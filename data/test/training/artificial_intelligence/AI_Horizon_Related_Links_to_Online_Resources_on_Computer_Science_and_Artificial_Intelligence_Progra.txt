A few of these links point to PDF or Postscript files. To read PDF files, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader , which can be downloaded for free from Adobe's website. Programming - Computer Science - AI - Game AI - Chess AI - Go AI - Local Programming Cprogramming.com A good site for beginners who want to learn C++, with a nice set of tutorials and a very good, active message board. This site is well-maintained and updated, so it is easy to navigate and learn from.   The Code Project A well written site with an expansive, active message-board system and a large number of articles on many specific programming topics. Although it is aimed towards more experienced programmers, it also has many beginner's articles.   Mark Watson's Loving Lisp - the Savy Programmer's Secret Weapon LISP ( Lis t P rocessing) is an often-used language for AI because of its recursive nature and small number of data-structures. This free book on the internet (it's supported by small donations) is a very handy introduction to this unique language (this book covers the Common Lisp variation). It comes in a 330 KB Zip file.   The Programmer's Heaven With many files to download, a very extensive list of links, and a very active message board, it is what the name declares: a programmer's heaven , especially for the beginners looking for information.   C++-Home A great site with large databases of C++ resources, including tutorials, source code, and links. The site also has programming contests and a set of C++ forums on programming topics from Algorithms to Windows/Unix programming. Computer Science Links to Online Algorithms Resources A nice collection to a variety of important and interesting algorithms from several fields, including encryption and genetic algorithms Free Online Dictionary of Computing (FOLDOC) A great dictionary for looking-up those strange terms that you may come across while reading about Computer Science and AI. It has entries of everything from recursion to finite-state machines, and the entries have full definitions that are extremely understandable. A very handy reference.   NIST Dictionary of Algorithms, Data Structures, and Problems This site defines just about any term you will come across while studying computer science and artificial intelligence. Although sometimes it can be a bit cryptic and terse, overall, it can be quite helpful in understanding the complex jargon of computer science and AI. CMU Artificial Intelligence Repository CMU's collection of FAQ's is an excellent source of information about AI. Although the site is not as easy to navigate as some of the others are, the FAQ's are easy to understand and read (for the most part).   ELIZA on the Web An adaptation of one of the most famous demonstrations of "Robot Intellect," this program was designed to participate in a Turing Test type situation. Apparently, some people were fooled by it! Try it out! It's fun!   Generation 5 A very helpful site full of well-written essays on AI , everything from the theoretical to the technical and specific. The site also has some downloadable files, many of which are compiled programs that can demonstrate certain algorithms. Although the essays are often very technical and specific, the site is still a great place for beginners to learn about AI.   Kurzweil AI A fun site, with flashy graphics and demos . This site is more weighted towards philosophy and doesn't have much technical information, so it should be easy for anyone to read. Beware, however, because this site is a bit media heavy, and so it might take a long time to load on a slow interent connection.   Mark Watson's Practical AI Programming in Java A great free book on the internet (it's supported by small donations). It covers the basics of AI programming , such as Searching algorithms (like the alpha-beta algorithm), Neural Networks, the Genetic Algorithm, and Natural Language Processing. It comes with lots of Java source code, so it's quite good to learn from. Go download the book!! (It is a 1.1 megabyte Zip file.)   GameAI.com A large site maintained by an experienced game programmer. It has a hundreds of links to online resources , as well as archived discussions on many game AI programming topics. Beginners might find it bewildering, but for those who are familiar with programming, it is a great guide to finding the information you need.   Machine Learning in Games A good place to find information on programming Go, Chess, and other games as well. It's a nice starting point for research, and should be quite interesting for beginners as well. Chess AI François Dominic Laramée's Chess Programming Articles These are a great introduction to Chess programming , and very extensive. It is easy to read and not very technical at all, perfect for the beginner. They come in 6 seperate parts: Getting Started Data Structures Move Generation Basic Search Techniques Advanced Search Techniques Evaluation Functions   Go AI AGA Computer Go Page Hosted by the American Go Association, this page is full of information about Go programming, from sample games between people and computers to analyses about computer program strengths and weaknesses.   Computer Go Mailing List This mailing list is mostly for programmers working on actual programs. It discusses many of the problems that developers have to deal with in making Go programs.   Evolving Go Playing Strategy in Neural Networks A paper in PDF format about the usefulness of Neural Networks and the Genetic Algorithm in Go programs, which are mostly knowledge databases and classical AI. An interesting discussion, but maybe a bit technical for the unintiated.   Machine Learning, Game Playing, and Go A paper in Postscript format about the relationship between Machine learning and Go , with analyses on a wide variety of commercial Go programs. It is quite interesting for anyone interested in programming Go. (The link is to a zip file, and the zip file contains the postscript file).   Michael Reiss's Computer Go Page An informative page by the creator of Go4++, one of the the top computer Go playing programs in the world. This page has links to many other internet resources on Go programming. All content is written and published by the people at or affiliated with AI Horizon < http://www.aihorizon.com/ >.
