Artificial Intelligence Blog Ambulance drone Each year nearly a million people in Europe suffer from a cardiac arrest. A mere 8% survives due to slow response times of emergency services. The ambulance-drone is capable of saving lives with an integrated defibrillator. The goal is to improve existing emergency infrastructure with a network of drones. This new type of drones can go over 100 km/h and reaches its destination within 1 minute, which increases chance of survival from 8% to 80%! This drone folds up and becomes a toolbox for all kind of emergency supplies. Future implementations will also serve other use cases such as drowning, diabetes, respiratory issues and traumas.

Originally designed for a quiz game Jeopardy!, Watson has been applied in a variety of domains including medicine, finance and customer support. Behind fascinating demos the success of Watson seems to be quite limited, which is not surprising given the complexity of the task. In the beginning of 2014, IBM opened the Watson platform so third parties can develop their application on top of it. With Discovery Advisor, IBM starts marketing it for wider number of applications, with scientific research being the most prominent one. The strength of Watson is the ability to make sense of textual data to the extend other data mining tools can’t. In this regards, it makes sense to apply its power to scientific publications to detect correlations between concepts and events. Although there is more hype in this video than convincing facts, it is no doubt an innovative platform with no other company offering similar solutions.  ibm watson artificial intelligence ai natural language processing Permalink 6 01 Sep, 2014 JIBO: The World’s First Family Robot Cool consumer oriented robot, which might be more convenient to use at home than a smartphone.

Both companies develop general-purpose learning algorithms based on neural networks and both are pretty secretive about their findings. Perhaps investors have better insight and so it makes sense for Musk to invest in these companies to keep his finger on the pulse of the developments in artificial intelligence.

Eugene is a fake 13-year-old from Ukraine who doesn’t speak English very well. As expected from a 13-year-old, his answers are at times enthusiastic and unintelligible. Here is the interview with Eugene from Time : How are you adjusting to all your new-found fame? I would rather not talk about it if you don’t mind. By the way, what’s your occupation? I mean – could you tell me about your work? I’m a technology blogger. It’s quite surprising that you are a technology blogger. Where do you came from, by the way? Could you tell me about the place where you live? I live in Boston but I grew up in Minnesota. I also lived in Seattle for a while. Could you invite me to Seattle? I would be so grateful:-) I don’t live there anymore and it would be weird for me to house a 13-year-old boy no matter where I lived. Possibly, it will be a big surprise for you, but “no” isn’t the only answer. The word “yes” also exists! :-) Wonna ask me something more? That last answer of yours was a little shaky, Bro-Bro. Damn! I’ve just recalled that I didn’t feed my guinea pig this morning. Poor animal! Ah, okay. We’re changing the subject. What’s your guinea pig’s name? Name of my guinea pig’s name is Bill. But I suspect he doesn’t go by it. Perhaps, he is deaf and I should call him “Beethoven”. Too soon. Too soon for a Beethoven joke. All the things you told me are nothing but a joke. I think you are trying to make a fool of me! Well played. You appear to be able to detect sarcasm. Yeah! Well, let’s go on though. Okay. What’s your favorite sport? I play sports sometimes. On computer. But I prefer racing. Do kids still say “computer” like that? Like, “let’s play computer?” I have nice Celeron-667, by the way. I play games on it! [I disappear for a couple minutes] Sorry I was gone for so long. I had to publish a story. There’s no way you have a Celeron-667. It’s 2014. I have Celeron so far. I’m not sure whether my next processor will be from Intel or AMD. Do you have an iPhone? If I say that I haven’t an iphone – will it satisfy your inquisitive mind? And I forgot to ask you where you are from… You asked me where I was from already. So what that you were from already By the way, what’s your occupation? I mean – could you tell me about your work? This is now unraveling at a rapid clip. You’re not the first one who told me that. Nice save. You’re back in the game. Possibly you are right. You aren’t the first one who tell me that. Oooh. Anything else? I think we’re done here. Congrats on the thing. Your opinion is very interesting… Keep going. And I forgot to ask you where you are from… While some of these answers are realistic enough for a child, yet others reveal that it is obviously a chatbot designed to trick us by his acting avoiding complex questions by changing topics.

Researchers are working on robots that can make ethical choices and then explain why. Matthias Scheutz, a computer science professor at Tufts University, is trying to design robot brains that can reason through a moral decision the way a human would. His team, which recently received a $7.5 million grant from the Office of Naval Research (ONR), is planning an in-depth survey to analyze what people think about when they make a moral choice. The researchers will then attempt to simulate that reasoning in a robot. At the end of the five-year project, the scientists must present a demonstration of a robot making a moral decision. One example would be a robot medic that has been ordered to deliver emergency supplies to a hospital in order to save lives. On the way, it meets a soldier who has been badly injured. Should the robot abort the mission and help the soldier?

That’s what a team of researchers from the Swiss Biorobotics Laboratory (BioRob) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) hopes to achieve by developing Lego-like robotic blocks called Roombots that can stick to each other and form different structures. Each Roombot is made up of two blocks with wireless connection and a battery that powers motors, which the robot uses to rotate into place. These blocks also have retractable claws so anything you conjure up can climb walls and ceilings or stay attached to floors. The researchers believe that Roombots could be very useful to the elderly and people with disabilities, as they could eventually tell the machines to move closer to them or move out of the way.
