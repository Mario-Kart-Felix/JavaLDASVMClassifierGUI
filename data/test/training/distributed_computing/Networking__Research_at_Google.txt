With an understanding that our distributed computing infrastructure is a key differentiator for the company, Google has long focused on building network infrastructure to support our scale, availability, and performance needs. Our research combines building and deploying novel networking systems at massive scale, with recent work focusing on fundamental questions around data center architecture, wide area network interconnects, Software Defined Networking control and management infrastructure, as well as congestion control and bandwidth allocation. By publishing our findings at premier research venues, we continue to engage both academic and industrial partners to further the state of the art in networked systems. 185 Publications       BBR: Congestion-Based Congestion Control Neal Cardwell , Yuchung Cheng , C.
