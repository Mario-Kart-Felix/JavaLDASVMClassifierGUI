Individualpointtopoint and synchronous communications lead to rigid and static applications, and make the development ofdynamic largescale applications cumbersome. To reduce the burden of applicationdesigners, the glue between the differententities in such largescale settings shouldrather be provided by a dedicated middleware infrastructure, based on an adequatecommunication scheme.The publishsubscribe interaction scheme is receiving increasing attention andis claimed to provide the loosely coupledform of interaction required in such largescale settings. Subscribers have the ability to express their interest in an event, ora pattern of events, and are subsequentlynotified of any event, generated by a publisher, which matches their registered interest. An event is asynchronously propagated to all subscribers that registeredinterest in that given event. The strengthof this eventbased interaction stylelies in the full decoupling in time, space,and synchronization between publishersand subscribers. Many industrial systems and research prototypes support thisstyle of interaction, and there are severalprominent research efforts on novel formsof publishsubscribe interaction schemes.However, because of the multiplicity ofthese systems and prototypes, it is difficult to capture their commonalities anddraw sharp lines between their mainvariations.The aim of this paper is threefold.First we point out the common denominators of publishsubscribe schemes time,space, and synchronization decoupling ofsubscribers and publishers. These decoupling dimensions are illustrated by comparing the publishsubscribe paradigmwith traditional interaction schemes.Second, we compare the many variants ofpublishsubscribe schemes namely, topicbased, contentbased, and typebased.Third, we discuss variations and tradeoffs in the design and implementation ofpublishsubscribebased systems throughspecific examples.2. THE BASIC INTERACTION SCHEMEThe publishsubscribe interaction paradigm provides subscribers with the abilityto express their interest in an event or apattern of events, in order to be notifiedsubsequently of any event, generated bya publisher, that matches their registeredinterest. In other terms, producers publishinformation on a software bus an eventmanager and consumers subscribe to theinformation they want to receive fromthat bus. This information is typicallydenoted by the term event and the act ofdelivering it by the term notification.The basic system model for publishsubscribe interaction Figure 1 relies onan event notification service providingstorage and management for subscriptions and efficient delivery of events. Suchan event service represents a neutral mediator between publishers, acting as producers of events, and subscribers, actingACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.116 Eugster et al.Fig. 2. Space, time, and synchronization decoupling with the publishsubscribe paradigm.as consumers of events. Subscribers register their interest in events by typicallycalling a subscribe operation on theevent service, without knowing the effective sources of these events. This subscription information remains stored inthe event service and is not forwardedto publishers. The symmetric operationunsubscribe terminates a subscription.To generate an event, a publisher typically calls a publish operation. Theevent service propagates the event to allrelevant subscribers it can thus be viewedas a proxy for the subscribers. Note thatevery subscriber will be notified of everyevent conforming to its interest obviously,failures might prevent subscribers fromreceiving some events. Publishers also often have the ability to advertise the nature of their future events through anadvertise operation. The provided information can be useful for 1 the eventservice to adjust itself to the expectedflows of events, and 2 the subscribers tolearn when a new type of information becomes available.The decoupling that the event serviceprovides between publishers and subscribers can be decomposed along the following three dimensions Figure 2Space decoupling The interacting parties do not need to know each other.The publishers publish events throughan event service and the subscribersget these events indirectly through theevent service. The publishers do not usually hold references to the subscribers,neither do they know how many of thesesubscribers are participating in the interaction. Similarly, subscribers do notusually hold references to the publishers, neither do they know how many ofthese publishers are participating in theinteraction.Time decoupling The interacting parties do not need to be actively participating in the interaction at the sametime. In particular, the publisher mightpublish some events while the subscriber is disconnected, and conversely, the subscriber might get notifiedabout the occurrence of some eventwhile the original publisher of the eventis disconnected.Synchronization decoupling Publishersare not blocked while producing events,and subscribers can get asynchronouslynotified through a callback of the occurrence of an event while performing someconcurrent activity. The production andconsumption of events do not happen inthe main flow of control of the publishers and subscribers, and do not thereforehappen in a synchronous manner.ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 117Decoupling the production and consumption of information increases scalability by removing all explicit dependencies between the interacting participants.In fact, removing these dependenciesstrongly reduces coordination and thussynchronization between the different entities, and makes the resulting communication infrastructure well adapted todistributed environments that are asynchronous by nature, such as mobile environments Huang and GarciaMolina2001.Complementary classifications of the interaction models of distributed information systems have been proposed in theliterature. Franklin and Zdonik 1997classified disseminationbased systemsaccording to their data delivery mechanisms push versus pull, aperiodic versus periodic, and unicast versus 1toN.Pushbased information systems havebeen studied extensively Hauswirth andJazayeri 1999 Hauswirth 1999. Similar characterizations are used in softwareengineering Sullivan and Notkin 1990Garlan and Notkin 1991 and coordinationmodels Papadopoulos and Arbab 1998.3. THE COUSINS ALTERNATIVECOMMUNICATION PARADIGMSMessage passing, remote invocations, notifications, shared spaces, and messagequeuing do all constitute alternativecommunication paradigms to the publishsubscribe scheme. They stand at different abstraction levels and are not easyto compare. Nevertheless, we overviewbelow their commonalities with publishsubscribe systems and emphasizetheir inability to fully decouple communication between participants.3.1. Message PassingMessage passing can be viewed as the ancestor of distributed interactions. Messagepassing represents a lowlevel form of distributed communication, in which participants communicate by simply sendingand receiving messages. Although complex interaction schemes are still builton top of such primitives, message passFig. 3. Message passing interaction the producersends messages asynchronously through a communication channel previously set up for that purpose.The consumer receives messages by listening synchronously on that channel.ing is nowadays rarely used directly fordeveloping distributed applications, sincephysical addressing and data marshaling,and sometimes even flow control e.g., retransmission, become visible to the application layer. Message passing is asynchronous for the producer, while messageconsumption is generally synchronous.The producer and the consumer are coupled both in time and space cf. Figure 3they must both be active at the same timeand the recipient of a message is known tothe sender.3.2. RPCOne of the most widely used forms of distributed interaction is the remote invocation, an extension of the notion of operation invocation to a distributed context.This type of interaction was first proposedin the form of a remote procedure callRPC Birrell and Nelson 1983 Tay andAnanda 1990 for procedural languages,and has been straightforwardly appliedto objectoriented contexts in the form ofremote method invocations, for example,in Java RMI Sun 2000, CORBA OMG2002a, Microsoft DCOM Horstmann andKirtland 1997 Chung et al. 1998.By making remote interactions appearthe same way as local interactions, theRPC model and its derivatives make distributed programming very easy. This explains their tremendous popularity in distributed computing. Distribution cannot,however, be made completely transparentto the application, because it gives riseto further types of potential failures e.g.,communication failures that have to beACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.118 Eugster et al.Fig. 4. RPC and derivatives the producer performs a synchronous call, which is processed asynchronously by the consumer.dealt with explicitly. As shown in Figure 4,RPC differs from publishsubscribe interms of coupling the synchronous nature of RPC introduces a strong time,synchronization on the consumer side1,and also space coupling since an invokingobject holds a remote reference to each ofits invokees.Several attempts have been made to remove synchronization coupling in remoteand avoid blocking the caller thread whilewaiting for the reply of a remote invocation. A first variant consists in providing a special flavor of asynchronous invocation for remote methods that haveno return values, as shown in Figure 5.For instance, CORBA OMG 2002a provides a special oneway modifier that canbe used to specify such methods. This approach leads to invocations with weak reliability guarantees because the senderdoes not receive success or failure notifications this type of interaction is oftencalled fireandforget. The second, less restrictive variant supports return values,but does not make them directly availableto the calling thread. Instead, the resultFig. 5. Decoupling synchronization with asynchronous remote invocation the producer does notexpect a reply.1 The distinction between consumer and producerroles is not straightforward in RPC. We assume herethat an RPC that yields a reply attributes a consumerrole to the invoker, while the invokee acts as producer. As we will point out, the roles are inverted withasynchronous invocations which yield no reply.Fig. 6. Decoupling synchronization with future remote invocation the producer is not blocked and canaccess the reply later when it becomes available.of a remote invocation is a handle throughwhich the actual return values will be accessed when needed. With this approach,known as future or future type messagepassing Yonezawa et al. 1987 Anandaet al. 1992 or waitbynecessity Caromel1993, the invoking thread can continueprocessing and request the return valuelater, thanks to the handle Figure 6.3.3. NotificationsIn order to achieve synchronization decoupling, a synchronous remote invocation issometimes split into two asynchronous invocations the first one sent by the clientto the serveraccompanied by the invocation arguments and a callback reference to the clientand the second onesent by the server to the client to returnthe reply. This scheme can be easily extended to return several replies by having the server make several callbacks tothe client. Such notificationbased interaction is widely used to ensure consistencyof Web caches Wessels 1995 upon download of Web contents, Web proxies receive apromise to be notified if any change occursat the Web server. This implements a limited form of publishsubscribe interactionin which Web proxies act as subscribersand the Web server as the publisher.This type of interactionwhere subscribers register their interest directlywith publishers, which manage subscriptions and send eventscorresponds to thesocalled observer design pattern Gammaet al. 1995 Figure 7. It is generally implemented using asynchronous invocations in order to enforce synchronization decoupling. Although publishersnotify subscribers asynchronously, theyACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 119Fig. 7. Notifications producers and consumerscommunicate using asynchronous invocations flowing in both directions.both remain coupled in time and in space.Furthermore the communication management is left to the publisher and can become burdensome as the system grows insize.3.4. Shared SpacesThe distributed shared memory DSMparadigm Li and Hudak 1989 Tamet al. 1990 provides hosts in a distributed system with the view of a common shared space across disjoint address spaces, in which synchronizationand communication between participantstake place through operations on shareddata. The notion of tuple space was originally integrated at the language level inLinda Gelernter 1985, and provides asimple and powerful abstraction for accessing shared memory. A tuple space iscomposed of a collection of ordered tuples, equally accessible to all hosts of adistributed system. Communication between hosts takes place through the insertionremoval of tuples intofrom the tuplespace. Three main operations can be performed out to export a tuple into a tuplespace, in to import and remove a tuplefrom the tuple space, and read to readwithout removing a tuple from the tuplespace.The interaction model provides timeand space decoupling, in that tuple producers and consumers remain anonymouswith respect to each other. The creator of atuple needs no knowledge about the futureuse of that tuple or its destination. An inbased interaction implements oneofn semantics only one consumer reads a giventuple whereas readbased interaction canbe used to implement oneton messagedelivery a given tuple can be read byall such consumers. Unlike the publishsubscribe paradigm, the DSM modeldoes not provide synchronization decoupling because consumers pull new tuplesfrom the space in a synchronous styleFigure 8. This limits the scalability of themodel due to the required synchronizationbetween the participants. To compensatethe lack of synchronization decoupling,some modern tuple space systems likeJavaSpaces Sun 2002, TSpaces Lehmanet al. 1999, and WCL Rowstron 1998extend the Linda tuple space model withasynchronous notifications.A similar communication abstraction,called rendezvous, has been introducedin the Internet Indirection InfrastructureI3 Stoica et al. 2002. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, eachpacket is associated with an identifier thisidentifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending fromthe act of receiving.3.5. Message QueuingMessage queuing Blakeley et al. 1995 isa more recent alternative for distributedinteraction. In fact, the term messagequeuing is often used to refer to a familyof products e.g., IBM Corporation 1995Houston 1998 DEC 1994 Oracle2002 rather than to a specific interaction scheme. Message queuing andpublishsubscribe are tightly intertwined message queuing systems usuallyintegrate some form of publishsubscribelike interaction. Such messagecentricFig. 8. Shared space producers insert data asynchronously into the shared space, while consumersread data synchronously.ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.120 Eugster et al.Fig. 9. Message queuing messages are stored ina FIFO queue. Producers append messages asynchronously at the end of the queue, while consumersdequeue them synchronously at the front of thequeue.approaches are often referred to asmessageoriented middleware MOMBanavar et al. 1999b.At the interaction level, message queuesrecall much of tuple spaces queues can beseen as global spaces, which are fed withmessages from producers. From a functional point of view, message queuing systems additionally provide transactional,timing, and ordering guarantees not necessarily considered by tuple spaces.In message queuing systems, messagesare concurrently pulled by consumers withoneofn semantics similar to those offeredby tuple spaces through the in operationFigure 9. These interaction model is often also referred to as pointtopoint PTPqueuing. Which element is retrieved by aconsumer is not defined by the elementsstructure, but by the order in which the elements are stored in the queue generallyfirstin firstout FIFO or prioritybasedorder.Similarly to tuple spaces, producers andconsumers are decoupled in both time andspace. As consumers synchronously pullmessages, message queues do not providesynchronization decoupling. Some message queuing systems offer limited support for asynchronous message delivery,but these asynchronous mechanisms donot scale well to large populations of consumers because of the additional interactions needed to maintain transactional,timing, and ordering guarantees.3.6. SummaryTraditional interaction paradigms essentially differ from publishsubscribeFig. 10. The publishsubscribe interaction paradigm decouples consumers and producers in termsof space, time, and synchronization.communication Figure 10 by their limited support for time, space and synchronization decoupling. Table 1 summarizesthe decoupling properties of the aforementioned communication models.4. THE SIBLINGS PUBLISHSUBSCRIBEVARIATIONSSubscribers are usually interested in particular events or event patterns, and notin all events. The different ways of specifying the events of interest have led toseveral subscription schemes. In this section we compare the two most widely usedschemes, namely topicbased and contentbased publishsubscribe, as well the recently proposed typebased subscriptionscheme.4.1. TopicBased PublishSubscribeThe earliest publishsubscribe scheme wasbased on the notion of topics or subjects,and has been implemented by many industrial strength solutions e.g., Altherret al. 1999 Talarian Corporation 1999Skeen 1998 TIBCO 1999. It extendsthe notion of channels, used to bundle communicating peers, with methods to characterize and classify event content. Participants can publish events and subscribeto individual topics, which are identifiedby keywords. Topics are strongly similar to the notion of groups, as definedin the context of group communicationPowell 1996 and often used for replication Birman 1993. This similarity isnot surprising, since some of the firstsystems to offer publishsubscribe interaction were based on the Isis Birmanet al. 1990 group communication toolkitand the subscription scheme was thusACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 121Table 1.

Consequently,subscribing to a topic T can be viewedas becoming a member of a group T , andpublishing an event on topic T translates accordingly into broadcasting thatevent among the members of T . Althoughgroups and topics are similar abstractions,they are generally associated with different application domains groups are usedfor maintaining strong consistency between the replicas of a critical componentin a local area network LAN, whereastopics are used to model largescale distributed interactions.In practice, topicbased publishsubscribe systems introduce a programming abstraction which maps individualtopics to distinct communication channels. They present interfaces similar tothose of the event service discussed inSection 2, and the topic name is usuallyspecified as an initialization argument.Every topic is viewed as an event serviceof its own, identified by a unique name,with an interface offering publish andsubscribe operations.The topic abstraction is easy to understand, and enforces platform interoperability by relying only on strings as keysto divide the event space. Additions to thetopicbased scheme have been proposed byvarious systems. The most useful improvement is the use of hierarchies to orchestrate topics. While groupbased systemsoffer flat addressing, where groups represent disconnected event spaces, nearly allmodern topicbased engines offer a formof hierarchical addressing, which permitsprogrammers to organize topics according to containment relationships. A subscription made to some node in the hierarchy implicitly involves subscriptions toall the subtopics of that node. Topic namesare generally represented with a URLlike notation and introduce a hierarchyvery similar to the USENET news. Mostsystems allow topic names to containwildcards, first introduced in TIBCORendezvous TIBCO 1999, which offer thepossibility to subscribe and publish to several topics whose names match a given setof keywords, like an entire subtree or aspecific level in the hierarchy.Consider the example of stock quotesdisseminated to a large number of interested brokers. In a first step, we are interested in buying stocks, advertised by stockquote events. Such events consist of fiveattributes a global identifier, the nameof the company, the price, the amount ofstocks, and the identifier of the sellingtrader. Figure 11 shows how to subscribeto all stock quotes, and Figure 12 givesan overview of the resulting distributedinteraction.4.2. ContentBased PublishSubscribeDespite improvements like hierarchicaladdressing facilities and wildcards, thetopicbased publishsubscribe variant represents a static scheme which offers onlylimited expressiveness. The contentbasedor propertybased Rosenblum and Wolf1997 publishsubscribe variant improveson topics by introducing a subscriptionscheme based on the actual content ofthe considered events. In other terms,events are not classified according to somepredefined external criterion e.g., topicname, but according to the propertiesof the events themselves. Such properties can be internal attributes of datastructures carrying events, as in GryphonACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.122 Eugster et al.Fig. 11. Sample code for topicbased publishsubscribe.Banavar et al. 1999a, Siena Carzanigaet al. 2000, Elvin Segall et al. 2000, andJedi Cugola et al. 2001, or metadataassociated to events, as in the Java Message Service Hapner et al. 2002.Consumers subscribe to selective eventsby specifying filters using a subscriptionlanguage. The filters define constraints,usually in the form of namevalue pairsof properties and basic comparison operators , , , , , which identifyvalid events. Constraints can be logicallycombined and, or, etc. to form complexsubscription patterns. Some systems, likethe Cambridge Event Architecture CEABacon et al. 2000, also provide for eventcorrelation participants can subscribe tological combinations of elementary eventsand are only notified upon occurrence ofthe composite events. Subscription patterns are used to identify the eventsof interest for a given subscriber andpropagate events accordingly. For subscribing, a variant of the subscribeoperation is provided by the event service, with an additional argument repFig. 12. Topicbased publishsubscribe interactions.resenting a subscription pattern. Thereare several means of representing suchpatternsString Subscription patterns are mostfrequently expressed using strings.Filters must conform to a subscription grammar, such as SQL Hapneret al. 2002 Oracle 2002 Lewis 1999,OMGs Default Filter Constraint Language OMG 2002b, XPath Altineland Franklin 2000 Chan et al. 2002aDiao et al. 2002, or some proprietary language Banavar et al. 1999aCarzaniga et al. 2001 Segall and Arnold1997. Strings are then parsed by theengine.Template object Inspired by tuplebasedmatching, JavaSpaces Freeman et al.1999 adopts an approach based on template objects. When subscribing, a participant provides an object t, which indicates that the participant is interestedin every event that conforms to the typeof t and whose attributes all match thecorresponding attributes of t, except forthe ones carrying a wildcard null.Executable code Subscribers provide apredicate object able to filter events atruntime. The implementation of thatobject is usually left to the application developer. An alternative approach,based on a library of filter objects implemented using reflection, was describedin Eugster and Guerraoui 2001. Executable code is not widely used in practice because the resulting filters are extremely hard to optimize.ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 123Fig. 13. Sample code for contentbased publishsubscribe.Figures 13 and 14 illustrate the useof stringbased filters. The example outlines how a contentbased scheme enforcesa finer granularity than a static schemebased on topics. To achieve the samefunctionality with topics, the subscriberwould either have to filter out irrelevantevents, or topics would need to be splitinto several subtopicsone for each company and recursively several subtopicsfor different price categories. The firstapproach leads to an inefficient use ofbandwidth, while the second approach results in a high number of topics and anincreased risk of redundant events.4.3. TypeBased PublishSubscribeTopics usually regroup events that presentcommonalities not only in content, butalso in structure. This observation has ledto the idea of replacing the namebasedtopic classification model by a schemethat filters events according to their typeEugster et al. 2001. In other terms, theFig. 14. Contentbased publishsubscribe interactions.Fig. 15. Sample code for typebased publishsubscribe.notion of event kind is directly matchedwith that of event type. This enables acloser integration of the language and themiddleware. Moreover, type safety can beensured at compiletime by parameterizing the resulting abstraction interface bythe type of the corresponding events without any type cast in the resulting code.In contrast, the aforementioned templatebased approach of JavaSpaces Freemanet al. 1999 considers the type of eventsas a dynamic property, and the resulting JavaSpace API forces the applicationto perform explicit type casts. Similarly,the TAO CORBA Event Service Harrisonet al. 1997 does not view the type of anevent object as an implicit attribute.The example in Figure 15 illustratestypebased subscription. Stock events canbe split into two distinct types stock quotesfor sale and stock requests, as shownin Figure 16. Brokers use stock requeststo express their interest in buying stock.In contrast to quotes, requests have arange of possible prices. Subtyping can beused to subscribe to both stock quotes andrequests.It is important to notice that typebased publishsubscribe can lead to a natural description of contentbased filteringthrough public members of the consideredevent type, while ensuring the encapsulation of these events. This is achieved inour example of Figure 15 by declaring onlyACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.124 Eugster et al.Fig. 16. Typebased publishsubscribe interactions.private data members and enforcing theiraccess through public methods.4.4. SummaryThere exist several variants for designing publishsubscribe systems, which offerdifferent degrees of expressiveness and,as we shall see in Section 5, differentperformance overhead. Topicbased publishsubscribe is rather static and primitive, but can be implemented very efficiently. On the other hand, contentbasedpublishsubscribe is highly expressive, butrequires sophisticated protocols that havehigher runtime overhead. Because of thisadditional overhead, one should generallyprefer a static scheme whenever a primary property ranges over a limited setof possible discrete values, for example,stock quotesrequests. As outlined inEugster and Guerraoui 2001, additionalexpressiveness can be achieved by applying contentbased filters in the context ofstatically configured topics, in particulartypes, to express constraints on propertiesthat are not within discrete ranges e.g.,stock prices.5. THE INCARNATIONS IMPLEMENTATIONISSUESThis section discusses some implementation issues underlying publishsubscribeschemes, and how these issues are addressed in current systems and prototypes. We focus on three major aspects ofpublishsubscribe middleware the events,the media, and qualities of service, in thecontext of the classification introduced inthe previous sections. Furthermore, wediscuss the different tradeoffs that resultfrom different approaches, in terms of flexibility, reliability, scalability, and performance. Additional details on specific implementation issues of publishsubscribesystems can be found in Rosenblum andWolf 1997 Banavar et al. 1999a andTai and Rouvellou 2000.5.1. EventsEvents are found in two forms messagesor invocations. In the first case, events aredelivered to a subscriber through a singlegeneric operation e.g., notify, while inthe second case events trigger the execution of specific operations of the subscriber.5.1.1. Messages. At the lowest level,any data that goes on the network is amessage. In most systems, event notifications take the form of messages, which areexplicitly created by the application. Messages are generally made of a header thatcontains messagespecific information in ageneric format, and payload data that contains userspecific information. Typicalheader fields include message identifier,issuer, priority, or expiration time, whichcan be interpreted by the system or purelyserve as information for the consumers.Some systems e.g., IBM MQSeries Lewis1999 and Oracle Advanced QueuingOracle 2002 do not make any assumption on the type of the payload data andtreat it as an opaque array of bytes. Someother systems e.g., JMS Hapner et al.2002, CORBA Notification Service OMG2002b provide a set of message types,such as text or XML messages. Finally,some systems provide selfdescribing messages. TIBCO Rendezvous TIBCO 1999,ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 125for instance, defines a message formatthat does not have header information,but allows the programmer to create hisor her own message structure based on aset of basic types that can be structuredhierarchically. The type of messages canbe queried later at runtime. DistributedAsynchronous Collections DAC Eugsteret al. 2000 and Java Message ServiceJMS Hapner et al. 2002 even supportobject messages, where the event can beany serializable Java object. In most cases,messages are viewed as records with several fields.5.1.2. Invocations. At a higher level,we generally differentiate between invocations and messages. An invocation isdirected to a specific type of object, andhas welldefined semantics. The systemensures that all consumers have a matching interface for processing the invocation.The interface acts as a binding contractbetween the invoker and the invokees.Systems which offer invocationstyleinteraction along with different semantics and various addressing schemes areusually termed messaging systems. Theyincorporate additional logic on top of apublishsubscribe or message queuing system to transform lowlevel messages intoinvocations to methods of the subscribers,which must all be of the same type. Whilecertain systems take into account returnvalues of invocations, the typed publishsubscribe models of COM Sessions1997 or the CORBA Event Service OMG2001 typically only consider onewayinvocations. Producers invoke operationson some intermediary object e.g., eventchannel that exhibits the same interfaceas the actual consumers and forwardsevents to all registered consumers. COMfurthermore provides a form of contentbased filtering, by offering the possibilityto specify values for invocation arguments in order to restrict the potentialinvocations.5.2. The MediaThe transmission of data between producers and consumers is the task of themiddleware medium. Media can be classified according to characteristics like theirarchitecture or the guarantees they provide for the data, such as persistence orreliability.5.2.1. Architectures. The role of publishsubscribe systems is to permit the exchange of events between producers andconsumers in an asynchronous manner.Asynchrony can be implemented by having producers send messages to a specific entity that stores them, and forwardsthem to consumers on demand. We callthis approach a centralized architecturebecause of the central entity that storesand forwards messages. This approachis adopted by queuing systems like theIBM MQSeries Lewis 1999 and OracleAdvanced Queuing Oracle 2002, eachof which is built on top of a centralizeddatabase. Applications based on such systems have strong requirements in termsof reliability, data consistency, or transactional support, but do not need a highdata throughput. Examples of such applications are electronic commerce or banking applications.Asynchrony can also be implementedby using smart communication primitivesthat implement store and forward mechanisms both in the producers and consumers processes, so that communicationappears asynchronous and anonymous tothe application without the need for an intermediary entity. We call this approach adistributed architecture because there isno central entity in the system. TIBCORendezvous TIBCO 1999 uses a decentralized approach in which no process actsas a bottleneck or a single point of failure. Such architectures are well suitedfor fast and efficient delivery of transient data, which is required for applications like stock exchange or multimediabroadcasting.An intermediate approach, adopted forinstance by Gryphon Banavar et al.1999a, Siena Carzaniga et al. 2000,and Jedi Cugola et al. 2001, consists inimplementing the event notification service as a distributed network of servers.In contrast to completely decentralizedACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.126 Eugster et al.systems, this approach discharges the participating processes by using dedicatedservers to execute the complex protocols required for persistence, reliability, orhighavailability, as well as for contentbased filtering and routing. There are different topologies for these servers. Jedisevent dispatchers are organized in a hierarchical structure, where clients canconnect to any node. Subscriptions arepropagated upward the tree of servers.Such hierarchical topologies tend, however, to heavily load the root servers,and the failure of a server might disconnect the entire subtree. In Gryphon,a graph summarizing the common interests of subscribers is superimposed withthe message broker graph, to avoid redundant matches. Siena uses subscriptionand advertisement forwarding to set thepaths for notifications. Event servers keeptrack of useful information to efficientlymatch events with subscriptions. Several server topologies have been considered, each with respective advantages andshortcomings.5.2.2. Dissemination. The actual transmission of data can happen in variousways. In particular, data can be sent usingpointtopoint communication primitives,or using hardware multicast facilities likeIP multicast Deering n.d.. The choice ofthe communication mechanism dependson factors such as the target environmentand the architecture of the system.Centralized approaches like certainmessage queuing systems are likely to usepointtopoint communication primitivesbetween producersconsumers and thecentralized broker. As already mentioned,these systems focus more on strong guarantees than on high throughput and scalability. Topicbased publishsubscribe systems can straightforwardly benefit fromthe vast amount of studies on group communication Powell 1996 and the resulting protocols to disseminate eventsto subscribers. To ensure high throughput, Internet protocol IP multicast ora wide range of reliable multicast protocols Floyd et al. 1997 Holbrook et al.1995 Lin and Paul 1996 Castro et al.2002 Banerjee et al. 2002 Ratnasamyet al. 2001 Zhuang et al. 2001 are commonly employed.Efficient multicast of events in contentbased publishsubscribe systems remainsan issue. Gryphon and Siena both use algorithms Aguilera et al. 1999 Carzanigaet al. 2001 that deliver events to a logical network of servers in such a way thatan event is propagated only to the serversthat manage subscribers interested bythat event. The performance of suchdisseminationbased systems is stronglyaffected by the cost of event filtering oneach of the servers, which directly dependson the number of subscriptions in the system. Highly efficient and scalable algorithms have been recently proposed for filtering data in publishsubscribe systemsAltinel and Franklin 2000 Pereira et al.2000 Fabret et al. 2001 Campailla et al.2001 Chan et al. 2002a Diao et al. 2002.The problem of aggregating subscriptionsto increase the filtering speed at eachserver, at the price of a small loss in precision, has been studied in Chan et al.2002a. Irrespective of the filtering techniques, the selective event routing inherent to contentbased publishsubscribemakes the exploitation of networklevelmulticast primitives difficult.5.3. Qualities of ServiceThe guarantees provided by the mediumfor every message vary strongly betweenthe different systems. Among the mostcommon qualities of service consideredin publishsubscribe, we have persistence,transactional guarantees, and priorities.5.3.1. Persistence. In RPClike systems,a method invocation is by definition a transient event. The lifetime of a remote invocation is short and, if the invokee does notget a reply after a given period of time, itmay reissue the request. The situation isdifferent in publishsubscribe or queuingsystems. Messages may be sent withoutgenerating replies, and they may be processed hours after having been sent. Thecommunicating parties do not control howmessages are transmitted and when theyACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 127are processed. Thus, the messaging system must provide guarantees not only interms of reliability, but also in terms ofdurability of the information. It is not sufficient to know that a message has reachedthe messaging system that sits betweenthe producers and consumers we mustget the guarantee that the message willnot be lost upon failure of that messagingsystem.Persistence is generally present in publishsubscribe systems that have a centralized architecture and store messages untilconsumers are able to process them. Queuing systems like the IBM MQSeries Lewis1999 and Oracle Advanced QueuingOracle 2002 offer persistence using anunderlying database. Distributed publishsubscribe systems do not generallyoffer persistence since messages are directly sent by the producer to all subscribers. Unless the producer keeps a copyof each message, a faulty subscriber maynot be able to get missed messages whenrecovering. TIBCO Rendezvous TIBCO1999 offers a mixed approach, in whicha process may listen to specific subjects,store messages on persistent storage, andresend missed messages to recovering subscribers. The Cambridge Event Architecture Bacon et al. 2000 provides a potentially distributed event repository forevent storage and efficient retrieval withsearching facilities for simple and composite events that enables the replaying ofstored sequences of events.5.3.2. Priorities. Like persistence, message prioritization is a quality of service offered by some messaging systems. Indeed,it may be desirable to sort the messageswaiting to be processed by a consumerin order of priority. For instance, a realtime event may require immediate reaction e.g., failure notification and shouldbe processed before other messages.Priorities affect messages that are intransit, that is, not being processed. Runtime execution priorities are handled bythe application scheduler and are notmanaged by the messaging system. In particular, this implies that two subscriberslistening to the same topics may processmessages in different orders because theyprocess messages at different speeds, eventhough communication channels are firstin, first out FIFO. Priorities should beconsidered as a besteffort quality of service unlike persistence.Most publishsubscribe messaging systems centralized or distributed providepriorities, although the number of priorities and the way they are applied differ. IBM MQSeries Lewis 1999, OracleAdvanced Queuing Oracle 2002, TIBCORendezvous TIBCO 1999, and the JMSspecification Hapner et al. 2002 all support priorities.5.3.3. Transactions. Transactions aregenerally used to group multiple operations in atomic blocks that are eithercompletely executed or not executed at all.In messaging systems, transactions areused to group messages into atomic unitseither a complete sequence of messagesis sent received, or none of them is. Forinstance, a producer that publishes several semantically related messages maynot want consumers to see a partial inconsistent sequence of messages if it failsduring emission. Similarly, a missioncritical application may want to consumeone or several messages, process them,and only then commit the transaction. Ifthe consumer fails before committing, allmessages are still available for reprocessing after recovery.Due to their tight integration withdatabases, IBM MQSeries Lewis 1999and Oracle Advanced Queuing Oracle2002 provide a wide range of transactional mechanisms. JMS Hapner et al.2002 and TIBCO Rendezvous TIBCO1999 also provide transaction supportfor grouping messages in the context of asingle session. JavaSpaces Freeman et al.1999 provides lightweight transactionalmechanisms to guarantee atomicity ofevent production and consumption. Anevent published in a JavaSpace in thecontext of a transaction is not visibleoutside the transaction until it is committed. Similarly, a consumed event isnot removed from a JavaSpace until theACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.128 Eugster et al.enclosing transaction commits. Severalevents can be produced and consumed inthe context of the same transaction.5.3.4. Reliability. Reliability is an important feature of distributed informationsystems. It is often necessary to havestrong guarantees about the reliable delivery of information to one or severaldistributed entities. Because of the loosesynchronization between producers andconsumers of information, implementingreliable event propagation guaranteeddelivery is challenging.Centralized publishsubscribe systemsgenerally use reliable pointtopoint channels to communicate with publishers andsubscribers, and keep copies of eventson stable storage. Events are thereforereliably delivered to all subscribers, although a failure of the centralized eventbroker may delay delivery.Systems based on an overlay networkof distributed event brokers often use reliable protocols to propagate events to all ora subset of the brokers. Protocols based ongroup communication Powell 1996 andreliable applicationlayer multicast Floydet al. 1997 Holbrook et al. 1995 Lin andPaul 1996 Castro et al. 2002 Banerjeeet al. 2002 Ratnasamy et al. 2001 Zhuanget al. 2001 are good candidates as theyare resilient to the failure of some of thebrokers. Individual publishers and subscribers generally communicate with thenearer broker using pointtopoint communication channels.Finally, systems that let publishers andsubscriber communicate directly witheach other, such as TIBCO RendezvousTIBCO 1999, also use lightweight reliable multicast protocols. As events aregenerally not kept in the system forfailed or disconnected timedecoupledsubscribers, guaranteed delivery must beimplemented by deploying dedicated processes that store events and replay themto requesting subscribers.6. CONCLUDING REMARKSPublishsubscribe is a distributed interaction paradigm well adapted to the deployment of scalable and loosely coupled systems. To survey and comparedistributed eventbased abstractions, wehave introduced a classification basedon three dimensions the decoupling intime, space, and synchronization betweenproducers and consumers of information.Decoupling is a desirable property because it enforces scalability at the abstraction level, by allowing participantsto operate independently of one another.At the implementation level, however,scalability remains a sensitive issue, because publishsubscribe interaction canbe built on top of various communication substrates and can easily be hampered by an inappropriate architecture,in particular when publishsubscribe systems are built on top of infrastructuresthat were not designed with scalability inmind.Scalability also often conflicts withother desirable properties. For instance,highly expressive and selective subscriptions require complex and expensive filtering and routing algorithms, and thuslimit scalability. Similarly, strong reliability guarantees involve important overheads, because events must be logged,and missed events must be detected andretransmitted. Even protocols developedespecially for widearea networks, suchas the senderreliable Reliable MulticastTransport Protocol RMTP Lin and Paul1996, do not scale well to large numbersof subscribers because of the considerableamount of traffic resulting from messageacknowledgments.Recently, probabilistic protocols havereceived increasing attention since theymatch the decoupled and peerbased nature of publishsubscribe systems. Insteadof providing deterministic guaranteed reliability, probabilistic multicast protocolsensure that a given event will reach allsubscribers with a very high and quantifiable probability Birman et al. 1999. Integration of such probabilistic protocols incontentbased publishsubscribe systemsremains a challenging issue.While programming abstractions forpublishsubscribe are plentiful, designingappropriate algorithms for deploying suchACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 35, No. 2, June 2003.The Many Faces of PublishSubscribe 129systems on a large scale is still an openissue, and tradeoffs must be dealt with tocope with scalability, expressiveness andquality of service. Significant research efforts remain to be invested, in particularas tribute to the unpredictability of theInternet.REFERENCESAGUILERA, M. K., STROM, R. E., STURMAN, D. C., ASTLEY,M., AND CHANDRA, T.
