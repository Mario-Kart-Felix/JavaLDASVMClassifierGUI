He works at the intersection of spatial and temporal big data management, analytics, and high performance computing with applications in the national security, geospatial intelligence, natural resources, climate change, location-based services, and human terrain mapping. As the Associate Director of the Center for Geospatial Analytics (CGA), Raju plays a leadership role in the center’s strategic vision for spatial computing research. Before joining NCSU, Raju was the Lead Data Scientist for the Computational Sciences and Engineering Division (CSED) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Raju has more than 25 years of research and development experience in large-scale spatiotemporal data management and geographic knowledge discovery. He worked at many leading research laboratories: ORNL (2006-2014), IBM-Research (IRL, IIT-Delhi Campus, 2004-2006), University of Minnesota (Remote Sensing Laboratory, St. Paul, USA. 1999-2004), AT&T Labs (R&D HQ, Middletown, NJ. USA. 2008), and the Center for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC, Pune University Campus, India. 2005-2008). He has published more than 80 peer-reviewed articles in conferences and journals, and edited two books on “Knowledge Discovery from Sensor Data.” He served on program committees of leading international conference including ACM KDD, ACM GIS, ECML/PKDD, SDM, CIKM, IEEE BigData, and co-chaired several workshops including ICDM/SSTDM, ICDM/KDCloud, ACM SIGSPATIAL BigSpatial, Supercomputing/BDAC, KDD/LDMTA, KDD/Sensor-KDD, and SDM/ACS. He holds MS and PhD degrees in computer science from the University of Minnesota.
