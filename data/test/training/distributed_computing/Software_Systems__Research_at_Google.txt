Building on our hardware foundation, we develop technology across the entire systems stack, from operating system device drivers all the way up to multi-site software systems that run on hundreds of thousands of computers. We design, build and operate warehouse-scale computer systems that are deployed across the globe. We build storage systems that scale to exabytes, approach the performance of RAM, and never lose a byte. We design algorithms that transform our understanding of what is possible. Thanks to the distributed systems we provide our developers, they are some of the most productive in the industry. And we write and publish research papers to share what we have learned, and because peer feedback and interaction helps us build better systems that benefit everybody. 243 Publications       Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation with Asynchronous Off-Policy Updates Shixiang Gu, Ethan Holly, Timothy Lillicrap, Sergey Levine ICRA (2017) (to appear)       ;login: Interrupt Reduction Projects Betsy (Adrienne Elizabeth) Beyer , John Tobin, Liz Fong-Jones ;login:, vol.
