Home Programmes Undergraduates CS Focus Areas Computer Science Focus Areas for BComp (CS) CS modules are organised into Focus Areas of coherent modules according to technical areas of study. A CS Focus Area is satisfied by completing 3 modules from the Area Primaries, with at least one module at level-4000 or above. CS Foundation Modules (CFM) that appear in the Area Primaries can be counted as one of the 3 modules towards satisfying a Focus Area. In this case, a student has to read just two other modules in the Area Primaries to satisfy the Focus Area. Elective modules are grouped into the Focus Areas as a guide for indicating their related areas of study. The following CS focus areas are applicable to new cohorts from AY2015-16 onwards: Algorithms & Theory Artificial Intelligence Computer Graphics and Games Computer Security Database Systems Multimedia Information Retrieval Networking and Distributed Systems Parallel Computing Programming Languages Software Engineering The following CS focus areas are applicable to cohorts admitted before AY2015-16: Algorithms & Theory Artificial Intelligence Computer Graphics and Games (new area) Computer Networks (renamed to Networking and Distributed Systems from AY2015-16) Computer Security Database Systems Information Retrieval (renamed to Multimedia Information Retrieval from AY2015-16) Interactive Media Parallel Computing Programming Languages Software Engineering Visual Computing Algorithms & Theory The theoretical foundations of computing.
