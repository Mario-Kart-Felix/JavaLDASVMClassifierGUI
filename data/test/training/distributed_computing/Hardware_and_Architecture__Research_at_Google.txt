The smallest part is your smartphone, a machine that is over ten times faster than the iconic Cray-1 supercomputer. The capabilities of these remarkable mobile devices are amplified by orders of magnitude through their connection to Web services running on building-sized computing systems that we call Warehouse-scale computers (WSCs). Googleâ€™s engineers and researchers have been pioneering both WSC and mobile hardware technology with the goal of providing Google programmers and our Cloud developers with a unique computing infrastructure in terms of scale, cost-efficiency, energy-efficiency, resiliency and speed. The tight collaboration among software, hardware, mechanical, electrical, environmental, thermal and civil engineers result in some of the most impressive and efficient computers in the world. 60 Publications       Topology and Control Innovation for Auxiliary Power Supply in Dimmable LED Drivers Liang Jia , Yan-Fei Liu IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics (2017) (to appear)       Disks for Data Centers Eric Brewer , Lawrence Ying , Lawrence Greenfield, Robert Cypher, Theodore T'so Google (2016), pp. 1-16       Flash reliability in the field: The expected and the unexpected Bianca Schroeder, Raghav Lagisetty, Arif Merchant Usenix FAST 2016       Invent More, Toil Less Betsy (Adrienne Elizabeth) Beyer , Brendan Gleason, Dave O'Connor, Vivek Rau :login;, vol. 41, issue 3 (2016), pp. 44-48       The 2015 Top Picks In Computer Architecture (Guest Editor's Introduction) Daniel J.
