There has been increased research interest in systems composed of multiple autonomous mobilerobots exhibiting cooperative behavior. Groups of mobile robots are constructed, with an aim to studyingsuch issues as group architecture, resource conflict, origin of cooperation, learning, and geometric problems. As yet, few applications of cooperative robotics have been reported, and supporting theory is still inits formative stages. In this paper, we give a critical survey of existing works and discuss open problemsin this field, emphasizing the various theoretical issues that arise in the study of cooperative robotics. Wedescribe the intellectual heritages that have guided early research, as well as possible additions to the setof existing motivations.Keywords cooperative robotics, swarm intelligence, distributed robotics, artificial intelligence, mobilerobots, multiagent systems1. PreliminariesThere has been much recent activity towardachieving systems of multiple mobile robots engaged in collective behavior. Such systems are ofinterest for several reasons tasks may be inherently too complex or impossible for a single robot to accomplish, orperformance benefits can be gained from usingmultiple robots building and using several simple robots can beeasier, cheaper, more flexible and more faulttolerant than having a single powerful robot foreach separate task and the constructive, synthetic approach inherentin cooperative mobile robotics can possibly This is an expanded version of a paper which originallyappeared in the proceedings of the 1995 IEEERSJ IROSconference.yield insights into fundamental problems in thesocial sciences organization theory, economics,cognitive psychology, and life sciences theoretical biology, animal ethology.The study of multiplerobot systems naturallyextends research on singlerobot systems, but isalso a discipline unto itself multiplerobot systems can accomplish tasks that no single robotcan accomplish, since ultimately a single robot, nomatter how capable, is spatially limited. Multiplerobot systems are also different from other distributed systems because of their implicit realworld environment, which is presumably moredifficult to model and reason about than traditional components of distributed system environments i.e., computers, databases, networks.The term collective behavior generically denotesany behavior of agents in a system having morethan one agent. Cooperative behavior, which is2 Cao, et al.the subject of the present survey, is a subclass ofcollective behavior that is characterized by cooperation. Websters dictionary 118 defines cooperate as to associate with another or others formutual, often economic, benefit. Explicit definitions of cooperation in the robotics literature,while surprisingly sparse, include1. joint collaborative behavior that is directedtoward some goal in which there is a commoninterest or reward 222. a form of interaction, usually based on communication 108 and3. joining together for doing something thatcreates a progressive result such as increasingperformance or saving time 137.These definitions show the wide range of possible motivating perspectives. For example, definitions such as 1 typically lead to the study oftask decomposition, task allocation, and other distributed artificial intelligence DAI issues e.g.,learning, rationality. Definitions along the linesof 2 reflect a concern with requirements for information or other resources, and may be accompanied by studies of related issues such as correctnessand faulttolerance. Finally, definition 3 reflectsa concern with quantified measures of cooperation, such as speedup in time to complete a task.Thus, in these definitions we see three fundamental seeds the task, the mechanism of cooperation,and system performance.We define cooperative behavior as followsGiven some task specified by a designer, amultiplerobot system displays cooperative behavior if, due to some underlying mechanism i.e., themechanism of cooperation, there is an increasein the total utility of the system. Intuitively, cooperative behavior entails some type of performancegain over naive collective behavior. The mechanism of cooperation may lie in the imposition bythe designer of a control or communication structure, in aspects of the task specification, in theinteraction dynamics of agent behaviors, etc.In this paper, we survey the intellectual heritage and major research directions of the fieldof cooperative robotics. For this survey of cooperative robotics to remain tractable, we restrictour discussion to works involving mobile robots orsimulations of mobile robots, where a mobile robotis taken to be an autonomous, physically independent, mobile robot. In particular, we concentratedon fundamental theoretical issues that impinge oncooperative robotics. Thus, the following relatedsubjects were outside the scope of this work coordination of multiple manipulators, articulated arms, or multifingered hands, etc. humanrobot cooperative systems, and userinterface issues that arise with multiplerobotsystems 184 8 124 1. the competitive subclass of collective behavior,which includes pursuitevasion 139, 120 andoneonone competitive games 12. Note that acooperative team strategy for, e.g., work on therobot soccer league recently started in Japan87 would lie within our present scope. emerging technologies such as nanotechnology 48 and Micro ElectroMechanical Systems117 that are likely to be very important to cooperative robotics are beyond the scope of thispaper.Even with these restrictions, we find that overthe past 8 years 19871995 alone, well over 200papers have been published in this field of cooperative mobile robotics, encompassing theoriesfrom such diverse disciplines as artificial intelligence, game theoryeconomics, theoretical biology, distributed computingcontrol, animal ethology and artificial life.We are aware of two previous works that havesurveyed or taxonomized the literature. 13 is abroad, relatively succinct survey whose scope encompasses distributed autonomous robotic systemsi.e., not restricted to mobile robots. 50 focuseson several wellknown swarm architectures e.g.,SWARM and Matarics Behaviorbased architecture  see Section 2.1 and proposes a taxonomyto characterize these architectures. The scope andintent of our work differs significantly from these,in that 1 we extensively survey the field of cooperative mobile robotics, and 2 we provide ataxonomical organization of the literature basedon problems and solutions that have arisen in thefield as opposed to a selected group of architectures. In addition, we survey much new materialthat has appeared since these earlier works werepublished.Cooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 3Towards a Picture of Cooperative RoboticsIn the mid1940s Grey Walter, along with Wienerand Shannon, studied turtlelike robots equippedwith light and touch sensors these simple robotsexhibited complex social behavior in responding to each others movements 46. Coordinationand interactions of multiple intelligent agents havebeen actively studied in the field of distributedartificial intelligence DAI since the early 1970s28, but the DAI field concerned itself mainlywith problems involving software agents. In thelate 1980s, the robotics research community became very active in cooperative robotics, beginning with projects such as CEBOT 59, SWARM25, ACTRESS 16, GOFER 35, and the workat Brussels 151. These early projects were doneprimarily in simulation, and, while the early workon CEBOT, ACTRESS and GOFER have all hadphysical implementations with  3 robots, insome sense these implementations were presentedby way of proving the simulation results. Thus,several more recent works cf. 91, 111, 131are significant for establishing an emphasis onthe actual physical implementation of cooperativerobotic systems. Many of the recent cooperativerobotic systems, in contrast to the earlier works,are based on a behaviorbased approach cf. 30.Various perspectives on autonomy and on the connection between intelligence and environment arestrongly associated with the behaviorbased approach 31, but are not intrinsic to multiplerobotsystems and thus lie beyond our present scope.Also note that a recent incarnation of CEBOT,which has been implemented on physical robots,is based on a behaviorbased control architecture34.The rapid progress of cooperative robotics sincethe late 1980s has been an interplay of systems,theories and problems to solve a given problem,systems are envisioned, simulated and built theories of cooperation are brought from other fieldsand new problems are identified prompting further systems and theories. Since so much of thisprogress is recent, it is not easy to discern deepintellectual heritages from within the field. Moreapparent are the intellectual heritages from otherfields, as well as the canonical task domains whichhave driven research. Three examples of the latterare Traffic Control. When multiple agents movewithin a common environment, they typicallyattempt to avoid collisions. Fundamentally,this may be viewed as a problem of resourceconflict, which may be resolved by introducing,e.g., traffic rules, priorities, or communicationarchitectures. From another perspective, pathplanning must be performed taking into consideration other robots and the global environment this multiplerobot path planning is anintrinsically geometric problem in configurationspacetime. Note that prioritization and communication protocols  as well as the internalmodeling of other robots  all reflect possiblevariants of the group architecture of the robots.For example, traffic rules are commonly used toreduce planning cost for avoiding collision anddeadlock in a realworld environment, such asa network of roads. Interestingly, behaviorbased approaches identify collision avoidanceas one of the most basic behaviors 30, andachieving a collisionavoidance behavior is thenatural solution to collision avoidance amongmultiple robots. However, in reported experiments that use the behaviorbased approach,robots are never restricted to road networks. BoxPushingCooperative Manipulation. Many works have addressed the boxpushing or couchpushing problem, for widelyvarying reasons. The focus in 134 is on taskallocation, faulttolerance and reinforcementlearning. By contrast, 45 studies two boxpushing protocols in terms of their intrinsiccommunication and hardware requirements,via the concept of information invariants. Cooperative manipulation of large objects is particularly interesting in that cooperation can beachieved without the robots even knowing ofeach others existence 147, 159. Other worksin the class of boxpushingobject manipulation include 175 153 82 33 91 94 92114 145 72 146. Foraging. In foraging, a group of robots mustpick up objects scattered in the environmentthis is evocative of toxic waste cleanup, harvesting, search and rescue, etc. The foraging taskis one of the canonical testbeds for cooperative4 Cao, et al.robotics 32 151 10 67 102 49 108 924. The task is interesting because 1 it canbe performed by each robot independently i.e.,the issue is whether multiple robots achieve aperformance gain, and 2 as discussed in Section 3.2, the task is also interesting due to motivations related to the biological inspirationsbehind cooperative robot systems. There aresome conceptual overlaps with the related taskof materials handling in a manufacturing workcell 47. A wide variety of techniques havebeen applied, ranging from simple stigmergyessentially random movements that result inthe fortuitous collection of objects 24 to morecomplex algorithms in which robots form chainsalong which objects are passed to the goal 49.24 defines stigmergy as the production of acertain behaviour in agents as a consequenceof the effects produced in the local environment by previous behaviour. This is actually aform of cooperation without communication,which has been the stated object of several foraging solutions since the corresponding formulations become nearly trivial if communicationis used. On the other hand, that stigmergy maynot satisfy our definition of cooperation givenabove, since there is no performance improvement over the naive algorithm  in this particular case, the proposed stigmergic algorithmis the naive algorithm. Again, group architecture and learning are major research themes inaddressing this problem.Other interesting task domains that have received attention in the literature include multirobot security systems 53, landmine detectionand clearance 54, robotic structural support systems i.e., keeping structures stable in case of, say,an earthquake 107, map making 149, and assembly of objects using multiple robots 175.Organization of PaperWith respect to our above definition of cooperative behavior, we find that the great majority ofthe cooperative robotics literature centers on themechanism of cooperation i.e., few works studya task without also claiming some novel approachto achieving cooperation. Thus, our study hasled to the synthesis of five Research Axes whichwe believe comprise the major themes of investigation to date into the underlying mechanism ofcooperation.Section 2 of this paper describes these axes,which are 2.1 Group Architecture, 2.2 ResourceConflict, 2.3 Origin of Cooperation, 2.4 Learning, and 2.5 Geometric Problems. In Section 3,we present more synthetic reviews of cooperativerobotics Section 3.1 discusses constraints arising from technological limitations and Section 3.2discusses possible lacunae in existing work e.g.,formalisms for measuring performance of a cooperative robot system, then reviews three fieldswhich we believe must strongly influence futurework. We conclude in Section 4 with a list of keyresearch challenges facing the field.2. Research AxesSeeking a mechanism of cooperation may berephrased as the cooperative behavior designproblem Given a group of robots, an environment, and a task, how should cooperative behaviorarise In some sense, every work in cooperativerobotics has addressed facets of this problem, andthe major research axes of the field follow fromelements of this problem. Note that certain basicrobot interactions are not taskperforming interactions per se, but are rather basic primitives uponwhich taskperforming interactions can be built,e.g., following 39, 45 and many others or flocking 140, 108. It might be argued that these interactions entail control and coordination tasksrather than cooperation tasks, but our treatment does not make such a distinction.First, the realization of cooperative behaviormust rely on some infrastructure, the group architecture. This encompasses such concepts asrobot heterogeneityhomogeneity, the ability of agiven robot to recognize and model other robots,and communication structure. Second, for multiple robots to inhabit a shared environment, manipulate objects in the environment, and possibly communicate with each other, a mechanismis needed to resolve resource conflicts. Thethird research axis, origins of cooperation,refers to how cooperative behavior is actually motivated and achieved. Here, we do not discussCooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 5instances where cooperation has been explicitlyengineered into the robots behavior since thisis the default approach. Instead, we are moreinterested in biological parallels e.g., to socialinsect behavior, gametheoretic justifications forcooperation, and concepts of emergence. Becauseadaptability and flexibility are essential traits ina tasksolving group of robots, we view learningas a fourth key to achieving cooperative behavior.One important mechanism in generating cooperation, namely, task decomposition and allocation,is not considered a research axis since i veryfew works in cooperative robotics have centeredon task decomposition and allocation with thenotable exceptions of 126, 106, 134, ii cooperative robot tasks foraging, boxpushing in theliterature are simple enough that decompositionand allocation are not required in the solution,and iii the use of decomposition and allocationdepends almost entirely on the group architecturese.g. whether it is centralized or decentralized.Note that there is also a related, geometric problem of optimizing the allocation of tasks spatially.This has been recently studied in the context ofthe division of the search of a work area by multiple robots 97. Whereas the first four axes arerelated to the generation of cooperative behavior,our fifth and final axis  geometric problems covers research issues that are tied to the embedding of robot tasks in a two or threedimensionalworld. These issues include multiagent path planning, moving to formation, and pattern generation.2.1. Group ArchitectureThe architecture of a computing system has beendefined as the part of the system that remainsunchanged unless an external agent changes it165. The group architecture of a cooperativerobotic system provides the infrastructure uponwhich collective behaviors are implemented, anddetermines the capabilities and limitations of thesystem. We now briefly discuss some of the key architectural features of a group architecture for mobile robots centralizationdecentralization, differentiation, communications, and the ability tomodel other agents. We then describe several representative systems that have addressed these specific problems.CentralizationDecentralization The mostfundamental decision that is made when defininga group architecture is whether the system is centralized or decentralized, and if it is decentralized,whether the system is hierarchical or distributed.Centralized architectures are characterized by asingle control agent. Decentralized architectureslack such an agent. There are two types of decentralized architectures distributed architectures inwhich all agents are equal with respect to control,and hierarchical architectures which are locallycentralized. Currently, the dominant paradigm isthe decentralized approach.The behavior of decentralized systems is often described using such terms as emergenceand selforganization. It is widely claimed thatdecentralized architectures e.g., 24, 10, 152,108 have several inherent advantages over centralized architectures, including fault tolerance,natural exploitation of parallelism, reliability, andscalability. However, we are not aware of anypublished empirical or theoretical comparison thatsupports these claims directly. Such a comparison would be interesting, particularly in scenarios where the team of robots is relatively smalle.g., two robots pushing a box, and it is notclear whether the scaling properties of decentralization offset the coordinative advantage of centralized systems.In practice, many systems do not conform toa strict centralizeddecentralized dichotomy, e.g.,many largely decentralized architectures utilizeleader agents. We are not aware of any instances of systems that are completely centralized, although there are some hybrid centralizeddecentralized architectures wherein there is acentral planner that exerts highlevel control overmostly autonomous agents 126, 106, 3, 36.Differentiation We define a group of robots tobe homogeneous if the capabilities of the individual robots are identical, and heterogeneous otherwise. In general, heterogeneity introduces complexity since task allocation becomes more difficult, and agents have a greater need to modelother individuals in the group. 134 has intro6 Cao, et al.duced the concept of task coverage, which measures the ability of a given team member toachieve a given task. This parameter is an index ofthe demand for cooperation when task coverageis high, tasks can be accomplished without muchcooperation, but otherwise, cooperation is necessary. Task coverage is maximal in homogeneousgroups, and decreases as groups become more heterogeneous i.e., in the limit only one agent in thegroup can perform any given task.The literature is currently dominated by worksthat assume homogeneous groups of robots. However, some notable architectures can handle heterogeneity, e.g., ACTRESS and ALLIANCE seeSection 2.1 below. In heterogeneous groups, taskallocation may be determined by individual capabilities, but in homogeneous systems, agents mayneed to differentiate into distinct roles that are either known at designtime, or arise dynamicallyat runtime.Communication Structures The communication structure of a group determines the possiblemodes of interagent interaction. We characterizethree major types of interactions that can be supported. 50 proposes a more detailed taxonomyof communication structures.Interaction via environmentThe simplest, most limited type of interactionoccurs when the environment itself is the communication medium in effect, a shared memory,and there is no explicit communication or interaction between agents. This modality has also beencalled cooperation without communication bysome researchers. Systems that depend on thisform of interaction include 67, 24, 10, 151,159, 160, 147.Interaction via sensingCorresponding to armslength relationships inorganization theory 75, interaction via sensingrefers to local interactions that occur betweenagents as a result of agents sensing one another,but without explicit communication. This type ofinteraction requires the ability of agents to distinguish between other agents in the group and otherobjects in the environment, which is called kinrecognition in some literatures 108. Interactionvia sensing is indispensable for modeling of otheragents see Section 2.1.4 below. Because of hardware limitations, interaction via sensing has oftenbeen emulated using radio or infrared communications. However, several recent works attempt toimplement true interaction via sensing, based onvision 95, 96, 154. Collective behaviors thatcan use this kind of interaction include flockingand pattern formation keeping in formation withnearest neighbors.Interaction via communicationsThe third form of interaction involves explicitcommunication with other agents, by either directed or broadcast intentional messages i.e. therecipients of the message may be either known orunknown. Because architectures that enable thisform of communication are similar to communication networks, many standard issues from the fieldof networks arise, including the design of networktopologies and communications protocols. For example, in 168 a media access protocol similarto that of Ethernet is used for interrobot communication. In 78, robots with limited communication range communicate to each other usingthe hellocall protocol, by which they establishchains in order to extend their effective communication ranges. 61 describes methods for communicating to many zillions robots, includinga variety of schemes ranging from broadcast channels where a message is sent to all other robots inthe system to modulated retroreflection wherea master sends out a laser signal to slaves andinterprets the response by the nature of the reflection. 174 describes and simulates a wirelessCSMACD  Carrier Sense Multiple Access withCollision Detection  protocol for the distributedrobotic systems.There are also communication mechanisms designed specially for multiplerobot systems. Forexample, 171 proposes the signboard as acommunication mechanism for distributed roboticsystems. 7 gives a communication protocol modeled after diffusion, wherein local communicationsimilar to chemical communication mechanisms inanimals is used. The communication is engineeredto decay away at a preset rate. Similar communications mechanisms are studied in 102, 49, 67.Additional work on communication can be foundin 185, which analyzes optimal group sizes forCooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 7local communications and communication delays.In a related vein, 186, 187 analyzes optimal local communication ranges in broadcast communication.Modeling of Other Agents Modeling the intentions, beliefs, actions, capabilities, and statesof other agents can lead to more effective cooperation between robots. Communications requirements can also be lowered if each agent has thecapability to model other agents. Note that themodeling of other agents entails more than implicit communication via the environment or perception modeling requires that the modeler hassome representation of another agent, and thatthis representation can be used to make inferencesabout the actions of the other agent.In cooperative robotics, agent modeling hasbeen explored most extensively in the context ofmanipulating a large object. Many solutions haveexploited the fact that the object can serve as acommon medium by which the agents can modeleach other.The second of two boxpushing protocols in45 can achieve cooperation without communication since the object being manipulated alsofunctions as a communication channel that isshared by the robot agents other works capitalize on the same concept to derive distributedcontrol laws which rely only on local measures offorce, torque, orientation, or distance, i.e., no explicit communication is necessary cf. 153 73.In a tworobot bar carrying task, Fukuda andSekiyamas agents 60 each uses a probabilisticmodel of the other agent. When a risk threshold isexceeded, an agent communicates with its partnerto maintain coordination. In 43, 44, the theoryof information invariants is used to show that extra hardware capabilities can be added in order toinfer the actions of the other agent, thus reducingcommunication requirements. This is in contrastto 147, where the robots achieve box pushing butare not aware of each other at all. For a more complex task involving the placement of five desks in154, a homogeneous group of four robots share aceiling camera to get positional information, butdo not communicate with each other. Each robotrelies on modeling of other agents to detect conflicts of paths and placements of desks, and tochange plans accordingly.Representative Architectures All systemsimplement some group architecture. We now describe several particularly welldefined representative architectures, along with works done withineach of their frameworks. It is interesting tonote that these architectures encompass the entirespectrum from traditional AI to highly decentralized approaches.CEBOTCEBOT CEllular roBOTics System is a decentralized, hierarchical architecture inspired bythe cellular organization of biological entities cf.59 57, 162 161 56. The system is dynamically reconfigurable in that basic autonomouscells robots, which can be physically coupledto other cells, dynamically reconfigure their structure to an optimal configuration in response tochanging environments. In the CEBOT hierarchythere are master cells that coordinate subtasksand communicate with other master cells. A solution to the problem of electing these master cellswas discussed in 164. Formation of structuredcellular modules from a population of initially separated cells was studied in 162. Communicationsrequirements have been studied extensively withrespect to the CEBOT architecture, and variousmethods have been proposed that seek to reducecommunication requirements by making individual cells more intelligent e.g., enabling them tomodel the behavior of other cells. 60 studies theproblem of modeling the behavior of other cells,while 85, 86 present a control method that calculates the goal of a cell based on its previous goaland on its masters goal. 58 gives a means of estimating the amount of information exchanged between cells, and 163 gives a heuristic for findingmaster cells for a binary communication tree. Anew behavior selection mechanism is introducedin 34, based on two matrices, the priority matrix and the interest relation matrix, with a learning algorithm used to adjust the priority matrix.Recently, a Micro Autonomous Robotic SystemMARS has been built consisting of robots of 20cubic mm and equipped with infrared communications 121.8 Cao, et al.ACTRESSThe ACTRESS ACTorbased Robot andEquipments Synthetic System project 16, 80,15 is inspired by the Universal Modular ACTOR Formalism 76. In the ACTRESS system,robotors, including 3 robots and 3 workstationsone as interface to human operator, one as image processor and one as global environment manager, form a heterogeneous group trying to perform tasks such as object pushing 14 that cannotbe accomplished by any of the individual robotorsalone 79, 156. Communication protocols at different abstraction levels 115 provide a meansupon which group cast and negotiation mechanisms based on Contract Net 150 and multistagenegotiation protocols are built 18. Various issues are studied, such as efficient communicationsbetween robots and environment managers 17,collision avoidance 19.SWARMA SWARM is a distributed system with a largenumber of autonomous robots 81. Note thatthe work on SWARM systems began as work onCellular Robotic Systems 25, where many simpleagents occupied one or twodimensional environments and were able to perform tasks such as pattern generation and selforganization. SWARMintelligence is a property of systems of nonintelligent robots exhibiting collectively intelligentbehavior 69. Selforganization in a SWARMis the ability to distribute itself optimally fora given task, e.g., via geometric pattern formation or structural organization. SWARM exhibitsa distributed architecture, usually with no differentiation among members an exception is 70,where two different types of robots were used.Interaction takes place by each cell reacting tothe state of its nearest neighbors. Mechanismsfor selforganization in SWARM are studied in70 27 26 69 103 81. Examples for possible applications include largescale displays anddistributed sensing 71. Communication primitives have been an important part of research inSWARM 170, 173 see Section 3.2 below formore details.GOFERThe GOFER architecture 35, 100 was usedto study distributed problem solving by multiplemobile robots in an indoor environment using traditional AI techniques. In GOFER, a central taskplanning and scheduling system CTPS communicates with all robots and has a global view ofboth the tasks to be performed and the availabilityof robots to perform the tasks. The CTPS generates a plan structure template for an instance of aplan and informs all available robots of the pending goals and plan structures. Robots use a taskallocation algorithm like the Contract Net Protocol 150 to determine their roles. Given the goalsassigned during the task allocation process, theyattempt to achieve their goals using fairly standard AI planning techniques. The GOFER architecture was successfully used with three physicalrobots for tasks such as following, boxpushing,and wall tracking in a corridor.Other architectures that make significant use ofconcepts studied within the classical distributedparadigm are described in 106 123 126 127125 4 5.ALLIANCELALLIANCEThe ALLIANCE architecture was developed byParker 134, 133 in order to study cooperationin a heterogeneous, smalltomediumsized teamof largely independent, loosely coupled robots.Robots are assumed able to, with some probability, sense the effects of their own actions andthe actions of other agents through perceptionand explicit broadcast communications. Individual robots are based on a behaviorbased controller with an extension for activating behaviorsets that accomplish certain tasks. These sets areactivated by motivational behaviors whose activations are in turn determined by the robots awareness of their teammates. LALLIANCE 134 isan extension to ALLIANCE that uses reinforcement learning to adjust the parameters controlling behavior set activation. The ALLIANCELALLIANCE architecture has been implementedboth on real robots and in simulation, and hasbeen successfully demonstrated for tasks includingboxpushing, puckgathering, marching in formation, and simulations of hazardous waste cleanupand janitorial service.BehaviorBased Cooperative BehaviorCooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 9Mataric 112, 110, 113, 108 proposes abehaviorbased architecture for the synthesis ofcollective behaviors such as flocking, foraging,and docking based on the direct and temporalcomposition of primitive basic behaviors safewandering, following, aggregation, dispersion,homing. A method for automatically constructing composite behaviors based on reinforcementlearning is also proposed. The architecture hasbeen implemented both on groups of up to 20 realrobots the largest group reported in the works wesurveyed and in simulation.Similar behaviorbased architectures includethe work by Kube et al, which is based onan Adaptive Logic Network, a neural network91, 92, 94, 93, the TropismBased CognitiveArchitecture 2, and an architecture based on instinctive behaviors 40.2.2. Resource ConflictWhen a single indivisible resource is requestedby multiple robots, resource conflict arises. Thisissue has been studied in many guises, notablythe mutual exclusion problem in distributed algorithms and the multiaccess problem in computernetworks. With multiple robots, resource conflictoccurs when there is a need to share space, manipulable objects or communication media. Fewworks have dealt specifically with object sharingor sharing of communication media i.e., sharingof communication media is usually achieved usingvery basic techniques  wireless LAN, straightforward timedivision multiplexing, or broadcast overan RF channel recently, 172, 187, 186 haveconsidered some problems in sharing communications channels. We therefore center on the spacesharing problem, which has been studied primarily via multiplerobot path planning the trafficcontrol formulation from above and the collisionand deadlock avoidance problems.In a multirobot system, each robot can conceivably plan a path that accounts for otherrobots and the global environment via configuration spacetime, explicit models of other agents,or other techniques For example, 60 proposesa hierarchical prediction model which essentially uses simulation to achieve collision avoidance. 144 considers the problem of crossing anintersection event transforms into the local spacetime coordinate frame of a robot are applied, andeach robot i iteratively updates the local frameand its objects, ii evaluates collision risk, andiii generates a modified path depending on thecollision risk. See also Section 2.5. However, researchers considering realworld multirobot systems typically conclude that planning paths inadvance is impossible. Thus, robots are often restricted to prescribed paths or roads, with rulesmuch like traffic laws in the human world andcommunications used to avoid collision and deadlock 35, 14.Grossman 68 classifies instances of the traffic control problem into three types i restrictedroads, ii multiple possible roads with robots selecting autonomously between them, and iii multiple possible roads with centralized traffic control.When individual robots possess unique roads fromone point to another, no conflict is possible whenthere is global knowledge and centralized control,it is easy to prevent conflict. Thus, the interesting case is ii, where robots are allowed to autonomously select roads. Analysis in 68 showsthat restricted roads are highly suboptimal, andthat the autonomous road choice coupled with agreedy policy for escaping blocked situations is farmore effective cf. modest cooperation 137,where robots are assumed to be benevolent for thecommon good of the system.Solutions to the traffic control problem rangefrom rulebased solutions to approaches with antecedents in distributed processing. In 84, robotsfollow preplanned paths and use rules for collisionavoidance. Example rules include keepright,stop at intersection, and keep sufficient spaceto the robot in front of you. 19 solves collisionavoidance using two simple rules and a communication protocol that resolves conflict by transmitting individual priorities based on the task requirement, the environment, and the robot performance. In 188, the robots stop at an intersection and indicate both the number of robots at theintersection and the directions in which they aretraveling. If deadlock is possible, each robot performs shunting trying to obtain high priorityand proceeds according to the agreedupon priorities. 166 takes a distributed computing approach10 Cao, et al.to traffic control, where the particular problemsolved is to keep the number of robots traveling onany given path below a threshold value. Robotsuse a mutual exclusion protocol to compete forthe right to travel on each path. Wang and Beni171 adapt two distributed algorithms to solvetwo problems in their CRSSWARM architecture.The nway intersection problem is solved usingan algorithm similar to mutual exclusion, and theknot detection problem is solved using an algorithm similar to distributed deadlock detection.2.3. The Origin of CooperationIn almost all of the work in collective robotics sofar, it has been assumed that cooperation is explicitly designed into the system. An interestingresearch problem is to study how cooperation canarise without explicit human motivation amongpossibly selfish agents.McFarland 116 distinguishes between two significantly different types of group behaviors thatare found in nature eusocial behavior and cooperative behavior. Eusocial behavior is found in manyinsect species e.g., colonies of ants or bees, andis the result of genetically determined individualbehavior. In eusocial societies, individual agentsare not very capable, but seemingly intelligent behavior arises out of their interactions. This cooperative behavior is necessary for the survival ofthe individuals in the colonies. 177 studies theevolution of herding behavior in prey agents in asimulated ecology, where there is no a priori drivefor cooperation. Recently, 116, 152 have laidthe initial groundwork to address the problem ofemergent cooperation in an ecological system inhabited by actual mobile robots. In their ecosystem, individual robots are selfish, utilitydrivenagents that must cooperate in order to survivei.e., maintain some minimal energy level.On the other hand, 116 defines cooperativebehavior as the social behavior observed in higheranimals vertebrates i.e., cooperation is the result of interactions between selfish agents. Unlikeeusocial behavior, cooperative behavior is not motivated by innate behavior, but by an intentionaldesire to cooperate in order to maximize individual utility.Inspired by economics and gametheoretic approaches, 28 62 142 143 and others have studied the emergence of cooperation in selfish rationalagents in the field of distributed artificial intelligence DAI. A recent work in the robotics literature that adopts this gametheoretic approach is128.2.4. LearningFinding the correct values for control parameters that lead to a desired cooperative behaviorcan be a difficult, timeconsuming task for a human designer. Therefore, it is highly desirable formultiplerobot systems to be able to learn controlparameter values in order to optimize their taskperformance, and to adapt to changes in the environment. Reinforcement learning 23, 83 hasoften been used in cooperative robotics.Mataric 109, 108 proposes a reformulation ofthe reinforcement learning paradigm using higherlevels of abstraction conditions, behaviors, andheterogeneous reward functions and progress estimators instead of states, actions, and reinforcement to enable robots to learn a composite foraging behavior. 134 uses standard reinforcementalgorithms to improve the performance of cooperating agents in the LALLIANCE architectureby having the agents learn how to better estimatethe performance of other agents. 147 uses reinforcement learning in a tworobot boxpushingsystem, and 181 applies reinforcement learningto learn a simple, artificial robot language. Otherrelevant works in multiagent reinforcement learning done in simulation, in contrast to the aboveworks which were implemented on actual robotsinclude 178, 157, 105.In addition, techniques inspired by biological evolution have also been used in cooperativerobotics. 177 uses a genetic algorithm 66 toevolve neural network controllers for simulatedprey creatures that learn a herding behavior tohelp avoid predators. 138 uses genetic programming 90 to evolve flocking behavior in simulatedboids.Cooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 112.5. Geometric ProblemsBecause mobile robots can move about in thephysical world and must interact with each otherphysically, geometric problems are inherent tomultiplerobot systems. This is a fundamentalproperty that distinguishes multiplerobot systems from traditional distributed computer systems in which individual nodes are stationary. Geometric problems that have been studied in thecooperative robotics literature include multiplerobot path planning, moving to and maintainingformation, and pattern generation.MultipleRobot Path Planning Recallthat multiplerobot path planning requires agentsto plan routes that do not intersect. This is acase of resource conflict, since the agents and theirgoals are embedded in a finite amount of space.However, we note path planning separately because of its intrinsic geometric flavor as well as itshistorical importance in the literature.Detailed reviews of path planning are found in55, 99, 6. Fujimura 55 views path planning aseither centralized with a universal pathplannermaking decisions or distributed with individualagents planning and adjusting their paths. Araiand Ota 6 make a similar distinction in the nature of the planner, and also allow hybrid systems that can be combinations of online, offline,centralized, or decentralized. Latombe 99 givesa somewhat different taxonomy his centralizedplanning is planning that takes into account allrobots, while decoupled planning entails planning the path of each robot independently. Forcentralized planning, several methods originallyused for singlerobot systems can be applied. Fordecoupled planning, two approaches are given iprioritized planning considers one robot at a timeaccording to a global priority, while ii the pathcoordination method essentially plans paths byscheduling the configuration spacetime resource.The work of 52 is a typical decoupled approachwhere every robot is prioritized and robots planglobal paths with respect to only higherpriorityrobots e.g., the highestpriority robot plans onlyaround the obstacles in the environment. Notethat this is still a centralized method accordingto the terminology of 55, 6. On the otherhand, 183 presents a distributed approach perFujimuras taxonomy where each robot initiallyattempts a straightline path to the goal if an interfering obstacle is seen, then the robot will scanthe visible vertices of the obstacle and move toward the closest one. In general, this continuesuntil the goal is reached. Dynamically varyingpriorities are given to each robot based on current need to resolve path intersection conflicts,and conflicting robots can either negotiate amongthemselves or allow a global blackboard managerto perform this function.Some recent works have addressed some nontraditional motion planning problems. For example, 74 proposes an algorithm for path planningin tethered robots, and 129 consider the problemof moving while grasping large objects.The Formation and Marching ProblemsThe Formation and Marching problems respectively require multiple robots to form up and movein a specified pattern. Solving these problemsis quite interesting in terms of distributed algorithms 155, balancing between global and localknowledge 134, and intrinsic information requirements for a given task. Solutions to Formationand Marching are also useful primitives for largertasks, e.g., moving a large object by a group ofrobots 153 37 38 or distributed sensing 170.The Formation problem seems very difficult,e.g., no published work has yet given a distributed circleforming algorithm that guarantees the robots will actually end up in a circle.For this problem, the best known solution is thedistributed algorithm of 155, which guaranteesonly that the robots will end up in a shape ofconstant diameter e.g., a Reuleaux triangle canbe the result. It is assumed that the ith mobilerobot knows the distances Di and di to its farthestand nearest neighbors, respectively the algorithmattempts to match the ratios Didi to a prescribedconstant. No method of detecting termination wasgiven. 37, 38 extend the method of 155 to incorporate collision avoidance when the robots aremoving. 180 approaches the shapegenerationproblem using systems of linear equations starting at some initial location, each robot changesits x, y position according to a linear functionof its neighbors positions and some fixed con12 Cao, et al.stant. Simulations of the method show that agroup of initially collinear robots will convergeinto the shape of an arc.We observe that the circleforming problem,while quite simple to state, reveals several pitfalls in formulating distributed geometric tasks.For example, the ability of an individual agent tosense attributes of the formation must be carefully considered too much information makes theproblem trivial, but too little information e.g.,returns from localized sensors may prevent a solution e.g., robots may never find each other.Information lower bounds, e.g., for robots to beable to realize that they have achieved the prescribed formation, are also largely unexplored inthe literature. Interestingly, we note that the algorithm of 155 can be slightly modified ratherthan each robot seeking to achieve a prescribedratio Dd, each robot could seek to achieve a prescribed angle close to 90 degrees subtended byits farthest neighbor and its closest neighbor to theright. This uses very similar sensing capabilitiesbut guarantees the desired circular shape.For Marching, 37 employs positional constraint conditions in a group of robots that makesturns while maintaining an array pattern. In 38a leaderfollower approach is used to solve a similar task. 132 studies the problem of keepingfour marching robots in a sidebyside formationthis increases in difficulty when the leader has toperform obstacle avoidance or other maneuvers.Parker also defines the concepts of global goalsand globallocal knowledge. To study the effectsof different distributions of global goals and globalknowledge, four strategies are compared both insimulation and on mobile robots. Simplified instances of the Marching problem require robotsto reliably follow each other and to move in agroup without tight constraints on their relativepositions. Some works that address this problem sometimes referred to as the herdingflockingproblem include 140, 108, 77, 29, 119. Asomewhat related problem is the problem of cooperative positioning determining the locations ofthe robots in a group using limited information98.Related to the Formation problem is the pattern generation problem in Cellular Robotic Systems, multiplerobot systems which can encodeinformation as patterns of its own structuralunits 25. Typically, one or twodimensionalgrids constitute the workspace, and sensing ofneighboring cells is the only input. Within theseconstraints, a set of rules is devised and appliedto all agents a standard result is to show in simulation that convergence to some spatial pattern isguaranteed. The meaningful aspect of this worklies in providing a system with the capability ofspatial selforganization a CRS will reconfigureitself without intervention in certain situations orunder certain conditions.In 170, 103, a CRS is characterized as anarbitrary number of robots in a one or twodimensional grid. The robots are able to senseneighboring cells and communicate with otherrobots via a signboard mechanism. Protocols arepresented for creating different patterns, e.g., alternating robots and spaces in a onedimensionalgrid covering the top row of a twodimensionalgrid by robots or covering the boundary of a twodimensional grid by robots. Egecioglu and Zimmermann 51 pose the Random Pairing problem, and seek a set of rules by which for anygiven number, a CRS will converge to a pattern such that there is a group of two robotswith that number of vacant spaces between themsee also 26. An analogous cellular approach isadopted by Genovese et al. 63, who describe thesimulation of a system of pollutantseeking mobile robots. The simulation uses a potential fieldmechanism to attract robots to the pollutant andto repulse robots from each other. The combinedeffect of these two forces yields a gradient patternthat points toward the source of the pollutant.3. PerspectivesAs an integrative engineering discipline, roboticshas always had to confront technological constraints that limit the domains that can be studied. Cooperative robotics has been subject tothese same constraints, but the constraints tend tobe more severe because of the need to cope withmultiple robots. At the same time, cooperativerobotics is a highly interdisciplinary field that offers the opportunity to draw influences from manyother domains. In this section, we first outlinesome of the technological constraints that face theCooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 13field. We then mention some directions in whichcooperative robotics might progress, and describerelated fields that have provided and will continueto provide influences.3.1. Technological ConstraintsIt is clear that technological constraints have limited the scope of implementations and task domains attempted in multiplerobot research systems.One obvious problem that arises is the generalproblem of researchers having to solve various instances of the vision problem before being able tomake progress on higherlevel problems. Often,difficulties arising from having to solve difficultperceptual problems can limit the range of tasksthat can be implemented on a multiplerobot platform. For example, in cooperative robotics systems where modeling of other agents see Section2.1 is used, the lack of an effective sensor arraycan render the system unimplementable in practice. In addition, robot hardware is also notoriously unreliable as a result, it is extremely difficult to maintain a fleet of robots in working condition. Again, collective robotics must deal withall of the hardware problems of singlerobotic systems, exacerbated by the multiplicity of agents.Due to the difficulties such as those outlined above encountered when working with realrobots, much of collective robotics has been studied exclusively in simulation. Some researchershave argued cf. 31 that by ignoring most of thedifficulties associated with perception and actuation, simulations ignore the most difficult problems of robotics. By making overly simplisticassumptions, it is possible to generate successful systems in simulation that would be infeasible in the real world. Conversely, mobile researchrobots can also come to look like the simulator,i.e., circular footprint, sonar ring, synchrodriveis a common configuration. Nevertheless, simulation must inevitably play a role in multiagentrobotics at some level. Although it is currentlypossible for researchers to study groups of 1020robots, it is unlikely that truly largescale collective behavior involving hundreds or thousands ofreal robots will be feasible at any time in thenear future. Thus, cooperative mobile robot researchers have used a variety of techniques to simulate perception, while using physical robots. Forinstance, the use of a global positioning systemcan in part compensate for the lack of vision, butcan place severe environmental constraints underwhich robots can operate because many objectsand acoustic features of the environment can interfere with the GPS. For the basic problem ofdifferentiating between other agents and all otherobjects in the environment. some researchers 134use radio communication to solve this problem. Inother works 43, 134 interaction via sensing isdone by explicit radio communication. There arerecent attempts to perform recognition via vision95, 96.An approach taken by some researchers is touse simulations as prototypes for largerscale studies, and small numbers of real robots as a proofofconcept demonstration 108, 134. On the otherhand, some researchers, citing the necessity ofworking in the real world domain, have chosento eschew simulations altogether and implementtheir theories directly on actual robots 24 116152. In studies of locomotion in large herds ofupto 100 onelegged robots and simulated human cyclists, 77 29 take an alternate approachof design a very physically realistic simulation.While this approach brings realism to actuation,the issue of perception is still simulated away it isstill unclear whether it will be feasible to realistically model sophisticated agents in more complexenvironments, or whether the effort will outweighthe benefits.3.2. Towards a Science of Cooperative RoboticsThe field of cooperative mobile robotics offers anincredibly rich application domain, integrating ahuge number of distinct fields from the social sciences, life sciences, and engineering. That somany theories have been brought to bear on cooperative robotics clearly shows the energy andthe allure of the field. Yet, cooperative robotics isstill an emerging field, and many open directionsremain. In this subsection, we point out somepromising directions that have yet to be fully explored by the research community. By way of apreface, we also point out three cultural changeswhich may come as the field matures 1 Because14 Cao, et al.of the youth of the field, cooperative robotics research has been necessarily rather informal andconcept oriented. However, the development ofrigorous formalisms is desirable to clarify variousassumptions about the systems being discussed,and to obtain a more precise language for discussion of elusive concepts such as cooperationthere are some exceptions, such as 134, whichpresents a formalization of motivational behaviorin the ALLIANCE architecture. 2 Formal metrics for cooperation and system performance, aswell as for grades of cooperation, are noticeablymissing from the literature. While the notion ofcooperation is difficult to formalize, such metricswill be very useful in characterizing various systems, and would improve our understanding ofthe nature of agent interactions. Although 108has suggested parameters such as agent densityfor estimating interference in a multirobot system, much more work in this area is necessary.3 Experimental studies might become more rigorous and thorough, e.g., via standard benchmarkproblems and algorithms. This is challenging inmobile robotics, given the noisy, systemspecificnature of the field. Nevertheless, it is necessary forclaims about robustness and nearoptimalityto be appropriately quantified, and for dependencies on various control parameters to be betterunderstood. For example, we have noted that despite a number of claims that various decentralizedapproaches are superior to centralized approaches,we have not seen any thorough, published experimental comparisons between the major competingparadigms on a particular task. However, we notethat recently, researchers have begun to empirically study quantitative measures of cooperation,trying to identify conditions under which mechanisms for cooperation are beneficial 11, 9, 135.Finally, several basic analogies remain incomplete, and must be revisited and resynthesized asthe field matures. For instance, many multirobotproblems are canonical for distributed computation and are interesting primarily when viewedin this light. A typical example is moving to formation, which has been solved optimally in thecomputational geometry literature it is the geometric matching under isometry problem 136,but which is difficult in the distributed contextdue to issues like synchronization, faulttolerance,leader election, etc. However, the distributed context can be selectively ignored, e.g., 155 use human intervention to perform what is essentiallyleader election breaking symmetry in a circle ofrobots to choose vertices of the desired polygonalformation. The introduction of such devices runscounter to the implicit assumption that it is thedistributed problem that holds research interest.More generally, it is likely that more structuraland less superficial analogies with other disciplineswill be needed in order to obtain principled theories of cooperation among mobile robots integration of formalisms and methodologies developed in these more mature disciplines is likely tobe an important step in the development of cooperative robotics. Disciplines most critical to thegrowth of cooperative robotics are distributedartificial intelligence, biology, and distributed systems.Distributed Artificial IntelligenceThe field of distributed artificial intelligenceDAI concerns itself with the study of distributedsystems of intelligent agents. As such, this field ishighly relevant to cooperative robotics. Bond andGasser 28 define DAI as the subfield of artificial intelligence AI concerned with concurrencyin AI computations, at many levels. Groundedin traditional symbolic AI and the social sciences,DAI is composed of two major areas of study Distributed Problem Solving DPS and MultiagentSystems MAS.Research in DPS is concerned with the issueof solving a single problem using many agents.Agents can cooperate by independently solvingsubproblems tasksharing, and by periodicallycommunicating partial solutions to each otherresultsharing. DPS involves three possiblyoverlapping phases i problem decompositiontask allocation, ii subproblem solution, andiii solution synthesis. Of these, problem decomposition has attracted the greatest interest amongDAI researchers. The critical issue in task sharing is finding the appropriate agent to assign to asubproblem. This is nontrivial, since if the mostappropriate agent for a subtask is not obvious,then the system must try to determine which ofthe many eligible agents should be assigned thetask, and often there are too many eligible agentsto attempt an exhaustive search. Perhaps theCooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 15best known scheme for task allocation is the Contract Net Protocol 150, which has been used inthe ACTRESS 79, 18, 130 and GOFER 35projects.One important assumption in DPS is that theagents are predisposed to cooperate. Researchin DPS is thus concerned with developing frameworks for cooperative behavior between willingagents, rather than developing frameworks to enforce cooperation between potentially incompatible agents, as is the case with multiagent systemsand distributed processing.Multiagent Systems MAS research is thestudy of the collective behavior of a group ofpossibly heterogeneous agents with potentiallyconflicting goals. In other words, researchersin MAS discard the benevolent agent assumption of DPS 62. 62 states the central problem of MAS research as follows in a world inwhich we get to design only our own intelligentagent, how should it interact with other intelligent agents Therefore, areas of interest in MASresearch include gametheoretic analysis of multiagent interactions cf. 62, 142, 143, reasoningabout other agents goals, beliefs, and actions cf.141, 64, 65, and analysis of the complexity ofsocial interactions 148.Work in MAS has tended to be theoretical andin very abstract domains. A common underlyingassumption is that although the agents may beselfish, they are rational and highly deliberative.This is in stark contrast with research in swarmintelligence see Section 2.5, in which individualagents are assumed to be relatively unintelligent.However, the influence of DAI on cooperativerobotics has been limited. This is in part becauseresearchers in DAI have mostly concentrated ondomains where uncertainty is not as much of anissue as it is in the physical world. Work inMAS has tended to be theoretical and in veryabstract domains where perfect sensing is usuallyassumed typical DPS domains are in disembodied, knowledgebased systems. Another assumption of DAI that has prevented its application incooperative robotics is the assumption is that although agents may be selfish, they are rationaland highly deliberative. However, achieving strictcriteria of rationality and deliberativeness can often be prohibitively expensive in current roboticsystems. Thus, it has been argued that DAI,while suited for unsituated, knowledgebased systems, will not succeed in the domain of cooperative robotics 134, 108. However, we observethat direct comparisons of DAI and alternativeparadigms are notably missing from the literaturesuch comparisons are needed to evaluate the trueutility of DAI techniques in cooperative robotics.Also, as lowerlevel processes perception and actuation are better understood and implemented,and as computational power increases, the highlevel results of DAI research may become increasingly applicable to collective mobile robotics.Distributed SystemsA multiplerobot system is in fact a special caseof a distributed system. Thus, the field of distributed systems is a natural source of ideas andsolutions. 25 describes cellular robotics as belonging to the general field of distributed computing. It is noted, however, that distributedcomputing can only contribute general theoreticalfoundations and that further progress needs to bemade concerning the application of such methodsto collective robotics. 171 states, a distributedcomputing system contains a collection of computing devices which may reside in geographicallyseparated locations called sites. By noting thesimilarities with distributed computing, theoriespertaining to deadlock 170, 171, 104, messagepassing 171 and resource allocation 166, and thecombination of the above as primitives 169, 173,have been applied to collective robotics in a number of works.In work done on multiple AGV systems andDistributed Robotic Systems, deadlock detectionand resource allocation methods are applied to allow many robots to share the limited resource ofpath space 171, 166. Pattern generation in aCRS may also rely on distributed computing to resolve conflicts 166, 171. Finally, 167, 168 describe a task allocation algorithm where the robotsvie for the right to participate in a task. See alsothe discussion in Section 2.1 and Section 2.5.Broadcast communication, which is widely assumed in cooperative robotics, exhibits poor scaling properties. As robots become more numerous and widely distributed, techniques and issuesfrom the field of computer networks become relevant. A rich body of research on algorithms,16 Cao, et al.protocols, performance modeling and analysis incomputer networks can be applied to cooperativerobotics. There is currently a great amount ofeffort being put into studying networking issuesrelated to mobilenomadicubiquitous computingcf. 20, 176, 88, 21. Results from this fieldcould be applied in a straightforward way to multirobot systems.Finally, distributed control is a promisingframework for the coordination of multiple robots.Due to difficulty of sensing and communication,a parsimonious formulation which can coordinaterobots having minimal sensing and communication capabilities is desirable. In an ideal scenario, maximal fault tolerance is possible, modeling of other agents is unnecessary, and eachagent is controlled by a very simple mechanism.A distributed control scheme known as the GURgame developed originally by 158 and recentlystudied in 159, 160 provides a framework inwhich groups of agents with minimal sensing capability and no communication are controlled bysimple finite state automata and converge to optimal behaviors. 160 describes possible cooperative robotics applications in moving platform control and perimeter guarding.BiologyBiological analogies and influences abound inthe field of cooperative robotics. The majority ofexisting work in the field has cited biological systems as inspiration or justification. Wellknowncollective behaviors of ants, bees, and other eusocial insects 179 provide striking existence proofsthat systems composed of simple agents can accomplish sophisticated tasks in the real world.It is widely held that the cognitive capabilitiesof these insects are very limited, and that complex behaviors emerge out of interactions betweenthe agents, which are individually obeying simplerules. Thus, rather than following the AI tradition of modeling robots as rational, deliberativeagents, some researchers in cooperative roboticshave chosen to take a more bottomup approachin which individual agents are more like ants they follow simple rules, and are highly reactivethis is the approach taken in the field of ArtificialLife. Works based on this insectcolony analogyinclude 108, 24, 153, 47, 82, 41, 42. Thepattern generation of CRSs can also be consideredas bottomup see Section 2.5, since each robotis designed as a very simple agent which follows aset of prespecified rules.A more general, biological metaphor that is often used in cooperative robotics is the conceptof a selforganizing system 122, 182. Notethat researchers from many fields have studied selforganization it is by no means an exclusively biological concept. However, in thefield of cooperative robotics, references to selforganization have often been made in a biological context. The behavior of insect colonies described above can be characterized more generallyas that of selforganizing systems. Representative work that is based on this concept includes170, 151, 69, 70, 26. Selforganization inmulticellular biological systems has been an inspiration for 71, 25, 51, 63. Hierarchical organization of biological multicellular organisms i.e.,from cellular to tissue to organism level has beenused as a guiding metaphor for cellular robotics inthe CEBOT project 59.Biological analogies have also influenced thechoice of task domains studied in cooperativerobotics. While foraging is a natural abstraction of some practical applications such as wasteretrieval and search and rescue, one major reason that it has become identified as the canonical cooperative robotic task is that it is a naturaltask, given the group architectures resulting fromanalogies to insect colonies. Another example ofthis phenomenon is the flockingherding task. Itseems no accident that biological inspirations ledto natural models of group motion, as opposedto more structured models of coordinated motionsuch as moving in some arbitrary formation.Finally, as we noted in Section 2.4, there havebeen some biological influences on the learningand optimization algorithms used to tune controlparameters in multiplerobot systems.4. ConclusionsWe have synthesized a view of the theoreticalbases for research in cooperative mobile robotics.Key research axes in the field were identified,particularly with respect to achieving a mechanism of cooperation, and existing works wereCooperative Mobile Robotics Antecedents and Directions 17surveyed in this framework. We then discussedtechnological constraints and interdisciplinary influences that have shaped the field, and offeredsome general precepts for future growth of thefield. Finally, we identified distributed artificialintelligence, biology, and distributed systems asdisciplines that are most relevant to cooperativerobotics, and which are most likely to continue toprovide valuable influences. Based on our synthesis, a number of open research areas become apparent. We believe that the following are amongthe major, yet tractable, challenges for the nearfuture1. robust definitions and metrics for various formsof cooperation,2. achieving a more complete theory of information requirements for tasksolving in spatial domains, perhaps for the canonical tasksof pattern formation or distributed sensinge.g., measures of pattern complexity, information lower bounds for pattern recognitionand maintenance, abstraction of sensor models from the solution approach. The works of45, 145, 33 have begun to address this issue,in the context of object manipulation tasks interestingly, 33 observes that given a robot system, some tasks are strongly cooperative  therobots must act in concert to achieve the goal,and the strategy for the task is not trivially serializable.3. principled transfer of the concepts of faulttolerance and reliability from the field of distributed and faulttolerant computing,4. incorporation of recent ideas in distributed control to achieve oblivious cooperation, or cooperation without communication e.g., whenrobots have minimal sensing and communication capabilities,5. achieving cooperation within competitive situations e.g., for robot soccer, or pursuitevasionwith multiple pursuers and evaders. An interesting open problem is how well solutions thathave been developed in discretized abstractionsof these domains cf. 101, 89 translate tothe physical world.AcknowledgementsPartial support for this work was provided byNSF Young Investigator Award MIP9257982 theUCLA Commotion Laboratory is supported byNSF CDA9303148.
