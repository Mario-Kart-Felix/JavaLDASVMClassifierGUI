First were mainframes, each shared by lots of people. Now we are in the personal computing era, person and machine staring uneasily at each other across the desktop. Next comes ubiquitous computing, or the age of calm technology, when technology recedes into the background of our lives.Mark Weiser,The Computer for the TwentyFirst Century, Scientific American, pp. 9410, September 1991.Site dedicated to Mark Weiserhttpwww.ubiq.comhypertextweiserUbiHome.html, Jan 07, 2007The most profound technologies are those that disappear.

model abstractionThe DempsterShafer theory is a mathematical theory of evidence1 based on belief functions and plausible reasoning, which is used to combine separate pieces of information evidence to calculate the probability of an event. The theory was developed by Arthur P. Dempster and Glenn Shafer.Sequential Bayesian filtering is a method to estimate the real value of an observed variable that evolves in time. The method is named filtering when we estimate the current value given past observations, smoothing when estimating past value given present and past measures, and prediction when estimating a probable future value.The Kalman filter is an efficient recursive filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of incomplete and noisy measurements. It was developed by Rudolf Kalman.Particle filters, also known as Sequential Monte Carlo methods SMC, are sophisticated model estimation techniques based on simulation.They are usually used to estimate Bayesian models and are the sequential online analogue of Markov chain Monte Carlo MCMC batch methods and are often similar to importance sampling methods. If well designed, particle filters can be much faster than MCMC. They are often an alternative to the Extended Kalman filter EKF or Unscented Kalman filter UKF with the advantage that, with sufficient samples, they approach the Bayesian optimal estimate, so they can be made more accurate than the EKF or UKF. The approaches can also be combined by using a version of the Kalman filter as a proposal distribution for the particle filter.Recursive Bayesian estimation is a general probabilistic approach for estimating an unknown probability density function recursively over time using incoming measurements and a mathematical process model. 18c Carlos Lisboa Bento, Ubiquitous Computing                                                                                                                                        Multisensor data fusionarchitecturesClientserver Data meets processing Permits a global view of the      objects from the original data Proved for realtime problems Established computational model Huge volumes of data traveling and     processed in realtime Difficult to scaleH.

It includes Kalman filters integration of GPS error, but it is not restricted to the past of each point. Its future is also important.CDF The new filter proved itself quite efficient in an urban environment with dense network, when used on the output of a standard Bluetooth GPS unit Sirf III and before feeding a road reduction filter with positions.The road reduction filter has since been rewrote and its overall complexity has dropped a lot, since this filter now feeds it with smooth, noisefree positions.The CDF is meant to work on positions received from the GPS unit i.e. after the GPS units Kalman Filters works,Recursive least squares RLS algorithm is used in adaptive filters to find the filter coefficients that relate to recursively producing the least squares minimum of the sum of the absolute squared of the error signal difference between the desired and the actual signal. This is contrast to other algorithms that aim to reduce the mean square error. The difference is that RLS filters are dependent on the signals themselves, whereas MSE filters are dependent on their statistics specifically, the autocorrelation of the input and the crosscorrelation of the input and desired signals. If these statistics are known, an MSE filter with fixed coefficients i.e., independent of the incoming data can be built.34Francisco C Pereira et al. 2007YouTraceFrancisco C Pereira, Nuno Pereira, Hugo Costa, Ana Almeida, Pedro Quaresma, Carlos Bento I t llige t Transport yst msc Carlos Lisboa Bento, Ubiquitous Computing                                                                                                                                        Map Matching a genetic algorithmic approacho An individual is a traceo Fitness favours low distance to base map, correct topology, less gapso Splitting into segments as in Chawathe 2007 to improve efficencyo Studying improvements in representation and possible GP approachFrancisco C Pereira et al. 200735YouTraceFrancisco C Pereira, Nuno Pereira, Hugo Costa, Ana Almeida, Pedro Quaresma, Carlos Bento Intelligent Transport Systemsc Carlos Lisboa Bento, Ubiquitous Computing                                                                                                                                        Aggregationo Given two or more distinct tracks that should intersect at some pointo Find, in one track the base map the point of aggregationo Find in the other track the new trace, the first point that didnt get matched to the first track base mapo Connect those two points with a smooth curve now using Hermite curves36Francisco C Pereira et al. 2007YouTraceFrancisco C Pereira, Nuno Pereira, Hugo Costa, Ana Almeida, Pedro Quaresma, Carlos Bento Intelligent Transport Systemsc Carlos Lisboa Bento, Ubiquitous Computing                                                                                                                                        UpdateEach GPS trace is used to improve the quality of that road as quality varies...
