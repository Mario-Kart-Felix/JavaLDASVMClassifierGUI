Marty Philip M Wells Dennis Abts is a Member of Technical Staff at Google, where he is involved in the system architecture and design of next-generation large-scale clusters. His research interests include scalable coherence protocols, memory consistency models, interconnection networks, fault tolerant computing and robust system design. Prior to joining Google, Dennis was a Sr. Principal Engineer and System Architect for Cray Inc. where he was principally involved with the architecture and design of several large-scale parallel computers over the span of his 10+ year tenure at Cray. Including, the Cray XT3 and XT4 (Red Storm), Cray X1, Cray BlackWidow (XT5), and next-generation systems sponsored by the DARPA HPCS initiative. Abts has technical publications and patents in the areas of interconnection networks, data-center networking, cache-coherence protocols, high-bandwidth memory systems, and supercomputing. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota, and is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and Senior Member of the IEEE Computer Society.
