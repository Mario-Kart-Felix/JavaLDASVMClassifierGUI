Chang Jeffrey C. Mogul Jichuan Chang Liqun Cheng Luiz AndrÃ© Barroso Rama Govindaraju Svilen Kanev Tipp Moseley Parthasarathy (Partha) Ranganathan is currently at Google designing their next-generation systems. Before this, he was a HP Fellow and Chief Technologist at Hewlett Packard Labs where he led their research on systems and datacenters. Dr. Ranganathan's research interests are in systems architecture and manageability, energy-efficiency, and systems modeling and evaluation. He has done extensive work in these areas including key contributions around energy-aware user interfaces, heterogeneous multi-core processors, power capping and power-aware server designs, federated enterprise power management, energy modeling and benchmarking, disaggregated blade server architectures, and most recently, storage hierarchy and systems redesign for non-volatile memory. He was also one of the primary developers of the publicly distributed Rice Simulator for ILP Multiprocessors (RSIM). Dr. Ranganathan's work has led to broad impact on both academia and industry including several commercial products such as Power Capping and HP Moonshot servers. He holds more than 50 patents (with another 45 pending) and has published extensively, including several award-winning papers. He also teaches regularly (including, most recently, at Stanford) and has contributed to several popular computer architecture textbooks. Dr. Ranganathan and his work have been featured on numerous occasions in the press including the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Business Week, San Francisco Chronicle, Times of India, Slashdot, Youtube, and Tom's hardware guide. Dr. Ranganathan has been named one of the world's top young innovators by MIT Technology Review, as one of the top 15 enterprise technology rock stars by Business Insider, and has been recognized with several other awards including the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award and Rice University's Outstanding Young Engineering Alumni award. Dr. Ranganathan received his B.Tech degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and his M.S. and Ph.D. from Rice University, Houston. He is also an ACM and IEEE Fellow.
