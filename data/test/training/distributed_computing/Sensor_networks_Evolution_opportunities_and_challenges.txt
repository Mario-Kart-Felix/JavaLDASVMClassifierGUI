INTRODUCTIONNetworked microsensors technology is a key technologyfor the future. In September 1999 1, Business Week heralded it as one of the 21 most important technologies for the21st century. Cheap, smart devices with multiple onboardsensors, networked through wireless links and the Internetand deployed in large numbers, provide unprecedented opportunities for instrumenting and controlling homes, cities,and the environment. In addition, networked microsensorsprovide the technology for a broad spectrum of systems inthe defense arena, generating new capabilities for reconnaissance and surveillance as well as other tactical applications.Manuscript received January 7, 2003 revised March 17, 2003.C.Y.

A system of networked sensors candetect and track threats e.g., winged and wheeled vehicles,personnel, chemical and biological agents and be used forweapon targeting and area denial. Each sensor node willhave embedded processing capability, and will potentiallyhave multiple onboard sensors, operating in the acoustic,seismic, infrared IR, and magnetic modes, as well asimagers and microradars. Also onboard will be storage,wireless links to neighboring nodes, and location and positioning knowledge through the global positioning systemGPS or local positioning algorithms.Networked microsensors belong to the general family ofsensor networks that use multiple distributed sensors to collect information on entities of interest. Table 1 summarizesthe range of possible attributes in general sensor networks.Current and potential applications of sensor networks include military sensing, physical security, air traffic control,traffic surveillance, video surveillance, industrial and manufacturing automation, distributed robotics, environmentmonitoring, and building and structures monitoring. Thesensors in these applications may be small or large, and thenetworks may be wired or wireless. However, ubiquitouswireless networks of microsensors probably offer the mostpotential in changing the world of sensing 2.While sensor networks for various applications may bequite different, they share common technical issues. Thispaper will present a history of research in sensor networksSection II, technology trends Section III, new applications Section IV, research issues and hard problems Section V, and some examples of research results Section VI.II. HISTORY OF RESEARCH IN SENSOR NETWORKSThe development of sensor networks requires technologies from three different research areas sensing, communication, and computing including hardware, software, and001892190317.00  2003 IEEEPROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 8, AUGUST 2003 1247Table 1Attributes of Sensor Networksalgorithms. Thus, combined and separate advancements ineach of these areas have driven research in sensor networks.Examples of early sensor networks include the radar networks used in air traffic control. The national power grid,with its many sensors, can be viewed as one large sensor network. These systems were developed with specialized computers and communication capabilities, and before the termsensor networks came into vogue.A. Early Research on Military Sensor NetworksAs with many technologies, defense applications havebeen a driver for research and development in sensor networks. During the Cold War, the Sound Surveillance SystemSOSUS, a system of acoustic sensors hydrophones on theocean bottom, was deployed at strategic locations to detectand track quiet Soviet submarines. Over the years, othermore sophisticated acoustic networks have been developedfor submarine surveillance. SOSUS is now used by theNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric AdministrationNOAA for monitoring events in the ocean, e.g., seismicand animal activity 3. Also during the Cold War, networksof air defense radars were developed and deployed to defendthe continental United States and Canada. This air defensesystem has evolved over the years to include aerostatsas sensors and Airborne Warning and Control SystemAWACS planes, and is also used for drug interdiction.These sensor networks generally adopt a hierarchicalprocessing structure where processing occurs at consecutivelevels until the information about events of interest reachesthe user. In many cases, human operators play a key role inthe system. Even though research was focused on satisfyingmission needs, e.g., acoustic signal processing and interpretation, tracking, and fusion, it provided some key processingtechnologies for modern sensor networks.B. Distributed Sensor Networks Program at the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects AgencyModern research on sensor networks started around 1980with the Distributed Sensor Networks DSN program at theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA.By this time, the Arpanet predecessor of the Internet hadbeen operational for a number of years, with about 200 hostsat universities and research institutes. R. Kahn, who wascoinventor of the TCPIP protocols and played a key rolein developing the Internet, was director of the InformationProcessing Techniques Office IPTO at DARPA. He wantedto know whether the Arpanet approach for communication could be extended to sensor networks. The networkwas assumed to have many spatially distributed lowcostsensing nodes that collaborate with each other but operateautonomously, with information being routed to whichevernode can best use the information.It was an ambitious program given the state of the art.This was the time before personal computers and workstations processing was done mostly on minicomputerssuch as PDP11 and VAX machines running Unix and VMS.Modems were operating at 300 to 9600 Bd, and Ethernetwas just becoming popular.Technology components for a DSN were identified in aDistributed Sensor Nets workshop in 1978 4. These included sensors acoustic, communication highlevel protocols that link processes working on a common applicationin a resourcesharing network 5, processing techniquesand algorithms including selflocation algorithms for sensors, and distributed software dynamically modifiable distributed systems and language design. Since DARPA wassponsoring much artificial intelligence AI research at thetime, the workshop also included talks on the use of AI forunderstanding signals and assessing situations 6, as wellas various distributed problemsolving techniques 79.Since very few technology components were available offthe shelf, the resulting DSN program had to address distributed computing support, signal processing, tracking, andtest beds. Distributed acoustic tracking was chosen as thetarget problem for demonstration.Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University CMU,Pittsburgh, PA, focused on providing a network operatingsystem that allows flexible, transparent access to distributedresources needed for a faulttolerant DSN. They developed1248 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 8, AUGUST 2003Fig. 1. Components in the DSN test bed around 1985.a communicationoriented operating system called Accent10, whose primitives support transparent networking,system reconfiguration, and rebinding. Accent evolved intothe Mach operating system 11, which found considerablecommercial acceptance. Other efforts at CMU includedprotocols for network interprocess communication tosupport dynamic rebinding of active communicating computations, an interface specification language for buildingdistributed system software, and a system for dynamic loadbalancing and fault reconfiguration of DSN software. Allthis was demonstrated in an indoor test bed with signalsources, acoustic sensors, and VAX computers connectedby Ethernet.Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyMIT, Cambridge, focused on knowledgebased signalprocessing techniques 12 for tracking helicopters using adistributed array of acoustic microphones by means of signalabstractions and matching techniques. Signal abstractionsview signals as consisting of multiple levels, with higherlevels of abstraction e.g., peaks obtained by suppressingdetailed information in lower levels e.g., spectrum. Theyprovide a conceptual framework for thinking about signalprocessing systems that resemble what people use wheninteractively processing and interpreting realworld signals.By incorporating human heuristics, this approach wasdesigned for high signaltonoise ratio situations wheremodels are lacking. In addition, MIT also developed theSignal Processing Language and Interactive ComputingEnvironment SPLICE for DSN data analysis and algorithmdevelopment, and Pitch Directors Assistant for interactivelyestimating fundamental frequency using domain knowledge.Moving up the processing chain, tracking multiple targetsin a distributed environment is significantly more difficultthan centralized tracking. The association of measurementsto tracks and estimation of target states position and velocity given associations have to be distributed over thesensor nodes. In the 1980s, Advanced Decision SystemsADS, Mountain View, CA, developed a multiplehypothesis tracking algorithm to deal with difficult situationsinvolving high target density, missing detections, and falsealarms, and decomposed the algorithm for distributedimplementation 13, 14. Multiplehypothesis tracking isnow a standard approach for difficult tracking problems.For demonstration, MIT Lincoln Laboratory developedthe realtime test bed for acoustic tracking of lowflyingaircraft 15. The sensors were acoustic arrays nine microphones arranged in three concentric triangles with the largestbeing 6 m across. A PDP1134 computer and an array processor processed the acoustic signals. The nodal computerfor target tracking consists of three MC68000 processorswith 256kB memory and 512kB shared memory, and acustom operating system. Communication was by Ethernetand microwave radio. Fig. 1 extracted from 16 shows theacoustic array nine white microphones, the mobile vehiclenode with an acoustically quiet generator in the back, and theequipment rack with the acoustictracking node and gatewaynode in the vehicle. Note the size of the system and thatpractically all components in the network were custom built.That was the state of the art in the early 1980s. The DSN testbed was demonstrated with lowflying aircraft, which wassuccessfully tracked with acoustic sensors as well as TVcameras. The tracking algorithm was fairly sophisticated,since the acoustic propagation delay is significant relative tothe speed of the aircraft.Another test bed in the DSN program was the distributedvehicle monitoring test bed at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. This was a research tool for empiricallyinvestigating distributed problem solving in networks. Thedistributed knowledgebased problem solving approach useda functionally accurate, cooperative architecture consistingof a network of HearsayII nodes blackboard architecturewith knowledge sources. Different local node controlapproaches were explored 17.C. Military Sensor Networks in the 1980s and 1990sEven though early researchers on sensor networks hadin mind large numbers of small sensors, the technologyfor small sensors was not quite ready. However, plannersof military systems quickly recognized the benefits ofsensor networks, which become a crucial component ofnetworkcentric warfare 18. In platformcentric warfare,platforms own specific weapons, which in turn ownsensors in a fairly rigid architecture. In other words, sensorsand weapons are mounted with and controlled by separateplatforms that operate independently. In networkcentricwarfare, sensors do not necessarily belong to weapons orplatforms. Instead, they collaborate with each other over acommunication network, and information is sent to the appropriate shooters. Sensor networks can improve detectionCHONG AND KUMAR SENSOR NETWORKS EVOLUTION, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHALLENGES 1249and tracking performance through multiple observations,geometric and phenomenological diversity, extended detection range, and faster response time. Also, the developmentcost is lower by exploiting commercial network technologyand common network interfaces.An example of networkcentric warfare is the CooperativeEngagement Capability CEC 19 developed by the U.S.Navy. This system consists of multiple radars collecting dataon air targets. Measurements are associated by a processingnode with reporting responsibility and shared with othernodes that process all measurements of interest. Since allnodes have access to essentially the same information, acommon operating picture essential for consistent militaryoperations is obtained. Other military sensor networks include acoustic sensor arrays for antisubmarine warfare suchas the Fixed Distributed System FDS and the AdvancedDeployable System ADS, and unattended ground sensorsUGS 20 such as the Remote Battlefield Sensor SystemREMBASS and the Tactical Remote Sensor SystemTRSS.D. Sensor Network Research in the 21st CenturyRecent advances in computing and communication havecaused a significant shift in sensor network research andbrought it closer to achieving the original vision. Small andinexpensive sensors based upon microelectromechanicalsystem MEMS 21 technology, wireless networking, andinexpensive lowpower processors allow the deployment ofwireless ad hoc networks for various applications. Again,DARPA started a research program on sensor networks toleverage the latest technological advances.The recently concluded DARPA Sensor InformationTechnology SensIT program 22 pursued two key research and development thrusts. First, it developed newnetworking techniques. In the battlefield context, thesesensor devices or nodes should be ready for rapid deployment, in an ad hoc fashion, and in highly dynamicenvironments. Todays networking techniques, developedfor voice and data and relying on a fixed infrastructure, willnot suffice for battlefield use. Thus, the program developednew networking techniques suitable for highly dynamicad hoc environments. The second thrust was networkedinformation processing, i.e., how to extract useful, reliable,and timely information from the deployed sensor network.This implies leveraging the distributed computing environment created by these sensors for signal and informationprocessing in the network, and for dynamic and interactivequerying and tasking the sensor network.SensIT generated new capabilities relative to todayssensors. Current systems such as the Tactical AutomatedSecurity System TASS 23 for perimeter security arededicated rather than programmable. They use technologiesbased on transmitonly nodes and a longrange detectionparadigm. SensIT networks have new capabilities. Thenetworks are interactive and programmable with dynamictasking and querying. A multitasking feature in the systemallows multiple simultaneous users. Finally, since detectionranges are much shorter in a sensor system, the software andalgorithms can exploit the proximity of devices to threats todrastically improve the accuracy of detection and tracking.The software and the overall system design supports lowlatency, energyefficient operation, builtin autonomy andsurvivability, and low probability of detection of operation.As a result, a network of SensIT nodes can support detection,identification, and tracking of threats, as well as targetingand communication, both within the network and to outsidethe network, such as an overhead asset.III. TECHNOLOGY TRENDSCurrent sensor networks can exploit technologies notavailable 20 years ago and perform functions that werenot even dreamed of at that time. Sensors, processors, andcommunication devices are all getting much smaller andcheaper. Commercial companies such as Ember, Crossbow,and Sensoria are now building and deploying small sensornodes and systems. These companies provide a vision ofhow our daily lives will be enhanced through a networkof small, embedded sensor nodes. In addition to productsfrom these companies, commercial offtheshelf personaldigital assistants PDAs using Palm or Pocket PC operatingsystems contain significant computing power in a smallpackage. These can easily be ruggedized to becomeprocessing nodes in a sensor network. Some of these deviceseven have builtin sensing capabilities, such as cameras.These powerful processors can be hooked to MEMS devicesand machines along with extensive databases and communication platforms to bring about a new era of technologicallysophisticated sensor nets.Wireless networks based upon IEEE 802.11 standardscan now provide bandwidth approaching those of wirednetworks. At the same time, the IEEE has noticed the lowexpense and high capabilities that sensor networks offer.The organization has defined the IEEE 802.15 standardfor personal area networks PANs, with personal networks defined to have a radius of 5 to 10 m. Networks ofshortrange sensors are the ideal technology to be employedin PANs. The IEEE encouragement of the development oftechnologies and algorithms for such short ranges ensurescontinued development of lowcost sensor nets 24. Furthermore, increases in chip capacity and processor productioncapabilities have reduced the energy per bit requirement forboth computing and communication. Sensing, computing,and communications can now be performed on a single chip,further reducing the cost and allowing deployment in everlarger numbers.Looking into the future, we predict that advances inMEMS technology will produce sensors that are even morecapable and versatile. For example, Dust Inc., Berkeley,CA, a company that sprung from the late 1990s SmartDust research project 25 at the University of California,Berkeley, is building MEMS sensors that can sense andcommunicate and yet are tiny enough to fit inside a cubicmillimeter. A Smart Dust optical mote uses MEMS to aimsubmillimetersized mirrors for communications. SmartDust sensors can be deployed using a 3 10 mm wavelet1250 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 8, AUGUST 2003Table 2Three Generations of Sensor NodesFig. 2. Three generations of sensor nodes.shaped like a maple tree seed and dropped to float to theground. A wireless network of these ubiquitous, lowcost,disposable microsensors can provide closein sensingcapabilities in many novel applications as discussed inSection IV.Table 2 compares three generations of sensor nodes Fig. 2shows their sizes.IV. NEW APPLICATIONSResearch on sensor networks was originally motivated bymilitary applications. Examples of military sensor networksrange from largescale acoustic surveillance systems forocean surveillance to small networks of unattended groundsensors for ground target detection. However, the availability of lowcost sensors and communication networks hasresulted in the development of many other potential applications, from infrastructure security to industrial sensing. Thefollowing are a few examples.A. Infrastructure SecuritySensor networks can be used for infrastructure securityand counterterrorism applications. Critical buildings andfacilities such as power plants and communication centershave to be protected from potential terrorists. Networks ofvideo, acoustic, and other sensors can be deployed aroundthese facilities. These sensors provide early detection ofpossible threats. Improved coverage and detection and areduced false alarm rate can be achieved by fusing the datafrom multiple sensors. Even though fixed sensors connectedby a fixed communication network protect most facilities,wireless ad hoc networks can provide more flexibility andadditional coverage when needed. Sensor networks can alsobe used to detect biological, chemical, and nuclear attacks.Examples of such networks can be found in 26, which alsodescribes other uses of sensor networks.B. Environment and Habitat MonitoringEnvironment and habitat monitoring 27 is a natural candidate for applying sensor networks, since the variables to bemonitored, e.g., temperature, are usually distributed over alarge region. The recently started Center for Embedded Network Sensing CENS 28, Los Angeles, CA, has a focus onenvironmental and habitat monitoring. Environmental sensors are used to study vegetation response to climatic trendsand diseases, and acoustic and imaging sensors can identify,track, and measure the population of birds and other species.On a very large scale, the System for the Vigilance of theAmazon SIVAM 29 provides environmental monitoring,drug trafficking monitoring, and air traffic control for theAmazon Basin. Sponsored by the government of Brazil, thislarge sensor network consists of different types of interconnected sensors including radar, imagery, and environmentalsensors. The imagery sensors are space based, radars are located on aircraft, and environmental sensors are mostly onthe ground. The communication network connecting the sensors operates at different speeds. For example, highspeednetworks connect sensors on satellites and aircraft, whilelowspeed networks connect the groundbased sensors.C. Industrial SensingCommercial industry has long been interested in sensingas a means of lowering cost and improving machine andperhaps user performance and maintainability. Monitoringmachine health through determination of vibration orwear and lubrication levels, and the insertion of sensorsinto regions inaccessible by humans, are just two examplesof industrial applications of sensors. Several years ago,the IEEE and the National Institute for Standards andTechnology NIST launched the P1451 Smart TransducerCHONG AND KUMAR SENSOR NETWORKS EVOLUTION, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHALLENGES 1251Interface Standard 30 to enable full plugandplay ofsensors and networks in industrial environments. Factorieshave continued to automate production and assembly lineswith remote sensing nets, implementing sophisticatedonline quality control tests enabled by the sensors. Remote,wireless sensors in particular can enable a factory to be instrumented after the fact to ensure and maintain compliancewith federal safety and guidelines while keeping installationcosts low.Spectral sensors are one example of sensing in an industrial environment. From simple optical devices such asoptrodes and pH probes to true spectral devices that canfunction as miniature spectrometers, optical sensors canreplace existing instruments and perform material propertyand composition measurements. Optical sensing is alsofacilitated by miniaturization, as lowcost chargecoupleddevice CCD array devices and microengineering enablesmaller, smarter sensors. The goal of this and other industrialsensing is to enable multipoint or matrix sensing inputsfrom hundreds or thousands of sensors feed into databasesthat can be queried in any number of ways to show realtimeinformation on a large or small scale.D. Traffic ControlSensor networks have been used for vehicle traffic monitoring and control for quite a while. Most traffic intersections have either overhead or buried sensors to detect vehiclesand control traffic lights. Furthermore, video cameras are frequently used to monitor road segments with heavy traffic,with the video sent to human operators at central locations.However, these sensors and the communication network thatconnect them are costly thus, traffic monitoring is generally limited to a few critical points. Inexpensive wireless adhoc networks will completely change the landscape of trafficmonitoring and control. Cheap sensors with embedded networking capability can be deployed at every road intersectionto detect and count vehicle traffic and estimate its speed. Thesensors will communicate with neighboring nodes to eventually develop a global traffic picture which can be queriedby human operators or automatic controllers to generate control signals.Another more radical concept 33 has the sensors attachedto each vehicle. As the vehicles pass each other, they exchange summary information on the location of traffic jamsand the speed and density of traffic, information that maybe generated by ground sensors. These summaries propagatefrom vehicle to vehicle and can be used by drivers to avoidtraffic jams and plan alternative routes.V. HARD PROBLEMS AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGESSensors networks in general pose considerable technicalproblems in data processing, communication, and sensormanagement some of these were identified and researchedin the first DSN program. Because of potentially harsh, uncertain, and dynamic environments, along with energy andbandwidth constraints, wireless ad hoc networks pose additional technical challenges in network discovery, networkcontrol and routing, collaborative information processing,querying, and tasking.A. Ad Hoc Network DiscoveryKnowledge of the network is essential for a sensor in thenetwork to operate properly. Each node needs to know theidentity and location of its neighbors to support processingand collaboration. In planned networks, the topology of thenetwork is usually known a priori. For ad hoc networks, thenetwork topology has to be constructed in real time, and updated periodically as sensors fail or new sensors are deployed31. In the case of a mobile network, since the topology isalways evolving, mechanisms should be provided for the different fixed and mobile sensors to discover each other. Globalknowledge generally is not needed, since each sensor nodeinteracts only with its neighbors. In addition to knowledgeof the topology, each sensor also needs to know its own location 32. When selflocation by GPS is not feasible or tooexpensive, other means of selflocation, such as relative positioning algorithms, have to be provided.B. Network Control and RoutingThe network must deal with resourcesenergy, bandwidth, and the processing powerthat are dynamicallychanging, and the system should operate autonomously,changing its configuration as required. Since there is noplanned connectivity in ad hoc networks, connectivity mustemerge as needed from the algorithms and software. Sincecommunication links are unreliable and shadow fadingmay eliminate links, the software and system design shouldgenerate the required reliability. This requires research intoissues such as network size or the number of links andnodes needed to provide adequate redundancy. Also, fornetworks on the ground, RF transmission degrades withdistance much faster than in free space, which means thatcommunication distance and energy must be well managed.Protocols must be internalized in design and not requireoperator intervention.Alternative approaches to traditional Internet methodssuch as Internet Protocols IP, including mobile IP, areneeded. One of the benefits of not requiring IP addressesat each node is that one can deploy network devices invery large numbers. Also, in contrast to the case of IP,routes are built up from geoinformation, on an asneededbasis, and optimized for survivability and energy. This is away to form connections on demand, for dataspecific orapplicationspecific purposes. IP is not likely to be a viablecandidate in this context, since it needs to maintain routingtables for the global topology, and because updates in adynamic sensor network environment incur heavy overheadin terms of time, memory, and energy.Survivability and adaptation to the environment areensured through deploying an adequate number of nodesto provide redundancy in paths, and algorithms to find1252 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 8, AUGUST 2003the right paths. Diffusion routing methods, which relyonly upon information at neighboring nodes, are a way toaddress this 33, although such methods may not achievethe informationtheoretic capacity of a spatially distributedwireless network 34. Another important design issue isthe investigation of how system parameters such as networksize, and density of nodes per square mile affect the tradeoffsbetween latency, reliability, and energy.C. Collaborative Signal and Information ProcessingThe nodes in an ad hoc sensor network collaborate tocollect and process data to generate useful information.Collaborative signal and information processing over a network is a new area of research and is related to distributedinformation fusion. Important technical issues include thedegree of information sharing between nodes and how nodesfuse the information from other nodes. Processing data frommore sensors generally results in better performance but alsorequires more communication resources and, thus, energy.Similarly, less information is lost when communicatinginformation at a lower level e.g., raw signals, but requiresmore bandwidth. Therefore, one needs to consider the multiple tradeoffs between performance and resource utilizationin collaborative signal and information processing usingmicrosensors.When a node receives information from another node,this information has to be combined and fused with localinformation. Fusion approaches range from simple rulesof picking the best result to modelbased techniques thatconsider how the information is generated. Again there is atradeoff between performance and robustness. Simple fusionrules are robust but suboptimal while more sophisticated andhigher performance fusion rules may be sensitive to the underlying models. In a networked environment, informationmay arrive at a node after traveling over multiple paths. Thefusion algorithm should recognize the dependency in theinformation to be fused and avoid double counting. Keepingtrack of data pedigree is an approach used in networks withlarge and powerful sensor nodes, but this approach may notbe practical for ad hoc networks with limited processing andcommunication resources.Sensor networks are frequently used in the detection,tracking, and classification of targets 13. Data associationis an important problem when multiple targets are present ina small region. Each node must associate its measurementsof the environment with individual targets. In addition, targets detected by one node have to be associated with targetsdetected by other nodes to avoid duplication and enablefusion. Optimal data association is computationally expensive and requires significant bandwidth for communication.Thus distributed data association is also a tradeoff betweenperformance and resource utilization, requiring distributeddata association algorithms tailored to sensor nets.Other processing issues include how to meet missionlatency and reliability requirements, and how to maximize sensor network operational life. A dense networkof cheap sensors may allow spatial sampling without theneed for expensive algorithms. These algorithms must beasynchronous, as the processor speeds and communicationcapabilities may vary or even disappear and reappear. Sensornodes must determine results with progressively increasingaccuracy, and so the processes can be terminated whenenough precision is gained.D. Tasking and QueryingA sensor field is like a database with many unique features.Data is dynamically acquired from the environment, as opposed to being entered by an operator. The data is distributedacross nodes, and geographically dispersed nodes are connected by unreliable links. These features render the databaseview more challenging, particularly for military applicationsgiven the lowlatency, realtime, and highreliability requirements of the battlefield.It is important that users have a simple interface to interactively task and query the sensor network. An example ofa humannetwork interface is a handheld unit that acceptsspeech input. The users should be able to command accessto information, e.g., operational priority and type of target,while hiding details about individual sensors. One challengeis to develop a language for querying and tasking, as wellas a database that can be readily queried. 35. Other challenges include finding efficient distributed mechanisms forquery and task compilation and placement, data organization,and caching.Mobile platforms can carry sensors and query devices. Asa result, seamless internetworking between mobile and fixeddevices in the absence of any infrastructure is a critical andunique requirement for sensor networks. For example, an airborne querying device could initiate a query, and then tell theground sensor network that it will be flying over a specific location after a minute, where the response to the query shouldbe exfiltrated.E. SecuritySince the sensor network may operate in a hostileenvironment, security should be built into the design andnot as an afterthought. Network techniques are needed toprovide lowlatency, survivable, and secure networks. Lowprobability of detection communication is needed for networks because sensors are being envisioned for use behindenemy lines. For the same reasons, the network should beprotected again intrusion and spoofing.VI. SOME RECENT RESULTSResearch sponsored by the DARPA SensIT and otherprograms has addressed the challenges described previously.The following are examples of some recent research results.A. Localized Algorithms and Directed Diffusion 33As discussed previously, even though centralized algorithms that collect data from multiple sensor nodesCHONG AND KUMAR SENSOR NETWORKS EVOLUTION, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHALLENGES 1253can potentially provide the best performance, they areundesirable because of high communication cost and lackof robustness and reliability. In localized or distributedalgorithms, the sensor nodes only communicate with sensorswithin a neighborhood. Localized algorithms are attractivebecause they are robust to network changes and nodefailures. The communication cost also scales well withincreasing network size. However, localized algorithms aredifficult to design because of the potentially complicatedrelationship between local behavior and global behavior.Algorithms that are locally optimal may not perform well ina global sense. How to optimally distribute the computationof a centralized algorithm in a distributed implementationcontinues to be a research problem.Estrin et al. 33 developed directed diffusion routing algorithms that belong to the class of localized algorithms. Diffusion is a form of broadcast routing that does not specify adestination node address such as the IP address in Internetprotocols. Packets are forwarded to neighboring nodes, anda direction or gradient is overlaid to control the broadcast orforwarding of the packet, which eventually reaches the destination. The gradient could be based on geographic information or other attributes such as power, congestion, and otherresources available in the network nodes. For example, if auser application based at location , is interested in eventsoccurring at and around location , then the nodes aroundwould forward information packets to neighboring nodesthat are in the direction of  and intermediate nodes wouldalso forward to their neighbors in the direction of . Gradients can also be established in terms of information producersand consumers via publishsubscribe mechanisms, and consumer interests in specific information types propagated overthe network. Intermediate nodes may cache or transform thedata locally to increase efficiency, robustness and scalability.Research results indicate the efficiency of directed diffusion. It requires considerably less energy than standardrouting mechanisms such as flooding and omniscient multicast. For instance, simulation and experimental results ofdirected diffusion in representative sensor networks 36 indicate that multicast protocols such as omniscient multicast36, which is an IPbased multicast routing technique requires less than half the energy required for flooding, anddiffusion requires only 60 of the energy needed for evenmulticast. These savings are achieved by eliminating pathsspent delivering redundant data, and from innetwork aggregation such as through intermediate nodes suppressing duplicate location estimates.B. Distributed Tracking in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks 37Tracking mobile targets is an important application ofsensor networks for both military and defense systems.Even though target tracking has been widely studied forsensor networks with large nodes and distributed trackingalgorithms are available 13, tracking in ad hoc networkswith microsensors poses different challenges due to communication, processing and energy constraints. In particular,the sensors should collaborate and share data to exploitthe benefits of sensor data fusion, but this should be donewithout sending data requests to and collecting data fromall sensors, thus overloading the network and using up theenergy supply.Zhao et al. 38 addressed the dynamic sensor collaboration problem in distributed tracking to determinedynamically which sensor is most appropriate to performthe sensing, what needs to be sensed, and to whom tocommunicate the information. They developed the informationdriven sensor querying IDSQ approach, enablingcollaboration based upon resource constraints and the costof transmitting information. Each sensor computes the predicted information utility of a piece of nonlocal sensor dataand uses this measure to determine from which sensor torequest data. Information utility functions employed includeentropy, Mahalanobis distance, and a measure on expectedposterior distribution. This approach was demonstrated withsimulations as well as experimental data collected from thefield.As discussed in Section VC, data association is neededin tracking multiple targets that are close to each other relative to the sensor measurement error. Again, distributed dataassociation algorithms are available for networks with largenodes but are computationally too expensive to implementon ad hoc networks. An approximate approach for cheap dataassociation called identity management was proposed anddemonstrated in 39.C. Distributed Classification in Sensor Networks UsingMobile Agents 40In a traditional sensor network, data is collected by individual sensors and sent to possibly multiple fusion nodesfor processing. Because the bandwidth of a wireless sensornetwork is typically lower than that of a wired network, asensor networks communications requirements may exceedtheir capacities. Mobile agents have been proposed as a solution to this dilemma 40. In a mobileagentbased DSN,data stay at each local site or sensor, while the integration orfusion code is moved to the data. Communication bandwidthrequirement may be reduced if the agent is smaller in sizethan the data. If this assumption holds, then the sensor network is more scalable, since the performance of the networkis not affected by an increase in the number of sensors. Thenetwork can also adapt better to the network load and agentscan be programmed to carry specific fusion processes. Distributed target classification has been used to demonstrate theeffectiveness of the approach.VII. CONCLUSIONWhen the concept of DSNs was first introduced more thantwo decades ago, it was more a vision than a technologyready to be exploited. The early researchers in DSN wereseverely handicapped by the state of the art in sensors,computers, and communication networks. Even though the1254 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 91, NO. 8, AUGUST 2003benefits of sensor networks were quickly recognized, theirapplication was mostly limited to large military systems.Technological advances in the past decade have completelychanged the situation. MEMS technology, more reliablewireless communication, and lowcost manufacturing haveresulted in small, inexpensive, and powerful sensors withembedded processing and wireless networking capability.Such wireless sensor networks can be used in many newapplications, ranging from environmental monitoring to industrial sensing, as well as traditional military applications.In fact, the applications are only limited by our imagination.Networks of small, possibly microscopic sensors embeddedin the fabric of society in buildings and machinery, and evenon people, performing automated continual and discretemonitoring, could drastically enhance our understanding ofour physical environment.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThe authors would like to thank Mr. D.
