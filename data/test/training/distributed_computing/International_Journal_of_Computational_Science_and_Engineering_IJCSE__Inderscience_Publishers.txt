New challenges arise in the modelling of complex systems, sophisticated algorithms, advanced scientific and engineering computing and associated (multidisciplinary) problem-solving environments. IJCSE addresses the state of the art of all aspects of computational science and engineering, highlighting computational methods and techniques for science and engineering applications.   About this journal Editorial Board Notes for authors  Topics covered include Scientific and engineering computing, related/interdisciplinary applications Problem-solving environments, complex systems, cyber security Advanced numerical computation and optimisation Parallel and distributed computing Web-based and service computing Performance modelling, evaluation and optimisation Wearable computing Cognitive computing and networks Programming models in GPUs and cloud Distributed/federated information; knowledge management/discovery Big data mining/applications; data analytics algorithms/applications Swarm and artificial intelligence Modelling/simulation, visualisation, virtual/augmented reality Remote sensing and multi/hyperspectral imaging Computational finance More on this journal... Objectives The objective of IJCSE is to provide an outstanding channel for researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, researchers from various application areas who are pioneering advanced application of computational methods to sciences, engineering, arts and humanities fields, along with software developers and vendors, to contribute and to disseminate innovative and important new work, and to shape future directions for research, as well as to help industrial professionals apply various advanced computational techniques. Readership Scientists, engineers, researchers, graduate students, educators, programmers, industrial professionals and managers. Contents IJCSE is a refereed international journal providing an international forum to report, discuss and exchange experimental results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the area of computational science and engineering. Papers should be of a quality that represents the state of the art in the field, bringing together the latest computing advances for scientific and engineering research, applications, and education, and stimulating future trends.   Hide Browse issues Vol. 14 2017 Vol. 14 No. 1 Vol. 13 2016 Vol. 13 No. 4 2016 Vol. 13 No. 3 2016 Vol. 13 No. 2 2016 Vol. 13 No. 1 Vol. 12 2016 Vol. 12 No. 4 2016 Vol. 12 No. 2/3 2016 Vol. 12 No. 1 Vol. 11 2015 Vol. 11 No. 4 2015 Vol. 11 No. 3 2015 Vol. 11 No. 2 2015 Vol. 11 No. 1 Vol. 10 2015 Vol. 10 No. 4 2015 Vol. 10 No. 3 2015 Vol. 10 No. 1/2 Vol. 9 2014 Vol. 9 No. 5/6 2014 Vol. 9 No. 4 2014 Vol. 9 No. 3 2014 Vol. 9 No. 1/2   More volumes...   More on permissions  IJCSE is indexed in: Scopus (Elsevier) Compendex [formerly Ei] (Elsevier) Emerging Sources Citation Index (Clarivate Analytics) Academic OneFile (Gale) ACM Digital Library   More indexes... cnpLINKer (CNPIEC) Computer Database (Gale) DBLP Computer Science Bibliography Expanded Academic ASAP (Gale) General OneFile (Gale) Google Scholar Info Trac (Gale) Inspec (Institution of Engineering and Technology) Pascal (INIST-CNRS) ProQuest Advanced Technologies Database with Aerospace Hide    IJCSE is listed in: Cabell's Directory of Publishing Opportunities Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA)   More journal lists/directories...
