Distributed Cognition Toward a NewFoundation for HumanComputerInteraction ResearchJAMES HOLLAN, EDWIN HUTCHINS, and DAVID KIRSHUniversity of California, San DiegoWe are quickly passing through the historical moment when people work in front of a singlecomputer, dominated by a small CRT and focused on tasks involving only local information.Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant rolesin our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. Forhumancomputer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understandthe emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to thedesktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computermediatedinteractions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play inunderstanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been onwhole environments what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them.Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing andsupporting humancomputer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributedcognition as a new foundation for humancomputer interaction, sketch an integrated researchframework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework canprovide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.Categories and Subject Descriptors D.2.1 Software Engineering RequirementsSpecificationsMethodologies e.g., objectoriented, structured H.1.2 Models and PrinciplesUserMachine Systems H.5.2 Information Interfaces and Presentation User InterfacesEvaluationmethodology H.5.3 Information Interfaces and Presentation Groupand Organization InterfacesTheory and models EvaluationmethodologyGeneral Terms Design, Human Factors, TheoryAdditional Key Words and Phrases Cognitive science, distributed cognition, ethnography,humancomputer interaction, research methodologyThis work was supported by grant 9873156 from the National Science Foundation.

INTRODUCTIONAs computation becomes ubiquitous, and our environments are enrichedwith new possibilities for communication and interaction, the field ofhumancomputer interaction confronts difficult challenges of supportingcomplex tasks, mediating networked interactions, and managing and exploiting the ever increasing availability of digital information. Research tomeet these challenges requires a theoretical foundation that is not onlycapable of addressing the complex issues involved in effective design of newcommunication and interaction technologies but also one that ensures ahumancentered focus. In this article we argue that the theory of distributed cognition Hutchins 1995a Norman 1993 Saloman 1993 provides aneffective theoretical foundation for understanding humancomputer interaction and a fertile framework for designing and evaluating digital artifacts.The theory of distributed cognition, like any cognitive theory, seeks tounderstand the organization of cognitive systems. Unlike traditional theories, however, it extends the reach of what is considered cognitive beyondthe individual to encompass interactions between people and with resources and materials in the environment. It is important from the outsetto understand that distributed cognition refers to a perspective on all ofcognition, rather than a particular kind of cognition. It can be distinguished from other approaches by its commitment to two related theoretical principles.The first of these principles concerns the boundaries of the unit ofanalysis for cognition. In every area of science, the choices made concerningthe boundaries of the unit of analysis have important implications. Intraditional views of cognition the boundaries are those of individuals.Sometimes the traditionally assumed boundaries are exactly right. Forother phenomena, however, these boundaries either span too much or toolittle. Distributed cognition looks for cognitive processes, wherever theymay occur, on the basis of the functional relationships of elements thatparticipate together in the process. A process is not cognitive simplybecause it happens in a brain, nor is a process noncognitive simply becauseit happens in the interactions among many brains. For example, we havefound it productive to consider small sociotechnical systems such as thebridge of a ship Hutchins 1995a or an airline cockpit Hutchins 1995bHutchins and Klausen 1996 Hutchins and Palen 1997 as our unit ofanalysis. In distributed cognition, one expects to find a system that candynamically configure itself to bring subsystems into coordination to accomplish various functions. A cognitive process is delimited by the functional relationships among the elements that participate in it, rather thanby the spatial colocation of the elements.The second principle that distinguishes distributed cognition concernsthe range of mechanisms that may be assumed to participate in cognitiveprocesses. Whereas traditional views look for cognitive events in themanipulation of symbols inside individual actors, distributed cognitionDistributed Cognition  175ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.looks for a broader class of cognitive events and does not expect all suchevents to be encompassed by the skin or skull of an individual. Forexample, an examination of memory processes in an airline cockpit showsthat memory involves a rich interaction between internal processes, themanipulation of objects, and the traffic in representations among the pilots.A complete theory of individual memory by itself is insufficient to understand how this memory system works. Furthermore, the physical environment of thinking provides more than simply additional memory available tothe same processes that operate on internal memories. The material worldalso provides opportunities to reorganize the distributed cognitive systemto make use of a different set of internal and external processes.In distributed cognition, one expects to find a system that can dynamically configure itself to bring subsystems into coordination to accomplishvarious functions. A cognitive process is delimited by the functional relationships among the elements that participate in it, rather than by thespatial colocation of the elements. When one applies these principles to theobservation of human activity in the wild, at least three interesting kindsof distribution of cognitive process become apparentCognitive processes may be distributed across the members of a socialgroup.Cognitive processes may involve coordination between internal and external material or environmental structure.Processes may be distributed through time in such a way that theproducts of earlier events can transform the nature of later events.In order to understand human cognitive accomplishments and to designeffective humancomputer interactions it is essential that we grasp thenature of these distributions of process. In the next section we elaborate adistributed cognition approach before describing in Section 3 how thetheory of distributed cognition may provide a new foundation for HCI andin Section 4 how it can help the design of new digital work materials.2. A DISTRIBUTED COGNITION APPROACH2.1 Socially Distributed CognitionThe idea of socially distributed cognition, prefigured by Roberts 1964, isfinding new popularity. Anthropologists and sociologists studying knowledge and memory, AI researchers building systems to do distributedproblem solving, social psychologists studying small group problem solvingand jury decision making, organizational scientists studying organizationallearning, philosophers of science studying discovery processes, and economists and political scientists exploring the relations of individual andgroup rationality, all have taken stances that lead them to a considerationof the cognitive properties of societies of individuals. One idea that is176  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.emerging is that social organization is itself a form of cognitive architecture.The argument is as follows. Cognitive processes involve trajectories ofinformation transmission and transformation, so the patterns of theseinformation trajectories, if stable, reflect some underlying cognitive architecture. Since social organizationplus the structure added by the contextof activitylargely determines the way information flows through a group,social organization may itself be viewed as a form of cognitive architecture.If this view is accepted, it has an odd consequence we can use theconcepts, constructs, and explanatory models of social groups to describewhat is happening in a mind. Thus for instance, Minsky, in Society of MindMinsky 1986, argues that ...each brain contains hundreds of differenttypes of machines, interconnected in specific ways which predestine thatbrain to become a large, diverse society of partially specialized agencies.He then goes on to examine how coalitions of these agents coordinate theiractivities to achieve goals. The implication, of course, is that the cognitionof an individual is also distributed.Distributed cognition means more than that cognitive processes aresocially distributed across the members of a group. It is a broader conception that includes phenomena that emerge in social interactions as well asinteractions between people and structure in their environments. Thisperspective highlights three fundamental questions about social interactions 1 how are the cognitive processes we normally associate with anindividual mind implemented in a group of individuals, 2 how do thecognitive properties of groups differ from the cognitive properties of thepeople who act in those groups, and 3 how are the cognitive properties ofindividual minds affected by participation in group activities2.2 Embodied CognitionA second tenet of the distributed cognition approach is that cognition isembodied. It is not an incidental matter that we have bodies locking uscausally into relations with our immediate environments. Causal couplingis an essential fact of cognition that evolution has designed us to exploit.In recent years this idea has gained increasingly strong support Brooks1991 Clark 1997 Kirsh 1995 1996 Lakoff 1987 Maturana and Varella1987 Thelen 1995 Turvey et al. 1981 Varlea et al. 1991. Minds are notpassive representational engines, whose primary function is to createinternal models of the external world. The relations between internalprocesses and external ones are far more complex, involving coordination atmany different time scales between internal resourcesmemory, attention,executive functionand external resourcesthe objects, artifacts, andathand materials constantly surrounding us.From the perspective of distributed cognition, the organization of mindboth in development and in operationis an emergent property of interactions among internal and external resources. In this view, the human bodyand the material world take on central rather than peripheral roles. AsDistributed Cognition  177ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.Andy Clark put it, To thus take the body and world seriously is to invitean emergentist perspective on many key phenomenato see adaptivesuccess as inhering as much in the complex interactions among body,world, and brain as in the inner processes bounded by the skin and skullClark 1997.For the design of work environments, this means that work materials aremore than mere stimuli for a disembodied cognitive system. Work materials from time to time become elements of the cognitive system itself. Justas a blind persons cane or a cell biologists microscope is a central part ofthe way they perceive the world, so welldesigned work materials becomeintegrated into the way people think, see, and control activities, part of thedistributed system of cognitive control.2.3 Culture and CognitionA third tenet of the theory of distributed cognition is that the study ofcognition is not separable from the study of culture, because agents live incomplex cultural environments. This means, on the one hand, that cultureemerges out of the activity of human agents in their historical contexts, asmental, material and social structures interact, and on the other hand, thatculture in the form of a history of material artifacts and social practices,shapes cognitive processes, particularly cognitive processes that are distributed over agents, artifacts, and environments. Hutchins treats this atlength in his recent book, Cognition in the Wild Hutchins 1995a.Permitting the boundary of the unit of analysis to move out beyond theskin situates the individual as an element in a complex cultural environment Cole 1996 Shore 1996 Strauss and Quinn 1998. In doing this, wefind that cognition is no longer isolated from culture or separate from it.Where cognitive science traditionally views culture as a body of content onwhich the cognitive processes of individual persons operate, in the distributed cognition perspective, culture shapes the cognitive processes of systems that transcend the boundaries of individuals Hutchins 1995a.At the heart of this linkage of cognition with culture lies the notion thatthe environment people are embedded in is, among other things, a reservoirof resources for learning, problem solving, and reasoning. Culture is aprocess that accumulates partial solutions to frequently encountered problems. Without this residue of previous activity, we would all have to findsolutions from scratch. We could not build on the success of others.Accordingly, culture provides us with intellectual tools that enable us toaccomplish things that we could not do without them. This is tremendouslyenabling. But it is not without cost. For culture may also blind us to otherways of thinking, leading us to believe that certain things are impossiblewhen in fact they are possible when viewed differently.Distributed cognition returns culture, context, and history to the pictureof cognition. But these things cannot be added onto the existing model ofcognitive processes without modifying the old model. That is, the new viewof culturally embedded cognition requires that we remake our model of theindividual mind.178  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.2.4 Ethnography of Distributed Cognitive SystemsA major consequence of the tenets of embodimentcultural immersion andsocial distributionis that we need a new kind of cognitive ethnography toproperly investigate the functional properties of distributed cognitive systems. The ethnographic methods associated with cognitive anthropology inthe 1960s and 1970s focused on meaning systems especially, but notexclusively, the meanings of words Agar 1986 Tyler 1969 Werner andSchoepfle 1987. Meanings were sought in the contents of individual mindsHutchins 1980 Kronenfeld 1996 Wallace 1970. The ethnography ofdistributed cognitive systems retains an interest in individual minds, butadds to that a focus on the material and social means of the construction ofaction and meaning. It situates meaning in negotiated social practices, andattends to the meanings of silence and the absence of action in context aswell as to words and actions Hutchins and Palen 1997.The theoretical emphasis on distributed cognitive processes is reflectedin the methodological focus on events. Since the cognitive properties ofsystems that are larger than an individual play out in the activity of thepeople in them, a cognitive ethnography must be an eventcentered ethnography. We are interested not only in what people know, but in how they goabout using what they know to do what they do. This is in contrast toearlier versions of cognitive ethnography which focused on the knowledgeof individuals and largely ignored action.Cognitive ethnography is not any single data collection or analysistechnique. Rather it brings together many specific techniques, some ofwhich have been developed and refined in other disciplines e.g., interviewing, surveys, participant observation, and video and audio recording.Which specific technique is applied depends on the nature of the settingand the questions being investigated. Because of the prominence of eventsand activity in the theory, we give special attention to video and audiorecording and the analysis of recordings of events Goodwin and Goodwin1996 Suchman 1987. In humancomputer interaction settings we expectautomated recording of histories of interaction Hill and Hollan 1994 tobecome an increasingly important source of data.The theory holds that cognitive activity is constructed from both internaland external resources, and that the meanings of actions are grounded inthe context of activity. This means that in order to understand situatedhuman cognition, it is not enough to know how the mind processesinformation. It is also necessary to know how the information to beprocessed is arranged in the material and social world. This, in turn, meansthat there is no substitute for technical expertise in the domain understudy. This is why participant observation is such an important componentof cognitive ethnography.The approach to humancomputer interaction we propose here requiresresearchers to make a real commitment to a domain. If one is to talk toexperts in a meaningful way about their interactions with structure intheir task environments, one must know what that structure is and how itDistributed Cognition  179ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.may be organized. One must also know the processes actors engage in andthe resources they use to render their actions and experiences meaningful.This perspective provides new insights for the design of conceptuallymeaningful tools and work environments. It implies that their designshould take into account the ways actors can achieve coordination with thedynamic behavior of active work materials.As we will discuss later, design of new digital displays and interfacesrisks inadvertently destroying many of the most valuable aspects of currentways of doing things because we do not understand how they work. Forexample, consider the development of the airspeed tape in stateoftheartcockpits. The overt function of the airspeed indicator is to show the pilotthe airspeed of the aircraft. But an analysis of how airspeed instrumentsare actually used shows that the way pilots use airspeed instruments ismore complex and more interesting than might have been suspectedHutchins 1995b. The features that the pilot uses in the rounddialinstrument have been inadvertently removed from the airspeed tapes of allof the current stateortheart cockpits Airbus, McDonnell Douglas, Boeing, Fokker. This is not an inevitable consequence of using digital displaytechnology in the cockpit it is, rather, a consequence of design that is notbased on solid cognitive ethnography. The very newest airline cockpit thatin the Boeing 737700 contains a replication of the old electromechanicalinstrument, now rendered in a digital display. This is probably better thanthe digital airspeed tapes, but one wonders why the designers could not getthe appropriate behavior in the tapes, and why, in order to get the rightbehavior, they had to resort to a literal copy of the old instrument.We believe that what was lacking was a method that could identify thecritical features of the interactions between pilots and the old instrumentand a theoretical language in which these features could be expressed in asufficiently abstract form that they could be moved to a very differentdisplay format. By combining observations of pilots in flight with study ofoperations manuals, interviews with pilots, and participation in the training programs for two modern airliners, Hutchins was able to establish thatpilots use the airspeed indicator dial as a material anchor for a conceptualspace of meaningful airspeeds. They only rarely think of the speed as anumber. Instead, they use the spatial structure of the display to makeperceptual inferences about relations among actual and desired speeds.While digital display design is an important research topic, and one withwhich we are concerned, what we are proposing is more fundamental aresearch framework that integrates distributed cognition theory with methods for design of digital work materials.3. AN INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK FOR RESEARCHThe field of humancomputer interaction could certainly benefit from anintegrated research framework. The framework we propose contains theelements shown in Figure 1. Although this entire integrated program hasnever before been assembled, our previous work has led us to this inte180  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.grated program, and it promises to open up new opportunities for researchin cognitive science and for designing new forms of humancomputerinteraction.How then do the parts of this program fit together The general idea is asfollows. Distributed cognition theory identifies a set of core principles thatwidely apply. For example,people establish and coordinate different types of structure in theirenvironmentit takes effort to maintain coordinationpeople offload cognitive effort to the environment whenever practicalthere are improved dynamics of cognitive loadbalancing available insocial organization.These principles serve to identify classes of phenomena that merit observation and documentation. Cognitive ethnography has methods for observing,documenting, and analyzing such phenomena, particularly informationflow, cognitive properties of systems, social organizations, and culturalprocesses. Because cognitive ethnography is an observational field, theinferences we would like to draw are at times underconstrained by theavailable data. In these cases, the findings of cognitive ethnography maysuggest ethnographically natural experiments to enrich our data.The principles of distributed cognition are also at play in these experiments because the point of experimentation should be to make more precisethe impact of changes in the naturally occurring parameters that theorytells us are important. As these three areasprinciples, ethnography, andexperimentare elaborated, they mutually constrain each other and offerprescriptive information on the design of work materials. To be sure, thematter is more complicated. Work materials are themselves part of workplaces, and themselves constitute important changes in the distributedcognition environment. So the introduction of a new work material is itselfFig. 1. Integrated research activity map.Distributed Cognition  181ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.a form of ethnographic experiment, which allows us to test and revise thetheory. But, in general, we give pride of place to the principles of distributed cognition, for it is these that inform experiment, ethnographic observation and design of work materials and workplaces.It is worth elaborating these relations. Consider how cognitive ethnography is used. Cognitive ethnography seeks to determine what things meanto the participants in an activity and to document the means by which themeanings are created. This is invariably revealing and often surprising.For example, in the world of aviation and ship navigation we have documented many cases of use of structure that were not anticipated by thedesigners of the tools involved. Experts often make opportunistic use ofenvironmental structure to simplify tasks. A simple example is that pilotsroutinely display the test pattern on the weather radar as a reminder thata final fuel transfer is in progress. There is no method other than observation that can discover these sorts of facts of behavior, and no other methodthat can teach us what really matters in a setting.In order to make realworld observations, it is necessary to establishrapport with the members of a community. While the skills required to dothis are not normally part of a curriculum in cognitive science, they are asessential as the methods of experimental design. Cognitive ethnographyfeeds distributed cognition theory by providing the corpus of observedphenomena that the theory must explain. Most cognitive theories seek toexplain experimental data. We believe there should be a single theory thatcovers cognition as it occurs in all settings. An experiment is, after all, justanother socially organized context for cognitive performance. This meansnot only that we look at socalled realworld settings, but that we lookdifferently at experiments, seeing them as settings in which people makeuse of a variety of material and social resources in order to produce sociallyacceptable behavior.While the study of cognition in the wild can answer many kinds ofquestions about the nature of human cognition in real workplaces, therichness of realworld settings places limits on the power of observationalmethods. This is where wellmotivated experiments come in. For instance,we recently observed that when children try to build a model using smallparts, they regularly modularized the problem in ways that were helpful atthe time but had to be dismantled later. This realworld problem solvinguses these parts to act out ideas, to help the child explore and understandthe problem. Having observed this in natural settings we can set aboutdesigning more constrained experiments which test specific aspects of thisexploratory behavior.Design enters the story in several ways. First, ethnography offers cleverways of getting things done that can be incorporated in new designs. Newuses can be found for old strategies, and techniques effective in one settingmay be transferred to another. Experiments can refine the theory ofdistributed cognition which in turn can be applied to improve design.Finally, since the design process creates new tools for workplaces, there arenew structures and interactions to study.182  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.This loop from observation to theory to design and back to new ethnographic observations is an important cycle of activity in our framework.The design process, by virtue of posing design decisions, may also revealnovel aspects of behavior that should be attended to by cognitive ethnography or experimental studies. This forms yet another cycle of activity thatcan be used to refine each element in turn as the elements of the cycleinteract with one another. The many loops and feedback circuits in theactivity map reflect the multiple iterative processes involved in the successive refinement of theory, methods, and products.Portions of the integrated approach have appeared in our previous work,but, to date, the entire activity has not been applied to a single problemdomain. In the following sections we summarize our earlier work on anumber of projects, and show in each case the overlapping subsets of theelements of the activity that were conducted, and the new opportunitiesthat are presented by assembling the complete integrated research system.3.1 Ship NavigationIn the 1980s, Hutchins did an extended cognitive ethnography of navigation aboard US Navy ships Hutchins 1995a Seifert and Hutchins 1992.The very notion of distributed cognition and the need for cognitive ethnography arose from the observation that the outcomes that mattered to theship were not determined by the cognitive properties of any single navigator, but instead were the product of the interactions of several navigatorswith each other and with a complex suite of tools. That work developeddistributed cognition theory and extended the methods of cognitive ethnography. It examined the history of navigation practice in two very differentcultural traditions to show how a single computational level of descriptioncould cover systems that had radically different representational assumptions and implementational means. It examined the details of tool use,showing how the cognitive processes required to manipulate a tool are notthe same as the computations performed by manipulating the tool. Itdocumented the social organization of work and showed how learninghappened both in individuals and at the organizational level.The integrated process we are proposing here could take that work muchfurther. The observations of the practices of navigation suggest experiments. For example, when accomplished navigators talk about bearingsexpressed in numbers of degrees, they often report, that in addition tothinking of the threedigit number, they feel a bearing as a direction inspace relative to the position of their body. A navigator facing northeastmay say that a bearing of 135 degrees true feels to be off to his right side.Some observed instances of navigators detecting errors appear to involvethis sort of crossmodal representation. Since error detection is a keycognitive property of this system, it would be nice to know how this actuallyworks. It is not possible to know from observation alone what role suchrepresentations might play in the navigation task. An experiment usingexpert subjects could shed light on this important process.Distributed Cognition  183ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.While Hutchins work on ship navigation did not include any designactivities, it could also be used as a basis for the design of electroniccharting tools an area of considerable interest to the Navy and the CoastGuard. An ethnography of the use of these new tools would be thebeginning of the next phase of the cycle of research activity.3.2 Airline Cockpit AutomationIn the late 1980s, Hutchins moved his primary field location from thebridges of ships to the cockpits of commercial airliners. Since then he andhis students have continued to refine the distributed cognition theory byapplying it to cockpit Hutchins 1995b Hutchins and Klausen 1996Hutchins and Palen 1997 and air traffic control Halverson 1995. Thiswork included an extensive cognitive ethnography of airline pilots including observations in the jumpseat of airliners in revenue flight, completionof training programs for stateoftheart airliners, and work with airlinetraining departments on the design of training programs. Based on atheoretical interpretation of the ethnographic findings, Hutchins designeda graphical interface to the autoflight functions of the Boeing 747400Hutchins 1996. That interface uses directmanipulation technology, originally developed in the STEAMER project Hollan et al. 1984, which is nownearly 20 years old. We now have the opportunity to apply the very latesttechnology to the problem of making the behavior of the autoflight systemvisible to the pilots.Based on the ethnographic study of the use of both conventional anddigital airspeed indicators, we have also designed a new digital airspeedtape. It takes advantage of the power of the computational mediumautomatic annotation of target airspeeds, acceleration indications, etc.,but also maintains the most useful features of the previous generation ofelectromechanical devices. Pilots using electromechanical airspeed indicators develop perceptual strategies that rely on the perceptual salience ofthe spatial location of the airspeed indicator needle in a space of meaningful speeds. Our new instrument not only preserves this property it makesit perceptually even more salient than was the case in the original. Thesedesign alternatives raise a number of important questions that can only beresolved by experimental investigation. For example, the ethnographicanalysis indicates that since pilots rarely read the airspeed as a number, itmay be possible for them to recover much of the information they need fromthe older designs without bringing the instrument into foveal vision. In ourintegrated approach, we are now in a position to complement the ethnographic, theoretic, and design activities with experimental investigations ofpilot eye movements while using the alternative designs.3.3 Beyond Direct ManipulationIt is possible to create virtual social and material environments that havedifferent properties than real environments. Hollan and Stornetta 1992discuss how an unquestioned presupposition of the efficacy of imitating184  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.facetoface communication restricts current humancomputer interactionwork on supporting informal communication. By paying close attention tohow people actually exploit real environments, and describing those phenomena in appropriate theoretical terms, we can see how to go beyond thesimple replication of felicitous features of the real world. An importantresearch issue for the field of humancomputer interaction is how to movebeyond current directmanipulation interfaces.One key focus of research based on distributed cognition is the nature ofrepresentations and the ways that people use representations to do work.Traditional information processing psychology focuses on symbols as tokensthat refer to something other than themselves, but pays little attention tostrategies people may develop to exploit the physical properties of therepresenting tokens themselves. Our cognitive ethnographies show us thatpeople often shift back and forth between attending to the properties of therepresentation and the properties of the thing represented, or intentionallyblur the two. These strategies of shifting in and out of the symbolic stancesupport some very interesting cognitive processing. For example, Hazlehurst 1994 studied Swedish fishermen who coordinate their actions withother boats in a pairtrawl by interpreting and talking about what appearson a falsecolor sonar display. They talk about seeing flecks and sprinkles,as well as fish. And they mix the two kinds of talk as in that fleck is denseenough to set the net upon.Hutchins and Palen 1997 looked at how a meaningfully constructedspace the flight engineers panel in a Boeing 727 airliner and gesture andspeech are all woven together in a brief cockpit episode in which the flightengineer explains to the captain and first officer that they have a fuel leak.He interacts with the panel both as if it is the fuel system it depicts, and, atother times, as if it is just a representation of the fuel system when heflicks a gauge with his finger to get the needle to move, for example. Theseshifts from attending to the representation to attending to the thingrepresented, whether in communication or in individual action, provide arange of cognitive outcomes that could not be achieved if representationswere always only taken as representations of something else, and not asthings in themselves.Given the primary role of representation in interfaces to computationalsystems, there are likely to be many opportunities to exploit such shifts.That is, it might be possible to do one kind of cognitive work on therepresentations as things in themselves and another kind of cognitive workinteracting with the representations as standins for the things theyrepresent. In directmanipulation interfaces the objects onscreen aremeant to be so closely coupled to the actual computational objects we aredealing with that we are supposed to feel as if we are manipulating the realobjects themselves and not just their standins. To achieve this feeling ofimmediacy Hutchins et al. 1985, it is essential that meaningful interfaceactions have meaningful counterparts in the system. Thus, in dragging anicon of a file from one folder to another we are not to think we are justmoving icons, but rather moving the actual folders and all their contents.Distributed Cognition  185ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.There are limits, however, to how well a representation can resemble thething it represents. For instance, many of the actions we perform on iconshave no meaningful correlate when we consider their referent. This isespecially true when we consider the way we can change the spatialrelations between icons. For example, when we move an image of a harddrive to a more convenient position on the screen where could we be movingthe real hard drive to Distributed cognition theory makes this otherwiseisolated observation an instance of an important class of events those inwhich people manipulate the properties of a representation to encodeinformation that does not pertain to and is not about the thing that therepresentation represents.Screen space often has no natural correlate in physical space. Thus whenwe rearrange the layout of directory windows, it makes no sense to askwhether we have brought those directories closer on the hard drive. Thescreen as desktop allows us to interpret such actions as analogous toshifting folders about on a flat desk, but folders can be made to pop in andout of existence, or to change in size, which again has no easy counterpartin the real world. The same applies when one changes the way files in adirectory are displayed. It is certainly conceivable that alphabetizing,sorting by recency, or sorting by size are actions that change the order inwhich files are written on a disk. But it is more plausible to think of theseas actions on the labels of files, not as actions on the files themselves.Because we manipulate icons in icon space it is possible to take advantage of the way they are displayed to help us further simplify our activity.We can opportunistically exploit structural possibilities of the interface.Files may be left near the trash can to remind us that we need to deletethem. Files that are to be used for a single project can be bunched together,or aliased so that they appear to be in two folders at once.As users become more familiar with an environment they situate themselves more profoundly. We believe that insights concerning the way agentsbecome closely coupled with their environments have yet to be fullyexploited in interface design. As we build richer, more allencompassingcomputational environments it becomes more important than ever tounderstand the ways human agents and their local environments aretightly coupled in the processing loops that result in intelligent action.Discovering new models of active representations is fundamental to thefuture of humancomputer interaction. Hollan et al. 1997 have proposedan informational physics model. Such models specify rules for how information presents and advertises itself and how it reacts to a changing environment. Changes can include the availability of alternative perceptual accessroutes, the presence of other informational entities, and the evolvingnature of users tasks, histories of interaction, and relationships with otherinformationstructuring entities.The research framework we proposed here and our previous theoretical,ethnographic, and design efforts lead one to address questions such asHow then can we design representations to facilitate their flexible use186  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.How can we make representations more active so that they help users seewhat is most relevant to deciding what to do nextHow can we shift the frame of interpretation so as to achieve a betterconceptualization of what is going on and what ought to be doneOne way to address each of these questions is to specifically focus oncreation of virtual social and material environments that go beyond mereimitation of the felicitous features of the real world to exploit the felicitousfeatures of a computational world.3.4 HistoryEnriched Digital ObjectsJust as computation can be used to create potentially more flexible andeffective active representations, it can also be used to allow representationsto record their history of use and make that history available in ways thatinform tasks and facilitate interaction. We think that automated gatheringof activity histories provides rich opportunities for pursuing the eventcentered ethnography we are proposing.In interaction with objects in the world, history of use is sometimesavailable to us in ways that inform our interactions with them. Forexample, a wellworn section of a door handle suggests where to grasp it. Anew paperback book opens to the place we last stopped reading. The mostrecently used pieces of paper occupy the tops of piles on our desk. Thephysics of the world is such that at times the histories of use are perceptually available to us in ways that support the tasks we are doing. While wecan mimic these mechanisms in interface objects, of potentially greatervalue is exploiting computation to develop new history of interactionmechanisms that dynamically change to reflect the requirements of different tasks.Studies of experts working in complex environments Hutchins 1995bhave shown that usehistories are sometimes incorporated in cognitivelyimportant processes. The side effects of use often provide resources for theconstruction of expert performance. Unfortunately, these supports forexpert performance are sometimes actively, but mistakenly, designed out ofclean and simple digital work environments. A striking example of thisis the cockpit of the Airbus A320 aircraft as discussed in Gras et al. 1991.By recognizing the functions of usehistories in simple media, we canexploit digital media to provide additional support in ways that are simplynot possible with static media.Digital objects can encode information about their history of use. Byrecording the interaction events associated with use of digital objects e.g.,reports, forms, source code, manual pages, email, spreadsheets it becomespossible to display graphical abstractions of the accrued histories as partsof the objects themselves. For example, we can depict on source code itscopy history so that developers can see that a particular section of code wascreated based on a copy of other code and thus perhaps be led to correct aDistributed Cognition  187ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.bug not only in code being debugged but also in the code from which it wasderived.In earlier efforts Hill et al. 1992, we explored the use of attributemapped scroll bars as a mechanism to make the history of interaction withdocuments and source code available. Hollan and his colleagues modifiedvarious editors to maintain detailed interaction histories. Among otherthings, they recorded who edited or read various sections of documents orcode as well as the length of time they took. Histories of those interactionswere graphically made available in the scroll bar. These graphical depictions identified and highlighted sections that had been edited and who hadedited them. Presenting this in the scroll bar made effective use of limiteddisplay real estate. To investigate any particular section, users need onlyclick on that section of the scroll bar. Similarly, we and others Eick et al.1992 have explored representing histories of interaction on source codeitself.We have also developed other applications of historyenriched digitalobjects Hill and Hollan 1994. For example, one can apply the idea tomenus so that the accrued history of menu choices of other users of asystem are indicated by making the more commonly used menu itemsbrighter. Or one can present spreadsheets such that the history of changesto items are graphically available, and thus sections of budgets currentlyundergoing modification are distinguished. We have also recorded the timespent in various editor buffers to enable visualizations of the activityhistories of tasks associated with those buffers.Records of the amount of time spent reading wire services, netnews,manual pages, and email messages can be shared to allow people to exploitthe history of others interactions. One can, for example, be directed tonews stories that significant others have spent considerable time readingor to individuals who have recently viewed a manual page that you arecurrently accessing. There are, of course, complex privacy issues involvedwith recording and sharing this kind of data. Such data, in our view, shouldbelong to users, and it should be their decision what is recorded and how itmight be shared. Encryption should be used to prevent data from beingobtained without the owners permission.The rich data resulting from recording histories of interaction andrequired to support active representations that conform to different usecontexts is a crucially important area of research and potential resourceupon which to base the design of future digital work environments. Theintegrated framework we propose here highlights the importance of ethnographic analysis of current use histories and encourages us to expand ourexploration of digital artifacts that capture their use histories. But capturing such histories is only the first step in being able to effectively exploitthem. The framework we are advocating suggests that we examine theactivities of those systems at multiple scales.188  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.3.5 PAD11 Zoomable Multiscale InterfacesThe observation that we move closer to items we wish to know more about,or that if we cannot get closer, we view them through magnifying optics, isso commonplace that it seems unworthy of mention. Yet, this simple andpowerful idea can be exploited in computational media in ways that othermedia do not allow.Pad11 Bederson and Hollan 1994 Bederson et al. 1996 is an experimental software system to support exploration of dynamic multiscaleinterfaces. It is part of our research program to move beyond mimicking themechanisms of earlier media to more effectively exploit computationalmechanisms. It provides a generalpurpose substrate for creating andinteracting with structured information based on a zoomable interface.Pad11 workspaces are large in extent and resolution, allowing objects tobe placed at any location and at any size. Zooming and panning aresupported as the fundamental interaction techniques.Pad11 provides multiscale interface development facilities. These include portals to support multiple views, lenses to filter and furnish alternative views, search techniques to allow one to find information thatmatches selected characteristics and easily move to it, history markers andhypertext links to support navigation, layout and animation facilities, andother experimental multiscale interface techniques and tools.While Pad11 provides a powerful substrate for creating multiscale workmaterials, here we mention only one example. PadPrints Hightower et al.1998 is a Pad11 application linked with Netscape that functions as anavigation aid for webbased browsing. As a user follows links in thebrowser, a multiscale map of the history of traversals is maintained byPadPrints. The graphical views of pages can be used to select previouslyvisited pages and are ideal candidates for visually representing the historyofuse information mentioned earlier. As a navigation aid, PadPrints exploits multiscale facilities for both representation and interaction. We haveshown it to be more effective than traditional browsers Hightower et al.1998 in a variety of common information search tasks.Informationintensive workplaces can be naturally viewed within a multiscale space. Dynamic multiscale spaces are particularly appropriate forhierarchical information because items that are deeper in the hierarchy canbe made smaller, yet because they are still in view they can easily beaccessed by zooming. Similarly, the time structure of many informationbased tasks is hierarchical in nature and fits well with multiscale representations.Embedding Pad11 research within the distributedcognition frameworkwe propose here has important consequences. It helps us realize that someof what is powerful about multiscale representations comes from howindividuals and groups adapt. As we discuss below, careful observationdemonstrates that we constantly adapt to our environments at differentspatiotemporal scales. Individually we adapt through interaction and creating scaffolding collectively we adapt through culture and intelligentDistributed Cognition  189ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.coordination. The very flexible multiscale representations that Pad11makes possible allow us to explore representations that might better fitthese differing spatiotemporal scales.Distributed cognition encourages us to look at functional organizationsthat soften traditional boundaries between what is inside and what isoutside. Because of the highly interactive nature of Pad11 interfaces thereis a rich interplay of cognitive processing, activity structure, and dynamicrepresentational changes. How people manipulate the multiscale space andthe multiscale objects within it is of particular interest. For example, whenusing PadPrints, users sometimes discover that nodes at a particular levelof the navigation map correspond to classes of events in the search activity.Similarly, a characteristic structure accrues to pages that users return tofrequently to follow other links. The fact that the interface creates structure that can be interpreted in this way may suggest new task decompositions to the user or may support alternative strategies for the allocation ofeffort in the activity. Distributed cognition encourages exploration of thetight coupling of interface components and cognition. Better understandingof this coupling may help in explaining why zoomable multiscale interfacesseem so compelling and assist in effective design of alternative multiscalerepresentations. The integrated framework encourages us to augmentexperimental evaluation of Pad11 with ethnographic analyses, not only ofusage patterns, but also of the general navigation activities people exploitin dealing with emergent structure in dynamic information displays.3.6 Intelligent Use of SpaceIn observing peoples behavior in Pad11 it is apparent that how theymanipulate icons, objects, and emergent structure is not incidental to theircognition it is part of their thinking process, part of the distributed processof achieving cognitive goals. They leave certain portals open to remindthem of potentially useful information or to keep changes nicely visualizedthey shift objects in size to emphasize their relative importance and theymove collections of things in and out of their primary workspace when theywant to keep certain information around but have other concerns that aremore pressing.Studies of planning and activity have typically focused on the temporalordering of action, but we think it is important to also explore questionsabout where agents lay down instruments, ingredients, workinprogress,and the like. For in having a body, we are spatially located creatures wemust always be facing some direction, have only certain objects in view, bewithin reach of certain others. Whether we are aware of it or not, we areconstantly organizing and reorganizing our workplace to enhance performance. Space is a resource that must be managed, much like time, memory,and energy. Accordingly we predicted that when space is used well itreduces the time and memory demands of our tasks, and increases thereliability of execution and the number of jobs we can handle at once.In Kirsh 1995 we classified the functions of space into three maincategories spatial arrangements that simplify choice, spatial arrangements190  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.that simplify perception, and spatial dynamics that simplify internalcomputation. The data for such a classification was drawn from videos ofcooking, assembly, and packing, from everyday observations in supermarkets, workshops, and playrooms, and from experimental studies of subjectsplaying Tetris, the computer game. The studies, therefore, focused oninteractive processes in the medium and short term on how agents set uptheir workplace for particular tasks, and how they continuously managethat workplace.As with many such studies it is not easy to summarize our findings,though our main conjecture was strongly confirmed. In several environments we found subjects using space to simplify choice by creating arrangements that served as heuristic cues. For instance, we saw them coveringthings, such as garbage disposal units or hot handles, thereby hidingcertain affordances or signaling a warning and so constraining what wouldbe seen as feasible. At other times they would highlight affordances byputting items needing immediate attention near to them, or creating pilesthat had to be dealt with. We saw them lay down items for assembly in away that was unambiguously encoding the order in which they were to beput together or handed off. That is, they were using space to encodeordering information and so were offloading memory. These are just a fewof the techniques we saw them use to make their decision problemscombinatorially less complex.We also found subjects reorganizing their workspace to facilitate perception to make it possible to notice properties or categories that were notnoticed before, to make it easier to find relevant items, to make it easier forthe visual system to track items. One subject explained how his fathertaught him to place the various pieces of his dismantled bicycle, many ofwhich were small, on a sheet of newspaper. This made the small pieceseasier to locate and less likely to be kicked about. In videos of cooking wefound chefs distinguishing otherwise identical spoons by placing thembeside key ingredients or on the lids of their respective saucepans, therebyusing their positions to differentiate or mark them. We found jigsawpuzzlers grouping similar pieces together, thereby exploiting the capacityof the visual system to note finer differences between pieces when surrounded by similar pieces than when surrounded by different pieces.Finally, we found a host of ways that embodied agents enlist the world toperform computation for them. Familiar examples of such offloading showup in analog computations. When the tallest spaghetti noodle is singled outfrom its neighbors by striking the bundle on a table, a sort computation isperformed by using the material and spatial properties of the world. Butmore prosaically we have found in laboratory studies of the computer gameTetris that players physically manipulate forms to save themselves computational effort Kirsh 2001 Kirsh and Maglio 1995. They modify theenvironment to cue recall, to speed up identification, and to generatemental images faster than they could if unaided. In short, they makechanges to the world to save themselves costly and potentially errorpronecomputations.Distributed Cognition  191ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.All the work we have discussed above points to one fact people form atightly coupled system with their environments. The environment is onespartner or cognitive ally in the struggle to control activity. Although mostof us are unaware of it, we constantly create external scaffolding to simplifyour cognitive tasks. Helpful workflow analyses must focus on how, when,and why this external scaffolding is created. We think an integratedresearch environment such as we propose is absolutely crucial to suchanalyses and as foundation for creating digital environments which makethese cognitive alliances as powerful as possible.4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONSHumancomputer interaction as a field began at a time in which humaninformation processing psychology was the dominant theory and stillreflects that lineage. The human information processing approach explicitly took an early conception of the digital computer as the primarymetaphorical resource for thinking about cognition. Just as it focused onidentifying the characteristics of individual cognition, humancomputerinteraction, until very recently, has focused almost exclusively on singleindividuals interacting with applications derived from decompositions ofwork activities into individual tasks. This theoretical approach has dominated humancomputer interaction for over 20 years, playing a significantrole in developing a computing infrastructure built around the personalcomputer and based on the desktop interface metaphor.For humancomputer interaction to advance in the new millennium weneed to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in whichthe focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into acomplex networked world of information and computermediated interactions. A central image for us is that of future work environments in whichpeople pursue their goals in collaboration with elements of the social andmaterial world. We think that to accomplish this will require a newtheoretical basis and an integrated framework for research.Here we propose distributed cognition as a theoretical foundation forhumancomputer interaction research. Distributed cognition, developedover the past 12 years, is specifically tailored to understanding interactionsamong people and technology. The central hypothesis is that the cognitiveand computational properties of systems can be accounted for in terms ofthe organization and propagation of constraints. This theoretical characterization attempts to free research from the particulars of specific cases butstill capture important constituents of interactions among people andbetween people and material artifacts.Taking a distributed cognition perspective radically alters the way welook at humancomputer interaction. In the traditional view, somethingspecial happens at the boundary of the individual cognitive system. Traditional information processing psychology posits a gulf between inside andoutside and then bridges this gulf with transduction processes thatconvert external events into internal symbolic representations. The impli192  J. Hollan et al.ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.cation of this for HCI is that the computer and its interface are outside ofcognition and are only brought inside through symbolic transduction seeCard et al. 1983. Distributed cognition does not posit a gulf betweencognitive processes and an external world, so it does not attempt toshow how such a gulf could be bridged. Moving the boundary of the unit ofcognitive analysis out allows us to see that other things are happeningthere. Cognitive processes extend across the traditional boundaries asvarious kinds of coordination are established and maintained betweeninternal and external resources. Symbolic transduction is only one ofmyriad forms of coordination that may develop between a user and afeature of a computer system.We propose an integrated framework for research that combines ethnographic observation and controlled experimentation as a basis for theoretically informed design of digital work materials and collaborative workplaces. The framework makes a deep commitment to the importance ofobservation of human activity in the wild and analysis of distributions ofcognitive processes. In particular it suggests we focus on distributions ofcognitive processes across members of social groups, coordination betweeninternal and external structure, and how products of earlier events cantransform the nature of later events.This integrated approach strongly suggests that humancomputer interaction research should begin in ethnographic studies of the phenomena ofinterest and with natural histories of the representations employed bypractitioners. This in turn suggests that researchers must have a deeperunderstanding of the domains involved in order to, among other things,allow them to act as participant observers as well as to be theoretically andmethodologically positioned to see existing functional organizations. Theframework we propose holds that grounding in cognitive ethnography andintegration of ethnographic methods with normal experimental analysis isfundamental to effective iterative evolution of interfaces. This frameworkalso suggests that there are important opportunities available for designingand building systems that capture and exploit histories of usage. Suchhistories can not only be the basis for assisting users but also, with privacyconcerns adequately addressed, provide researchers and developers withcrucially important continuing data streams to assist future development.As we mentioned earlier, the integrated research program described inthis article does not yet exist. We realize that it is quite ambitious in scopeand in the skills demanded. The issues to be addressed are complex.Strategic advances will require considerable coordination of research activities on a scale not now associated with the field of humancomputerinteraction. In addition, graduate training programs will need to be expanded to incorporate training in a wider array of research skills. As a stepin that direction, we have recently joined together to form a new researchlaboratory, Distributed Cognition and HumanComputer Interaction Laboratory, and are designing a graduate education and research trainingprogram for humancomputer interaction based on the theory of distributedcognition. As part of that effort we are embarking on a research enterpriseDistributed Cognition  193ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 2, June 2000.Hollan et al. 1998 coordinated by the integrated framework we havedescribed. We will need to await the results of these ventures to betterunderstand the consequences of putting into practice what we propose.Still, we hope it is clear that without theories that view humancomputerinteraction within larger sociotechnical contexts and without a theoretically based research framework that integrates ethnographic and experimental approaches, it is unlikely the field of humancomputer interactionwill do justice to designing the intellectual workplaces of the future andensuring that they meet human needs.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe development of this article has benefited from many discussions withmembers of our research group Dan Bauer, Aaron Cicourel, Ian Fasel,Deborah Forster, David Fox, Mike Hayward, Jonathan Helfman, RonHightower, Barbara Holder, Sam Horodezky, Terry Jones, Todd Kaprielian,Tim Marks, Jonathan Nelson, Thomas Rebotier, Ron Stanonik, Scott Stornetta, and Peg Syverson.REFERENCESAGAR, M. 1986.
