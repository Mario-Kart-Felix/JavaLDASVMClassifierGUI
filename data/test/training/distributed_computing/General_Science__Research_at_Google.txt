Many scientific endeavors can benefit from large scale experimentation, data gathering, and machine learning (including deep learning). We aim to accelerate scientific research by applying Googleâ€™s computational power and techniques in areas such as drug discovery, biological pathway modeling, microscopy, medical diagnostics, material science, and agriculture. We collaborate closely with world class research partners to help solve important problems with large scientific or humanitarian benefit. 114 Publications       A Costâ€“Benefit Study of Text Entry Suggestion Interaction Philip Quinn , Shumin Zhai Proceedings of the 2016 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, ACM, New York, NY, pp. 83-88       A cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of information processing during memory consolidation Rothschild Gideon, Elad Eban , Loren Frank Nature (2016)       Carrier Recovery in Coherent Optical Communication Systems Xiang Zhou Wiley (2016)     Communication and Collaboration in SRE Niall Richard Murphy , Alex Rodriguez, Carl Crous, Dario Freni , Dylan Curley, Lorenzo Blanco, Todd Underwood, Betsy Beyer Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems, O'Reilly (2016)     Lessons Learned from Other Industries Jennifer Petoff , Betsy Beyer Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems, O'Reilly (2016)       Molecular graph convolutions: moving beyond fingerprints Steven Kearnes, Kevin McCloskey, Marc Berndl, Vijay Pande, Patrick Riley Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design (2016), pp. 1-14     Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure John Lunney, Sue Lueder, Gary O' Connor Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems, O'Reilly (2016)       SAC079 - SSAC Advisory on the Changing Nature of IPv4 Address Semantics Warren Kumari , Don Blumenthal, Russ Mundy ICANN Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC) Reports and Advisories, ICANN (2016), pp. 17       SWIFT: Using task-based parallelism, fully asynchronous communication, and graph partition-based domain decomposition for strong scaling on more than 100000 cores.
