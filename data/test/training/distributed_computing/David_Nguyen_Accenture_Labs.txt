New Frontiers in Telepresence Gina Venolia Microsoft Research ginavmicrosoft.com Kori Inkpen Microsoft Research korimicrosoft.com Judy Olson UC Irvine jsolsonuci.edu David Nguyen Accenture Labs david.t.nguyenaccenture.com ABSTRACT Telepresence technology has only begun to scratch the surface of how people establish a sense of shared presence and space among separated members of a group. Attempting to broaden our current, limited conceptions of telepresence may uncover many new opportunities for telepresence innovation. This workshop, using a soapbox madness approach, will identify major topics that break out of current, limited conceptions of telepresence to spur new technology ideas.

INTRODUCTION In 1992 Bill Buxton coined the term telepresence, defining it as the use of technology to establish a sense of shared presence or shared space among separated members of a group 1.  In the mid1990s Microsofts NetMeeting became the first widelydistributed client for telepresence, including voice, video, whiteboardlike drawing, application and screensharing.  Subsequently these features became even more widely available as they were integrated into instantmessaging clients.  Skype arrived in 2006 and extended the prevalence of two and multiparty videoconferencing even more broadly.  Webcams are a popular computer accessory and have increasingly been integrated directly into laptop and desktop monitors.  Companies such as Polycom, Tandberg and LifeSize have raised the quality of the audiovisual experience.  Cisco and HP have pushed the quality to new levels.  Mobile phones with frontfacing cameras are poised to make videoconferencing mobile and ubiquitous.  Telepresence, or at least realtime streaming of sound, video and computer screens, is a fait accompli  or so it might seem. We believe that the academic community and the marketplace have only scratched the surface of telepresence, and that theres a lot of deep digging left to do.  In particular we believe that the current conception of telepresence solely as a videoconference meeting misses many opportunities for innovation. One limitation of our current conception of telepresence is that our community tends to think of a meeting as a monolithic thing.  But in reality meetings are varied and diverse in many ways the number of people, the topology of distribution, the goals of the meeting, the history and relationships among the participants, etc.  All of these facets imply a diversity of requirements on the meetings.  How can understanding the particular needs of specific types and attributes of meetings spur technological innovation Another limitation of our conception is that we think of telepresence as what happens during a distributed meeting or call  minutes through hours.  But interactions among a pair or group of people span days, months, or years.  How does the suite of telepresence experiences play out in the long term  How could they change to better support desired longterm effects  How does telepresence dovetail with other media, such as facetoface, IM, email, file sharing, etc., and support conversations that flow across media  How does telepresence contribute to relationshipbuilding This oneday workshop will bring together people who are passionate about breaking out of the box of telepresenceasvideoconference to inspire and crosspollinate ideas. The goal of this workshop is an indepth exchange of ideas.  The workshop will be limited to 12 participants plus the four organizers.  The organizers will distribute hardcopies of the position papers at least two weeks before the event.  All participants are expected to read them beforehand. To go beyond the immediate goal of exchanging ideas among the workshop participants, the organizers will summarize the results of the workshop as an article, which will be submitted to Interactions magazine.  The structure and content of the article will be drawn from the discussions at the workshop.  The workshop participants will be acknowledged in the article submission. We will recruit three CSCW attendees to act as scribes.  The scribes will not be active participants in the meeting.   Copyright is held by the authorowners. CSCW 2010, February 610, 2010, Savannah, Georgia, USA ACM  97816055879501002.  We use the word telepresence in Buxtons sense of group work, not in the sense of teleoperation.621We will compensate the scribes by paying for their conference registration fees.   We will recruit the scribes in the workshop CFP and through networking with our academic colleagues. WORKSHOP ACTIVITIES The Soapbox Madness is a series of brief discussions on topics presented by the workshop participants and organizers themselves.  In the Call for Participation below we ask that you submit a few topics that are important to you.  During the workshop each participant will be given one minute to present a soapbox topic no slides and then four minutes to lead a discussion on the topic.  The point of Soapbox Madness is not to present your research that comes later in the day but to get people thinking. During the position paper presentations all participants and organizers will be given five minutes to present his position paper, followed by four minutes for questions and discussion.  We may adjust the timing to accommodate the number participants. A video projector will be provided. During lunch the organizers, and any participants who wish to participate, will perform a card sort on the topics raised during the Soapbox Madness and position papers in order to identify three leading topics.  Participants will selfselect into three breakout sessions.  The first half of the breakout session will be used for general discussion and ideation about the topic during the second, the participants will outline the concepts they discussed. CALL FOR PARTICIPATION If you are interested in participating in this workshop you must submit a position paper describing your work in progress and 15 soapbox topics by email.  Your position paper should be no longer than 4 printed pages.  You may use the ACM template if you like.  Your submission should be emailed in a common format e.g. PDF, Word or HTML. For your soapbox topics, think of the things about telepresence that are driving you, motivating you, irritating you or capturing your imagination.  Think of grand challenges, little tweaks and everything in between.  Your soapbox topics should be aimed at starting a conversation.  You may find it helpful to phrase them as questions.  Write down just a few sentences for up to five soapbox topics, and include them in the email when you submit your position paper. The workshop organizers will review the position papers and soapbox topics for pertinence to the workshop theme, general interest and quality.
