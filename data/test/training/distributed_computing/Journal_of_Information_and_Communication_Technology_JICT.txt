This journal covers all aspects of information and communication technology, its theories and applications. The aim of this journal is to provide coverage of the most significant research and development in the area of information and communication technology. To be accepted, a paper must be judged to be truly out standing in its field and to be of interest to a wide audience. We are particularly interested in work at the boundaries, both the boundaries of subdisciplines of information and communication technology and the boundaries between information and communication technology and other fields. This is an open access journal. The articles on this site are available in full-text and free of charge to our web visitors. Journal of Information and Communication Technology (JICT) is abstracted and indexed in: •             SCOPUS •             EBSCOhost •             Malaysian Citation Index (MyCite), •             DOAJ (Directory of Open Access Journals) •             Islamic World Science Citation Centre. •             UDLedge Social Science & Humanities Citation Index (SS&HCI) and Focus (Journals and Conference Proceedings) Journal of Information and Communication Technology (JICT) recipient of Ministry of Higher Education’s CREAM Award 2016.
