The interconnection network is an important component of a parallel processing system. A good interconnection network should have less topological network cost and meanwhile keep the network diameter as shorter as possible 2.  The mesh is a network with constant node degree in its internal nodes where as torus network has constant node degree with all its nodes 13. The advantages of torus network can be imposed on to the mesh embedded hypercube network 4, 5 to give rise to an embedded architecture 68 called torus embedded hypercube scalable interconnection network and hence an architectural enhancement of mesh embedded hypercube network. In this paper, we have described about the torus embedded hypercube network 9. Also it has been proved how efficient a torus embedded hypercube interconnection network compared to the existing mesh embedded hypercube interconnection network. 2.ARCHITECTURAL PROPERTIES Let l  m be the size of several concurrent torus networks and N be the number of nodes connected in hypercube configuration in it. Several hypercube connections can be derived from such group of N nodes within the torus configuration 9, 10 as shown in Figure 1. With this torus embedded hypercube network can be labeled as a network of size  l, m, N.   Figure 1. A 2, 2, 8  Torus embedded hypercube network N.

Hence, a l, m, Ntorus embedded hypercube network will have        l  m  N number of nodes and a node will be addressed as i, j, k where 0  i  l, 0  j  m and 0  k  N.

In Figure1, the ring connections of rowcolumn of each torus are not shown for simplicity and without that the network will be a 2, 2, 8mesh embedded hypercube network. A wraparound connection is done along each rowcolumn of the mesh if they have same label in Figure1 to deduce it to 2, 2, 8torus embedded hypercube network. Scalability of a network 4, 5 is defined as the property by which the size of the system can be expanded with nominal changes in the existing configuration provided that system expansion results with improvement in performance. The torus embedded hypercube network is highly scalable network. 3.COMPARISON OF RESULTS AND DISCUSSION For the analysis and comparison purpose we have considered network metrics such as Network Diameter and Topological Network cost. The diameter of a network can be defined as maximum number of hops an average message takes to reach to its destination 4, 9, 10. The topological cost of a network depends on its node degree and diameter. A network with less node degree usually will have a large diameter, and a network with fewer diameters will possess larger node degree. Consequently, a network with large degree contains a large number of links while a network with low degree contains a small number of links 4. 3.1Network Diameter Analysis If the diameter is too large, it implies that a large number of nodes  Table 1. Comparison of Network Diameter  will have to be busy to get connected to the destination node. In other words, the message from source to destination will have to pass through larger number of intermediate nodes. This in turn brings down the performance of the whole system and hence system may slow down. In the results given in Table 1 and Figure 2, as far as the network diameter is concerned, the torus embedded hypercube network needs lesser network diameter to get connected between a source node and a destination node. Hence the torus embedded hypercube network is much superior than mesh embedded hypercube network as far as performance metrics is concerned and much faster than an equivalent mesh embedded hypercube network.  Figure 2. Network diameter analysis 3.2Network Cost Analysis The topological network cost analysis result is given in Table 2 and Figure 3.  Table 2. Comparison of Topological Network Cost  2010 International Journal of Computer Applications 0975  8887  Volume 1  No. 4 34   Figure 3. Network cost analysis Topology is the study of connectivity and continuity.  It is seen that the torus embedded hypercube network will have low network cost. Though the network diameter is found to be increasing in l, m, 16torus embedded hypercube network, it has to be noted that the torus embedded hypercube has better values for network cost as the system is scaled up. 4.CONCLUSION We have analyzed a torus embedded hypercube interconnection network and compared its network parameters with mesh embedded hypercube interconnection network for a parallel architecture. Network metrics such as network diameter and topological network cost are considered since they are the most important parameters to justify the efficiency of the network.  It is necessary to come up with a network that is scalable, minimum network diameter and a minimum topological cost. All afore mentioned requirements are met by the torus embedded hypercube network and hence it can supersede the mesh embedded hypercube network. The results show that torus embedded hypercube network is much faster than the mesh embedded hypercube in terms of communication. Hence this network could be chosen as interconnection network for parallel architecture. 5.APPENDIX To provide the basic principles, we have considered simple torus and hypercube networks with their data routing functions to show the connectivity among the nodes. The data routing functions as in 1.a to 1.d of torus network 1 are   1.d               , 1  1.c                 , 1  1.b              1    1.a                  1    4321jl modilj i,Tjl modij i,Tm modjmi,j i,Tm modji,j i,Twhere i and j are row and column numbers respectively.   According to these data routing functions, the various permutation cycles can be generated for a 2  2 torus network shown in Figure 4.  Figure 4.
