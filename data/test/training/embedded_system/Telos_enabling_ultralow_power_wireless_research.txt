Telos Enabling UltraLow Power Wireless ResearchJoseph Polastre, Robert Szewczyk, and David CullerComputer Science DepartmentUniversity of California, BerkeleyBerkeley, CA 94720polastre,szewczyk,cullercs.berkeley.eduAbstract We present Telos, an ultra low power wireless sensor modulemote for research and experimentation. Telos is the latest in a lineof motes developed by UC Berkeley to enable wireless sensor networkWSN research. It is a new mote design built from scratch based on experiences with previous mote generations. Telos new design consists of threemajor goals to enable experimentation minimal power consumption, easyto use, and increased software and hardware robustness. We discuss howhardware components are selected and integrated in order to achievethese goals. Using a Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller, ChipconIEEE 802.15.4compliant radio, and USB, Telos power profile is almostonetenth the consumption of previous mote platforms while providinggreater performance and throughput. It eliminates programming andsupport boards, while enabling experimentation with WSNs in both lab,testbed, and deployment settings.I. INTRODUCTIONWireless sensor networks are ideally suited for longlived applications deployed at large densities for low cost. Unfortunately, thecurrent WSN platforms built from commercial offtheshelf COTScomponents have a lifetime of no more than two years, communicatethrough nonstandard interfaces, are expensive, and are difficult touse for experimentation, development, testing, and deployment.In this paper, we introduce the design of Telos, the latest wirelesssensor device, or mote, from the University of California, Berkeley.Telos shown in Figure 1 is a new design to further research in sensornetworks with three major goals lower power operation than previousmote generations, easy to use, and robustness for experimentationand deployment. The Telos design is based on the following lowduty cycle principle the node is asleep for the majority of the time,wakes up quickly on an event, processes, and returns to sleep. Forthe lowest power consumption, the standby current and wakeup timetime to transition from sleep to active mode must be minimized 1since the the active portion of a sensor network application istypically extremely small 2. Telos offers more than just low poweroperation through its integrated design. Integration of programming,communication, storage, and sensing allows researchers to utilizemore functionality and develop more robust systems.II. RELATED WORKThe lineage of current platforms can be traced back to a numberof devices called COTS motes built by the SmartDust projectand shown in Figure 2. These devices were built to approximatethe capabilities of an envisioned SmartDust node with off the shelfcomponents 3. These designs used a small 8bit microcontrollers 4to 8 kB of flash, 512 bytes of RAM a simple radio OOK modulationat 4kbps and integrated sensors magnetometers, accelerometers,temperature, pressure, etc. Later designs weC 4, and Reneexposed a custom sensor interface and allowed for the possibilityof remote reprogramming.Mica 5, released in 2001, was carefully designed to serveas a general purpose platform for WSN research. Compared withpreceding designs, it offered more memory 4kB of RAM and 128kBof flash, extensive sensor interfaces 8 analog lines, several digital IOFig. 1. Telos ultralow power wireless module mote with IEEE 802.15.4wireless transceiver.channels, dedicated serial busses, and a very flexible radio interface.Mica used the RFM TR1000 and simple modulation techniques. Theradios primitive interfaces allowed low power operation and quickturnon times. The unbuffered, bitlevel radio interface connected toseveral IO pins, interrupts, and an SPI bus on the main microcontroller the bus timing was controlled by the CPU clock. Researchersimplemented a number of schemes for radio wakeup, low powerasynchronous communications, fairly high bandwidth protocols 40kHz physical layer, and precise time synchronization to within a 1bit time.Mica was useful for development, but unsuitable for deployments.The boost converter provided a stable voltage but used excess quiescent current. The radio communication range was short and relativelyunreliable. The extensive IO connector was not robust to variations intemperature 6. Mica2, the follow on to the Mica platform, correctedmany shortcomings the boost converter was discarded, and the MCUwas replaced with the ATmega128. This lowered the Mica2 standbycurrent to about 17A, while waking up the system takes up to 4 ms ifusing the external crystal. The radio transceiver was replaced with theChipcon CC1000 offering tunable frequencies from 300 to 900 MHzand FSK modulation resilient to noise. The radio exposed a bytelevelinterface and timing interrupts. Although more resilient, the Mica2had higher energy per bit and an order of magnitude higher wakeuptime. Despite these shortcomings, Mica2 and the smaller Mica2Dotare the de facto standard research platforms in WSN research 16of 21 papers in SenSys 2004 used Mica2 for evaluation. MicaZ 7continues the evolution of the Mica family it replaces the CC1000radio with a CC2420, an IEEE 802.15.4 compatible radio.A single chip mote implementation called Spec 8 resulted fromanalyzing the Mica platform. Just 5mm2 in size, Spec uses a numberof dedicated hardware accelerators to perform programmable start07803920190520.00 2005 IEEE 364Mote Type WeC Rene Rene2 Dot Mica Mica2Dot Mica 2 TelosYear 1998 1999 2000 2000 2001 2002 2002 2004MicrocontrollerType AT90LS8535 ATmega163 ATmega128 TI MSP430Program memory KB 8 16 128 48RAM KB 0.5 1 4 10Active Power mW 15 15 8 33 3Sleep Power W 45 45 75 75 15Wakeup Time s 1000 36 180 180 6Nonvolatile storageChip 24LC256 AT45DB041B ST M25P80Connection type I2C SPI SPISize KB 32 512 1024CommunicationRadio TR1000 TR1000 CC1000 CC2420Data rate kbps 10 40 38.4 250Modulation type OOK ASK FSK OQPSKReceive Power mW 9 12 29 38Transmit Power at 0dBm mW 36 36 42 35Power ConsumptionMinimum Operation V 2.7 2.7 2.7 1.8Total Active Power mW 24 27 44 89 41Programming and Sensor InterfaceExpansion none 51pin 51pin none 51pin 19pin 51pin 16pinCommunication IEEE 1284 programming and RS232 requires additional hardware USBIntegrated Sensors no no no yes no no no yesFig. 2.

A simple FSKradio uses a number of unusual structures e.g. digital frequencylockloops to reduce startup times and active power, while stillproviding the frequency agility and improved resistance to noise. TheCPU has been optimized to reduce the cost of context switching.Specs performance is over 1000 times better than Mica in manyapplications. Unlike the Mica family, Spec is fully integrated andoffers limited interface flexibility. Since it is a research project, it isunlikely to become available in quantities to the research community.Spec provides significant advantages in power consumption dueto its integrated design and hardware accelerators. The Telos designparallels that of Spec instead of integrating the design into silicon,Telos uses COTS components with hardware accelerators to build apower efficient system that does not sacrifice performance.III. TELOS PLATFORMWe discuss the design and implementation of Telos, including theintuition behind hardware selection. We offer an analysis of Telosand existing devices and provide a discussion of research enabled bythe Telos platform.The Telos platform is the result of over 12 months of researchand development by two fulltime graduate students, and numerouscollaborator, at the University of California, Berkeley. Telos is acompletely new design based off experiences from using previousmote generations designed by former graduate students at Berkeleyand researchers at other institutions Intel, ETH Zurich, etc.... Wediscuss how we achieve the three major goals for Telos ultralowpower operation, easy to use, and robust hardware and softwareimplementation.A. Technological TrendsSince the Mica2 mote was released in 2002, a number of new microcontrollers have been introduced offering lower power consumption, more onchip peripherals, and various RAM and flash sizes.Our low power principle focuses on reducing the sleep current andwakeup time of our system. Figure 4 summarizes the microcontrollerimprovements over time.For Telos, we chose the MSP430 microcontroller after evaluatingexisting products from Atmel, Motorola, and Microchip. Figure 4shows that the MSP430 has the lowest power consumption in sleepand active modes. The microcontroller operates down to 1.8V. Lowvoltages are important for extracting all of the energy out of apower sourcee.g., AA batteries have a cutoff voltage of 0.9V. Iftwo batteries are used in series, the system cutoff voltage is 1.8V,exactly the same as the minimum required voltage for the MSP430. Incontrast, the ATmega128 MCU Mica family will only run down to2.7V, leaving almost 50 of the AA batteries unused. The MSP430also has the fastest wakeup time of any microcontroller transitioningfrom standby 1A to active mode 8MHz in no more than 6s.The MSP430 has a DMA controller to reduce load from the MCUcore, lower power consumption, and increase performance.The trend is to keep the RAM and Flash sizes constant shownin Figure 4 while adding additional hardware accelerator modules.The MSP430 provides us with the largest onchip RAM buffer10kB, useful for onchip signal processing. Larger RAM buffersenable more sophisticated applicationsfor example, Mate 9 canuse extended RAM to support more execution contexts and largerprogram images TinyDB 10 uses larger RAM storage for innetwork aggregation and data table storage. Larger flash storage,although useful for large applications, has not been the limiting factorin developing WSN applications to date.There are two distinct types of low power, low data rate radiosnarrowband and wideband radios as shown in Figure 3. Many narrowband radios provide very fast startup times since they are clocked bythe MCU but have simple modulation schemes, no spreading codes,and are not robust to noise. Wideband radios must wait for highspeed oscillators to start. Enhanced modulation schemes found inwideband radios, such as spread spectrum DSSS and phase shiftkeying OQPSK, provide signal robustness to noise and interference. Narrowband radios typically operate at lower frequencies andlower data rates wideband radios typically operate in the 2.4GHzband and provide higher data rates. To pick the most applicableradio, we must evaluate the impact of noise, flexibility available tothe end application, ease of communication with other devices, power07803920190520.00 2005 IEEE 365Type Narrowband WidebandVendor RFM Chipcon Chipcon Nordic Chipcon Motorola ZeevoPart no.

Microcontroller history The main table contains traditional microcontrollers the bottom two devices are 32bit microprocessors presented forcomparison.consumption, startup times, and available data bandwidth. Figure 3provides a summary of common radio features. No single radio inFigure 3 is globally optimal instead a radio must be chosen basedon application requirements.For Telos, we chose to use the new IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Byusing a standardized radio, Telos can communicate with any numberof devices sharing the same physical layer, including devices fromother vendors. The primary factor in selecting a radio technologywas the desire experiment with the new IEEE 802.15.4 wirelesstechnology. Telos uses the Chipcon CC2420 radio in the 2.4GHzband, a wideband radio with OQPSK modulation with DSSS at250kbps. The higher data rate allows shorter active periods furtherreducing energy consumption. The radio crystal used on Telos wascarefully chosen to be a lowESR 16MHz crystal low resistance isessential for minimizing the startup time of the crystal and thusminimizing wasted energy, The Telos crystal yields a 580s startuptime, almost 300s lower than the minimum advertised startup timeby Chipcon.Since IEEE 802.15.4 radio interfaces are packetbased, we loseconsiderable flexibility in software for controlling the radios operation. The CC2420 provides a number of hardware accelerators toachieve better performance. These include encryption and authentication, packet handling support, auto acknowledgments, and addressdecoding. Since hardware accelerators are embedded in the radioinstead of the microcontroller, the accelerators may not be usedas general purpose functions. For example, a data buffer may beencrypted and stored in flash, however since it is not being sent overthe radio, the radios hardware encryption module cannot be used.Other downsides include auto acknowledgment supportwhen thisfeature is used, packets not addressed to the local node are discardedby hardware preventing services from overhearing messages usefulfor link estimation and routing.B. Integrated DesignInstead of using separate pluggable modules to create a full sensornode, Telos integrates programming, computation, communication,and sensing onto a single device. The integrated design provides aneasy to use mote with increased robustness.Telos uses an internal 2.4GHz Planar Inverted Folded AntennaPIFA built into the printed circuit board and tuned to match the radiocircuitry. An optional SMA coax connection may be used instead ofthe internal antenna. Integration of the antenna lowers the overall costof the mote since no expensive external antennae are needed.Telos is programmed either with the bootstrap loader or JTAGthrough onboard USB that also provides power. USB was chosensince it is a standardized protocol that interfaces well with currentPCs. Onboard USB is extremely easy to use and has lowereddevelopment time compared to nonstandard mote interfaces.Telos has a user button, reset button, and 16pin IDC expansionheader. The user and reset button signals are exported via the headerso the physical userinterface may be located on support hardware.The reset button may be retasked as a nonmaskable interruptallowing it to be used as a power button instead. By exporting I2Cand UART over the expansion header, IO bus expanders can be usedto attach as many connections as are found on legacy Micastylesensor boards 11.Inside the Telos, it is the first mote to include hardware writeprotection for external storage. When plugged into a USB port, thewrite protection is disabled and the first segment of the externalflash may be written. When running on batteries without USB, thesegment is write protected. Hardware write protection is essential forsystems that may be reprogrammed wirelesslysince a known goodprogram image may be stored in the write protected flash, there isalways a fallback mechanism to a usable mote.Each hardware subcircuit is isolated power to the circuit canbe turned on or off independently of the rest of the platform. This07803920190520.00 2005 IEEE 366Fig. 5. Packet yield left, link quality indicator LQI,center, and received signal strength RSSI,right outdoors with the Telos mote and internal antenna.The results are averaged over 10 receivers colocated. From 75110 feet, a dip in the terrain yields more erratic readings and wider variation in RSSI.isolation provides a degree of robustnessin the event of a failure,faulty modules can be disabled to minimize their impact on thesystem. The motivation for this design comes from the experiencewith realworld sensor networks on Great Duck Island GDI 12,6. On GDI, one of the main predictors of node failure was theexistence of a failed sensor. Since the failure can be recognized insoftware, the ability to cut power to that section of the board mayhave saved the system as a whole.Since the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol has a 64bit addressing scheme,we have included a 48bit silicon serial identification chip. Theid, combined with a manufacturers IEEE Organizationally UniqueIdentifier OUI stored in write protected flash, provides the userwith a valid, unique 64bit MAC address. The MAC address isuseful for system and network diagnostics, as well as absolute nodeidentification.C. AnalysisOur analysis of the Telos platform focuses on the platformspower consumption and the features that further research in sensornetworks. The power consumption of a sensor module is not just themicrocontroller andor radio, but also the auxiliary components andtheir quiescent current. The power consumption of the Telos motefor various operations compared to the existing Mica2 and MicaZplatforms is shown in Figure 6.Telos features a lower power flash and microcontroller than Mica2Atmel with CC1000 radio and MicaZ Atmel with CC2420 radio.Due to Telos integrated design, 3A additional current in sleepstate is sacrificed to switches and buffers that protect current fromflowing backward into disconnected components, specifically theUSB circuitry. Despite this sacrifice, the overall power consumptionof a sampling cycle wakeup, sample, transmit, and sleep is lowerthan existing platforms. The power consumption is the total time themote is active multiplied by the current consumption during that time.Since Telos has lower current consumption, lower startup time, andlower operating voltage for the entire mote, it can achieve longerlifetimes than previous designs. At a 1 duty cycle, Telos can lastfor almost 3 years. For comparison, the lifetime of the Mica2 moteis 1.5 years and the MicaZ mote is 1 year 1.Lower power consumption does not imply that Telos has less functionality. Powerful microprocessor modules are now being integratedinto embedded microcontrollers. Telos features a DMA controllerthat operates while the MCU core is sleeping. The DMA permitsapplications to sample from the ADC, output a voltage on the DAC,Operation Telos Mica2 MicaZMinimum Voltage 1.8V 2.7V 2.7VMote Standby RTC on 5.1 A 19.0 A 27.0 AMCU Idle DCO on 54.5 A 3.2 mA 3.2 mAMCU Active 1.8 mA 8.0 mA 8.0 mAMCU  Radio RX 21.8 mA 15.1 mA 23.3 mAMCU  Radio TX 0dBm 19.5 mA 25.4 mA 21.0 mAMCU  Flash Read 4.1 mA 9.4 mA 9.4 mAMCU  Flash Write 15.1 mA 21.6 mA 21.6 mAMCU Wakeup 6 s 180 s 180 sRadio Wakeup 580 s 1800 s 860 sFig. 6. Measured current consumption of Telos compared to Mica2 andMicaZ motesor transfer data to and from the radio without interrupting the MCU.DMA is traditionally used to increase performance, but in the case oflow power embedded systems, the DMA controller actually lowersthe duty cycle by permitting the MCU core to remain asleep longerand service less interrupts. The performance enhancements of DMApermit up to 200ksamplessec ADC sampling, compared to a maximum of 10ksamplessec on MCUs without DMA some powerfulMCUs can achieve as high as 70ksamplessec, but no interruptbasedmethod on current MCUs can achieve 200ksamplessec. The lowersampling rate is caused by the overhead of context switching due tointerrupts after each ADC conversation. Telos also has builtin brownout reset, supply voltage supervisor, and interrupt driven sensors tomaximize the sleeping time of the mote.For communications, IEEE 802.15.4 radios provide applicationswith information about the incoming signal. Telos onboard antennaprovides a mostly omnidirectional pattern1. We tested the effect ofdistance on received signal strength RSSI, packet success rate,and link quality LQI. LQI is a metric introduced in 802.15.4that measures the error in the incoming modulation of successfullyreceived packets packets that pass CRC check. We placed 10receivers at the same location and 1 node transmitting at 0dBm at adistance d, all located 4 above the ground outdoors. We averaged theresults over all receivers. Figure 5 shows the average packet success,LQI, and RSSI for Telos using the internal antenna. The LQI providedby the radio closely maps to the packet success rate as shown inFigure 5. The RSSI follows an exponential decrease while the packetsuccess rate is high after 60 feet, the signal is noisier and decreasesto the minimum sensitivity of the transceiver. The small variance in1More microbenchmarks including radio and antenna impedance matchingcan be found in the Telos datasheet 13.07803920190520.00 2005 IEEE 367RSSI among receivers and the correlation between LQI and packetsuccess rate provides additional information not previously availableto network services such as multihop networking and localization.The consequence of using a higher speed radio is that it maysaturate the MCUs processing capabilities when the channel isfully loaded. We ran experiments on a 30 node Telos network tomeasure the effective bandwidth. A single Telos node is able tosource approximately 12 of the full data bandwidth of the channel,or 125kbps. When all 30 nodes transmit as quickly as possible,Telos is limited to an average reception rate of 150kbps. Our currentimplementation is interrupt driven however we intend to increaseperformance by using the DMA controller to directly transfer datafrom the radio, reduce the number of interrupt context switches, andreduce the number of receive buffer overflow events.D. Enabling ResearchTo support current research efforts, Telos integrates a number offeatures that create more robust systems. Deluge 14 is an epidemiccodepropagation protocol used in BNP 15 to reprogram the network wirelessly. In the event that a faulty code image renders thenode unusable, a halted node may be reset via the watchdog timer ora button referred to as a Golden Gesture. Telos will automaticallyreload the microcontrollers code flash with the hardware protectedgolden image.The golden gesture can be performed through a number of sequences. Since Telos features a User Button for external user input,a combination of pressing the reset and user buttons may be requiredto boot to the golden image. The user button may serve other userprogrammable services thereby providing a method for physical inputto be received at the mote when radio commands are not an optionsuch as during physical deployment.Due to Telos low wake up times, the mote is automatically put tosleep when there is no active processing. By automatically enteringthe lowest power mode when idle, Telos has a lower operatingpower profile. The low power profile also makes Telos attractivefor rechargeable designs, including solar and vibration harvesting.Since Telos operates down to 1.8V, supercapacitor designs are nowpossible many supercapacitors operate at a maximum of 2.5V, lowerthan the minimum operating voltage of previous motes. Since thesleep current and wakeup times are lower, harvested energy may bestored quicker and be used for more operations.Finally, Telos lowers the barrier of entry for using WSNs. Byusing USB on every mote, any Telos may operate as an experimentaldevice on a lab bench, a gateway to a PC or higher functionalitydevice, or as a node in a large testbed. In the lab or classroom,USB provides an easy and robust way to interface, program, andexperiment with motes. As a gateway, no programming or interfaceboard is required and any node may act as the gateway. Finally, offtheshelf USB products are a low cost method for deploying testbedswith a backchannel link. Backchannels are important for developingalgorithms on the motes while being able to debug their state andoperation without relying on the wireless transceiver. Most testbedswith backchannel links are created using long runs of Ethernet. Theinfrastructure cost of a 60node Telos testbed is approximately 1,000600 in cabling, 400 in USB hubs. For longer cable runs, a LinksysEthernet to USB device may be purchased for 79 and includes 2USB ports. A networked testbed with Linksys devices is an additional2,400. In contrast, a 60node Mica2 testbed costs almost 21,000in infrastructure hardware alone 349 per Mica2 Ethernet adapter asof February 2005.E. Software ImplicationsThere is a huge impact on the software when creating a newhardware platform. TinyOS 16 is a componentized operating systemsuitable for research in wireless embedded systems. The compositionof components and whole program analysis allows researchers towork on the system at any level e.g., the details of link protocolsup to the application semantics. Since the MSP430 is a differentarchitecture than the microcontrollers commonly used in TinyOS, wewere forced to rethink hardware abstraction for embedded systems.An opportunity was created by Telos to redesign the existing TinyOS1.1.x interfaces to create effective abstractions that take advantage ofthe powerful hardware features of the MSP430 microcontroller.We developed a threetier architecture to provide a hardwareindependent abstraction regardless of microcontroller or radio. Thedesign is described in detail by Handziski et. al. 17. We choseto expose the primitives of the hardware, such as register accessand module flags, through a hardware presentation layer HPL.A platformdependent hardware abstraction layer HAL exposeshardware module functionality so that the full power of the hardwaremay be used. The HAL includes getting data from the ADC,setting a hardware Timer, or writing to external flash. The hardwareindependent layer HIL exposes a subset of a platforms capabilitiesthat are available to system services. The HPLHALHIL model isimplemented in TinyOS for the TI MSP430 microcontrollers and hasbeen adopted as the basic architecture for hardware abstraction bythe TinyOS 2.0 Working Group.On top of the HALHPLHIL abstraction, we built a platformindependent radio stack link protocol and physical layer access forthe CC2420 transceiver. Each platform using the CC2420 implementsa set of components that provide register access to the radio the radiostack then acts as a library that uses these primitives to the controlthe radio. Our CC2420 implementation operates on Telos, MicaZ,iMote2, and Chipcon CC2420EB platforms. Since these platformsall share the same physical layer, TinyOS enables crossplatformcommunication and research on hybrid networks.IV. CONCLUSIONWe have presented the design and implementation of Telos, thelatest generation in a family of motes from UC Berkeley. We showedthat Telos is the lowest power mote to date. Telos includes numerousenhancements that enable research in wireless sensor networks whilemaking the devices easier to use and lowering the permodule cost.Other features, like hardware write protection and radio signal stability, closely map to current research. Researchers may experiment withthe new IEEE 802.15.4 standard and use existing work in TinyOS.Additional flexibility allows software to configure or disable hardwaremodules. Telos is a robust module with lower power consumption yetgreater performance than existing designs.REFERENCES1 J. Polastre, R. Szewczyk, C. Sharp, and D.
