Ostro Project Home Features Documentation Downloads Get Involved Home Features Documentation Downloads Get Involved Documentation Toggle Dropdown Documentation Website Welcome to the Ostro™ Project - an open source reference Linux*-based operating system built using Yocto Project tools. Ostro OS is tailored for IoT smart devices so you won't need to force-fit a general Linux OS to suit your IoT device or write your own OS. The Ostro OS is simple for existing Linux users to adopt and it conveniently provides an application framework that supports multiple developer languages. It is out-of-the-box ready to install and has powerful features that easily support IoT device development.   Ostro Project provides simplified access to complicated IoT required constructs including pre-configured and validated sensor support, various level of security mechanisms, and communications and interconnectivity protocols such as  Open Connectivity Foundation  (OCF) via built-in  IoTivity  support. Ostro OS is both expandable and customizable. The base OS image can be used as-is or configured without recompiling for faster development .  Two reference images are available: the base  Ostro OS  (for headless devices) and  Ostro OS XT  (eXTended for devices with graphics and media support).   Ostro Project is designed for today’s needs. Join the project now to help write the future of the Internet of Things.  Downloads Watch video Twitter GitHub Features Optimized for Connected Devices Ostro™ OS is a Linux* distribution optimized for the development of connected and embedded devices. In fact, Ostro Project is designed specifically to support IoT device development. It integrates connectivity and networking, device-to-device interconnectivity standards, pre-configured sensors, and over-the-air update capabilities. Easy and Customizable The Ostro Project is all about making IoT device development easy and fast on multiple architectures. Developers have their choice of application languages as Ostro Project supports Native C/C++ and Node.js. Pre-built binary distributions are available that you can configure to get devices up and running immediately on supported platforms. Ostro Project includes powerful capabilities for developers to tailor the OS to their liking. Built with Security in Mind Security is not just a buzz word – security is paramount. Ostro Project developers utilize a strict security development life cycle with frequent code reviews to ensure possible threats are identified and addressed in all stages of development.   Documentation As the Ostro™ Project community grows, it's important to share design and implementation ideas with the whole community. Our technical documentation is written by and for developers, and documentation source is included with the source code release in GitHub. We will add more technical information about the Ostro OS as we continue its development. These links help you navigate through our online documentation: All Documentation These technical documents and architecture guides help you learn more about the Ostro OS and how to use it to create and deploy IoT applications. Articles These technical notes contain details about specific Ostro OS capabilities and how to use them. Getting Started This guide explains how to set up an Ostro OS development environment and how to install and run applications on supported platforms.   Downloads The Ostro™ Project provides pre-built OS images for the base and eXTended releases for all listed supported platforms as well as the source files needed to rebuild the images. Because the Ostro Project uses Yocto Project tools, you'll also have capability to configure and modify the OS to suit your project needs. Ostro OS source code is maintained on public GitHub repositories. Check out the README file there for more information about each repository and its organization.
