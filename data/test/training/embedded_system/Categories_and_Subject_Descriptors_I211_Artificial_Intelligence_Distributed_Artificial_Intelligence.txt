SENSOR NETWORKSIn recent years, the technology of microelectromechanical systems MEMS has made rapid advances. Various smart devices,such as sensors and actuators with some information processing capabilities embedded within, have been developed and deployed inmany realworld applications 4, 5. To meet the needs of vast demands of MEMS in various application domains, such as avionicsand plant automation, it becomes critical to connect a large numberof sensors and actuators, up to thousands, tens of thousands or evenmillions of units, and to integrate and embed sensing, signal anddata processing and control functions on individual devices.To make our discussion concrete, we now describe the problemof object detection using MEMS devices. Detecting and tracking mobile objects in large open environments is a topic that hasThis research was supported in part by NSF Grants IIS0196057and EIA0113618, and by DARPA under Cooperative AgreementsF306020020531 and F3361501C1897.Corresponding author.

We are developing such a detection and tracking system using MEMS sensors, each of which is operated underrestricted energy sources, i.e., batteries, and has a small amountof memory and restricted computational power. In a typical application of our system, a collection of small sensors are scatteredin an open area to detect possible foreign objects moving into theregion. Each sensor can scan and detect an object within a fixed radius. However, the overall detecting area of a sensor is divided intothree equal sectors, and the sensor can only operate in one sectorat a time. The sensors can communicate with one another throughradio communication. The radio channel is not reliable, in that asignal may get lost due to, for instance, a collision of signals frommultiple sensors, or distorted due to environment noises. Moreover,switching from one scanning sector to another sector and sendingand receiving signals take time and energy.The system needs to meet two conflicting goals. While attempting to detect all objects as quickly as possible, the system must alsopreserve as much energy as possible in order to prolong its lifetime.The problem is thus to find a distributed scan schedule to optimizean objective function that balances the above conflicting goals. Thekey to the problem is how individual units should be programmedto work as a coherent piece toward achieving common goals.2. DIFFICULTIES AND FEATURESMany unique features of MEMS devices and distributed applications make the development of sensor networks difficult. Usinga special sensor device, Berkeley Motes 2, and our application ofobject detection as examples, we discuss some of the difficulties ofproblem solving in sensor networks. Restricted resources. MEMS devices are typically developed with a low price in mind. As a result, the computationalresources, e.g., the CPU speed and memory, are limited. Forexample, a Berkeley Mote carries a slow 4 MHZ CPU, only512 Bytes of memory for instructions, and a small 4 MBytesmemory for data. The computational resources on a sensordetermines the amount of computation it can provide withina fixed period of time. Faulty devices. The application environments that sensornetworks are applied to may be severe, such as an environment of high temperature and high pressure as in the avionics domain. The reliability of MEMS sensors may be significantly reduced under such environments. Therefore, thelifetime of a single device is reduced, as is the reliability of asensor network as a whole. Unreliable communication. Wireless communication provides much flexibility and extends significantly the applicability of sensor networks. It is one of the most desirable features of sensor networks. However, wireless communicationalso introduces additional problems to the development ofsuch a system. Reliability of wireless communication is alsoone of the issues that has to be addressed. Restrictive time bounds. Sensor networks usually operate under severe time restriction, sometimes within unknownbounds on system response time. Adding information processing capability to sensors alleviates the time issue. Somesimple and lowlevel decision making problems can be solvedby coupling sensing and information processing on board.However, it still remains a challenge to fully utilize the onboard information processing functionality to increase the responsiveness of an integrated sensor network. Limited energy. Due to physical restrictions and the distributed nature of many applications, the sensors and actuators in distributed sensor networks usually operate on limitedenergy sources, i.e., batteries. It is an important, but difficult,problem to save energy to prolong the life span of a system.Even though there are many difficult issues involved when using MEMS sensors, they are used to build robust and largescalenetworks with many desirable features. Scalability. It is one of the design objectives to have a sensornetwork scalable to a large number of components, perhapsto tens of thousands or even a few million components. Scalability means that the system performance does not degradedisproportionally with the size of the system or even does notdegenerates at all when the number of components increases. Realtime performance. Many applications, such as our object detection and tracking, require continuous and spontaneous responses. There are also problems in which the deadline for a response is unknown but can become imminent atany time. Therefore, a good anytime performance is desirable for a sensor network. Here, anytime means that a systemcan be stopped at any time with a solution. Selfstabilization and fault tolerance. To tolerate faultycomponents and support adaptation, it is expected that a sensor network is able to tolerate components failure. It is alsoexpected that the system be able to stabilize itself in that itis able to eventually converge to legal states, under local perturbations to restricted parts of the system.3. APPROACHES AND INITIAL RESULTSMultiagent system MAS technologies can and will play criticalroles in developing effective and efficient problemsolving strategies and methods in largescale sensor networks. They provide aframework for building and analyzing such systems and offer specific mechanisms for distributed decision making and coordinationin the systems . In the past two decades or so, MAS research hasproduced techniques for distributed problem solving and reasoning 6.However, many computation and communicationintensive methods, such as negotiation, may not be suitable for distributed problem solving in sensor networks where computational and communication resources are limited. To accommodate the physical restrictions and provide some of the features needed by highperformance sensor networks, it is desirable to apply distributed problemsolving methods that require little computation and communication. Such methods must use information local to the computational nodes and their neighbors, rather than information related toglobal states of the overall system.In our current research, we are building a distributed sensor network for mobile object detection and tracking. We have been focusing on distributed problemsolving methods that use local information. We have considered distributed breakout algorithm 3,7 and distributed stochastic algorithm DSA 1 for solving a fewcombinatorial optimization problems in sensor networks 8, 9, 10.Specifically, we proved that DBA is complete on acyclic constraint networks in that it is able to find an optimal solution insteps on a network ofnodes. This implies that DBAcan be used for selfstabilization in acyclic networks, a desirableproperty for distributed problem solving. We also showed a simple ring structure on which DBA may fail to find a solution andproposed stochastic schemes to increase its completeness in cyclicnetworks 9. In addition, we investigated the phasetransition orthrashing behavior of DSA on sensor networks 8, 10. Our experimental evaluation revealed that DSA is usually more effective andefficient than DBA, in terms of solution quality and communicationcost.In summary, our current experience in developing distributedsensor networks leads to the conclusion that simple distributed algorithms that use limited, local information and communication,such as DSA and DBA, are capable and suitable for distributedanytime problem solving in distributed sensor networks.4.
