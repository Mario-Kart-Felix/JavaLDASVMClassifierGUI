This article first summarizes space exploration missions and existing platforms that todate have been developed by ad hoc, oneofakind cyberphysical integration efforts.   The primary goal of this paper is to present a series of cyberphysical systems CPS challenges that, if addressed in the emerging science of CPS, will greatly facilitate complex space systems development in the future.   Areas of focus include spacecraft communications, driven by relative orbiting network node positions as well as bandwidth and power considerations, attitude control and orbit determination, and space robotics and science payload systems.  A strong CPS challenge problem is introduced  scheduling the instructions executed on a small spacecraft processor such that the magnetic field introduced by this processor induces torques favorable for spacecraft pointing.  Keywords  space systems robotics communication attitude control I.  INTRODUCTION Cyberphysical systems CPS are engineered systems that are built from and depend upon the synergy of computational and physical components. 1  With CPS we will be able to observe, change and even customize certain aspects of the physical environment that traditionally were beyond reach. 2   Networked computer systems embedded in devices that interact with the physical world form the basis of CPS, but the CPS research community is aimed at building a new systems science that is jointly computational and physical. 3 The goal of this paper is to define space systems challenges the CPS community can help overcome given spacecraft that perpetually move through their environment in a manner that creates a highlydynamic evolution of cyber e.g., computational, networking and physical e.g., orbital position, spacecraft pointing properties.  Below, we present space systems challenges associated with communication, attitude and orbit determination and control, and payload management.  With respect to communication, delays and blackouts based on the relative positions of orbiting spacecraft and potentially sparse ground stations must be predicted and managed.  Stringent power budgets also limit data processing and bandwidth.  For planetary exploration such as the longterm Mars Exploration Rover MER missions Spirit and Opportunity, multihop delaytolerant networks 4 are required to efficiently route messages from an extraterrestrial planets surface to an orbiter, to an Earth orbiter, then to an Earthbased ground station.  With respect to processing, space systems lag Earthbased systems primarily due to the harsh radiation and temperature extremes of the space environment that can result in reduced component lifetimes and singleevent upsets SEUs that must be anticipated in software.   Autonomous spacecraft attitude and orbit determination and control require tight coupling of onboard sensors and software and effective incorporation of external data particularly for orbit determination OD.   With respect to payload management, we first describe CPS challenges associated with science instrument data collection, onboard processing, and communication, then we consider challenges in deploying space robotic systems that can be trusted to accomplish tasks such as inspecting and repairing other spacebased assets.   We conclude by describing a novel CPS challenge in which the electromagnetic emissions associated with computer processing are themselves used to intentionally perturb the attitude of a small CubeSat.  This challenge is at the core of CPS, redefining middleware in a manner that requires the spacecraft to correlate its schedule of computational tasks and attitude holdmaneuver directives at the most fundamental CPUcycle level. II. A BRIEF HISTORY OF SPACE EXPLORATION CPS Space systems have necessarily been cyberphysical for nearly half a century, with computers and physical craft together enabling us to observe and visit the extraterrestrial environment that would otherwise be beyond the reach of all the inhabitants of Earth.  Early cyber elements of space systems supported the computation and execution of launch and orbital maneuvers, including rendezvous and reentry.  Even early spacecraft computers were also used to perform numerous prelaunch selfchecks accurately and efficiently.   In 1964, a 99pound IBM computer guided the Saturn 6A launch vehicle into space 5.     In 1965, the 59pound Gemini guidance computer was first launched 6 this computer was embedded on all Gemini flights.  Early spacebased computers were custom designed and challenged by extremely low memory and processing bandwidth constraints given todays standards.  Programmers worked with lowlevel instruction sets and focused their attention on recording instrument data 2012 IEEEACM Third International Conference on CyberPhysical Systems978076954695712 26.00  2012 IEEEDOI 10.1109ICCPS.2012.1345and executing required maneuvers.  The Apollo guidance computers 7, along with an impressive suite of physical systems, were successful in carrying astronauts to the Moon and back to Earth, providing the astronauts with sensor data and orbital maneuver solutions that would have been difficult to impossible to have manually computed and executed.  The Apollo engineers followed emerging software engineering practices but faced challenges throughout the development cycle, particularly given the extreme need for computers to be lightweight for their time to support carrying them and powering them throughout the Apollo missions  8.   The US Space Shuttle software development and management program 9 was a highlysuccessful longterm endeavor that helped the software engineering community mature understanding and practices of the software life cycle process.   In early space CPS, human engineers were responsible for jointly considering the properties of the computational system and the harsh physical environment in which it was required to reliably operate, imposing formidable radiation and thermal load constraints.  The overhead associated with this manual software engineering process is of course not sustainable as the CPS grows in capability and complexity. While early computer systems assisted astronauts in manned spaceflight, the cyber elements in unmanned spacecraft are at the very core of their missions.  Unmanned spacecraft are launched but not returned to Earth intact  they therefore must collect and communicate all information related to their mission while on orbit.  Without a reliable suite of cyber and physical components, unmanned spacecraft would merely be weights we have typically paid 10,000USD per pound to launch.  Earthorbiting satellite constellations for communication and navigation e.g., the Global Positioning System GPS have had a profound impact on our everyday lives.  These spacecraft and the ground elements interacting with them are CPS in that onboard and groundbased software handling satellite data takes into account each satellites orbital position to determine and capitalize on communication windows and speedoflight communication delays.  Software on the satellites themselves may be relatively simple, and often is custom to that particular satellite or constellations application.   With respect to extraterrestrial exploration, NASA has launched a series of missions that demonstrated that unmanned spacecraft could indeed explore well beyond Earth orbit and return valuable science data.  Fixed and programmable sequencers carried on early spacecraft such as the Mariner series 10 executed a set of carefullytimed instructions without the use of onboard sensor feedback, enabling capabilities such as image acquisition and transmission to Earth.  Programmable sequencers allowed mission controllers to interrupt activities and jumps to new subroutines, but code was not highly customizable.  The Viking probes to Mars launched in 1975 11 consisted of Orbiter and Lander modules, each of which carried dual redundant computers.  As an early example of feedback control, the Viking Orbiter used realtime accelerometer data to calculate when to fire its thrusters it also contained early watchdog software to help it handle longterm lost link situations.   From Voyager and Galileo to the recentlylaunched Mars Science Laboratory 12, embedded sensing and computing capabilities have grown to support semiautonomous to autonomous operations.   The Mars Exploration Rovers MER Spirit and Opportunity 13 outlived their expected mission lifetimes by years, representing an incredible opportunity for scientists but at a nontrivial cost to NASA given the overhead of Earthbased operations required to support these missions until they end.   Given the harsh and unknown environmental conditions, space missions such as those cited above have demonstrated a remarkable ability to survive and accomplish ambitious goals despite no local human presence as well as formidable bandwidth and delay issues.  However, these missions are typically very costly to develop, often implemented as oneofakind systems due to the uniqueness of each mission.   The space systems community is beginning to work toward models of hardware and software reuse and is striving to develop smaller, more agile and costeffective space systems that are derived from modelbased reasoning abstractions throughout the product development cycle.   This brief history of space exploration systems illustrates the significant accomplishments of the Aerospace community.  This history also highlights several significant challenges that must be overcome to substantially reduce the cost of developing spacecraft and managing them once launched, in particular through better abstractions and development processes that may be realized through application of the emerging science of CPS. III. SPACEBASED COMMUNICATION The goal of the communication system is to transfer data in a timely manner where specifics are defined by mission requirements.  Data transfers may occur between spacecraft and Earthbased stations, between multiple spacecraft, or between planetary surface platforms e.g., rovers and Earth.  Planetary surface and deepspace communications typically rely on the Deep Space Network DSN to relay data tofrom Earthbased networks.   For any communications system, the maximum theoretical transfer rate is described by the ShannonHartley theorem 14 and is a function of the signal to noise ratio SNR and the transmit bandwidth.  The signal to noise ratio of a communication system is estimated with a link equation, shown in Equation 1 for a low fidelity example.                                               1 Pt is the transmit power and Gt is the gain of the transmit antenna.  Signals losses, Ls and La, are free space loss due to transmission distance and atmospheric attenuation, respectively.  Gr is the gain of the receive antenna.   k is Boltzmanns constant and together with Ts, the noise temperature, estimate the noise level of the system.  R is the data rate. The link equation requires analysis of the cyber and physical components of a communication system and their complex relationship.  The cyber and physical elements are summarized in Table 1.  46  Table 1  Cyber and physical elements of a spacebased communication system. Cyber elements Data The primary payloads and sensors of the mission generate data.  Also, the satellite generates health and status data as well. Storage Systems Data storage provides a buffer for when communication links are intermittent.  Traditionally, storage has been small limited to several megabytes but as flash systems are flight qualified, gigatera byte systems are available.   Computation Resources Flight control computers and processors in the radio systems provide computation capability for packetization, compression, and analysis of the data. Network Topology The network continually evolves in most space missions due to orbital trajectories.   It often evolves predictably with highly accurate estimates that good for several days. Hardware Hardware includes antennas, amplifiers, radios and modems.   OSI Layer Stack On top of the hardware are various protocols and layers.  Generally these layers are isolated to promote interoperation on heterogeneous networks.  However, knowledge of layer performance between layers can be used to optimize links. Physical elements Communication node dynamics Space mission nodes move, and usually in welldefined orbits.  Communication outages are expected and must be planned for at all levels. Noise and attenuation environment The noise environment in space can be quite dynamic since the communication nodes are exposed to large areas.   Attenuation varies depending on weather and can render communication links inoperable. Free space loss Distance between communication nodes can vary from meters to millions of kilometers.  Communication systems require flexibility to support this. Access to energy collection Solar energy can be harvested only when the spacecraft is exposed to the sun rather than in the shadow of the planet it orbits e.g., Earth.   Energy utilization is a function of communication bandwidth. Attitude dynamics Not only do the spacecraft move, they also rotate.  This affects antenna pointing and link availability.  The network topology of space systems perpetually evolves as a function of orbit dynamics and the communication system architecture.  Low Earth orbit LEO missions, such as many weather satellites, orbit the Earth once in approximately 90 minutes.  Typically, they are capable of communication with a particular ground station four to six times a day.  Medium Earth orbit MEO missions, such as the Navstar satellites in the GPS constellation, orbit the Earth in several hours.  Geosynchronous Earth orbit GEO missions, such as digital TV broadcast satellites, orbit the Earth once per day.  If such satellites are geostationary i.e., they follow an equatorial orbit path, they effectively hover over a single region of the Earth.   Many missions communicate directly to ground stations that provide communication interfaces to operations centers.  The missions collect data, store it onboard, and downlink when ground stations are visible and available.   Other missions relay their communication contacts through other orbiting satellites.   For example, the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System TDRSS is deployed by NASA to provide global communication relay.  It supports the International Space Station ISS, Space Shuttle in the past, other scientific missions, and also rocket launches.    Thus, any spacebased communication system must be aware of the physical positions and motions of the network nodes to predict and adapt to the dynamicallyevolving network topology. Constrained resources particularly on a spacecraft limit communication capability.  Antenna gains tend to be low due to constraints on mass, volume, and power.  Their beam patterns are fixed and require satellite attitude changes for steering.   Transmit output power is limited by available onboard power sources.  Generally, transmit systems draw instantaneous high currents from the battery system which must be replenished at a slower rate by solar power.  These limitations result in lower signaltonoise ratios thereby limiting data rates. An additional challenge is the occurrence of failures or loss of efficiency in onboard components and subsystems.  Failures are either transient and recoverable, or permanent and not fixable since most space missions are not serviced after launch. For example, due to improper ground handling, the Galileo mission failed to deploy its high gain antenna enroute to Jupiter and lost the expected 134 kbps link.  Multiple upgrades on the satellite and on the ground were made to improve throughput over its low gain antenna system for an effective throughput of 1  kbps 15.  Transient faults are expected due to the radiation environment.  Bit flips occur randomly in near Earth orbits due to trapped particles in the Earths magnetosphere.  Deep space missions are exposed to solar storm events that can render most electronics inoperable. The computational capabilities of the space segment are limited by the harsh radiation environment and by onboard power resources.  Processors for flag ship missions are generally radiation hardened to reduce single events effects and enable long term exposure to total ionizing dosage.  These processors are multiple generations behind the latest terrestrial technology.  Modern processors, particularly those used in mobile computing platforms, are integrated into lowercost space missions.   They provide high speed and power efficiency at the cost of radiation susceptibility.  Often, they are operated with a lowduty cycle to reduce the impact of radiationinduced failures.   Thus, computationally intensive tasks such as compression, forward error correction, and other algorithms are generally limited on orbit. 47  CPSbased research can address the challenges of space communication systems.  Here are a list of questions and related comments that highlight possibilities. Can communication systems become energy aware  More power translates directly to increased signaltonoise ratio SNR.  All space systems are launched with excess power generation capacity.  Tapping into this excess would enable increased SNR.    Sensing of realtime power generation and usage on a space mission would enable the communication to assess onboard resources and use appropriately to manage SNR. Can communication systems become position aware  Spacecraft and ground station position knowledge is required for scheduling communication contacts.  Typically, scheduling is handled by human operators, but a positionaware communication system would offer several advantages.   First, variations in transmit power and data rate could dynamically adjust the link budget to optimize downlink for calculated positions and free space signal loss.  Second, knowledge of future contact times could be used to plan energy budgets for communication with optimal ground station systems. Can communications systems become attitude aware  Spacecraft orientation governs antenna pointing direction and therefore the antenna gain value of the link budget.  A communication system aware of attitude and able to control it would be able to optimize antenna gain directed towards the other communication node.  With a phased array antenna system, the antenna beam could be electrically steered and reduce the impact on satellite attitude control. All this culminates in a communication system that is aware of where it is, how it is pointed, and what computational resources it has available so that it can adapt to optimize the communication link.  It can adapt to be more efficient or maximize throughput.  This requires a blend of both physical and cyber capabilities. IV. ATTITUDE AND ORBIT DETERMINATION AND CONTROL The attitude and orbit determination and control subsystems on a small spacecraft provide an obvious connection between onboard processing and sensing elements with the spacecrafts physical environment. Sensors, including sun sensors, star trackers, rate gyros, magnetometers, and temperature sensors, provide a direct or estimated state of the spacecraft relative to its surroundings.  With these instruments, the spacecraft can propagate its six degreeoffreedom position and attitude state without reliance on data from external sources, but for missions whose orbits and pointing must be precise, the use of external data sources is beneficial.  For example, orbit determination OD is generally improved through the use of Earthbased ground stations that can triangulate a spacecrafts location in a similar manner to how GPS signals are used to triangulate positions on Earth.  Fusion of onboard and external state data links the cyber aspects of communication for triangulation with the physical environment and its local sensing.  For Earthorbiting systems, onboard and offboard OD aids spacecraft in monitoring drift orbits and correcting them when necessary, and in computing and assessing orbit transfer maneuvers, again making early corrections in cases where the transfer maneuver was not precisely executed.  While onboard and external attitude and OD sensors are primarily directed toward determining the rigid body state of the spacecraft over time, as with many components on a constrained spacecraft, they can also be exploited to provide additional, often unexpected, information.  Onboard the Radio Aurora Explorer RAX spacecraft developed at the University of Michigan, 7 sun sensors, with a 70 degree field of view apertures, provided an indication of the vector from the spacecraft to the sun. These sensors also served to verify antenna deployment. When sensor inputs were evaluated against a model of the spacecraft, comparisons were made of the time of expected shadow crossing of a sun sensor against the timehistory of the sensor measurements. Thus verification of antenna deployment was completed when the model of sensordropouts matched the recorded sensor values. On a small and constrained spacecraft, it is often the use of components outside of their intended function that allows for unobservable states to become observable. As small spacecraft become more capable, knowledge about the external environment will likely become more critical. For instance, CubeSats are now being proposed with arcsecond pointing accuracies required which requires at least arcsecond rotational determination. 8 But these systems will likely also grow beyond one spacecraft, making each spacecraft a single node of a larger entity  coordination and sensor fusion across multiple nodes with limited communications bandwidth will be a nearterm challenge. Consider the current challenge of the initial orbit determination of a CubeSat upon launch. These small spacecraft are generally deployed en masse from the launch vehicle. Nearterm payloads are expected of 50 or greater satellites, but in this example, we will consider only two satellites. The North American Space Command provides radar tracking giving a rough estimate of where the spacecraft are in the sky, but no indication is given of which spacecraft is which. Often it is amateur radio operators from around the world who attempt to track and communicate with these satellites. A single operator has a difficult challenge in independently tracking and communicating with a recently deployed CubeSat with only a single attempt every few hours. Instead, global operators exchange information about recent attempts, including tracks attempted, frequencies used, and expected accuracies, via the Internet. This information, from a disorganized and ad hoc group, significantly reduces the time it takes to uniquely identify each satellite. As larger systems of spacecraft are considered, this method of information exchange likely wont be enough to uniquely determine the entire system within a short period of time. Here, coordination and communication between the individual satellites will be necessary, with an exchange of state such as sun vector location that might assist in determining the order of the spacecraft along a single orbit track. Thus each node becomes a sensor entity of a virtual swarm, where the exchange of information from the nodes helps to determine the overall system state. The swarm can also assist individual 48  nodes in determining their state in the case of a system failure, possibly due to a radiation induced singleeventupset. The exchange of timely information might provide an initial condition for a startup state for the damaged craft, significantly reducing attitude and position estimation time for the injured vehicle. This organizational memory using the attitude and position sensors of other nodes in the swarm may help to combat spacecraft failures. Knowledge of global swarm location with respect to individual nodes is also important for future rendezvous and docking maneuvers. CubeSats have extremely limited propulsion systems very few are currently available on the market, so each maneuver counts. Coordination between the nodes becomes critically important to achieve a docking with minimal fuel usage. Thus the challenges for attitude and orbital positioning systems may be outlined as Exploitable Sensors  Using sensors to measure states outside of their intended use. Sensor Fusion  Using multiple, often distributed, sensors to obtain a clear estimate of a state. Networked Nodes  Using sensors across spacecraft to determine state relationships between craft. Swarm Nodes  Using multiple spacecraft to determine hidden state relationships between craft that may not be fully observable. Addressing these challenges will enable more precise pointing and greater capabilities for nanospacecraft as the systems grow more complex. V. PAYLOAD MANAGEMENT Payloads are the primary purpose for space missions.  Space missions exist to place payloads at particular points of interest for commercial, science or military purposes.  For example, the primary payload of the Hubble Space Telescope HST is a 2.4m telescope.   HST generates TBD and communicates through the geosynchronous Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System TDRSS.    The Mars Exploration Rovers MER have a variety of imaging and insitu sensors to study the surface of mars.  They communicate directly to Earth through the Deep Space Network DSN and also through communication satellites in orbit around Mars.   The Solar Dynamics Observatory SDO is in geosynchronous orbit and monitors the sun with multispectral imaging systems.  It transmits data continuously at over 150 Mbps generating over 1.5 terabytes per day of data.   Payloads typically fall into three categories that describe how they collect data continuous, scheduled, and opportunistic.   Continuous missions collect data all the time.  Scheduled missions collect data at set times often over specific regions.  Opportunistic missions collect data when interesting events are detected.    The payload drive the design of the space system along with the expected orbit dynamics.  The satellite bus provides the support systems to operate the payload.  The bus provides power, pointing, communication, data processing, and thermal control.   Typically, the payload is capable of consuming far more resources such as power, computation, and communication than is allotted due to mission constraints such as cost.  Therefore, payload operation is scaled back and limited to fit within budgets.   Below are questions that the CPS community can answer to improve payload operations. Can a payload become of aware of sensors and events beyond the confines of the host satellite  Space is immense and satellites generally have a limited field of view in this context.  Being able to interconnect distributed sensing platforms and events detected by them would provide additional insight into operations.  Payloads would have a better sense on environmental related to their mission and enhance their sensing as needed or appropriate.  This real time data fusion would create greater opportunities for mission collaboration.   Can a payload harvest spare computing cycles, communication opportunities, and power to enhance operation  As noted earlier, payloads are capable of consuming far more resources than practically allotted to them.  Providing access to underutilized resources would allow them to perform more sensing.  Identification and scheduling of these resources is not effectively performed on current missions. VI. SPACE ROBOTICS All spacecraft can be viewed as robotic given definitions such as a device that performs complex often repetitive tasks and a mechanism guided by automatic controls 18.  However, the Aerospace community has distinguished space robots from traditional spacecraft and fixedbase landers in that a space robot is presumed to possess the ability to manipulate andor move within a complex and potentially unknown environment.   This section first provides background on classes of space robot systems   and example missions for each followed by a discussion of associated CPS challenges.   The communication and processing challenges discussed above all apply to space robot systems and are accentuated when robots need teleoperation 19 or supervisory inputs from remote mission operators despite time delays, or when autonomous robots are faced with challenging task sets and contingencies to manage despite impoverished onboard computational resources. In orbit, freeflying space robots can provide observations of other platforms such as the space station at viewpoints otherwise difficult or impossible to achieve.   Experimental validation of freeflying space robot systems is challenging on Earth 20 and is most commonly achieved through neutral buoyancy, shortduration parabolic flight e.g., on the KC135 aircraft, or through use of counterbalance drive systems that allow a platform to navigate as if it is freely moving in three dimensions despite gravity.  On Earth, precursor systems to freeflying space robots include NASAs Personal Satellite Assistant PSA 21 and the University of Marylands Supplemental CAMera Platform SCAMP neutral buoyancy vehicle 22, demonstrating autonomous navigation capabilities.  Two freeflying robotic systems have been deployed in space  AERCam Sprint 23 which was strictly 49teleoperated by the space shuttle flight crew, and SPHERES 24. Planetary surface rovers map and traverse sites of interest.  Payloads such as hyperspectral imagers provide valuable data even when the robots observe but do not manipulate their physical environment.  Perhaps the most successful extraterrestrial rovers todate are the Mars Exploration Rovers MER 25.  Their precursor, Mars Pathfinder 26 was also successful, but with up to a twenty minute communication delay to Mars, teleoperation was stressful for the operator who had to base new commands on old imager and other onboard sensor data.  MER conducted short traverses autonomously then waited for further instruction before continuing.    A variety of robotic missions benefit by direct manipulation of the environment.  Docking is a specialized form of manipulation that has been used longterm to allow one space system to slave its motion to another, often for the purposes of transferring payload andor power.   Both the Space Shuttle and International Space Station carried remote manipulator systems Canadarm and Canadarm2 27 teleoperated by onboard astronauts to minimize delay.   Multimanipulator systems such as the Ranger telerobotic vehicle tested in neutral buoyancy simulation 28 can provide capabilities such as onorbit assembly 29 as well as satellite servicing 30, ultimately enabling upgrades and repairs that extend the lifetime of existing equipment rather than launching new spacecraft while the old craft become space junk.   Manipulator systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated in fact one humanoid robot, Robonaut 2 31, is present on the ISS, serving as a semiautonomous assistant to the astronaut flight crew.  On planetary surfaces, manipulation can be used to deploy sensors, obtain samples, and carry manipulate payloads e.g., cameras on a mast with a precision not easy to achieve strictly with a mobile base.  Such challenges are shared by Earthbased robots that autonomously navigate and interact with their environment.   Modern spacesuits can also be considered instances of robotic cyberphysical systems due to their embedded network of sensors and processors used to monitor the astronauts vital functions, communicate with the astronaut and mission control, and manage life support. 32  Traditional spacesuits substantially restrict astronaut motion and limited visibility, mostly designed to provide redundant life support functions including maintaining a reasonable temperature through active cooling and circulating a breathable atmosphere at a lifesustaining pressure inside the suit.  While the astronaut provides the primary actuation for mobility and manipulation, the spacesuit is filled with sensors to monitor and communicate vital statistics that convey a sense of the astronauts current and expected health.   Audio and visual communications devices enable astronauts to maintain situational awareness beyond looking out the restrictive spacesuit visor other peripheral devices e.g., wristmounted touch screens have been proposed to help the suited astronaut better interact with the environment and other robotic or human agents in it. Space robot systems possess most or all of the cyber and physical component enumerated above.   They therefore face the CPS challenges listed previously, which focus on incorporating awareness of energy, position, and attitude into optimization of communications and onboard mission management.  However, the robots must also compute and execute maneuvers, manipulate and react to their environments in realtime, and manage anomalies without a definitive shutdown, particularly for proximal space systems for which space robots face additional challenges.  Below are questions we encourage the CPS community to address in future research. Can space robots jointly optimize processing, communication, mobility, and manipulative actions subject to the unusually restrictive delay, blackout, bandwidth, processing, and energyfuel constraints present in space systems  This question is also relevant to Earthbased robotic systems, but the constraints and ramifications for a space robotic system are often more stringent.  As a relatively simple example, consider a mobility task for a satellite servicing robot  rendezvous with a target spacecraft.  To achieve this goal, an optimal orbit transfer must be computed ideally onboard and executed in a manner that saves fuel, using data from groundbased assets as well as onboard instruments to ensure accurate OD before and after the maneuvers, and making iterative orbit corrections as needed.  Specifics of the approach and docking trajectory would then rely on physical and cyber parameters, including maintaining communications with the target satellite if active and mission control supervisors.  Todate rendezvous and docking specifics have been largely scripted with safe mode as the primary contingent response, but such implementations are quite brittle compared to what would be possible with true CPS optimization.   Can space robots safely and collectively reconfigure their cyber and physical resources to detect and manage internal anomalies as well as anomalous or adverse environmental situations  Space robots typically will operate near other robotic systems andor astronauts.  It is essential that failuresfaults in cyber and physical resources be managed, and that even unanticipated environmental events are managed.  A CPS must be capable of jointly considering the performance tradeoffs required to maintain safety by jointly reconfiguring processing, communication, mobility, and manipulation tasks.   Can spacecraft, space robots, and human supervisors astronauts and mission controllers safely and efficiently cooperate in a shared physical environment where both information flow and physical interactions must be coordinated  We have studied a simplified version of this humanrobot interaction challenge in a laboratory setting where a robot manipulator and human have the potential to interfere with the others flow of information e.g., through visual occlusion  andor to physically block the others motion to a goal worksite. 32  While visual occlusion and manipulator blockage are physical workspace constraints, effective collection, processing, and communication of information among agents with simultaneous consideration of their physical worksite is a CPS challenge. 50VII. COUPLING COMPUTATION WITH POINTING  A FUTURE CPS CHALLENGE FOR SPACE An intriguing problem for small space systems couples attitude determination and control with onboard processing. Most CubeSats have an extremely low inertia  so low that onboard magnetictorque coils can orient the spacecraft in lowEarth orbit with application of low currents through the wire coils. As expected, larger current loads on these coils increases the strength of the magnetictorquer, turning the spacecraft faster. A recent challenge for these small spacecraft becomes one of sensors  attitude is often measured with the use of magnetometers in conjunction with sun sensors. Thus the same magnetic field that is needed to turn the spacecraft creates a disturbance force in the measurement.  To provide context, in a typical lowEarth orbit, the external magnetic field magnitude is on the order of 0.5 Gauss, and a contemporary CubeSat processor can generate a field magnitude on the order of 0.001 Gauss. The external magnetic field drops quickly as altitude raises, to a magnitude of 0.001 Gauss at 20,000 km, a typical mediumEarth orbit altitude.  For the higher Earth orbit, processorgenerated magnetic field is comparable to that generated by the Earth.     A more challenging aspect of this problem occurs as spacecraft become more selfsufficient with powerful onboard processing. Processors are great users of power, often requiring several watts of power at low voltages. This requires the draw of possibly several amps from the batteries and along the power bus of the spacecraft  often built in a loop to facilitate other subsystems, safety cutoffs, and required devices. Now the computational power required to calculate the attitude of the spacecraft can actually force an attitude change through the creation of a magnetic field. In fact, complex code can create larger torques than simple code.   Figure 1 Schematic of the magnetic determination system with disturbances induced by the actuator and the processor.  In this case, the computational complexity becomes more than a problem for the software designer  the spacecraft operator must account for it also. Because small spacecraft often exploit systems for unintended uses, there can be reasons for complex code as well. For a computationally demanding mission with large attitude change requirements, payload processing could be scheduled to occur when a large attitude change is needed, and light processing scheduled for times of needed attitude stability. The code scheduling now becomes a control for spacecraft attitude actuation, in conjunction with the intended magnetictorque actuator.  The challenge is creating a realtime operating system to truly connect the cyber and the physical. VIII. CONCLUSIONS Since space vehicles and systems often work autonomously, or at least maintain some functionality in an autonomous manner, they serve as a prime example of cyberphysical systems. Sensors record information about the physical environment, computers deduce steps to proceed, and actuators create a change in the environment. But the inherent limitations of spacecraft, be it in communications, attitude determination and control, or other system, create challenges that many terrestrial systems do not have to face. Those challenges, as outlined in the previous sections, provide a wealth of research opportunities. Of particular interest to the cyberphysical community is the unique set of problems where software has direct interaction with the environment, such as within the case study presented for a magneticallyactuated spacecraft. Here, computationally complex code can directly interfere with, or control, the spacecraft. These kinds of challenges can often occur in the unusually challenging environment of space  another example is that the spin of a hard drive could serve as a reaction wheel, storing rotational energy to stabilize the spacecraft  and should be accounted for as systems become more compact.  It is an interesting time to study cyberphysical systems as the two worlds merge, and the systems become more prevalent. Understanding and exploiting CPS may yield new systems where software is even more intrinsically linked to hardware and system functionality.
