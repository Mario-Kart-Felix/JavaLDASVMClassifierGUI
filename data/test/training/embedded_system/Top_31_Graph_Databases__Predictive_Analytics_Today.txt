These database uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. Every element contains a direct pointer to its adjacent elements and no index lookups are necessary in a graph database.

This is an embedded, disk-based, fully transactional Java persistence engine that stores data structured in graphs rather than in tables.Neo4j speeds write throughput significantly across the board, as much as 100 times in certain cases to benefit highly concurrent applications while leveraging available hardware much more efficiently. This is achieved through faster buffering of updates, and a new unified transaction log that now serves both the graph and its indexes.Neo4j is an open-source graph database, implemented in Java.Neo4j delivers the lightning-fast read and write performance you need, while still protecting your data integrity. It is the only enterprise-strength graph database that combines native graph storage, scalable architecture optimized for speed, and ACID compliance to ensure predictability of relationship-based queries. Dataiku FREE Dataiku DSS is the collaborative data science platform that enables teams to explore, prototype, build, and deliver their own data products more efficiently. Dataiku DSS provides an interactive visual interface where they can point, click, and build or use languages like SQL to data wrangle, model, easily re-run workflows, visualize results, and get up-to-date insights on demand. Dataiku DSS provides tools to draft data preparation and modelisation in seconds, that wish to leverage their favorite ML libraries (scikitlearn, R, MLlib, H2O, and so on), and that rely on automating their work in a completely customizable interface. Data Ops. Dataiku Neo4j Neo4j 2.AllegroGraph AllegroGraph is a modern, high-performance, persistent graph database. AllegroGraph uses efficient memory utilization in combination with disk-based storage, enabling it to scale to billions of quads while maintaining superior performance. AllegroGraph supports SPARQL, RDFS++, and Prolog reasoning from numerous client applications. AllegroGraph is designed to store RDF triples, a standard format for Linked Data. A custom browser, Gruff, is available for viewing the graph. AllegroGraph AllegroGraph 3.Oracle Spatial and Graph Oracle Spatial and Graph supports a full range of geospatial data and analytics for land management and GIS, mobile location services, sales territory management, transportation, LiDAR analysis and location-enabled Business Intelligence. The graph features include RDF graphs for applications ranging from semantic data integration to social network analysis to linked open data and network graphs used in transportation, utilities, energy and telcos and drive-time analysis for sales and marketing applications.
