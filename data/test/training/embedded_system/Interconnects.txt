Chen  Technology in 21 century has developed in an accelerated rate. As a technology indicator of modern era, computer has developed from its early age to ubiquitous equipment in every day life. The driven force for faster computer has become even stronger. Together with the fastevolved highspeed Internet, faster computes are processing huge amount of data. Electrical interconnect between CPU and memory has become the bottleneck of data processing in computer. The foreseeable solution to address this bottleneck is to use optical interconnect replacing vi electrical interconnect. However, before this substation becomes reality, many difficulties to integrate optics into VLSI system have to be addressed.  In this dissertation, a fully embedded optical interconnect system is proposed. The main attribute of optical interconnect system with fully embedded form is the high degree of reliability. Together with the high bandwidth, low power consumption, the optical interconnect system is fully compatible with VLSI circuit and fully fulfill the request of bandwidth between CPU and memory. The fully embedded optical interconnect system includes three main components thin film VCSEL vertical cavity surface emitting laser as optical transmitter, thin film GaAs MSM metalsemiconductormetal photodetector as optical receiver and flexible polymer waveguide as optical transmitting media. Thin film MSM photodetector array is fabricated and integrated with channel waveguide array. The whole system integration among thin film array of photodetector and VCSEL and thin film flexible waveguide is presented.     vii Contents  Chapter 1 Introduction of Optical Data Links..1 1.1 Overview of telecommunication.....1 1.2 Timeline overview of computer..3 1.2.1 Timeline of early age computer...3 1.2.2 Time line of modern computer........6 1.3 Historic evolution of internet and WWW worldwideweb. ...10 1.4 Challenges faced by board level electrical interconnect.13 Chapter 2 Theoretical analysis of photodetector..20 2.1 Electrons in periodic structure.20 2.2.1 Bandstructure of semiconductor..22 2.2.2 Conduction and valence band in semiconductors....23 2.2.3 Density of States..26 2.2.4 Band structures of Silicon and GaAs...27 2.2.5 Electron transport property in semiconductor..32 2.2.6    Optical absorption of semiconductors..34          2.3 Semiconductor photodetectors.35 2.4 PIN photodiode37 2.5 APD avalanche photoddetector.39 2.6 MetalSemiconductorMetal photedetector.40 Chapter 3 Silicon and GaAs MSM photodetector47 3.1 Introduction......47 3.2.1 Thin film silicon based MSM photodetector...48 viii 3.2.2 Fabrication of 112 thin film silicon MSM photodetector array..52 3.2.3 Testing of 112 thin film silicon MSM photodetector array.....59 3.3.1 GaAs MSM phodetector....68 3.3.2 Testing of GaAs MSM photodetector array......78 Chapter 4 Epitaxial liftoff GaAs MSM photodetector array and integration with waveguide83 4.1 Introduction..................83 4.2 Thin film MSM phodetector array by epitaxial liftoff technique....85 4.3 Design and fabrication of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector..89 4.4 Characterization of thin film GaAs photodetector..95 Chapter 5 Integration of board level optical interconnection system.101 5.1 Introduction101 5.2 Integration of GaAs MSM photodetector array and polymer waveguide array with 450 TIR micro couplers.104 5.3 Measurement of integrated GaAs MSM photodetector array and polymer channel waveguide array.109 5.4 Integration of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector, channel waveguide with micromirror coupler and thin film VCSEL..112 5.5 Summary117 References..120 Vita.132    ix  List of Figures  Fig. 1.1 Diagram of free space optical interconnect15 Fig. 1.2 Diagram of fully embedded optical interconnect...17 Fig. 2.1 Electron energy levels in single atom and band structure in semiconductor..22 Fig. 2.2 band structure of direct and indirect band gap semiconductor...24 Fig 2.3 Band structure of silicon..28 Fig 2.4 Band structure of GaAs...29 Fig 2.5 Fermi distribution curve..31 Fig 2.7 Schematic of PIN photdiode ...39 Fig 2.8 Schematic of basic APD structure ..40 Fig 2.9 Intedigitated contacts pattern of MSM photodetector.41 Fig. 2.10 Optical absorption coefficient of different semiconductor...43 Fig. 3.1 Cross section structure of Si MSM photodetectro..49  Fig. 3.2 Absorption coefficient of silicon50  Fig. 3.3  Band structure of Silicon...50  Fig3.4, The energyband diagram of MSM junction...52  Fig. 3.5 Etched contact finger pattern of MSM thin film photodetector55  Fig. 3.6.

As recorded in human history, people in ancient Egypt used fire to transfer military messages. Even though humans had realized that messages can be transferred through open space, there were many limitations of this communication method. The most severe disadvantage was that the signal was not visible over a very long distance so that there had to be many relay stations to sustain the signals.   The starting point of real implementation of long haul communication began on Friday, 13 July 1866 when the largest ship at that time with 2730 nautical miles of copper cable in her hold, left Valentia, Ireland and bound the destination Trinity Bay, Newfoundland. The mission of the ship was to lay down a line of copper cable through Atlantic Ocean. The copper cable was laid down through Atlantic Ocean and telegraph message started to be sent between the two continents through this copper cable. This event opened up one hundred years of telecommunication using copper cable.  1 The idea of using optical light to transmit message was conceived even before the telecommunication using copper cable took place. Around 1790, a French engineer, Claude Chappe originated optical telegraph. The method was to build a series of towers 1015 km apart, equipped with telescope. The wooden beam on the tower could stand out different positions that were assigned to numeric symbols in connection with a codebook. While a message took days to transmit with this set up, individual symbol may reach transmission speed up to 500 km per hour. This was a novelty tryout without much impact on telecommunication because of the complexity, high cost, slow transmission speed and lack of security.  Late eighteen century witnessed the rapid development of telecommunication using copper cable. However, the scene of telecommunication was totally changed by the invention of laser around 1960.13 Research of telecommunication using laser as the source of signal was renewed, but the main focus was on transmitting laser through open space46. This direction of research did not capitalized because of its fundamental shortcomings. Even though laser light kept its focusing power very well through long distance the heavy absorption of atmosphere to laser beam causes so high loss of its intensity that it could not travel long distance.  The real breakthrough emerged, almost one hundreds years after the first transAtlantic cable was laid down on the bottom of Ocean. Optical fiber, the real player of transmitting media in telecommunication industry came to light around 1970s when three Corning scientists, Dr. Donald Keck, Dr. Bob Maurer and Dr. Peter Schultz invented low loss optical fiber79. The revolution of replacing copper 2 cable with optical fiber took place after Corning announced their lowloss fibers, which showed loss below 20dBkm at the 633nm heliumneon wavelength. The development of optical interconnect technology using fiber optics in the 1970s was a milestone of the modern telecommunication industry. Replacing copper cables with optical fiber provided superior performance in term of the wide data bandwidth, low loss, and reduced noise level. It also significantly reduced the cost of communication system. Even in the early stage of developed optical fibers, they were able to transmit 65,000 times more information as copper wire10.   1.2 Timeline overview of computer 1.2.1 Timeline of early age computer The first computing device as we know today is abacus that appeared circa 1200 AD in China. The abacus was mans first attempt to automat the counting process. Strictly speaking, the abacus is more a device to remember the current state of computing than a device to really compute numbers. For over a thousand years after the invention of abacus, automatic computing remained in same way. The automatic computing machine came to light when a British mathematician and inventor, Charles Babbage, designed and built it around 1820s. The machine was called difference engine and it could perform simple mathematical calculations. The difference engine consisted entirely of mechanical components and numbers were represented in the decimal system. The device Babbage built was far from real 3 computing machine by modern standard, but it did demonstrate that machine could automatically perform mathematical calculations.  The calculating principle of modern computer was invented by another British mathematician Alan Turing. Turing conceived the computing machine with limitless memory and digital inputs and outputs1112. The machine read a series of zeroes and ones through a magnetic tape. These zeroes and ones were the instructions and data on which the machine need to process. Even though this is a well accepted idea today, this was a revolutionary concept at that time since all other design of calculate machine only performed a particular task on a limited range of purposes. Turings idea was brilliant for the time. To modern standard, however, the machine he built was very slow in speed. With the ongoing World War II, British were in a critical moment to defend their air space in order to stop German amphibious invasion. It would put British Military in a great advantage if the enemys encoding message could be deciphered. It was at that time when Dr. Turing designed British Colossus13, a completely electronic computer capable of deciphering encoded messages of German military. It used paper tape reader to input data and 2400 vacuum tubes to make up the electrical calculating system. The Colossus deciphered German military code quickly and efficiently. It was considered as the first step towards modern computer.  Different steps were taken in US to build military computer.  J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly of the University of Pennsylvania built Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer ENIAC 1416. It took three years for J. Presper 4 Eckert and John William Mauchly to build the machine.  Physically ENIAC was gigantic, it contained more than 18,000 vacuums, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and it weighted 30 tons. It used 160kW electricity when it fully operated. Because the bulkiness and huge power consumption, it was one time design and it would never be redesigned nor upgraded.  The real computing machine for normal people was yet to come with other technology breakthrough. The technology breakthrough did come in 1947 when three Bell Lab scientists, John Bardeen, Walter Brittan and William Shockley invented first transistor17,18. The invention led them to share Nobel Prize in physics in 1956. The invention of transistor sparkled people to produce computer by transistors. Even though transistors are remarkably smaller than vacuum tubes and they consume far less power, computers made by transistors were still very bulky, inefficient and slow. The tide to make computer by using transistors did not last long because of all the disadvantages of transistor. In early days, electronic circuit were composed of many individual components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, vacuum tubes etc.. With the invention of the transistors, vacuum tubes were obsolete and replaced by transistors. As a result, electronic circuits could be made more complex, much faster because transistors are much smaller and switch much more rapidly. But the construction techniques of those circuits reached their limit quickly. It was still very hard to assemble too many transistors on the circuit board. These transistors could not be arranged closed enough to keep signal, among those transistors, to travel at decent delay time.  5 Another brilliant invention came to the light around 1958 when scientist Jack Kilby1920 of Texas Instrument conceived a way to fabricate many electronic components on a piece of semiconductor and as a result, integrated circuit was developed. Not only could many transistors be made at once on a piece of semiconductor, but also other electrical components such as resistors, inductors, capacitors could be made by the same process as well. By fabricating all the electronic components on a piece of semiconductor, IC integrated circuit was invented. IC leads to the building of the microchip, which is the heart of todays computer. As a matter of fact, ENIAC, the first electronic computer made from vacuum tube that weighted 30 tons and consume 150 kW power, could be redesigned and be made by IC and it could be as small as a hand held calculator. Only after the maturation of IC could make todays computer a reality, and the bulky, expensive and huge power consuming computer made from vacuum tubes quickly became history. With the invention of IC, much of the computers computing abilities, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and logic operation could be located on a single small chip.                1.2.2 Time line of modern computer In 1971 Intel released the worlds first commercial microprocessor21,22, the 4004. This processor could only process 60,000 instructions per second. It used 2300 transistors and had 108 kHz clocking speed. A year later Intel introduced microprocessor 8008, which was twice as powerful as microprocessor 4004. It used 6 3500 transistors and had 200 kHz clocking speed. The continue line of processor from Intel constituted 8080 processor in the late 70s which was developed into 8086 and 8088 in 1979. The processor 80868088 was a central processing unit of computer it acquired data and instruction form and wrote result back to Random Accessed Memory RAM upon its finishing computing. The maximum clocking of 8086 and 8088 were 8 MHz and 10 MHz respectively and the transistor usage was 29,000. The maximum physical memory of 8086 and 8088 was one megabyte.    In 1982 Intel introduced processor 80286, which was an enhanced version of processor 8086 its main enhancement lied on the ability to access 16 megabytes of memory. With the increased ability to access memory, processor 80286 was the first to run all of the software written for its predecessor. Its clocking speed was between 6MHz to 12.5 MHz and the transistor usage was 134,000.  In 1985, Intel introduced 386processor, which was the first to use 32bit addressing and it could utilize up to 4 Gigabytes of memory. This was the first time when concern of interconnects came to the light because of CPUs capability to address the large quantity of memory. Its clocking speed ran through 16 MHz to 40 MHz and transistor usage was 275,000. There were foreseeable instances that there existed discrepancy between the processing speed of CPU and the slow fetching rate of data and instructions from main memory. There was no imminent call for the increasing of bus speed because CPU processing speed was still under 100 MHz and it took several CPU clocking cycles to fetch a single instruction or datum from main 7 memory. At the time of Intel 386 was used, the CPU, memory and bus were all clocking at the same speed.       In 1989 Intel introduced processor 486 which could run even higher clocking speed than its predecessor. The transistor usage was 1.2 million and clocking speed of 486 ran through 25 MHz to 33 MHz and later up to 100 MHz. It was at that time when the different running speed between processor and memory emerged. A computers memory is the repository for all the information used by and produced from the computers CPU. At processing speed of 100 MHz, the processor met the problem of waiting data and instructions coming out of the memory.  From time on, cache memory started to appear on same die with CPU. Cache memory typically exploits the principle of spatial locality of references by prefetching a fixed amount of data and instructions that are contiguous to the referenced data and instructions. The caches are generally made up of static random access memory SRAM and faster than random access memory RAM although more power is used and more chip area is occupied. The widening gap of speed between the processor and memory has lead to employment of cache memory. In the next design of processor 486, Intel included eight kilobyte Level 1 cache memory on CPU chip. On that chip, there was some flexibility on data handling CPU could use some data and instructions on the L1 cache to compensate the waiting period of the data and instructions being fetched from main memory.  In 1993, Intel debuted its first Pentium processor that used 3.1 million transistors and had the clocking speed either 60 or 66 MHz. Not only did the usage of 8 transistors and the clocking speed was increased, but the L1 cache memory was increased from 8 kilobytes to 16 kilobytes as well. The processor Pentium Pro was unveiled in 1995 and the transistor usage and the clocking speed were increased to 5.5 million and 200 MHz, respectively. Besides the 16 kilobytes L1 cache memory that located close to main processing unit of CPU, a 256 kilobytes or 512 kilobytes L2 cache memory was also included in Pentium Pro processor as well.  After the clocking speed exceeds 100 MHz, there is a growing discrepancy between the operation speed and the speed of feeding data and instructions from main memory. There were several main reasons to include cache memory. The general rule of super fast computing relies not only on how fast the CPU runs, but also sufficient data and instructions have to be fetched out from memory at high speed. Since the reality of slow bus speed of the motherboard, the cache memory was introduced.   Cache memory permits CPU fetching data and instructions in a batch instead of fetching them one by one. This certainly speeded up CPUs processing speed dramatically as long as the program to be run by CPU was in a good series order. If the program was in an odd series order and CPU could not predict well of adjacent data and instructions then there would be a high probability that following data and instruction would not be fetched on time in the cache memory. In this case a delay penalty would occur CPU would wait the right data and instruction be fetched out from main memory, as the result a miss penalty would occur and the processing speed would dramatically reduced.  9 There are many algorithms to address this issue and different tradeoffs had to be made. However, miss penalty always exists as long as the data and instruction sets are not fetched from main memory directly. In order to fully utilize the 512 kilobytes L2 cache memory, Pentium Pro CPU used three instructiondecodeunits to work in parallel to decode object code into smaller operations called microops. The break down instructions went into an instruction pool and could be executed out of order by execution units. Suppose there were optical interconnects exist at that time to substitute electrical interconnect, and ran at speed faster than CPU, the whole history of computer architecture would be rewritten and there would be a big waste to include any cache memory on the same die with CPU.   In 1999 Intel unveiled Pentium III processor. It employed 9.5 million transistors and the clocking speed ran between 650 MHz to 1.2 GHz. The cache memory sizes were either 256 kilobytes or 512 kilobytes. The minimum line width of transistor had shrunk from 0.25 to 0.18 micron meters. It was the new minimum line width of transistor to make this high processing speed possible. Even though the bus speed had also increased from precious 66 MHz to 100 MHz, the speed mismatch between CPU and memory still existed. Higher bus speed and large onchip cache memory helps the situation of this speed mismatch, it sacrificed the performance dramatically if miss hit in the cache memory happened CPU would suffered long waiting time for data and instruction sets to be fetched from main memory.                           1.3 Historic evolution of internet and WorldWideWeb WWW 10  The fast evolution of computers processing speed was partially intrigued by the fast development of internet, also called worldwideweb. Usually high technology instruments and apparatus were driven by either military requests or simply by government funding to explore unknown boundaries of mankind. In the early years of computer development around the time of World War II, it was the imminent request to break German military code to motivate British Scientist Alan Turing to construct Colossus, the first electronic computer to efficiently break German code in time. However, the computer industry would have little chance to boom without big consumer market. At early stage of the computer development, the highest processing speed at that time was needed. However this need only came from scientific research field and cost of that high speed processing could somehow overlooked, if noticed at all. The sole motivation from scientific field could not sustain the continuous development of the processing speeds of chips if the broad consumer market was not created. That consumer market was finally generated with emerge of array of software that could be run on computers. The need of faster computer processing speed was intensified by the advent of internet and later the fast communication speed of the internet. Information now could be transferred up to 155 Mega bytes per second and the data transfer speed up to 1020 Giga bytes per second is being under test23. Instead of word processing ability of the computer in the early days, now computers send and receive large amount of information from internet and 11 accordingly process those information. It is already a reality that computers handle from low speed word processing to high speed graphic processing.         The worldwideweb was originated from the era of Cold War. The hypothesis was that if the nuclear war happened, would military units and different government agencies communicate A centralized communication system would be easily destroyed a whole new way of communication had to be developed. In 1972, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency DARPA funded a project to develop a way for computers to communicate with each other. It was hoped that safe communication among computers from military and different government agencies would be in a secure command and control over information during the wartime. The project first brought online computers from four US universities. The universities were University of California at Los Angeles, University of California at Santa Barbara, University of Utah and Stanford University. The initial prospective of the project assured that the internet was designed to be functional even in case some nodes were destroyed. If the most direct route was impassable, then information could still be directed through alternate routes. Soon after the establishment of internet, first email was sent in 1972. A year later, File Transfer Protocol FTP, enabling file transfer between different internet sites, was established. It would allow anyone who had the privilege to access the site to get file either download from or upload to the serve site. In 1986, a crosscountry 56 Kbps backbone of internet was accomplished from support of National Science Foundation. As the protocol of internet became standard, it reached everyone who had the access of the online computer.  12 There are two driven forces for higher processing speed of computer, one from consumer market and the other from military.  From consumer market, the rapid proliferation of affordable computers and fast connection to the worldwideweb enable computers to process huge amount information at short period of time. This force requires that even higher processing speed to be pursued. And the disparity of speed between BUS and CPU become even more prominent. Another driven force for higher computing speed comes from military. Military needs highest computing speed for the application from simulated nuclear explosion to guided missile recognition system. Many times the highest processing speed is sought after with emphasis on reliability and little attention is paid on cost.   1.4 Challenges faced by board level electrical interconnect  The development of optical interconnect technology using fiber optics in the 1970s was a milestone of the modern telecommunication industry. Replacing copper cables with optical fiber provides superior performance in term of the wide data bandwidth, reduced noise, and low loss. It also significantly reduces the cost of communication system. But the early success of optics in telecommunication industry did not inspire the electronic designer to adopt optical components into the computer system design. In particular, progress in inserting optical components and interconnects into digital system has been hindered by the relative high cost of the discrete optical components, by the lack of a flexible transmission medium that can be planar processed for the board level application, and by the lack of a packaging platform that can be used for both optical and electronic devices24. For practical purposes, the costperformance benefit does not justify the use of optical technology 13 within a computer system at a clock frequency much lower below 1GHz. The situation has drastically changed in recent years because 1 The rapid advancement of the microelectronics technology has significantly increased the chip speed, interconnected complexity, IO pins, and processing power, with clock speed now reaching 3GHz commercially and still increasing. 2 The use of parallel processors as the prevailing supercomputing architecture has significantly increased the number of the processors in highperformance computing. 3 The exponential growth of network computing and global communication networks such as the Internet has created significant traffic that demands computer to process much larger quantity of information. The increased complexity required for highspeed, highdensity crossplatform interconnects has made electrical wiring interconnect system more costly. In todays applications, data transfer rates exceeding gigabits per second are common in distributed computing systems, interactive multimedia, highspeed ATM switching, and network communication. A cost effective, wideband interconnect solution for highspeed data communication between chips, modules, boards, and backplanes is critically needed in all these systems. Recently, significant advances in optical materials, devices, and packaging technologies have made optical interconnects the viable wideband interconnects technology of choice. These enable technologies are Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser VCSEL array25, polymer based optical waveguide26 and highspeed photodetector array27. All of these optoelectronics can be handled, processed, and 14 packaged much like IC devices using planar fabrication and batch processing. These characteristics of optical materials are key requirements for lowcost, largevolume manufacturing.  There are two ways to optically connect different destinations, the free space28,29 optical interconnect and the guided wave optical interconnect.30,31  When using the free space optical interconnect approach, the optical signal is generated from a emitter VCSEL, focused by lenses and transmitted through open space before it reaches the receiver photodetector. This architecture is illustrated in Fig.1. The advantage of the free space optical interconnect is low loss in optical energy. The disadvantage of this method is the issue of reliability. Because free space optical interconnect rely on lenses to focus laser beam both form VCSEL and to the photodetector, this approach places a heavy burden on packaging to ensure  reliability issue. Also using optical lenses results bulkiness in the system. For these disadvantages, the free space optical interconnect system should not be implemented if the reliability of connection is emphasized.      15 source detectorlens lens Fig. 1.1 Diagram of free space optical interconnect   Another optical interconnect approach is the guided wave optical interconnect. In this method, optical receiver and emitter are connected by polymer waveguide. Compared with the free space optical interconnect approach, this technique provides structure stability and easiness of implementation. The best way to realize the guided wave optical interconnect is to embedded the whole layer of optical interconnect between PCB printed circuit board. The diagram of the fully embedded optical interconnect is presented in figure 2. In order to implement the fully embedded optical interconnect the characteristics of three main components have to be investigated. The three components of fully embedded optical interconnect are thin film detector as the receiver, thin film VCSEL as the emitter and thin film polymer waveguide and microcoupler mirror as the transmitting media.     16  Fig. 1.2 Diagram of fully embedded optical interconnect  There are five chapters in this dissertation. In the following chapter, the theoretical analysis of the photodetector is presented. First, the basic concepts of electrons and holes in a semiconductor are discussed, followed by the introduction of densityofstates and band structures of silicon and GaAs. Then the electron and hole transport properties in semiconductors are analyzed, followed by a discussion of optical absorption in semiconductors. The light absorption in a semiconductor and photodetection rely on the excitation of electrons from the valence band into the  Waveguide Thinfilm VCSEL Polymer Waveguide Interlayer Dielectric Electrical Interconnects VCSEL Polymer Waveguide Index Buffer Layers To receiving IC Electrical interconnect Layers Photodetector17 conduction band. The operating mechanism of semiconductor photodetectors is then introduced, followed by the description of different types of semiconductor photodetectors. The photodetectors discussed are PIN photodiodes, Avalanche PhotoDetectors APD, and MetalSemiconductorMetal MSM photedetectors.  In Chapter 3, MSM photodetectors are discussed. The main focuses are on the thin film silicon based MSM photodetector array and GaAs based MSM photodetector array. The detailed fabrication processes and characterization of these two types of MSM phtodetectors are followed.  In Chapter 4, the thin film GaAs based MSM photodetector is first introduced. Then the epitaxial lift off technique is presented. The epitaxial lift off technique is used to acquire thr thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array. This technique enables the heterointegration of the thin film GaAs photodetector array with the thin film VCSEL array and the polymer waveguide array.  Upon the successful fabrication of the thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array, its DC and temporal responses are then measured.  In chapter 5, the integrated system is first proposed.  Then the crosstalk of 112 polymer waveguide array was first measured before the integration. It is followed by the integration of the GaAs MSM photodetector array and the 112 polymer waveguide array with 450 TIR micromirror coupler. The properties of the integrated system are then investigated. Finally the whole system integration is presented. The integrated system is composed of the thin film GaAs MSM 18 photodetctor array, the thin film VCSEL array and the 112 polymer waveguide array with total internal reflection TIR micromirror coupler.                                                19 Chapter 2 Theoretical analysis of photdetectors  2.1 Electrons in periodic structure  Every semiconductor device involves electrons and holes in a bulk semiconductor material. According to the different band structure, semiconductors are divided into the direct band semiconductor and the indirect band semiconductor. The mostly used direct band semiconductor and indirect band semiconductor are GaAs and Silicon, respectively. In order to investigate different electrical and photonic process in semiconductors, the transport property of electrons and holes has to be investigated. To examine electrons inside a solid material we need to use quantum mechanics, i.e., the Schrdinger equation.  2202rErrVm h 2.1 r electronic state or wavefunction. E electronic allowed energy or eigenvalue. Vr background potential that is periodic in crystals.  The above equation is impossible to solve if an accurate solution is requested. Because there are nearly 1023 atoms in a 1 cm3 volume, if there is only one free electron in one atom then there are 1023 electrons. Those electrons interact with each 20 other. Normally the above equation is not solvable because there are many interactions between nuclei and electrons.   Fortunately many solid materials, include semiconductors, are periodic in structure and in potential. So there are two assumptions have to be made before equation 2.1 is to be solved. First assumption is that Vr, the potential seen by electrons has periodicity as the lattice  Vr  VrR  2.2 where R is the lattice constant. Second assumption is that even though every electron belongs to a specific nucleus, the electron finds itself in the field of all nuclei and all other electrons.32 Based on these two assumptions, the probability of finding electron is to be the same in all unit cells of the solid because every cell is identical. The Bloch theorem gives the form of the electron wavefunction in a periodic structure and states that the eigenfunction of electron wave is the product of a plane wave   eikr times a function which has the same periodicity as the periodic potential. Thus  kr  V kreikr  2.3  is the form of electronic function. The wavefunction has the property  krR  V krR eikrR  V kreik r eikR  kr eikR         2.4 21 Atomic levels ofIsolated atomsE1s2s,2p3s, 3p, 3d4s4pAllowed bands of crystal Fig. 2.1 Electron energy levels in single atom and band structure in semiconductor  2.2.1 Bandstructure of semiconductor The Bloch theorem states that the electron wavefunction in a crystal has a particularly simple form it is the product of a plane wave and periodic part of a cell.  As shown in Fig. 2.1 there are different energy levels in discrete atoms, as atoms are brought closer and closer to each other to form crystal the electron on a given atom starts to see the neighboring nuclei and other electrons, the discrete atomic levels start to broaden to form bands of allowed energies to be separated by gap. The allowed energy levels are called the conduction band and the valence band the gap between energy bands is called the forbidden band.  In the bound state, the electron energy is negative with respect to the vacuum lever. 22  2.2.2 Conduction and valence band in semiconductors The solution of Schrdinger equation in a crystal gives E vs k relationship that has regions of allowed bands separated by forbidden bandgaps. If the temperature is 0 K, the valence band of a semiconductor is totally filled and the conduction band is totally empty. When a band is empty, it cannot conduct current when a band is totally filled, it cannot conduct current either. When solving Schrdinger equation, the top of valence bands of most semiconductors occurs at effect momentum k0, the bottom of the conduction bands in some semiconductors occurs at k0. These semiconductors are called direct band gap semiconductor, such as GaAs, InP, InGaAs. In other semiconductors, the bottom of the conduction band shift from k0 to some degree, these semiconductors are called indirect band gap semiconductor, such as Si, Ge, AlAs. The bandstructure of direct band gap and indirect band gap semiconductor is shown in Fig. 2.2. The relationship between the energy and wavevector k is  zyxi iiic mkkEkE,,022 h  2.5 if the band structure is isotropic as in the case of direct band gap semiconductor materials, then the relationship simplifies as  mkEkE c 222h   2.6 23 Fig. 2.2 band structure of direct and indirect band gap semiconductor  Near the band edges, the electrons in semiconductor behave as if they have a mass m which is called as effective mass. For direct band gap semiconductors, the relationship is  ycvEmpmm 2020211  2.7 where eVEmpycv 202202  and m0 is the free electron mass. 24  Semiconductors are defined as materials in which the valence band is full of electrons and the conduction band is totally empty at 0 K. As the temperature arises, some of the electrons in valence band leave valence band and enter into conduction band. When all the valence band states are occupied, the sum over all wavevector state is zero. 2.8 this formula simply shows that there are as many as positive k states occupied as negative k states. When an electron at wavevector ke is missing, it is called a hole in valence band and the wavevector of the system ke is attributed to it. The relationship between wavevector of hole and electron is   ekkii kkkei 0eh kk    2.9 Even it is called a hole in valence band it is the representation of a missing electron in valence band. If the electron is not missing and valence band is full then electrons cannot carry any current in valence band. However, if an electron is exited into the conduction band, not only the electron in conduction band can carry current, but the missing state, the hole in valence band can carry current also if the electric field is applied. The hole in valence band acts as if it has a positive charge.   BvEedtdkhh h   2.10 where  and  are the momentum and velocity of the hole. hk hv 25  2.2.3 Density of States The electronic states in a semiconductor have a plane wave form modulated by the central cell part. Near the band edge, the relationship of momentum and energy is in the simple parabolic form  mkE222h  2.11 where  is the effective mass. m Density of state is the number of available electronic states per unit volum per unit energy around an energy E. If the energy of discussion is near the band edge and parabolic relationship between momentum and energy is assumed then the density of state is expressed as  3221232hEmEN dos   2.12 In semiconductor heterostructures the electron can be confined in a twodimension stricture, quantum well, the density of state is expressed as  2 h dosmEN   2.13 If a onedimension structure is produced in a quantum wire, the density of states is expressed as  26 h21212EmEN dos   2.14  for direct bandgap semiconductors, the density of state mass for the conduction band is the same as the effective mass    mmdos   2.15 for indirect bandgap material in which the effective mass is different in various directions, density of state mass is  31321  mmmmdos   2.16 where m1,m2,m3 are the effective mass in the three principle directions.    2.2.4 Band structures of Silicon and GaAs Silicon is the most important semiconductor material used in chip fabrication.  The semiconductor industry claims world wide sell 140 billion back in 1996 and silicon consist of more than half of the big market.34 Up to date silicon is still the unchallenged material in semiconductor industry. Silicon is an indirect band material, means that the minimum of band gap dose not occur at k0. The k position at minimum of the conduction band and k position at maximum of the valence band does not coincide, as shown in Fig. 2.3.    27  Fig 2.3 Band structure of silicon  The band gap of silicon is  6361037.417.124eVTTEg   2.17 The other properties of silicon are as follow density of state mass  1.08 m0, heavy hole mass  0.49 m0 and light hole mass is 0.16m0. Intrinsic carrier concentration at 300K is 1.5x1010cm3. As an indirect band material, silicon has poor optical properties because light cannot be absorbed efficiently to generate electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band. However silicon is still the backbone material in chip industry as the results of long time highly reliable processing technology developed by semiconductor industry.  GaAs is the main material in optoelectronic industry. Its usage extends from light emitting diode LED to different semiconductor lasers.  28  Fig 2.4 Band structure of GaAs  The band gap of GaAs is direct and shown in Fig. 2.4. This is the main reason that GaAs is widely used in optoelectronic industry. Also the fast electronic transport property makes GaAs the material of fast transistor manufacture. The band gap of GaAs is eVTTEg 204104.5519.124  2.18 The other properties of GaAs are as follow Electron mass is m0.067m0 in the conduction band. In the valence band, light hole mass is 0.08m0 and heavy hole mass is 0.45m0. Intrinsic carrier concentration at 300K is 1.84x106cm3. Because the band 29 edge E vs k relation is quite isotropic, the relationship of energy and wavevector k can be expressed as  mkE222h  2.19  where 0.067mm 0.  Previous the semiconductor material was treated at 0K temperature where the valence band is totally filled and the conduction band is totally empty. At this circumstance current cannot flow through semiconductor even an electrical field is applied. Thus at low temperatures the pure semiconductor exhibits very high resistance to current transport. Electrons obey Pauli exclusion principle which states that one state at the same time can only accommodate a single electron. At finite temperatures, the occupation of electrons and holes is governed by Fermi distribution formula as in Fig. 2.5 TkEEEfBFexp11   2.20 30  Fig 2.5 Fermi distribution curve  As temperature is raised, the shape of Fermi distribution function changes and some electrons are exited from the valence band to the conduction band. Now there are electrons in the conduction band and holes in the valence band and current can be carried through semiconductor. Besides the excitation from temperature, electrons can be exited from valence band to conduction band by optical energy. This is the basic ideal behind every photo detective sensors. The concentration of electrons in the conduction band is  dEEfENncEe    2.21 31 where NeE is the electron density of states near the conduction bandedge and is the Fermi function. For a three dimension system and the expression of NEfeE and , the concentration of electrons in conduction band is expressed as EfEcBFceTkEEdEEEmnexp1221 21232h   2.22 The hole distribution function fh is  exp1TkEEffBFeh   2.23 the approximation of hole distribution is based on the TkEE BF  .   2.2.5 Electron transport property in semiconductor The electron wavefunction is in the form expexp, , tirikutk kn    2.24 where kEh . If an electron occupies a certain energy level and has a momentum k at time t0, it remains at the same state throughout its lifetime provide its environment is the perfect crystal. When the external electrical field is applied, the electron obeys free Newtons law that is expressed as  extFdtdkh   2.25 32  If the abovementioned scenario is totally true, then the electrons can be accelerated indefinitely. In reality though, there are numerous defects in even perfect crystal, electrons will be scattered before reaching the edge of Brillion zone. Furthermore, there are vibrations of the lattice atoms and electron sees the vibration of lattice as scattering facter too. If a group of electrons move initially with the same momentum, because of the scattering either from the imperfection of lattice or the vibrations of lattice the momentum and energy of electrons will gradually lose coherence with the initial states. The time it takes to lose initial coherence is called relaxation time.   When an electron is under an electrical field, the electron tends to move in the opposite direction of the field and gain velocity from the field. The velocity an electron gained through electrical field is called drift velocity. The average drift velocity is the velocity gained by electron form the electrical field during the time when the electron is moving without scattering.   meEv scd  2.26 where v  is the drift velocity, d sc is the scattering time. The current density is expressed as EEmnenevJ scd  2 2.27 33 where  is the conductivity.  2.2.6          Optical absorption of semiconductors  Basically light is represented by electromagnetic waves and expressed as Maxwells equation.  2expexp0ztcniEE r    2.28 where z is the propagation direction  is the frequency is the refractive index and  is the absorption coefficient of the medium. For nonzero , there is absorption in the medium and the outcome of the light flux is  rnexp0 zIzI    2.29 Though absorption can happen due to a variety of causes, such as absorption of impurities and intraband absorption, the main focus is the bandtoband absorption. In a bandtoband absorption, a photon scatters an electron in the valence band and causes it going into the conduction band. In the absorption process, the conservation of energy is maintained.  h if EE   2.30 where Ef and Ei are the final and initial energy and h  is the photon energy. Because the minimum energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band is the bandgap, the photon energy must greater than the bnadgap for the absorption to occur. Beside the conservation of energy, the conservation of momentum is also 34 maintained. Since the k value of normal photon is essentially zero compared to the k value of the electron, the conservation of momentum guarantees that the initial and final electron state has the same k value. In other words, only vertical k transition is allowed. Because of the constraint of momentum conservation, the optical absorption is strong for direct bnadgap material, like GaAs. The optical absorption is weak for indirect bnadgap material, like Si. The reason of the weak optical absorption is that the lattice vibration is also required in the process of electron exitation in order to satisfy the law of momentum conservation.   2.3 Semiconductor photodetectors In an optical interconnect system, the photodetector acts as the receiver at the end of system. It converts optical signals into the electrical form. The semiconductor photodetector takes irreplaceable role in optical interconnection system. The basic operation process of a semiconductor photodetector is the generation of electronhole pairs from external optical excitation and the collection of the electrons and holes to generate electrical signals. Usually the laser beam illuminates on semiconductor surface and electronhole pairs are generated because the excitation of electrons from the valance band to the conduction band. In order to excite the electron from the valence band into the conduction band, the photon energy must be equal to or greater than the bandgap energy of semiconductor. Also the photon absorption is strongest when photons can directly excite electrons from the valence band into the conduction band. Since the photon momentum is extremly small compare with the electron 35 momentum, the conservation of momentum requires that electronhole transition is vertical in k space. Such transitions are only possible near the bandedge for direct bandgap material. The absorption coefficient can be written as  32212320202 22hhhhh grcvrEmpcmne   2.31  her mmm111      2.32 where nr is the refractive index h  is the photon energy Eg is the bandgap and is the momentum matrix element which allows the transition to take place. For GaAs material the absorption coefficient is calculated as cvp1214 106.5  cmEghhh  2.33 There is a cut off wavelength above which the absorption coefficient is zero. The cut off wavelength is expressed as 24.1 meVEgc       2.34  For detection of an optical signal, the light should be absorbed in certain distance. For a strong absorption of light, the condition 1 hL must be satisfied. When the light beam impinges upon a semiconductor and generates electronhole pairs, the detector performance depends on how the electrons and holes are collected. 36 If no electrical field is applied, then electrons and holes will be recombined and no detection signal is generated. However, when an electrical field is applied to the semiconductor, the electronhole pairs are separated and electrons flow to the anode and holes flow to the cathode. The resulting current flow is proportional to the incident optical power. A characteristic property of photodetector is responsivity and it is defined as the generated current divided by impinging optical power. opLph PJR    2.35 where JL is the photocurrent density and Pop is the impinging optical intensity. Another property of photodetector is quantum efficiency and is defined as how many carriers are collected for each photon impinging on the photodetector. eRphQ h   2.36 There are three types of semiconductor photodetectors PIN diode, metalsemiconductormetal MSM photodetector and avalanche photoddetector APD.    2.4 PIN photodiode PIN photodiodes are widely used in optical interconnect system.3436 The essence of the PIN diode is to generate electronhole pairs in depleted semiconductor region and collect carriers to outside circuit. When light impinges upon a semiconductor to create electronhole pairs, some of the carriers are collected at the 37 contact and lead to the photocurrent. The basic structure of a PIN is shown in Fig. 2.7 it is consist of a depleted region in the middle of the device, p and n region on either side. The PIN is under reverse biasing and the dark current of the device is independent from applied biasing voltage. The electrical field in this region sweeps the electron hole pairs rapidly. The electrons are swept into n region and holes are swept into p region. The photon current caused by the photons absorbed in the depletion region is expressed as   hopnpLPLLWeAI     2.37 where is the optical intensity of impinging light A is the diode area W is the width of the depletion length and LopPp, Ln are the diffusion length of holes and electrons respectively. Because electrons and holes are generated in depletion area and under high electrical field, they move very fast thus give a very fast response time of the diode. Beside the carriers generated in depletion area, some holes and electrons are also generated in p and n region. If they are under the diffusion length of the depletion region, the slow moving holes and fast moving electrons are able to enter depletion region and contribute to photocurrent as well. 38  Fig 2.7 Schematic of PIN photdiode   2.5 avalanche photoddetector APD APD attracts many interests in recent years.37,38  The new interests change the coupling mechanism of APD from top illumination to side illumination for boasting sensibility without sacrifice resposivity.39 The basic idea behind APD is the usage of 39 high energy carrier to generate electronhole pairs. The avalanche process requires the initial electron to have energy greater than the bandgap energy.   Fig 2.8 Schematic of basic APD structure The APD usually has a very high gain because of the carrier multiplication.  On the other hand, the noise level of APD is also higher because the random process of carrier multiplication. The basic APD structure is shown in Fig 2.8. The multiplication rate of the APD is expressed as WMimpe 11  2.38 where imp  is the ionization coefficient and W is the width of multiplication region.  2.6 MetalSemiconductorMetal photodetector Another important class photodetector is metalsemiconductormetal photodetectorMSM. In recent years, MSM photodetectors have attracted many 40 interests in the field of optical interconnect. Speed and responsivity of MSM photdetector can be improved by resonant cavity.40    If only speed response is concerned, then ion implantation is a good choice.41 The traveling wave MSM photodetector exhibits both high speed and high quantum efficiency.11   bd Fig 2.9 Intedigitated contacts pattern of MSM photodetector In Fig. 2.9, the active area of a MSM photodetector is shown. In MSM photodetector active area, two Schottky barriers are placed in a planar geometry close to each other. The electrical contacts are placed as interdigitated manor. The active material is GaAs. The eleteode fingers are Au thin films. The structure of the electrode is interdigital, and the length b of the electrode is much larger than their width d. The thickness of the electrode fingers is much smaller than either their width 41 or their length, thus the fingers are theoretically considered infinitely thin. The number of the electrode fingers is large enough to allow neglecting the absence of symmetry at the electrode edges. Schottky barriers are formed at the interface between metal and semiconductor. Biasing voltage variations due to phodetector response are very small, so bias voltage is considered to be constant. The concentration of generated carriers depends on the optical signal intensity, the absorption coefficient  and the wavelength . As the optical coefficient curve in Fig. 2.10, low intensity optical signal is considered to avoid the carrier saturation in active area. The electrical field is not homogeneous and decrease shapely from the surface towards the bulk of the substrate. Drift mechanism dominates in the transport of photogenerated carriers in the part of the GaAs active area at the incident surface. At deeper region inside GaAs active area, the transport mechanism is governed by diffusion. Carrier recombination is neglected because the recombination time is much larger than the response time. Another assumption is the transport equation for two valley semiconductor.43    Carriers transport in each separated valley can be described by the driftdiffusion relation and the continuity equation, where the intervalley transfer is described by transfer times, according to hydrodynamic model.44 The transport equation is    12211111nn GnEnJdivqtn    2.39 42                             21122221nn GEnnJdivqtn   2.40              Fig. 2.10 Optical absorption coefficient of different semiconductor 43 pp GJdivqtp 1          2.41                            EqnJ n 111  Evs 11   2.42           111 sn vqnJ Evs 11          2.43       EqnJ n 222           Evs 22                  2.44                  222 sn vqnJ Evs 22                2.45       EqpJ pp    Ev psp   2.46  EqpJ spp    Ev psp   2.47        2.48 pnn JJJJ 21where n1 is the electron concentration in the  valley, n2 is the electron concentration in the  and L valley, p is the hole concentration, Jn1, Jn2 Jp are current densities,  is the carrier mobility of the material. Gn1, Gn2, Gp are the generation for electrons and holes in different valley of conduction band and valence band. E is the electrical field, and 1, 2 are the relaxation time in different valley of conduction band. 44 Bias variation caused by the impedance in the photodetector circuit can be neglected in comparison to the DC component of voltage, and it is possible to neglect the time variations of the electric field as well. The collected current by contacting finger is defined as the surface integral of the current density over an electrode.   dlnttyxDtyxJth os  ,,,,         2.49 where  is the electric induction vector and is the unit vector perpendicular to the electrode surface.

The response characterization from the physical processe point of the view is realized via carrier transit time, usually expressed as 3dB bandwidth. The carrier transit time is the parameter to characterize the mean time for generated carries to leave the detector.    45     0000snsnndtdlnJdtdlnJtT     2.51     0000spsppdtdlnJdtdlnJtT   2.52 where integral constant s denotes the electrode area through which electrons and holes leave the detector.   The 3 dB bandwidth frequency is used in practice to measure the response speed. The bandwidth frequency is obtained from the frequency response Hj which itself is the Fourier transform of htin equation 2.46  2max  jHjH B    2.53   46 Chapter 3  Silicon and GaAs MSM photodetectrors  3.1 Introduction MSM photodetectors are the receivers of optical interconnect system.  MSM photodetectors have been investigated extensively in recent years in close connections with optical interconnects. From fabrication point of view, there are MSM photodetectors having nanometer scale electrical finger contact.4547 These MSM photodetectors exhibits 3dB bandwidth in Terahertz range. The drawback of this approach is the difficulty in fabrication. Form view of detecting wavelength, there are MSM photodetectors which are sensitive in 1.3m and 1.5 m range.48,49 At shorter distance data communication, the light source with wavelength of 850 m is usually utilized and many researches of MSM photodetector have been conducted at this wavelength. One of the material choices for MSM photodetector is polysilicon.50 The advantage of this material is the simple fabrication process that is compatible with standard VLSI processes. The drawbacks of this approach is that 3 dB bandwidt is in megahertz range and quantum efficiency tends to be low, only 0.19AW. Another material choice of MSM photodetector is GaAs.51 Though GaAs MSM photodetecctor has Gigahertz range of 3dB bandwidth and responsivity is high, the challenge exists in the integration of GaAs MSM photodetector with VLSI electronics.  47  3.2.1 Thin film silicon based MSM photodetector Traditional electrical interconnections are approaching fundamental speed and density limitations. The integrated optoelectronic system would be the most realistic solution for these limitations. One of the preferred materials for individual components of integrated optoelectronics system is silicon for VLSI circuitry and optoelectronics, polymers for optical waveguides. Using the polymeric optical material for a particular application often can reduce the system cost and increases system performance. The fabrication challenge in integrated optoelectronics is to take the cost and performance advantages of these materials in a manufacturability manner.  One promising method for integrating semiconductor devices, both electronic and optoelectronic, with certain host substrates is thin film device integration. Single crystal, thin film semiconductor devices can be separated from the growth substrate and bonded to host substrate using standard microelectronic processes. It is an attractive option for multimaterial integrated optoelectronics. Multimaterial integrated systems, both electronic and optoelectronic, enable the system to perform at higher speed, consume less power, require less area for interconnects, and dissipate less heat. Optoelectronics has an opportunity not to compete with silicon, but to complement and augment the capabilities of silicon electronics. Recently, attention has been given to use optical technology to improve connection of devices on a single chip or wafer and between multichipmodulesMCM.52 Considering the widespread 48 proliferation of fiber networks into homes and businesses, lowcost and high reliability components will be required. Optoelectronics together with silicon circuitry meet this challenge by offering the potential advantages of large bandwidth, immunity from EMI and capacitive loading, and inherent parallelism.5355 The design of the thin film silicon detector is presented in Fig.3.1. The absorption coefficient of silicon is shown on Fig. 3.2. Silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor material, as illustrated in fig. 3.3. When the optical absorption happens, the lattice vibrations are needed to assist the electronhole pair generation.

Since the absorption length of 850 nm wavelength laser light in silicon is around 9 m, the total depth of the active silicon guarantees the total absorption of 850nm laser light. The distance between the contacting interdigitate fingers is 2 m.   By the onedimensional approximation, the energyband structure of MSM photodetector under different bias voltages can be illustrated as in Fig.3.4. Obviously, when the external bias voltage equals to zero, the photogenerated carriers will be restricted within the potential well formed by the two Schottky junctions. So, the detector has no response to the optical signal. As VgEbias increasing, the depletion region on left side the electron potential is higher will expand and finally occupies the whole semiconductor area. This is the case b in Fig.3.4, however, the potential well still exist. The photoncurrent will not be produced until the lowest point of the electron potential curve moves to the right metalsemiconductor interface through increasing Vbias further. That is the case shown in Fig.3.4 c. This electron potential function in the depletion region can be solved from the Poisson equation. The following threshold bias voltage for photoncurrent generation can be obtained  51 Vbiasqe Nd. d2.2    3.2 where, Nd is the donor impurity density in Ntype semiconductor area, d is the width of the depletion region, qe is the electron charge.

The fabrication of 1x12 thin film MSM silicon photodetector array device started with 100 ntype silicon wafers of 612 cm sheet resistance. The silicon wafer was first mechanically polished from its original thickness of 500 m to around 50 m thick. Then the backside of the 52 wafer was glued on the transferring substrate that used as a mechanical support.  The wafer surface was cleaned with HF in a supersonic bath for 30 seconds. Then the wafer was rinsed in DI water for five minutes. The wafer later was in a supersonic bath with acetone for 10 minutes, followed by a supersonic bath with Isopropanol for five minutes. Finally the wafer was rinsed in DI water for five minutes and then baked at a 150C oven for 10 minutes to get rid of water residue on surface. This cleaning procedure was to ensure that the thin layer of SiO2 was etched away and the wafer surface was clean. Immediately after the cleaning procedure, the wafer was deposited with 1000  SiO2 using physical enhanced chemical vapor deposition PECVD. The photoresist, AZ 5209, was spin coated on the wafer at 4000 revolutionperminute RPM for 40 seconds. The wafer then underwent soft bake900C, 20 minutes. The sample was then illuminated under KarlSuess mask aligner for 40 seconds with mask pattern. As a result the interdigitated finger pattern was fabricated on top of the silicon dioxide layer. The electrode pattern was revealed after the wafer was being developed for 35 seconds using AZ 425 developer. This is followed by a 1200C 20 minutes hard backing.  The interdigitate finger pattern has to be opened all the way down to the silicon surface. In order to etch away SiO2 on the silicon surface, reactive ion etching RIE was used. Not only the dry etching method provides good surface condition, but also the vertical profile of the interdigitate finger pattern is guaranteed. The 53 interdigitate finger pattern was etched on a Lam 760 RIE system and the following is the receipt.   Pressure  20 m  Oxygen 25 sccm  CF4  10sccm  RF Power 75W  Etching rate 500  min  Mask  PR After etching away rest area of SiO2, finger pattern was formed. The 1500  Au was then deposited on the pattern of the device using CHA ebeam evaporation machine. The interdigitate finger pattern was preserved and the rest of the gold was removed by lift off procedure, which composed of emerging sample in acetone and ultrasonic bath for 30 seconds and then rinsed with DI water. Figure 3.5 shows an interdigitate finger pattern after the lift off process.    54  Fig. 3.5 Etched contact finger pattern of MSM thin film photodetector  After the deposition of interdigitate finger electrode contact, the wafer was again spin coated with photo resist, AZ 5209 at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. The sample was again undergone softbaked at 90C for ten minute. The sample was aligned with contacting pad pattern mask and illuminated under KarlSuess mask aligner for 40 55 seconds. The sample was hard baked in the oven under 1200C for 20 minutes. The electrode pattern was revealed after being developed for 35 seconds using AZ 425 developer. A layer of 1500 thick Au was deposited by CHA electron beam evaporator. The final contacting pad was revealed when the unnecessary gold was removed by emerging sample in acetone and ultrasonic bath for 30 seconds and then rinsed with DI water. The active area of MSM thin film photodetector and finished MSM photodetector with contact pad are shown in figure 3.6. The 1x12 thin film array MSM silicon photodetector was finally thinned down to around 10 m by RIE etching process.

When metal is deposited on the surface of semiconductor, interface between metal and semiconductor emerges. The Schottkey barrier arises when current flows from the metal into the semiconductor in order to come to equilibrium.56,57 The electrons flow only around nanometer range into semiconductor and leave space charges that forms physical barrier to electrons, therefore prevent any current flow in between the two materials. The formation of Schottkey barrier is illustrated in figure 3.7. The height of the Schottkey barrier is express as  smb     3.3 where b is defined as the Schottkey barrier height, m is the work function of metal  and s electron affinity of the semiconductor. The work function of Au is 4.58 eV and the electron affinity of silicon is 4.01eV, as in figure 3.7. So the theoretical Schottkey barrier height is 0.57eV. The formation of the Schottkey barrier is demonstrated by the IV curve of the silicon MSM photodetector. The IV of the device was measured using IV curve tracer. The result is shown on figure 3.8 and the breaking voltage is 10 volts.   When apply voltage between the anode and the cathode of MSM photodetector, there is a very small electrical current even without the lamination of light. This small electrical current is defined as dark current. The origin which contributes to the dark current is due to thermionic emission.5859 from the theory of thermionic emission, the hot electrons with energy equal to or larger than the 59 conduction band energy at the metalsemiconductor interface cross the metal semiconductor interface and induce the dark current.

In order to measure the dark current of the thin film MSM photodetector, HP4641 semiconductor analyzer was used. The HP4641 semiconductor analyzer has a testing chamber, which can be closed to prevent light going into the chamber, and the chamber was kept totally darkness while the test was made. The dark current of thin film silicon MSM photodetector at 5 volts bias voltage was 82.9 nA.  The responsivity of thin film MSM photodetector is defined as ratio between the current generated by the light absorption over the total power of the light that applied to the detector. The responsivity of the thin film MSM photodetector was measure through the photocurrent and the total power applied to the photodetector. The responsivity value of the thin film MSM photodetector was 0.25AW at wavelength 850nm. 62  Another important characteristic of thin film MSM photodetector is its 3dB bandwidth. The 3dB bandwidth can be calculated by solving dependent continuity equation and is expressed as following  ktpktndaph CeeewLLLRqAVtI kpnk 11       3.8  where A is the area of the active area, Va is the effective applied voltage, R is the surface reflectivity,  is the light absorption coefficient, d is the thickness of absorption length, L is the length of the finger space, W is the finger width, n  is the electron mobility, p is the hole mobility, Ck is given as 222211112 kdeekALEECdkdkphpulsek  3.9 and  1 22 dkDnkn     1 22 dkDpk p   in which Dn and Dp are the diffusion constants of electrons and holes respectively.  Theoretically, the 3dB bandwidth is hard to calculate because of the effective voltage applied between electrodes is difficult to calculate. To clarify this matter, the effective voltage applied on the active area of thin film photodetector is the voltage underneath the surface of the silicon. The distribution of electrical field inside silicon does not 63 linearly decrease form the top to the boundary of absorption length. The electrical field was strong near the surface of the thin film of silicon and decrease exponentially with the increase of the thickness of the silicon. The best way to decide 3dB bandwidth is to measure it experimentally.    The impulse measurement of thin film silicon MSM photodetector was performed in the lab. The setup included Tisapphire modelocked femtosecond laser operates at the wavelength 850nm with a pulse width of about 150fs and a repetition rate of 76MHz. The optical attenuator was used to attenuate the laser power from its original 200mW to 10mW. The pulse of the modelock is very unstable if optical isolator is not used. The reason for that instability of the laser pulse is when the laser pulse is coupled into multimode fiber end, the   64 DUTThin film Si MSMPhotodetector  Cascade  Microwave Multi Mode Femtosecond Laser Biasing Optical HP Spectrum DC Voltage   Fig. 3.10 Measurement setup for test of thin film silicon MSM photodetector  65    DC Voltage Cascade  Microwave Multi Mode  DUTThin film Si MSM Photodetector HP Spectrum Fig. 3.11 Measurement setup and test of thin film silicon MSM photodetector  collimating lens of the multimode fiber reflects large mount of the laser energy back into the cavity of the laser system. The reflected energy of the original laser pulse greatly disturbed the mode locking mechanism of the Tisapphire laser. For that reason, a 30dB optical isolator was also used in the measurement setup. It was discovered later that the optical isolator could be could if the pulse laser light is coupled off center into the multi mode fiber deliberately. In that way the collimating lens reflects most energy of the laser light back into space and only very small 66 amount of the energy reflects back into laser system and dose not incur big disturbance of the modelocking mechanism. After passing through optical attenuator and optical isolator, the pulse laser light was butt coupled into one end of the multi mode optical fiber. The multi mode optical fiber was then routed through a mechanical holder onto the top of the thin film MSM silicon photodetector. The fiber tip was directed vertically on the very surface of active area of the thin film MSM silicon photodetector. A 40 GHz groundsignalground GSG microwave probe was used for electrical signal extraction. A 100k18GHz biasing tee was connected to the microwave probe and biasing voltage was provided by the DC power supply. Between the power supply and biasing tee, an ampere meter was serially connected in the circuit. The tip of the multi mode fiber was first brought to the vicinity area of the active part of the photodetector, then the tip of the fiber was moved slowly and at the same time, the readout of the ampere meter was carefully monitored, validation of the pulse lasers vertical illuminating on the active area of the MSM photodetector was confirmed by the existence of the photocurrent, usually around 3050 A. Finally a 9k26GHz spectraanalyzer was connected through high frequency cable to the GSG microwave probe. The 3dB bandwidth was read out from spectraanalyzer. The whole measurement setup diagram and test are shown in figure 3.10 and 3.11. The biasing voltage of the thin film MSM silicon photodetector was 5V. The 3dB bandwidth was 350 MHz, as shown in figure 3.12.  67   0.00E000 1.00E008 2.00E008 3.00E008 4.00E00871.070.570.069.569.068.568.067.567.066.566.065.565.064.564.063.5 B BAmplitudedBFrequencyHzAmplitudedBFig 3.12 3dB bandwidth of thin film silicon MSM photodetector  3.3.1 GaAs MSM phodetector  Silicon MSM photdetector has the advantage of being able to integrate with VLSI circuit without extra fabrication steps to accommodate since most VLSI circuits is fabricated on silicon wafer. One big drawback of silicon MSM thin film photodetector is the slow response in speed. The 3dB bandwidth only reached 350 68 MHz in abovementioned thin film MSM silicon photodetector. Even consider the 12detector array, the aggregated bandwidth was 4.25GHz. The slow response time of silicon MSM photodetector results from the inherent absorption length of silicon at 850 nm wavelength. That absorption length is around 9 m. When biasing voltage is applied on the surface of the silicon, it drops very quickly inside silicon with the increase of thedepth. So the electronhole pairs generated at the end of the absorption length acquire very weak electrical field and therefore the drifting velocity is slow. This effect contributes to the slow 3dB bandwidth of thin film MSM silicon photdetector. If the active depth of the silicon is dramatically reduced to less than onemicron meter the speed response would be considerably increased. However silicon is an indirect band gap semiconductor it does not absorb light efficiently through short length. Also when silicon material absorbs light, in order to fulfill the requirement of the conservation of momentum, the lattice vibration and phonon absorption have to be added with the momentum of the electron.   GaAs is an ideal material for the optoelectronic device. At 850 nm wavelength, the absorption coefficient of GaAs is much larger than that of silicon material. As a result, the absorption length of GaAs is an order less than that of silicon. The band structure of GaAs is shown on figure 3.13. The band gap energy of GaAs is  204104.5519.124eVTTEg   3.10 69  the electron mass in GaAs is me0.067m0 and light hole mass is mh0.08 m0.     Fig. 3.13 Band structure of GaAs  70   At 300 K, intrinsic carrier concentration of GaAs is 1.84x106 cm3. At room temperature the band gap energy of GaAs is  1.423 eV. The design of MSM GaAs photodetector is illustrated in figure 3.14. This design is not much different from the schematic design of thin film silicon MSM photodetector. The deference gE 500 m GaAs1000  SiO2 1000  SiO2 1000  SiO2Au Au3000 Metal contact  Fig 3.14 Design of GaAs MSM photodetector  lies on the fact that the absorption length at given wavelength 850 nm of GaAs is much shorter than that of silicon MSM photodetector. The interdigitate finger width and the width of finger are all 2 m. The MSM GaAs photodetectors are designed to 71 be 1x12 array. The centertocenter distances between individual detectors are 250 m. Each detector in the array has an active area of 50x50m. The contacting metal used to form Schottkey barrier is Au. When there is no biasing voltage applied to the MSM GaAs photodetector, the detector acts as two backtoback diodes. If the 850 nm pulse laser light is illuminated on the active area of MSM photodetector, the electronhole pairs will be generated and restricted between the potentials formed by two Schottkey barriers. When small biasing voltage is applied to both ends of Schottkey barrier, the conduction band and the valence band will tilt according to the voltage applied. When applied voltage is large enough to totally bend the conduction and the valence band, the Schottkey barrier will disappear on anode side and electrons can flow from conduction band to anode terminal, and Schottkey barrier will also disappear on cathod side and holes can flow from the valence band to cathode terminal. Since the absorption length of GaAs is much smaller than silicon, a better 3dB bandwidth is anticipated because the electronhole pairs are generated much nearer to GaAs surface as compared with those electronhole pairs generated under the silicon surface. Another factor of better 3dB bandwidth is the faster electron and hole mobility in GaAs material. The electron and hole mobility in GaAs material are 8500 cm 2 Vs and 400 cm 2 Vs respectively, compared with 1400 cm2 V1s1 and 450 cm2 V1s1 electron and hole mobility in silicon material. The electronic properties of GaAs is listed in table 3.1    72  Fabrication of GaAs MSM photodetector array was much alike the fabrication of thin film silicon MSM photodetector array. The wafer is Liquid Encapsulation Czochralski LEC grow 100 semiinsulating GaAs that has bulk resistivity of 108m. The fabrication procedures were taken in class 100 cleanroom. The surface of GaAs wafer was first cleaned with DI water. Then the wafer was Table 3.1 Room temperature properties of GaAs Property Parameter Crystal structure Zinc blende Lattice constant 5.65  Density 5.32 gcm 3 Atomic density 4.5  10 22 atomscm 3 Molecular weight 144.64 Bulk modulus 7.55  10 11 dyncm 2 Sheer modulus  3.26  10 11 dyncm 2 Coefficient of thermal expansion 5.8  10 6 K 1 Specific heat 0.327 JgK Lattice thermal conductivity 0.55 WcmC Dielectric constant 12.85 Band gap 1.42 eV Threshold field 3.3 kVcm 73 Peak drift velocity 2.1  10 7 cms Electron mobility undoped 8500 cm 2 Vs Hole mobility undoped 400 cm 2 Vs Melting point 1238C cleaned in a supersonic bath of acetone for 10 minutes, followed by a supersonic bath of Isopropanol for five minutes. The wafer was rinsed by DI water for 5 minutes and then baked at a 150C oven for 10 minutes to get rid of water residue. After cleaning process, 1000  SiO2 was deposited on the GaAs surface by PECVD. This layer of SiO2 was used as the insulation layer between pad and active area of GaAs. The photoresist, AZ 5209 was spin coated on the top of SiO2 layer. The RPM of the spin was 4000 and the time of spine coating was 40 seconds. The wafer then went through 900C 20 minutes soft bake curing. The finger pattern was formed on the GaAs wafer though photolithography process, which was shined UV light for 40 seconds through KarlSuess mask aligner. The interdigitate finger pattern appeared after 20 seconds develop time using AZ 425 developer. The wafer went on 1200C, 20 minutes hard backing.   In order for the electrode finger pattern touch the surface of the active area of GaAs wafer, finger part of SiO2 has to be etched away. SiO2 was wet etched by 16 oxide etchant. This was followed by Au metal deposition that was performed through CHA ebeam evaporation machine. After depositing Au on the wafer, the Au finger pattern was preserved and the rest of gold was taken off by liftoff process. The liftoff 74 process involved emerging sample in acetone and ultrasonic bath for 30 seconds, then rinsed with DI water. Because the photoresist was highly resolvable in acetone, the area of the Au, which was on top of photoresist and had no contact with the surface of GaAs, became loosen from the wafer and later was moved away by ultrasonic bath. Figure 3.15 shows an interdigitate finger pattern of Au after the lift off process. The space between two interdigitated fingers is 2 m.   Fig 3.15 Contacting finger pattern of GaAs MSM photodetector   75 The fabrication of contacting pad of MSM GaAs photdetector array was followed after the formation of interdigitate fingers. The wafer was first spin coated with photo resist, AZ 5209 at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. Then it was put into oven and softbaked at 90C for ten minute. The sample was aligned with contacting pad pattern mask under KarlSuess mask aligner and was shined with UV light for 40 seconds. The sample was hard baked in the oven under 1200C for 20 minutes. The pattern was developed using AZ 425 developer. After the pattern formation, 1500  Au pad material was deposited by CHA electron beam evaporator. The final contacting pad was revealed when the unnecessary gold was removed by emerging sample in acetone and underwent ultrasonic bath for 30 seconds and then rinsed with DI water. The whole process of fabricating 112 GaAs MSM photodetector array is similar to that of silicon MSM photodetector array except that in GaAs photodetector fabrication, the wet etching of SiO2 was used instead of RIE etching. The whole fabrication process of GaAs MSM photodetector array can be referenced through figure 3.7. The interdigitate finger pattern of GaAs MSM photodetector and array of photodetector are shown in figure 3.16 and figure 3.17 respectively.       76  Fig. 3.16 Interdigitate finger pattern of GaAs MSM photdetector  Fig. 3.17. Array of GaAs MSM photodetector  77 3.3.2  Testing of GaAs MSM photodetector array   When Au is deposit on the surface of GaAs surface, interface arises between metal and semiconductor. Because of the difference between the work function of metal and electron affinity of semiconductor, Schottkey barrier forms at the interface of metal and semiconductor. The schottkey barrier height is defined as the difference between the metal work function and the semiconductors electron affinity. The value of work function of Au is 4.58 eV. The value of electron affinity of GaAs is 4.07eV. The theoretical value of Schottkey barrier is 0.51eV. The formation of the Schottkey barrier at the interface of GaAs and Au is demonstrated by the IV curve of the GaAs MSM photodetector. The IV curve characteristic was measured using IV curve tracer. The IV curve clearly demonstrates rectifying characteristic and the breakdown voltage was 15 volts.  Another important characteristic of GaAs MSM photodetector is dark current. Even without the illumination of light, there is small current flow between cathode and anode of GaAs photodetector when the biasing voltage is applied. The dark current is due to thermionic emission of electrons in GaAs. The hot electrons with energy equal to or larger than the conduction band energy at the metalsemiconductor interface cross the metal semiconductor interface and induce the dark current. The formula to express dark current is shown in equation 3.7. To measure dark current of GaAs photodetector, HP4641 semiconductor analyzer was used. In the process of 78 measuring dark measurement, the device under test was kept in total darkness. The dark current of GaAs MSM photodetector at 5 volts bias voltage was 4.6 pA.  The responsivity of GaAs MSM photodetector is defined as ratio between the current generated by the light absorption over the total power of the light that applied to the GaAs MSM photodetector. The responsivity of the GaAs MSM photodetector was measured through the photocurrent and the total power applied to the photodetector. The responsivity value of the GaAs MSM photodetector was 0.32AW at wavelength 850nm.  Another important characteristic of thin film MSM photodetector is its 3dB bandwidth. The 3dB bandwidth can be calculated by solving dependent continuity equation and is expressed in equation 3.8. The limitation of the 3dB bandwidth is the electrons and holes transit time needed from the location they are generated to the contacting fingers. Since the absorption length in GaAs is much shorter than that in silicon, the electrons and holes can be generated in location much near to electron contacting fingers and they experience much stronger electrical field. Also taken into account of electron and hole mobility in GaAs are higher than those in silicon. The 3dB bandwidth of GaAs photodetector is to be higher than that of silicon photodetector. The 3dB bandwidth is also related closely with applied voltage between interdigitate fingers, because the transit time of electrons and hole decreases with the increase of the applied voltage. However, there is an upper limit when the applied voltage is so large that the saturation speeds of hole and electron are reached.  79 The impulse measurement of GaAs MSM photodetector was performed in the lab. The instruments of the setup include Tisapphire modelocked femtosecond laser operates at the wavelength 850nm with a pulse width of about 150fs and a repetition rate of 76MHz. Other instruments are optical isolator, optical attenuator, and multi mode optical fiber. The fiber tip was directed vertically on the very surface of active area of the MSM GaAs photodetector. The electrical signal was extracted through a 40 GHz groundsignalground GSG microwave probe. The 100k18GHz biasing tee was connected to the microwave probe and the biasing voltage was provided by the DC power supply. Between biasing tee and DC power supply, an ampere meter was serially connected in the circuit. Another end of biasing tee was connected to the HP spectraanalyzer. The tip of multi mode fiber was moved back and forth slowly around the vicinity and at the same time, the readout of the ampere meter was carefully monitored. Validation of the pulse laser light vertical illumination on the active area of GaAs MSM photodetector was confirmed by the existence of the photocurrent, usually around 50100 A.  In the measurement of 3dB bandwidth, the coupling of laser light to multi mode fiber was deliberately distorted to decrease the coupling efficiency of the pulse laser light. There were two reasons for the deliberately distort the coupling of laser and multi mode fiber. One reason was that by tilt fiber on purpose, the collimate lens of multi mode fiber did not reflect pulse laser light directly back into Tisapphire laser system and therefore the mode locking mechanism was not disturbed. Another reason 80 was that by distort the coupling between pulsed laser and multi mode fiber, great amount of laser energy was diverted and only small portion was fed into the active area of GaAs MSM photodetector, therefore the detector did not get saturated upon measuring.  The whole set up diagram and experiment apparatus lay out can be referenced in Fig. 3.10 and Fig. 3.11. The 3dB bandwidth of GaAs MSM photodetector was measured under 5V biasing voltage and the read out of the spectraanalyzer was 2.6 GHz. For the 112 GaAs MSM photodetector array, the aggregated 3dB bandwidth was 32 GHz              81 1G 2G 3G 4G 5G11109876542.648GHzAmplitudeFrequencyFig 3.18 2.6 GHz 3dB bandwidth of GaAs MSM photodetector 82 Chapter 4   Epitaxial liftoff GaAs MSM photodetector array    4.1 Introduction.  Optical waveguide has an enormous capability for transmitting digital information. One channel waveguide is able to transmit several Gagabitssec light pulse signal.60,61 In todays fast moving computation speed in computer industry, there is an accelerated trend to increase CPUs speed to match up with Moors Law. The intrinsic limitation of the present generation of computer has encouraged researcher to seriously consider other computer architecture that uses optical interconnects as main component. The basic limitations of electrical interconnects include interconnection time, clock skew, resistance and capacitance time constants and electromagneticinterference EMI radiation.62,63 Optical interconnect has been vigorously pursued as a better choice for the interconnecting different processors and memories whenever the conventional electrical interconnect can not meet the system requirements. Other components in an optical interconnect system are optical sources and optical receivers. Since CPU and other digital components are fabricated on the silicon wafer, the first initiative would be to fabricate optical source and optical receiver from silicon. Usually 850 nm light is used in short distance optical interconnection.64,65 At 850 nm wavelength, silicon is not efficient in absorbing light 83 and the absorption length is extremely long. Also because the silicon material is an indirect band gap semiconductor, when 850 nm light illuminates silicon, electron hole pairs are not efficiently generated. In order to keep momentum conservation, phonons assistance are required if electron hole pairs are to be generated. For the optical source, silicon is not a suitable material either. There is no laser source fabricated by silicon up to date. The reason is the characteristics of the indirect band gap semiconductor. There is near impossible to generate stimulated emission from silicon. The suitable material for semiconductor lasers and photodetectors is GaAs. GaAs is a direct bandgap semiconductor and stimulated emission is easy to be obtained.66,67 For photodetectors perspective, the light absorption length with 850nm wavelength in GaAs material is short, and the direct bandgap characteristics of GaAs ensure an efficient excitation for photon to generate electron hole pairs. The difficulty to utilize GaAs into VLSI system lies in the different fabrication process between GaAs and silicon. Also GaAs and silicon are dopants of each other, which means that Ga and As atoms are considered to be contaminants of silicon material and vice versa. The only way to cooperate GaAs device with VLSI silicon circuit is by afterwards integration. The GaAs device has to be fabricated before it is integrated into VLSI system.  Because the fully embedded optical interconnect system has to have the ability to be inserted among the layers of Printed Circuit Board PCB, the photodetector and semiconductor laser have to be fabricated in thin film formation. Most microelectronic devices utilize only a thin layer near the surface of a semiconductor wafer, in MetalOxideSemiconductor MOS devices for example, 84 the first few hundred nanometers from the top of the wafer are used for electron transport.68,69  The remainder of the several hundred micrometers in wafer thickness, almost exclusively, serves as mechanical support for the devices. Electrical interaction between devices and substrate may lead to a number of detrimental parasitic effects.  In addition, the conductive bulk substrate makes the full dielectric insulation of independent neighboring components difficult as a consequence parasitic devices may become active. Fabricating devices in a thin layer offers a variety of advantages, many of which result from the reduction or elimination of unwanted parasitic interaction among the devices and the bulk substrate.70 A direct approach to integrate silicon with GaAs is heteroepitaxy growth using MOCVD or MBE. In reality, this approach is very expensive and time consuming since a silicon foundry has to be developed to allow such growth in conjunction with process of silicon VLSI circuit. As mentioned above, silicon and GaAs are dopants to each other. In another words they are mutual contamination for each other. Another difficulty lies in the different lattice structure of these two semiconductors, and when one kind material is grown on the other material as the substrate, large amounts of defects, including dislocations exist and degrade greatly the device performance and yield.  4.2 Thin film MSM phodector arry by epitaxial liftoff technique In order to obtain thin film GaAs photodetector, epitaxial liftoff technique was used. The technique relies on the separation of a thin film of epiGaAs from its 85 substrate, followed by direct bonding of the thin film to a host substrate. The first successful epitaxial liftoff GaAs thin film was reported by Yablonovitch.71 Since then, this technique has been used widely by different research group to demonstrate novel devices.7275 The mechanism of epitaxially liftoff thin film is to use the 11000 HF etching rate between GaAs and AlAs. Usually a thin layer of AlAs is grown     Black waxGaAs device   AlAs sacrificial layerDilute HFGaAs substrate  Fig 4.1 Step one of epitaxial liftoff thin film GaAs device 86  PressureBlack Thin film GaAs device   H2O Host substrate Fig 4.2 Step two of epitaxial liftoff thin film GaAs device  between substrate GaAs and epi layer of GaAs. There are two steps in the process as illustrated in Fig. 4.1 and fig.4.2. A thick layer of black wax was melted on top of the thin film device to give the device mechanical strength and handling capability after the thin film was detached from its substrate. The layer of black wax also protects the top surface of the thin film device.  The whole sample was then emerged in 10 HF for a period of time until sacrificial layer was totally etched away. At this point thin film device would be separated from its substrate. The thin film device covered with black wax at the top was then picked up from the solution of HF. It was first rinsed 87 thoroughly with DI water and left to naturally dry for a period of time. Because the mechanical support of the black wax, the thin film device was not difficult to handle. The second step is to bond the GaAs thin film device to the host substrate. There is the more critical step as the quality of adhesion affects yield directly. In the ideal condition, strong adhesion is necessary to achieve good bonding. Glue less bonding process is used to bond the thin film GaAs device to the host material. After bonding to the host substrate, thin film device has to withstand later fabrication steps that are needed to make electrical contact to other components on the PCB. It also has to have good thermal conductivity. In the glue less bonding method, the mechanism of bonding depends on the type of substrate surface on which the thin film device was later transferred. The bonding force was Van der Waals forces between thin film device and host substrate. In this case, both surfaces of substrate and thin film device had to be as flat as possible.  The thin film GaAs device can be processed before epitaxial liftoff as well as after epitaxial liftoff. In the procedure of fabricating device before epitaxial liftoff, the thin film device has to be aligned with other features on the substrate and components which it will later be integrated with. In the procedure of fabricating device after the epitaxial liftoff, the thin film bonded to the substrate requires no precise alignment when it is fabricated. Howeveer, after fabricating the thin film device and integrating with other components of the system, the thin film device on the substrate still requires precise alignment with other components. For this reason, all thin film device fabrications are done before epitaxial liftoff and bonding.  88  4.3 Design and fabrication of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector  All VLSI circuitry and optoelectronic devices are fabricated on either silicon or IIIV semiconductor amterial. Usually the thickness of silicon wafer and IIIV semiconductor wafer is 500700 m, but only a thin layer from top of the substrate surface is utilized for electron transport. The rest several hundred micronmeters in thickness of the wafer serve as the mechanical support. The design of thin film MSM GaAs photodetector is based on the fact that the absorption length of 850 nm wavelength light is around 2 m in GaAs material. Also the lattice constant of AlAs and GaAs are comparable and these two materials can be grown epitaxially on each other. Another fact concerning epitaxial liftoff is that the HF etching rate of GaAs and AlAs approaches 10001. The design of original device and finished thin film GaAs MSM photodetector are shown in Fig. 4.3 and Fig. 4.4. GaAs is a direct band gap semiconductor material, the light absorption could be more efficient to generate electronhole pairs. The 850 nm wavelength light is totally absorbed in 2 m distance from the top surface. The thin film GaAs MSM photodetector is designed to be 1 m thick of its active layer. The lost efficiency is compensated by reflection of light from the silver layer at the bottom of thin film device. The reflectivity of silver at 850 nm wavelength is 94. So this 1m thick thin film GaAs MSM photdetector has an effective light absorbing layer equal to 2 m. The thinner active layer also increase 89    3000 Metal contact Au Au1000  SiO2 1000  SiO2 1000  SiO2 1 m GaAs 2000  AlAs GaAs Substrate Fig. 4.3 Design of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector  the effective electrical field inside GaAs active area without sacrificing the efficiency of detector. The increased electrical field facilitates the electron and hole transit time, which result in higher 3dB bandwidth compared with the conventional GaAs MSM photodetector having the normal 2 m absorption length.          90  3000 Metal contact Au Au1000  SiO2 1000  SiO2 1000  SiO2 1 m GaAs   1000  Ag Fig. 4.4 Design of epitaxial liftoff thin film GaAs MSM photodetector   The top 1 m active area of GaAs and 1000  AlAs are epitaxially grown on 100 GaAs wafer. Array of GaAs MSM photodetector was first fabricated before the epitaxial liftoff. The fabrication of GaAs MSM photodetector is very similar with fabrication of thin film silicon MSM photodetector and conventional GaAs MSM photodetector. The fabrication processes were performed in class100 clean room. The surface of GaAs wafer was first cleaned with DI water. It was followed by 10 minutes supersonic bath with acetone and 5 minutes supersonic bath with Isopropanol. The wafer was rinsed by DI water for 5 minutes and then baked at a 91 120C oven for 10 minutes to evaporate excessive water residue. Following the cleaning process, 1000  SiO2 was deposited on the GaAs surface by PECVD. The photoresist, AZ 5209 was spin coated on the top of SiO2 layer. The RPM of the spin was 4000 and the time of spine coating was 40 seconds. The wafer then went through 900C, 20 minutes soft bake curing.  Photolithography step was followed to form the pattern of interdigitate finger contacts. This was followed by 1200C 20 minutes hard backing. In order for the electrode finger pattern touch the surface of the active area of GaAs wafer, finger part of SiO2 has to be etched away. SiO2 was wet etched by 16 oxide etchant. The 1500 Au was then deposited on the surface of epiGaAs wafer using CHA ebeam evaporator. The Au interdigitate finger pattern was defined by liftoff unwanted Au from other place of GaAs surface. The finished interdigitate finger pattern has finger spacing 2 m.   After the deposition of interdigitate finger, the formation of contacting pad was followed. The wafer was first spin coated with photo resist, AZ 5209 at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. Then it was put into oven and softbaked at 90C for ten minute. Then the pattern of contacting pad was aligned with interdigitate finger through KarlSuess mask aligner. After the successful alignment of contacting pad with interdigitate finger, 40 seconds UV light was shined on the sample and the pattern of pad was defined. The pattern was formed after the sample was developed in AZ 425 developer 92 for 20 seconds and followed by 1500 Au deposition through CHA electron beam evaporator. Final step was to liftoff unnecessary gold pad material by emerging sample in acetone and ultrasonic bath for 30 seconds and then rinsed off with DI water. After the fabrication of GaAs MSM photodetector on the epiwafer, the epitaxial liftoff process was followed to obtain thin film device. The surface of the device was first covered with molten black wax. Black wax was chosen because it was easy to be handled and later to be cleaned away. It acted as the mechanical support of the thin film device and the protection of the device surface. The black wax at the edge of the device was carefully cleaned away by trichloroethylene. The sample was then dipped into 10 HF for a period of time while it was carefully monitored. Because the large different HF etching ratio between AlAs and GaAs, the 1000  thick AlAs sacrificial layer was gradually etch away while at the same time the integrity of thin film GaAs was preserved. When the sacrificial layer was totally etched away, the thin film device will separated from the rest of the substrate. The thin film device was transferred out of the HF solution and was rinsed with DI water. The thin film device was preserved in a container to let it dry naturally.  After the thin film was dry completely, a layer of 1500  thick silver was deposited on the back end of the device through electron beam evaporator. The function of this silver layer was to reflect 850 nm light back to GaAs. Because the thickness of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector is 1 m and 2 m is the effective 93 absorption length of 850 nm wavelength light in GaAs, the light is reflected back into GaAs to make the 1 m real thickness to be effectively 2 m thick. Upon finishing the deposition of thin layer of silver, the surface of the silver was intentionally   Fig 4.5 finished thin film MSM GaAs photodetector 94  moistened with water vapor. The surface of the silver was pressed to the surface of glass and moderate pressure was applied for a period of time. Finally the black wax was removed by trichloroethylene. The finished thin film GaAs MSM photodetector is presented in figure 4.5. The whole process of fabricating and wpitaxial liftoff thin film GaAs MSM photodetector is shown in figure 4.6.  4.4 Characterization of thin film GaAs photodetector The first measurement of thin film GaAs photodetedtor was its IV characteristic. The IV characteristic was used to demonstrate its schottkey barrier and rectify feature. Schottkey barrier forms at the interface of metal and GaAs and its value is the difference between the value of work function of Au and the value of electron affinity of GaAs. The IV curve characteristic was measured using IV curve tracer. The IV curve clearly demonstrates rectifying characteristic and the breakdown voltage was 13 volts. The slightly decrease of the breakdown voltage of thin film GaAs pdotodetector compared with normal GaAs photodetector might due to the thickness decrease of the photdetector active area. This decrease of thickness increases the effective electrical field in active area and as a consequence it generates more hot electrons in the process.  Another IV characteristic of GaAs MSM photodetector is its dark current. The dark current was also measured by HP4641 semiconductor analyzer. In GaAs photodetector, majority of electron and hole pairs are generated by the energy 95   Fig 4.6 Process of fabrication and epitaxial liftoff thin film GaAs MSM photodetector 96  absorbed from 850 nm laser light. Beside the electron and hole pairs resulted in form absorbing energy of laser light, there are small amount of electron hole pairs generated form thermionic emission of electrons from the valence band into the conduction band. The formula to describe thermionic emission is equation 3.7.  The demonstration of thermionic emission is the existence of dark current. The dark current was measured when the device was in total darkness. The dark current of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector was 5.7 pA under 5V biasing voltage. Compare with the dark current value of conventional GaAs MSM photodetector under the same basing voltage, there was a 1.1 pA increase. The reason of that increase was due to the dramatically thickness decrease of photodetectors active region. Because the decrease of the active region thickness, the applied effective voltage was increased and that increase contributes higher value of dark current. The responsivity of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector was measured in the lab. The resposivity of photodector is defined as the ratio of the current produced by the absorbing energy of 850 nm laser light, to the amount of light energy falling on the detector. The resposivity of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector was measured as 0.25 AW. The slight drop of the detector resposivity to the value of conventional GaAs MSM photodetector was due to the 1 m effective length of thin film device.  The total absorption length of 850 nm wavelength light in GaAs is 2m. The design of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector results in a thickness of active region to 97 be 1m. In order to compensate the 50 decrease of the total absorption length, one layer of silver was deposited on the back of the thin film GaAs MSM photodetector. The reflectivity of silver to 850 nm laser light is 94 which compensates the thickness of active region to be a light less than 2 m. Another reason for the drop of resposivity might due to the much higher effective electrical field in the active region of the photdetector, the higher effective electrical field might cause the detector to be saturated.    The temporal response of thin thin film GaAs MSM photdetector was measured through its 3dB bandwidth. The formula to express 3dB bandwidth is in equation 3.8. The limitation of 3dB bandwidth is the electrons and holes transit time needed from the location they are generated to the contacting electrode. The instruments for 3dB bandwidth measurement include Tisapphire modelocked femtosecond laser operating at the wavelength 850nm with a pulse width of about 150fs and a repetition rate of 76MHz.The energy of laser was attenuated before it was fed into a multi mode fiber. An optical isolator was also used between the fiber and laser to block the back reflection of laser energy from the collimating lens of the fiber. The fiber tip was directed vertically on the vicinity surface of active area of thin film MSM GaAs photodetector.  The contacting pad was probed by a 40 GHz groundsignalground GSG microwave probe. A 100k18GHz biasing tee was connected to the probe and it 98 provided biasing voltage through a DC voltage supply. An ampere meter was connected between biasing tee and the probe to monitor the photocurrent. A 40G highspeed cable was connected between biasing tee and HP spectraanalyzer. The diagram of whole measurement setup can be referenced in Fig. 3.10. A microscope was used to observe the probe when it was guided to the detectors metal pad. After the tip of the fiber was moved to the vicinity of active area of the detector, the read out of ampere meter was closely watched and the fiber was move slowly to guarantee maximum photocurrent, usually around 7090 A. The 3dB bandwidth of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector was measured as 4.9 GHz under 5V biasing. The result is expressed in Fig. 4.7. For the 112 GaAs MSM photodetector array, the aggregated 3dB bandwidth was 58.8 GHz. The increase of 3dB bandwidth is due to the decrease of effective thickness of the detector, therefore increase effective voltage through the region and decrease the transit time of electron hole pairs.                         99   4.9GHz Fig. 4.7 4.9 GHz 3dB bandwidth of epitaxial liftoff GaAs MSM photodetecter 100 Chapter 5  Integration of board level optical interconnection system  5.1  Introduction        The speed and complexity of integrated circuits have increased rapidly in recent years, and this trend continues. With the increase of components per chip, chips per board, the clock speed and the degree of integration, electrical interconnects, which rely primarily on metallic aluminumcopper or polysilicon lines, are approaching fundamental limitations such as speed, packaging density, fanouts, and power dissipation.76,77 The CPU speed has been increased faster than previous predicted. In 1997, The Semiconductor Industry Association SIA issued the road map for CMOS technology and predicted that by the year 2009 more than 5000 IOs pads on the chip will be required and offchip chiptoboard clock rate will reach 23 GHz.78. The uptodate commercial CPU speed has already exceeded 3GHz and the design of a 10 GHz CPU is underway. Conventional electrical interconnects are unable to offer these high speed connection and wideband performance due to poor isolation at frequencies greater than a few gigahertz.79,80 Furthermore, it is extremely difficult for a multiprocessor computing system, which involves a large number of fanouts and long interconnection lengths 15cm, to obtain synchronous highspeed 500MHz clock distribution using electrical 101 interconnections.81 Recently, emphasis has been given to employing optical technology for improving connection of devices on a signal chip as well as between chips on a multichipmodule.82,83  Just as fiber optics offers advantages in longhaul communication systems, optical interconnection promises benefits for the future in computer system communication. Its potential advantages include large bandwidth, no capacitive loading, immunity from electromagnetic interference EMI and inherent parallelism. Therefore, it can facilitate communication within computers by means of its high speed, high capacity and high componentpackaging density.84,85 In contrast to electrical interconnections, the optical interconnection transmits information at higher data rate, consumes less power. For circuits requiring complex interconnections, it occupies less real estate on the board. Because of the dominance of the silicon CMOS technology, however, the optical interconnect system under investigation should have the possibility to integrate with todays silicon technology.86,87. There are several research directions in optical interconnect. One trend of research is the implementing freespace optical interconnect system. 88,89  Although it supports high speed connection between the CPU and memory, the main concern of this system is the reliability issue. Because the beam of light in the system is routed to some distance away, the system has to be rigid and stable at all times in order to keep the beam stay aligned. If small uncertainty occurs, it is easy for the optical system to go out of alignments. For example, when the system is moved to another location, due to the vibrations from the process of relocation, the alignment of the system 102 might be disturbed. Another research trend is fully embedded guided wave boardlevel optical interconnect system. Compared to the freespace optical interconnect, the system in fully embedded approach has the ability to withstand different disturbances from outside world. A design diagram of the fully embedded guidedwave boardlevel optical interconnection is presented in Fig.5 1. The three main components of the system are the thin film GaAS MSM photodetector array, the thin film vertical cavity surface emitting laser VCSEL array and the multimode polymer waveguide array.          via WG mirrorDetector arrayPWB layers WG layer VCSEL array   Fig. 5 2  System architecture of fully embedded guidedwave boardlevel optical interconnection.  103 In the system of fully embedded guidedwave boardlevel optical interconnect, all components are buried inside printed circuit board PCB.  The pulsed laser lights emitting from the VCSEL array are first coupled into the multimode waveguide array through 45o TIR micromirror couplers. They propagate through the channels of waveguide array.  At the other end of the waveguide array, they are reflected again by 45o TIR micromirror couplers. Finally they illuminate vertically on the active areas of the photodetector array.  The driving circuits of the VCSEL array and the amplifying circuits of the photodetector array are located on the surface of the PCB. These circuits connect the VCSEL array and photodetector array through electrical vias. In this arrangement, the buried optoelectronic components provide the performance improvement without occupying the surface of PCB.   5.2 Integration of GaAs MSM photodetector array and polymer waveguide array with 450 TIR micromirror couplers The feasibility of fully embedded guided wave boardlevel optical interconnect system was first demonstrated through integrating 1x12 GaAs MSM photodector array and the polymer waveguide array with 450 TIR micromirror coupler. Fig.5.2 illustrates the schematic of the integration. The two components of this integration are the 1x12 GaAs MSM photodetector array and the polymer waveguide array with 45o TIR micromirror couplers. The centertocenter distance 104 between adjacent detectors of 1x12 photodetector array is 250 m. This distance maches the   channel spacing of waveguide array. Each detector in the array has an active area of 50x50m.  The 45o TIR micromirror coupler was selected as the surfacenormal coupler because of its palnar nature and insensibility to the wavelength change in case of wavelength shifting of laser. Compared with other conventional ways of coupling laser beam surfacenormally into waveguide, coupling through 45o TIR micromirror coupler has certain advantages. One conventional way to attain surface normal coupling is prismlense coupling. Though it is a convenient way to change the direction of light beam in most optical system, its bulkiness prevents it from being used in fully embedded optical interconnect system. Another reason to reject prismlense coupling in the system is the issue of later planarization of the   105   Photodetector    substrate Multimode  waveguide 9020D 9120D 450 microcoupler Fig. 5.2 Schematic integration of GaAs MSM photodetector and waveguide with micro coupler  system. Because of the inherited feature of prisms and lenses, there is no foreseeable future to implement prismlens coupling in fully embedded optical interconnect system. Another method to couple laser beam surfacenormally into waveguide is grating coupling. Grating coupling needs precise control of grating parameters. It normally has small tolerance to the shifting wavelength of laser. For the abovementioned reasons, TIR micromirror coupler was selected as the surfacenomal coupler. There are three steps to integrate the 112 GaAs MSM photodetector array and the 112 polymer waveguide array with 450 micromirror couplers. First the photodetector array was fabricated. Then the polymer waveguide was formed and aligned on the top of the photodetector array. The final step was to open windows on 106 the location of the photedetector array and form TIR micromirror couplers by RIE. The fabrication process of the GaAs MSM photodector array is already described in chapter 3. To fabricate the 112 polymer waveguide array and 450 micromirror coupler, polymer Ultradel 9020D and Ultradel 9120D were used as materials for buffer and core layer of the waveguide. These polymers are negatively photosensitive therefore they can be patterned by conventional photolithography method. At 850nm wavelength the refractive indexes of Ultradel 9020D and Ultradel 9120D are 1.54 and 1.56, respectively. The GaAs wafer with fabrocated photodetector array was first cleaned and then spin coated with a thin layer of A600, the adhesion promoter that helps the 9020D layer to stick better on the surface of GaAs. Then the bottom cladding layer 9020D was spin coated on the wafer and the thickness of 9020D was between 67 m. 900C 2minute soft back process was followed to remove residue solvent. After forming the cladding layer, 67 m thick 9120D polymer was spin coated on the top of the 9020D polymer. Then the sample went through photolithographic process to form 112 array of channel waveguide with dimension of 50 m in width, 1213 m in thickness and 250 m separation spacing between adjacent channel waveguides. During the fabrication of channel waveguides, the active area of the MSM GaAs photodetector array was precisely aligned under the channel waveguide array. RIE technique was utilized to form the 450 TIR micromirror couplers. First, a layer of 3000 thick aluminum was deposited on the surface of the polymer by the electronbeam evaporator.  Through photolithographic process 107 and wet etching, an array of 50m  50m square window was opened on the aluminum layer at the top of the active area of GaAs MSM photodetector. During RIE process the sample was placed at a 450 angle with respect to the bottom surface of the chamber. As a result, an array of slanted surface with 450angle was formed as TIR micromirror couplers. Figure 5.3 shows the channel waveguide with 450 TIR micromirror couplers. Figure 5.4 shows the integration between the GaAs MSM photodetector array and polymer channel waveguide array with micromirror couplers.    Fig. 5.3 Polymer channel waveguide array with 45o TIR micromirror coupler 108    Fig5.4 GaAs MSM photodetector array integrated with polymer channel waveguide array and 45o TIR micromirror couplers  5.3 Measurement of integrated GaAs MSM photedetector array and polymer  channel waveguide array with 45o TIR micromirror couplers When the MSM GaAs photodetector array was integrated with the polymer channel waveguide array and micromirror couplers, it underwent 2000C temperature for 30 minutes while the RIE procedure was being performed. The first concern with MSM GaAs photodetector was the characteristic of Schottkey barrier of the detector. 109 Certain duration of high temperature process acts as annealing process and it might detrimentally affect Shottkey barrier. IV characteristic of the system was first measured though IV curve tracer. IV characteristic shows clearly the rectify characteristics and the breakdown voltage of the detector remained same as 15 volts. The measurement of IV characteristic implies that Shottkey barrier exists and high temperature process dose not affect rectify nature of the detector. After the confirmation of unchanged Schottkey barrier and breakdown voltage, the 3dB bandwidth the photodetector was tested. The experiment set up was very similar to the setup of measuring individual MSM photdetector, except the pulsed laser beam was coupled into one end of channel waveguide instead of on the top surface of the GaAs MSM photodetector. One experiment detail need to be pointed out was the use of ampere meter in the test setup to confirm the effective coupling of pulse laser beam into the channel waveguide and the GaAs MSM photodetector. The 3dB bandwidth of a single GaAs MSM photodetector was 2.6 GHz, remain same as that of the photodetector before the integration. The aggregated 3dB bandwidth of 12channel waveguide was 32 GHz. The unchanged 3dB bandwidth indicates that 30 minutes, 2000C RIE in the process of the integration does not detrimentally affect the performance of the detector. 110   Fig. 5.5 Cross talk measurement of channel array waveguide  111 Before the integration of channel waveguide and the array MSM photodetector, the cross talk between adjacent channels was measure. The definition of cross talk is the electrical and magnetic field in one waveguide channel manifests itself in an adjacent waveguide channel. The phenomenon that causes cross talk is electromagnetic interference. The cross talk measurement setup is shown on figure 5.5. The 633 nm HeNe laser light was coupled into one channel of waveguide array and the light signal was measured through an adjacent channel. The cross talk was measured to be 32dB. This shows that optical channel waveguide has extremely small electromagnetic interference among adjacent channels.  5.4 The integration of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector, channel waveguide with micromirror coupler and thin film VCSEL The complete fully embedded optical interconnect system is composed of integration of the thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array, the thin film VCSEL array and the channel waveguide array with TIR micromirror coupler. In order to be consistent with the thin film photodetector and the thin film VCSEL, a flexible thin film waveguide was fabricated. Soft molding technique was used to fabricate the flexible thin film waveguide array with end 450 mirror. The commercial available Topas film was used as the mechanical support of the channel waveguide array. The core material of channel waveguide is SU8, which is a negative, epoxytype, nearUV photoresist based on EPON SU8 epoxy resin. The value of refractive index of SU8 is 1.8. The fist step of fabricating thin film waveguide was to spin coat SU8 on Topas 112 thin film. Then the mode with end 450slant surface was pressed on the SU8 and Topas film. They went into 2 hours baking in the oven. Upon finishing baking, the Topas film could be simply peeled off from the mode and the flexible channel waveguide was preserved. Soft molding procedure is a fast convenient method to fabricating channel waveguide. Figure 5.6 shows a mirror end of the soft molding waveguide.                                                                                 Mirror surface Fig. 5.6 450 mirror surface of soft molding waveguide   The VCSEL was designed to be emitting 850 nm laser and has a modulation speed 2.5 GHz. The epitaxial structure of the VCSEL array was grown on a GaAs 113 substrate. An etch stop layer of 100 nm thick Al0.98Ga0.02As was grown and then a GaAs buffer layer, which includes 40.5 pairs of nDBR Distributed Brag Reflector,            10m        Effective aperture 12 m  Fig.5.7. 10 m thick thin film VCSEL array 114 three GaAs quantum wells, and 23 pairs of pDBR were grown. The total thickness of the epitaxial structure is 10 m. VCSEL array was first mechanically polished down to 250 m, and then it was back etched down to 10 m thick. Figure 5.6 shows a 10 m thick VCSEL array and its detail structure. Because in the fully embedded optical interconnect system, VCSEL takes the role as emitter and the output power of thin film VCSEL is 2 mW, proper heat sink structure has to be provided to VCSEL. The thermal behavior of VCSEL is described in thermal diffusion equation.  pp CqTCktT12  where T is temperature,  is the material density of GaAs, is the specific heat and k is the thermal conductivity.

The proposed structure is shown in figure 5.7. The structure requires that a 30 m layer Cu be deposited on the back of the VCSEL and the heat sink is connected to the out side through 250 m Cu vias. The simulated temperature in the active area of VCSEL is 320C.7,8 The preliminary integration of the fully embedded optical interconnect system was fabricated in the lab. The thin film 112 850 nm array VCSEL and the thin film 112 array GaAs MSM photodetector were used as transmitter and receiver of the system. An array of flexible channel waveguide with 450 micromirror coupler was used as transmitting media. The VCSEL array and the GaAs MSM photodetector array were first fabricated. The thin film VCSEL array and thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array were produced by epitaxially lift off. The flexible channel waveguide array with 450 micromirror coupler was fabricated by soft molding method. The integration was performed on KarlSuess mask aligner. The flexible waveguide was first bonded on a piece of clear glass mask using molten black wax. The photodetector array and VDSEL array were placed on the sample holder on the mask aligner. Very small amount of UV glue was applied on the top surface of the photodetector array and the VCSEL array. The VCSEL array was aligned with the flexible waveguide first and after UV expose the VCSEL array was fixed on the 116 surface of waveguide. Same aligning procedure was performed on the GaAs photdetector array. The finished system integration is shown on figure 5.8.

The finished system includes three main components the thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array, the thin film 850 nm VCSEL array and the polymer channel waveguide array with 450 total internal reflection micromirror 117 couplers. As one of the components of integrated system, the MSM photodetector array is investigated in details. Other issues investigated are different integration methods.  There are several types of photodetectors exist. The motivation to utilize the MSM type photodetector as the receiver of integrated system is its easiness to fabricat and epitaxial lift off. The photodetctor array in semiinsulating GaAs wafer was investigated at first. The DC and temporal characteristics were studied. The 3dB bandwidth of single GaAs MSM photodetector was measured as 2.6 GHz. As a result, the total aggregated bandwidth of the 1x12 photodetector array is 32 GHz. This result is five times faster than the speed of todays fastest system BUS.  In order to achieve the fully embedded optical interconnect system the optical receiver, in this case MSM photodetector array, has to be in the form of thin film type. To obtain the thin film MSM GaAs photodetector array, the expitaxial liftoff procedure was investigated in this research work. The thin film GaAs MSM photodetector was successfully fabricated. The thickness of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array was 1mm. The DC and temporal responses of thin film GaAs MSM photodetector array were measured. The 3dB bandwidth of the thin film detector was 4.6 GHz. The 3dB bandwidth was almost two times better than that of detector made directly on the semiinsulating GaAs wafer. It is the much thinner vertical distance of active GaAs wafer causes the 3dB bandwidth improvement.   118  The first step of integrating the system was accomplished. The integrated system includes an MSM photodetector array and an array of polymer channel waveguides with TIR micromirror couplers. The success of the integration was confirmed by measuring photocurrent from the photodetector when the laser light was launched into one end of polymer waveguide. The measured 3dB bandwidth of the systems single channel was 2.6 GHz. The total system integration was also attempted. Three components, the thin film GaAs MSM photodetector, the thin film 850 nm VCSEL and the flexible polymer channel waveguide with 450 TIR micromirror coupler have been physically integrated. Integration confirmation of the system is being underway. Future works may include sending modulated signal from VCSEL, and measure the DC, temporal response of the photodetector. The expected 3dB bandwidth of this fully embedded boardlevel optical interconnection is an order higher when compared with the BUS bandwidth of state of art computer. Also the fully embedded architecture will dramatically increase in BUS speed that constrained by all electrical interconnect system and has no interference of todays PCB fabrication process.                       119 References  1.
