The WiMAX signal is broadcasted from a base station to the widegeographically spread receivers. WiMAX enabled mobile devices become very popular due to the fact the network connections can be easily maintained on move. Regarding the network security, WiMAX provides strong user authentication, access control, data privacy and data integrity using sophisticated encryption technology. WiMAX technology is the only solution for isolated locations where elearning distributed platforms need to be used. This paper focuses on security issues for elearning solutions, especially when WiMAX technology is used.  Keywords WiMAX, security, elearning solutions, mobile networks, cloud computing.  1. Introduction  Elearning is widely used today on different educational levels continuous education, company trainings, academic courses, etc. The educational process is a complex service which involves a producer and a consumer. There are various elearning solutions from open source to commercial. There are at least two entities involved in an elearning system the students and the trainers. The students actions within an elearning platform are  Taking online course  Taking exams  Sending feedback  Sending homework, projects The trainers involved in elearning solutions are  Dealing with content management  Preparing tests  Assessing tests, homework, projects taken by students  Sending feedback  Communicating with students forums Each of these actions requires a certain degree of security, depending on the importance and data sensitivity. The elearning solution can be implemented in inaccessible locations isolated localities and communities using several mobile technologies GSMUMTS, WiMAX etc. One of the promising technologies is WiMAX. It provides high speed data transfer and can be used in such locations, where other communications technologies are not available. The typical WiMAX applications are related to broadband data connections including rural areas or geographically isolated locations, Voice over IP VoIP, Metrozones and digital television.  2. The WiMAX Technology  WiMAX stands for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access, a telecommunication technology based on WirelessMAN standard 802.16 1. WiMAX provides wireless data transmission using different transmission modes, from pointtopoint to complete cell access.  The standard was created in 2001 by the collaboration of Intel and Alvarion companies and ratified by the IEEE under the name IEEE802.16. The WiMAX name and logo figure 1 were created by WiMAX Forum, a nonprofit organization established to promote the adoption of WiMAX compatible products, This is a post conference paper. Parts of this paper have been published in the Proceedings of the SECITC 2009 Conference printed version.    Journal of Mobile, Embedded and Distributed Systems, vol. II, no. 1, 2010 ISSN 2067  4074    16    services and to ensure a high level of interoperability among them.   Fig. 1 The WiMAX logo  The fixed WiMAX 802.162004 or 802.16d, fixed line connection with a roof mounted antenna has no support for mobility and it was used to develop the mobile WiMAX standard, known as 802.162005 or 802.16e.  Figure 2 depicts the components of a WiMAX network.    Fig. 2 WiMAX Network  A minimal WiMAX system consists of the following two components 2  WiMAX base station  the place where the WiMAX signals are broadcasted from. It is connected to the public network using fiber optics, radio links or other highspeed pointtopoint. Regularly the WiMAX towers that works exactly like GSM network phones towers are playing the role of the base station together with some electronic devices. These towers can cover up to 50 kilometers radius but due the geographic limitations the distance is just about 10 kilometers. Any wireless device that is WiMAX compliant can connect to the network if fallen into the base station range  receivers  devices used to receive the signals from WiMAX base station. The receivers are allowing the mobile devices to connect to the WiMAX network. The mechanism is very similar to the WiFi access, the only difference is the longer distance covered by WiMAX figure 3. Typically, one base station can connect to several other base stations by microwave links at high speed. This connection is called backhaul and it allows the existence of WiMAX roaming by maintaining connections on move.  www.jmeds.eu     17      Fig. 3 WiMAX vs. WiFi  The WiMAX provides highspeed Internet access on a radius around 50 kilometers. The technology doesnt require the receivers to be in a direct line of sight LOS with the base station. This is usually called NLOS Non Line Of Sight. Except the small barriers like houses, trees, the WiMAX is not capable to bypass hills or large buildings without a significant decrease in the speed.   WiMAX provides highspeed connections without the need for cables, so it is a good alternative to classical cable or DSL access. Also, WiMAX is suitable to for the so called last mile areas that are not covered by normal wired technologies. WiMAX allows the existence of Metro Zones having portable outdoor wireless access.  Another interesting possibility of using WiMAX is to connect two local wireless networks into a mesh, something very similar with the GSM roaming. The QoS Quality of Service represents the network capability to guarantee that a service works when it is used. As is all other wireless and even wired networks, the bandwidth is divided among the users, so the WiMAX performance can drop significantly when the number of users is increasing.  To avoid such a situation, WiMAX reserves bandwidth for given purposes, like Voice over IP, where the communication delays can lead to useless connections.  3. WiMAX Security  In order to be able to win the competition with classical cable or DSL providers, the WiMAX network should be at least as secure.  The WiMAX security is based on two quality encryption standards, the DES3 and AES that allows a high support for confidentiality 3. Also, the standard requires a dedicated security processor located at the base station level.  The entire WiMAX network traffic must be encrypted using CCMP Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol that uses AES to provide encryption for secure data transmission. Each subscriber station must use X.509 certificate that is uniquely identifying the subscriber, so it is not possible for attackers to get another subscriber identity. An X.509 certificate consists of the following fields   version  Journal of Mobile, Embedded and Distributed Systems, vol. II, no. 1, 2010 ISSN 2067  4074    18     serial number   signature algorithm ID   issuer name   validity period   subject user name   subject public key information   issuer unique identifier   subject unique identifier   extensions   signature algorithm  signature value  There are specific encryption requirements for the endtoend authentication that is provided for using PKMEAP Extensible Authentication Protocol based on the TLS standard of public key encryption. Because the WiMAX network is based on the Internet Protocol, it has the same vulnerabilities as any IP network, like DoS Denial of Service, IP spoofing, session hijacking and so on. Other types of potential attacks for a WiMAX network are ManintheMiddle and network manipulation with spoofed management frames management frames are not encrypted. WiMAX users should feel safe because only authorized users are able to access WiMAX services and the transmitted data is manipulation free. The physical layer is unsecured, so the WiMAX is vulnerable to classical attacks at physical level such as  scrambling  affects the order of specific frames, an attacker can force the users to retransmit the data, so the channel becomes very busy, affecting the overall network performance  the impact can be considered as being low since it is enough to retransmit the data in order to recover the network status  jamming  presence of a source of noise, malicious or accidental, that drastically reduces the capacity of the communication channel fortunately, the jamming can be easily detected and located by using radio scanning devices, but the risks can be considered as major. A Denial of Service attack DoS is very likely to occur in a WiMAX network because the authentication operations users or devices need long procedures to be executed, so an attacker can easily flood an user by sending him numerous messages to authenticate. A potential scenario could be the flooding of a station in order to drain its battery.    4. Using WiMAX Technology for elearning solutions  Usually, elearning systems are developed as distributed applications, but this is not necessary so. The architecture of a distributed elearning system includes software components, like the client application, an application server and a database server the necessary hardware components client computer, communication infrastructure and servers.  Elearning clients have to be developed having in mind users requirements, several studies in this area being made for mobile clients in 7, 9. Figure 4 presents an architecture of an elearning solutions based on WinMAX technology.  www.jmeds.eu     19      Fig. 4 An elearning solution using WiMAX  The elearning clients connect to the elearning platform by using WiFi networks or connecting directly to the WiMAX network if appropriate hardware is available. The elearning solution can be integrated into cloud architecture 4. A very big concern is related to the data security because both the software and the data are located on remote servers that can crash or disappear without any additional warnings 8. Even if it seems not very reasonable, the cloud computing provides some major security benefits for individuals and companies that are usingdeveloping elearning solutions, like the following  improved improbability  it is almost impossible for any interested person thief  to determine where is located the machine that stores some wanted data tests, exam questions, results or to find out  which is the physical component he needs to steal in order to get a digital asset  virtualization  makes possible the rapid replacement of a compromised cloud located server without major costs or damages. It is very easy to create a clone of a virtual machine so the cloud downtime is expected to be reduced substantially  centralized data storage  losing a cloud client is no longer a major incident while the main part of the applications and data is stored into the cloud so a new client can be connected very fast. Imagine what is happening today if a laptop that stores the examination questions is stolen  monitoring of data access becomes easier in view of the fact that only one place should be supervised, not thousands of computers belonging to a university, for example. Also, the security changes can be easily tested and implemented since the cloud represents a unique entry point for all the clients.

For example, if WiFi is used, it is recommended to use WPA2 standard combined with other WiFi security techniques.  5. Conclusions  WiMAX is an appropriate solution for elearning platforms when the trainee location is isolated. One of the main concerns is related to security. Currently there are no efficient solutions to prevent the attacks at the physical layer of a WiMAX network but, despite of all issues and threats, WiMAX is considered to be a secure network that provides  strong user authentication  access control  data privacy   data integrity  using sophisticated authentication and encryption technology.  WiMAX technology will be used in Romania on a large scale in the near future. This will help the elearning solutions and that will lead to a better education system in Romania.
