The program in computer science (CS) provides a blend of the foundations of CS and applications in the information technology (IT) industry. The CS program emphasizes the study of computer systems architecture, software development, and data communications. Core technology areas include programming, computer architecture, operating systems, data communication, database systems, and software engineering. These areas are supported by a strong foundation in computing principles such as the design of programming languages, data structures, and operating system principles. The program includes a mathematics component and mathematics concepts are incorporated into many of the major courses. A certificate in Mathematical Foundations of Computing is also available. CS majors are strongly advised to take advantage of this new option for credentialing their academic accomplishments. Graduates of the CS program are prepared for a variety of careers in CS and IT, especially in the development of software for distributed systems. Example job titles from KSU graduates of the CS program include information technology specialist, programmer analyst, software engineer, network administrator, and software consultant. This program also prepares students for graduate studies in IT-related fields.
