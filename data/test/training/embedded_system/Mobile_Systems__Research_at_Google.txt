Google is committed to realizing the potential of the mobile web to transform how people interact with computing technology. Google engineers and researchers work on a wide range of problems in mobile computing and networking, including new operating systems and programming platforms (such as Android and ChromeOS); new interaction paradigms between people and devices; advanced wireless communications; and optimizing the web for mobile settings. In addition, many of Googleâ€™s core product teams, such as Search, Gmail, and Maps, have groups focused on optimizing the mobile experience, making it faster and more seamless. We take a cross-layer approach to research in mobile systems and networking, cutting across applications, networks, operating systems, and hardware. The tremendous scale of Googleâ€™s products and the Android and Chrome platforms make this a very exciting place to work on these problems. Some representative projects include mobile web performance optimization, new features in Android to greatly reduce network data usage and energy consumption; new platforms for developing high performance web applications on mobile devices; wireless communication protocols that will yield vastly greater performance over todayâ€™s standards; and multi-device interaction based on Android, which is now available on a wide variety of consumer electronics. 62 Publications     EYEORG: A Platform For Crowdsourcing Web Quality Of Experience Measurements Dina Papagiannaki ACM CoNEXT 2016 (2016) (to appear)       Understanding the Challenges of Designing and Developing Multi-Device Experiences Tao Dong , Elizabeth F.
