Multimedia Watermarking TechniquesFRANK HARTUNG, STUDENT MEMBER, IEEE, AND MARTIN KUTTERInvited PaperMultimedia watermarking technology has evolved very quicklyduring the last few years. A digital watermark is informationthat is imperceptibly and robustly embedded in the host datasuch that it cannot be removed. A watermark typically containsinformation about the origin, status, or recipient of the hostdata. In this tutorial paper, the requirements and applicationsfor watermarking are reviewed. Applications include copyrightprotection, data monitoring, and data tracking. The basic conceptsof watermarking systems are outlined and illustrated with proposedwatermarking methods for images, video, audio, text documents,and other media. Robustness and security aspects are discussed indetail. Finally, a few remarks are made about the state of the artand possible future developments in watermarking technology.Keywords Audio, image, multimedia, review, video, watermarking.I. INTRODUCTIONMultimedia production and distribution, as we see ittoday, is all digital, from the authoring tools of content providers to the receivers. The advantages of digitalprocessing and distribution, like noisefree transmission,software instead of hardware processing, and improvedreconfigurability of systems, are all well known and obvious. Not so obvious are the disadvantages of digitalmedia distribution. For example, from the viewpoint ofmedia producers and content providers, the possibility forunlimited copying of digital data without loss of fidelityis undesirable because it may cause considerable financialloss. Digital copy protection or copy prevention mechanisms are only of limited value because access to cleartextversions of protected data must at least be granted topaying recipients which can then produce and distributeillegal copies. Technical attempts to prevent copying havein reality always been circumvented.One remaining method for the protection of intellectualproperty rights IPR is the embedding of digital watermarks into multimedia data. The watermark is a digital codeManuscript received October 20, 1997 revised March 26, 1998.F.

Although not directlyused for copy protection, it can at least help identifyingsource and destination of multimedia data and, as a lastline of defense, enable appropriate followup actions incase of suspected copyright violations.While copyright protection is the most prominent application of watermarking techniques, others exist, includingdata authentication by means of fragile watermarks whichare impaired or destroyed by manipulations, embeddedtransmission of value added services within multimediadata, and embedded data labeling for other purposes thancopyright protection, such as data monitoring and tracking.An example for a datamonitoring system is the automaticregistration and monitoring of broadcasted radio programssuch that royalties are automatically paid to the IPR ownersof the broadcast data.The development of watermarking methods involvesseveral design tradeoffs. Watermarks should be robustagainst standard data manipulations, including digitaltoanalog conversion and digital format conversion. Securityis a special concern, and watermarks should resist evenattempted attacks by knowledgeable individuals. On theother hand, watermarks should be imperceptible and conveyas much information as possible. In general, watermarkembedding and retrieval should have low complexitybecause for various applications, realtime watermarking isdesirable. All of these partly contradicting requirementsand the resulting design constraints will be discussed inmore detail throughout the paper.The paper is organized as follows. Section II gives anintroductory explanation of the terms used, as well as afew remarks about the historical aspects of watermarking.In Section III, common design requirements and principlesare explained that apply to all watermarking techniques, independent of the actual application. Sections IVVII reviewvarious watermarking techniques that have been proposedfor formatted text data, images, video, and audio, respectively. Watermarking of other media, including threedimensional 3D data and 3D animation parameters, isdiscussed in Section VIII. Section IX gives detailed insight001892199910.00  1999 IEEEPROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999 1079into security issues, namely attacks against watermarks, andshows the relations between watermarking and cryptology.In Section X, we extrapolate the recent development ofwatermarking technology and watermarking applicationsand try to forecast future trends. Section XI summarizesand concludes this paper on multimedia watermarkingtechniques.II. STEGANOGRAPHY AND WATERMARKINGHISTORYAND TERMINOLOGYA. HistoryThe idea to communicate secretly is as old as communication itself. First stories, which can be interpreted as earlyrecords of covert communication, appear in the old Greekliterature, for example, in Homers Iliad, or in tales byHerodotus. The word steganography, which is still in usetoday, derives from the Greek language and means covertcommunication. Kobayashi 67 and Petitcolas et al. 99have investigated the history of covert communication ingreat detail, including the broad use of techniques for secretand covert communication before and during the two WorldWars, and steganographic methods for analog signals. Although the historical background is very interesting, we donot cover it here in detail. Please refer to 67 and 99 foran indepth investigation of historic aspects.Paper watermarks appeared in the art of handmade papermaking nearly 700 years ago. The oldest watermarkedpaper found in archives dates back to 1292 and has itsorigin in Fabriano, Italy, which is considered the birthplaceof watermarks. At the end of the thirteenth century, about 40paper mills were sharing the paper marked in Fabriano andproducing paper with different format, quality, and price.They produced raw, coarse paper which was smoothedand postprocessed by artisans and sold by merchants.Competition not only among the paper mills but also amongthe artisans and merchants was very high, and it wasdifficult to keep track of paper provenance and thus formatand quality identification. The introduction of watermarkshelped avoiding any possibility of confusion. After theirinvention, watermarks quickly spread over Italy and thenover Europe, and although originally used to indicate thepaper brand or paper mill, they later served as indication forpaper format, quality, and strength and were also used todate and authenticate paper. A nice example illustrating thelegal power of watermarks is a case in 1887 in France calledDes Decorations 41. The watermarks of two letters,presented as pieces of evidence, proved that the lettershad been predated and resulted in considerable sensationand, in the end, in the resignation of President Grevy. Formore information on paper watermarks, watermark history,and related legal issues, please refer to 144, an extensivelisting of over 500 references.The analogy between paper watermarks, steganography,and digital watermarking is obvious, and in fact, paperwatermarks in money bills or stamps 135 actually inspiredthe first use of the term watermarking in the context ofdigital data.The idea of digital image watermarking arose independently in 1990 131, 132 and around 1993 20, 136.Tirkel et al. 136 coined the word water mark whichbecame watermark later on. It took a few more yearsuntil 19951996 before watermarking received remarkableattention. Since then, digital watermarking has gained alot of attention and has evolved very quickly, and whilethere are a lot of topics open for further research, practicalworking methods and systems have been developed. In thispaper, we introduce the concepts and illustrate them withsome of the work that has been published. While attemptingto be as complete as possible, we can still only give a roughoverview.B. TerminologyToday, we are of course concerned with digital communication. As in classical analog communication, also in digitalcommunication there is interest for methods that allow thetransmission of information hidden or embedded in otherdata. While such techniques often share similar principlesand basic ideas, there are also important distinguishing features, mainly in terms of robustness against attacks. Severalnames have been coined for such techniques. However, theterms are often confused, and therefore it is necessary toclarify the differences.Steganography stands for techniques in general that allowsecret communication, usually by embedding or hidingthe secret information in other, unsuspected data. Steganographic methods generally do rely on the assumption thatthe existence of the covert communication is unknownto third parties and are mainly used in secret pointtopoint communication between trusting parties. As a result,steganographic methods are in general not robust, i.e.,the hidden information cannot be recovered after datamanipulation.Watermarking, as opposed to steganography, has theadditional notion of robustness against attacks. Even ifthe existence of the hidden information is known it isdifficultideally impossiblefor an attacker to destroy theembedded watermark, even if the algorithmic principle ofthe watermarking method is public. In cryptography, this isknown as Kerkhoffs law a cryptosystem should be secure,even if an attacker knows the cryptographic principles andmethods used but does not have the appropriate key 117.A practical implication of the robustness requirement isthat watermarking methods can typically embed much lessinformation into host data than steganographic methods.Steganography and watermarking are thus more complementary than competitive approaches. In the remainder ofthis paper, we focus on watermarking methods and noton steganographic methods in general. For an overview ofsteganographic methods the reader is referred to 67, 99,and 124.Data hiding and data embedding are used in varyingcontexts, but they do typically denote either steganographyor applications between steganography and watermarking, which means applications where the existence of theembedded data are publicly known, but there is no need1080 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999to protect it. This is typically the case for the embeddedtransmission of auxiliary information or services 125that are publicly available and do not relate to copyrightprotection or conditional access functionalities.Fingerprinting and labeling are terms that denote specialapplications of watermarking. They relate to copyrightprotection applications where information about originatorand recipient of digital data is embedded as watermarks.The individual watermarks, which are unique codes out ofa series of codes, are called fingerprints or labels.Bitstream watermarking is sometimes used for datahiding or watermarking of compressed data, for example,compressed video.The term embedded signatures has been used instead ofwatermarking in early publications. Because it potentiallyleads to confusion with cryptographic digital signatures117, it is usually not used anymore. Cryptographic signatures serve for authentication purposes. They are used todetect alterations of the signed data and to authenticate thesender. Watermarks, however, are only in special applications used for authentication and are usually designed toresist alterations and modifications.Visible watermarks, as the name says, are visual patterns,like logos, which are inserted into or overlaid on images orvideo, very similar to visible paper watermarks. However,the name is confusing since visible watermarks are notwatermarks in the sense of this paper. Visible watermarksare mainly applied to images, for example, to visibly markpreview images available in image databases or on theWorld Wide Web in order to prevent people from commercial use of such images. A visible watermarking methoddevised by Braudaway et al. 16 combines the watermarkimage with the original image by modifying the brightnessof the original image as a function of the watermark anda secret key. The secret key determines pseudorandomscaling values used for the brightness modification in orderto make it difficult for attackers to remove the visible mark.III. DIGITAL WATERMARKINGA. RequirementsThe basic requirements in watermarking apply to allmedia and are very intuitive.1 A watermark shall convey as much information aspossible, which means the watermark data rate shouldbe high.2 A watermark should in general be secret and shouldonly be accessible by authorized parties. This requirement is referred to as security of the watermark andis usually achieved by the use of cryptographic keys.3 A watermark should stay in the host data regardlessof whatever happens to the host data, including allpossible signal processing that may occur, and including all hostile attacks that unauthorized parties mayattempt. This requirement is referred to as robustnessof the watermark. It is a key requirement for copyright protection or conditional access applications, butless important for applications where the watermarksare not required to be cryptographically secure, forexample, for applications where watermarks conveypublic information.4 A watermark should, though being unremovable, beimperceptible.Depending on the media to be watermarked and the application, this basic set of requirements may be supplementedby additional requirements.1 Watermark recovery may or may not be allowed touse the original, unwatermarked host data.2 Depending on the application, watermark embedding may be required in real time, e.g., for videofingerprinting. Realtime embedding again may, forcomplexity reasons, require compresseddomain embedding methods.3 Depending on the application, the watermark may berequired to be able to convey arbitrary information.For other applications, only a few predefined watermarks may have to be embedded, and for the decoderit may be sufficient to check for the presence of oneof the predefined watermarks hypothesis testing.In the following, a few of the mentioned requirements andthe resulting design issues are highlighted in more detail.1 Watermark Security and Keys If security, i.e., secrecyof the embedded information, is required, one or severalsecret and cryptographically secure keys have to be usedfor the embedding and extraction process. For example,in many schemes, pseudorandom signals are embedded aswatermarks. In this case, the description and the seed of thepseudorandom number generator may be used as key. Thereare two levels of secrecy. In the first level, an unauthorizeduser can neither read or decode an embedded watermark norcan he detect if a given set of data contains a watermark.The second level permits unauthorized users to detect ifdata are watermarked, however, the embedded informationcannot be read without having the secret key. Such schemescan, for example, embed two watermarks, one with apublic key and the other with a secret key. Alternatively, ascheme has been proposed which combines one or severalpublic keys with a private key and embeds one combinedpublicprivate watermark, rather than several watermarks48. When designing an overall copyright protection system, issues like secret key generation, distribution, andmanagement possibly by trusted third parties, as well asother system integration aspects have to be considered.2 Robustness In the design of any watermarkingscheme, watermark robustness is typically one of the mainissues, since robustness against data distortions introducedthrough standard data processing and attacks is a majorrequirement. Standard data processing includes all datamanipulation and modification that the data might undergoin the usual distribution chain, such as data editing, printing,enhancement, and format conversion. Attack denotes datamanipulation with the purpose of impairing, destroying, orremoving the embedded watermarks. Section IXB belowrevisits attacks and gives remedies that help to makewatermarks attack resistent.HARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1081Although it is possible to design robust watermarkingtechniques, it should be noted that a watermark is onlyrobust as long as it is not public, which means as longas it cannot be read by everyone. If watermark detectorprinciple and key are public, and even if only a blackboxwatermark detector is public, the watermark is vulnerable toattacks 28, 64. Hence, public watermarks, as sometimesproposed in the literature, are not robust unless everyreceiver uses a different key. This however is difficult inpractice and gives rise to collusion attacks.3 Imperceptibility One of the main requirements forwatermarking is the perceptual transparency. The dataembedding process should not introduce any perceptible artifacts into the host data. On the other hand, for high robustness, it is desirable that the watermark amplitude is as highas possible. Thus, the design of a watermarking methodalways involves a tradeoff between imperceptibility androbustness. It would be optimal to embed a watermark justbelow the threshold of perception. However, this thresholdis difficult to determine for realworld image, video andaudio signals. Several measures to determine objectivelyperceived distortion and the threshold of perception havebeen proposed for the mentioned media 75. However,most of them are still not perfect enough to replace humanviewers or listeners who judge the visual or audio fidelitythrough blind tests. Thus, in the design of watermarkingsystems, it is usually necessary to do some testing withvolunteers. The second problem occurs in combination withpost watermarking processing, which might result in anamplification of the embedded watermark and make it perceptible. An example is zooming of watermarked images,which often makes the embedded watermarks visible, orcontrast enhancement, which may amplify highly frequentwatermark patterns that are otherwise invisible.4 Watermark Recovery With or Without the Original DataWatermark recovery is usually more robust if the original,unwatermarked data are available. Further, availability ofthe original data set in the recovery process allows thedetection and inversion of distortions which change the datageometry. This helps, for example, if a watermarked imagehas been rotated by an attacker. However, access to the original data is not possible in all cases, for example, in applications such as data monitoring or tracking. For other applications, like video watermarking, it may be impractical to usethe original data because of the large data volume, even if itis available. It is, however, possible to design watermarkingtechniques that do not need the original for watermark extraction. Most watermarking techniques perform some kindof modulation in which the original data set is considered adistortion. If this distortion is known or can be modeledin the recovery process, explicitly designed techniquesallow its suppression without knowledge of the original.In fact, most recent methods do not require the original forwatermark recovery. In some publications, such techniquesare called blind watermarking techniques 2, 1.5 Watermark Extraction or Verification of Presence for aGiven Watermark In the literature, two different types ofwatermarking systems can be found systems that embeda specific information or pattern and check the existenceof the known information later on in the watermark recoveryusually using some sort of hypothesis testingandsystems that embed arbitrary information into the host data.The first type, verification of the presence of a knownwatermark, is sufficient for most copyrightprotection applications.The second type, embedding of arbitrary information, is,for example, useful for image tracking on the Internet withintelligent agents where it might not only be of interest todiscover images, but also to classify them. In such cases, theembedded watermark can serve as an image identificationnumber. Another example where arbitrary information hasto be embedded are applications for video distributionwhere, e.g., the serial number of the receiver has to beembedded.Although most presented methods or systems are designed for either watermark extraction or verification ofpresence for a given watermark, it should be noted that infact both approaches are inherently equivalent. A schemethat allows watermark verification can be considered asa 1bit watermark recovery scheme, which can easily beextended to any number of bits by embedding severalconsecutive 1bit watermarks. The inverse is also truea watermark recovery scheme can be considered as awatermark verification scheme assuming the embeddedinformation is known.B. Basic Watermarking PrinciplesThe basic idea in watermarking is to add a watermarksignal to the host data to be watermarked such that thewatermark signal is unobtrusive and secure in the signalmixture but can partly or fully be recovered from the signalmixture later on if the correct cryptographically secure keyneeded for recovery is used.To ensure imperceptibility of the modification caused bywatermark embedding, a perceptibility criterion of somesort is used. This can be implicit or explicit, host dataadaptive or fixed, but it is necessary. As a consequence ofthe required imperceptibility, the individual samples e.g.,pixels or transform coefficients that are used for watermarkembedding can only be modified by an amount relativelysmall to their average amplitude.To ensure robustness despite the small allowed changes,the watermark information is usually redundantly distributed over many samples e.g., pixels of the host data,thus providing a holographic robustness, which meansthat the watermark can usually be recovered from a smallfraction of the watermarked data, but the recovery is morerobust if more of the watermarked data are available forrecovery.As said before, watermark systems do in general use oneor more cryptographically secure keys to ensure securityagainst manipulation and erasure of the watermark.There are three main issues in the design of a watermarking system.1082 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999Fig. 1. Generic digital watermarking scheme.Fig. 2. Generic watermark recovery scheme.1 Design of the watermark signal to be added to thehost signal. Typically, the watermark signal dependson a key and watermark information1Possibly, it may also depend on the host data intowhich it is embedded22 Design of the embedding method itself that incorporates the watermark signal into the host datayielding watermarked data33 Design of the corresponding extraction method thatrecovers the watermark information from the signalmixture using the key and with help of the original4or without the original5The first two issues, watermark signal design and watermark signal embedding, are often regarded as one, specifically for methods were the embedded watermark is hostsignal adaptive.Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the concept. Fig. 1 shows thegeneric watermarking scheme for the embedding process.The input to the scheme is the watermark, the host data, andan optional public or secret key. The host data may, depending on the application, be uncompressed or compressed,however, most proposed methods work on uncompresseddata. The watermark can be of any nature, such as a number,text, or an image. The secret or public key is used to enforcesecurity. If the watermark is not to be read by unauthorizedparties, a key can be used to protect the watermark. Incombination with a secret or a public key, the watermarkingtechniques are usually referred to as secret and publicwatermarking techniques, respectively. The output of thewatermarking scheme are the modified, i.e., watermarked,data. The generic watermark recovery process is depictedin Fig. 2. Inputs to the scheme are the watermarked data,the secret or public key, and, depending on the method,the original data and the original watermark. The outputof the watermark recovery process is either the recoveredwatermark or some kind of confidence measure indicatinghow likely it is for the given watermark at the input to bepresent in the data under inspection.Many proposed watermarking schemes use ideasborrowed from spreadspectrum radio communications25, 43, 101. They embed a watermark by addinga pseudonoise PN signal with low amplitude to the hostdata. This specific PN signal can later on be detected usinga correlation receiver or matched filter. If the parameterslike amplitude and the number of samples of the added PNsignal are chosen appropriately, the probabilities of falsepositive or falsenegative detections are very low. The PNsignal has the function of a secret key. The scheme can beextended if the PN signal is either added or subtracted fromthe host signal. In this case, the correlation receiver willcalculate either a highpositive or highnegative correlationin the detection. Thus, 1 bit of information can be conveyed.If several such watermarks are embedded consecutively,arbitrary information can be conveyed.IV. TEXT DOCUMENT WATERMARKINGMethods for embedding information into text documentshave been used for a long time by secret services.For text watermarking, we have to distinguish betweenmethods that hide information in the semantics, whichmeans in the meaning and ordering of the words, andmethods that hide information in the format, which meansin the layout and the appearance.The first class designs a text around the message to behidden. In that sense, the information is not really embeddedin existing information, but rather covered by misleadinginformation. This class of techniques is outside the scope ofthis paper and will not be considered here. In the following,we concentrate on the latter type of informationembeddingmethods which use an existing text document into whichdata are embedded.Formatted text is probably the medium where watermarking methods can be defeated most easily. If the watermarkis in the format, then it can obviously be removed byretyping the whole text using a new character font anda new format where retyping can be either manual orautomated using optical character recognition OCR. OCRsystems are still not perfect for many applications todayand often need human supervision. Thus, removal of watermarks either yields bad results single characters are wrong,due to OCR or is expensive. The goal is to make watermarkremoval more expensive than obtaining the right to copyfrom the copyright owner. If this goal is achieved, textwatermarking makes sense, though it can be defeated 14.Text watermarking has applications wherever copyrightedelectronic documents are distributed. Important examplesare virtual digital libraries where users may downloadHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1083Fig. 3. Example for wordshift coding.copies of documents, for example, books, but are not allowed to further distribute them or to store them longer thanfor a certain predefined period. In this type of application,a requested document is watermarked with a requesterspecific watermark before releasing it for download. If lateron illegal copies are discovered, the embedded watermarkcan be used to determine the source.Brassil et al. 14, 15, 84, 85, 91 have extensivelyworked on text watermarking. They propose three differentmethods for information embedding into text documentsline shift coding wordshift coding and feature coding.In lineshift coding, single lines of the document areshifted upwards or downwards by very small amounts. Theinformation to be hidden is encoded in the way the lines areshifted. Similarly, words are shifted horizontally in orderto modify the spaces between consecutive words in wordshift coding. An example for wordshift coding is shown inFig. 3. Both methods are applicable to the format file of adocument or to the bitmap of a page image. While lineshiftcoding can rely on the assumption that lines are uniformlyspaced, and thus does not necessarily need the original forwatermark extraction, the original is required for extractionin wordshift coding, since the spaces between words areusually variable. The third method, feature coding, slightlymodifies features such as the length of the end lines incharacters like etc. Among the three presentedmethods, lineshift coding is the most robust in the presenceof noise but also most easily defeated. The authors againargue that although the described methods can theoreticallybe defeated, it requires interactive human intervention andis expensive in practice. The presented methods are robustenough to resist printing, consecutive photocopying up toten generations, and rescanning 85.V. IMAGE WATERMARKINGMost watermarking research and publications are focusedon images. The reason might be that there is a large demandfor image watermarking products due to the fact that thereare so many images available at no cost on the World WideWeb which need to be protected.Meanwhile, the number of image watermarking publications is too large to give a complete survey overall proposed techniques. However, most techniques sharecommon principles. Thus, we try to point out the commonideas first, before we explain some selected methods inmore detail to illustrate how the principles are applied inpractice.The watermark signal is typically a pseudorandom signalwith low amplitude, compared to the image amplitude, andusually with spatial distribution of one information i.e.,watermark bit over many pixels. A lot of watermarkingmethods are in fact very similar and differ only in parts orsingle aspects of the three topics signal design embeddingand recovery.The information that is embedded is usually not importantfor the watermarking itself. However, there are methods thatare designed to embed and extract one out of a codebook ofcodes, and thus cannot accommodate arbitrary information27, 72. Other proposed schemes modulate the codesavailable in the codebook with arbitrary information bitsand can thus accommodate arbitrary messages. Althoughsome authors distinguish strictly between the two types,they are in fact conceptually very close.The watermark signal is often designed as a white 136,139 or colored pseudorandom signal with, e.g., Gaussian27, uniform, or bipolar 33, 72, 76, 93, 136, probability density function pdf. In order to avoid visibilityof the embedded watermark, an implicit or explicit spatial7, 66, 126, 146 or spectral 66, 105, 106, 126,130, 146 shaping is often applied with the goal to attenuate the watermark in areas of the image where it wouldotherwise become visible. The resulting watermark signal issometimes sparse and leaves image pixels unchanged 33,74, but mostly it is dense and alters all pixels of the imageto be watermarked. The watermark signal is often designedin the spatial domain, but sometimes also in a transformdomain like the fullimage discrete cosine transform DCTdomain 27 or blockwise DCT domain 69.The signal embedding is done by addition 78, 93,139 or signaladaptive i.e., scaled addition 2, mostlyto the luminance channel alone, but sometimes also tocolor channels, or only to color channels 73. The additioncan take place in the spatial domain, or in transformdomains such as the discrete Fourier transform DFTdomain 113, the fullimage DCT domain 3, 27, 105,the blockwise DCT domain 7, 47, 69, 78, 106,151, the wavelet domain 71, 72, 143, the fractaldomain 34, 96, 109, the Hadamard domain 59, 111,the FourierMellin domain 114, 115, or the Radondomain 150. It is often claimed that embedding in thetransform mostly DCT or wavelet domain is advantageousin terms of visibility and security 3. However, while someauthors argue that the watermarks should be embedded intolow frequencies 27, 114, other argue that they shouldrather be embedded into the medium 3, 36, 56 or highfrequencies. In fact, it has been shown 122, 123 thatfor maximum robustness watermarks should be embeddedsignal adaptively into the same spectral components thatthe host data already populate. For images and video, theseare typically the low frequencies.As said before, watermark signal generation and watermark embedding are often treated jointly. For someproposed methods, they cannot be regarded separately,especially if the watermark is signal adaptive 3, 22,23, 78, 148.The watermark recovery is usually done by some sortof correlation method, like a correlation receiver or amatched filter. Since the watermark signal is often designedwithout knowledge of the host signal, crosstalk betweenwatermark signal and host data is a common problem in1084 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999watermarking. In order to suppress the crosstalk, manyproposed schemes require the original, unwatermarked datain order to subtract it before watermark extraction. Otherproposed methods apply a prefilter 38, 73, 82, 139instead of subtracting the original. Yet other methods do notsuppress the crosstalk 105. Some researchers propose touse more sophisticated detectors than just simple correlationdetectors, e.g., maximum aposteriori MAP detectors 3.Like for embedding, several domains have been proposedfor watermark extraction, often corresponding to the domain that is proposed for embedding or for signal design.There are fewer publications where watermark embeddingand extraction are proposed in different domains.Before we look at some specific watermarking techniquesin the different domains, we give a brief chronologicaloverview of early watermarking methods.The year 1993 can be considered the beginning of thedigital image watermarking era, although other publicationsfrom the early 1990s, such as Tanaka et al. 131, 132,already introduced the idea of tagging images to secretlyhide information and assure ownership rights. Caronni 20,21 describes an overall system to track unauthorizedimage distribution. He proposes to mark images usingspatial signal modulation and calls the process tagging.A tag is a square of size In a first step, allpossible locations in an image where a tag could possiblybe placed are identified by calculating the local regionvariance of size in the image and comparingit to empirically identified upper and lower limits. Onlylocations with minimal variance are used for tagging. Atag is a square with a constant value proportional to themaximum image brightness within the square and decayingoutside the border. A selected image area is tagged byadding or subtracting the tag and a random, zero mean,noise pattern. Both the tag location and the noise sequenceare key dependent. One selected tag location hides 1 bit andis only tagged if the bit to embed is set to one. To recover anembedded bit, the difference between the original and thetagged image is computed. Then the mean of a supposedlytagged location is compared to the neighboring mean todetermine the bit value. In addition to the marking process,Caronni also suggests to use the correlation coefficientbetween the original and the tagged image as a measurefor the image degradation due to the tagging process.A correlation coefficient of one indicates that the twoimages are identical, whereas for distorted images the valuedecreases toward zero.In the same year, approaches and ideas for digital imagewatermarking were proposed by Tirkel et al. 136 intheir 1993 publication entitled Electronic Water Mark. Inthis early publication on digital watermarking, the authorsalready recognized the importance of digital watermarkingand proposed possible applications for image tagging, copyright enforcement, counterfeit protection, and controlledaccess to image data. Two methods were proposed forgrayscale images. In the first approach, the watermark inform of an sequencederived PN code is embedded inthe least significant bit LSB plane of the image data. ToTable 1Sample Cipher Key Tablegain full access to the LSB plane without introducing muchdistortion, the image is first compressed to 7 bits throughadaptive histogram manipulation. This method is actuallyan extension to simple LSB coding schemes in whichthe LSBs are replaced by the coding information. Thewatermark decoding is straightforward since the LSB planecarries the watermark without any distortion. In the secondapproach, the watermark, again in form of an sequencederived code, is added to the LSB plane. The decodingprocess makes use of the unique and optimal autocorrelationfunction of sequences 86. A modified version of thepaper was published in 1994 139 titled A Digital Watermark, and being the first publication explicitly mentioning,and hence defining, the term digital watermarking. In 1995137, the idea of using sequences and LSB additionwas extended and improved by the authors through the useof twodimensional 2D sequences which resulted inmore robust watermarks.About the same time Matsui and Tanaka 90 publisheda paper called Video Steganography How to SecretlyEmbed a Signature in a Picture, in which several watermarking techniques were proposed for image watermarking.Their first method is based on a predictive coding schemefor gray scale images. Predictive coding schemes exploit thecorrelation between adjacent pixels by coding the predictionerror instead of coding the individual gray scale values. Adigital image is scanned in a predefined order traversingthe pixels The set of pixels is then codedusing a predictive coding scheme by keeping the first valueand replacing subsequent values by the differencebetween adjacent pixels6To embed a watermark in form of a binary string, Matsuiand Tanaka introduce a cipher key table which assignsa corresponding bit to all possible differencesAn example of such a table is given in Table 1. Thecorrespondence between bit values and the differences iskept secret. To embed a bit select a pixel with itscorresponding difference Check in the cipher table ifthe bit value corresponding to has the samevalue as bit If this is the case, proceed to the next bit,otherwise select the closest value to in the cipher tablethat has the appropriate bit value. The watermark can berecovered by looking up the bit in the coding table. Thesecond method modifies the ordered dithering scheme forbinary pictures. A dithering scheme consists of comparingthe monotone level of pixels within a pixel block with apositiondependent threshold and turning on those pixelswith a value above the threshold. The location dependentthresholds are given in a square matrix of sizecalled dither matrix with entries , where denotes anordering number between zero and and and theHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1085Fig. 4. Sample dither matrix dotconcentrated type.corresponding matrix line and column, respectively. Fig. 4shows a sample dithering matrix. Given the dither matrix,the corresponding thresholds are defined as7where defines the dynamic brightness range of the image.To dither an image, it is first divided into adjacent blocks ofthe same size as the dither matrix. Then all values in eachblock are compared to the corresponding threshold valueand modified accordingly. Now let the set set of thresholdpairs be defined as8where denote thresholds in the dither matrix. Further,let be the output signal of and assuming thevalues of and Only the twopairs 0, 1 and 1, 0 are considered for data embedding.To embed a bit an output pair is selected, andis compared with the bit value If the values are equal,the pair is left unchanged, otherwise and are swapped.In order to decode an embedded signature, the abovedescribed procedure is inverted. Again, the pairsand are disregarded. The third scheme is proposedto watermark facsimile documents. Facsimile documentsare scanned with a horizontal resolution of about 8.23pixelsmm and then compressed using run length encodingRLE followed by modified Huffman coding MH. Theembedding process modifies the run lengths between twosubsequent, changing pels. If a one is to be embedded, therun length is forced to be even, whereas for a zero the runlength is forced to be odd. For valid embedding, the originalrun length has to be larger than one. Decoding an embeddedbit is achieved by looking at the decoded run length. Theirlast method is based on the modification of DCT coefficients in a progressive transmission scheme. The watermarkbits are embedded by modifying the rounding rule for thequantized coefficients such that the resulting coefficientsare odd or even, depending on the watermark bits.It was soon recognized that digital watermarking anddigital modulation, and especially direct sequence spreadspectrum modulation 40, 102, 119, 140, share similar concepts, and it was proposed to consider digitalwatermarking as communication in nonGaussian noise.First theoretical approaches were proposed by Smith 120.A more in depth analysis of 2D multipulse amplitudemodulation was given by Hernandez et al. 53.Since the abovementioned first publications, the interestand research activities on watermarking have largely increased. Multimedia content providers and distributors areespecially interested in working solutions. In the following,we present some of the more recent work and start theoverview with methods working in the spatial domain.Bender et al. 6 propose two methods for data hiding.In the first method, called Patchwork, randomly selectedpairs of pixels are used to hide 1 bit by increasingthe s by one and decreasing the s by one. Provided thatthe image satisfies some statistical properties, the expectedvalue of the sum of the differences between the s ands of pixel pairs is given byfor watermarked pairsfor nonwatermarked pairs.9In the second approach, called Texture Block Coding,the watermark is embedded by copying one image textureblock to another area in the image with a similar texture. Torecover the watermark, the autocorrelation function has tobe computed. A remarkable feature of this technique is thehigh robustness to any kind of distortion, since both imageareas are distorted in a similar way, which means that thewatermark recovery by autocorrelation still works.Pitas and Kaskalis propose signature casting on digitalimages 93, 103, 104, which is based on the same basicidea as the patchwork algorithm proposed by Bender et al.6. The watermark consists of a binary patternof the same size as the original image and where the numberof ones is equal to the number of zeros. The originalimage with luminance values at location andand , is divided into two sets and of equal size inthe following way10The watermark is superimposed by changing the elementsof the subset by a positive integer factor e.g.,The watermarked image is thengiven by the union of and To verify the presenceof a watermark, hypothesis testing 97 is applied. The teststatistic is defined as the normalized difference betweenthe mean of set and the mean of set11where and defines the sample variance of set andrespectively. The test statistic is then compared with athreshold to determine if there is a watermark. The methodis immune to subsampling followed by upsampling and resists to JPEG compression with a compression factor of 1 4.An improved version of this idea has been proposedLangelaar et al. 78, 82. The image is tiled into squareblocks with a size being a multiple of eight. A single bitis embedded by iteratively modifying a pseudorandomly1086 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999selected block. Each selected block has a pseudorandompattern with equal number of 1 and 0 assigned to it.To embed a bit with a value of 1, the scaled patternwhere is a predefined scaling factor definingthe initial minimal watermark strength, is added to theblock. For a bit with a value of 0, the scaled patternis subtracted from the block. Let be the mean of allpixel values within the block for which the correspondingpattern value is zero, and the mean of the remainingpixels. Further, let be the differencebetween the two means, and be thedifference between the means after JPEG compression ofthe block with a predefined quality factor If a 0 isto be embedded, the pattern is iteratively subtractedfrom the block until both differences, andare below zero or the maximum number of iterations hasbeen reached. If a 1 is to be embedded the patternis iteratively added to the block until both differences,and , are above a predefined threshold orthe maximum number of iterations has been reached. Anembedded bit can be extracted by again computing thedifference between the two means and The signof this difference is then used to determine the embeddedbit value. Tests with the parameters set to block size 3232, threshold initial scaling factor andmaximum number of iterations six, indicate that the methodfeatures decent robustness toward JPEG compression witha bit error rate of about 5 for 85 JPEG quality and 20for 60 JPEG quality. In a second method the authorspropose watermarking in the DCT domain by setting DCTcoefficients below a selected scan line to zero.To increase the performance of the block base spatialwatermarking methods, Bruyndonckx et al. 17 suggestthe used of pixel classification. Pixels within pseudorandomly selected blocks are classified into zones 1 and2 of homogeneous luminance values. The classificationis based on three types of contrast between zones hardcontrast progressive contrast and noise contrast. Eachzone is then further subdivided into two categories andbased on a grid defined by the coder. Each pixel isthus assigned to one of four zonecategory combinations,e.g., and A bit is embedded bymodifying the zonecategory means to satisfy the followingconstraintsifif12where and are the modifiedzonecategory mean values and the watermark embeddingstrength. The modification of the mean values is done byapplying equal luminance variations for all pixels belongingto the same zone. To increase robustness the authorssuggest to perform redundant bit embedding and use errorcorrecting codes. Good robustness to JPEG compressionis reported.In order to increase the performance of spreadspectrumwatermarking in the spatial domain Kutter et al. 73,74 propose a method which exclusively works with theblue image component, in the RGB color space, in orderto maximize the watermark strength while keeping visualartifacts minimal. Further, they propose to preprocess theimage prior to watermark decoding in order to predictthe embedded watermark. This concept improves the robustness significantly and is applicable to any spreadspectrum watermarking in the spatial domain. The methodembeds a watermark in form of a binary number throughamplitude modulation in the spatial domain. A single bitis embedded at a pseudorandomly selected location byeither adding or subtracting, depending on the bit, a valuewhich is proportional to the luminance at the same location13where describes the blue value at location ,the luminance at the same location, and , the embeddingstrength. To recover an embedded bit, an estimate of theoriginal, nonwatermarked, value is computed using linearcombination of neighboring pixels in a cross shape14where defines the size of the crossshaped neighborhood.The bit value is determined by looking at the sign of thedifference between the pixel under inspection and theestimated original. In order to increase robustness, eachsignature bit is embedded several times, and to extract theembedded bit the sign of the sum of all differences isused. Fig. 5 illustrates an image composition example. Thetwo watermarked images on the top are used to generatethe new composite image on the bottom. Given the appropriate keys, both original watermarks can be recovered.Extensions to this method allow increased robustness andeven watermark recovery after geometrical attacks 76 andprintingscanning.Macq et al. 37, 87 introduce watermarking adaptedto the human visual system HVS using masking andmodulation. In their scheme, the watermark in form of aspatially limited binary pattern is lowpass filtered, frequency modulated, masked, and then added to the hostimage. A secret key is used to determine the modulationfrequencies and the watermark embedding location. Themasking process uses an extension of the masking phenomena for monochromatic signals, also called gratings.To further adapt the watermark to the image, a shapingmask, based on morphological homogenized areas of highfrequencies, is used. Watermark recovery is performed bydemodulation followed by a correlation function.In a very different approach, Voyatzis and Pitas watermark images by inserting logo like patterns using torusautomorphisms 141, 142. A 2D torus automorphism canbe considered as a spatial transformation of planar regionswhich belong to a square 2D area. It is defined in the subsetHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1087Fig. 5. Image composition. The umbrella of the umbrella image is pasted onto the beachimage. The watermarks from both images can be recovered from the composed image.by15Iterated actions of on a point form a dynamical systemwhich can be expressed like a mapor 16An example for a wellknown automorphism in dynamicsis the cat map, defined as17The set of points is called an orbit ofthe system. Roughly speaking, such a system mixes thepoints in a chaotic way. Under certain circumstances, theautomorphisms may have periodic orbits, which means thatafter iterations the current point is equal to the initialpoint, e.g., Fig. 6 shows an example of anauthomorphism using the cat map.To sign an image, a watermark in the form of a squarebinary image, with a size smaller than the original image,is first mixed using the automorphism The resulting,mixed watermark is then overlaid on a selected blockin the original image using an embedding function suchas LSB modification. Watermark recovery is performedby first extracting the mixed watermark from the signedimage followed by reconstructing the watermark using theautomorphism where is the automorphism periodfor the given system. Using more sophisticated overlayingmethods will increase the robustness of the method.Raymond and Wolfgang 147, 148 propose a watermarking technique to verify image authenticity based onan approach similar to the sequence approach suggestedby Schyndel et al. for the onedimensional case 139 andTirkel et al. for the two dimensional case 137. A randomsequence generated by using linear feedback shift registersis mapped from 0,1 to 1, 1, arranged into a suitableblock and added to the image. To locate where an imagehas been forged, the algorithm overlays the watermarkedimage block with the watermark block, computes the innerproduct, and compares the result to the ideal value. Letthe crosscorrelation function of two blocksand be defined as18then the test statistic for a block, given the original imageblock the watermark block the watermarked imageblock , and the probably forged image block is definedas191088 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999a bc dFig. 6. Example automorphism with the cat map. a is the original image. bd show theautomorphism of a after one, two, and ten iterations, respectively.If the watermark is unchanged, When is greaterthan a defined tolerance, the block fails the watermark test.The method detects any kind of image filtering, and theauthors claim that an improved version can even accommodate JPEG compression.Watermark embedding not based on spreadspectrummodulation but quantization has been proposed by Chenand Wornell 24. Their method is called quantized indexmodulation QIM and is based on a set of dimensionalquantizers. The quantizers satisfy a distortion constraint andare designed such that the reconstruction values from onequantizer are far away from the reconstruction points ofevery other quantizer. The message to be transmitted is usedas in index for quantizer selection. The selected quantizer isthen used to embed the information by quantizing the imagedata in either the spatial or DCT domain. In the decodingprocess, a distance metric is evaluated for all quantizersand the index of the quantizer with the smallest distanceidentifies the embedded information. The authors show thatthe performance of the resulting watermarking scheme issuperior to standard spreadspectrum modulation withoutwatermark weighting.Besides spatial domain watermarking related to modulation it was proposed by Maes et al. 89 to modifygeometric features of the image. The method is basedon a dense line pattern, generated pseudorandomly andrepresenting the watermark. A set of salient points in theimage is then computed, for example, based on an edgedetection filter. The detected points are then warped suchthat a significantly large number of points are within thevicinity of lines. In the detection process, the methodverifies if a significantly large number of points are withinthe vicinity of lines.Related to spatial domain watermarking schemes aremethods based on fractal image compression. The idea touse this approach has first been proposed by 109. In fractalimage compression the image is coded using the principlesof iterated function systems and self similarity 116. Theoriginal image is divided into square blocks called rangeblocks. Further, let be a set of mapping functions ,which are a composed of a geometric transformationand a massic transformation The mapping functionswork on domain blocks , which are larger than rangeblocks. The geometric transformation consists of movingthe domain block to the location of the range blockand reducing the size of the domain block to the size of therange block. The massic transformation adjusts the intensityand orientation of pixels in the domain block after geometric transformation. Massic transformations include rotationby 90, 180, and 90 , reflection at midhorizontal and crossdiagonal axis, as well as identity mapping. To compress animage for all range blocks , the best combination ofdomain block and mapping function has to be foundsuch that the difference between the range block andHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1089the mapped domain block is minimal. That meansthat the encoding includes a spatial search over all possibledomain blocks. Decoding is accomplished by iterating overthe coded mapping functions using any initial image. Toembed a bit into this scheme a range block is pseudorandomly selected. The corresponding search space for therange blocks is then split up into two subsearch spacesand of equal size. Each subspace is assigned to a bitvalue, and the current range block is encoded by searchingonly in the subspace corresponding to the bit value of thecurrent bit. To recover an embedded bit, the image is againcompressed, however this time using the full domain blocksearch space. Then for a marked range block the location ofthe corresponding domain block reveals the embedded bitvalue. The algorithm was tested against JPEG compressionand showed good robustness down to a compression qualityof about 50. A drawback of this technique is the slowspeed due to the fractal compression scheme.A very similar approach has been proposed by Davernand Scott 34. The only difference is that they do notencode the entire image, but only a userdefined rangeregion based on a userdefined domain region. Given thetwo regions, the watermark encoding is equivalent to thesystem proposed by Puate and Jordan in that the domainregion is divided into two parts and, depending on thebit value, one or the other region is used for encodinga range block. This idea of watermarking using spatialdomain fractal image coding has been extended to DCTblocks by Bas et al. 4.Efficient watermarking in the DCT domain was firstintroduced by Koch et al. 18, 68, 69. As in the JPEGcompression scheme, the image is first divided into squareblocks of size 8 8 for which the DCT is computed. Froma pseudorandomly selected block, a pair of midfrequencycoefficients is selected from 12 predetermined pairs. Toembed a bit, the coefficients are then modified such thatthe difference between them is either positive or negative,depending on the bit value. In order to accommodate lossyJPEG compression, the quantization matrix is taken intoaccount when altering the DCT coefficients. This methodshows good robustness to JPEG compression down to aquality factor of 50.Bors and Pitas 12, 13 suggest a method that modifiesDCT coefficients satisfying a block site selection constraint.The image is first divided into blocks of size 8 8.Certain blocks are then selected according to a Gaussiannetwork classifier decision. The middle range frequencyDCT coefficients are then modified, using either a linearDCT constraint or a circular DCT detection region, toconvey the watermark information. In the first approach,the linear constraint is defined as20where is the modified DCT coefficient vector andthe weighting vector provided by the watermark. Theconstraint is imposed by changing the DCT coefficientsbased on a leastsquares criterion. The second algorithmdefines circular regions around the selected DCT frequencycoefficients. The selected frequencies are then quantizedaccording tothen 21where is the set of coefficient vectorsprovided by the watermark. In the watermark recoveryprocess, the algorithm first verifies the DCT coefficientconstraint for all blocks followed by the location constraint.The algorithm can accommodate JPEG compression for acompression ratio of 13 1 and 18 1 using the linear DCTconstraint or the circular DCT detection region, respectively.Swanson et al. 129, 130 suggest a DCT domainwatermarking technique, based on frequency masking ofDCT blocks, which is similar to methods proposed bySmith and Comiskey 120. The input image is split upinto square blocks for which the DCT is computed. Foreach DCT block, a frequency mask is computed basedon the knowledge that a masking grating raises the visualthreshold for signal gratings around the masking frequency.The resulting perceptual mask is scaled and multiplied bythe DCT of a maximal length PN sequence. This watermarkis then added to the corresponding DCT block followed byspatial masking to verify that the watermark is invisible andto control the scaling factor. Watermark detection requiresthe original image as well as the original watermark andis accomplished by hypothesis testing. The authors reportgood watermark robustness for JPEG compression, colorednoise, and cropping.Tao and Dickinson 133 introduce an adaptive DCTdomain watermarking technique based on a regional perceptual classifier with assigned sensitivity indexes. Thewatermark is embedded in AC DCT coefficients. Thecoefficients are selected as to have the smallest quantizationstep sizes according to the default JPEG compression table.The selected coefficients are modified as follows22where defines the noise sensitivity index for the currentblock, the quantization step for and satisfiesIt should be noted that the watermark signalis not generated randomly. Various approaches exist todetermine the noise sensitivity by efficiently exploitingthe masking effects of the HVS. The authors propose aregional classification algorithm which classifies the blockin one of six perceptual classes. The classification algorithmexploits luminance masking, edge masking, and texturemasking effects of the HVS. Namely the perceptual blockclasses from one to six are defined as edge uniformlow sensitivity moderately busy busy and very busy, indescending order of noise sensitivity. Each perceptual classhas a noisesensitivity index assigned to it. Watermark recovery requires the original image as well as the watermarkand is based on hypothesis testing. Experiments show thatthe method resists JPEG compression down to a quality1090 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999of 5 and can accommodate random noise with a peaksignaltonoise ratio PSNR of 22.1 dB.Podilchuk 107, 108 introduces perceptual watermarking using the just noticeable difference JND to determinean imagedependent watermark modulation mask. The watermark modulation onto selected coefficients in either theDCT or wavelet transform domain can be described asifotherwise23where are the transform coefficients of the originalimage, are the watermark values, and isthe computed JND based on visual models. For DCTcoefficients, the author suggest using a perceptual modeldefined by Watson based on utilizing frequency and brightness sensitivity as well as local contrast masking. Thismodel provides imagedependent masking thresholds foreach 8 8 DCT block. Watermark detection is basedon the correlation between the difference of the originalimage and the image under inspection and the watermarksequence. The maximum correlation is compared to athreshold to determine whether an image contains the watermark in question. Experiments showed that the watermarkscheme is extremely robust to JPEG compression, cropping, scaling, additive noise, gamma correction, and printingxeroxingscanning. For attacks involving a geometricaltransformation, the inverse operation has to be applied tothe image before the watermarkdetection process.Piva et al. describe another DCTbased method whichexploits the masking characteristics of the HVS 105. Thewatermark consists of a pseudorandom sequence of realnumbers with normal distributionThe coefficients of the DCT of the original imageare reordered into a vector using a zigzag scan. Fromthis vector, coefficients, starting at position , areselected to generate the vector Thewatermark is embedded into according to24where determines the watermark strength. The modifiedcoefficients replace the nonmodified coefficients before thewatermarked image is reconstructed. In order to enhancethe robustness visual masking is applied as follows25where is a weighting factor taking into account thecharacteristics of the HVS. A simple way of choosingis the normalized sample variance at pixel defined asthe ratio between the sample variance for a square blockwith center at and the maximum of all block variances.As in most schemes, watermark detection is performed bycomparing the correlation between the watermark andthe possibly corrupted signed DCT coefficients with athreshold The correlation is defined as26The threshold is adaptive and given as27Experimental results demonstrate that the watermark isrobust to several image processing techniques for example,JPEG compression, median filtering, and multiple watermarking and geometrical distortions after applying theinverse geometric transformation.Frequencydomain watermarking was first introduced byBoland et al. 8 and Cox et al. 27, who independentlydeveloped perceptually adaptive methods based on modulation. Cox et al. draw parallels between their technologyand spreadspectrum communication since the watermarkis spread over a set of visually important frequency components. The watermark consists of a sequence of numberswith a given statistical distribution, suchas a normal distribution with zero mean and avariance of one. The watermark is inserted into the imageto produce the watermarked image Three techniquesare proposed for watermark insertion282930where determines the watermark strength and the sare perceptually significant spectral components. Equation28 is only suitable if the values do not vary too much.Equations 29 and 30 give similar results for small valuesof , and for positive s 30 may even be viewed asan application of 28 where the logarithms of the originalvalues are used. In most cases 29 is used. The scheme canbe generalized by introducing multiple scaling parametersas to adapt to the different spectral components andthus reduce visual artifacts. To verify the presence of thewatermark, the similarity between the recovered watermarkgiven by the difference between the original imageand the possibly tampered image and the originalwatermark is measured. The similarity measure is givenby the normalized correlation coefficient31Robustness tests showed that the method resistsJPEG compression at a quality factor of 5and no smoothing, dithering, fax transmission,printingphotocopyingscanning, multiple watermarking,and collusion attacks. For the experiments, the watermarkwas of length 1000 with where representsa normal distribution with mean and variance ,was set to 0.1, and the watermark was embedded into the1000 strongest DCT coefficients using 29. Boland et al.propose a similar technique based on a hybrid betweenamplitude modulation and frequency shift keying andsuggest the use of different transform domains such asDCT, wavelet transform, WalshHadamard transform, andthe fast Fourier transform FFT.HARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1091Fig. 7. RST invariant watermarking scheme.Ruanaidh et al. propose watermarking by modification ofthe phase in the frequency domain 112, 113. To embeda bit the phase of a selected coefficient of anby , DFT is modified by adding a small32in order for the watermarked image to be real, the phasemust satisfy negative symmetry, which leads to the additional modification33Coefficients are only modified if their relative power isabove a given threshold. If the original image is available,the watermark can easily be recovered by comparing thephase. In case the original is not available, Ruanaidhsuggests prequantizing the original phase prior to modifyingit. Then deviations between the quantized states could beused to convey the data.In another publication, Ruanaidh et al. explicitly designa watermarking technique invariant to translation, rotation,and scaling 114. The method is a hybrid between DFTand logpolar mapping. The process is depicted in Fig. 7.In a first step, the DFT of the image is computed. Oneof the DFT properties is that a shift in the spatial domainresults in a phase shift in the frequency domain. Keepingonly the amplitude for further processing makes the imagetranslation invariant. In the second step, rotation and scaleinvariance is achieved by mapping the amplitude fromthe Cartesian grid to a logpolar grid. Consider a pointthen the mapping is defined as34where and One can easily see that thisis a onetoone mapping and that rotation and scaling inthe Cartesian grid are converted to a translation of theand coordinates, respectively. Computing again theDFT of the logpolar map and keeping only the amplituderesults in a rotation and translation invariant. Taking theFourier transform of a logpolar map is equivalent tocomputing the FourierMellin transform. Hence combiningthe two steps results in a rotation, scale, and translationRST transformation invariant. The watermark takes theform of a two dimensional spreadspectrum signal in theRST transformation invariant domain. In a test, a 104bitwatermark was embedded into an image. The watermarkedimage was then rotated by 143 and scaled by 75 alongeach axis. The embedded watermark was recovered fromthis image. Further, the method resists JPEG compressiondown to a quality factor of 75 and cropping to 50 ofthe original image size. This approach, which is actuallythe first one which was especially designed as to resist togeometrical attacks, has interesting aspects and ideas andmight trigger a new way of approaching the design of futurewatermarking techniques. A variation of this idea based onthe Radon transform has been proposed by Wu et al. 150.Embedding the watermark using a multiresolution decomposition has first been proposed by Boland et al. 8. Asfor schemes working in other transformation domains, thewatermark is usually given by a pseudorandom 2D pattern.Both the image and watermark are decomposed using a 2D wavelet transform, and in each subband of the imagea weighted version of the watermark is added. Watermarkdecoding is, as usual, based on a normalized correlationbetween and estimate of the embedded watermark and thewatermark itself. Various wavelet based schemes have beenproposed 58, 71, 151, 152. The difference betweenthe schemes usually lies in the way the watermark isweighted in order to decrease visual artifact.In this section we have presented several different watermarking methods. It can be recognized that most watermarking methods are based on the same basic principle small, pseudorandom changes are applied to selected coefficients in the spatial or transform domain.This changes are later on identified by correlation orcorrelationlike similarity measures. Usually, the numberof modified coefficients is much larger than the number ofinformation bits to be encoded. This can be considered asredundant embedding and leads to implicit robustness. Aswe have seen, the watermark embedding domain may havea substantial influence on the watermark robustness. Spatialdomain watermarking schemes are in general less robusttoward noise like attacks, for example, due to lossy JPEGcompression. However, a big advantage is the fact that thewatermark may easily be recovered if the image has beencropped or translated. This is less obvious if the frequencydomain is used. Cropping in the spatial domain results ina substantially large distortion in the frequency domain,which usually destroys the embedded watermark. The sameis true for the fullframe DCT domain. If DCT blocks arewatermarked, it is important to know the block position forsuccessful watermark decoding. The wavelet domain hasvery similar drawbacks because the wavelet transform isneither shift nor rotation invariant. Most proposed methodswatermark in the spatial domain. This is probably due tothe simplicity and efficiency of such methods. The numberof publications on DCTbased methods is also large.1092 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999VI. VIDEO WATERMARKINGVideo sequences consist of a series of consecutive andequally timespaced still images. Thus, the general problemof watermarking seems very similar for images and videosequences, and the idea that image watermarking techniquesare directly applicable to video sequences is obvious. Thisis partly true, and there are a lot of publications on imagewatermarking which conclude with the remark that theproposed approach is also applicable to video. Since imagewatermarking has been covered in great detail in Section V,we do not repeat it here, even if some of them carry theword video in the title 26. However, there are also someimportant differences between images and video whichsuggest specific approaches for video.One important difference is the available signal space.For images, the signal space is very limited. This motivatesmany researchers to employ implicit or explicit models ofthe HVS, in order to reach the threshold of visibility and toembed a watermark as robust as possible without sacrificingimage quality. Examples have been cited in Section V. Forvideo, the available signal space, i.e., the number of pixels,is much larger. On the other hand, video watermarkingoften imposes realtime or nearrealtime constraints onthe watermarking system. As a consequence, it is lessimportant, and for many applications even prohibitivelycomplex, to use watermarking methods based on explicitmodels of the HVS. Complexity in general is a much moreimportant issue for video watermarking applications than itis for image watermarking applications.For individual watermarking, i.e., fingerprinting, of videosequences for example, embedding of a receiver ID, thisproblem is even more severe because video sequences areusually stored in compressed format. Uncompressed storageand onthefly compression, or decompression, watermarking, and recompression, are usually not feasible for thiskind of application, unlike for images. Thus, such applications may require compresseddomain watermarking, aspresented in 47, 49, and 80 and discussed below.Another point to consider is that the structure of video asa sequence of still images gives rise to particular attacks,for example, frame averaging, frame dropping, and frameswapping 47, 126. At frame rates of 2530 Hz, asthey are used in television, this would possibly not beperceived by the casual viewer. A good watermarkingscheme, however, should be able to resist to this kind ofattack, for example, by distributing watermark informationover several consecutive frames. On the other hand, it mightbe desirable to retrieve the full watermark information froma short part of the sequence. It depends on the application ofwhich of those two competing requirements is realized orboth, e.g., by embedding a multiscale watermark with morethan one temporal scale 126 or progressive watermarktransmission 33.While a lot of research has been published on imagewatermarking, there are fewer publications that deal withvideo watermarking. However, the interest in such techniques is high, for example, the emerging digital versatiledisk DVD standard which will contain a copy protectionsystem employing watermarking.1 The goal is to markall copyrighted video material such that DVD standardcompliant players or recorders will refuse to play back orrecord pirated material.In the following, some watermarking methods exploitinguncompressed or compressed video properties are discussed. Some other methods that have been proposed butare in fact image watermarking techniques applied to imagesequences with or without subsequent compression are notdiscussed here.Hartung and Girod 4749 have concentrated on watermarking of compressed video for fingerprinting applications. They employ a straightforward spreadspectrumapproach and embed an additive watermark into the video.The watermark is generated using a PN signal with thesame dimensions as the video signal that is modulated withthe information bits to be conveyed. Each information bitis redundantly embedded into many pixels. For each compressed video frame, the corresponding watermark signalframe is DCT transformed on an 8 8 blockbyblockbasis, and the resulting DCT coefficients are added to theDCT coefficients of the video as encoded in the videobitstream. This is done for and frames. A ratecontrol is realized by individually comparing the numberof bits for each encoded watermarked DCT coefficient versus the corresponding encoded unwatermarked coefficient.Due to variable length coding, the watermarked coefficientmay or may not need more bits for encoding than theunwatermarked one. If more bits are required, and thebit rate of the video sequence may not be increased, thecoefficient is not used for embedding. Due to the inherentredundancy in the watermark, the watermark informationcan still be conveyed as long as enough coefficients canbe embedded. Visible artifacts, as they could be produceddue to the iterative structure of hybrid video coding, areavoided by applying a drift compensation scheme. Theadded drift compensation signal is the difference of themotion compensated predictions from the unwatermarkedand the watermarked sequence. Fig. 8 shows a basic blockdiagram of the method. The bit stream has to be parsedand the watermark has to be transformed with the DCT.However, the method does not require full decompressionand recompression. The complexity of the scheme is inthe same order of magnitude as decompression, and theembedded watermarks pertain in the video after decompression. The scheme is compatible with all DCTbased hybridcompression schemes, for example, MPEG2, MPEG4,and ITUT H.263. MPEG4 has tools for compression ofarbitrarily shaped objects. For nonrectangular border blocksof such objects, the shapeadaptive DCT SADCT 118is used instead of the DCT. The watermarking scheme isalso applicable to such border blocks, only that the DCTof the watermark has to be replaced by the SADCT. Thewatermark is recovered from the decompressed video bycorrelation using the same PN sequence that was used1 As of April 1999, two competing proposals from two different industryconsortia are under evaluation.HARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1093Fig. 8. Block diagram of watermark embedding into DCT coefficients of compressed video.for generation of the embedded watermark signal. Typicalwatermark data rates are up to 50 bitss, depending on therobustness requirements. The watermarks are robust againststandard signal processing and with a modified watermarkdetector, as proposed in 50 also, to a certain extent, againstgeometrical distortions like shift, zoom, and rotation.Jordan et al. 62 have proposed a method for thewatermarking of compressed video that embeds informationin the motion vectors of motioncompensated predictionschemes. Motion vectors pointing to flat areas are slightlymodified in a pseudorandom way. Because the blockspointed to by the original and the modified vectors are verysimilar there is not much detail, this does not introduceany visible artifacts. The embedded information can beretrieved directly from the motion vectors, as long as thevideo is in compressed format. After decompression, thewatermark can still be retrieved by first recompressing thevideo. This works because during recompression the watermarked motion vectors will be found with a probabilityhigh enough to statistically recover the watermark. Thecomplexity of the method is negligible.Hsu and Wu present a watermarking method 56, 57for compressed video which is an extension of their methodfor images 55 and which modifies middlefrequency DCTcoefficients in relation to spatially for Iframes or temporally for P and Bblocks neighboring blocks. Thecoefficients are forced to assume a smaller or larger valuethan the corresponding neighboring coefficients, dependingon the watermark sample to be embedded into the specificcoefficient. The watermark signal is a visual pattern, likea logo, consisting of binary pixels. Prior to embedding,the watermark signal is spatially scrambled such that itcan be recovered from a cropped version of the video. Adrawback of the scheme is that for watermark extractionthe watermarked video, the unwatermarked video, and thewatermark have to be known.In 80, Langelaar et al. propose two different informationembedding schemes for compressed video. According tothe different robustness and the definitions that we made inSection II, we call one of the methods a datahiding methodand the other a watermarking method. The datahidingmethod adds the label directly in the MPEG1 or MPEG2 bit stream by replacing variable length codes VLCSof DCT coefficients. In MPEG and other hybrid codingschemes, the quantized DCT coefficients are encoded usingrunlevel encoding and subsequent variable length coding.In the MPEG2 code tables there exist pairs of codes whichrepresent the same run and levels that deviate only by onefrom each other. One of the codes is then assigned a 1, theother one a 0. The idea is to find VLCs in the bit streamfor which such a similar code exists, and to eventuallyreplace one by the other such that the bit to be embedded iscoded in the choice of the VLC. In principle, this could bedone for intra and intercoded blocks, but the authors alteronly intracoded blocks. Still, they can embed up to 8 kbitssinto TV resolution video. The authors do admit, however,that the label can be removed easily by decompression andrecompression without seriously affecting the video quality.The watermarking method is more complex, but also morerobust. It is based on discarding parts of the compressedvideo bitstream. For each information bit to be embedded,a set of blocks is pseudorandomly taken fromthe video frame and, also pseudorandomly, divided intotwo subsets of equal size. typically varies between 16and 64. For each of the two subsets, the energy of thehighfrequency DCT coefficients is measured. In order toembed the bit, the energy of the highfrequency coefficientsin one or the other subset is reduced by removing highfrequency coefficients. The principle is illustrated in Fig. 9.For ease of understanding, consecutive blocks are used,rather than blocks randomly taken from the image. Theinformation bit can be extracted by selecting the same setof blocks, dividing it into the same subsets, and comparingthe energy of the highfrequency coefficients in each of thetwo subsets. Thus, the selection of blocks is the secret keyinvolved. The method requires only partial decoding andno reencoding. For TV resolution, up to 400 bitss can beembedded. However, the robustness is limited. Reencodingincreases the error rate of the embedded bits much, and themethod does not resist reencoding using another group1094 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999Fig. 9. Principle of DCT watermarking by comparison of the energy in the highfrequentcoefficients. Courtesy of G. Langelaar.ofpicture GOP structure, since the DCT coefficients ofa block are different depending on whether the frame isencoded as I, P, or B frame however, in this case itis possible to extract the watermark by decoding and reencoding the sequence with the same GOP structure thatit had during watermarking 77. Since DCT coefficientsof the video are removed, care must be taken to adjust theparameters properly 79 in order to avoid visible blurring.Swanson et al. 126, 127 propose a multiscale watermarking method working on uncompressed video whichhas some interesting properties. In a first step, the videosequence to be watermarked is segmented into scenes.Each scene is handled as an entity in the following. Atemporal wavelet transform is then applied to each videoscene, yielding temporal lowpass and highpass frames.The watermark to be embedded is not an arbitrary message,but rather a unique code identifying the IPR owner andtaken from a predefined codebook. In the design of thewatermark, an explicit model of the HVS is employedin order to exploit spatial and temporal masking. Also,the watermark is designed with a signaldependent keyand thus avoids deadlock problems, as addressed in 30.The watermark is embedded into each of the temporalcomponents of the temporal wavelet transform, and thewatermarked coefficients are then inversely transformed toget the watermarked video. Thus, the watermark has somecomponents that change over time, while others do not oronly slowly change over time, since they are embeddedin the coefficients representing low temporal frequencies.This allows robustness against attacks like frame averaging,frame dropping, and the detection of the watermark froma frame of the scene without knowledge of its actualindex. This is a property that the other video watermarkingmethods mentioned here do not automatically have. Othervideo watermarking schemes could, however, achieve thatwith appropriate design of the watermark that they embed.The watermark detection is done by hypothesis testingthe watermark is there or the watermark is not there.Experimental results show the robustness of the schemeagainst additive noise, MPEG video compression, and evenFig. 10. Example for the structure of I, P, and B frames in a GOP.frame drop. A disadvantage of the scheme is that it hasa very high complexity, since it involves a forward and abackward wavelet transform, and an explicit model of theHVS including a blockwise DCT.Linnartz et al. 83 propose to embed information encoded in the GOP structure of the MPEG2 compressedvideo. In MPEG2, video frames can be encoded in threedifferent ways as intracoded I frames coded JPEG likeand without reference to other frames as P frames predicted from previous frames or as B frames bidirectionallypredicted from previous and following frames. I framesare needed as random access points. Usually, there is amaximum distance between two successive I frames inorder to allow random access with a maximum delay.The frame type is signaled in the frame header and canbe switched randomly from frame to frame. The set offrames from one I frame including the I frame to thenext excluding the next is referred to as GOP seeFig. 10. Possible GOP structures are for example IPPP,IBBPBBPBBPBB, IBBBBBBBB, or IPBPBBB, andin fact there are possible GOP structures for GOPsof N frames. A popular GOP size is, for example,thus allowing as many as 2048 different variations.However, most available video codecs use a fixed GOP sizeand structure, and never use most of the admissible GOPstructures. The idea for data embedding is to purposelyuse those irregular GOP structures, that are very unlikely,to embed information. Linnartz et al. propose a schemewhere they embed 6 bits of information per GOP, whichmeans very few bytes per second. The method can onlybe employed during compression, not after compressionwhere the GOP structure is already fixed. Also, informationembedded as such is not resistant to decompression. Thus,decompression and recompression would already removethis information completely. Another disadvantage mightHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1095be that this type of watermark contradicts efforts to improve coding efficiency using ratedistortion optimized ratecontrol 145, because such ratedistortion optimized videocodecs are not restricted to a predefined GOP structure.A plus of the method is certainly that its complexity isnegligible.Darmstaedter et al. 33 propose to embed a spatialdomain lowpass spreadspectrum watermark into 88 pixel blocks of video sequences. The blocks are firstclassified according to their activity. Blocks with lowactivity are not watermarked. A lowpass pseudorandompattern is then added to each selected block. In principle,each block 64 pixels conveys one bit watermark information, but the bits are redundantly repeated over severalblocks and several frames. Also, the authors apply an errorcorrecting code. After watermark embedding, the sequenceis compressed using MPEG2 compression. Watermarkextraction is done in the spatial domain after decompressionusing a correlation concept with thresholding. In orderto achieve errorfree watermark retrieval for compressiondown to a video bit rate of 6 Mbits, the authors embedone bit of watermark information into a total of 162 000pixels.2 The authors have verified the method, including realtransmission over digital satellite links, and optimized theembedding parameters manually. Depending on block meanand block variance, the individual pixels PCM encodedwith 8 bit are modified by up to 6.Dittmann et al. 39 apply two previously proposed stillimage watermarking methods 44, 69 to video. The videois decompressed prior to watermarking and recompressedafter watermarking. The authors are not precise aboutvideo formats, encoding parameters, or other details, butthey admit that after recompression, and using an errorcorrecting BCH 31, 6, 15 code, residual bit error rates of15 for the watermark information bits remain. Alreadywith slight attacks like format conversion from MPEG2 toQuicktime, the bit error rates increase significantly. Thus,at least the parameters of the scheme are obviously notchosen adequately.Deguillaume et al. 36 propose to embed a spreadspectrum watermark into 3D blocks of video by employinga 3D DFT and adding to the transform coefficients. Thewatermark is composed of the real watermark and anauxiliary pattern, called template, that is easy to detecteven under geometric attacks and that can be used to undosuch attacks to enable retrieval of the real watermark. Theblocks that are processed consist of typically 16 or 32frames. Since the template is embedded into the 3D logloglog map of the DFT, it is not affected by zoom andshift 115. Results are reported for an 88bit watermarkembedded into 3D blocks of 32 CIF resolution 352288 pixels frames each giving a watermark data rate of 1bit per 36 864 pixels. The reported bit error rates are 0after highquality compression bit rate 4.75 Mbitss for CIF25 Hz 35, but without attack, and they go up to around20 in the presence of aspectratio changes and framerate2 64 bits are embedded into 25 frames of ITUR 601 resolution video720  576 pixels.changes, even though the changes are recognized with helpof the template and compensated. Thus, it seems that theparameters of the scheme should be chosen such that thewatermark is embedded more robustly than presented inthe simulations.Busch et al. 19 apply a stillimage watermarkingmethod working on DCT blocks 69 to video sequences. The watermarks are embedded into the luminancecomponent of uncompressed video and retrieved afterdecompression. In order to improve the invisibility ofthe watermarks, especially at edges, blocks are selectedfor watermarking depending on the block activity.For watermarking and watermark retrieval of a 64bitwatermark into each frame of ITUR 601 video thatmeans into 5280 pixelsbit and subsequent MPEG2compression at 46 Mbits, bit error rates between 0 and50 are reported, depending on the sequence. For criticalsequences, the authors propose to introduce additionaltemporal redundancy by embedding the watermark intoseveral consecutive frames and averaging in the retrieval.For individual difficult sequences, averaging over 50 framescorresponding to the embedding of one watermark bit into264 000 pixels still yields bit error rates of a few percent,and the authors propose averaging over an even highernumber of frames for synthetic video.Kalker et al. 65 have developed a video watermarkingmethod for video broadcast monitoring applications whichthey call JAWS just another watermarking system. Forthe sake of low complexity, both watermark embedding anddetection are performed in the spatial domain, which meansprior to compression and after decompression, respectively.The embedded watermark consists of watermark patternsof size 128 128 drawn from a white random processwith Gaussian distribution that are repeated tiled to fillthe whole video frame. In order to avoid visible artifacts,the watermark is, on a pixelbypixel basis, scaled witha scaling factor which is derived from an activity measure. The activity measure is computed using a Laplacianhighpass filter. The same watermark is embedded intoseveral consecutive video frames. For watermark detection, a correlation detector is used after applying a spatialprefilter that reduces cross talk between video signal andwatermark. Since the watermark must be detected even inthe presence of spatial shifts, a search over all possibleshifts is performed. Since the watermark signal is generatedby tiling of a smaller watermark pattern, only 128128 positions have to be searched, according to the sizeof the watermark pattern. In order to reduce complexity,the search and correlation is done in the FFT domain.Further, only the phase information of the FFT is usedin the correlation. This method of detection has beenpreviously proposed for pattern recognition and is referredto as symmetrical phase only filtering SPOMF. In orderto embed arbitrary watermark information, the watermarksignal is designed using several different basic watermarkpatterns. The information is encoded in the choice of thebasic patterns and their relative positions. The watermarkcan convey up to about 3550 bitss, but for applications1096 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999that require less watermark information per second thewatermark data rate is reduced for increased robustness63. The methods is claimed to be robust against MPEG2compression down to 2 Mbitss, format conversion, scaling,and addition of noise.Summarizing the above mentioned watermarking methods for video, a few general observations can be made.1 The proposed methods span a wide complexity rangefrom very low complexity to considerable complexityincluding, e.g., wavelet transforms and models ofthe HVS. In general however, the more complexmethods seem to embed the watermarks with higherrobustness.2 Most methods operate on uncompressed video onlya few methods can embed watermarks directly intocompressed video. For watermarking of compressedvideo watermarks can be embedded in the DCTcoefficients 47, 49, 80, in the motion vectors62, or in side information like the GOP structure83.3 The reported watermark data rates are between a fewhundred bits per second and a few bits per second fortelevision resolution video. It seems that if robustnessis a real concern realistic data watermark data ratesare not higher than a few bits per second to a fewdozen bits per second. However, this is sufficient formost applications, including DVD.VII. AUDIO WATERMARKINGCompared to images and video, audio signals are represented by much less samples per time interval. Thisalone indicates that the amount of information that can beembedded robustly and inaudibly is much lower than forvisual media. An additional problem in audio watermarkingis that the human audible system HAS is much moresensitive than the HVS, and that inaudibility is much moredifficult to achieve than invisibility for images.Boney et al. 11 propose a spreadspectrum approach foraudio watermarking. They use a PN sequence that is filteredin several stages in order to exploit longterm and shortterm masking effects of the HAS. In order to exploit longterm masking, a masking threshold for each overlappingblock of 512 samples is calculated and approximated usinga tenthorder allpole filter which is then applied on thePN sequence. Shortterm masking is additionally exploitedby weighting the filtered PN sequence with the relativetimevarying energy of the signal in order to attenuatethe watermark signal where the audio signal energy islow. Additionally, the watermark is lowpass filtered byusing a full audio compressiondecompression scheme aslow pass, in order to guarantee that it survives audiocompression. A highpass component of the watermarkis also embedded which improves watermark detectionfrom uncompressed audio pieces but is expected to beremoved by compression. The authors denote the twospectral components of the watermark by lowfrequencywatermark and coding error watermark. The watermarkcan be extracted by hypothesis testing using the original andthe PN sequence and by employing a correlation method.Experimental results show the robustness of the scheme toMPEG1 layer III audio coding, to coarse PCM quantizationusing word lengths down to 6 bitssample instead of 16bitssample as for the original, and additive noise.Bassia and Pitas 5 apply a very straightforward timedomain spreadspectrum watermarking method to audiosignals. They report robustness against audio compression,filtering and resampling.Tilki and Beex 134 have developed a system for aninteractive television application where they embed information into the audio component of a television signal. Theembedded information is detected from the acoustic signalemitted from the television receiver. Though the systemis designed for analog transmission, the principle couldsimilarly be applied to digital signals. The information to beembedded is partitioned in blocks of 35 bits. Each information bit is modulated using a sinusoidal carrier of a specificfrequency and low amplitude and added to the audio signal.The simplified principle is that if the sinusoidal carrier for aspecific bit is present in the signal, the bit is 1, otherwiseit is 0. The frequencies of the sinusoidal carriers are above2.4 kHz, thus at frequencies where the HAS is less sensitive,no explicit model of the HAS is employed. In order toreduce interference from the audio signal itself, the audiosignal is attenuated at frequencies above 2.4 kHz. Thus, theprinciple involves a fidelity loss of the host signal whichseems acceptable for the envisaged application. In order toincrease the robustness, the information bits are protectedby a cyclic redundancy code CRC and bit repetition. Inorder to compensate frequency shift of the whole signal,for example, after analog recording and playback withinaccurate speed, a frequency locking mechanism is appliedusing five special sinusoidal carriers of known frequency.Thus, the scheme is robust against room noise and videotape recording.Bender et al. 6 propose several techniques for watermarking which are applicable to audio. They call thetechniques spreadspectrum coding, echo coding, and phasecoding. Direct sequence spreadspectrum coding is performing biphase shift keying on a carrier wave by usingan encoded binary string and pseudorandom noise. Thecode introduces perceptible noise into the original soundsignal, but by using adaptive coding and redundant codingthe perceptible noise can be reduced. Echo coding is amethod which employs multiple decaying echos to placea peak in the cepstrum at a known location. The result isthat moderate amounts of data can be hidden in a form thatis fairly robust versus analog transmission. Phase codingis a method that employs the phase information as a dataspace. For the encoding, a Fourier transform is applied andthe phase values of each frequency component are linedup as a matrix binary information can be embedded intothis matrix by modifying the phase component. Since thehuman HAS is not very sensitive to the distortion to thephase of the sound, it can be used to encode data withoutintroducing much audible distortion to the original sound.HARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1097Fig. 11. Embedding of visible watermarks into 3D meshes bylocal variation of the mesh density. Figure taken with kindpermission from 94.VIII. WATERMARKING OF OTHER MULTIMEDIA DATAMost watermarking research, publications, and productsare dedicated to images. Less has been published on video,audio, and formatted text watermarking, and even less onwatermarking of other media. However, the underlyingbasic ideas are certainly applicable to almost all kinds ofdigital data.Ohbuchi et al. 94, 95 have proposed methods forembedding visible and invisible watermarks into 3D polygonal models. Such models comprise primitives like points,lines, polygons, and polyhedrons, which are attributed bytheir geometry and their topology. Ohbuchi et al. proposeto modify geometry or topology for watermarking. Indetail, they propose two different methods for embeddingof invisible watermarks for models consisting of triangular meshes. The first method pseudorandomly selectssets of four adjacent triangles and embeds information bydisplacing the vertices of the four triangles in a specificway by up to 1 of the shortest edge of the rectangularbounding box of the entire 3D model. The authors claimthat the modifications are imperceptible and that the methodis resistant to cropping if the watermark information isrepeated several times over the 3D model and to localdeformation. The second method pseudorandomly selectstetrahedron from the mesh and embeds information in thevolume ratio of consecutive tetrahedron by modification ofvertices. This method is robust against cropping and localdeformation. A third method embeds visible watermarksinto meshes by local variation of the mesh density, as shownin Fig. 11.The emerging video compression standard MPEG4 features additional functionalities, besides common video compression, such as modelbased animation of 3D head models using socalled facial animation parameters FAPs.These are parameters like rotate head, open mouth, orraise right cornerlip. The head model used at the receiveris either a predefined generic head and face model or aparticular model that can be transmitted using socalledfacial definition parameters FDPs. The tool for faceanimation allows the compression of headandshoulderscenes, for example, in video telephony applications, withbit rates below 1000 bitss. In 46, Hartung et al. proposea spreadspectrum method for watermarking of MPEG4FAPs. The watermarks are additively embedded into theanimation parameters. Smoothing of the spreadspectrumwatermark by lowpass filtering and an adaptive amplitudeattenuation prevents visible distortions of the animated headmodels. The watermarks can be retrieved by correlationfrom the watermarked parameters, but also from videosequences showing 3D head models animated with thewatermarked parameters, even after modifications such asblockbased compression. Fig. 12 shows examples of videoframes from a sequence rendered from a 3D head modeland animation parameters. In this case, the parameters firsthave to be estimated from the sequence. An interestingpoint is that the watermark is not contained in the waveformrepresentation of the depicted object the pixels, but in thesemantics the way the head and face move.IX. WATERMARK APPLICATIONS, SECURITY,ROBUSTNESS, AND CRYPTOANALYSISA. ApplicationsWe have already seen in Section III that the requirementsand the design constraints for watermarking technologiesstrongly depend on the final application. For obvious reasons there is no universal watermarking method. Although watermarking methods have to be robust in general,different levels of required robustness can be identifieddepending on the specific applicationdriven requirements.In authentication applications, the watermarks have toresist only to certain attacks. Among all possible watermarking applications, authentication watermarks require thelowest level of robustness. The purpose of such watermarksis to authenticate the data content. For example, data canbe watermarked such that the watermark can accommodatelossy compression, but they are destroyed as soon as thedata are manipulated in a different way.Applications such as data monitoring and tracking requirea higher level of robustness. The main purpose is todetect or identify stored or transmitted data. Examples areautomatic monitoring of radio broadcast for billing purposesor identification of images on the World Wide Web with thehelp of web crawlers. For such applications, the watermarkshave to be easily extractable and must be reasonably robust,for example, against standard data processing like formatconversion and compression.In fingerprinting applications, watermarks are embeddedthat identify the recipient of each individual distributedcopy. The purpose is to have a means to trace backpirated copies to the recipient who pirated it. Fingerprintingapplications require a very high level of robustness againstdata processing and malicious attacks.Watermarking for copyright protection is used to resolverightful ownership and requires the highest level of robustness. However, robustness alone is not sufficient for suchapplications. For example, if different watermarks are embedded in the same data, it must still be possible to identifythe first, authoritative, watermark. Hence, additional designrequirements besides mere robustness apply, as discussedbelow.In the following, we go into more details on how to resistmalicious attacks and elaborate on design constraints forcopyright protection applications of watermarking.1098 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999a bFig. 12. Example frame from a video sequence rendered from a a 3D head model andwatermarked animation parameters and b a similar frame after subsequent MPEG2 videocompression at 600 kbits.B. Watermark RobustnessRobustness against attacks is a major watermarking requirement. Absolute robustness against all possible attacksand their combinations may be impossible to achieve. Thus,the practical requirement is that a successful attack mustimpair the host data to the point of significantly reducingits commercial value before the watermark is impaired somuch that it cannot be recovered. In fact, with appropriatedesign, fairly high robustness can be achieved, but it shouldbe pointed out that robustness always has to be tradedagainst watermark data rate and imperceptibility, and theoptimum tradeoff depends on the application.1 Classification of Attacks Following the classificationin 50, four different types of attacks can be identified.1 Simple attacks other possible names includewaveform attacks and noise attacks are conceptually simple attacks that attempt to impairthe embedded watermark by manipulations of thewhole watermarked data host data plus watermarkwithout an attempt to identify and isolate thewatermark. Examples include linear and generalnonlinear filtering, waveformbased compressionJPEG, MPEG, addition of noise, addition of anoffset, cropping, quantization in the pixel domain,conversion to analog, and gamma correction.2 Detectiondisabling attacks other possible namesinclude synchronization attacks are attacks thatattempt to break the correlation and to make therecovery of the watermark impossible or infeasible fora watermark detector, mostly by geometric distortionlike zooming, shift in spatial or temporal for videodirection, rotation, shear, cropping, pixel permutations, subsampling, removal or insertion of pixels orpixel clusters, or any other geometric transformationof the data.3 Ambiguity attacks other possible names includedeadlock attacks, inversion attacks, fakewatermark attacks, and fakeoriginal attacksare attacks that attempt to confuse by producingfake original data or fake watermarked data 54.An example is an inversion attack 3032 thatattempts to discredit the authority of the watermarkby embedding one or several additional watermarkssuch that it is unclear which was the first, authoritativewatermark.4 Removal attacks are attacks that attempt to analyzethe watermarked data, estimate the watermark or thehost data, separate the watermarked data into hostdata and watermark, and discard only the watermark.Examples are collusion attacks 121, denoising, certain nonlinear filter operations 81, or compressionattacks using synthetic modeling of the image e.g.,using texture models or 3D models. Also includedin this group are attacks that are tailored to a specificwatermarking scheme and combat it by exploitingconceptual cryptographic weaknesses of the schemethat make it vulnerable to a specific attack.It should be noted that the transitions between the groupsare sometimes fuzzy and that some attacks do not clearlybelong to one group. Collusion attacks could be arguedto be a group of its own, since they require, unlike theother attacks, more than one differently watermarked copyof the data. However, since they attempt to reconstructthe unwatermarked original host data, and thus remove thewatermarks, the classification as a removal attack holds.In the following, remedies are given that make watermarks more robust against malicous attacks.2 Remedies Against Simple, WaveformBased Attacks Asalready mentioned, noiselike distortions, for example, dueto lossy compression, result in a distorted watermark signalin the watermark recovery or verification process. Thereare two main remedies against such attacks increasingthe embedding strength or applying redundant embedding.Increasing the embedding strength is straightforward andefficient in many cases, especially if appropriate maskingaccording to the properties of human perception is usedto determine the maximum allowable embedding strength.Redundant embedding can be performed in many ways.In the spatial domain it might consist of embedding awatermark many times and then taking a majority votein the recovery process. A more efficient technique couldinclude the use of errorcorrecting codes 52, possiblyHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1099even with softdecision decoding 51. Both increasingthe watermark strength and introducing redundancy eitherincrease the watermark visibilityaudibility or decrease thewatermark data rate. Further, as pointed out before, itshould be noted that there is a tradeoff between watermarkrobustness on one hand and watermark imperceptibility andwatermark data rate on the other hand.3 Geometrical Distortions and Remedies Watermarksare typically most vulnerable to geometrical distortions. Thereason is that, for most proposed watermarking methods,the watermark detector has to know the exact position ofthe embedded watermark. Geometrical distortions tend todestroy the synchronization such that watermark embeddingand watermark detection are misaligned and do not fitanymore.Simple geometric attacks include affine transforms, clipping, and cropping. Remedies against such attacks aredifficult if the watermarking algorithm has not explicitly been designed to withstand such attacks 114. Forthis simple geometrical attacks, the challenge consistsof finding the original watermark reference within thehost data. For watermarking schemes which require theoriginal image to recover the watermark this may notbe a real problem, since the geometrical distortion canbe estimated from the two images and inverted. If thewatermarking scheme does not have the original dataavailable for the watermark recovery, many schemes stillallow the reference recovery by using a full search overall possible manipulations using some kind of correlationcriteria between the image and the watermark modulationsequence. If the geometrical distortion consists of simplecropping, translation, or rotation, this process is feasible.However, if the attack consists of any affine transformthis becomes very intensive computationally. Another wayto resist geometrical attacks is based on embedding awatermark reference within the host data. Gruhl and Bender45 propose embedding invisible crosses into the imageby modifying the LSB image plane. Later detection of thecrosses allows exact determination of the undergone attackand thus its reversal. If resistance to cropping has also to beassured, the row and column information can be encodedin addition to the crosses. One simple way of doing sowould, for example, consist of changing the horizontal andvertical spacing between crosses depending on the locationwithin the image. Although fully functioning, this systemis not very robust since the reference can very easily beremoved or destroyed. Another example is the embeddingof sinusoidal patterns in the color channel using a visibilitymetric to ensure invisibility, as proposed by Fleet andHeeger 42. An extension of the method of Gruhl andBender has been proposed by Kutter 76 in which a spatialwatermark pattern is embedded four times into the hostimage by using predetermined horizontal and vertical shifts.In the recovery process an autocorrelation function of anestimated watermark pattern can be computed to determinethe affine distortion. Applying the inverse transform thenallows full recovery of the watermark. A more sophisticatedgeometrical attack is based on jittering 70, 100, 138.Jittering cuts the data set in small chunks, than randomlyremoves or duplicates small pieces and then sticks the smallchunks back together. If done in a smart way, this alteration introduces only little or even no perceptible artifacts.This attack has proven to be very efficient in removingwatermarks for many algorithms. Remedies exist againstthis attack, depending on the algorithm. For example, themethod proposed by Kutter et al. 74 resists jitteringif the image under inspection is lowpass filtered beforethe watermark extraction process. For other methods thisremedy might work as well.4 Watermark Removal Attacks and Remedies Collusionattacks are attacks that use several copies of the same hostdata with different embedded watermarks. Several types ofcollusion attacks have been examined by Cox et al. 27and Stone 121. In the following, a watermark observationrefers to a watermarked data representation in any domain,e.g., spatial or frequency domain. The first attack is calledstatistical averaging, in which a new data set is created bytaking the average of all available watermark observations.A second attack creates a new data set by taking theaverage of the minimum and maximum of all watermarkobservations. The third approach is based on introducingnegative correlation as followsifotherwise35where and are the median, minimum,and maximum of the all watermark observations. Stoneshows that for the image watermarking scheme proposed byCox et al. 27 and a watermark with uniform distribution,at least four watermark observations are required for asuccessful attack. In general, all these statistical attacks cansuccessfully destroy embedded watermarks even if only afew watermarked data sets are available. Another collusionattack interleaves the different watermarked copies of thesame data 121. Small parts of different watermarked datasets are taken and reassembled in a new data set. A remedyagainst collusion attacks is to limit the available number ofwatermarked copies. Alternatively, it has been proposed touse collusionsecure codes to design watermarks 9, 10.The drawback is that the code lengths increase exponentially with the number of codes.If the watermark detector device is available, the Oracleattack, first proposed by Perrig 98 and further developedby Cox and Linnartz 28, 29, can be used to destroy theembedded watermark. Such a scenario is, for example, possible in copy control systems for digital media, such as theDVD. The watermark detector can be used to experimentally deduce its behavior and then destroy the watermark.Although commonly believed that this approach involvesan extremely high complexity, the authors illustrate thatthis is not true and claim the complexity to be of orderwhere is the number of data samples, for mostwatermarking system. If the watermark inserter is available,another attack is based on predistorting the original dataset. The difference between the watermarked data set and1100 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999original data set is used to predistort the original data setthrough subtraction. The newly watermarked predistorteddata set is then very unlikely to contain the watermark. Oneremedy against a predistortion attack is based on encryptionusing a random session key. Given a binary watermarkto be embedded into a set of data, it is first encrypted usinga random encryption key resulting in The key is thenappended to the encrypted watermark to give the new watermark , which is then embedded into the host data set.The watermark detector can recover the embedded watermark and decrypt it. The predistortion attack fails becausethe watermark inserter is not deterministic anymore due tothe fact that the embedded watermark changes each time.A histogrambased attack called Twin Peaks for fixeddepth bimodal watermarks has been proposed by Maes88. To illustrate the concept of the attack, let us consideran image histogram with a peak at the intensity levelFurther, let us assume that the image was watermarkedwith a uniformly distributed watermark with a bimodalamplitude of In this case, the watermarking processmaps 50 of the values from to and the other50 from to The peak in the original histogram atintensity is therefore replaced by two peaks at intensitiesand hence the name Twin Peaks, bothhaving half the height of the original peak. By lookingat the histogram of a watermarked image, it is possibleto determine the embedded watermark by detecting closeby peaks with similar amplitude. The original value maythen be estimated and substituted into the watermarkedimage in order to destroy the embedded watermark. Basedon this idea, the author show how to successfully destroyembedded watermarks. The performance of the attack maybe improved when a prediction of the embedded watermarkis used instead of the watermarked image. The predictionis computed by filtering the image with a highpass filterwhich can be seen as taking the difference between a pixelvalue and the local mean computed in a squared wind ofsize 3 3.C. Remedies Against Watermark AmbiguitiesAs mentioned at the beginning of this section, to resolverightful ownership, it must be possible to determine theauthoritative watermark in case several watermarks arepresent in a data set.1 Timestamps To determine who first signed a set ofdata, timestamps provided by trusted third parties shouldbe used 117, 149. Let be the data to be time stampedand the corresponding hash value. The owner sends anofficial request where is the ownersidentification string, to an official third party time stampingservice TSS. The TSS produces a timestamp36where is the request number, the time of the request,and indicates that the message is signed with the publickey of TSS. is known as the linking string defined as37and is used to avoid that the timestamp requester and theTSS collude to produce any timestamp they want. TheTSS then waits for the next request and returns the newidentification of the originator. If someone challengesa timestamp , the owner can prove that is was stampedafter and before those by and respectively. Iftheir documents are also called in question they can get intouch with and and so on.Because digital time stamping involves a trusted thirdparty, the question might arise why to use watermarkingin combination with timestamping since this is verysimilar to traditional copyright registration and protectionof copyright laws.2 Noninvertible Watermarks Until the publications ofCraver et al. 3032 it was believed that with the help ofthe original, nonwatermarked data set one can easily proverightful ownership. Craver et al. showed that having theoriginal is not sufficient and introduced the expression ofinvertible watermarking schemes. Given an original dataset to be watermarked with38where is the watermarked original and the operatorrepresents watermark insertion. Craver et al. showedthat certain watermarking methods are invertible and allowreverse engineering to produce a counterfeit original39where it the counterfeit original and the inversionprocess. Let further assume that is a watermark decoderfunction with a binary output of 0 and 1 for watermarkabsent and watermark present, respectively. This scenariocreates an ownership deadlock because the rightful ownercan show that his watermark is presents in the signed dataand counterfeit original40However, the attacker can also show that his watermarkis present in the watermarked original, as well as inthe original41Hence it is not possible to resolve rightful ownership sinceall claims from both parties are legally speaking equivalent.Some watermarking techniques are inherently invertibleand the question is how to make them noninvertible orhow to avoid this problem. Meanwhile, several methodshave been devised to construct noninvertible watermarks92, 110, 128. The general idea in most methods isto make watermarks noninvertible by making them signaldependent, for example, by using oneway hash functions.In this case, it is computationally infeasible for an attackerto create a counterfeit original because it depends onHARTUNG AND KUTTER MULTIMEDIA WATERMARKING TECHNIQUES 1101Fig. 13. Demonstration of the StirMark 2.2 attack.the watermark, which in turn depends on the counterfeitoriginal which is not yet existing.It should also be noted that in applications where theowner of the data is undisputed, like, for example, inlabeling applications where a serial number is embeddedinto different copies of distributed data, the above concernsdo not apply.D. Robustness Test Utilities andWatermarkRemoval SoftwareSimilar to conditional access and copyprevention mechanisms, the existence of watermarking technology and itspotential possibilities have stimulated individuals to comeup with attempts to defeat watermarking. Examples arepublicly available tools to test the robustness of imagewatermarking techniques. Unzign 138 is a utility thatworks for images in JPEG format. In version 1.1, Unzignintroduces pixel jittering in combination with a slight imagetranslation. For many proposed watermarking techniques,the embedded watermarks are efficiently destroyed. However, besides removing the watermark, Unzign version 1.1introduces severe artifacts. An improved version 1.2 hasbeen released. Although the artifacts were decreased, itswatermark destruction capability decreased as well.StirMark 70, 100 is a simple generic tool to test therobustness of image watermarking techniques. It simulatesresampling to emulate a printingscanning procedure andapplies minor geometric distortions stretching, shearing,shifting, and rotation followed by resampling and bilinearor Nyquist interpolation. In addition, small and smoothlydistributed errors are introduced into all sample values.Applying StirMark only once introduces a practicallyunnoticeable quality loss in the image. The author claimsthat his tool removes all current watermarks. Fig. 13demonstrates the affect of the StirMark attack on a testimage containing a grid and a natural image, and itsStirMark 2.2 attacked version. From visual inspection,it can be confirmed that the effect of the attack is notvisually annoying in the image, and is only evident inthe grid. However, this attack is quite successful if thewatermarking method does not account for it 50.X. THE FUTURE OF DIGITAL WATERMARKINGThe interest in watermarking technology is high, bothfrom academia and industry. The interest from academiais reflected in the number of publications on watermarkingand in the fact that conferences on watermarking and datahiding are being held. The interest from industry is evidentin the number of companies in the field that have beenfounded within the past few years.Besides research activities in universities and industry,several international research projects funded by the European Community have the goal to develop practicalwatermarking techniques. TALISMAN 61 ACTS projectAC019, Tracing Authors rights by labeling image servicesand monitoring access network aims to provide European Union service providers with a standard copyrightmechanism to protect digital products against large scalecommercial piracy and illegal copying. The expected outputof TALISMAN is a system for protecting video sequencesthrough labeling and watermarking. OCTALIS 60 ACTSproject P119, Offer of Content through Trusted AccessLinks is the followup project of TALISMAN and OKAPIwith the main goal of integrating a global approach to equitable conditional access and efficient copyright protectionand to demonstrate its validity on large scale trials on theInternet and European Broadcasting Union EBU network.International standardization consortia are also interestedin watermarking techniques. The emerging video compression standard MPEG4 ISOIEC 14 496, for example,provides a framework that allows the easy integrationwith encryption and watermarking. The DVD industrystandard will contain copy control and copy protectionmechanisms that use watermarking to signal the copy statusof multimedia data, like copy once or do not copy flags.Despite the many efforts that are underway to developand establish watermarking technology, watermarking isstill not a fully mature and understood technology, and alot of questions are not answered yet. Also, the theoreticalfundamentals are still weak, and most systems are designedheuristically.Another drawback is that fair comparisons between watermarking systems are difficult 75. As long as methodsand system implementations are not evaluated in a con1102 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 87, NO. 7, JULY 1999sistent manner using sophisticated benchmarking methods,the danger exists that weak and vulnerable systems andde facto standards are produced that result in spectacularfailures and discredit the entire concept.Thus, the expectations into watermarking should be realistic. It should always be kept in mind that every watermarking system involves a tradeoff between robustness,watermark data rate payload, and imperceptibility. Theinvisible 10 000bitperimage watermark that resists allattacks whatsoever is an illusion realistic numbers areapproximately two orders of magnitude lower. Even whendesigned under realistic expectations, watermarks offerrobustness against nonexperts but may still be vulnerableto attacks by experts.Although proof of ownership was the initial thrust forthe technology, it seems that there is a long way togo before watermarking will be accepted as a proof incourt, and it is likely enough that this may never happen.In copyrightrelated applications, watermarking must becombined with other mechanisms like encryption to offerreliable protection.Still, there exist enough applications where watermarkingcan provide working and successful solutions. Specificallyfor audio and video it seems that watermarking technology will become widely deployed. The DVD industrystandard, as an example, will use watermarking for thecopy protection system. Similarly, there exist plans touse watermarking for copy protection for Internet audiodistribution. Broadcast monitoring using watermarking isanother application that will probably widely be deployedfor both audio and video.Whether the development of watermarking technologywill become a success story or not is an interesting yetunclear question. Watermarking technology will evolve,but attacks on watermarks as well. Careful overall systemdesign under realistic expectations is crucial for successfulapplications.XI. CONCLUSIONSIn this overview paper, we reviewed the most importantaspects, design requirements, system issues, and techniquesfor digital watermarking. The historical roots of digitalwatermarking derive mainly from steganography, the art ofdata hiding. Although digital watermarking and steganography are in some sense similar, the main difference lies inthe notion of robustness for digital watermarks. Watermarkrobustness is one of the major design issues, besidesimperceptibility. We have shown that the various digitalwatermarking applications, such as data tracking, data monitoring, and copyright protection, result in correspondingdesign issues and algorithm requirements. Some schemesrequire the original data set in order to recover an embeddedwatermark and others do not. Further, in some publicationsmethods are proposed that allow full watermark extraction,whereas in other publications techniques are presentedwhich only allow verification if a given watermark ispresent in the data under investigation. We have emphasizedthat these two approaches are inherently equivalent in thata watermarkextraction scheme can be transformed into awatermarkverification scheme and vice versa. Althoughoften associated to still images, video, and audio, digitalwatermarking is also applicable to other digital data suchas text, 3D meshes, or face animation parameters. We haveelaborated on numerous watermarking techniques for stillimages, video, audio, text, and other multimedia data. It hasbeen pointed out that a majority of techniques are inherentlysimilar and based on modulation with a PN signal, oftenin combination with masking, for the embedding processand some kind of hypothesis testing using correlation inthe watermark recovery process. Designing watermarking methods does not only have to consider robustnessagainst standard data processing, but also robustness againstmalicious attacks. Several classes of attacks have beenoutlined, and remedies were given to make watermarksattack resistant. As a general statement, it can be saidthat watermarks should be sufficiently overdesigned andcontain enough redundancy to ensure resilience againstattacks. For copyright enforcement, additional aspects haveto be considered. One problem is to prove who firstwatermarked data if several watermarks are present in thedata. Solutions to this problem might consist of digitaltime stamping or watermark registration. Further, it hasbeen shown that robustness is not sufficient to resolverightful ownership, even if the original data are available.In addition, the used watermarking method needs to benoninvertible. Several techniques have been proposed torender invertible methods noninvertible, including hashingand time stamping. Although working systems are alreadyavailable, research in digital watermarking has to continue.There is a huge demand from content providers and IPRowners. The market is currently far from being saturatedand many more companies are expected to be founded inthe near future. The question whether digital watermarkswill be used as legal proof in court is not yet decided anddifficult to answer. There are, however, other applications,like multimedia copy protection systems and data broadcastmonitoring, where we will see watermarking in operation.ACKNOWLEDGMENTThe authors would like to thank Dr. I.
