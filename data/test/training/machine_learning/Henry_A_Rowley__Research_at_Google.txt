Rowley Research Area(s) Algorithms and Theory Data Mining and Modeling Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization Information Retrieval and the Web Machine Intelligence Machine Perception Mobile Systems Co-Authors Chuck Rosenberg Daniel Keysers David Cai Mehryar Mohri Michele Covell Sanjiv Kumar Shumeet Baluja Thomas Deselaers Yi Liu Henry A. Rowley received BS degrees in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Minnesota in 1992, a Masters in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1994, and PhD in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1999 for his thesis work on neural network-based face detection. After graduating he worked at Zaxel Systems, Inc. on lossless video compression and multi-view stereo reconstruction, and at Microsoft on Chinese, Japanese, and Korean handwriting recognition. Currently he is a member of the Google Research group, where he has worked on computer vision, machine learning, and most recently handwriting recognition.
