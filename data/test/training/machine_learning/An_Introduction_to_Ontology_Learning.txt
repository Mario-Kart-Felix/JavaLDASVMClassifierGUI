Ever since the early days of Artificial Intelligence and the development of the first
knowledge-based systems in the 70s [32] people have dreamt of self-learning machines
When knowledge-based systems grew larger and the commercial interest in these tech
nologies increased, people became aware of the knowledge acquisition bottleneck and
the necessity to (partly) automatize the creation and maintenance of knowledge bases
Today, many applications which exhibit ’intelligent’ behavior thanks to symbolic knowl
edge representation and logical inference rely on ontologies and the standards provided
by the World Wide Web Committee (W3C). Supporting the construction of ontologies
and populating them with instantiations of both concepts and relations, commonly re
ferred to as ontology learning
Early research in ontology learning has concentrated on the extraction of facts or
schema-level knowledge from textual resources building upon earlier work in the field
of computational linguistics and lexical acquisition. However, as we will show in this
book, ontology learning is a very diverse and interdisciplinary field of research. Ontol
ogy learning approaches are as heterogeneous as the sources of data on the web, and as
different from one another as the types of knowledge representations called ontologies
In the remainder of this introduction, we briefly summarize the state-of-the-art in
ontology learning and elaborate on what we consider as the key challenges for current
and future ontology learning research
Ontology-based Knowledge Representation
Ontologies in computer science are usually regarded as formal representations of knowl
edge – often restricted to a particular domain. There is, however, no general agreement
on which requirements the formal representation needs to satisfy in order to be appro
priately be called an ontology. Depending on the particular point of view, ontologies can
be simple dictionaries, taxonomies, thesauri, or richly axiomatized top-level formalisa
tions. In this book, we do not limit ourselves to a particular definition of the term on
tology, since use case specific requirements determine the needed expressivity of knowl
edge bases: the contributions range from approaches to learning lightweight structures to
methods for generating complex definitions of classes
Ontologies play a central role in data and knowledge integration. By providing a
shared schema, they facilitate query answering and reasoning over disparate data sources

Since the amount of data on the web as well as in corporate intranets, for example, is
growing quickly, structured access to data becomes more important. In addition to data
integration, reasoning and querying scenarios, ontologies are also a means to document
the structure of a particular domain, which helps to develop a common understanding of
its concepts
However, the construction of ontologies is a highly expensive task which crucially
hinges on the availability of scarce expert resources [39]. In order to build a formal on
tology for a particular domain of interest, for instance, specialized domain knowledge
needs to be acquired and formalized in a way that automated inference will yield the ex
pected results. This goal can only be achieved if domain experts collaborate with skilled
ontology engineers familiar with the theory and practice of knowledge representation
– and once the ontology has been constructed, evolving knowledge and application re
quirements will demand for continuous maintenance efforts
Ontology Learning
It is more than ten years now that Mädche and Staab [29] coined the term ontology
learning” for a newly emerging field of research aiming at nothing less than the automatic
generation of ontologies. The first ontology learning workshop2, held in 2000 and co
organized by Claire Nédellec and Peter Wiemer-Hastings, brought together people from
very different research communities. Looking into the proceedings, we can distinguish
works based on ripple down rules, word sense clustering, and information extraction, for
example. It is remarkable that there were only few contributions from the field of concept
learning at that time, although researchers have investigated the use of inductive logic
programming for learning logical theories since the mid 80s. From today’s perspective
ontology learning is a use case for concept learning, but the collaboration and exchange
between this and other parts of the ontology learning community is still limited. Ten
years after the first ontology learning workshop, we tried to compile a book which brings
together the most diverse works in the area of ontology learning including contributions
by the concept learning community as well as “classical” works on ontology learning
from text or other semi-structured resources. It is designed to give an overview of a broad
range of ontology learning approaches, logical and statistical ones, and to outline the
synergies that may arise from bringing together the various methods and methodologies
While we do not intend to draw a sharp line between different types of ontology
learning, approaches can be roughly classified into the following areas
Ontology Learning from Text mostly focuses on the automatic or semi-automatic gen
eration of lightweight taxonomies by means of text mining and information ex
traction. Many of the methods used in ontology learning from text (e.g. lexico
syntactic patterns for hyponymy detection or named-entity classification) are in
spired by previous work in the field of computational linguistics, essentially de
signed in order to facilitate the acquisition of lexical information from corpora
Some ontology learning approaches do not derive schematic structures, but focus
on the data level. Such ontology population methods derive facts from text. A pop
ular example is the Never-Ending Language Learning (NELL) project [10], which
reads the web to add statements to its knowledge base and improves its perfor
mance over time, e.g. via user feedback

Linked Data Mining refers to the process of detecting meaningful patterns in RDF
graphs. One of the motivations behind this research area is that Linked Data pub
lishers sometimes do not create an explicit schema for their dataset upfront, but
focus on publishing data first. Being able to detect the structure within published
RDF graphs can, on the one hand, simplify the later creation of schemata and, on
the other hand, allow to detect interesting associations between elements in the
RDF graph. This can be achieved via statistical schema induction [7,8,43] or sta
tistical relational learning methods, which mine frequent patterns and correlations
in large data sets. In Linked Data mining, clustering approaches can be used to
group related resources and provide an enhanced structure for the underlying data
Concept Learning in Description Logics and OWL is a direction of research that
aims at learning schema axioms, such as definitions of classes, from existing on
tologies and instance data. Most methods in this area are based on Inductive Logic
Programming methods [33]. While many algorithms, such as DL-FOIL [16] and
OCEL [25] are generic supervised machine learning approaches for description
logics, there are also specific adaptations to ontology learning [22], e.g., in terms
of performance and usability. Closely related to concept learning in Description
Logics is onto-relational learning, which combines methods for learning OWL
axioms with rule learning approaches
Crowdsourcing ontologies is an interesting alternative to purely automatic approaches
as it combines the speed of computers with the accuracy of humans. Provided that
the task to be completed is simple enough, it only requires the right incentives for
people to contribute. Examples of crowdsourcing in the field of ontology learning
include taxonomy construction via Amazon mechanical turk, and games with a
purpose for ontology population (see, e.g.,
Other approaches include, e.g., transfer learning and ontology re-use, which try to
adapt existing ontologies to new domains by partially re-using existing schematic struc
tures. Furthermore, apart from the above mentioned combination of rules and ontologies
direct representations of uncertainty, e.g. via Markov Logic Networks, are also investi
gated
Major and minor distinctions between these approaches make it difficult to come up
with a formal definition [41], or a breakdown into concrete subtasks (see, e.g., the ontol
ogy learning layer cake [35]) which is neither too general nor limited to one particular
type of approach [15,29,45]. However, it is this variety that makes the ontology learning
community so rich and inspiring. A lot of progress has been made in each of the above
mentioned fields, and we can observe a trend towards hybrid and integrated approaches
For this book, we assembled contributions by researchers addressing some of the key
challenges in ontology learning
Heterogeneity. Data on the web differs largely, e.g., with respect to formats, lan
guages, domains and quality.3 Approaches to learning from heterogeneous sources of ev
idence [9] can effectively leverage this huge variety by increasing the accuracy as well as
the coverage of learned ontologies. However, neither the integration of methods nor the
homogenization of data has attracted high attention within the ontology learning commu

learning approaches

nity so far and remains to be a challenge for the application of ontology learning methods
in practice
Uncertainty. Low-quality or unstructured data, which is hard to interpret by computa
tional means, as well as inherently imperfect methods for learning ontologies can lead
to results that are less likely to be correct. Thus, many ontology learning methods are
designed in a way that they associate each individual outcome with a certainty value
reflecting the methods’ confidence with regard to the correctness of particular results
Uncertainty values and other types of provenance information such as timestamps or
authorship annotations are especially important when it comes to manual or automatic
debugging of learned ontologies
Reasoning. Often, ontologies are learned or manually created for applications which
are based on logical inference. In case these applications require the ontology to be logi
cally consistent, ontology learning approaches should be capable of generating consistent
(and coherent) ontologies. Therefore, not only methods for concept learning in descrip
tion logics, but also other ontology learning approaches rely on logical reasoning. Exper
iments have shown that a tight coupling between ontology debugging, i.e. inconsistency
diagnosis and repair, and ontology learning may be beneficial
Scalability. Extracting knowledge from the growing amounts of data on the web – un
structured, textual data on the one hand and structured data such as databases, linked
data4 or ontologies on the other hand – requires scalable and efficient approaches. Es
pecially when it comes to learning from distributed, loosely interconnected data and
the integration of knowledge from multiple sources, ontology learning methods face big
challenges. In order to address these challenges, various strategies are currently being
developed, such as distributed computation for horizontally scaling ontology learning
incremental learning approaches for re-using existing knowledge, or sampling [17] and
modularization to improve the efficiency of ontology learning algorithms
Quality. We can measure the quality of an automatically generated ontology as we can
measure the quality of any ontology, be it learned or manually engineered. However, on
tology evaluation is not an easy task (see [44] for a comprehensive overview of the state
of-the-art in ontology evaluation). Formal correctness, completeness and consistency are
only a few of many possible criteria for judging the quality of an ontology, and it is the
application context of an ontology which ultimately determines the choice of evaluation
criteria as well as the required quality standard. Ideally, each step of an ontology learning
process, including the choice of input data as well as preprocessing and relation extrac
tion, for example, should thus be optimized with regard to the particular domain or ap
plication context that the learned ontology will be used for. Ontology learning method
ologies [40] and the adoption of ontology design patterns [4] can help to further improve
the results
Interactivity. In practice, the quality of a learned ontology often depends on the degree
of automation. The lesser the extent to which humans are involved in a semiautomatic
ontology generation process, the lower the quality we can expect. An ontology insuffi
cient for the intended application in terms of quality, e.g., after having been generated
in a fully automatic way, will eventually require a significant amount of postprocessing

Lehmann and Völker / An Introduction to Ontology Learning xiii
While the revision of learned ontologies is not generally considered part of the actual on
tology learning process, methods for automatic ontology generation can support this sort
of post-processing by providing detailed provenance information. Provenance informa
tion acquired in the course of ontology learning typically comprises, for example, con
fidence and relevance values for individual axioms as well as time stamps and key facts
about the employed learning procedure. Nevertheless, the amount of post-processing can
be a significant burden for knowledge engineers, and innovative methods are required
in order to overcome the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck. Generally, it is ad
visable to integrate methods for ontology learning and revision into popular ontology
engineering frameworks, in order to reduce the overhead for human participation in the
overall process [22,37]. Crowdsourcing and games with a purpose can help to lower the
costs of revising learned ontologies by involving non-experts, but translating their in
teractions into ontology modeling decisions is a non-trivial problem. Systematic expert
interrogation, known as relational exploration, has been found to be an efficient way of
asking people the right questions, while at the same time reducing the overall number
of decisions to be made [2]. Finally, experiments have shown that ontology design pat
terns, which capture the knowledge and experience of human ontology engineers, can
beneficially be integrated into the ontology learning process
About this Book
In the following, we describe the structure of the book and give an outline of the content
of individual chapters
Foundations This part of the book covers the most basic concepts which are important
to understand state-of-the-art ontology learning approaches. First, Krötzsch et al.
give a primer on description logics, the family of knowledge representation formalisms
which underly most of the learned ontologies. The second chapter contributed by
Jentzsch, Vrandečić and Usbeck [18] introduces RDF and the Linked Data principles as
well as fundamental semantic web technologies such as SPARQL, for example. It is fol
lowed by an overview of typical machine learning approaches which are applied in on
tology learning (see Ławrynowicz and Tresp [21]). Finally, as the vast majority of ontol
ogy learning algorithms still relies on textual input, Maynard and Bontcheva [30] cover
the most relevant natural language processing techniques
Logical Learning The second part of this book focuses on approaches which have been
developed to derive ontologies from structured knowledge. Logical learning methods are
introduced by Lehmann et al. [24], who cover the foundations of learning description
logic concepts, as well as by Francesca Lisi [26] who contributed a chapter on learning
onto-relational rules. The presented methods are based on the assumption that schema
axioms, such as concept definitions, can be learned from existing instance level knowl
edge
Lexical Learning Given the vast amounts of textual contents on the web it is not aston
ishing that previous research in ontology learning mainly concentrated on the acquisition
of ontologies from unstructured data. In this part of the book, we therefore present con
tributions to ontology learning from natural language text based on information extrac
tion and text mining techniques. The first chapter (cf. Coppola et al. [13]) introduces a
methodology for generating domain-specific ontologies by specializing and instantiating
xiv Lehmann and Völker / An Introduction to Ontology Learning
frames from the FrameNet lexicon. In the second chapter, Fabian Suchanek [42] gives
an overview of well-known methods for acquiring facts and taxonomies from Wikipedia
articles, while putting an emphasis on the synergies between ontological reasoning and
information extraction. Finally, the chapter contributed by Nováček and Handschuh
outlines a layered ontology learning framework, which facilitates the integration of facts
extracted from textual documents with existing schema-level knowledge
Learning from Web Data The increasing amounts of data available through the web
and the growing need for automatic approaches to the access and usage of information
on the web, pose particular challenges to ontology learning methods. This part of the
book is therefore dedicated to methods which take into account the specific characteris
tics of web data, such as heterogeneity, volume, decentralization and a large variety of
different formats. A part of the world wide web, which has seen a tremendous rise in
importance over the past decade, are social websites and crowdsourced tagging applica
tions. The first chapter in this part of the book gives a systematic overview over the trends
and future developments in the area of knowledge extraction from tagging systems or
folksonomies (see Benz and Hotho [3]). Spatial applications and annotations of points
of interests are investigated by Alves and Pereira [1] in the second chapter, which deals
with approaches to semantically enrich the descriptions of spatial objects. Finally, in the
last chapter in this part, Cerbah and Lammari [11] address the problem of web applica
tion backends. Motivated by the fact that the vast majority of web applications are driven
by relational databases, they present methods for deriving ontologies from schemata of
relational databases
Dynamics and User Interaction In many cases, purely automatic learning approaches
will fail to generate ontologies which are good enough for a particular, e.g. reasoning
based, application. For this reason, we would like to emphasize the role users and knowl
edge engineers can play in an ontology learning process. The first chapter of this part
written by Simperl et al. [38] explains how games with a purpose can help to leverage
human resources for learning ontologies. A completely different approach to “putting the
human in the loop” is presented by Rudolph and Sertkaya [36], who introduce formal
concept analysis as a means to interactive ontology learning and as an effective way to
minimize the required human effort. Last, but not least, Blomqvist et al. [6] elaborate
on key challenges in ontology learning and how those can be addressed by the use of
ontology design patterns, which encode best-practices in ontology engineering
