CiteScore values are based on citation counts in a given year (e.g. 2015) to documents published in three previous calendar years (e.g. 2012 – 14), divided by the number of documents in these three previous years (e.g. 2012 – 14). More about CiteScore Impact Factor: 1.084 ℹ Impact Factor: 2015: 1.084 The Impact Factor measures the average number of citations received in a particular year by papers published in the journal during the two preceding years. © Thomson Reuters Journal Citation Reports 2016 5-Year Impact Factor: 1.103 ℹ Five-Year Impact Factor: 2015: 1.103 To calculate the five year Impact Factor, citations are counted in 2015 to the previous five years and divided by the source items published in the previous five years. © Journal Citation Reports 2016, Published by Thomson Reuters Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP): 1.164 ℹ Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP): 2015: 1.164 SNIP measures contextual citation impact by weighting citations based on the total number of citations in a subject field. SCImago Journal Rank (SJR): 0.565 ℹ SCImago Journal Rank (SJR): 2015: 0.565 SJR is a prestige metric based on the idea that not all citations are the same. SJR uses a similar algorithm as the Google page rank; it provides a quantitative and a qualitative measure of the journal’s impact.

Publishing Campus Author Services Special issue on Recent Advances in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Paradigms Aim and Scope: Machine learning, artificial intelligence and its learning, adaption paradigms are providing an effective solution in engineering applications. It encompasses artificial neural network, reasoning, evolutionary algorithms, artificial immune systems, DNA computing, and quantum computing, among others.  These techniques will be more helpful to human intelligence for handling uncertainty and subjective vagueness in decision making process. The new frontier research era development of machine learning and artificial intelligence paradigms with reference to data analytics and optimization has played a significant role in various research streams. Consequently, the fast developments of computer science research have raised the need for in-depth convergence of machine learning and artificial intelligence computing paradigms. Moreover, applying machine learning and artificial intelligence system for data analytics and engineering applications is feasible and sound. The aim of this special issue is to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence computing paradigms, advanced data analytics, and optimization opportunities to bring more awareness on applicability and usefulness of various engineering applications. Further, it is imperative to note that machine learning and artificial intelligence computing paradigms and its prediction, optimization techniques has not been adequately investigated from the perspective of bio-medical engineering and its related research issues. Furthermore, there are many intertwined noteworthy issues (bio-medicine composition, medical imaging modalities, biologically inspired learning and adaption in self-configuration of network services etc) that need to be addressed in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence system. Obviously, these challenges are creating immense opportunities for researchers. Hence, primary aim of this special issue is to disseminate the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches/models and its related branches such as evolutionary computation, neural networks, artificial immune systems, swarm intelligence, and so on for various engineering systems. We cordially invite investigators to contribute their original research articles, with an emphasis on real-life applications, as well as review articles that will stimulate further activities in this area and improve our understanding of the key scientific problems.
