This is important for efficiency, and increasingly for suitability for systems that continuously interact with their environment. The well studied Perceptron algorithm is a classical example of an on-line learning algorithm, where SVM is the corresponding batch algorithm. Our work investigates on-line learning algorithms and their theoretical and empirical generalization performance. We have also investigated developing kernels for complex structured data and using these with on-line and batch algorithms. This work is partly supported by NSF grants IIS-0803409 and IIS-0099446.
