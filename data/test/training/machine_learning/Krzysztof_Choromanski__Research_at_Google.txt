Yu Sanjiv Kumar Tamas Sarlos Umar Syed Vikas Sindhwani Krzysztof Choromanski works on several aspects of machine learning and robotics. His current research includes model predictive control, dynamical systems, reinforcement learning, online algorithms and structured nonlinear embeddings. He was also working on online nonparametric clustering for massive high-dimensional streams. Krzysztof is an author of several nonlinear embeddings mechanisms based on structured matrices that can be used to speed up: neural network computations, kernels approximations via random feature maps, convex optimization solvers, quantization and soft clustering methods as well as several LSH-based algorithms. With his background in structured graph theory, he is also interested in applying graph theory and other combinatorial methods in machine learning.
