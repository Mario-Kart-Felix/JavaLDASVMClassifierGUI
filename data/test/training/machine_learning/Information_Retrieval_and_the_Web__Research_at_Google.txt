Google started as a result of our founders' attempt to find the best matching between the user queries and Web documents, and do it really fast. During the process, they uncovered a few basic principles: 1) best pages tend to be those linked to the most; 2) best description of a page is often derived from the anchor text associated with the links to a page. Theories were developed to exploit these principles to optimize the task of retrieving the best documents for a user query. Search and Information Retrieval on the Web has advanced significantly from those early days: 1) the notion of "information" has greatly expanded from documents to much richer representations such as images, videos, etc., 2) users are increasingly searching on their Mobile devices with very different interaction characteristics from search on the Desktops; 3) users are increasingly looking for direct information, such as answers to a question, or seeking to complete tasks, such as appointment booking. In Research at Google, we are continuing to enhance and refine the world's foremost search engine by aiming to scientifically understand the implications of those changes and address new challenges brought out by them. 203 Publications       Learning from User Interactions in Personal Search via Attribute Parameterization Don Metzler , Marc Najork , Mike Bendersky , Xuanhui Wang ACM (2017), pp. 791-800       Related Event Discovery Cheng Li, Mike Bendersky , Sujith Ravi , Vijay Garg Proceedings of WSDM (2017) (to appear)       Beyond Corp: The Access Proxy Batz Spear, Betsy (Adrienne Elizabeth) Beyer , Luca Cittadini, Max Saltonstall Login (2016)       Improving topic clustering on search queries with word co-occurrence and bipartite graph co-clustering Jing Kong , Alex Scott , Georg M.
