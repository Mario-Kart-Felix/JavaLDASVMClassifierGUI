Emotions or sentiments are one of the most important aspects as the user-generated data are always with emotional loads of their creators. Along with the development of the computational techniques for sentiment analysis and opinion mining, the increasing psychological and cognitive models/theories are exploited for modeling sentiments and emotions by incorporating with social computing techniques such as social network and personalization, mining user reviews, user profiling in social network and so on. Connecting affective/sentimental models and social computing techniques not only can facilitate the understanding big data in at semantic-levels but also improve the performance of various social computing applications in the big data era. It combines affective/sentimental models with social computing as a promising direction and offers opportunities for developing novel algorithms, methods and tools. This special issue aims to capture the recent progresses by the academia, researchers, and industrial practitioners from computer science, information systems, psychology, behavior science, and organization science discipline, and provide a forum for recent advances in the field of sentiment analysis, affective computing, emotion detections, and opinion mining from the perspectives of various computing techniques. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the exploitation of the affective/sentimental models from psychology and cognitive sciences for big data, the identification of emotions/sentiments underlying big data for efficient algorithms for big data management, and the application of affective/sentimental models with social computing techniques in research fields related to (but not limited): - Sentiment identification & classification - Emotion identification & classification - Opinion and sentiment summarization - Sentiment analysis for social media - Affective computing for social media - Time evolving sentiment & emotion analysis - Knowledge management for affective computing - Concept-level sentiment analysis - Social media and social network analysis - Affective/Sentimental computing for e-learning - Affective/Sentimental computing for financial data mining - Affective/Sentimental computing for e-commerce - Natural language processing techniques for affective computing - Social ranking - Social network analysis - Social tagging analysis - Affective/Sentimental computing for user modeling - Data mining algorithms for affective computing - Big social data analysis - Information fusion for affective computing Paper Submission Authors should follow the instructions given at the International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics website: http://www.springer.com/engineering/computational+intelligence+and+complexity/journal/13042 Important Date April 1, 2017: Due date for full papers submission (extended) June 1, 2017: Notification of paper to authors (extended) July 1, 2017: 1st paper revision due (extended) August 1, 2017: Notification of acceptance (extended) Guest Editors Haoran Xie, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Tak-Lam Wong, The Education University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Fu Lee Wang, Caritas Institute of Higher Education, Hong Kong Raymond Wong, University of New South Wales, Australia Xiaohui Tao, University of Southern Queensland, Australia Ran Wang, Shenzhen University, China Related Resources ECML-PKDD 2017    European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery DSAA 2017    The 4th IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics 2017 ASC 2017    The International Workshop on Affective and Sentimental Computing ICONIP 2017    International Conference on Neural Information Processing SI-SoftMM 2017    Special Issue on Soft Computing Techniques and Applications on MM Data Analyzing Systems-- Springer Journal of Multimedia Tools and Applications SI BWild 2017    Image and Vision Computing (IVC) Special Issue on Biometrics in the Wild ACII 2017    Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction ACML 2017    The 9th Asian Conference on Machine Learning ICANN 2017    International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks 2017 ICMLA 2017    16th IEEE International Conference On Machine Learning And Applications About Us | Contact Us | Data | Privacy Policy | Terms and Conditions This wiki is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License .
