However, questions in practice are rarely so clean as to just to use an out of the box algorithm. A big challenge is in developing metrics, designing experimental methodologies, and modeling the space to create parsimonious representations that capture the fundamentals of the problem. These problems cut across Googleâ€™s products and services, from designing experiments for testing new auction algorithms; to developing automated metrics to measure the quality of a road map. Data mining lies at the heart of many of these questions, and the research done at Google is at the forefront of the field. Whether it is finding more efficient algorithms for working with massive data sets, developing privacy-preserving methods for classification, or designing new machine learning approaches, our group continues to push the boundary of what is possible. 189 Publications       Related Event Discovery Cheng Li, Mike Bendersky , Sujith Ravi , Vijay Garg Proceedings of WSDM (2017) (to appear)       A New Approach to Optimal Code Formatting Phillip Yelland Google, Inc.
