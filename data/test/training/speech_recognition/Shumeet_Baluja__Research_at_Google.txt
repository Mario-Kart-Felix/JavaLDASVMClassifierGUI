Sivakumar David Minnen Deepak Ravichandran George Toderici Henry A. Rowley Jay Yagnik Maryam Kamvar Michael Fink Michele Covell Rahul Sukthankar Shankar Kumar Shumeet Baluja, Ph.D., is currently a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Google, where he works on a broad set of topics ranging from image processing and machine learning to wireless application development and user interaction measurement. He is the author of the forthcoming book The Silicon Jungle: A Novel of Deception, Power, and Internet Intrigue. Shumeet was formerly the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of JAMDAT Mobile, Inc., where he oversaw all aspects of technology initiation, development and deployment. Previously, Shumeet was Chief Scientist at Lycos Inc., where he led the Research and Applied Technology Group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis of user behavior, including data mining and trend analysis, advertisement optimization, and statistical modeling of traffic and site interactions. As Senior Vice President of R&D at eCompanies LLC, he spearheaded the creation of their wireless practice and was responsible for finding and evaluating new technologies and technology entrepreneurs. Shumeet has filed numerous patents and has published scientific papers in fields including computer vision and facial image processing, advertisement display and optimization, automated vehicle control, statistical machine learning, and high-dimensional optimization. Shumeet graduated from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor of Science, with high distinction, in 1991. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in 1996.
