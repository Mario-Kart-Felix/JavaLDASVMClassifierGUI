Attempting to improvethe performance of individual matchers in such situations may not prove to be effective because of these inherentproblems. Multibiometric systems seek to alleviate some of these drawbacks by providing multiple evidences of thesame identity. These systems help achieve an increase in performance that may not be possible using a single biometricindicator. Further, multibiometric systems provide antispoofing measures by making it difficult for an intruder tospoof multiple biometric traits simultaneously. However, an effective fusion scheme is necessary to combine the information presented by multiple domain experts. This paper addresses the problem of information fusion in biometricverification systems by combining information at the matching score level. Experimental results on combining threebiometric modalities face, fingerprint and hand geometry are presented. 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Credit card fraud for example,costs the industry millions of dollars annually,primarily due to the lack of effective customerverification techniques Wallich, 1999.Traditionally, passwords knowledgebased security and ID cards tokenbased security havebeen used to restrict access to applications. However, security can be easily breached in these applications when a password is divulged to anunauthorized user or a badge is stolen by an impostor. The emergence of biometrics has addressedthe problems that plague traditional verificationmethods. Biometrics refers to the automatic identification or verification of an individual or aclaimed identity by using certain physiological orights reserved.2116 A. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125behavioral traits associated with the person Fig.1. Biometric systems make use of fingerprints,hand geometry, iris, retina, face, hand vein, facialthermograms, signature or voiceprint to verify apersons identity Jain et al., 1999a. They have anedge over traditional security methods in that theycannot be easily stolen or shared.A simple biometric system has a sensor module,a feature extraction module and a matching module. The performance of a biometric system islargely affected by the reliability of the sensor usedand the degrees of freedom offered by the featuresextracted from the sensed signal. Further, if thebiometric trait being sensed or measured is noisya fingerprint with a scar or a voice altered by acold, for example, the resultant matching scoreFig. 1. Examples of some of the biometric traits associated withan individual a fingerprint, b face, c hand geometry, dsignature, e iris and f voice.computed by the matching module may not bereliable. Simply put, the matching score generatedby a noisy input has a large variance. This problemcan be addressed by installing multiple sensorsthat capture different biometric traits. Such systems, known as multimodal biometric systemsHong et al., 1999, are expected to be more reliable due to the presence of multiple pieces of evidence. These systems are also able to meet thestringent performance requirements imposed byvarious applications Hong and Jain, 1998. Multimodal systems address the problem of nonuniversality it is possible for a subset of users to notpossess a particular biometric. For example, thefeature extraction module of a fingerprint authentication system may be unable to extract featuresfrom fingerprints associated with specific individuals, due to the poor quality of the ridges. In suchinstances, it is useful to acquire multiple biometrictraits for verifying the identity. Multimodal systems also provide antispoofing measures bymaking it difficult for an intruder to spoof multiplebiometric traits simultaneously. By asking the userto present a random subset of biometric traits, thesystem ensures that a live user is indeed present atthe point of acquisition. However, an integrationscheme is required to fuse the information presented by the individual modalities.In this paper we deal with the problem of information fusion by first building a multimodalbiometric system and then devising variousschemes to integrate these modalities. The proposed system uses the fingerprint, face, and handgeometry features of an individual for verificationpurposes.2. A biometric systemA biometricbased authentication system operates in two modes1 Enrollment mode In the enrollment mode ausers biometric data is acquired using a biometric reader and stored in a database. Thestored template is labeled with a user identitye.g., name, identification number, etc. to facilitate authentication.A. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125 21172 Authentication mode In the authenticationmode, a users biometric data is once again acquired and the system uses this to either identify who the user is, or verify the claimedidentity of the user. While identification involves comparing the acquired biometric information against templates corresponding to allusers in the database, verification involves comparison with only those templates corresponding to the claimed identity. Thus, identificationand verification are two distinct problems having their own inherent complexities.A simple biometric system has four importantcomponents1 Sensor module which acquires the biometricdata of an individual. An example is a fingerprint sensor that captures fingerprint impressions of a user.2 Feature extraction module in which the acquired data is processed to extract featurevalues. For example, the position and orientation of minutiae points in a fingerprint imagewould be extracted in the feature extractionmodule of a fingerprint system.3 Matching module in which the feature valuesare compared against those in the templateby generating a matching score. For example,in this module, the number of matching minutiae points between the query and the templatewill be computed and treated as a matchingscore.4 Decisionmaking module in which the usersidentity is established or a claimed identity iseither accepted or rejected based on the matching score generated in the matching module.The performance of a biometric system can bemeasured by reporting its false accept rate FARand false reject rate FRR at various thresholds.These two factors are brought together in a receiver operating characteristic ROC curve thatplots the FRR against the FAR at differentthresholds. Alternately, the genuine accept rate,which equals 1FRR, may be plotted against theFAR. The FAR and FRR are computed bygenerating all possible genuine and impostormatching scores and then setting a threshold fordeciding whether to accept or reject a match. Agenuine matching score is obtained when twofeature vectors corresponding to the same individual are compared, and an impostor matchingscore is obtained when feature vectors from twodifferent individuals are compared.3. Fusion in biometricsThe layout of a bimodal system is shown in Fig.2. The purpose of this diagram is to illustrate thevarious levels of fusion for combining two ormore biometric systems. The three possible levelsof fusion are a fusion at the feature extractionlevel, b fusion at the matching score level, cfusion at the decision level.1 Fusion at the feature extraction level The dataobtained from each sensor is used to computea feature vector. As the features extracted fromone biometric trait are independent of thoseextracted from the other, it is reasonable toconcatenate the two vectors into a single newvector. The new feature vector now has a higherdimensionalityandrepresentsapersons identityin a different and hopefully more discriminating hyperspace. Feature reduction techniquesmay be employed to extract useful featuresfrom the larger set of features.2 Fusion at the matching score level Each system provides a matching score indicating theproximity of the feature vector with the template vector. These scores can be combinedto assert the veracity of the claimed identity.Techniques such as logistic regression may beused to combine the scores reported by thetwo sensors. These techniques attempt to minimize the FRR for a given FAR Jain et al.,1999b.3 Fusion at the decision level Each sensor cancapture multiple biometric data and the resulting feature vectors individually classified intothe two classesaccept or reject. A majorityvote scheme, such as that employed in Zuevand Ivanon, 1996 can be used to make thefinal decision.Fig. 2. A bimodal biometric system showing the three levels of fusion FU fusion module, MM matching module, DM decisionmodule.2118 A. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125Fusion in the context of biometrics can take thefollowing forms1 Single biometric multiple representation.2 Single biometric multiple matchers.3 Multiple biometric fusion.3.1. Single biometric multiple representationThis type of fusion involves using multiplerepresentations on a single biometric indicator.Typically, each representation has its own classifier. The similarity scores reported by these classifiers are then consolidated. Cappelli et al. 2000describe a fingerprint classification system 1 that1 The system classifies a fingerprint into one of five classesArch, Left loop, Right loop, Whorl and Tented arch. Thus it isnot a biometric system by itself, as it does not perform personidentification or verification.combines a structural classifier with a KL transformbased classifier by integrating the scoresgenerated by the two classifiers. This is done byfirst mapping the scores which are distance measures into a common domain via a double sigmoid function and then taking a weighted averagein the new domain. Jain et al. 1999c also usemultiple classifiers for fingerprint indexing. Theirtechnique uses a K nearest neighbor classifier and aset of 10 neural network classifiers to classify fingerprints. General strategies for combining multiple classifiers have been suggested in Ho et al.,1994. All the approaches presented there thehighest rank method, the Borda count method andlogistic regression attempt to reduce or rerank agiven set of classes. These techniques are thusrelevant to the identification problem in which alarge number of classes identities are present.The fusion in this approach takes place at thematching stage, after the classifiers report a similarity score for each class. Prabhakar and JainA. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125 21192002 show that selecting classifiers based onsome goodness statistic may be necessary toavoid performance degradation when using classifier combination techniques. It should also bepossible to combine concatenate the featurevectors extracted by the individual classifiers.3.2. Single biometric multiple matchersIt is also possible to incorporate multiplematching strategies in the matching module of abiometric system and combine the scores generated by these strategies. Jain et al. 1999b use thelogistic function to map the matching scoresobtained from two different fingerprint matchingalgorithms into a single score. The authors demonstrate that such an integration strategy improvesthe overall performance of a fingerprint verification system.This type of fusion also takes place at thematching stage of a biometric system. Althoughthere are multiple matchers in this case, allmatchers operate on the same representation ofthe biometric data.3.3. Multiple biometric fusionMultibiometric fusion refers to the fusion ofmultiple biometric indicators. Such systems seek toimprove the speed and reliability accuracy of abiometric system Hong and Jain, 1998 by integrating matching scores obtained from multiplebiometric sources. A variety of fusion schemeshave been described in the literature to combinethese various scores. These include majority voting, sum and product rules, kNN classifiers,SVMs, decision trees, Bayesian methods, etc. seefor example BenYacoub et al., 1999 Bigun et al.,1997 Dieckmann et al., 1997 Jain et al., 1999dKittler et al., 1998 Verlinde and Cholet, 1999.An important aspect that has to be addressed infusion at the matching score level is the normalization of the scores obtained from the differentdomain experts Brunelli and Falavigna, 1995.Normalization typically involves mapping thescores obtained from multiple domains into acommon domain before combining them. Thiscould be viewed as a twostep process in which thedistributions of scores for each domain is firstestimated using robust statistical techniquesHampel et al., 1986 and these distributions arethen scaled or translated into a common domain.Besides the techniques described above, othertypes of fusion are also possible in biometrics i Afingerprint biometric system may store multipletemplates of a users fingerprint same finger in itsdatabase. When a fingerprint impression is presented to the system for verification, it is comparedagainst each of the templates, and the matchingscore generated by these multiple matchings areintegrated. ii A system may store a single template of a users finger, but acquire multiple impressions of the finger during verification. iiiAnother possibility would be to acquire and useimpressions of multiple fingers for every user.These possibilities have been discussed in Jainet al., 1999e.4. ExperimentsA brief description of the three biometric indicators used in our experiments is given below.4.1. Face verificationFace verification involves extracting a featureset from a twodimensional image of the users faceand matching it with the template stored in thedatabase. The feature extraction process is oftenpreceded by a face detection process during whichthe location and spatial extent of the face is determined within the given image. This is a difficultprocess given the high degree of variability associated with human faces color, texture, expression,pose, etc.. The problem is further compounded bythe presence of complex backgrounds and variablelighting conditions Fig. 3. A variety of techniques have been described in the literature to locate the spatial coordinates of a face within animage Burel and Carel, 1994 Rowley et al., 1998Yang and Huang, 1994. Once the boundary of theface is established, we use the eigenface approachto extract features from the face Kirby and Sirovich, 1990 Turk and Pentland, 1991. In this approach a set of orthonormal vectors or imagesFig. 3. The problem of face detection is compounded by theeffects of complex lighting and cluttered background.2120 A. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125that span a lower dimensional subspace is firstcomputed using the principal component analysisPCA technique. The feature vector of a faceimage is the projection of the original face imageon the reduced eigenspace. Matching involvescomputing the Euclidean distance between theeigenface coefficients of the template and thedetected face.4.2. Fingerprint verificationA fingerprint refers to the flowing pattern ofridges and furrows located on the tip of a finger.Traditionally, these patterns have been extractedby creating an inked impression of the fingertip onpaper. But the electronic era has ushered in a rangeof compact sensors that provide digital images ofthese patterns Fig. 4. In realtime verificationsystems, the images acquired by these sensors areFig. 4. A compact solidstate sensor and a sample fingerprintacquired by the sensor. The sensor is about the size of a postagestamp.used by the feature extraction module to computethe feature values. The feature values typicallycorrespond to the position and orientation ofcertain critical points known as minutiae pointsridge endings and ridge bifurcations that arepresent in every fingerprint Fig. 5. The matchingprocess involves comparing the twodimensionalminutiae patterns extracted from the users printwith those in the template. For this experiment,the techniques described in Jain et al., 1997 wereused in the feature extraction and matching stagesof the fingerprint verification system.4.3. Hand geometryHand geometry, as the name suggests, refers tothe geometric structure of the hand. This structureincludes width of the fingers at various locations,width of the palm, thickness of the palm, length ofthe fingers, etc. Although these metrics do not varysignificantly across the population, they can nevertheless be used to verify the identity of an individual.Hand geometry measurement is nonintrusive andthe verification involves a simple processing of theresulting features. Fig. 6 shows the hand geometrysystem that was used in our experiments. Thesystem computes 14 feature values comprising ofthe lengths of the fingers, widths of the fingers andwidths of the palm at various locations Jain et al.,1999f.Fig. 5.

Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125 21214.4. Combining the three modalitiesThe database for our experiments consisted ofmatching scores obtained from three differentmodalitiesface, fingerprint and hand geometry.However, data pertaining to all three modalitieswere not available for a single set of users. Themutual nondependence of the biometric indicators allows us to assign the biometric data of oneuser to another.The database itself was constructed as followsThe fingerprint and face data were obtained fromuser set I consisting of 50 users. Each user wasasked to provide five face images and five fingerprint impressions of the same finger. This datawas used to generate 500 50  10 genuine scoresand 12,250 50  5  49each feature set of a userwas compared against one feature set each of allother users impostor scores for each modality.The hand geometry data was collected separatelyfrom user set II also consisting of 50 users. 2 Thisresulted in 500 genuine scores and 12,250 impostorscores for this modality also. Each user in set I wasrandomly paired with a user in set II. Thus corresponding genuine and impostor scores for allthree modalities were available for testing. Allscores were mapped to the range 0 100. Since theface and hand scores were not similarity scores2 Some users from set I were present in set II.they were distance scores, they were converted tosimilarity scores by simply subtracting them from100. A similarity score x represents the proximityof two feature sets as computed by a classifier. Ascore vector represents the scores of multiple classifiers. Thus, the vector x1 x2 x3 is a score vector,where x1, x2 and x3 correspond to the similarityscores obtained from the classifiers correspondingto the face, fingerprint and hand geometry systems, respectively.False Accept Rate Fig. 8. ROC curves showing the performance of each of thethree individual modalities.2122 A. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125The scatter plot of the genuine and impostorscores is shown in Fig. 7. The plot indicates thatthe two classes are reasonably separated in threedimensional space therefore, a relatively simpleclassifier should perform well on this dataset. TheROC curves depicting the performance of the individual modalities are shown in Fig. 8.4.4.1. Sum ruleThe simplest form of combination would be totake the weighted average of the scores from themultiple modalities. This strategy was applied toall possible combinations of the three modalities.Equal weights were assigned to each modality as10310210110010110250556065707580859095100Genuine Accept Rate False Accept Rate FaceFingerprintFace  Fingerprint Threshold Genuine FalseAccept Rate  Accept Rate 38 100. 00 11.7541 99.77 4.5442 99.33 2.8343 98.66 1.7544 97.55 0.8045 95.77 0.3146 94.66 0.1247 93.11 0.0149 87.55 0.00Fig. 9.

Figs.9 and 10 show the performance of the sum rule onthe three modalities.4.4.2. Decision treesA decision tree derives a sequence of ifthenelse rules using the training set in order to assign aclass label to the input data. It does this by findingout an attribute feature that maximizes information gain at a particular node. The C5.0 program Quinlan 1992 was used to generate a treefrom the training set of genuine and impostorscore vectors. The training set consisted of 11,125impostor score vectors and 250 genuine score1031021011001011022030405060708090100Genuine Accept Rate False Accept Rate Hand Geometry FaceFace  Hand Geometry Accept Rate  Accept Rate Threshold Genuine False72 100. 00 37.3179 99.33 12.2882 98.00 5.8383 97.55 4.1386 95.33 0.9787 92.66 0.5288 90.88 0.2390 81.77 0.0291 76.22 0.00cores are combined using the sum rule a combining face andFig. 10.

Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125 2123vectors. The test set consisted of the same numberof impostor and genuine score vectors. Crossvalidation was done by considering 10 such partitionsof the training and test sets. Fig. 11 shows theconstruction and performance of the C5.0 decisiontree on one such training and test set.4.4.3. Linear discriminant functionLinear discriminant analysis of the training sethelps in transforming the threedimensional scorevectors into a new subspace that maximizes thebetweenclass separation. Fig. 12 shows the plot ofthe score vectors using the first and the seconddiscriminant variables.The test set vectors are classified by using theminimum Mahalanobis distance rule after firstcalculating the centroids of the two classes in thenew feature space, and then measuring theMahalanobis distance. We assume that the twoclasses have unequal covariance matrices. Table 1shows the confusion matrices resulting from usingthis rule on different partitioning of the data intotraining and test sets.4.4.4. DiscussionThe experiments described above suggest thatthe sum rule performs better than the decision treeand linear discriminant classifiers. The FAR of thetree classifier is 0.036 0.03 and the FRR is9.63 0.03. The FAR of the linear discriminant classifier is 0.47 0.3 and its FRR is0.00. The FRR value in this case is a consequence of overfitting the genuine class as it hasfewer samples in both the test and training sets.The sum rule that combines all three scores has acorresponding FAR of 0.03 and a FRR of 1.78Fig. 11.

Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125suggesting better performance than the other twoclassifiers. It has to be noted that it is not possibleto fix the FRR and then compute the FAR in thecase of the decision tree and linear discriminantclassifiers.5. Conclusion and future workThis paper provides initial results obtained on amultimodal biometric system that uses face, fingerprint and hand geometry features for biometricverification purposes. Our experiments indicatethat the sum rule performs better than the decisiontree and linear discriminant classifiers. The benefitsof multibiometrics may become even more evidentin the case of a larger database of users. We are,therefore, in the process of collecting data corresponding to four biometric indicatorsfingerprint, face, voice and hand geometryfrom alarger user set 100.Future experiments include developing userspecific weights for the individual modalities. Different users tend to adopt differently to individualbiometric indicators. For example, some users mayfind it easier to interact with a fingerprint sensorthan with a hand image sensor. Consequently, theirchances of being rejected by a standalone handgeometry biometric systemmay be high. Therefore,A. Ross, A. Jain  Pattern Recognition Letters 24 2003 21152125 2125it would be appropriate to associate differentweights to the individual modalities based on theusers preference or the systems performance forthat user. These weights can be learnt over time byexamining the stored template of the user, thequery set provided by the user, and the matchingscores for each of the individual modalities. Bydoing so, each user is tightly coupled with thatsubset of biometric traits that distinguishes hervery well from the rest of the users. User specificweights also help address the problem of nonuniversality of biometric traits by giving less weightageto those traits that are not easily extracted. We arealso working on designing techniques to automatically update the biometric templates of a user.ReferencesBenYacoub, S., Abdeljaoued, Y., Mayoraz, E., 1999.
