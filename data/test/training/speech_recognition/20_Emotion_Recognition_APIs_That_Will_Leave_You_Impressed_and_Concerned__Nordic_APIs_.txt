Sound like 1984? The truth is that it’s not that far from reality. Machine emotional intelligence is a burgeoning frontier that could have huge consequences in not only advertising, but in new startups, healthcare, wearables, education, and more. There’s a lot of API-accessible software online that parallels the human ability to discern emotive gestures. These algorithm driven APIs use use facial detection and semantic analysis to interpret mood from photos, videos, text, and speech. Today we explore over 20 emotion recognition APIs and SDKs that can be used in projects to interpret a user’s mood. How Do Emotion Recognition APIs Work? Emotive analytics is an interesting blend of psychology and technology . Though arguably reductive, many facial expression detection tools lump human emotion into 7 main categories: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Contempt, and Disgust. With facial emotion detection , algorithms detect faces within a photo or video, and sense micro expressions by analyzing the relationship between points on the face, based on curated databases compiled in academic environments. To detect emotion in the written word, sentiment analysis processing software can analyze text to conclude if a statement is generally positive or negative based on keywords and their valence index. Lastly, sonic algorithms have been produced that analyze recorded speech for both tone and word content. Use Cases For Emotion Recognition Smile — you’re being watched. The visual detection market is expanding tremendously. It was recently estimated that the global advanced facial recognition market will grow from $2.77 Billion in 2015 to $6.19 Billion in 2020 . Emotion recognition takes mere facial detection/recognition a step further, and its use cases are nearly endless. An obvious use case is within group testing. User response to video games, commercials, or products can all be tested at a larger scale, with large data accumulated automatically, and thus more efficiently. Bentley used facial expression recognition in a marketing campaign to suggest car model types based on emotive responses to certain stimuli . Technology that reveals your feelings has also been suggested to spot struggling students in a classroom environment , or help autistics better interact with others. Some use cases include: Helping to better measure TV ratings . Adding another security layer to security at malls, airports, sports arenas, and other public venues to detect malicious intent. Wearables that help autistics discern emotion Check out counters, virtual shopping Creating new virtual reality experiences Facial Detection APIs that Recognize Mood These computer vision APIs use facial detection, eye tracking, and specific facial position cues to determine a subject’s mood . There are many APIs that scan an image or video to detect faces, but these go the extra mile to spit back an emotive state . This is often a combination of weight assigned to 7 basic emotions, and valence — the subject’s overall sentiment. 1: Emotient Emotient is great for an ad campaign that wants to track attention, engagement, and sentiment from viewers. The RESTful Emotient Web API can be integrated into apps, or used to help power AB testing. In addition to the API, there’s a good account analytics panel. View a demo here . 2: Affectiva With 3,289,274 faces analyzed to date, Affectiva is another solution for massive scale engagement detection. They offer SDKs and APIs for mobile developers, and provide nice visual analytics to track expressions over time. Visit their test demo to graph data points in response to viewing various ads. 3: EmoVu Produced by Eyeris, EmoVu facial detection products incorporate machine learning and micro expression detection that allow an agency to “accurately measure their content’s emotional engagement and effectiveness on their target audience.” With a Desktop SDK, Mobile SDK, and an API for fine grained control, EmoVu offers wide platform support, including many tracking features, like head position, tilt, eye tracking, eye open/close, and more. They offer a free demo with account creation. Looking for APIs?

Though no free demo is offered, Nviso claims to provide a real-time imaging API . They have a reputation, awarded for smarter computing in 2013 by IBM. With its international corporate vibe, Nviso may not be the choice for a developer looking for a quick plug-in-play ability with immediate support. 5: Kairos The Emotion Analysis API by Kairos is a more SaaS-y startup in the facial detection arena. Scalable and on-demand, you send them video, and they send back coordinates that detect smiles, surprise, anger, dislike and drowsiness. They offer a Free Demo (no account setup required) that will analyze and graph your facial responses to a few commercial ads. The sleek-branded Kairos could be a developer favorite. It looks newly supported with a growing community, with transparent documentation for its Face Recognition API , Crowd Analytics SDK , and Reporting API . The  Emotion Analysis API  just recently went live. 6 : Project Oxford by Microsoft Microsoft’s Project Oxford is a catalogue of artificial intelligence APIs focused on computer vision, speech, and language analysis. After the project’s age-guessing tool went viral last year for it’s “incongruities,” some may be reluctant to try Microsoft’s emotion detection capabilities ( this is the app that thought Keanu was only 0.01831 sad ). Nordic APIs founders Travis Spencer and Andreas Krohn – 99% happy The API only works with photos. It detects faces, and responds in JSON with ridiculously specific percentages for each face using the core 7 emotions , and Neutral. Truncate the decimals and this would be a very simple and to the point API, a very useful tool given the right situation. Upload a photo to the free online demo here to test Project Oxford’s computer vision capabilities. 7: Face Reader by Noldus Used in the academic sphere, the Face Reader API by Noldus is based on machine learning, tapping into a database of 10,000 facial expression images. The API uses 500 key facial points to analyze 6 basic facial expressions as well as neutral and contempt. Face Reader also detects gaze direction and head orientation. Noldus seems to have a solid amount of research backing its software. 8: Sightcorp Sightcorp is another facial recognition provider. Their Insight SDK offers wide platform support, and tracks hundreds of facial points, eye gaze, and has been used in creative projects , museum showcases, and at TEDX Amsterdam . Sightcorp’s F.A.C.E. API (still in beta) is an cloud analysis engine for automated emotional expression detection. 9: SkyBiometry SkyBiometry is a cloud-based face detection and recognition tool which allows you detect emotion in photos. Upload a file, and SkyBiometry detects faces, and senses the mood between happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, scared, and neutral, with a percentage rate for each point. It accurately determines if a person is smiling or not. A benefit to Skybiometry is that it’s a spin off of a successful biometric company — so the team’s been around for a while. Check out their free demo to see how it works, and view their extensive online API documentation . 10: Face++ From their developer center, the onboarding process for Face++ looks intuitive. Face++ is more of a face recognition tool that compares faces with stored faces — perfect for name tagging photos in social networks. It makes our list because it does determine if a subject is smiling or not. Face++ has a wide set of developer SDKs in various languages, and an online demo . 11: Imotions Imotions is a biometrics research platform that provides software and hardware for monitoring many types of bodily cues. Imotions syncs with Emotient’s facial expression technology, and adds extra layers to detect confusion and frustration. The Imotions API can monitor video live feeds to extract valence, or can aggregate previously recorded videos to analyze for emotions. Imotion software has been used by Harvard, Procter & Gamble, Yale, the U
