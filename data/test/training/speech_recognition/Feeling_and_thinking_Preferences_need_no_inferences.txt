Feeling and ThinkingPreferences Need No InferencesR. B. ZAJONC University of MichiganABSTRACT Affect is considered by most contemporary theories to be postcognitive, that is, to occur onlyafter considerable cognitive operations have been accomplished. Yet a number of experimental results onpreferences, attitudes, impression formation, and decision making, as well as some clinical phenomena,suggest that affective judgments may be fairly independent of, and precede in time, the sorts of perceptual and cognitive operations commonly assumed to bethe basis of these affective judgments. Affective reactions to stimuli are often the very first reactions ofthe organism, and for lower organisms they are thedominant reactions. Affective reactions can occurwithout extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding,are made with greater confidence than cognitive judgments, and can be made sooner. Experimental evidence is presented demonstrating that reliable affective discriminations likedislike ratings can be madein the total absence of recognition memory oldnewjudgments. Various differences between judgmentsbased on affect and those based on perceptual andcognitive processes are examined. It is concludedthat affect and cognition are under the control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other in a variety of ways, and that bothconstitute independent sources of effects in informationprocessing.The intellectual contact between psychology andpoetry is scarce and, when it takes place, oftentends to be exploitative. If we happen to comeacross a poem that appears to support one of ourfavorite generalizations, we are tempted to citeit not as evidence, of course, but more in theform of a testimonial. Or we might confer uponit the status of an epigraph in one of our forthcoming chapters commonly, to the detriment ofboth the poem and the chapter, But when poetrydisagrees with us we are apt to ignore the conflictaltogether. Nevertheless, this paper begins witha poem by E. E. Cummings 1973, the firststanza of which affirms a premise tacitly rejectedby psychology many decades agoVol. 35, No. 2, 1S117Ssince feeling is firstwho pays any attentionto the syntax of thingswill never wholly kiss you p. 160In it, Cummings takes for granted that feelingsare primary and, by implication, that they arefundamental. They are precedent to the intellective qualities and elements of experience, and theyare nearer to its essence They are nearer to aninner truth.In contrast, contemporary psychology regardsfeelings as last. Affect is postcognitive. It iselicited only after considerable processing of information has been accomplished see Figure 1.An affective reaction, such as liking, disliking, preference, evaluation, or the experience of pleasureor displeasure, is based on a prior cognitive process in which a variety of content discriminationsare made and features are identified, examined fortheir value, and weighted for their contributions.Once this analytic task has been completed, acomputation of the components can generate anoverall affective judgment. Before I can likesomething I must have some knowledge about it,and in the very least, I must have identified someof its discriminant features. Objects must becognized before they can be evaluated,Most of us will not be deeply distressed by discovering that our current theories are in conflictThis article was the Distinguished Scientific ContributionAward address given at the meeting of the AmericanPsychological Association, New York, New York, September 2, 1979.

But contemporary psychology not only contradicts Cummings, it also contradicts one of its very ownfounding fathers. Thirty years before Cummingspublished his poem on feelings, Wundt 1907wrote in a similar veinWhen any physical process rises above the threshold ofconsciousness, it is the affective elements which as soonas they are strong enough, first become noticeable. Theybegin to force themselves energetically into the fixationpoint of consciousness before anything is perceived of theideational elements. . . . They are sometimes states ofpleasurable or unpleasurable character, sometimes theyare predominantly states of strained expectation. . . .Often there is vividly present . . . the special affectivetone of the forgotten idea, although the idea itself stillremains in the background of consciousness. . . . In asimilar manner . . . the clear apperception of ideas inacts of cognition and recognition is always preceded byfeelings, pp. 243244Whatever happened to Wundts affective primacy idea Is there compelling evidence to rejectit  Or to accept it, for that matter Strictlyspeaking, we have no better evidence today thanWundt had in 1896. Perhaps a bit better.In part, my concern in this paper is withWundts assertion. More specifically, building onthe scanty evidence we now have, I have tried todevelop some notions about the possible ways inwhich affect is processed as part of experience andhave attempted to distinguish affect from processing of information that does not have affectivequalities. This article is confined to those aspectsof affect and feeling that are generally involved in1 The italics are mine. The original is even more tothe point. Affective elements were Gefuhlselemente,and the italicized part of the citation was ehe noch vonden Vorstellungselementen irgend etwas wahrgenommcnwird Wundt, 1905, p. 262 .2 It is a fact that only 12 years after the first editionof Wundts Grundriss was published, Nakashima 1909a1909b tested Wundts assertion by collecting reactiontimes of psychophysical pitch, hue, temperature, etc. andaffective preference judgments made on the same setsof stimuli. He did not find shorter reaction times forjudgments of preference than for judgments of pitch, hue,temperature, etc., and thus disagreed with Wundt withregard to the primacy of feelings. But his study alonecould not have buried Wundts idea. Actually, Nakashimas data were rather inconclusive, since he failed tocontrol for levels of discriminability associated with thetwo types of judgments. Thus, for example, subjects candetect very small differences in hue yet feel quite indifferent in their preference for stimuli that differ so little.Since reaction times for comparisons vary with the sizeof the difference, these times can be compared meaningfully only if the stimuli are preselected so that differencethresholds for the two types of judgments are the same.preferences. These aspects are reflected in theanswers to such questions as Do you like thisperson How do you feel about capital punishment Which do you prefer, Brie or Camembert Are you pleased with the review yourrecent book received In short, I deal with somehot cognitions as Abelson 1963 christenedthem and try to distinguish them from the coldones. The class of feelings considered here is thatinvolved in the general quality of behavior thatunderlies the approachavoidance distinction.Thus, for the present purposes, other emotionssuch as surprise, anger, guilt, or shame, whichhave been identified in the literature and extensively analyzed by Tomkins 1962, 1963, Izard1977, and others, are ignored.Unlike experimental psychologists,3 social psychologists are deeply concerned with affect andwith hot cognitions. The extensive work on attitudes, research on cognitive dissonance and cog3 Contemporary cognitive psychology simply ignores affect. The words affect, attitude, emotion, feeling, andsentiment do not appear in the indexes of any of themajor works on cognition Anderson, 1976 Anderson Bower, 1973 Bobrow  Collins, 1975 Crowder, 1976Kintsch, 1974 Lachman, Lachman,  Butterfield, 1979Norman  Rumelhart, 1975 Schank  Abelson, 1977Tulving  Donaldson, 1972. Nor do these conceptsappear in Neissers 1967 original work that gave rise tothe cognitive revolution in experimental psychology. Andin the six volumes and the 2,133 pages of the Handbookof Learning and Cognitive Processes Estes, 19751978,there is only one entry for affect and only one for attitude.It is worth noting that both of these entries are in Volume3 in a contribution written by a social psychologist. Inthe last three volumesthose principally devoted to cognitionthere are no references to affect whatsoever.The notable exceptions are Handlers 1975 work onthought and emotion, Neissers 1976 essay, and Miller andJohnsonLairds 1976 recent volume on language andperception from which the following revealing quotationis takenThe informationprocessing system that emerges fromthese remarks is fearfully cognitive and dispassionate.It can collect information, remember it, and worktoward objectives, but it would have no emotional reaction to what is collected, remembered, or achieved.Since in this respect it is a poor model of a person, weshould add at least one more predicate to this list ofthose that take person as their first argument. Wewill use Feel person, x to indicate that people havefeelings as well as perceptions, memories, and intentions.It might be possible to subsume Feel under Perceive onthe grounds that our feelings are a special class of perception of inner states. Or we might discuss feelingsunder Remember, the recognition that some word orobject is familiar, is after all, a matter of feeling acertain way about it. Or, since we have already jecognized that there is a strong affective component to ourintentions, we might link Feel to Intend. . . .

Typical informationprocessing model of affect.nitive balance, the Schachter and Singer 1962studies on emotion, and Heiders 1958 attemptsto describe the cognitive representation of affectthat characterizes interpersonal relationships areall clear manifestations of this concern.4 Thereare practically no social phenomena that do notimplicate affect in some important way. Affectdominates social interaction, and it is the majorcurrency in which social intercourse is transacted.The vast majority of our daily conversations entailthe exchange of information about our opinions,preferences, and evaluations. And affect in theseconversations is transmitted not only by the verbalchannel but by nonverbal cues as wellcues thatmay, in fact, carry the principal components ofconsiderations testify to the systematic importance ofthis psychological predicate. Nevertheless, we will havelittle to say about Feel in the following pages, pp.111112Thus, Miller and JohnsonLaird explicitly acknowledgethe significance of feelings as part of experience, yet theydecide to devote minimal attention to them. Their decision is noteworthy in the light of their belief that Feelis an indispensable predicate for any complete psychologyand that it probably lies much closer than Perceive, Remember, and Intend to the basic sources of energy thatkeep the whole system running p. 112.Beyond these volumes there are some isolated theoretical attempts directed toward the understanding of therole of motivational and emotional factors in perceptionand cognition Broadbent, 1977 Erdelyt, 1974 Posner Snyder, 197Sa.4 While such studies as those of Byrne 1961, Berscheidand Walster 1978, or Rubin 1973, which deal withinterpersonal attraction, also have a concern withaffect,they do not contain specific analyses of how affect isrepresented as part of experience. And in studies thatcompare the effects of conditions that differ on the affective dimension such as self vs. nonselfrelevance, egoinvolvement, it is generally not the affective quality perse in these conditions that is examined as the major sourceof variation. information about affect. It is much less important for us to know whether someone has just saidYou are a friend or You are a fiend than toknow whether it was spoken in contempt or withaffection. Argyle and his colleagues Argyle, Salter, Nicholson, Williams,  Burgess, 1970 foundthat 22 times more variance is accounted for bythe tone of ones voice than by the content ofthe utterance when people are asked to interpretutterances. In fact, even when the content ofrecorded utterances is nearly completely obliterated by means of electronic masking, filtering, orrandom splicing of the tape, subjects still canencode the emotions expressed in these utterancesquite reliably Dawes  Kramer, 1966 Scherer,Koivumaki,  Rosenthal, 1972. And we have nodifficulty in identifying emotions expressed bymembers of unknown cultures speaking unknownlanguages. In a recent volume on person perception, Schneider, Hastorf, and Ellsworth 1979noted that inferences based on nonverbal cuesare primarily inferences about relationships andfeelings, and thus are among the most importantinferences we make p. 142. One cannot beintroduced to a person without experiencing someimmediate feeling of attraction or repulsion andwithout gauging such feelings on the part of theother. We evaluate each other constantly, weevaluate each others behavior, and we evaluatethe motives and the consequences of their behavior.And you have already made up your mind aboutthis paperNor is the presence of affect confined to socialperception. There are probably very few perceptions and cognitions in everyday life that do nothave a significant affective component, that arenthot, or in the very least tepid, And perhaps allAMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  153perceptions contain some affect. We do not justsee a house we see a handsome house, anugly house, or a pretentious house. We donot just read an article on attitude change, oncognitive dissonance, or on herbicides. We read anexciting article on attitude change, an important article on cognitive dissonance, or a trivialarticle on herbicides. And the same goes for asunset, a lightning flash, a flower, a dimple, ahangnail, a cockroach, the taste of quinine, Saumur, the color of earth in Umbria, the sound oftraffic on 42nd Street, and equally for the soundof a 1000Hz tone and the sight of the letter Q.5Feeling and ThinkingAccording to the prevalent models for affect e.g.,Figure 1, preferences are formed and expressedonly after and only as a result of considerableprior cognitive activity. How fully and completelymust objects be cognized before they can be evaluated I argue, along with Wundt and Cummings,that to arouse affect, objects need to be cognizedvery littlein fact, minimally.In order to consider this possibility more specifically it is important to distinguish betweenthoughts and feelings. At the genotypic level, thisdistinction is not an easy one to make, for ithovers dangerously near the mindbody duality.Some conceptual elements of this distinction, however, may be identified for purposes of clarity.While feelings and thoughts both involve energyand information, the first class of experiences isheavier on energy, whereas the second is heavieron information e.g., Inhelder  Piaget, 1QS8pp. 347348. In the pure case, the analysis offeelings attends primarily to energy transformations, for example, the transformation of chemicalor physical energy at the sensory level into autonomic or motor output. In contrast, the analysisof thoughts focuses principally on informationtransformations. In nearly all cases, however,5 This conjecture probably does not apply to incidentalperceptions where the attentive processes are at minimum,although it is not inconceivable that the traces of theseincidental perceptions still might recruit affect upon retrieval and thus become hot. In fact, Izard 1979 assumes that some emotion is always present in consciousness. Normally, it is the emotion of interest that dominates behavior. This emotion, which directs and sustainsattention and exploration, is absent only when other emotions such as distress or anger achieve consciousnessp. 16S.feeling is not free of thought, nor is thought freeof feelings. Considerable cognitive activity mostoften accompanies affect, and Schachter and Singer1962 consider it a necessary factor of the emotional experience. Thoughts enter feelings at various stages of the affective sequence, and the converse is true for cognitions. Feelings may bearoused at any point of the cognitive processregistration, encoding, retrieval, inference, etc. Butthis converse relation is not totally symmetrical.I will later argue for Wundts conjecture thataffect is always present as a companion to thought,whereas the converse is not true for cognition.In fact, it is entirely possible that the very firststage of the organisms reaction to stimuli and thevery first elements in retrieval are affective. It isfurther possible that we can like something or beafraid of it before we know precisely what it isand perhaps even without knowing what it is.And when we try to recall, recognize, or retrievean episode, a person, a piece of music, a story,a name, in fact, anything at all, the affectivequality of the original input is the first elementto emerge. To be sure, the early affective reactionis gross and vague. Nevertheless, it is capable ofinfluencing the ensuing cognitive process to a significant degree. Needless to say, after some cognitive activity has been executed, there may benew feeling to the stimulus. But the fact thatcognitions can produce feelingsas in listeningto a joke, for example, where affect comes at theend with a punch line or as a result of postdecision dissonanceneed not imply that cognitions are necessary components of affect. What Iwant to argue is that the form of experience thatwe came to call feeling accompanies all cognitions,that it arises early in the process of registrationand retrieval, albeit weakly and vaguely, and thatit derives from a parallel, separate, and partly independent system in the organism.At the phenotypic level, we can support Wundtsconjecture by spelling out in somewhat greaterdetail some of the ways in which affective judgments and reactions, or hot cognitions, differ fromtheir cold cognitive counterparts, keeping in mindthat the first category is represented by the prototype I like Joe, and the second by Joe is aboy.Affective reactions are primary. Wundt andCummings are joined by Bartlett and Osgood inthe view that feelings come first. Bartlett 1932observes in his book on remembering,1S4  FEBRUARY 1Q80  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTAttitude names a complex psychological state or processwhich .it is very hard to describe in more elementarypsychological terms. It is, however, as I have oftenindicated, very largely a matter of feeling, or affect. . . .When a subject is being asked to remember, veryoften the first thing that emerges is something of thenature of attitude. The recall is then a construction,made largely on the basis of this attitude, and its general effect is that of a justification of the attitude, pp.206207In his analysis of environments as perceptualtargets, Ittelson 1973 asserts that the first levelof response to the environment is affective. Thedirect emotional impact of the situation, perhapslargely a global response to the ambiance, verygenerally governs the directions taken by subsequent relations with the environment. It setsthe motivational tone and delimits the kinds ofexperiences one expects and seeks p. 16. Preferences influence language comprehension and language production as well Premack, 1976. Osgood 1962 was impressed with the primacy ofaffect in a different wayFirst, I must confess that, when we began this researchover ten years ago, I had the expectation that the majorfactors of the semantic space would represent the waysin which our sensory apparatus divides up the worlde.g., would parallel Borings dimensions of consciousness.. . . The accumulating data have proved my expectationwrong . . . the dominant factors of evaluation, potencyand activity that keep appearing certainly have a responselike character, reflecting the ways we can react tomeaningful events rather than .the ways we can receivethem.But these major factors also seem to have an affectiveas well as a responselike character. As a matter of fact,the similarity of our factors to Wundts 1896 tridimensional theory o f . jeelingpleasantnessunpleasantness,strainrelaxation, and excitementquiescencehas beenpointed out to me. pp. 1920It is significant also that at least three socialpsychological conceptions labeled cognitive consistency theories focus not on consistency of content but on the consistency of affect Abelson Rosenberg, 1958 Heider, 1958 Osgood  Tannenbaum, 1955.Decisions are another area where thought andaffect stand in tension to each other. It is generally believed that all decisions require someconscious or unconscious processing of pros andcons. Somehow we have come to believe, tautologically, to be sure, that if a decision has beenmade, then a cognitive process must have preceded it. Yet there is no evidence that this isindeed so. In fact, for most decisions, it is extremely difficult to demonstrate that there hasactually been any prior cognitive process whatsoever. One might argue that these are cases inwhich one alternative so overwhelmingly dominatesall the others that only a minimum of cognitiveparticipation is required and that that is why thecognitive involvement preceding such decisions isso hard to detect. But this argument must confront the observation that if all decisions involvethe evaluation of alternatives, then when choicesappear quite lopsided to the decision maker, it iseven more important to scrutinize the alternativesthat appear inferior, for it is entirely possible thatone of them possesses some hidden but overridingvirtue. It is therefore not without merit to suppose that in many decisions affect plays a moreimportant role than we are willing to admit. Wesometimes delude ourselves that we proceed in arational manner and weigh all the pros and consof the various alternatives. But this is probablyseldom the actual case. Quite often I decided infavor of X is no more than I liked X. Mostof the time, information collected about alternatives serves us less for making a decision than forjustifying it afterward. Dissonance is prevalentjust because complete and thorough computationis not performed before the decision Festinger,1964. We buy the cars we like, choose thejobs and houses that we find attractive, andthen justify those choices by various reasons thatmight appear convincing to others who never failto ask us, Why this car or Why this houseWe need not convince ourselves.8 We know whatwe like.In a study of consumer behavior, Quandt1956 found that buyers often do not attend tothe features of the article that they consider criterial for their decisions and often base theirchoices on features that they previously dismissedas irrelevant, And Kahneman and Tversky 1979have demonstrated that numerous axioms of decision theory that give decisions their rationalflavor are blatantly contradicted by experimentalresults.Phoebe Ellsworth Note 1 illustrates the role ofaffect in her own recent decision experience. In tryingto decide whether to accept a position at another university, she says, I get half way through my Irv Janisbalance sheet and say, Oh hell, its not coming out rightHave to find a way to get some pluses over on the otherside AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  155Affect is basic. In one of her last books, whichbears the provocative title of Mind An Essay onHuman Peeling, Susan K. Langer 1967 tried toshow that the entire psychological fieldincluding human conception, responsible action, rationality, knowledgeis a vast and branching development of feeling p. 23. Affect is the first linkin the evolution of complex adaptive functions thateventually differentiated animals from plants. Andunlike language or cognition, affective responsiveness is universal among the animal species. Arabbit confronted by a snake has no time to consider all the perceivable attributes of the snakein the hope that he might be able to infer fromthem the likelihood of the snakes attack, thetiming of the attack, or its direction. The rabbitcannot stop to contemplate the length of thesnakes fangs or the geometry of its markings. Ifthe rabbit is to escape, the action must be undertaken long before the completion of even a simplecognitive processbefore, in fact, the rabbit hasfully established and verified that a nearby movement might reveal a snake in all its coiled glory.The decision to run must be made on the basis ofminimal cognitive engagement.It is thus significant that in categorizing facialexpressions, about 50 of the variance is explained by the pleasantunpleasant dimensionAbelson  Sermat, 1962 Hastorf, Osgood,  Ono,1966, and the same value is obtained for themultidimensional scaling of similarities among photographs of faces Milord, 1978. Similarly, itis a typical result in semantic differential studiesthat among the three factors Evaluation, Potency,and Activity, all of which Osgood considers to beaffective components of meaning, it is the firstthat accounts for about 50 of the variance.7And it is no accident, according to Osgood 1969,that these three factors of the semantic space arefound repeatedly among diverse sets of conceptsIn my opinion, it is the innatcness of the emotional reaction system of the human animal that underlies theuniversality of the affective EPA components of meaning. In other words, the innateness of EPA . . . isreally the panhumanes of emotional reactions, and theseobviously have evolutionary significance for the survivalof any species. Organisms without other specialized adaptive mechanisms e.g., armor, coloration, poisons, etc.which were unable to represent for themselves the goodversus bad implications of things antelope versus sabertoothed tiger, the strong versus weak of things sabertoothed tiger versus mosquito, and the quick versus slowof things sabertoothed tiger versus quicksand wouldhave little chance of survival. In the human speciesthese gut reactions to things appear as the affectivemeaning system the EPA components of total meaning, and it is these components which provide us withwhat might most appropriately be called the feelingtones of concepts as a part of their total meaning, p.195Affective reactions are inescapable. Unlikejudgments of objective stimulus properties, affective reactions that often accompany these judgments cannot always be voluntarily controlled.Most often, these experiences occur whether onewants them to or not. One might be able to control the expression of emotion but not the experience of it itself. It is for this very reason thatlaw, science, sports, education, and other institutions of society keep devising ever new means ofmaking judgments objective. We wish somedecisions to be more independent of these virtuallyinescapable reactions.We may completely fail to notice a personshair color or may hardly remember what it wasshortly after meeting the person. But we canseldom escape the reaction that the person impressed us as pleasant or unpleasant, agreeable ordisagreeable, as someone to whom we were drawnor someone by whom we were repelled. And theseaffective reactionsand, more important, the retrieval of affectoccur without effort. In contrast, some cognitive judgments require substantial effort. Chess contestants typically lose several pounds of their weight in the course of atournament.Because affective judgments are inescapable,they cannot be focused as easily as perceptual andcognitive processes. They are much more influenced by the context of the surround, and theyare generally holistic. Affective reactions are thusless subject to control by attentive processes.87 It is therefore something of a paradox that so littleattention is paid to affect in informationprocessing studies.Most of the tasks in experiments on information processing are verbal. Most of them involve some forms ofsemantic memory. If the semantic space is primarily anaffective space, as Osgood argues, then the affective components and qualities of information need to be given asmuch attention as their phonemic, graphemic, lexical,semantic, conceptual, or pictorial counterparts.8 The existentialists e.g., Sartre, 1947 ascribe a substantial voluntary component to emotion. The existentialist does not believe in the power of passion. He willnever agree that a sweeping passion is a ravaging torrentwhich fatally leads a man to certain acts and is thereforean excuse. He thinks that man is responsible for his passion pp. 2728. Because of the participation of sensory, cognitive, and motor processes, the argument thatemotions have some voluntary component is not withoutbasis.156  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTAffective judgments tend to be irrevocable.Once a cognitive judgment has been madeforexample, that at the forthcoming social hour therewill be more scotches drunk than bourbonsonecan still be persuaded that it may turn out otherwise. It can be pointed out, say, that the distribution of ages of the guests is different thanthat we really like scotch better than bourbon,is greater than the supply of scotch. We canreadily accept the fact that we can be wrong.But we are never wrong about what we like ordislike. Hot cognitions are seldom subjectivelyfalse. It would be much harder to persuade usthat we really like scotch better than bourbon,given that we feel otherwise. Once formed, anevaluation is not readily revoked. Experimentson the perseverance effect, the strong primacyeffects in impression formation, and the fact thatattitudes are virtually impervious to persuasion bycommunication all attest to the robust strengthand permanence of affect. Affect often persistsafter a complete invalidation of its original cognitive basis, as in the case of the perseverancephenomenon when a subject is told that an initialexperience of success or failure has been totallyfabricated by the experimenter Ross, Lepper, Hubbard, 1975.The reason why affective judgments seem soirrevocable is that they feel valid. We are noteasily moved to reverse our impression of a personor of a piece of music. We trust our reactions,we believe that they are true and that they accurately represent an internal state or condition.Perhaps the subjective validity of affective judgments and reactions and our confidence in thesejudgments derive from the Cartesian traditionBthat allows us to doubt everything except our ownfeelings, especially the feelings of doubt. Perhapsit reflects a basic reality.10Affective judgments implicate the selj. Whenwe evaluate an object or an event, we are describing not so much what is in the object or in theevent, but something that is in ourselves. Cognitive judgments deal with qualities that reside inthe stimulus This cat is black, Camembertand Brie are softripened cheeses. These judgments are made on Iscales that are orders ofstimuli Coombs, 1964. Affective judgments,however, are made on Jscales, that is, scales onwhich are located jointly the various stimulias well as the ideal preference point of the person. I dislike this black cat or I prefer Camembert to Brie are judgments on Jscales. Thus,affective judgments are always about the self.They identify the state of the judge in relation tothe object of judgment.Affective reactions are difficult to verbalize. Theremarkable aspect of first impressions of personsis their immediacy. When we meet a stranger, weknow within a fraction of a second whether welike the person or not. The reaction is instantaneous and automatic. Perhaps the feeling isnot always precise, perhaps we are not alwaysaware of it, but the feeling is always there. If ourlater experience with the stranger conflicts withthe first impression, we are terribly surprised. Weconsider it an exception. Paradoxically, this subjective validity of affective reaction, this certaintythat we know what we like, is often accompanied by our inability to verbalize the reasons forour attraction or repulsion to the person.11 Whenasked why we like someone, we say that we likethe person because he or she is nice, pleasant,or interesting. But these adjectives describeour reactions to the person, not the person. Theresimply arent very effective verbal means to communicate why we like people and objects or whatit is that we like about them.The communication of affect, therefore, reliesmuch more on the nonverbal channels Ekman Friesen, 1969 Schneider, Hastorf,  Ellsworth,1979. Yet it is remarkably efficient. And it isin the realm of nonverbal expression of feelingsthat their basic nature is again revealed. Theuniversality of emotional expression strongly suggests our evolutionary continuity with other species and the fundamental nature of affect. Thefacial expressions of humans upon biting into a9 Hume 1898, too, held that emotions passions cannot be false. A passion must be accompanied with somefalse judgment, in order to its being unreasonable andeven then tis not the passion properly speaking, which isunreasonable, but the judgment p. 196.10 Because nonverbal cues exchanged in social interaction are dominated by affect, they are perceived as having such properties as trustworthiness and freedom fromvoluntary control Schneider, Hastorf,  Ellsworth, 1979,pp. 123127.Mandler 197S, Neisser 1967, and Nisbett andWilson 1977 pointed out that individuals have no accessto the cognitions that occasion, mediate, or cause theiractions, that are parts of their attitudes, or that determine their preferences. On the basis of an extensive review of the social psychological literature, Nisbett andWilson 1977 concluded that introspective reports aboutinfluences on the subjects evaluations, decisions, and actions Were so unreliable as not to be trusted.AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  157sour apple and their expressions of surprise, anger,delight, or serenity are remarkably similar acrossall cultures and are not far removed from theexpressions of the great apes. Perhaps we havenot developed an extensive and precise verbalrepresentation of feeling just because in the prelinguistic human this realm of experience had anadequate representation in the nonverbal channel.The role of affective communication is particularly significant in the social interaction amonganimals. The effectiveness of communication ofaffect and the accuracy of recognition of affectiveexpression are illustrated by the results of Prattand Sackett 1967. They raised rhesus monkeysin conditions that allowed complete contact withpeers, in conditions that allowed only visual andauditory access, and in complete isolation. Themonkeys were then examined for the kinds ofanimals they preferred to approach. Those raisedunder the same conditions preferred each othertwice as much as those raised under different conditions, even when the stimulus animals were totalstrangers to the test monkeys. While it could notbe determined what sorts of cues allowed the animals to make these fine discriminations, it is verylikely that the three groups developed during thecourse of their previous experience distinct patterns of emotional responding to new stimuli andto strange individuals, and that the animals raisedunder the same conditions found each other moreattractive because of the familiarity of these emotional patterns.The reliance of affect on nonverbal means ofcommunication has, I believe, implications for theway it is processed. For if affect is not alwaystransformed into semantic content but is insteadoften encoded in, for example, visceral or muscularsymbols, we would expect information containedin feelings to be acquired, organized, categorized,represented, and retrieved somewhat differentlythan information having direct verbal referents.Recent electromyographic research provides strongevidence for the participation of muscular activityin the imagination, recall, and production of emotional states Lang, 1979 Schwartz, Fair, Salt,Mandel,  Klerman, 1976. In light of theseintuitions, it is not unreasonable to speculate thatthe processing of affect is closer to the acquisitionand retention of motor skills than of word lists.Affective reactions need not depend on cognition.At the turn of the century, Nakashima 1909a,1909b tried to find support for Wundts affectiveprimacy conjecture by comparing reaction timesfor psychophysical judgments and for preferences.He failed. But he did find evidence that judgments of pleasantness were independent of sensoryqualities and that these judgments could not havebeen mediated by these qualities. Similar independence, based on multidimensional scaling, hasbeen reported more recently, for example, in studying the perceptions of and preferences for softdrinks. Cooper 1973 found that similarity scaling yielded a space dominated by a colanessdimension, whereas preference scaling generated aspace dominated by popularity of the drinks.Generally, it appears that similarity judgmentspredict preferences only when the similarity judgments are themselves highly evaluative, as in thecase of admissions officers judging college candidates Klahr, 1969 or arttrained students judging paintings Berlyne, 197S OHare, 1976. Osgood 1962 took it as a given that the affectivereaction system is independent of any particularsensory modality p. 21.If there is indeed a separation between affectand cognition, then it is not surprising that research on preferences, attitudes, attractions, impressions, aesthetic judgments, and similar affective responsesresearch that commonly has invoked cognitive mediatorshas not been terriblysuccessful. If overall preferences were simply amatter of calculating the combination of weightedcomponent preferences, and if component preferences were nothing more than cognitive representations of object features marked with affect, thenthe problems of predicting attitudes, decisions,aesthetic judgments, or first impressions wouldhave been solved long ago. After all, these problems have been around for nearly a century. Yetexcept for trivial cases or cases in which theresponses are highly cognitive e.g., Yntema Torgersons 1961 study of judgments of ellipses, the cognitionbased solutions to these problems have rarely predicted more than 20 of thetotal variance.The dismal failure in achieving substantial attitude change through various forms of communication or persuasion is another indication that affectis fairly independent and often impervious to cognition. If attitudes consist of information unitsthat have affect or utilities attached to them, thento change an individuals attitude, what could besimpler than providing the individual withalternative information units that have the same sort158  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTof affect as that attached to the desired attitudeIf a person believes that Candidate A is honest,we can simply give the person information provingthat A is not honest. Or, we could change thecentrality or the weight of honesty. Yet thisapproach has been the least successful in attitudechange, Even the most convincing arguments onthe merits of spinach wont reduce a childs aversion to this vegetable. Direct persuasion effectshave been so weak that researchers have insteadturned to more pernicious avenues of attitudechange, such as insufficient justification, persuasionthrough distraction, the footinthedoor technique,or the bogus pipeline.It is unlikely that calculations based on discriminable component features and their affectivevalues will reliably predict our overall affectivereactions to objects and events. These reactionsdo not seem to be composites of such elements.An affective reaction to a person we meet emergeslong before any of these features can be identified,let alone evaluated. The assumption that component affect, utilities, or values attach themselvesto the very same features that the subject attendsto in a typical detection, recognition, discrimination, or categorization task is likely to be wrong.12The analysis of preferences is not simply an analysis of cold cognitive representations that have become hot, that is, cognitive representations thathave some affect attached to them.13 The stimulusfeatures that serve us so well in discriminating,recognizing, and categorizing objects and eventsmay not be useful at all in evaluating these objects. If this is indeed the case, then there mustexist a class of features that can combine morereadily with affect and thereby allow us to makethese evaluations, to experience attraction, repulsion, pleasure, conflict, and other forms of affect,and to allow us to have these affective reactionsquite early after the onset of the sensory input.These features might be quite gross, vague, andglobal. Thus, they might be insufficient as a121 did not have the slightest doubt of this assumption,however, when I wrote my dissertation Zajonc, 1955,which employed it without question.13 The term hot cognition has been used fairly indiscriminately, although it generally refers to cases whehaffect accompanies or qualifies information. I have amalignant tumor is a hot cognition. However, theemotional experience of listening to ones favorite pieceof music performed by ones favorite artist is less likelyto receive the label of hot cognition. It is even less meaningful to speak of hot cognitions when affect becomes separated from the original cognitions.basis for most cognitive judgmentsjudgmentseven as primitive as recognition, for example. Inorder to distinguish this class of features fromsimple discriminanda, I call them preferenda Zajonc, Note 2.I cannot be very specific about preferenda. Ifthey exist they must be constituted of interactionsbetween some gross object features and internalstates of the individualstates that can be alteredwhile the object remains unchanged, as, for example, when liking for a stimulus increases withrepeated experience. Color preferences are a casein point. Similarity scaling of color yields threedimensionsbrightness, hue, and saturationthatexplain almost all of the variance in similarityjudgments. But on the basis of Nakashimas1909a research and according to unpublishedwork of Premack and Kintsch Note 3, the scaling of color for preference would not reveal thesethree factors. If we did not know from othersources that brightness, hue, and saturation exhaust the entire range of differences among colors,then we would not discover them by means ofpreference scaling. Abstract preferences for colorand color preferences for classes of objects, suchas hair, cars, or houses, are still more problematicif we insist on using brightness, hue, and saturation in quantifying them. And the same appliesto face recognition Physical features do not serveas discriminanda for faces Milord, 1978 Patterson  Baddeley, 1977. It is therefore an interesting problem to discover what it is in color thatholds affect if it isnt brightness, hue, and saturation and what it is in a face that holds affectif it isnt physical features. The answer to thisproblem is probably that some physical aspects,perhaps vague, gross, or configural, are involved,but not alone. Preferenda must consist of aninteraction of these global features with some internal state or condition of the individual.Affective reactions may become separated fromcontent. It sometimes happens that we are reminded of a movie or of a book whose contents we are unable to recall. Yet the affect presentwhen leaving the movie or our general impressionof the book are readily accessible. Or we are reminded of an interpersonal conflict of long ago.The cause of the conflict, the positions taken, thematter at issue, who said what, may have all beenforgotten, and yet the affect that was present during the incident may be readily retrieved. Suchexperiences, together with such clinical phenomenaAMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  1S9as freefloating anxiety, hysteria, or posthypnotically induced moods, all point to the possibilitythat some aspects of affective processes might wellbe separate and partly independent of cold cognitions. Occasions when they are not include thosewhen an affective experience has been communicated to someone else or when it has been thoughtof a great deal. On such occasions an elaboratecognitive representation of affect occurs that maybe processed very much like any other type ofinformation. It is important to observe, however,that not all affective experiences are accompaniedby verbal or other cognitive representations andthat when they are, such representations are imprecise and ambiguous.Preferences Need No InferencesEmpirical EvidenceThe prevalent approach to the study of preferences and related affective phenomena holds thataffective reactions follow a prior cognitive processBefore I can like something I must first knowwhat it is. According to this prevalent view,therefore, such cold cognitive processes as recognition or categorization are primary in aestheticjudgments, in attitudes, in impression formation,and in decision making They come first. If wesay, for example, that we like John because he isintelligent, rich, and compassionate, it follows thatwe must have gained some impression of Johnsintelligence, wealth, and compassion, and combinedthem, before we formed an attraction to him. Thismust be especially so in the case of judgments ofnovel stimuli before the component units becomefused into an integrated structure. Thus, if thecomplexity of polygons is an important basis oftheir attractiveness, then polygons that are judgedpleasing or displeasing must have previouslybeen somehow examined for their complexity.Otherwise, the calculus of preferences makes littlesense.14The first indication that affect may not requireextensive participation of cold cognitive processesappeared in studies of the exposure effect, that is,the phenomenon of increasing preference for ob14 Affective reactions to objects that have been encountered and evaluated many times may become automated, thus gaining some independence from the component processes Shiffrin  Schneider, 1977. As such, theymay have different properties than first reactions, It isthose first affective reactions that is, those elicited whenindividuals are asked to evaluate objects totally novel tothem that I wish to consider at this point.jects that can be induced by virtue of mere repeated exposure Harrison, 1977 Zajonc, 1968.While the empirical results that established thephenomenon were quite consistent, their explanation continued to be very elusive. Theories thatattempted to account for the mere exposure effect,such as Harrisons 1968 response competitionhypothesis or Berlynes 1970 optimal arousaltheory, treated affect as resulting from a priorcognitive process. Both theories contained theremnants of Titcheners 1910 thesis on familiarity. In explaining the preference for familiar objects, Titchener attributed a critical role to recognition, which he thought gave the individual aglow of warmth, a sense of ownership, a feelingof intimacy p. 411. The majority of subsequent findings bearing on the explanation of theexposure effect, however, have revealed that recognition must play a relatively minor role, as mustthe subjective feeling of recognition.Matlin 1971 was the first to discover thatthe role of recognition in the exposure effect mayhave been overstated. During an initial experimental session, she presented Turkishlike wordseither three times or six times. Subsequently,these words, together with others that were notshown at all, were rated for liking and also forfamiliarity. That is, for each word the subjectshad to decide whether they saw it previously inthe exposure series and to report how much theyliked it. Table 1 shows Matlins results. Likingis averaged as a function of objective familiarityand as a function of subjective familiarity. Notethat there is an effect due to subjective familiarity,that is, when the subjects thought a stimulus wasold they rated it more positively than when theythought it was new. However, the objective history of the individuals experience with the stimulus is just as effective in influencing liking.

Subjects were given 0, 1, 3, 9, and27 prior exposures, counterbalanced, of course,with the stimuli. Following these exposures, thesubjects made a variety of recognition and likingjudgments. A number of findings are of interest.Many stimuli shown in the first series, some ofthem 27 times, were not recognized as familiarwhen shown later. Taking only those stimuli thatwere so judged, and relating the rated attractiveness of these stimuli to their actual number ofexposures, we obtained correlations of .43 in oneexperiment and of ,50 in another. An objectivehistory of exposure influenced liking of stimuli forwhich the subjects could not have felt a glow ofwarmth or a sense of ownership.We also performed another type of analysis.Because we had a sufficient number of measures,we were able to use linear structural equationanalyses to evaluate various causal models of ourdata. We used the LISREL III program seeJoreskog  Sorbom, 1977 to calculate maximumlikelihood estimates for causal models that assigndifferent roles to the recognition factor. Theprogram distinguishes between latent variablesconstructs and their observed indicators measures. By estimating the unknown coefficientsin a system of simultaneous equations for anyparticular model, the program describes the pattern of relations among the latent variables, distinguishing causal effects from unexplained variation in each case.The results of this analysis are shown in Figure2. Latent variables are shown in ellipses, whilemeasures of those variables are shown in rectangles. The coefficients linking the ellipses withthe boxes represent the validities with which particular latent variables were assessed by their measures. Path coefficients linking the latent variables to each other represent causal relations.Unexplained variation in the latent variables Viand V2 and error in the various measures Eithrough E5 are also shown.

Reprinted by permission.impact of repeated exposure, people gain an increasing ability to recognize the stimulusTheyachieve a feeling of subjective familiarity and anawareness of recognition, which authors sinceTitchener have thought to be the necessary conditions for an increased positive affect toward thestimulus. This is the purely cold effect that iscapable of generating the eventual glow ofwarmth. However, we wanted to know as wellwhether, quite independently of this cold cognitive effect, there is also an affective change, orhot effectthat is, whether subjects acquire amore positive attitude toward the object as exposure increases, independently of recognition.They do. While the path coefficient from stimulusexposure to subjective recognition is substantial.53, indicating that recognition improves withexposure, there also is a hot effect There is astrong path from stimulus exposure to subjectiveaffect that is independent of recognition .66.We can compare this model with one that isentirely cold, that is, with one that requires theentire process to be mediated by cognitive factors,by the discriminanda. This model, shown in Figure 3, says essentially that whatever affectivechanges take place as a result of exposure areentirely mediated by stimulus recognition. Theresult of requiring affect to be mediated by recognition is a substantial reduction in the efficiencyof prediction. The x2 in the previous model was39.0 df  5 and in this model is 83.6 df  6,generating a significant p  .01 difference between the two models of x 2  l   44.6.The experiments just described all involved presentation of stimuli under optimal conditionsthat is, there was nothing to prevent the subjectsfrom registering what was shown and from memorizing the information presented to them. Subjective recognition and the likelihood of recognition were controlled by statistical techniques. Andthe results showing that stimulus recognition wasnot a necessary condition for the exposure effectwere correlational.Much firmer evidence, however, that hot cognition is quite short on cognition was collected byW. R. Wilson 197S, who controlled for recognition experimentally by means of an ingenious technique. He employed the method of dichotic listening in order to reduce recognition to a chancelevel. Random sequences of tones, such as thoseconstructed by Vitz 1964, were presented to oneear, and a story was simultaneously presented tothe other. Subjects were asked to track the storyon a written page to verify whether what theyheard corresponded to the printed text. The melodies were played five times each. The subjectswere subsequently given a recognition memorytest in which the earlier melodies and other melodies that they had never heard were played. Butnow there was no interference from the other channel, and no other task was required of the subject. The subjects also rated all the melodies forliking, some subjects giving their recognition memory judgments before, others after, the ratingsfor liking. The procedure succeeded in reducingrecognition memory nearly to the chance level.The accuracy of recognition was 59 in one experiment and only 53 in another.Table 2 shows the results of these experiments.Again, as in the case of previous results, likingvaries with subjective recognition. But apart fromthis effect, liking also varies with the objective history of stimulus exposure. With recognition reducednearly to the chance level, differential affectivereaction to the stimuli is obtained as a consequenceof mere repeated exposure. Random melodies162  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTpresented five times were liked better than melodies never heard, even though the subjects couldnot discriminate the former from the latter forfamiliarity.In a followup of these studies, KunstWilsonwho is the same person as W. R. Wilson and Itried to reproduce the effect in a visual modeKunstWilson  Zajonc, 1980. Random polygons were constructed and presented for an extremely brief time intervalin fact, only 1 millisecond. Subsequently, the subjects rated the polygons for liking and were tested for their recognition memory. Judgments were made in pairedcomparisons to avoid possible response bias.Again, recognition was at a chance level 48.However, of the stimuli that were liked, 60were old and 40 were new. Sixteen of 24 subjects liked objectively old stimuli better than newstimuli, but only 5 of 24 recognized them as suchat better than chance level. And of the 24 subjects, 17 showed better discrimination betweenobjectively old and objectively new stimuli in theiraffective judgments than in their recognition responses, while only 4 showed such superiority ofrecognition over affective judgments. Thus, thesubjects were able to distinguish between the oldand new stimuli if they used liking as their response, but they were not able to distinguish between them if they had to identify them as oldor new. This result may be taken as, evidencethat a Class of features preferenda exists thatallows individuals to experience affect toward objects but does not allow them to accomplish cognitive tasks as simple as those in recognitionmemory tests.TABLE 2Average Stimulus A feet Ratings as a Function ofObjective Familiarity OldNew and SubjectiveFamiliarity OldNewSubjective famil iar i tyObjective familiarityOldExperiment IExperiment IINewExperiment IExperiment IIMExperiment IExperiment IIOld4.203.513.7S3.034.023.29New4.033.853.073.023.523.40M4.123.663.303.03Note. Data are from Wilson 1975.These experiments establish, I believe, that affective reactions to a stimulus may be acquiredby virtue of experience with that stimulus even ifnot accompanied by such an elementary cold cognitive process as conscious recognition. Thus, atheory that assumes that subjective experiences ofnovelty and familiarity mediate the affective response acquired during the course of exposuresmust contend with the results showing that withthe subjective experience of novelty held constant,systematic variations in affect can be obtainedjust by means of an objective manipulation of exposure.However, one should not assume that no formof recognition occurred. Obviously, some discrimination, however primitive or minimal, must havetaken place, even though it must have been ata level not accessible to the subjects awareness.It is somewhat surprising that any effect at allwas obtained with exposures as short as 1 millisecond, but it should be noted that the stimuliwere high contrast black on white and that nomask was used. Detectable effects with 1millisecond exposures were also obtained by Shevrinand Fritzler 1968 and by Shevrin, Smith, andFritzler 1971. These authors reported differential evoked potentials and word associations tocritical and control stimuli presented for 1 millisecondstimuli that the subject could neitherrecognize nor identify. Even more pertinent isthe work of Marcel Note 4. He presented overa large number of trials either a single word ora blank always followed by a mask. The exposureduration of the word was varied. The subjectswere then asked whether anything had been presented before the mask. If they answered yes,two words were then presented to them underoptimal conditions. The subjects were then askedwhich of these two words was more visually similar to the one shown before the mask. Finally,they were asked which of these same two wordswas more semantic ally similar to the stimulusshown before the mask. With decreasing stimulus exposure, all three types of judgments tendedto become less accurate, and eventually all threereached the chance level. But the first to becometotally unreliable were judgments regarding theactual presence of the stimulus words. The secondtype of judgment to be reduced to a chance levelby the decreasing exposures was that concernedwith physical similarity. And when the subjectswere totally unable to rise above chance in comAMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  163SUREto 2.5iUlz 2.0UJQU8 1.5GUESSa ..IKEDISLIKEOLD NEW6w,LIKING RECOGNITIONFIRST FIRSTFigure 4. Confidence in liking and recognitionjudgments. Drawn from data reported by KunstWilson  Zajonc, 1980.paring physical similarities of the words, theywere still judging their semantic similarities quitereliably.Marcels results are reminiscent of those reported by Broadbent and Gregory 1967, whofound that unpleasant words such as bloodwere more often misperceived as other unpleasantwords such as death than as equally probableneutral words. Marcels results, moreover, are ofparticular interest if we consider the consistentfindings from the semantic differential literatureshowing that meaning is very highly saturated withaffect. If it is indeed affect that allows subjectsto make a semantic match in the absence of conscious recognition, then deciding which of twogiven words is emotionally more similar to a stimulus word should be at least as easy as decidingwhich is semantically more similar. This experiment, in fact, is now being carried out by Moreland and myself.Another consequence derives from the prevalentapproach to affect and cognition. Prevalent theories, especially the one developed by the lateDaniel Berlyne 1967, generally assume that theaffective reaction occurs in response to the levelof arousal, which in turn is mediated by collativevariables such as complexity, novelty, or congruity. If complexity, congruity, and novelty mediate liking, in that objects and events are likedjust because they are optimally complex or simple,novel or familiar, then the judgments of objectsalong these dimensions should, in general, be morestable, more consistent, and made sooner thanaffective judgments. At the very least, these judgments should not be slower, more inconsistent,unstable, or inefficient than affective ratings. Inparticular, we would expect that recognition judgments, for example, which reflect the operation ofthe collative variable of novelty, should be madewith greater confidence than liking judgments.Figure 4 shows the results from our previousstudy with KunstWilson using 1millisecond exposures. The results show that compared toliking judgments, recognition judgments are madewith much less confidence. The differences are,in fact, hugemore than 6 times their standarderrors. Even if we take only the recognition judgments on which the subject was correct, this effectremains true.11One more bit of data. According to the prevalent view, attending to discriminanda alone shouldbe easier and quicker than attending to discriminanda tagged with values. Since the latter involve more information, more detail must be attended to, and the subject would consequentlylr We suspected that these results may be due to thefact that the subjects knew they could be wrong onthe oldnew judgments, and awareness of this fact mighthave induced caution in them. But they could not bewrong on their liking judgments. These latter judgments express opinions, and people generally feel free tohold any opinions whatsoever. We tried, therefore, toobjectify affective judgments and to subjectify recognition judgments in order to determine whether the confidence ratings would be reversed. To obtain objectifiedaffective ratings, subsequent to stimulus exposures, weasked subjects in another experiment to rate the polygonsfor their aesthetic value. We told them also in thisconnection that our polygons had all been rated for aes, thetic value by art critics. To obtain subjectified recognition judgments, we told the subjects that one of thetwo polygons in each slide might appear more familiarthan the other and asked the subjects to indicate whichone did in fact appear more familiar. Thus, the subjectscould now be wrong in their affective judgments, whereas, recognition became much more a matter of subjectiveimpression. The results did not change a great deal.Confidence was a little greater for subjective familiarityjudgments than for the oldnew judgments and a littleweaker for aesthetic judgments than for judgments ofoutright liking. But these differences were quite small.The means were 2.01 and 2.41 for familiarity and aesthetic judgments, whereas they were 1.60 and 2.29 forrecognition and liking.164  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTrequire more processing time. If familiarity mediates the affective reaction generated as the resultof repeated exposures, then judgments of familiarity should be made quicker than judgments ofliking. If anything, however, our results showedthe opposite. Although of only borderline significance, affective judgments of polygons were madefaster than recognition judgments.Feeling and Thought Two SystemsAbout 10 years ago, Hyde and Jenkins 1969carried out an experiment in which subjects weretested for recall of word lists to which they wereexposed under different conditions. Some subjects were simply exposed to the words with theinstruction to pay close attention. Of three othergroups one was instructed to count the numberof letters in each word, another to report thepresence of the letter E, and a third to rate eachword for pleasantness. In some groups the subjects were warned that they would be tested forrecall in others they were not warned. Hyde andJenkinss results were quite strong. Among boththe subjects who were warned about a future recalltest and those who were not warned, those askedto rate pleasantness showed the best recall. Hydeand Jenkins took their data to mean that itemsare arranged differently in storage dependingon the context prevailing during acquisition. Thesuperior performance of subjects who rated thewords for pleasantness was due to the fact thatthese subjects acquired the words as units ofmeaning and could therefore recruit for themsupportive components of associative structures.When words are examined for number of lettersor the presence of the letter E, such structuresare not activated and the recall is unorganizedHyde  Jenkins, 1969, p. 480.Since, as we have seen earlier, the semantic content of verbal material is saturated with affect,the facilitation that occurred as a result of priorpleasantness ratings in the Hyde and Jenkins experiment could have strong affective components.Two conditions of a recent experiment by Rogers,Kuiper, and Kirker 1977 are of particular interest in this respect. In all conditions, their subjects were tested for recall of previously shownadjectives. In one condition, the subjects had tocheck the adjectives to see if they were printed inthe same or different type as a sample print structural, and in another whether they rhymed withcomparison words phonemic. But in two conditions the subjects were required to engage in extensive semantic processing of the adjectives Inone they checked the adjectives to see if theymeant the same as comparison words semanticand in another to see whether they described thesubject selfreference. Note that while theselast two conditions both activate semantic structures within which the adjectives are imbedded,the selfreference condition brings the subject intoa cognitive domain greatly charged with affect.Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirkers findings are especially significant in view of the virtual discontinuity of the selfreference effects. Of the 10 selfreference adjectives, 2.84 were correctly recalled.In contrast, only .34, .68, and 1.33 adjectives werecorrectly recalled in the structural, phonemic, andsemantic treatments, respectively.Another group of similar studies that used recognition memory rather than recall also suggestsstrong participation of affect in information processing. Formulating their experimental problemin depthofprocessing terms Craik  Lockhart,1972, Bower and Karlin 1974 showed photographs of faces to subjects with instructions tojudge the photographs for gender, honesty, orlikeability. Following exposures, subjects weretested for recognition memory in two experiments.The hit rate was higher when the subjects ratedphotographs for honesty or likeability than whenthey reported gender. Strnad and Mueller 1977replicated Bower and Karlins results in a betweensubjects design, and Warrington and Ackroyd197S found parallel effects when comparing theseeffects for faces and words, also in a betweensubjects design. According to Bower and Karlin1974, deeper processing facilitates recognitionbecause it forces the subject to attend to a greatervariety of detail. Judgment of honesty of facewould appear to require comparison to an idiosyncratic set of vague prototype criteria regardingthe patterning of features such as distance between the eyes, size of pupils, curvature of themouth, thickness of lips, and so on p. 7S6.They went on to say that if you want to remember a persons face, try to make a number ofdifficult personal judgments about his face whenyou are first meeting him pp. 756757. Patterson and Baddeley 1977 asked subjects to dojust that In one condition their subjects ratedphotographs of faces for the length of nose, distance between the eyes, roundness of face, or fullness of lips. In another condition the ratingsAMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  16Swere vague and less detailed but much more likelyto recruit affect nicenasty, reliableunreliable,intelligentdull, and livelystolid. Recognitionmemory, as reflected by d and by hit and falsealarm rates, was clearly superior for what Patterson and Baddeley called personality ratings.Patterson and Baddeley 1977 thus disagreedwith Bower and Karlin and concluded that theirown results clearly did not implicate analysis offacial features as a critical or optimal basis forface recognition p. 411. Instead, they believedthat should they ever find an optimum strategyfor encoding of faces, analysis of individual features is unlikely to be its focus p. 417 .There seems to be general agreement that whenjudgments of pleasantness are made of faces or ofadjectives, individuals engage in forms of deeperinformation processing. What is not agreed uponis the type of content that is accessed at thesedeeper levels. Patterson and Baddeley 1977doubt that face recognition is based on the sortsof discriminanda that we would intuitively suspectof serving recognition. But if these discriminandaare not the basis of face recognition, what isIs face recognition, then, based on preferendaRecall in this respect that the scaling of faces forsimilarity yields pleasantness as the major factor,explaining about 50 of the variance, whereasphysical features play a relatively minor role.Clearly, the contribution of affect to face recognition has been underestimated. Early face discrimination is based primarily on affective reactions. Infants smile at an approaching face asearly as 10 weeks of age, and at 12 weeks theysmile differently at familiar and unfamiliar facesIzard, 1978.Curiously enough, none of the above studiesmention the possible role of affect in processingface information. And none of the studies onrecognition memory of faces collected reactiontime data to verify whether the assumed deeperprocessing was accompanied by longer responselatencies. However, in one recent study, Keenanand Bailett 1979 used methods similar to thoseof Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker 1977 but insteadadministered recognition memory tests. They report results that have an important bearing onthe form of information processing that mayemerge when affect is involved. As in the previousstudies, a number of adjectives were presented,and the subjects were required to check themagainst a number of criteria. For example, subjects were asked whether the given adjective described themselves, a best friend, a parent, another friend, a teacher or boss, a favorite TVcharacter, or Jimmy Carter. Also asked for someadjectives was a semantic encoding questionMeans the same as  Following theinitial series, subjects were given a recognitionmemory task in which the original adjectives wereinterspersed among an equal number of similardistractor items. Keenan and Bailetts results arevery clear. Selfreference generated by far thehighest recognition performance over 90,whereas reference to Jimmy Carter produced arecognition rate of less than 65. The otherrecognition rates were arranged according to thesocial signfkance that the target had for the subject best friend, parent, friend, and teacher.If the superior recognition memory for the selfreference items was due to deeper processing, onewould expect that response times for these itemswould be longer than response times for itemsprocessed at shallow levels. However, the resultswere quite the opposite and very strikingly so.Encoding times for selfreference items were byfar the shortest. The longest reaction time wasfound for items referred to Jimmy Carter notethat the experiment was run in 1977 when Carterwas not quite as well known as he is now. Moreover, the other targets had response times thatvaried directly with the proportion of correct recognitions.Keenan and Bailett 1979 attempt a varietyof cognitive interpretations, but at the conclusionof what is truly a valiant effort, they offer thepossibility that in the course of processing selfreferent information, the crucial dimension underlying memory is not what the subject knowsor the amount of knowledge that is used in encoding the item, but rather what the subject feelsabout what he knows p. 2 5  , It is no longerclear that deeper processing necessarily requiresmore time. Structures that are highly integratedand that have been frequently tuned in mayprocess information quite rapidly. The relationbetween reaction time and depth of processing cannot be predicted, therefore, for all tasks Baddeley, 1978. Keenan and Bailetts study may betaken as evidence against the levelsofprocessingapproach. But it may also be taken as evidencethat the participation of affect in processing information of some types may increase efficiencyto a remarkable degree. The beneficial role of166  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTaffect in memory is dramatically illustrated in apairedassociates study in which Sadalla and Loftness 1972 asked subjects to form pleasant, unpleasant, and nonemotional images for each pairand found considerably poorer performance for theneutral pairs than for either the pleasant or theunpleasant pairs.It is this type of result that suggests the possibility of some separation between affect and cognition. Consider the task in those experimentswhere the subject is asked to verify if a givenadjective, say honest, describes him or her. Itis most unlikely that the process of this verification involves checking the item for its presencein a list, as some informationprocessing modelswould have it. For one thing, no evidence suggests even vaguely that the self is represented asa list of trait adjectives Markus, 1977. Foranother, the question is probably not interpretedby the subject to mean Is the trait honest trueof you but more likely to mean Is the traithonest consistent with your perception of yourself If this is indeed the interpretation thatthe subject imposes upon the task, then we mustinquire what may be meant by consistent withyour perception of yourself To some extentthis consistency may involve absence of contentthat is mutually contradictory for example, theperson could not be both tall and short. Butmore important, some form of affective consistencis probably involved. That is, the self as usedin this task is probably some global and generalimpression suffused with affective quality. Whatis matched is primarily the affective quality of theitem with the affective quality of the impression.Of course, the shorter processing times for selfreferent items may be due to the fact that wehave more integrated and better structured impressions of ourselves and of people who are important to us. But it is equally true that theself is a target charged with strong, widespread,and clear affect, and an emotional match wouldtherefore be quite easy for the subject to verify.There is a need in these studies to separate theelaboration and integration of the cognitive structure from the affect that pervades it, but such acontrol procedure is difficult, for the two properties are highly correlated.That the affective qualities in impression formation are processed differently and perhaps separately from the cognitive content that carriesthat impression is shown both by Anderson andHubert 1963 and by Posner and Snyder 1975b.In a typical impression formation task, the firstauthors found strong primacy effects for impressions i.e., the overall affective rating of the person was influenced more by early trait adjectivesin the list and an equally strong recency effectfor the recall of the adjectives. Anderson andHubert 1963 suggested that the impressionresponse is based on a different memory systemthan that which underlies the verbal recall p.388. They did not go on to specify how thesetwo systems might differ except to say that aseach adjective is received, its meaning is extractedand combined with the current impression, thusyielding a changed impression. Once this is done,memory for the adjective per se is no longer necessary for the impression process pp. 390391.Dreben, Fiske, and Hastie 1979 found similarorder effects for impressions, and Hamilton, Katz,and Leirer in press obtained better recall whensubjects organized items into an impression of aperson than when subjects regarded these itemsas discrete units. More important for the dualprocess hypothesis, however, is the finding ofDreben, Fiske, and Hastie that the weights calculated for the adjectives did not predict their recall.That is, the adjectives assumed to be contributingthe most to impression are not necessarily also theones that are best recalled. Following his cognitive response theory, Greenwald 1980 suggestedthat cues effective in helping the individual retrieve content may not be the same ones that areeffective in helping retrieve the evaluative aspectsof the content. It is not unreasonable to supposethat the major difference between these two typesof cues may be the difference between discriminanda and preferenda. And it is perhaps the difference between these cues that is also involved inthe perseverance effect Ross, Lepper,  Hubbard,1975, in that details of initial information aboutsuccess or failure are used only to construct anoverall impression of ones own task competenceand are soon discarded. Thus, in debriefing, whenthe experimenter tells the subjects that their success or failure was rigged, this new informationmay no longer be capable of making contact withthe original input which by then has been recoded and discarded and may therefore havelittle effect on its original affective consequences.Posner and Snyder 197Sb also argue for adual memory. In their experiments, subjects areshown a sentence such as James is honest, loyal,AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  167and mature, and in a subsequent display a probeword such as foolish is flashed. Two tasks arestudied. In one the subject is asked to verify ifthe word itself was among those in the precedingsentence. In another, the required match is between the emotional tone of the word and that ofthe preceding sentence. The interesting resultthese authors obtain is that, as the length of thelist increases, reaction times increase for wordmatching and decrease for emotional tone matching. Posner and Snyder 197Sb agree with Anderson and Hubert about the two memory systemsfor the component adjectives and for the overallimpression, but they doubt that the emotionalinformation concerning impression is handled inany different way than other semantic dimensionsin the memory system p, 80. Their doubtsshould be weakened by a recent impressionformation experiment in which the pattern of recall ofindividual adjectives was effectively manipulatedin the hope of thereby affecting the primacy ofimpressions. Riskey 1979 was able to changethe recall of adjectives, but the primacy of impressions nevertheless remained unchanged.While these authors propose separate systems,it is always separate cognitive systems that theypropose. In contrast, the separation being considered here is between an affective and a cognitive systema separation that distinguishes between cliscriminanda and preferenda and that takesus back to Wundt and Bartlett, who speculatedthat the overall impression or attitude has anexistence of its own, independent of the components that contributed to its emergence. Thequestion that cannot be answered with the datathus far collected is whether the affectcontentseparation is simply a matter of separate storageas Anderson and Hubert, on the one hand, andPosner and Snyder, on the other, have proposedor whether there isnt some separation already atthe point of registration and encoding. The rapidprocessing times of affect suggest a more completeseparation of the two processes at several junctures.One is necessarily reminded in this context ofthe dual coding hypothesis proposed by Paivio1975 for the processing of pictures and words.Paivio 1978a suggested a number of differencesbetween the processing of these types of content,for example, that representations of picturesemerge as perceptual isomorphs or analogs imagens, whereas parallel units in the verbal systemare linguistic components logogens. He alsoproposed that pictorial information is organizedin a synchronous and spatially parallel manner,whereas verbal information is discrete and sequential. Finally, he suggested that the processing of pictures is more likely to be the business ofthe rightbrain hemisphere, whereas the processingof words is the business of the left. Paivios proposal for a dual coding theory kindled a controversy of some vigor. While Anderson 1978 hasrecently argued that the controversy cannot beresolved with what we now know about theseprocesses, it has nevertheless stimulated some exciting empirical and theoretical work e.g., Banks Flora, 1977 Kerst  Howard, 1977 Kosslyn Pomerantz, 1977 Paivio, 1978b Pylyshyn, 1973Shepard, 1978.Most relevant for my discussion, however, isPaivios 1978c finding that reaction times forpleasantunpleasant ratings are faster for picturesthan for words. Paivio takes this result to indicate that the analog information involved inpleasantness and value judgments is more closelyassociated with the image system than with theverbal system p. 207 . Thisanalog pleasantness information is carried by affectiveand motor processes that are closely associated with visualmemory representations of things. Such processes presumably originate as reactions to things and persist asaffective or motor memories that can be activated bypictures of the referent objects, or, more indirectly, by theirnames when accompanied by the appropriate contextualcues. More specifically, pleasantness and value judgmentsmight be based on continuously variable interoceptive reactions and approach or avoidance tendencies that areactivated jointly by the comparison stimuli and the taskinstructions, p. 207However, the specific responses of the autonomicnervous system are not readily discriminable, sincethere are not many receptors to register the finechanges in autonomic processes Averill, 1969Mandler, Mandler, Kremen,  Sholiton, 1961.Moreover, interoceptive process and motor memories are slower than the affective responses theyare presumed to activate.It is a fact, of course, that all sorts of judgments are faster and more efficient for picturesthan for words, and this may be so just becausepictures are able to evoke an affective reactionmore directly and faster than words. An affectivereaction aroused early in the encoding processearlier than it is possible for the interoceptive andmotor memories to become effectivemight facilitate a complex cognitive encoding sequence by aninitial categorization along affective lines, which,168  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTas we have seen, requires minimal stimulus information. Such facilitation through early affective sorting that relies not only on discriminandabut on preferenda as well may also induce a constructive process that can more readily recruitstored content by searching for congruent affectivetags,10This review suggests that a separation betweenaffect and cognition may well have a psychologicaland a biological basis.17 Recall that in contrastwith cold cognitions, affective responses are effortless, inescapable, irrevocable, holistic, more difficult to verbalize, yet easy to communicate and tounderstand. Consider also that the processing ofaffect is probably an even stronger candidate forthe right hemisphere than the processing of pictures Carmon  Nachson, 1973 Dimond, Farrington,  Johnson, 1976 Ley  Bryden, 1979Milner, 1968 Safer  Leventhal, 1977 Schwartz,Davidson,  Maer, 1975. In the context of thisreview it is especially interesting a that facerecognition is superior when the stimuli are pre18 Another area of research  in which affect may beimplicated although it had not been so suspected is thefrequencyjudgment paradigm. Typically, in these experiments .subjects are shown stimuli in different frequencies, and two types of judgments are collected afterwards. In one condition, the subjects are shown the oldstimuli interspersed among new ones and are asked toreport for each item whether it is new or old. In theother condition, the subjects must say how often eachstimulus occurred. It turns out that the frequency judgment generates greater accuracy than the binary recognition memory judgment e.g., Proctor, 1977 Proctor Ambler,1975.Two findings are of interest in the present context.First, subjects have remarkable confidence in their frequency judgments Howell, 1971. Second, warning thesubjects that they will be estimating frequencies of eventsvs. simply recalling them and varying the length ofthe list both influence free recall but have little if anyeffect on frequency estimation Howell, 1973. It thusappears that frequency judgments behave like affectivejudgments. It is possible, therefore, that frequency estimation is more likely to invoke an underlying affectivereaction which accrues from repeated stimulus exposuresthan the binary recognition memory task. It may behotter. Since frequency judgment makes exposure effectssalient and since it requires finer discrimination thanrecognition memory, it may recruit affect as an auxiliarysource of information. In fact, it has been suggestedthat recognition memory responses and frequency estimation are not made from the same sources of informationWells, 1974, although what these sources are and howthey differ from each other is not altogether clear Hintzman, 1976.17 Multiple processing systems and multiple channel conceptions are today more the rule than the exception inthe study of sensory processes Graham  Nachmias,1971 Trevarthen, 1968.sented in the left visual field De Renzi Si Spinnler, 1966 Moscovitch, Scullion,  Christie, 1976,and b that the recognition of emotional expressions shows the same rightbrain superioritySuberi  McKeever, 1977.It has also been suggested to me by Richard J.Katz Note 5 that there exists a network in thecentral nervous system, the locus coeruleus, whichis ideally suited for the kind of partially independent processing of affect that I have suggestedhere. The potential sensitivity of the locus coeruleus to preferenda can be inferred from a numberof interesting properties and features of this system. Above all, it is excited differently by noveland by familiar stimuli. Second, selfstimulationstudies have demonstrated that the locus coeruleusis sensitive to incentives. It is further knownthat it is capable of innervating sensory areassuch as the colliculi and geniculate bodies, emotional areas the amygdala and hypothalamus,mnestic areas the hippocampus, and the cerebral cortices. Most important, however, is thefact that the locus coeruleus is capable of veryfast responding. Finally, Katz also noted that theenkephalenergic system, which controls the actionof enkephalins naturally occurring opiates andis situated at the locus coeruleus, is also involvedin reinforcement and in different reactions tonovelty and familiarity. All of this means, at thevery least, that what I have proposed about theprocessing of affect is not inconsistent with recentknowledge about the relevant neurophysiologicalmechanisms. It means that the organism isequipped with a neurochemical apparatus capableof telling the new from the old and the good fromthe bad, of remembering the old, the good, andthe bad, and of making all these decisions rapidlywithout having to wait for the slow feedback fromthe autonomic system.Affective reactions are primary in ontogeny.The infant knows to cry and to smile long beforeit acquires any semblance of verbal skills Izard,1978, 1979. Meltzoff and Moore 1977 reportthat human infants can imitate emotional expressions at 12 days of age, long before they acquirelanguage. And goodbad is one of the very firstdiscriminations that children learn.More important, however, affect is clearly primary in philogeny. Affect was there before weevolved language and our present form of thinking.The limbic system that controls emotional reactions was there before we evolved language andAMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  169Figure 5. Time course of the stimulus, sensation, affect, and cold cognitions R  response.our present form of thinking. It was there beforethe neocortex, and it occupies a large proportionof the brain mass in lower animals. Before weevolved language and our cognitive capacities,which are so deeply dependent on language, it wasthe affective system alone upon which the organism relied for its adaptation. The organisms responses to the stimuli in its environment wereselected according to their affective antecedentsand according to their affective consequences.Thus, if the most recent version of homo sapiensspecifies that affective reactions are mediated byprior cognitive processesas contemporary cognitive views would have itthen at some pointin the course of evolution, affect must have lostits autonomy and acquired an intermediary in theform of cold cognition. This scenario seems mostunlikely. When nature has a direct and autonomous mechanism that functions efficientlyandthere is no reason to suppose that the affectivesystem was anything elseit does not make itindirect and entirely dependent on a newly evolvedfunction. It is rather more likely that the affective system retained its autonomy, relinquishingits exclusive control over behavior slowly andgrudgingly. At most, the formerly sovereign affective system may have accepted an alliancewith the newly evolved system to carry out someadaptive functions jointly. These conjecturesmake a twosystem view more plausible than onethat relegates affect to a secondary role mediatedand dominated by cognition.Because it is so heavily rooted in verbal skills,the cognitive system in humans has properties thatare quite distinct from those of affect. Above all,the cognitive system is infinitely more diverse andflexible than the affective system. Anything atall can be said and thought with various degreesof precision, and these things can be said andthought in an infinite variety of ways. But thereare only a handful of emotions and feelings thatcan be felt, and they can be felt only in somefew, very constrained ways. And for reasons thatmust be rooted in the partial separation of thetwo systems, affect can be communicated muchmore efficiently and accurately than thought inspite of the fact that its vocabulary is quite limited. It was a wise designer who provided separately for each of these processes instead of presenting us with a multiplepurpose appliance that,like the rotisseriebroileroventoaster, performsnone of its functions well.ConclusionIt is too early to write a model for affect and forthe various ways that it interacts with cold cognitions. The important pieces of evidence are stillmissing. However, we can begin to specify thefacts that such a model must accommodate. Figure 5 summarizes these facts by schematizing thetime course of the stimulus together with theensuing sensory process, the affective response,and some simple aspects of the cognitive processrecognition and feature identification. A stimulus is presented for a fixed time interval. Thestimulus triggers a number of processes that canvary in their onset times and offset times. I haveshown these processes as ranges of their onsettimes, ignoring the offset times altogether for thepresent purposes. I have also ignored the factthat under some conditions, stimulus onset canbe anticipated by the response process. The onset times of these four processes are influenced bystimulus conditions and by subject states e.g.,previous experience with stimuli of the given class,exposure to immediately preceding stimuli thatmay generate contrast or assimilation, knowledge,mood states, priming, or expectation.170  FEBRUARY 1980  AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGISTNote that a variety of temporal relations holdsamong affect, recognition, and feature identification. Of course, sensory process must have theearliest onset. Its onset times, too, differ depending on the stimulus, level of attention of the organism, the peripheral processes that are activated,context, etc. Also, an affective reaction alwaysdirectly follows the sensory input. In RI thisreaction is strong and salient, and it might dominate the ensuing cognitive process. In R2 and R3,affect .shown in broken circles is also arousedimmediately following the sensory process, but it isweak and does not significantly influence the subsequent stages of the cognitive process. But for affect, recognition, and feature discrimination, all combinations are possible. I have given examples ofthree of the six possible response patterns. In RI,affect is first, recognition occurs later, and feature discrimination is last. The primacy of affectover recognition in RI reflects our own dataKunstWilson  Zajonc, in press and the resultsof typical subliminal perception experiments e.g.,Blum  Barbour, 1979 Shevrin  Fritzler, 1968.The difference between recognition and featurediscrimination that favors the former reflects theresults of Patterson and Baddeley 1977, who,it will be recalled, found that subjects could recognize photographs better when they judged themon personality characteristics than when theyjudged them on specific physical features. Theresults of Marcel 1976 and of Keenan andBailett 1979 also suggest that recognition canprecede feature identification.18RQ presents the case typically considered byinformationprocessing models The cognitive process begins with the individual first discriminatinga critical feature that allows recognition. Andfinally it is recognition that gives rise to the affective response. In Rs, recognition precedes feature identification, as is the case when lettersthat form words are recognized better than lettersthat do not form words Johnston  McClelland,1974 or when meaning is apprehended while theword itself cannot be identified, as in the paralexic response of certain aphasic patients Marshall  Newcombe,. 1966.Figure 5 shows the lower temporal limits ofthese reactions. Except for the sensory process,affect is assumed to be capable of the earliest onset. How can that bePerhaps the following analysis, speculative tobe sure, may point to some possible answers. Decisions about affect require the least informationand are often based on a different decision schemethan either recognition or feature identification.Each of the three, affect, recognition, and featureidentification, is a form of categorization. Affective reactions of the type considered here are forthe most part unidimensional and sometimes justbinary safedangerous, goodbad, or nicenasty.Such binary decisions can under some circumstances be made quite reliably, even in the absence of reliable bases. Moore and Shannon1956 have shown that reliable circuits can beconstructed using arbitrarily unreliable relays, provided the relays form parallel circuits that aremutually redundant. Zajonc and Smoke 1959applied this principle to group performance, andSmoke and Zajonc 1962 to group decisions.That is, given certain group decision processes,groups can make judgments much more reliablythan the average group member. An analogoussituation may well exist for affect where the stimulus triggers several parallel responses and the decision scheme can well be a minimal quorum.10Recognition, however, even though it also constitutes a binary choice oldnew, does not have asimilar advantage because the redundancy of thecomponent criteria e.g., features of configuralproperties is seldom as high as in the case ofaffect. Moreover, minimal quorum is seldom adecision basis. In fact, in experimental work onrecognition memory, great care is taken to assurethat criterial features are fairly independent ofeach other. Just because a photograph shows theface of a male is not sufficient for calling it oldor rejecting it as new, unless previous exposures have shown only female faces.Each of the responses in Figure 5 can facilitate the ones succeeding it. An affective reactioncan thus act to precategorize the stimulus for thesubject trying to decide whether it is old ornew. And recognition may facilitate featureidentification by a similar prior selection process.Each operation reduces the universe of alternatives for the next choice. It is therefore entirelypossible for stimuli that have a strong effectivepotential to evoke affective reactions rapidly, to berecognized sooner than neutral stimuli, and to beremembered better. Thus, Figure S also shows18 Similar effects are obtained in vision e.g., Graham Nachmias, 1971.10 In the case of decisions or parallel signalling circuitssuch as may be involved in affective reactions, the minimal quorum is equivalent to a veto decision or its inverse.AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST  FEBRUARY 1980  171the representations in memory that are left by thethree processes affect, recognition, and featureidentification, To the extent that these traces areredundant, the likelihood of a later retrieval wouldbe facilitated.I began this paper with a quotation from Wundt,and it must be apparent that another spirit hasemerged as I have developed my argumentsthat of Freud. The separation of affect and cognition, the dominance and primacy of affectivereactions, and their ability to influence responseswhen ordinary perceptual recognition is at chancelevel are all very much in the spirit of Freud, thechampion of the unconscious. In terms of myformulation, there seem to be at least two differentforms of unconscious processes. One emergeswhere behavior, such as that occurring in discrimination among stimuli, is entirely under the influence of affective factors without the participationof cognitive processes. Included here are suchphenomena as perceptual defense and vigilance,subliminal perception and discrimination, state dependent recall, and mood and context effects. Another form of unconscious process is implicated inhighly overlearned, and thus automated, sequencesof information processing this form includes cognitive acts but has collapsed them into largermolar chunks that may conceal their original component links cf. Shiffrin  Schneider, 1977. Andthere may be other forms of process in which theseparation between affect and cognition preventsthe individual from apprehending the potentialconnection between them.Because the language of my paper has beenstronger than can be justified by the logic of theargument or the weight of the evidence, I hastento affirm that one of my purposes was to convinceyou that affect should not be treated as unalterably last and invariably postcognitive. The evolutionary origins of affective reactions that pointto their survival value, their distinctive freedomfrom attentive control, their speed, the importanceof affective discriminations for the individual, theextreme forms of action that affect can recruitall of these suggest something special about affect.People do not get married or divorced, commitmurder or suicide, or lay down their lives for freedom upon a detailed cognitive analysis of the prosand cons of their actions. If we stop to considerjust how much variance in the course of our livesis controlled by cognitive processes and how muchby affect, and how much the one and the otherinfluence the important outcomes in our lives, wecannot but agree that affective phenomena deservefar more attention than they have received fromcognitive psychologists and a closer cognitivescrutiny from social psychologists,REFERENCE NOTES1.
