UCSD AI Group Webpage People News Publications Artificial Intelligence Group The Artificial Intelligence Group at UCSD engages in a wide range of theoretical and experimental research. Areas of particular strength include machine learning, reasoning under uncertainty, and cognitive modeling. Within these areas, students and faculty also pursue real-world applications to problems in computer vision, speech and audio processing, data mining, bioinformatics, and computer security. The Artificial Intelligence Group is part of a larger campus-wide effort in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (COSMAL). Interdisciplinary collaborations are strongly supported and encouraged.
