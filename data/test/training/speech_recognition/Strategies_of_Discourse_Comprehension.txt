Strategies of Discourse ComprehensionTeun A. van DijkWalter Kintsch1983New York Academic PressGUATEMALA NO CHOICESCompared with the relative shades of gray in El Salvador, Guatemala is a,study in black and white. On the left is a collection of extreme MarxistLeninistgroups led by what one diplomat calls a pretty faceless bunch of people. Onthe right is an entrenched elite that has dominated Central Americas mostpopulous country since a CIAbacked coup deposed the reformist governmentof Col. Jacobo Arbenz Guzmn in 1954. Moderates of the political center.embattled but alive in E1 Salvador, have virtually disappeared in Guatemalajoining more than 30.000 victims of terror over the last tifteen vears. Thesituation in Guatemala is much more serious than in EI Salvador, declares oneLatin American diplomat. The oligarchy is that much more reactionary. and thechoices are far fewer. Zero The Guatemalan oligarchs hated Jimmy Carter for cutting off U.S.military aid in 1977 to protest humanrights abusesand the rightwingers hiredmarimba bands and set off firecrackers on the night Ronald Reagan was elected.They considered Reagan an ideological kinsman and believed they had a specialfriend in White House aide Michael Deaver, whose former PR firm hadrepresented a Guatemalan businessmens group, Los Amigos del Pas Friendsof the Country. But after a year of Reagan, the Guatemalans have beendisappointed. If Reagans team has proved friendlier than Carters, the persistentU.S. demands for political moderation continue to grate on the Guatemalans. Asone diplomat in the Guatemalan capital puts it. U.S. leverage on the regime iszero.Cold Shoulder The Guatemalans have snubbed visiting U.S. congressmen.calling some of them communists. They have even given the cold shoulder toReagans special emissary, Gen. Vernon Walters, who visited Guatemala twicelast year. On the first trip Guatemalas President Romeo Lucas Garcia finallyagreed to receive Walters at the last minute. On the second visit the Presidentsplane was preparing for takeoff just as Walterss landed. They feel they arewaging our war in Central America, and were not helping them. says oneAmerican in Guatemala. They say, Wed rather do it with youbut with you orwithout youwell do it.The government is certainly making every effort to do it. Guatemala hasacquired Brazilian armored vehicles and an array of arms and equipment fromFrance, Yugoslavia, South Korea and Romania. But the principal ,ourre ofweapons for the Lucas Garcia government appears to be Israel. The GuatemalanArmy is equipped with everything from Israelimade cartridge belts and helmetsto Galil assault rifles, Uzi submachine guns and araw transport planes. TheIsraelis are also reported to be training radioCopyright 1982 by Newsweek, Inc.

More than 13,000 people havebeen killed since 1978, and the State Department estimates that 300 more aremurdered each month. The morning papers are full of reported killings bydesconocidos unknowns. Most murders seem to be the work of rightwingdeath squads like the Secret AntiCommunist Army, widely assumed to becovert agents of the government. A U.S. missionary, John Arnold Miller, waskilled two weeks ago, the seventh cleric murdered in fourteen months. And inthe village of Uspantan last week 53 peasants were rounded up and beheaded.The government blamed guerrillas, but the evidence was skimpy. There are nopolitical prisoners in Guatemala, former Vice President Francisco VillagranKramer once remarked. Only political murders. Hydra The wholesale killing has not yet daunted the regimes guerrillaopponents. Earlier this month the four principal guerrilla groups announced theyhad joined in a Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity. Within hours ofthe declaration Guatemala City was almost blacked out by a series of bombblastsevidence that unification may work to the advantage of the estimated3,000 to 5,000 guerrillas. They may also be bolstered by assistance and trainingfrom Communistbloc countries. Last summer the government discovered morethan 25 guerrilla safe houses stocked with Chinese and Sovietbloc weapons,including a cache of U.S. M16 rifles whose serial numbers matched those leftbehind in Vietnam. In 1981 there were 383 reported clashes with guerrillasalmost four times as many as the year before. We have been able to pacifysome regions, says Col. Jaime Rabanales Reyes. But the guerrillas are like ahydratheir heads always show up in some other place.The choices facing the United States in Guatemala are few and unpleasant.Washington can hardly hope for a centrist political solution the same ChristianDemocrats the United States supports in El Salvador continue to be decimatedin Guatemala. In the last eighteen months 238 Christian Democratic leadershave disappeared. Some diplomats think the extreme right is destroying themoderate center precisely to preclude the sort of reformist solution that theUnited States advocates in El Salvador. Ultimately the polarization serves thecause of the leftist revolutionaries. The growing strength of the left conceivablycould persuade the United States to back yet another Central Americandictatorshipthis one, in Guatemala, the most brutal of them all.LARRY ROHTER in Guatemala CityStrategies of DiscourseComprehesionStrategies ofDiscourse ComprehensionTeun A. van DijkDepartment of General Literary StudiesSection of Discourse StudiesUniversity of AmsterdamAmsterdam, The NetherlandsWalter KihtschDepartment of PsychologyUnivcrsity of ColoradoBoulder, Colorado1983ACADEMIC PRESSA Subsidiary of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, PublishersNew York LondonParis San Diego San Francisco Sao Paulo Svdnev Tokyo TorontoCOPYRIGHT  1983, BY ACADEMIC PRESS, INC.

Historical BackgroundSeveral disciplines in the humanities and the social sciences have recentlyshown an increasing interest in the study of discourse. This development, whichreally began around 1970, is not without historical sources however. Over 2000years ago, classical poetics and rhetorics already provided structural models fortexts, such as poetry, drama, and legal or political discourse Wellek, 1955Wimsatt  Brooks, 1957 Lausberg, I960 Corbett, 1971. The conceptualsophistication of classical rhetorics remained unmatched until the developmentof structuralism in linguistics, poetics, and anthropology in the late 1960s, afterthe earlier example of the socalled Russian Formalists Erlich, 1955 and theCzech Structuralists between the world wars 1hwe, 1972 Culler, 1975. Thus,the work of the Russian anthropologist Vladimir Propp 1928 on the Russianfolktale provided an example for the structural approach to narratives which wastaken up more than 30 vears later, mainly in France, by anthropologists andliterary scholars such as LviStrauss, Barthes, Bremond, Todorov, Greimas, andothers, and which finally emerged within psychology, in the work on storygrammars Rumelhart, 1975 van Dijk, 1980a. Although these various classicaland structuralist theories do not meet the current methodological standards ofexplicitness in linguistics and psychology, many of the theoretical notionsremain relevant today.21.1.2. TextlinguisticsUntil the 1970s modern linguistics in America rarely looked beyond the sentence boundary. The prevailing generative transformational paradigm focused onphonological, morphological, syntactic, and later also semantic, structures of isolated, context and textindependent sentences, ignoring the early programmaticcall for discourse analysis by Harris 1952. Interest in the linguistic study ofdiscourse was restricted to less prominent linguistic schools, such as tagmemicsPike, 1967 Grimes, 1975 Longacre, 1976, which developed discourse analyticmethods mainly for descriptive field work on indigenous languages. Europeanlinguistics, especially in England and Germany had remained somewhat closer tothe structuralist tradition which had less respect for the boundaries of linguisticsitself in general, and of the sentence unit in particular Halliday, 1961Hartmann, 1964, 1968 Harweg, 1968 Petfi, 1971 van Dijk, 1972 Dressler,1972 Schmidt, 1973. Indeed, some of these linguistic studies of discourse wereat the boundaries of grammar, stylistics, and poetics Leech, 1966 Crystal Davy, 1969. Initially, the more theoretical claims and proposals based on theassumption that a grammar should also account for the systematic linguisticstructures of whole texts, thereby becoming a text grammar, remained in aprogrammatic stage, still too close to the generative paradigm for comfort. Soon,however, both text grammars and the linguistic study of discourse in generaldeveloped a more independent paradigm, finally spreading from Europe to theUnited States van Dijk, 1977a van Dijk  Petfi, 1977 Dressler, 1978 Sinclair Coulthard, 1975 Coulthard, 1977, and many other studies see de Beaugrande Dressler, 1981, and de Beaugrande, 1980, for a survey and introduction.More or less parallel with this development, American linguistics had itselfshown an increasing tendency toward text and contextdependent grammaticalanalysis, after the earlier tagmemic work, especially within socalled functionalparadigms Givon, 1979a.1.1.3. The Social Sciences and Discourse AnalysisThe study of discourse became relevant in particular as soon as it was recognized, also around 1970, that language studies should not be restricted to thegrammatical analysis of abstract or ideal language systems, but, rather, thatactual language use in the social context should be the empirical object oflinguistic theories. Thus, sociolinguistics not only became interested in the studyof social variation of language use, but also paid increasing attention to variousforms of language use, such as verbal dueling and storytelling Labov, 1972a,1972b.Some of this sociolinguistic work became intertwined with a similar development in anthropology and ethnography, where earlier structural analyses ofmyths, folktales, riddles, and other forms of verbal art gave way to a broaderanalysis of communicative events in various cultures Gumperz  Hymes, 1972Bauman  Sherzer, 1974 Sanches  Blount, 1975.3Finally, this general tendency toward a study of naturally occurring speechcould also be observed in microsociology, where the ethnomethodologicatattention paid to everyday interaction soon focused on conversational interactionas well Sudnow, 1972 Sacks, Schegloff,  Jefferson, 1974 Schenkein, 1978.In fact, conversation analysis soon became so popular that it virtually wasidentified with discourse analysis, and its influence in recent linguistics has beenconsiderable Franck, 1980 Coulthard  Montgomery, 1981.At the moment, it is hard to make strict disciplinary distinctions within thestudy of discourse, which seems to emerge more and more as an independent,interdisciplinary field, in which purely linguistic or grammatical methods andtheories mingle with those from ethnography, microsociology and, as we willsee, from psychology.l.l.4. Psychology and Artificial IntelligenceFollowing the prevailing generative transformational trend, psychology andpsycholinguistics were hesitant to recognize the relevance of discourse to thestudy of language processing. Early psycholinguistic models in the 1960s wererestricted the syntax and, later, the semantics, of isolated sentences Clark Clark. 1977 Fodor, Bever,  Garrett, 1974.Again, the early 1970s brought a breach in this paradigm. The growinginterest in semantic memory resulted in the use of discourse materials and thefirst steps toward a cognitive model of discourse understanding Kintsch, 1972.1974 Bower, 1974 for a survey of other work, see Chapter 2. At the same time,educational psychology realized that learning often takes place on the basis oftexts, which also contributed to the quickly developing interest in memory fordiscourse Rothkopf, 1972, Meyer, 1975. Thus, we witnessed in psychology ageneral revival of earlier work on discourse within the gestalt tradition, notablythat of Bartlett 1932, which had only occasionally inspired psychologistsduring the intervening 40 years Cofer, 1941 Gomulicki, 1956 Paul, 1959Slamecka, 1959 Pompi  Lachman, 1967.This revival, not only of discourse comprehension but also of various schematheories, took place in artificial intelligence as well. In this area, the year 1972brought a decisive paradigm shift Winograd, 1972 Charniak, 1972 Simmons,1972. The computersimulated understanding of language required the development of programs for the automatic processing of texts. Crucial to this researchwas the modeling of world knowledge necessary for the understanding of stories,for example. Thus, Bartletts notion of schema was taken up again in a moreexplicit fashion under such labels as schema, scenario, frame, and script,in order to account for the role of world knowledge representations in discourseunderstanding and other complex cognitive tasks Schank  Colby, 1973Minsky, 1975 Bobrow  Collins, 1975 Norman  Rumelhart, 1975 Schank Abelson, 1977.Ten years have elapsed since these early studies in linguistics, psychology,artificial intelligence, and the social sciences. Whereas the earlier approaches often4developed in a more or less autonomous and parallel way, we now witness anincreasing integration of the many theoretical proposals. Within the wide newfield of cognitive science, the interdisciplinary study of discourse has seen thepublication of numerous books and papers, the foundation of two specializedjournals Discourse Processing, 1978 Text, 1981, and the regular occurrence ofconferences or sessions within larger conferences. There have been numerousmutual contacts between linguistics and psychology, between linguistics andmicrosociology, and between psychology and ethnography.In our initial work on cognitive models for discourse comprehension Kintsch van Dijk, 1975, 1978 van Dijk  Kintsch, 1978 we attempted to integrateseveral proposals from these earlier approaches to discourse, in particular fromour own work in these areas. Thus, the general memory model was developedfrom previous work on semantic memory Kintsch, 1970, 1972, whereas thevarious textual structures, such as local and global coherence, macrostructures,and superstructures, were analyzed for their role in processing in terms of earliertextlinguistic work van Dijk, 1972, 1977a and its influence in psychologyKintsch, 1974.Although this interdisciplinarily inspired model of discourse comprehensionhas been steadily extended and refined over the past years, both by ourselvesand, often independently and into other directions, by others see the survey ofthis work in Chapter 2, the model presented in this book should be consideredboth as a further extension of this earlier work as well as a new direction in thecognitive modeling of discourse processing. Whereas our earlier model couldstill be characterized as predominantly structural, we now propose a moredynamic, processoriented, online model, an approach we want to callstrategical.1.2. BASIC ASSUMPTIONSHaving sketched some of the historical background of our model, we shallnow present an informal outline of its basic assumptions. These assumptions notonly inspire the major theoretical notions and components of the model, but alsoestablish the necessary relationships with other models of discourse use inlinguistics and the social sciences. In the next main section of this chapter wegive an overview of the major components of the model, which the followingchapters will systematically treat in further theoretical and experimental detail.1.2.1. Cognitive AssumptionsSuppose someone witnesses a car accident. We assume that such a personconstructs a mental representation of that accident, and that his or her understandingof the observed events consists in that process of construction and its memorialConsequences, Now, suppose that another person hears a story about the sameaccident. We assume that understanding such a story also involves the constructionof a mental representation of the story. Of course, a representation of the accident5Itself a representation of the story about the accident will not be identical. In thelatter case, we will have a representation of the speakers already coded versionof the accident Hrmann, 1976. But, the common characteristic of bothcognitive is that the person who witnesses the accident and the person wholistens to the story each constructs a representation in memory, on the basis ofthe visual and the linguistic data, respectively. We will call this the constructivistassumption of our model.Next, we will assume that both the witness of the accident and the listener ofthe accident story do not merely represent the visual and the verbal data, such asthe movements of objects or persons events or the sounds uttered when thestory is told, but also, or rather, an interpretation of the events and the utteranceLoftus, 1979. In both cases they construct a meaning The events areinterpreted as an accident and the story utterance is interpreted as a story aboutan accident. We will call this the interpretative assumption of the model. In fact,we will be nearly exclusively dealing with this semantic aspect of discourseprocessing.We will further assume that the construction of a representation of theaccident or the accident story, and in particular of the meaning of the input data,takes place more or less at the same time as the processing of the input data. Inother words, we assume that the witness and the listener in our example do notfirst and store all input data of the respective events. and only afterward try toassign meaning to these. That is, understanding takes place online with the processing of input data, gradually, and not post hoc. Using the computer metaphor,we will call this the online assumption of discourse processing MarslenWilson Tyler 1980.Persons who understand real events or speech events are able to construct amental representation, and especially a meaningful representation, only if theyhave more general knowledge about such events. In order to interpret someevents as an accident, they must know something about the usual traffic eventsand actions in oich cars and drivers are involved, and for stories they must havemore general ledge about stories and about their relationship to the events thatthey tell of. Similarly, the two persons may interpret the events in the light ofprevious experiences with similar events, experiences that may have led to themore general knowledge about them. In addition to this knowledge, the listenerand the witness may have other cognitive information, such as beliefs, opinions,or attitudes regarding auch events in general, or motivations, goals, or specifictasks in the processing of these events. More generally, then, we will assume thatunderstanding involves only the processing and interpretation of external data,but also the activation and use of internal, cognitive, information. Since thisinformation can be considered as cognitive presuppositions of the constructionprocess, we will call this the presuppositional assumption of the model.As we will see in somewhat more detail in what follows,accidents and stories will not simply be observed and understood inrucmo, hut as parts of more complex situations or social contexts.Understanding them therefore also means that the person uses orconstructs information about the relationships between the events and6their situations. That is, the understander now has three kinds of data, namely,information from the events themselves, information from the situation orcontext, and information from the cognitive presuppositions. This informationmay be combined in an effective way, such that a mental representation of theevent is constructed as soon as possible and as well as meaningfully, usefully,etc.  as possible. This may mean, for instance, that the observer of an accidenteven constructs meanings derived from his or her presuppositional informationfor which the external data are lacking, and the same is true for the listener of thestory He or she may have expectations about what may be told before actuallyhaving heard it, and this may facilitate the understanding process when he or sheactually does get the relevant external information. There is no fixed order, ateach point, between input data and their interpretation Interpretations may beconstructed and only later matched with input data. We see that persons have theability to flexibly make use of various kinds of information, that the informationmay be processed in several possible orders, that the information that isinterpreted can be incomplete, and that the overall goal ofthe process is to be aseffective as possible in the construction of the mental representation. We willcall this the strategic assumption of the model. Whereas the other assumptionshave already received due attention in previous discourseprocessino models,this strategic assumption will be the focus of the present book. We will see that itis inextricably linked with the other assumptions, especially With the onlineassumption about complex information processing of events and discourses.We can now conclude that the major dimensions of our model are based onthe assumption that discourse processing, just like other complex informationprocessing, is a strategic process in which a mental representation is constructedof the discourse in memory, using both external and internal types ofinformation, with the goal of interpreting understanding the discourse. Ofcourse, these very general assumptions have many corollaries and implications.Thus, the constructivist assumption has as an important corollary that gradual,online, construction is possible only on the basis of a structural analysis andsynthesis process, in which, at various levels, meaningful units can bedistinguished, as can wavs in which these units can be combined into morecomplex units. This and other corollaries and implications of our assumptionswill be spelled out in the appropriate chapters of this book.1.2.2. Contextual AssumptionsWe already suggested that discourses such as stories do not occur illrucuo. They are produced and received, by speakers and listeners, inspecific situations within a wider sociocultural context. Hence, discourseprocessing is not merely a cognitive event, but also a social event. This isobvious, of course, but here we will assume, first of all, that the socialdimensions of discourse interact with the cognitive ones. In other words,the cognitive model should also provide for the fact that discourse, andhence the process of understanding a discourse, is functional in the7social context. We will call this the social functionality assumption. The firstcognitive implication of this assumption is that language users construct arepresentian not only of the text but also of the social context, and that these tworepresenaions interact.More specifically, we assume that a story about an accident is told and understood in a process of communication, in which a listener acquires informationfrom the speaker, in this case about some accident and about the way thespeaker has coded this accident in his or her memory. This communicativeassumption may mean, among other things, that the listener does not merelyattempt to construct his or her own representation of the story, but matches thisinterpretation with a representation of the assumptions about what the speakerintended the listener to understand.Because intentions are involved in discourse, we deal not only with linguisticobjects, but also with the results of some form of social action. Thus, whentelling a story a speaker will engage in the social act, a speech act, of assertingsomething, or Amning the listener about something. The form and theinterpretation of the story wuv be a function of this intended speech act functionof the utterance act. We will call this the pragmatic assumption of a model ofdiscourse processing. The cognitive implication of this assumption is, forinstance, that a person who interprets a story will also construct a representationof the possible speech acts involved, by msigning a specific function or actioncategory to the discourse utterance, and hence to the speaker. In this case, thelistener will evaluate the discourse on a number of points relative to the intendedpragmatic functions This story may be pragmatically appropriate as a speech actonly if some contextual conditions match with some textual properties.Next, it should be assumed that the interpretation of a discourse as a specificspeech act or series of speech acts is embedded within an interpretation of thewhole interaction process taking place between the speech participants. Both thespeaker and the listener will have motivations, purposes, or intentions whenengaging in verbal interaction, and the same holds for the further actions withwhich the verbal actions are related in the same situation. Hence, the pragmaticassumption should be generalized to an interactionist assumption. Again, thismeans that we ussume that language users construct a cognitive representation ofthe verbal and nonverbal interaction taking place in the situation. This wouldimply, for instance, that the representation of the discourse in memory willdepend on the assumptions of the listener about the purposes goals and furtherunderlying motivations of the ,peaker, as well as on the listeners own goals andmotivations when listening to a story.Finally, as we have already suggested, the interaction in which theprocessing of discourse is embedded is itself part of a social situation.The speech participants may have certain functions or roles there maybe differences in location or setting and there may be specific rules,conventions, or strategies governing possible interactions in such asituation. One cannot say just anything in any situation Possibleactions, hence possible goals and hence possible discourses, are con8strained by the various dimensions of the situation. The accident story may betold in a bar, to a friend at home, or perhaps to a stranger on the bus, but wouldnot be a permissible speech act during an exam. In order to be able to understanda story. therefore, we have to link its pragmatic function with the generalintcractional constraints as determined by, or as determining, the social situationand this is possible only if, again, we specify in our model how the socialsituation is cognitively represented. In more concrete terms The interpretation ofthe meaning and the functions of the accident story will be different when told ininformal contexts to our friends than when told, by a witness, in a court trialrelated to the accident. Hence, we will ultimately have to take into account a.simaiunnl assumption about discourse processing. This may include, aspresuppositions, general norms and values, attitudes, and conventions about theparticipants and the interactions ill some situation.It goes without saying that these various contextual assumptions about discourse processing can be independently formulated within sociological modelsof language use. Yet, our general functional assumption suggests that the processof understanding also involves these various kinds of contextual information,that representations are constructed of the speech act, the communicativeinteractions, and the whole situation, and that these representations willstrategically interact with the understanding of the discourse itself. Hence,understanding is no longer a mere passive construction of a representation of averbal object, but part of an interactive process in which a listener interprets,actively, the actions of a speaker.It will not be our main task to investigate the nature of the representationsand the interpretation processes of such contextual information, but we will takethem into account when formulating the processes of discourse understanding.1.2.3. LimitationsWe cannot possibly investigate the details of all assumptions set forth.Hence. against the background of the more general assumptions defining thebasis of the model, we will specify only some of its components. Although wepresent some general ideas about the ways these various components of themodel interact, we will assume that the components can be spelled out more orless independently Simon, 1969. The three major limitations of our model aretherefore the following1. Linguistic parsing We do not fully model the processes by whichlinguistic input is analyzed or synthesized and semantically interpreted for themost part, we limit the model to the processing of semantic information.2. Knowledtge representation and use We will not completely spell out theknowledge baseor other cognitive information, such as beliefs or opinions,tasks, and goalswhich provides the information necessary for the varioussemantic operations of discourse understanding knowledge specified will be adhoc and intuitive, and we will only focus on some aspects of the processes ofknowledge use.93. We will also neglect the systematic representation of contextual informnation in discourse processing, such as relevant speech acts, interaction, andsituation again, this information will be provided ad hoc when necessary in theformulation of semantic processes.Since we formulate more or less general hypotheses about the relationshipsbetween our semantic component and the other components, and because atcertain points we do specify in detail how the components interact, we hope thatthe formulation of the principles of the semantic model is sufficientlyconstrained by the implications of the other components.In addition to its theoretical incompleteness, the model also has a number ofmore empirical limitations. We have been talking so far about discourseprocessing in general, using the example of story comprehension. However,discourse processing also involves participating in a conversation, skimming thenewspaper, giving a lecture, reading a textbook, or writing a police report.Hence, we have provisionally assumed that principles of discourse processingcan be formulated at a level that encompasses these various discourse types.Obviously, each discourse type will involve linguistic and cognitive differences,but we will only occasionally take these into account.Furthermore, the language users involved may be very different. They mayhave different knowledge, beliefs, and opinions, have different social roles, theymay be children or adults, male or female, have a different education, and so on.Again, we will for the moment abstract from these differences, and hope toprovide a framework within which they can easily be filled in.Finally, there are also different kinds, styles, or modes of comprehension. Wehave noted the possibility of skimming a newspaper story. On the other hand, wemay also actively study or even learn by heart some part of a textbook, we mayread a text with much or with little attention, we may be distracted by othercontextual information or not, and so on. We will also abstract from thesedifferences, and act as if the language user processes all information, constructs acomplete representation, and stops the construction of the representation as soonas it satisfies a number uf conditions, for example, those of local and globalmacrostructural coherence. However, our strategic approach would expresslyprovide for the possibility that language users often do process informationincompletely or incorrectly and yet feel that they understand the text. Similarly,we limit the model to an account of proper semantic understanding. We havealready stressed that understanding of the pragmatic or interactional aspects ofthe discourse will not be fully spelled out, but this also involves neglecting otherpersonal relationships or experiences of the listener, as well as the listenerssocial or ideological understanding of the discourse or the understanding of theperson producing the discourse, which would involve attributing variousmotivational or personality structures.There is no unitary process of comprehension, but variable comprehensionprocesses in different situations, of different language users, of different discoursetypes. We will assume, though, that our model is general and flexible enough toallow later specification of these various differences. In the following we will not10apologize for the theoretical or empirical incompleteness or limitations of ourmodel every time this excuse would be relevant. Nor do we want to stress at cachpoint that the comprehension process we model is rather idealistic. Thelimitations spelled out in this section should be considered as the boundaryconditions for the model throughout this book.1.3. AN OVERVIEW OF THE MODEL1.3.1. General PropertiesMany models of language and language use, both in linguistics and inpsychology, account for linguistic objects in terms of the levels ofmorphonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Although such a levelbylevel description may be relevant in a more abstract analysis, it does not seemParticularly relevant from the point of view of processing models. One of themajor assumptions has been that in a cognitive model of discourse understandingand production. information from these various levels interacts in an intricateway. Thus, semantic interpretation does not simply follow full syntactic analysis,but may already occur with an incomplete surface structure input, whereasfurther syntactic analysis may use information from the semantic and pragmaticlevels. Although we will certainly make use of different kinds of information,such as syntactic units or semantic units, our model operates on more complexchunks. Thus, we will analyze discourse processing from the word units on thelower level, up to the unit of overall themes or macrostructures. For theunderstanding and integration of these different units, various kinds ofinformation may be used. In this way, we may use words, perhaps thematicwords, in order to construct macrostructures, and we may use macrostructures inthe understanding of words.Our model is not level oriented but complexity oriented We go from theunderstanding of words, to the understanding of clauses in which these wordshave various functions, and then to complex sentences, sequences of sentences,and overall textual structures. But even so there is continual feedback betweenless complex and more complex units Understanding the function of a word in aclause will depend on the functional structure of the clause as a whole, both atthe syntactic and at the semantic level. This means that instead of a conventionalstructural model of processing, we operate with a strategic model.The notion of comprehension strategy was introduced in 1970 by Bever inthe context of sentence processing. Several other researchers have employed thenotion since then, but it did not receive the central role we would like to reservefor it in our model. Earlier notions of strategy were often restricted to particularlevels, such as syntactic analysis. We would like to extend the notion, first of all,from the sentence level to the discourse level. Second, we want to use it forprocessing across several levels of the discourse input, as well as for both textualand contextual information. and for both external and internal information.11Strategic processes contrast with algorithmic, rulegoverned processes. Anexample of the latter is a generative grammar, which produces a structuraldescription of a sentence by syntactic parsing rules. This process may becomplex, long and tedious, but it guarantees success as long as the rules arecorrect and are applied wemly. In a strategic process, there is no such guaranteedsuccess and no unique representation of the text. The strategies applied are likeeffective working hypotheses about the correct structure and meaning of a textfragment, and these may be disconfirmed by further processing. Also, strategicanalysis depends not only on textual characteristics, but also on characteristics ofthe language user, such as his or her goals or world knowledge. This may meanthat a reader of a text will try to reconstruct not only the intended meaning of thetext as signaled by the writer in various ways in the text or contextbut also ameaning that is most relevant to his or her own interests and goals.Strategies are pan of our general knowledge they represent the proceduralknowledge we have about understanding discourse. They are an open set. Theyneed to be learned, and overlearned, before they can become automatized. Newtypes hus of discourse and forms of communication may require thedevelopment of strategies. Whereas some of the strategies, such as those of wordand clause comprehension, are acquired at a relatively early age, others, such asthose of gist inferring, are acquired rather late. Some strategies, such as theschematic strategies of understanding the structure of psychological articles, mayonly be acquired with sperial training.Formally, strategies can be represented as productions Newell, 1973. Ifcertain conditions are satisfied, a certain action is to be taken. Such conditionswill often involve a combination of information from various sources. In Chapter3, we will discuss this notion of strategy in more detail.The overall strategy, which we will decompose into a series of more specificstrategies, to be studied in the appropriate chapters of this book, has as its goalthe construction of a textbasc. Such a textbase is the semantic representation ofthe input discourse in episodic memory. This overall strategy of constructing atextbase va successful for a language user as soon as the textbase satisfies anumber of minimal criteria, such as those of local and global coherence. Itfollows that two major substrategies consist in the establishment of this kind oflocal and global coherence.Textbases will be defined in terms of propusirions and relations amongpropositions. Although there are other, formally equivalent, ways to representmeaning, ve will follow this wellknown representation format, borrowed fromlinguistics and philosophy. However, we will assign more structure topropositions than has been usual in logic, following functionalist proposals fromlinguistics Fillmore, 1968 Dik, 1978, 1980 Givn, 1979b.A major feature of our model is the assumption that discourse understandinginvolves not only the representation of a textbase in episodic memory, but, at theaame time, the activation, updating, and other uses of a socalled situation model inepisodic memory this is the cognitive representation of the events, actions, per12sons, and in general the situation, a text is about. Once again, there are historicalprecedents for such a notion e.g., JohnsonLaird, 1980.A situation model may incorporate previous experiences, and hence also previous textbases, regarding the same or similar situations. At the same time, themodel may incorporate instantiations from more general knowledge fromsemantic memory about such situations. In Chapter 10 we will give a number ofarguments for this kind of double representation in episodic memory. If in thefollowing chapters we specify the strategics used in the construction of asemantic textbase in episodic memory, it is understood that this representation iscontinually matched with what we already know about similar situations, thatis, with the episodic model. This process is important, because it allows us tolimit a textbase to information expressed or implied by the text itself, withouthaving to interpolate into it large amounts of activated knowledge. This episodicand semantic knowledge will be assumed to be integrated into the more completesituation model with which the textbase is continuously compared. This meansthat understanding is restricted to an evaluation of the textbase not only withrespect to local and global coherence, but also with respect to its correspondingsituation model. In this way, we know not only what the text meansconceptually, but also what it is about referentially. In other words, here we areintroducing into cognitive psychology the wellknown distinction in philosophybetween intensional meaning semantics and extensional referential semantics.One obvious advantage of the presence of situation models is the possibility forthe language user to assign such fundamental notions as truth and falsity todiscourses.Another general property of the model is its overall control system. Forthe processing of each discourse, this control system is fed by specificgeneral information about the type of situation, type of discourse, overallgoals luf the readerlistener and of the writerspeaker, by the schematicsuperstructure and the macrostructures gist, themes of the text, or by plansin the case of production. This control system will supervise processing inshortterm memory, activate and actualize needed episodic and more generalsemantic knowledge, provide the higher order information into which lowerorder information must fit, coordinate the various strategies, decide whichinformation from shortterm memory should he moved to episodic memory,activate the relevant situation models in episodic memory, guide effectivesearch of relevant information in longterm memory, and so on. The controlsystem guarantees that all strategies are geared toward producing information, such as semantic representations but also pragmatic and otherinteractional and contextual representations, that is consistent with theoverall goals of understanding. The control system incorporates all theinformation that is needed for processing in shortterm memory but that theshortterm buffer need not and cannot itself keep in store at each step. Usingthe compartmental metaphor for the modeling of memory, we will assumethat this control system has a specific localization in episodic memory ifwe do not want to speak of a more or less sepalate control memory suchthat its information is accessible both to shortterm memory and longtermmemory processes. In Chapter 10 we will be more specific about these13Various functions of the memory stores, but we assume throughout thatstrategies operate under the general monitoring of the control system.Finally, the model crucially involves large amounts of knowledge, both episodic and more general and abstract knowledge as represented in semanticmemory. We will assume that fast access and effective retrieval of thisknowledge is vital for strategic discourse comprehension, and that such effectiveretrieval is possible only if knowledge is well organized, for example, accordingto the many schemalike proposals made in artificial intelligence and variouspsychological theories in the last few years. However, as already mentioned, wewill not present a complete representation format for knowledge. On the whole,we will assume that there are various forms of organization, but that these formsare more flexible than rigid trames or scripts. For our purposes, then, we will payspecial attention to the strategies of knowledge use. Instead of a more or lessblind activation of all possible knowledge, in the understanding of a word, aclause, or the construction of a global theme, we assume that the use ofknowledge is strategic, depending on the goals of the language user, the amountof available knowledge from text and context, the level of processing or thedegree of coherence needed for comprehension, which are criteria for strategicknowledge use monitored by the control system. Details of these strategies aregiven in Chapter 9, but again the following chapters will presuppose a permanentflow of knowledge between longterm memory and shortterm memory in orderto support the specific comprehension strategies.What has been said for knowledge also is assumed to hold for other presupposed cognitive information, such as beliefs, opinions, and attitudes. Again, wedo not propose any concrete representation models, but it is obvious that mostdiscourse understanding will involve personal beliefs and evaluations. Withoutthese, certain kinds of local and global coherence might not be established at allbecause they may presuppose personally held beliefs e.g., about causality oropinions. Further work on discourse processing will have to take into account therole of these kinds of hot cognition Abelson, 1979 Carbonell, 1978 van Dijk,1982a Wegman, 1981.Within the framework of these more general properties of our model, we cannow summarize its various components.1.3.2. Propositional StrategiesThe first step of our semantic model involves the strategic construction ofpropositions. This step, of course, presupposes surface structural decoding ofphonetic or graphical strings, the identification of phonemes letters, and theconstruction of morphemes, but we will not provide an account of these purelysurface strategies. For our purposes, it is sufficient to stress that word recognitionstrategically depends on underlying semantic interpretation, generatingexpectations about possible meanings, and hence possible word classes, as wellas on the overall syntactic structure of the clause. For further details about theseprocesses, see Chapter 2.14Propositions, then, are constructed in our model on the basis of word meanings, activated from semantic memory, and syntactic structures of clauses. Inprinciple, we will assume that there is a strategic onetoone relationshipbetween propositions and clauses One clause expresses one proposition. Thismeans, however, that our propositions must be complex, according to the usualmodels from logic or philosophy. Word meanings will usually correspond towhat is called an atomic proposition. A oneclause sentence like l  The Fascists have won the elections in El Salvador.would be analyzed into the following atomic propositions2 i FASCISTSx1ii HAVE WON xl, x2iii ELECTIONS x2iv IN x,2,x3v EL SALVADOR x3However, a linguistically and cognitively adequate representation of the meaning of1 cannot be rendered by the listor a conjunction of the atomic propositionsin 2.The respective concepts or atomic propositions have complex relational structures, orroles, in which words like, fascists have the role of agents, as is signaled by firstposition occurrence and grammatical subject in syntactic structure. Hence, weassume that these atomic propositions are organized in a propositional schema,involving these structural relations or functions. Such a schema is a strategical unitIt allows a fast analysis of surface structures into a relatively fixed and simplesemantic configuration. Thus, a first occurrence grammatical subject noun, or apronoun, when denoting a person, will be strategically assigned the agentposition in such a schema, even before the rest of the clause has been analyzed.Similarly, complex sentences will be analyzed as complex propositionalschemata, in which propositions may be coordinated or mutually embeddedunder the relevant functional category. In this case, again, surface ordering andhierarchy of clauses will be strategical indications for the ultimate organizationof these complex propositional schemata, although other semantic information,for example, from previous sentences or the overall macrostructure, may assign adifferent structure to the semantic representation of the sentence. In Chapter 4 wewill discuss a number of strategies used in this kind of clause and sentenceinterpretation within texts and contexts.1.3.3. Local Coherence StrategiesWhereas most sentencebased psycholinguistic models of language understanding will stop at this point, our discourse processing model has as its next taskthe establishment of meaningful connections between successive sentences in adiscourse. We summarize the set of strategies involved here under the more generalheading of local coherence strategies. That is, we assume that the major task of15understanding at this point is the construction of local coherence. The mainabstract condition on local coherence is that the complex propositions, expressedby the respective clauses or sentences, denote facts of some possible world thatare related, conditionally or by inclusion van Dijk, 1977a. Hence, in a cognitivemodel, the atrategic establishment of local coherence requires that the languageuser search as effectively as possible for potential links among facts denoted bythe proposition. Often facts thus related feature identical referents, namely,individual objects or persons. One possible strategy, therefore, is to look forthose arguments in a proposition which corefer with one of the arguments of theprevious proposition. The argument repetition strategy of our previous workKintsch, 1974 Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978 essentially attempted to capture thisstrategy. But it is only one possible aspect of a more complex local coherencestrategy, which requires that whole propositions, and hence whole facts, beconnected. Clause ordering, explicit connectives, and knowledge from longtermmemory will provide the means of deciding this overall connection between thepropositions.The establishment of local coherence takes place in shortterm memory underthe general monitoring of the control system, and hence under the scope of amacroproposition. In our previous discourseprocessing model Kintsch  vanDijk, 1978 we assumed that local coherence establishment took place after thecomplete processing of the clauses or sentences involved. The present strategicmodel, however, tries to account for the plausible assumption that language usersestablish coherence as soon as possible, without waiting for the rest of the clauseor sentence. They immediately attempt to link, by coreference, for instance. firstnoun phrases, and hence underlying concepts atomic propositions, with relatedconcepts in the previous proposition, according to the information from thefunctional structure of the previous proposition, the topiccomment structure inthe subsequent clauses see Givon, 1979b, or the provisionally assumed role ofthe concept in the currently processed clause. In Chapter 5 we will formulate anumber of these local coherence strategies and report some relevant experimentalresults.1.3.4. MacrostrategiesA central component of our model is a set of macrostrategies. Such strategiesinfer macropropositions, of the same structure as the propositions mentioned earlier, from the sequence of propositions expressed, locally, by the text. Macropropositions may again, in a similar strategic way, be connected into sequences.Moreover, by reapplying the relevant inference strategics, we may have severallevels of macropropositions, together forming the macrostructure of a text. Sucha macrostructure is the theoretical account of what we usually call the gist, theupshot, the theme, or the topic, of a text.In contrast to the abstract macrorules as defined in our earlier work van Dijk,1977a, 1980b Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978, macrostrategies are flexible and havea heuristic character. A language user need not wait until the end of a paragraph,chapter, or whole discourse before being able to infer what the text or the text16fragment is about, globally speaking. In other words, it is plausible that with aminimum of textual information from the first propositions, the language user willmake guesses about such a topic. These guesses will be sustained by various kindsof information, such as titles, thematic words, thematic first sentences, knowledgeabout possible ensuing global events or actions, and information from the context.Again we see that an expedient strategy will operate on many kinds of information,which individually are incomplete or insufficient to make the relevant hypotheticalassumption. In Chapter 6 we will discuss some of these macrostrategies.1.3.5. Schematic StrategiesMany discourse types seem to exhibit a conventional, and hence culturallyvariable, schematic structure, an overall form that organizes the inacropropositionsthe global content of the text. Thus, stories are usually assigned a narrativeschema, consisting of a hierarchical structure of conventional categories, such asSetting Complication, and Resolution. Argumentations and psychologicalresearch reports also have their own schemata. Such schemata we will call thescaper.ctructure of the text, because the term schema is too general and toovague for our purpose. A superstructure provides the overall syntax for theglobal meaning the macrostructure, of the text.Language users manipulate superstructures in a strategic way. They will tryto activate a relevant superstructure from semantic memory as soon as thecontext or the type of text suggests a first cue. From then on, the schema may beused as a powerful topdown processing device for the assignment of relevantsuperstructure categories global functions to each macropropositionorsequences of macropropositionsand will at the same time provide some generalconstraints upon the possible local and global meanings of the textbase. InChapter 7 some of these strategies will be studied in more detail. There it willalso be shown that they cannot simply be reduced to local or even globalsemantic strategies for the processing of information about human action, as hasbeen proposed by several researchers in artificial intelligence.1.3.6. Production StrategiesAlthough our model is mainly concerned with discourse comprehension, acomplete discourseprocessing model should also include a production component.In an abstract discourse theory it does not matter whether the structures arespecified by analysis or synthesis, because rules can be formulated both waysas mappings between semantic representations and surface structureexpressions and their ordering. In a cognitive model, however, and especiallyin a strategic model, we cannot simply invert the direction of the mapping.At each point of the comprehension of the production process, the listenerand the speaker have access to different kinds of information, so that therelevant strategies will also be different. To wit, a reader or listener willhave to figure out in complex ways what the topic of the discourse is,17Whereas the speaker in many cases, except in some forms of spontaneousconversation, already knows the topic of the discourse to be produced.Hence, the major task for a speaker is the construction of such amacrostructure as a semantic discourse plan, composed of elements from generalknowledge and, especially, from elements of the situation model including amodel of the hearerand his or her knowledge, motivations, past actions, andintentionsand of the conunicative context. With this macroplan, the next maintask is to strategically execute, at the local and linear level, the textbase,choosing between explicit and wiit information, establishing but alsoappropriately signaling local coherence, and finally formulating surfacestructures with the various semantic, pragmatic, and contextual data ascontrolling input. In accordance with the nature of the comprehencion strategies,we will also have to assume here that local proposition woation and local surfacestructure formulation do not come after the formation of semanticmacrostructures or local propositions, respectively. Speakers will probably startto formulate sentences before the full semantic representation of the sentence hasbeen formed, and the same will hold at the more global level, so that partial orpreviously formed macrostructures may be changed due to local informanconstraints. This will especially be the case in conversation and in thosemonologues which involve contextual feedback from hearers, or parallelobservation of ongoing events or actions.At present we know very little about specific production strategies. However,although these operations and their ordering will be different from those used incomprehension, it does not seem plausible that language users have twocompletely different and independent systems of strategies. This would even beinconsistent with our general assumption that understanding is not purely passiveanalysis, but a naructive process. Thus, the important role of topdown processingin understanding also involves partial planning of expectations about structuresand meanings of sentences and whole texts. Without entering into much detail, inChapter 8 we will sketch some of the strategic features of a production model.Such a model will at the same time account for the reproduction dimension ofdiscourse processing as in retrieving textual information in recall tasks.1.3.7. Other StrategiesAlthough we have discussed some major types of strategy in discourse comprehension, these are certainly not the only ones. Both in production and in comprehension we also have a number of stylistic strategies. These allow languageusers to make strategic options between alternative ways of expressing more orless the same meaning or denoting the same referent, under the controllingscope of text type and context information type of situation, degree ofinformality, categories of speech participants, and overall goals. Thus, alanguage user will also have the task of establishing some form of stylisticcoherence, selecting or interpreting words from the same register andindicators of the same personal or social situation. For a listener, thismeans in particular the strategic use of stylistic markers to infer many18properties of the speaker or the social context, such as anger, love, cooperation,dominance, or class membership, information that is vital for successfulinteraction Sandell, 1977.Similarly, we may distinguish rhetorical strategies, in both the productionand the comprehension of rhetorical structures figures of speech, among others.Whereas the main function of stylistic variation is to signal relations between thediscourse and the personal and social context of speaking, rhetorical structuresare used to enhance the effectiveness of the discourse and the communicativeinteraction. Hence, they are strategic by definition because they are only used tobetter realize the goals of the verbal interaction, such as comprehension,acceptance of the discourse, and successfulness of the speech act.As such, they do not lead to the construction of semantic representation, butthey help in this process. Figures of speech may attract attention to importantconcepts, provide more cues for local and global coherence, suggest plausiblepragmatic interpretations e.g., a promise versus a threat, and will in generalassign more structure to elements of the semantic representation, so that retrievalis easier. Parallel to the proper verbal interaction that they accomplish whenuttering a discourse, language users also have to strategically process nonverbalinformation, such as gestures, facial expressions, proximity, body positions, andso on. Again, these will seldom lead independently to semantic representations intheir own right such as an angry face implies The speaker is angry, but willin general facilitate the strategies of discourse understanding and production.Gestures and facial expressions will suggest which speech act is involved, whichfurther semantic implications should be drawn from local propositions, which arethe referents of deictic expressions MarslenWilson, Levy,  Tyler, 1982, andwhat concepts should be specially attended to, all of which again are markers ofpossible macrostructures. That is, the properties of nonverbal interaction provideimportant information for nearly all strategies that we will discuss in this book,as well as for the strategies of interaction in general Goffman, 1967, 1969Kendon, flarris,  Key, 1975 Kendon, 1981 Scherer  Ekman, 1982.These strategies are relevant especially in dyadic discourse types, such aseveryday conversations. Both at the textual and the paratextual nonverbal level,therefore, there will be a set of specific conversational strategies, includingmoves involving the social and interactional functions of discourse units, such asspeech acts or propositions. The system of turn taking, usually formulated interms of rules, would in a cognitive model require reformulation in terms ofexpedient strategies of participants in the allocation and appropriation of speakerturns. Besides information from the ongoing utterance, such as syntacticboundary signals or semantic closure of complex propositions, such turntakingstrategies would involve nonverbal information such as direction of gaze,gestures, pauses, or concomitant actions of the participants, in combination withmore general social properties of participants and the specific context who hasthe rightand the powerto keep or take the floor see Sudnow, 1972 Sacks,Schegloff,  Jefferson. 1974 Schenkein, 1978 Franck, 1980.l he stylistic, rhetorical, nonverbal, and conversational or other interactionalICgies briefly mentioned here cannot be treated in this book. It is obvious,.wver, that at many points they run parallel to or add to the strategies we do19The stylistic, rhetorical, nonverbal, and conversational or other interactionalstrategies briefly mentioned here cannot be treated in this book. It is obvious,however, that a many points they run parallel to or add to the strategies we dodiscuss, especially because they make semantic interpretation more effective.Due to disambiguation, or marking of personal motivations and intentions ofspeakers, for example, they help to establish the function of the discourse withinthe interactional context or the adequate performance and comprehension ofspeech acts. Current work, especially in nonverbal interaction and conversation,should therefore be reformulated from the perspective of a strategic cognitivemodel, so that out has been analyzed in a more structural way, or what has beenalready done on interactional strategies, can be given a solid cognitive basis.1.4. CONCLUSIONSThis chapter has sketched the interdisciplinary backgrounds as well as themajor assumptions of our model. It outlines the macrostructure of this book,namely, the various components of a strategic approach to discourse processing.However, it also stresses what the model cannot and will not spell out at themoment, such as surface structure parsing and full knowledge representation.Furthermore, it suggests many ways in which the model could be and should beextended in the future the role of beliefs, opinions, and attitudes the nature andthe role of stylistic, rhetorical, conversational, and interactional strategies and,in general, the embedding of the model into a broader model of strategic verbalinteraction in the social context. On the other hand, we have briefly suggestedhow such a social model should at the same time have a cognitive basis, forexample, by representing social contexts, situations, participants, andinteractions in the cognitive model we propose. lndeed, the strategies weformulate for the semantic interpretation of discourse may well be goodexamples for a further theory about the understanding, the planning, and hencethe participation in interaction. Whereas there is still a theoretical gap between alinguistic theory of language and discourse, on the one hand, and a theory ofsocial interaction on the other, our cognitive model provides a potential inkbetween these two theories. Since we translate abstract textual structures intomore concrete, online, cognitive processes of a strategic nature, and at the samenme would do so for the abstract structures of interaction and social situations,we are able to combine them in a complex way into a model of discourseinteraction. Filling in these programmatic statements is, of course, a nontrivialtask and a challenge for the future development of an interdisciplinary cognitivescience.Chapter 2Observations on the Status ofExperimental Research onDiscourse ComprehensionA thorough, comprehensive review and evaluation of the rapidly expandingarch on discourse processing would take us too far away from the main concernshis book. Instead, we shall try to present here a highly selective and biased ew.We want to make some points that are important for the understanding of matterson which this book will be focused, and we want to examine some of the iils ofthe psychological background from which our work derives. Thus, we shalldiscuss the research on discourse comprehension as we see it from the vantage itof our own work, and emphasize those trends that we perceive to be importantproviding a perspective on that work, either in terms of historical antecedentsparallels or as contrasts.2.1 PERCEPTUAL PROCESSESLETTER AND WORD IDENTIFICATIONAlthough our own model completely neglects the perceptual components ofthe iprehension process, we need to make a few remarks about the research inthis area. It is a comparatively welldeveloped field of research, with a richempirical t base and a history of instructive theoretical controversies. Some ofthe probs that we shall be concerned with later on have wellstudied analogues atthis level. The theoretical framework developed in these studies of letteridentification word recognition also forms the basis for our approach to higherlevel comiension processes.222.1.1. Topdown EffectsThe most basic result that is of importance for us here is that the perceptionof letters is influenced by our knowledge about words that the recognition ofwords is influenced by the sentence context in which they are presented and thatsentence processing itself is determined by the status of the sentence in a text, aswe shall see later. Thus, reading is not simply a sequence of processes startingwith feature detection and letter identification, and continuing through wordrecognition and sentence parsing to more global discourse processing. Instead ofa sequence of bottomup processing, we have a situation in which higher levelprocesses affect the lower ones that is, we have topdown effects with which tocontend. This situation is far from simple, and we shall have to analyze moreclosely the evidence for the claims just made and the theoretical models thathave been proposed to grapple with all this complexity.Nearly a hundred years ago Cattell  1886 observed that when letter stringswere presented on a tachistoscope, subjects were able to report more letters whenthe letters formed a word than when they did not. Although these results werereplicated many times Huey, 1908, their implications were never quite clear.Since subjects in these experiments had to report whole letter strings, it ispossible that the effects which were observed so reliably had nothing to do withperception per se, but could be ascribed to postperceptual processes. Althoughsubjects reported the letters they had seen immediately, some forgetting may,still have occurred, and words are easier to retain than random strings of letters.In addition, if perception is fragmentary, subjects in the word condition have agreat advantage because they can often guess missing letters in a word, whereasno such guessing is possible with random letter strings.Thus, it was not really known whether or not Cattells data implied thatfamiliar words somehow facilitated the perception of the letters they contained.In 1969 Reicherand many others since thenshowed that they did indeed.Reicher presented target letters tachistoscopically under three conditions as partof a word, as part of an unpronounceable nonword, or in isolation, alwaysfollowed by a patterned mask. Only one of the letters was then tested by a twoalternative forced choice test which was designed so that both of the alternativesformed familiar words. For instance, suppose the target letter was C thepresentation strings then night be CAR, CTA, or C alone, and on the test thesubject had to decide whether a C or an H was presented. Even under theseconditions, subjects performed better when the target letter was part of a wordthan when it was part of a nonword or alone. Neither differential guessing nordifferential forgetting can explain these results. It appears that being part of aword made the letter easier to see.The situation with respect to word recognition is similar. It is clear thatcontext affects word recognition. Words are easier to perceive when thev are partof a meaningful sentence Tulving  Gold, 1963, and studies thereafter or part of aMost of the studies discussed here are concerned with reading, but similar argumentscould be made about listening.23meaningful text Wittrock, Marks,  Doctorow, 1975. To account for these results, several authors have proposed twoprocess theories, where a bottomup,datadriven analysis process interacts with a topdown, knowledge drivenhypothesistesting process. The basic idea is that context effects have two sourcesStanovich  West, 1981. On the one hand, there is an automatic facilitation ofperception. Context automatically activates some pathways, and this activationbenefits the perception of words that use these pathways, without cost to wordsthat do not. On the other hand, there is controlled hypothesis testing.Hypothesizing a particular word benefits perception if the hypothesis turns out tobe correct, but interferes with perception if it is incorrect. The costbenefitmodel of Posner  Snyder, 1975. was applied to this problem by Stanovich West, 1981.2.1.2. Good and Poor ReadersThe full complex nature of the interaction between these topdown andbottomup processes becomes apparent if one looks at the contrast betwcen goodand poor readers in these terms. What exactly distinguishes a good reader from abad reader. One popular suggestion is that the good reader is more adroit atexploiting the regularities and redundancies inherent in language and does notbother much with laborious bottomup decoding letter by letter or word by word.Thus, Goodman 1976 referred to reading as a psycholinguistic guessinggame, and Smith 1973 argued that reading instruction should rely as little aspossible on decoding skills. Indeed, there is a great deal of evidence that goodreaders are more skilled at crploiting higher order constraints in a text. Perfettiand Roth 1981, for instance, have shown that good readers hypotheses about aword more fully reflect all the relevant information in a text. Meyer. Brandt, andBluth 1980 observed that good readers were more responsive to rhetoricalstructure than were poor readers. Several other studies with similar results couldbe cited, all showing that good readers are better topdown processors they aregood because they know how to use context2 more efficiently.However, we immediately run into a paradox Context effects are most pronounced in poor readers If one looks at the occurrence of semantically appropriate,ubstitution errors in reading, they are more likely to be found in poor readers thangood readers e.g., Kolers, 1975. The greatest facilitation of word recognition bymeaningful context is observed with poor readers, not with good readers Perfetti,Goldman,  Hogaboam, 1979. Furthermore, it is simply not true that good readerstake decoding lightly they fixate almost every content word Just  Carpenter,1980, and they do it so carefully that they are better able than poor readers todetect misspellings and visual irregularities in a word McConkie  Zola, 1981.It has been found over and over again that the best discriminator between2In Chapter I vac have distinguished between con textual factors and the generalsituational context. In the research we review here the situational context is often notconsidered explicitly and the term context is taken to refer to the verbal context of asentence or word.24good and poor readers is performance on simple letter and word identificationtasks see Perfetti  Lesgold, 1977, for representative results. What is reallywrong with poor readers is that they recognize isolated words inaccurately andtoo slowly, and compensate for their lack in decoding skills with contextdependent guessing or hypothesis testing. Therefore, they depend very much oncontextual cues, and, if these are absent or misleading, their performance suffers.Good readers with their superior decoding skills can decode letters and wordsrapidly in a bottomup fashion, and therefore do not normally need to resort toguessing strategies. In this view, context effects are only symptoms what isreally at issue are the speed and accuracy of contextfree word recognitionoperations Stanovich  West, 1981.Thus, we have two findings which appear contradictory at first sight Contexteffects are most notable with poor readers, but good readers are better atexploiting context cues. But there is no paradox here. Good readers are simplybetter than poor readers, both when it comes to decoding skills and to guessingskills Carr, 1981. They form better, more sophisticated, hypotheses duringreading. They do not have to resort continuously to hypothesistesting processesas poor readers are forced to do because of their deficient decoding skills, butwhen they do, they do it well. Frederiksen 1981, among others, reports datathat show this very clearly. In one of his experiments, subjects were given asentence with the last word missing. They were then shown a target word whichthey were required to pronounce. If the target word fit into the context sentence,pronunciation latencies were reduced compared to a condition where isolatedwords had to be read. If the sentence strongly constrained the target word, bothgood and poor readers showed large priming effects savings of about 125msec if the context was only weakly constraining, however, there was apriming effect for good readers but not for poor readers. Good readers were stillable to exploit weak contexts. Somehow, they prepared for a large number ofpossible target words. Poor readers under these conditions were able to generateonly a few candidates for the target word and hence were usually unprepared.For them, the weak context simply was not enough. Frederiksen theorizes thatpoor readers generate contextually relevant lexical items via a slow, controlledserial process, whereas good readers have available a parallel automatic processthat produces a much greater pool of items. Perhaps, however, both good andpoor readers rely on automatic spreading activation type processes, except thatthe good readers do so with more success because they can afford to devote moreresources to this process. In contrast, the resources of the poor readers areexhausted by the decoding process and hence the activation for them is weak andreaches too small a pool of items.In another experiment, Frederiksen 1981 collected pronunciation onset timesfor words and pseudowords of different orthographic structures. He found, forinstance, that pronunciation latencies for threesyllable strings were greater than fortwosyllable strings, resulting in a substantial correlation between structurallymatched word and pseudoword pairs. However, when the words were presented ina strongly constraining context, that correlation went to zero for the good readers,but not for the bad readers The good readers were able to develop taskspecific re25sponse strategies that completely bypassed orthographic analysis, whereas thepoor readers who show the lowest skill in decoding could not give it up.2.1.3. Theories of Word RecognitionThe brief review given here certainly does not do justice to the complexityand richness of the word recognition literature, but perhaps it is sufficient toindicate a that matters are complex, indeed, and b that there is rhyme andreason to the seeming chaos. Such a state of affairs is a challenge to theorists,and they have lived up to it rather well. Theories of word recognition, startingwith the Pandemonium model of Selfridge and Neisser 1960 and Mortonslogogen model Morton, 1969 have been successively refined, up to the mostrecent generation of models Adams  Collins, 1979 Perfetti  Lesgold, 1977McClelland  Rumelhart, 1981 stanovich, 1980.These new models are all interactive models. The evidence against the traditional view of reading as extricatinginformationfromtext is overwhelming, aswe have just seen, ruling out pure bottomup models. Pure topdown modelshave never really existed, strictly speaking, because pure topdown processing ispsychologically absurd. The question is how to conceptualize the interactions.Without discussion of any specific model here, some common principles can bedetermined. First, there is the notion of a logogen or word demon as a placewhere evidence regarding a word or letter is accumulated. Any stimulus inputactivates in parallel a number of letter and word logogens, as shown in Figure2.1 which is taken from McClelland and Rumelhart 1981. Note that in thisparticular model there are both inhibitory and facilitory connections. Notefurthemore, thar in this model features do not directly feed into word logogens.Conceivably, the feature horizontalbarontop might have a direct facilitoryconnection with ABLE, TRAP, etc., and inhibitory connections with otherwordsall too many such connections, indeed. Similarly, why not have TRIPfacilitate the detection of the feature verticalbarincenter, etc. The questionthat arises, then, is what is the architecture of such systems, what interacts withwhat3There is good reason to believe that the general form of a word analysissystem is that of a cascade rather than a strict hierarchy McClelland, 1979. In acascade, output from a particular level feeds not only into adjacent levels, up ordown, but also, possibly, to more distant higher and lower levels. In a completelyinteracting system every level is allowed to interact with every other. Thecomplexity of such a system would be horrendous, and much of it probablywasted. It is an empirical question which levels in a system interact, and howthough theoretical simulations might provide important clues concerningcalculational feasibility and efficiency.Researchers have just begun to ask such questions and to develop the modelsthat are essential for answering them. A great deal of progress has been made,3Other important components of the model, such as the mathematics of the activationand response generation processes, are of no direct interest here.26Figure 2.1.

It also appears to be a general one, in that the same type ol model that hasbeen proposed for word recognition processes is also suitable for modelingcomprehcnsion processes at other levels. In what follows, we shall expand thispicture to include other levels of comprehension.2.1.4. ImplicationBefore leaving word recognition, however, some general observations needto be made about the status of research in that area. First, we note that we haveobtained a lot of useful information about the process of word identification inreading from some very artificial laboratory studies, using tasks quite unlikereal reading. Reading is most certainly not tachistoscopic word recognition.Carr 1981 points out that in naming or lexical decision tasks meanings areactivated by the input to the human informationprocessing system very early inthe course of the interaction between that system and a word. A word needs to beseen only for 3040 msec for a full semantic activation though, of course, noresponses can be made in that timeresponses occur only 5001500 msec after awords onset. Fixations during reading typically last for about 200300 msec.From the standpoint of word identification, most of that time appears wastedbut,then, reading is not just word identification it is that plus a lot more. Thus, thedifference between reading and word identification must not be overlooked, yetthe experimental work on word identification has proved to be very informativeand has greatly increased our understanding of reading.Second, it bears mentioning that although we are talking about the process ofword identification, this is not a single process, nor is it a unitary skill. Rather, there27are a number of separate components representing perceptual and linplistic subprocesses Frederiksen, 1977. Gross oversimplification and distortion resultsunless the full complexity of the system is taken into account.Finally, we have to face openly some of the consequences of dealing withsuch complex systems. Note that we have discussed experiments in which goodreaders were better users of context, experiments in which they did not usecontext, experiments in which poor readers relied most heavily on context, andso onand some how the same theory accounted for all these diverse, not to saycontradictory, results Do we have here a vacuous supertheory that simplyexplains everything Surely, the theory that explains everything explainsnothing. The problem is, however, that people actually do all these diverse andcontradictory things. Indeed, the most general law of behavior seems to be thatpeople will do almost everything and its opposite, given the right conditions. Atheory, therefore, has to take into account this diversity and be ready to explain Xas well as notX. It is nonvacuous insofar as it specifies the precise conditionsunder which X and notX occur, or under which an observation is evidence for Xor its opposite. An observation may have many causes, and it may confirm Xunder some circumstances and notXunder others. I heories have to be complexbecause the world is complex, but they must not be arbitrary. We mention thisdilemma here in talking about other peoples theories, but we shall meet it againin our own work.2.2. SYNTACTICSEMANTIC PARSINGIn considering how people parse discourse we are still below the level atwhich our model operates, but once again it is important to inquire what weknow about such processes to see how our own proposals might fit or not fitinto a more general model of comprehension.When people communicate via language, their normal purpose except insome specific situations, e.g., literary ones is to communicate some semanticcontent andor a pragmatic message. The former is predominant in writtencommunication though never exclusive, whereas in some types ofconversations the semantic content may be subordinated to pragmatic goals.Syntax, phonology, morphology. and nonverbal expressions, in either case, servein a supporting role. Complex semantic contents can only be expressed orunderstood clearly with the help of syntax, and syntax can make languagecommunication more efficient.2.2.1. The Phrase as a Processing UnitDiscourse comprehension or production always operates under the constraintsimposed by the limits of the human in formationprocessing system. Limitationsimposed by the capacity of shortterm memory are particularly serious ones inprocessing the continuous flow of a discourse. One cannot retain everything onereads or hears for very long, and thus it becomes crucial to know when to discard28what. The syntactic phrase structure of a text provides an important clue for howto chunk it into reasonable units. Thus, one function of syntactic cues in a text isto permit effective shortterm monitoring at this level of analysisadditionalconsiderations enter at the propositional level and macrolevel.There is a great deal of psychological evidence that readers and listeners aresensitive to the phrase structure of sentences and chunk sentences accordingly.Most of this evidence is well known and has been reviewed repeatedly e.g.,Kintsch, 1977a, so that we shall do no more here than cite a few seminalstudies. Thus, the famous click studies, for all the controversies that surroundedthem, in the final analysis show pretty clearly that readers segment text at phraseboundaries e.g., Gawett, Bever,  Fodor, 1966. As far as shortterm memory isconcerned. Jarvella 1971 and others have shown that readers hold the finalphrase in shortterm memory, dumping it when they arrive at a clause boundary,Jarvella employed a free recall paradigm, while Caplan 1972 arrived at thesame conclusion using a recognition test. Through an analysis of the transitionerrors made between words, Johnson 1965 could show that most errors made inlearning a sentence occur at major clause boundaries. For perception as well asmemory, it seems clear that at this level of analysis the clause is the functionalpsychological unit. As we look at the problems involved more closely, we shallhave to modify this blunt claim somewhat Section 2.2.3, because we shall seethat it is not the clause boundaries themselves that are important, but the ways inwhich people use them in their processing.2.2.2. Parsing StrategiesThe question arises of how people detect clause boundaries in a sentence, andhow they derive its syntactic structure. One class of theories holds that they relyon linguistic rules People have implicit knowledge of linguistic rules, whichthey apply in parsing a sentence. What these rules are varies with the particulartheorists thus, in some classical examples they were phrase structure rules, as inYngve 1961, or transformational rules, as in Miller and McKean 1964.Alternatively, the parsing may be done on the basis of strategies. We shalldiscuss the strategy concept in much more detail in the next chapter. Here, therelevant contrast is between a closed, logical system of rules, the application ofwhich will, sooner or later, guarantee the correct parsing of whatever input stringwas used, and an open, nondeterministic, fuzzy system employing strategies.Strategy theories of sentence comprehension were introduced by Bever1970, and have been more recently discussed by Clark and Clark 1977. Thereason for introducing strategies was that some of the rule systems that linguistswere using to parse sentences were implausible as psychological process modelsThe calculations involved, the resources demanded, simply exceeded humanprocessing limitations. Strategies were simpler. They did not guarantee the rightresult, or even a unique result, but it was plausible that people could parsesentences on the basis of strategies. Very soon, evidence was compiled showingthat people really do operate that way.29Again, there is no point in systematically reviewing the literature, because thebasic findings have been discussed elsewhere e.g., Clark  Clark, 1977. Instead,we shall merely present some illustrations of parsing strategies that have beenidentified by various authors, as well as some of the relevant experimental evidence.STRATEGY EXAMPLE 1. Whenever you find a Junction word, begin a newconstituent larger than one word Clark  Clark, 1977, which has the specificsubcase Whenever you find a determiner a, the, begin a new noun phraseBever, 1970. A parser using this strategy can be tricked into making mistakes,as the following garden path sentence shows The old man the boats. Thedeterminer the sets up an expectation for a noun phrase, old man is interpretedaccordinglyand then has to be reinterpreted when the second noun phrase comesin, because NP  NP does not yield S we expect a VP after a NP. Thisreinterpretation disrupts comprehension process.STRATEGY EXAMPLE 2. Another subcase of the same general strategy isWhenever you find a relative pronoun that, which, who, whom, begin a newclause Clark  Clark, 1977. This strategy implies that sentences in which relativeclauses are signaled by a relative pronoun will be easier to parse than sentenceswithout such a signal. It has been shown experimentally that this is indeed thecase, at least for selfembedding sentences. In one relevant experiment, forinstance, Fodor and Garrett 1967 had subjects paraphrase sentences such as1 The pen which the author whom the editor liked used was new.2 The pen the author the editor liked used was new.The relative pronouns were clearly helpful to the subjects, as indicated by theirability to paraphrase sentences like 1 faster and better than sentences like 2.Similarly, Hakes and Foss 1970 showed that when subjects were asked todetect a particular phoneme in a sentence they were listening to, their reactiontimes were slower for sentences of the second type than for sentences of the firsttype. This observation is taken as evidence that when the sentences lackedrelative pronouns, ,ubjects had to apply more of their resources to the parsingtask, and had less left over for the secondary phoneme detection task.STRATEGY EXAMPLE 3. Try to attach each word to the constituent thatcame just before. Kimball 1973 and Clark and Clark 1977 provide aninteresting example for this memorysaving strategy. Consider the followingsentence3 The dog that was rabid came from New York.Here the strategy works fine the relative clause that was rabid gets properlyattached to the dog. But we run into a problem in Sentence 44 The dog came from New York that was rabid.The strategy tells us to attach the relative clause to New York this does not work30semantically, and we have to reinterpret the sentence. In Sentence 5, thesituation is worse yet5 The dog bit the fox that was rabid.If the speaker of 5 intended the dog to be rabid, the strategic comprehensionprocess will misinterpret 5 that was rabid will be attached to fox, and this timethere is no semantic safeguard to prevent the misinterpretation.STRATEGY EXAMPLE 4. Use semantic constraints to identify syntacticfunction was one of the original five strategies described by Bever 1970 it wassubsequently elaborated and refined by Clark and Clark 1977. This strategy is avery important one, and in extreme cases it allows the construction ofpropositional representations directly from the sentence, bypassing syntacticanalysis altogether. If we want to say Dog bites man, we can do without syntaxthough we need it for the more interesting Man bites dog. In other cases,although the syntactic cues are there, they are simply not used, as when 2 and 3yearold children treat the following sentences all alike6 The cat chased the mouse.7 The mouse was chased by the cat.8 The mouse chased the cat.9 The cat was chased by the mouse.The children know that the cat chases the mouseand that is what all of thesesentences mean to them Strohner  Nelson, 1974.STRATEGY EXAMPLE 5. Select the grammatical subjcet of an initialsentence as the preferred referent for a pronoun occurring in ct followingsentence. This is one of several strategies identified by Frederiksen  1981 forestablishing the referents of anaphora. Consider the following10 Modern advertising does not, as a rule, seek to demonstrate thesuperior quality of the product.11 The superior quality of the product is not, as a rule, what modernadvertisting seeks to demonstrate.12 It plays up to the desire of Americans to conform, to be like the,Joneses.The reading times for 12 are faster when 12 follows 10 so that the it refersto the subject of the preceding sentence, then when it follows 11 where this isnot the case. We shall show in what follows Experiment 2, Section 5.5 that thissubject strategy is only one of several strategies used in pronoun identification,and apparently not the dominant one Agent role, recency, and especiallytopicality must also be considered.Of course, there are interactions among strategies. For instance, another strategy that readers use in identifying pronoun referents is a minimum distance princi31pleroughly, try the closest noun phrase. If that were the dominant strategy, the itij 12 would be easier to identify following 11, where the referent modernadvertising comes at the end of the sentence, than following 10, where it is atthe beginning. It is probably quite easy to bias subjects in favor of anotherstrategy e.g., through the establishment of an experimental set in favor of aparticular kind of anaphoric relationship, and thus to obtain experimental tesultsthat are exuctly the opposite of Frederiksens.To avoid misunderstandings, it should be emphasized that the term strategy isused in all this work without any connotations of consciousness or intentionality.4 On the contrary, comprehension strategies are generally unconscious.Strategic behavior is neither necessarily controlled nor necessarily automatic inthe sense of Shiffrin and Schneider 1977. Like other behaviors, it varies fromcontrolled i.e., slow, sequential, resource demanding to automatic fast,parallel, effortless as a function of stage of practice. The child, in the process ofacquiring a strategy, uses it quite differently than does the mature speaker of thelanguage. For the latter, what were once demanding tasks have become fullyautomated with very low resource demandsunless, of course, the smoothoperation of strategies is blocked as in the garden path sentences, and attentiondemanding, controlled, repair processes are required.It is important to realize that although strategic systems are nondeterministic,open ended, and highly context sensitive, theories that have these properties maynevertheless be stated with precision and the objectivity required for a scientifictheory. A favored way to model sentence parsing is as an Augmented TransitionNetwork Woods, 1970 Wanner  Maratsos, 1977. There is nothing in thisformalism that says that it must inherently be either rule based or strategy based.Either kind of model could be implemented as an ATN model Kaplan, 1972.Alternatively, parsing can be modeled as a production system J. R. Anderson,1976. Again, production systems are neutral with respect to the strategyversusrule issue.In our discussion of the word recognition literature in the previous section ofthis chapter, we concentrated on the interactive nature of the process. Topdown.predictive, hypothesis testing was shown to combine with bottomup, stimulusdriven, analysis. This is just as much the case when it comes to parsing asentence. Because strategies function as predictors, they induce topdownprocessing. Thus, if you find a determiner, look for a noun phrase if you haveidentified a verb, search for its corresponding arguments if you have a contentword with a conjunction at the beginning of a clause such as Mary and, lookfor another content word of the same kind as the first one Bill. Thus, aninteractive processing model with topdown and bottomup components is just asappropriate for the parsing level as it vas for the word identification level ofcomprehension.4These matters are discussed more fully in the next chapter. We merely anticipatehere a few crucial points which are relevant in the present context.322.2.3. Sentence Processing in DiscourseWe end this review of the sentence parsing literature with a caveat. We havelearned a lot from these studies, but if we are interested in discoursecomprehension we must beware of taking for granted the relevance of sentencegrammars and psychological experiments using sentence lists. Understandingsentences as part of a discourse is a different process from understandingsentences in isolation. Irrespective of the particular form of the sentence, whatmay be important is how well the sentence can be integrated semantically withthe previous discourse Haviland  Clark, 1974 Huggins  Adams, 1980. Howfast we can read a sentence depends on its discourse context Haberlandt, 1980Sanford  Garrod, 1981. How much difficulty fourthgraders have with varioussyntactic forms depends on the context in which they are used there are very fewforms children cannot understand in at least some context Lesgold, 1974.We are interested in the strategies people use when they read a texta bookchapter for an exam, or a story for their entertainment. These strategies may bequite different from the ones subjects adopt in a psychological experiment. Inorder to have a wellcontrolled experiment, the experimenter typically arrangesan artificial, underdetermined situation in which to study the subjects strategies.Such situations are new to the subject his or her normal strategies fail preciselybecause the experimental material has to be well controlled, which means thatthe usual redundancies on which these strategies rely have been removed fromthe text. Hence, the subject falls back on general problemsolving strategies anddevises on the spot some procedure that works. The trouble is that this proceduremay he entirely task specific and of no general interest as far as normal discourseprocessing is concerned. Thus, if we observe in the laboratory how peopleidentify anaphora when they are given lists of sentence pairs in which certainwellcontrolled anaphoric relationships are built in, we might identify suchstrategies as minimum distance or subject preference, as mentioned earlier. Butwe need additional evidence to determine whether and to what extent thesestrategies are used in reading a text. or in producing a discourse. We might beleft with quite the wrong conclusions from such experiments and give quite thewrong advice to educators, textbook writers. etc.. KarmiloffSmith 1981, forinstance, has observed how children of various ages and skill levels use pronounsin producing a story. In this situation, the strategies for anaphoric reference thathave been identified from sentence experiments play a negligible role. Basically,the strategies these children use are discourse determined. Thus, at a certain agelevel, children may reserve the pronoun for the hero of the story if there is onlyone later, when they use a pronoun to refer to someone something else, theyadd an identifying noun phrase e.g., hethe onc with the balloons if a storyhas two main characters, yet another strategy fur pronoun use is employed, andso on. Studying sentences in isolation may tell us something, but it is alsopossible that it will mislead us. See also MarslenWilsoil. Levy,  Tyler, 1982,as well as Chapter 5 of this volume.332.3. AMBIGUITYNeither words nor sentences are mapped into meanings onetoone, and psycholinguistic research, from the very beginning, has been fascinated by the issueof higuity. It is an important issue, indeed, and a complex one, and we shall haveto examine it in some detail to determine how our model is to deal with theambiguities that are inherent in the use of language. We shall first start with adiscussion of the identification of ambiguous words, which does not reallyconcern our model directly, but which will form an important background for thetreatment of ambiguity in the construction of sentence and discourse meanings.2.3.1. Lexical Decisionslntrospections about sentence ambiguity are quite compelling. If we hear onradio13 Three masked gunmen robbed a bank Yesterday.we are not aware of the alternative meaning of bank as river bank. If someonesays in the supermarket14 These brown ones over there, thev are cooking bananas.we are not aware of an alternative parsing with are cooking as the verb andbananas as the object. This suggests an intelligent word recognition mechanismthat someuses the context in 13 to retrieve the right meaning of bank withouteven connsidering alternatives. In parsing 14, the fact that they is deicticallyidentified as brown objects immediately precludes the alternative parsing of thesyntactically ambiguous second phrase requiring an animate subject. So muchfor intuition. What are the factsIn the case of lexical retrieval, they flatly contradict intuition. When peopleread a lexically ambiguous word in a text they retrieve all of its meanings,contextually appropriate or not. A choice is then made among these alternatives,and the inappropriate meanings are rapidly deactivated. There is considerableconverging, evidence on this issue, but the clearest results are those of Swinney1979. Swinney used a crossmodality priming task, in which the primary task of asubject , to listen to a text presented over earphones, and later to answer somequestions thout it, to make sure it was properly comprehended. In parallel with this,the subject performs a lexical decision task On a screen in front of the subject,letter ,trings are presented from time to time, and the subject has to react as fast aspossible by pressing one key if the letters form a word and another key if they donot. It is well known that in such a task priming effects occur The subject is fasterat deciding that something is a word if it is closely related to a word presentedauditorily at the same time. Thus, if the subject hears On the, flower sat a largeyellow butterfly which. . . . and the word insect is presented visually simul34taneously with butterfly, insect is identified as a word more rapidly thanappropriate, control words that are not related to butterfly. There will be asavings of around 40 msec, which is called a priming effect.Swinney used lexically ambiguous words in this task. He showed that, forexample, when subjects hear the sentence15 The house crawled with cockroaches and bugs were everywhere.words presented visually at the termination of bugs were primed equally whetherthey were related to the contextually appropriate meaning of bug as insect or tothe, inappropriate meaning of spying device. Thus, in 15, both spider and spywoulC be primed by bugs. However, if a delay is introduced between bugs andspider or spy , only the contextually correct meaning will exert a priming effect.After about 500 msec, only spider is primed by bugs, but not spy.Thus, when a lexically ambiguous word is encountered during reading allmeanings of the word though not their full meanings, presumably are activatedmomentarily and offered to a contextbased decision process for selection. Theselection of the appropriate meaning is made quite rapidly, and inappropriatealternatives are suppressed without ever reaching the threshold of awareness.Actually, this is precisely what psychologists should have suspected all thetime because it is also how perception works. The perceptual system prefers toprocess all kinds of information rather than filtering out everything that is notrelevant at the moment. The whole flux of stimulation around us is continuouslymonitored at an unconscious level. Unconscious does not necessarily meansupcrficial, and a lot of evidence exists today that this unconscious perceptualprocessing extends to the level of meaningfulness. However, only a small subsetof what is taken in is selected for further processing and ever becomes aconscious perecpt. The capacity limitations of human information processing donot limit the perceptual processes per se, but have to do with consciousness andmemory. Psychologist, only became aware of this important fact about humaninformation processing, as the history of theories of attention shows, in the timebetween Broadbents filter model Broadbent, 1958 and current allprocessingtheories Shiffrin  Geisler, 1973. Kintsch 1977a describes this shift in ourconception of the nature ut capacity limitations in some detail. Wordidentification is a kind of perception. It works as a parallel system that fullyanalyzes the input for all possible interpretations and then picks out what itneeds. It does not make shrewd guesses early on, but uses all the informationavailable and only later decides. The cost is a lot ol brute force calculationas it iselsewhere in the perceptual system. The benefit is that the final decisions aremade in a fully informed maneuver, and hence are more likely to be the correctones.2.3.2. Multiple Paths in Sentence ParsingDo we understand sentences in the same manner as we perceive words Thatis, do we work on many possible parsings in parallel, or do we make the kind of35early commitments introspection suggests The answer is at present unknown.There are no a priori reasons why sentence parsing has to work the same way asword recognition. Indeed, there are some good arguments why it should bedifferent. Lexical items are relatively fixed chunks in memory and their retrievalis highly automatized. But we do not automatically retrieve sentences, let alonediscourse meanings rather, we construct them. It may not be very expedient toconstrurt many irrelevant alternatives. In fact, if we did so for all contexts, wemight invite a combinatorial explosion. It is quite possible that the higher mentalprocesses differ from perception in this respect.It is equally possible, however, that the parsing process relies on extensivecalculations in much the same way that perceptual processes do. Woods 1980strongly advocates this view from a computational standpoint. He describesvarious methods used in artificial intelligence for exploring multiple evaluationsof a sentence, such as backtracking, where, while one alternative is beingexplored, information relevant for others is carefully retained for possible lateruse, or separate virtual processing, where alternatives are followed up in parallel,until a choice among them can be made on the basis of some higher levelplausibility judgment.It is certainly impossible to understand sentences on the basis of localinformation alone. Consider the following sentence cited after Woods, 198016 The city council refused to grant the wornen a parade permit becausefearedthey violence.advocatedWith either verb in penultimate position the sentence is readily understood. Buthow do we pick one referent for they with feared and another one with advocatedThe strategies that we have discussed thus far at best provide the right candidatessubject bias in one case, and minimum distance in the other, but to actually makethe identification, quite extensive additional computations must be involved. Localconstraints alone are insufficient Either the council or the women can fear as wellas advocate. Thus, it would seem that in understanding 16 all possible pronounreferents are computed and the one that makes sense globally is eventuallyadopted, much the way ambiguous content words are treated. Indeed, there is directevidence that people compute all possible referents for a pronoun. Frederiksen1981 reports that sentences with an ambiguous pronoun take much longer to readthan unambiguous target sentences 277 msecsyllable versus 208 msecsyllable.All alternative referents for a pronoun i.e., nouns that agree in gender and numberare retrieved when a pronoun is encountered, and a selection is then made that fitsthe semantic constraints of the text.Parsers operating in this manner will necessarily have to do a large amount ofcomputation. Nevertheless, even if computations are cheap, there must be some limitto how much can be computed. One suggestion that we would like to offer is thatclause boundaries serve as decision points Alternatives are explored in parallelwithin a clause, but when a major boundary is reached, a selection is made and the36nonselected alternatives are discarded. Bever, Garrett, and Hurtig 1973 haveargued that this is indeed the case. They showed that although people find itharder to complete ambiguous phrases such as17 Although flying airplanes can . . .than they do suitable unambiguous control phrases MacKay. 1966, this is nolonger true when they are given still ambiguous but completed clauses, such as18 Although flying airplanes can be dangerous, he . . .After having crossed the clause boundary, people are apparently left with onlyone reading of 18. Clark and Clark 1977 point out that the reason clauseboundaries are so important may simply be due to that fact that most strategiesdeal with constituents no larger than the clause. In most cases, local informationis probably sufficient, hence the psychological effects of clause boundaries. Aswe have seen. however, local constraints are not always powerful enough, andcomprehension still proceeds smoothly as in 16, or local constraints can bemisleading and disrupt comprehension as in garden path sentences.Whether a clause boundary forms an effective decision point in a sentenceappears to depend on several factors. If a clause is very short, there is very littleincentive for segmenting the discourse at that point and erasing computations Carroll  Bever, 1976. The deciding factor, however, appears to be whether theprocessing strategy employed requires information from beyond the clause. If aclause is semantically complete, it acts as a processing unit if the semantic interpretation cannot be completed within the clause. the clause boundary is ineffective. An experiment by MarslenWilson, Tyler, and Seidenberg 1978 using arhymemonitoring procedure showed this quite clearly. Subjects were asked tomonitor sentences for words rhyming with a given target word, and the latency oftheir detection response was taken as a measure of the accessibility of the sentencein memory. When subjects were asked to monitor the following two sentences fora word that rhymes with doubt, their latencies were longer in 19b than in 19a19 a. Although Mary rarely cooks trout, when she does it is delicious.b. Although Man, rarely cooks, trout is one thing she prepares well.In 19a the rhyming word trout comes at the end of the phrase and is thereforehighly constrained and detected more rapidly than in l9b where it follows asegmentation point in the sentence. The clause boundary in 20b, however, isquite ineffective monitor for a word that rhymes with bats20 a. Even though they are quite small cats, they need a lot of space.b. Even though they are quite small, cats need a lot of space.Cats is detected equally fast in either context, showing that the clause boundary in20b did not have the same effect as in 19b. The difference is that 20b is notsemantically complete. Computations cannot be finished and erased at the clauseboundary because thev still needs to be identified. As Clark and Clark suggested, it37is not the clause boundary per se, but peoples processing strategies that areimportant.What happens when we comprehend larger discourse units Do people compute alternative macrostructures, eventually settling on the most promising oneIntrospectively, we appear to be committed to one interpretation, and if we suddenly realize a text is about something quite different than we thought, weexperience a conscious, effortful reconstruction not unlike the one in garden pathsentences.5 But too much reliance on introspection would clearly be foolish inthis case and definitive experimental results are not available as yet. Thus, wesimply note that the theory of comprehension advocated here explicitly assumesthat only a single alternative is followed up at a time in organizing a text. Ourorganizational strategies choose a single knowledge proposition in terms ofwhich to organize the semantic units of a text. Once the choice is made, theprocess is committed to it, until conditions are ripe for a new choice. There is noparallel exploration ot alternative text organizations. Although this is clearlydifferent from what happens at the word identification level, such a model is notimplausible. Brute force computations may be the best solution when there arerelatively few retrievable alternatives, as in word disambiguation, but it is hard tosee how it could be employed at the higher levels of analysis without totallyoverwhelming the system. It may very well be the case that at this levelperception is different from comprehension. We do not know that it is, butworking out in some detail one of the alternatives should help us to decide thistricky but important issue one way or another.2.4. SEMANTIC UNITS PROPOSITIONSIn order to study the semantic components of discourse processing, somerepresentation of the content of elementary meaning units is required.Linguists, computer scientists, and psychologists have developed a numberof conventions for the representation of meaning involving propositionalunits. Differences between the various systems are often not very importante.g., it is merely a matter of convenience whether graphic networkrepresentations are used or listbased representations. Among the earlydevelopments within linguistics we mention Vendler 1967, Weinreich1966, van Dijk 1972, as well as the influence of case grammar, such asFillmore 1968 and Stockwell, Schachter, and Partee 1973. Proceduralrepresentations were favored by Miller and JohnsonLaird 1976 andWinograd 1972, among others. Graphic networks of one kind or another wereused by Norman and Rumelhart 1975, Schank 1975, Woods 1975, and deBeaugrande 1980, for instance. Proposition lists were introduced by Kintsch5Reading a text at more than one level, that is, constructing a complexmacrostructure, is something else again, as are explicit alternatives in a macrostructure,such as might be formed in reading a mystery novel.381974, Frederiksen 1975, Meyer 1975, Anderson and Bower 1973,Anderson 1976. Clark and Clark 1977, and Kieras 1981a, to cite just someofthe major examples. Manuals for propositionalizing text have been providedby Turner and Greene 1978 and Bovair and Kieras 1981. As all of thesesystems arc largely equivalent except for the use of decomposition, as will bediscussed in what follows, and most of the differences are based on essentiallyarbitrary decision, which these authors were forced to make, it would be of littleuse to compare and contrast these various systems.Although there are problems with any such system, and an irreducible degreeof arbitrariness, propositional analyses have worked very well in practice. In ourexperience, people learn to propositionalize texts quickly, and the interjudgereliability in such analyses is reassuringly high. For many purposes, such asscoring recall data for which several of these procedures were originallydeveloped, ur providing a representation for the semantic level of analysis in theprocessing model to be discussed in the succeeding chapters of this book,propositional analyses have served very well. One must, however, guard againstthe view that they are allpurpose representations, and, in particular, provide therepresentation of meaning. They are no more than a toolindeed, a ratherprimitive oneuseful for certain purposes and useless for others. Logic andformal semantics, specifically. need quite different tools which, however, are aslittle suited to our purposes as the propositions used, in text analyses are totheirs. Every branch of science develops a representation language suited to itsown goals. The representation of meaning is an elusive and deceptive goal seeKintsch, 1982c, for further discussion.Ideally, of course, one would have an explicit processing model that wouldtake text as its input and derive a semantic representation such as the onediscussed here. There are several parsers today that arc able to do that in somerestricted domains e.g., Winograd, 1972 Schank, Goldman, Rieger, Riesbeck, 1975 Woods  Brachman, 1978 Anderson, 1976 Simmons, 1978.As yet there is no system able to parse arbitrary English text reliably. However,the necessary components for a successful parser are being brought together, andwith a better understanding of the cognitive principles involved thus, the timemay be approachin, when a truly successful general parser can be developed.2.4.1. Propositions as Psychological Processing UnitsAlthough it is not yet entirely clear how to construct a good parser, it iswidel accepted that the output to be obtained from such a parser will be asemantic representation of the kind discussed here. Psychological research in thelast feti years has provided a sound basis for such an expectation. The semanticunits which were devised mostly on the basis of linguistic considerations havebeen shown to function as psychological processing units. Four lines ofconverging evidence support this conclusion.1 . Cited recall studies. Lesgold 1972, Wanner 1975, and Anderson and39Bower 1973the last with mixed resultshave all shown that words from thesame proposition are more effective recall cues than words from differentpropositions of a sentence. Thus, in the following sentence2l The mausoleum that enshrined the czar overlooked the square.overlooked will be a better recall cue for mausoleum than for czar, in spite af it,greater physical proximity to the latter.2. Free recall studies. Buschke and Schaier 1979, Goetz, Anderson, andSchallert 1981, Gracsser 1981, and Kintsch 1974 have reported evidencethat propositional units tend to be recalled as a whole. The particularly extensiveexperiment by Goetz et al. will serve as illustration. In this experiment, subjectswere given blocks of eight sentences to read and recall immediately afterward. Ineach block, three of the sentences were singleproposition sentences e.g.. Thecustomer wrote the company a complaint and three were threepropositionsentences e.g., The famous professor lectured in the classroom, with the lasttwo sentences in the block serving as a shortterm memory buffer. Six differenttypes of threeproposition sentences and three different types of onepropositionsentences were studied Over 94 of the words recalled from the threeproposition sentences arose from the recall of complete constituent propositions.In other word, if any part of a proposition was recalled, the whole propositionwas recalled. Interestingly, Goetz et al. also included sentences in which thepropositions did not form such wellintegrated semantic units as in the precedingexamples. Thus, they used sentences like The comedian supplied glassware tothe convicts, or The bedraggled intelligent model sung. Preformed associationsor familiarity play little or no role with these sentences nevertheless, holisticrecall was just as strong as with the familiar, wellintegrated sentences 89.What is processed as a propositional unit gets recalled together, irrespective ofsemantic plausibility and familiarity.3. Reading time and recall. How fast people read and what they can recalldepends, inter alia, on the propositional structure of sentences. Forster 1970showed that if words are presented one by one at a rate of 16 words per second.subjects were able to report more words from oneproposition sentences thanfrom twoproposition sentences. All sentences in his experiment were six wordslong. To cite his most extreme examples, subjects were able to recall 4.41 wordson the average when they saw sentences of the form The kitten climbed over thefence, but only 3.09 words from sentences like The truck Susan was drivingcrashed.Kintsch and Keenan 1973 gave subjects sentences to read that were approximately equal in length but varied in the number of propositions. The subjectspressed a button as soon as they were finished reading each sentence and thenattempted to recall it as well as they could, not necessarily verbatim. Sentence21 is an example of a sentence with four propositions sentence 23 containseight propositions22 Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome, took the women of the Sabineby force.4023 Cleopatras downfall lay in her foolish trust in the flickle politicalfigures of the Roman world.The more propositions subjects were able to store in memory as assessed by theimmediate recall test, the more encoding time was required. Reading times increased from about 10 sec for 22 to 15 sec for 23 About 1.5 see of additionalreading time was required for the recall of each additional proposition. Forlonger paragraphs, as much as 4.5 sec additional reading time was necessary forrecallin, each proposition. However, with the longer paragraphs, forgetting andretrieval problems enter the picture, so that the value of 1.5 sec per proposition isprobably a more accurate estimate of the rate at which propositions are encodedwhen readinL simple texts.Graesser, Hoffman, and Clark 1980 replicated the finding of Kintsch andKeenan 1973 that reading time increases as a linear function of the number olpropositions in a sentence, but obtained substantially lower estimates ofencodiny times. They found that subjects needed only 117 msec to interpret aproposition6 and argue that the estimates obtained by Kintsch and Keenan areinflated. With sentence length held constant, few proposition sentences introducemore new arguments than manyproposition sentences, and the time toforeground new argumenta is therefore confounded with the encoding time perproposition in the Kintsch and Kcenan experiment. In the Graesser et al. study,the number of new arguments was factored out statistically. It, too, was found tobe a significant contributor to reading time see also Kintsch, Kozminsky,Streby, McKoon, and Keenan, 1975, as were number of words, syllables, andletters, familiarity, and especially narrativity. Studies in which number ofpropositions and number of new arguments are experimentally manipulated areindispensable for obtaining accurate estimates for encoding times per propositionand new arguments the results of multiple regression analyses have to beconsidered with caution, too, because they depend on how this analysis isperformed.4. Priming studies. While the three groups of studies reviewed thus farstrongly suggest that propositions are important psychological processing units,each one taken separately can be criticized on grounds of experimental design.Basically, the problem is that in each case different sentences are compared thatvary in the number of propositions, but that necessarily also vary in many otherwaysthe choice of lexical items, syntax, familiarity, semantic integration, etc.One can try to control these factors, but the possibility of confounding is alwaysthere. Ratcliff and McKoon 1978 have developed a procedure that avoids thesecriticisms. They showed that priming effects on recognition latencies could beused to investigate the structure of discourse. On each trial they showed theirsubjects four sentences for 7 sec each. The sentences were of five different types,based on one or two propositions. After reading these sentences, the subjectswere given a recognition test with single words from the sentences and unrelateddistractor words. The subjects task6Haberlandt, Berian, and Sandson 1980 observed values in a comparable range 168157 msec.41was to respond as fast as possible by pressing either a yes or a no button,depending on whether or not the word had been seen before. In this task, areliable priming effect can be observed If a subject has seen a word from a givensentence and correctly responded with the yes button and another word ispresented from the same sentence, the mean reaction time for correct responsesis only 561 3 msec, compared to 671 4 msec when the word is from a differentsentence. Thus, a sentence priming effect of 110 msec is obtained. What isimportant here is that this priming effect is greater 1 l 1 msec when the twowords come from the same proposition than when they come from differentpropositions 91 msec. This amounts to a 207 msec withinproposition primingeffectnot a large effect, but given the extremely small standard error a highlyreliable one. Ratcliff and McKoon could show that it is indeed the propositionalstructure that accounts for this priming effect, and not such surface features asphysical distance. Sentence 21 is actually one of their examples, and the pointthey make is that square is a better prime for mausoleum the withinpropositioncondition than for czar which is much closer to xyuare in the surface structure.They were also able to show MeKoon  Ratcliff, 1980a that these primingeffects were not confounded by preexisting semantic relations Propositionalunits were just as effective when they were poorly integrated semantically aswhen familiar semantic bonds were involved. Automatic rather than controlledprocesses were shown to be involved in priming Ratcliff  McKoon, 1981.We conclude that the evidence for the psychological reality of propositionalunits is overwhelming. The nature of these units appears to be pretty close towhat Kintsch 1974 argued for, though some details of that system appear to bein need of revision e.g., Goetz et al., 1981. Even researchers who formerlyrejected the notion of propositional processing units have come around toaccepting it Anderson, 1980.2.4.2. Semantic DecompositionOne distinctive feature of the Kintsch 1974 system is the use ofcomplex semantic concepts as predicates and arguments of the propositionsrather than decomposition into semantic primitives. Philosophers Katz Fodor, 1963, linguists Lakoff, 1970, computer scientists Schank, 1972,and psychologists Miller  JohnsonLaird, 1976 often view understandinga sentence as recovering its representation at the level of semantic primitives.Thus, understanding John is a bachelor means representing it as John is anunmarried man. The underlying metaphor of such semantic analyses comesfrom chemistry Just as chemical compounds are structures composed ofrelatively few chemical elements, so complex semantic concepts are analyzedinto their semantic primitives. This strategy worked well for linguists in thecase of classical phonology, where phonemes could be decomposed intodistinctive features. It is unquestionably the case that semantic conceptscan also be analyzed into more elementary constituentslinguists do it all42the time, and even our normal comprehension processes often involvedecomposition, for example, when we correctly answer a question about Johnsmarital statuaiter hearing that he is a bachelor. The problem is whether suchdecomposition is an obligatory feature of comprehension. Is the psychologicallexicon based upon some closed set of semantic primitives so that understandingis synonymous with the recovery of these primitives, or does each word in thelexicon function as its m r internal representation for purposes of comprehension,a representation which may be elaborated on demand through meaningpostulatesMany theoretical arguments can be made against the dominant view that regards comprehension as a process of semantic decomposition e. g., Kintsch,1974, but empirically the issue was until recently quite undecided. Althoughsome exprimental evidence was available that suggested that people did notnecessarily decompose complex semantic concepts into their primitives duringcomprehensiar Kintsch, 1974 Fodor, Fodor,  Garrett, 1975, the design ofthese experiment was not entirely conclusive. Kintsch 1974 showed, forinstance, that the procesing load imposed by semantically complex concepts wasno higher than that imposed by simple concepts, as measured by a phonememonitoring task, but as this experimental design depended on statisticallyaccepting a nullhypothesis, the interpretation of his results can be challenged.More recently, however, Fodor, Garrett, Walker, and Parkes 1980 have provideddefinitive results that speak against the decomposition hypothesis. For example,one of the sentence types they investigated was causative constructions such asJohn killed Mary. If kill is treated as a unitary semantic concept, the structure ofthis sentence would be represented in the notation of Kintsch 1974 by24 KILL, JOHN, MARYIf kill is decomposed we have25 P1 CAUSE, JOHN, P2P2 DIE, MARYDo people treat this sentence in the manner suggested by 24 or by 25Fodor et al. devised a rating procedure, where subjects are asked to rate thedegree of relatedness between words. They first showed that this procedure wassensitive enough to reflect the difference in propositional structure of Johnexpected Mury to leave and John persuaded Mary to leave26 P1 EXPECT, JOHN, P2P2 LEAVE, MARY27 P1 PERSUADE, JOHN, MARY, P2P2 LEAVE, MARYSubjects rated John and Mary to be more strongly related in the persuade sentencewhere John and Mary are part of the same proposition than in the expect sentencewhere they are in separate propositions. The question is, now, how do subjects rate43John and Mary in the sentence pair John killed Mary and John bit Mary If theytreat John killed Mary as 24, there should be no difference, in contrast to theexpectpersuade pair if they treat it as 25, the same difference as betweenpersuade and expect should emerge. The results, not only in this case but alsowith several analogous paradigms, were clear The rated degree of relationshipon killed and bit sentences did not differ, contradicting obligatory semanticdecomposition.2.5. COHERENCE2.5.1. Argument Repetition and Levels Effects inFree RecallWhat are the principles according to which coherence is formed As a firstApproximation, Kintsch 1974, Kintsch and van Dijk 1978, and others havesuggested a principle of argument repetition. Two propositions arc related if theyshare a common argument. Coherence is thus reduced to referential ties, which iscertainly an oversimplification, but attractive in its simplicity. Argumentrepetition may often be merely an accidental byproduct of some more basiccoherence relationship among propositions e.g., a causal relationship, orparticipation in the same script, but at least it serves to index the existence of arelationship in an objective, casily identifiable way. Reducing coherence toargument repetition thus provides a convenient first approximation.The psychological importance of shared reference among propositions hasheen demonstrated repeatedly e.g., Haviland  Clark, 1974 Kintsch  Keenan,1973 Kintsch et al., 1975 Manelis  Yekovich, 1976. Haviland and Clark, forinstance, showed that sentences were read more rapidly if they shared a commonreferent with a preceding sentence. It took people less time to read andcomprehend Die beer was warm in the context of 28, where there is a commonreferent hetween sentences, than in 29 where there is no common referent andreaders have to make a bridging inference28 George got some beer out of the car. The beer was warm.29 George got some picnic supplies out of the car. The beer was warm.However, demonstrations that argument repetition alone is not the whole storyare easy to obtain e.g., Haberlandt  Bingham, 1978.The relationships among propositions in textbases constructed entirely on theprinciple of argument repetition turn out to be quite predictive of recall.Specifically, in short paragraphs, if one selects intuitively a predict recall very well.In Kintsch and Keenan 1973, for instance,superordinate proposition andconstructs a textbase hierarchy by subordinating to that proposition all propositionsthat share an argument with it, and then puts at the third level all propositions thatshare an argument with the secondlevel propositions, and so on, the resultingstructures predic recall very well. In Kintsch and Keenan 1973, for instance,44recall of the toplevel propositions was above 90 and decreased rnonotonicallyfrom there to about 60 for the lowest fifth level. Similar results have beenobtained by Kintsch et al. 1975, and, although levels were not always definedin quite the same way, by Meyer 1975, 1977, Britton, Meyer, Hodge, andGlynn 1980, Manelis 1980, and Yekovich and Thorndyke 1981.Hierarchical textbases, even when they are constructed purely on the basis ofsuch a simple criterion as argument repetition, predict free recall rather well, inthat superordinate propositions are recalled much better than more subordinateones.2.5.2. The Kintsch and van Dijk 1978Processing ModelAs the model that we are going to describe in the succeeding chapters of thisbook is an extension, elaboration, but also a modification, of the Kintsch andwun Dijk 1978 model, we need to describe this model here in some detail.A reader or listener cannot construct a textbase only after all the evidence isavailable at the end of a paragraph chapter, book, but must do so in real timeand with a limited shortterm memory capacity. In the 1978 model we assumedthat a reader accumulates semantic units until a sentence or major clauseboundary occurs Miller  Kintsch, 1980, formalized this aspect of the model.At that point, a coherent structure is built on the basis of the pattern of argumentrepetition among the semantic units in the text. Semantic units are added level bylevel, as described earlier, to the fragment of the already existing textbase stillavailable in shortterm memory. If no superordinate units are available in shortterm memory, a new superordinate is chosen from the current input. This choiceitself was outside the scope of the 1978 model and had to be made on the basis ofintuition. Bridging inferences were used when necessary. The coherence graphthat was constructed at the end of each processing cycle contained, in general,too many semantic units to be fully retained in shortterm memory duringsubsequent processing cycles. It was assumed that the capacity of the shorttermmemory buffer for holding previous textual material was limited to s semanticunits, where s was a free model paramem to be estimated from the data. Indifferent studies, estimates of s between 1 and 4 semantic units were obtained.The selection of propositions to be retained at each cycle was made on the basis ofthe leadingedge strategy, which favored the selection of semantic units high in thetextbase hierarchy. In case of ties, recency w.made the basis for selection. As theprocess thus moved from cycle to cycle. important superordinate propositions werefrequently retained, sometimes for murLthan one additional cycle. A very generalprinciple of memory thus could be used to account for the differential recall ofsemantic units We remember what we procesa, and if superordinate propositionsare processed more because they are the ones most likely to be selected forretention in the shortterm memory buffer from one cycle to the next,superordinate propositions will also be recalled more. Thus, a processingexplanation was obtained for the structural effect first observed by Kintsch and45Keenan 1973 that the level of a semantic unit in the textbase hierarchydetermines the likelihood of its recall.7This simple model predicts recall just as well as the structural modeldiscussed earlier. Typically, correlations show r  .8 are obtained betweenpredicted and observed recall frequencies for the semantic units of a text e.g.,Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978 Kozminsky, Kintsch,  Bourne, 1981 Miller Kintsch, 1980 Spilich, Vesonder, Chiesi,  Voss, 1979 Vipond, 1980.sProbably, if one just asked people to tell how well each semantic unit of a textwould be remembered. their intuitions would also be as good as the model, but itmakes a difference that .uch predictions can be derived from an at least partiallyexplicit formal model.Besides predicting recall, the model was also very useful in analyzing thereadability of texts. Readability is taken here to mean the relative ease withwhich texts can be read and remembered, as indicated by such measures asreading time per proposition recalled on an immediate test Kintsch  Vipond,1979 Miller  Kintsch, 1980. A significant achievement of the model in thisrespect is that it permits us to quantify aspects of the text comprehension processthat were neglected by traditional readability formulas. Such formulas for afuller discussion see Kintsch  Vipond, 1979 are able to deal only withrelatively superficial surface variables, primarily word frequency and sentencelength, which although important are certainly not the whole story. The Kintschand van Dijk 1978 model introduced two additional determinants ofreadability the number of bridging inferences required to construct a coherencegraph, and the number of memory reinstatements that occur in processing it. Theneed for reinstating a text proposition that is no longer available in the shorttermmemory buffer occurs when the textual input on a given cycle is unrelated to thepropositions still held in the shortterm buffer. In such cases, the model assumesthat the reader searches episodic text memory for possible antecedents to thecurrent propositional input. If a proposition is found that shares an argument withthe current input, it is reinstated in shortterm memory, thus providing a coherencelink between what was read before and the new input. If reinstatement searchesare unsuccessful, a bridging inference is assumed to occur. Both reinstatementsearches and inferences are assumed to be resourceconsuming operations andtherefore likely sources of reading difficulty. Experimental evidence showedthat this was indeed the case Reinstatements do make a text harder to read.Note that the need for reinstatements varies with different readers the bigger a7Cirilo and Foss 1980 questioned this processing explanation. Chcy showed thatwords belonging to superordinate propositions tend to be focused for a longer timealready at first reading, suggesting that their recall advantage is not, or is not entirely, dueto reprocessing cm succeeding cycles. However, since they used rather long texts, theirresults may be caused by macroprocesses which overlay the microprocesses as will beshown in what follows. The fact that the largest number of regressive eye movementsduring reading target superordinate propositions supports the Kintsch and van Dijk modelMandel, 1979.8In computing this correlation, the macrostructure of the text, to be discussed in whatfollows, is also taken into account.46readers shortterm memory capacity, the fewer occasions there will be forreinstatements.Although the number of inferences and reinstatement searches are clearlyimportant for readability, they still do not tell the whole story. Counting only thenumber of bridging inferences that are required is quite unsatisfactory becausethere are many different types of inferences varying widely in difficulty andresource demands. The model is too simple. This simplicity was an asset initiallybecause it permitted us to obtain testable empirical predictions at an early stageof development of the model, but more realistic assumptions have to be made ifwe are to overcome the limitations of the 1978 formulation of the model. Thereadabilit predictions of that model are interesting, but do not exhaust the fullpotential of the approach the recall predictions are reasonably accurate, but stillinvolve an intuitive component. To go beyond the 1978 version of our model, wehave to relax our most restrictive assumption Coherence can no longer beregarded simply in terms of argument repetition. Following earlier theoreticalwork of van Dijk e.g., van Dijk 1977a, we have now developed a much richerand linguistically and psychologically more adequate model of how coherenttextbases are constructed See especially Chapter 5.2.6. KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURESDuring comprehension, readers pull out from their general store ofknowledge some particular packet of knowledge and use it to provide aframework for the text they are reading. That is, they use information fromsemantic memory to organize the text they read in order to form a new episodicmemory trace analogous to the subject in a traditional memory experiment whoorganizes a categorized word list on the basis of his or her knowledge aboutsemantic categories in forming a new episodic trace for the list.2.6.1. Causes and GoalsIf we ask ourselves what sort of knowledge Sources readers use in thisproccess, the easy answer is almost any we can think of. There are someparticularly important types of knowledge, though, which deserve specialdiscussion. Causal relation, in the physical world and the goals, plans, andintentions of human actors play a predominant role and have received muchattention in the literature.Causal relations exist between states and events in the physical world.Knowledge about them is often crucial for interpreting a text Norman Rumelhart, 1975 Schank, 1975 Schank  Abelson, 1977 Warren,Nicholas,  Trabasso. 1979 Typically, a text leaves some crucial causalrelationship implicit, and readers hw to supply this missing link fromtheir own knowledge. As it turns out, people are often not very good atthis task, and arrive at misrepresentations that grossly distort the actualcausal relations in the system Stevens, Collins,  Goldin, 1979 Graes47ser, 1981. The causal model that people use is very different from the unambiguous, contradictionfree system of science for an interesting exploration of anaive, nonscientific causal structure see Gladwin, 1970. Indeed, even expertsarguing in their own domain may reason at multiple, mutually inconsistent levelsStevens et al., 1979.Human actions involve relations akin to physical causality, but people aremuch more adept at dealing with goals, plans, and intentions than with casualrelations among physical states and events. This, of course, does not rucall thatnaive action theory is any more consistent and scientific than naive physicsCharniak, 1977 Schank  Abelson, 1977 Wilensky, 1978. Knowledge abouthunian action is employed in story understanding, stories being texts abouthuman actions. Stories can be analyzed as problemsolving tasks, where theprotagonist faces sonic problem in the pursuit of his or her goals and has to finda way around it Rumelhart, 1975. The events in a story that are directly on thepath of relationships between the protagonists initial state and goal state formthe backbone of the story, and are thus considered particularly important by thereader and are recalled best Black  Bower, 1980 de Beaugrande  Colby,1979 Lehnert, 1980a. However, discourse understanding may rely on manyother knowledge sources in content areas other than physical causality andhuman action. We mention as examples work by the Yale group on beliefsAbelson, 1979, attitudes Schank, Wilensky, Carbonell, Kolodner, andHendler, 1978, and emotion Lehnert, 1980a, as well as research in socialcognition concerning personality and social role e.g., Cantor  Mischel, 1977.2.6.2. SchemataIt does not appear to be useful, however, to classify knowledge structures bycontent area, as they seem to be organized in packets that cut across content.Knowledge structures are variously called schemata Rumelhart  Ortony,1977, frames Minsky, 1975, scripts Schank  Abelson, 1977, or MOPSSchank. 1979. Basic to all these notions is the intuition that knowledge must beorganized in packets, that it cannot be represented simply as one hugeinterrelated network uf nodes, but that there must be subsets of that network thatcan function as whole.A persons knowledge about taking a bus might be an example of such aknowledge unitthe bus schema. According to Rumelhart and Ortonv 1977. aachema is characterized by several distinct properties. The schema has variablesthat in any particular instantiation may be filled with constants. For instance, thereere certain actor roles driver, passenger that may be bound by particular persons.Schemata also have other schemata embedded in them thus, the details of payingthe fare on the bus are handled by an embedded paying schema. Schemata mayvary widely in abstractness, as is seen by comparing the relatively concrete busschema or script with a general schema for causality or with some of the moreabstract rhetorical schemata to be discussed in what follows. Finally, schemata aredescriptions, not definitions. The bus schema contains information that is nor48mally valid, plus perhaps some specific details that apply to particular buses, butthere is no specification of necessary and sufficient conditions. Instead, normalconditions from many different content areas are combined, having to do withgoals, consequences, geographic routes, the physical nature of buses,implicationconcerning social status, attitudes toward public transport, andwhatever else.In succeeding chapters of this book, we shall explore the nature of suchknowledge structures and how they are used in discourse comprehension. Thereare many unsolved problems. Although there is wide agreement today as to theneed for some such concept like schema, exactly how to build a knowledgestructure incorporating this notion is another matter. The problem is how to get aknowledge base to deliver nicely prepackaged schemata, while at the same timeretaining its flexibility and context sensitivity. It is simply not the case that everytime we need the bus schema, we want the same package. Rather, in each newcontext, it is a subtly different complex of information that becomes relevant.The problems of schema use that shall concern us can be subsumed under theheadings of identification and application. We shall describe strategies foridentifying and activating relevant schemata in the course of discourseprocessing. Once selected, the schema performs various functions. First of all, itprovides the readn with a basis for interpreting the text. A coherent textbase isobtained by binding the semantic units derived from the textual input to theconceptual skeleton provided hs the knowledge schema. Textbases are the resultof this marriage between schema knowledge and text.However, schemata not only provide a coherent framework for the semanticunits of a text, they also provide a basis for more active, topdown processe,Missing information can be assigned default values if it appears insignificant, orit can be actively looked for in the text. Deviations from the schema either maybe accepted and registered, or, if they appear to be major ones, may become thebasis for a problemsolving effort trying to account for them. As we shall see inthe new section, many of the inferences made in discourse comprehension areschema driven.The schema notion is very widely used today, from theories of letterperception to those of macrostructure formation. On the one hand, this makes itpossible to begin formulating a truly general, comprehensive theory ofdiscourse perception and comprehension, along the lines of Adams and Collins1979, of which our own work could form a part. On the other hand, thenotion of schema is so general that it says little more than that knowledge maybe schematically organized. We cannot indiscriminately reduce discourseprocesses to such a vague notion As we shall show in what follows, we mustdistinguish various kinds of schemabased pnocessmacrostructures andsuperstructures and knowledge representations in longterm memory are by nomeans the same, and collapsing them under the notion of schema producesnothing but confusion. However, we believe that schemtheory can overcomethis danger of vagueness and overgenerality by making the kind of distinctionswe advocate with respect to discourse processes in such areas as perceptionand action as well Local and global coherence, macrostructures, an,49superstructures are potentially as useful in these areas as they are in discourseprocessing.2.7. INFERENCESInferences play a crucial role in discourse comprehension and have receivedtheir share of attention in the literature. Several classification schemes have beenproposed outlining numerous different types of inferences e.g., Crothers, 1979de Beaugrande, 1980 as they can be determined on the basis of linguisticanalysis. On the other hand, a great deal of research has also been devoted to thequestion of what inferences people actually make on the basis of a text, whenthey are asked to do so. The questionanswering method developed by Graesser1981 provides a wealth of information concerning this problem.One aspect that distinguishes textbased inferences is the degree of certaintywith which they can be made. Some inferences appear to be necessary consequences of the text, whereas others we are less certain about and still others wewould regard as no more than plausible or possible conjectures. Thus, if we hearGeorge is older than Sue, we are quite convinced that Sue is younger thanGeorge, or if we hear Sue forgot her raincoat, we take it for granted that shedoes not have it. All p are q p, therefore q has the ring of inevitability, but whenused in concrete instances, common sense might tell us that the conclusion is notall that certain All clams on the beach are edible John found a clam on thebeach therefore it is ediblesome people might still hesitate. Lexical inferencesrange from certainty John killed SueSue is dead to plausibility Sue punchedJohnShe used her fist to the faintest possibility Sue is illwith peritonites.Scriptbased inferences are in general merely plausible, not necessary if Johntook the bus to the airport, we assume he paid for his ticket, but who knows.Conversations are full of plausible inferences It is cold in here probably is arequest to turn up the furnace, but it may just be an admiring remark from onefellowenergysaver to another Rescher, 1976.2.7.1. When Bridging Inferences Are MadeThe biggest problem with discourse inferences is to determine when they aremade Are they part of comprehension proper, or do they occur optionally aftercomprehension It is clear that not all possible inferences can actually be madethe dangers of the resulting computational explosion has been described byRieger, 1977. The question therefore is, how can one distinguish thoseinferences that must occur as an integral part of discourse comprehensionproperOne class of inferences that appear to be necessary during comprehension areare the bridging inferences required for the coherence of the text Kintsch, 1974Clark, 1977 Miller  Kintsch, 1980. Attempts were made to show that suchinferences occur during comprehension by demonstrating that bridging inferences50are verified as quickly as statements explicitly mentioned in the text.9 It isclaimed that when people verify a sentence, they access a matching memorytrace. As bridging statements are verified equally rapidly whether they had to heinterred or not, one can conclude that in either case a memory trace existed inmemory. If the statement was presented explicitly in the text, the memory tracethat was accessed was the proposition derived from it. If the statement had to beinferred, an inleteneegenerated proposition was accessed. If no such propositionhad been interred during comprehension, an inference would have had to begenerated in response to the verification demand, which presumably would haveextended the time needed to make the verification. As no such effect onverification times was observed, it was concluded that the inferred propositionhad been there all the time Keenan  Kintsch, 1974 Baggett, 1975 McKoon Keenan, 1974. A premise of this argumentthat memory lookup alwaysprecedes the inferencemay, however, be wrong. As Reder I 982a has shown,subjects may be using inferences about the plausibility of statements inpreference to a memory search. Quick and easy plausibility judgments appear tobe less resource demanding than memory searches sec also Den Uyl  vanOostendorp, 1980. If that is true, of course, verification times for inferred andexplicit bridging statements would not differ except, again, for the effectsintroduced by the ready availability of surface features in shortterm memory forexplicit sentences, but this result would not tell us when such inferences weremade.Other methods have also been used to investigate when inferences are made.but the experimental difficulties here are considerable. We have alreadymentioned the study by Haviland and Clark 1974 where sentences that requireda bridgininference were shown to have longer reading times than sentences thatdid not. Although it is certainly possible that this increased reading time wasused to make the bridging inference, we have no assurance that this was so it isalso possible that the longer reading time merely reflects the reducedcomprehensibility of the test sentence The subjects are slow because they realizesomething is missing, but thev are not necessarily inferring what the missingelement is McKoon  Ratcliff, 1980b.Cued recall experiments have shown over and over again that subjects areable to make inferences In general, cues that represent inferable information arejust as good retrieval cues as cues that represent information explicitly stated inthe text see Anderson  Ortony, 1975, for a representative example. However,that fact has no bearing on the issue of interest here, namely, when the inferencesare made On the other hand, in the special case of inferring the instruments thatgo habitually with certain verbs, there is evidence that the inferences do not occurduring comprehension, though they are readily made when needed Singer, 19819This is true if the verification test is delayed sufficiently to assure that surfacefeatures oF the teet which would otherwise tacilitate the verification of explicitlypresented statements are no longer available in memory Kint,ch. 1974 Baggctt, 1975.51Corbett  Dosher, 1978. Thus, when subjects hear The worker pounded thenails they do not infer with a hammer, though they can and will do so if there is areason tor it.Today, the most promising experimental technique for investigatinginferences during comprehension is the priming method as used to studyanaphoric inferences hv McKoon and Ratcliff 1980b. One would hope that itwould eventually allow us to answer the questions raised here more definitelythan is now possible.To summarize our present state of ignorance, one could say that we are fairlyconfident today that bridging inferences are indeed an integral part of the comprehension process, though the final evidence is lacking. In this book, we areproposing to look at inferences during comprehension in a rather different wayfrom the one that has characterized research heretofore. We propose seeespecially Chapter 10 that inferences are not a part of the textbase proper butpertain to a different, nontextual, level of analysis, the situation model. Thetextbase is a representation of the text as it is. Bridging inferences and othertypes of inferences belong to the situation model constructed on the basis of thattextbase and knowledge. What is inferred are therefore not propositions in thetextbase but links in the situation model. This shifts the analysis of inferences indiscourse processing from the linguistic level to the conceptual level, and maypermit us to arrive at more clearcut answers than have been possible so far.2.7.2. Elaborative InferencesElaborative inferences are another important type of inference, and we areeven less certain about their role in text comprehension. Elaborative inferencesoccur when the reader uses his or her knowledge about the topic underdiscussion to till in additional detail not mentioned in the text, or to establishconnections between what is being read and related items of knowledge.It seems that elaborative inferences do not necessarily occur during comprehension, but when they are made e.g., because subjects were instructed toelaborate they may have quite beneficial effects on text memory. Thatelaboration can be helpful for remembering has been known for some time.Consider the wellknown paired associate experiment of Bobrow and Bower1969. Subjects were given noun pairs to learn by rote and managed to learn29 of them. Their success rate was precisely doubled when they wereinstructed to elaborate the noun pairs by inserting between the nouns a suitableconnecting verb. Anderson and Reder 1979 report similar results. Althoughelaboration is necessarily more complex when it comes to discoursecomprehension, the basic findings are the same. Reder 1980b found beneficialeffects when subjects were elaborating simple texts on the basis of applicable scriptknowledge. Mayer 1980 gave subjects instructions on how to use a computer andfound several ways of inducing active, elaborative processing, which again provedbeneficial. Thus, at least certain kinds of elaborative inferences duringcomprehension, especially those that produce a tighter integration between52the text and the readers own knowledge structure, result in better learning.10Elaborative inferences also occur during the reproduction of a text, of course,where they are often used to cover up an inability to recall details of the originaltext Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978. Thus elaborations can also distort a text. Thesource of elaboration is some knowledge schema that is being used to interpretthe text, and, if there is a misfit between the schema and the text, it is possiblethat the text will be adjusted to make it conform better to the schema. Theclassical work of Bartlett 1932 was concerned with this phenomenon.A particular kind of elaboration that may be very important for memory involves imagery. It is known at least since Yuille and Paivio 1969 that concretetexts not just words are easier to recall than abstract texts, presumably becausethey invite more elaborations via imagery. Without wanting to enter thecontroversy about what exactly is implied by the use of imagery in remembering,we suggest that there may be a rich and rewarding field for future studies oflearning from texts.In addition to bridging inferences and elaborate inferences, it might be usefulto mention restructuring as a third category of local inferences that seems to beimportant in discourse comprehension. Schnotz, Ballstaedt, and Mandl 1981obtained protocols from subjects summarizing and recalling a text and observedinstances where text elements from different places in the text were combined innovel ways, creating interpretations that presumably were not intended orforeseen by the writer of the text. It is not clear when such restructuring occurs,nor what its precise role is in text comprehension. In every way our knowledgeabout inferences in comprehension is as yet inadequate.2.8. MACROSTRUCTURESMacrostructures are also the product of inferential processes. However, theinferences involved in the generation of macrostructures can be distinguished fromthose discussed in the preceding section because they are reductive and serve toreduce a text to its essential communicative message. Macrostructures were designedto capture the intuitive notion of the gist of a discourse. The theory ofmacrostructures has been explored extensively Bierwisch, 1965 van Dijk, 1972,1977a, 1977b, 1980b. Whereas the textbase represents the meaning of a text in all itsdetail, the macrostructure is concerned only with the essential points of a text. But it,too, is a coherent whole, just like the textbase itself, and not simply a list of keywords or of the most important points. Indeed, in our model the macrostructureconsists of a network of interrelated propositions which is formally identical to themicrostructure. A text can be reduced to its essential components in successivesteps, resulting in a hierarchical macrostructure, with each higher level more con10However, we are far from understanding these matters fully In some cases,elaboration is quite useless for learninga simple, strippeddown summary of theimportant points of a text proves just as good or better than the full, elaborated originalReder  Anderson, 1980, 1983 Reder, 1982653densed than the previous one. In a book, for instance. the top level of the macrostructure may simply be expressed by the title of the book, with the next levelcorresponding to some subjective table of contents. Each chapter would then bebroken down into subsections and subsubsections, eventually arriving at the textbase itself. The textbase thus may be regarded as the lowest level of themacrostructurethe basis from which it evolves. Hence, theoretically,microstructure and macrostructure may collapse. as in onesentence discourses.In general, the macrostructure of a book that exists in a readers mind as thememorial record of his or her interaction with the text will be rather sketchy, ofourse. Furthermore, it will represent only one of a set of possible macrostructures.Euch reader, with particular goals and knowledge background, interacts with thetcxt in a new way, producing a distinct macrostructure. The set of possiblemacrostructures will have much in common, since, after all, all macrostructuresare derived from the same text, but to the extent that knowledge differences existamong readers and that their reading goals are not the same, different readingepisodes will result in different macrostructures. In the extreme case, when a textis being read for a very unusual and specific purpose, the macrostructure may befar removed from the one intended by the author. The set of possiblemacrostructures is, ineed, a fuzzy one. The goals of a theory of macrostructurecan only be to predict some prototypical macrostructures for some commonreading goals, or to explain post hoc what happened in individual cases.As with bridging inferences, elaborations, and the like, the question arises ofwhen reductive inferences occur. Are they an integral part of textcomprehension, or do they occur in response to some specific task demand, suchas to summarize or recall the text Furthermore, assuming that macrostructureformation is a necessary und integral part of comprehension, when in the processof reading or thereafter does it occur In a study by Schnotz. Ballstaedt, andMandl 1981, it was observed that subjects appeared unable to distinguish whatwas macrorelevant in a text when they tried to summarize it right away afterreading it once. They included large numbers of elaborations and restructuringsin their summaries. On a second try. on the other hand, these elaborations werelargely excluded and the length of the ,ummary was reduced by more than half.Indeed, the first summary these subjects produced looked more like a free recallprotocol than a summary. There is at least a suggestion here that in the earlystages of processing i.e., during first readings readers are concerned mainlywith forming a coherent textbase and the local inferences involved in thatprocess reductive inferences may be postponed for later. At least that was thecase with the rather difficult essay text studied by Schnotz et al.macroprocessesmay be more on line with less demanding texts such as stories. In Section 6.6 wetake up this issue in more detail.2.8.1. Structural, Syntactic, and Semantic SignalsThe comprehension strategies which are used to form macrostructures dependon the presence of certain signals in the text that indicate to the listener or reader the54text elements that are to be considered as macrorelevant. Among those, certainkinds of structural signals have been investigated in some detail by psychologistsand educational researchers. A review of this work has been provided byBallstaedt, Mandl, Schnotz, and Tergan 1981. Some wellknown examples are,for instancel.

Initial appearance of sentences Thorndyke, 1977 Mcyer, 1977 Kicras.1978, 1980c, 1981b, 1981c4. Summaries Hartley  Davies, 1976 van Dijk  Kintsch, 1977 Kintsch Kozminsky, 19775. Advance organizers Meyer, 19796. Questions and reminders Rothkopf, 1970In one form or another, these signals have all been shown to facilitate comprehension, although not all of these studies make a clear distinction betweenlocal comprehension processes and macrostructure formation, which ispresumably the locus of the effects observed in these studies.The way in which syntactic signaling devices indicate importance has beenstudied extensivelv by Jones 1977 and van Dijk 1980h. Typically, syntacticsignals have local effects, but local signals can assume a global role if they addup, repeatedly pointing to a particular piece of information. Thus, Kieras 1981b has demonstrated that readers choose a noun more frequently as a paragraphtopic when it occurs repeatedly as a sentence Subject, with other factors such asmere frequency of mention and semantic content controlled.Frequency of mention can be a sign of macrorelevance in itself, however.Perletti and Goldman 1974 showed that merely by mentioning somethingrepeatedly in a discourse, subjects can be led to believe that this item plays animportant role in the macrostructure of the discourse.2.9. SCHEMATIC SUPERSTRUCTURESIn principle, any kind of knowledge source may be involved in forming macrostructures, just as in the case of microstructures Human action schemata mayprovide the basis for organizing a novel, specialized professional knowledge thebasis for a scientific report. There are, however, special types of schemata thatare peculiar to macrostructures, the superstructures van Dijk, 1980b.Superstructures are schemata for conventional text forms knowledge ot theseforms facilitates generating, remembering, and reproducing macrostructures. Notall text types have such conventional forms, but when one exists it seems to playa considerable role in processing.552.9.1 Story Grammars and the Narrative SchemaThe form that has been most widely explored in the literature is that ofsimple, traditional stories Propp, 1928 LeviStrauss, 1960, 1963 Barthes, 1966Greimas, 1966 Todorov, 1968 van Dijk, 1972 Bremond, 1973 for anintroduction and survey, see Gulieh  Raible, 1977. A story is built around anactor and certain tunctions, which are the major actions of a story that change itfrom one state to another such as marriage, betrayal, etc.. Although actors in asimple story remain constant, functions change throughout. In looking atfolktales, Propp originally thought of functions as fixed and limited, but laterinvestigators noted their flexible nature. Only the category to which an actionbelongs is fixed in a story, not the function itself. The actions in a story fall intothe categories of exposition, complication, and resolution Labov  Waletsky,1967. Expositions introduce the actors and the situation the complication bringsin some remarkable, interesting event the resolution returns the story to a newstable state. Simple, oneepisode stories of the expositioncomplicationresolution form can be elaborated by concatenating episodes, permittingcategories to overlap so that the resolution of one episode becomes theexposition of the next, or embedding one episode within another framelikeepisode e.g., a complication may become expanded into a whole series ofepisodes.This knowledge about the conventional form of the text type story is thestory schema. In comprehension, the story schema guides the formation of themacruItructure, that is, the main events of the story are assigned to the schematiccategories described here Kintsch  van Dijk, 1975 van Dijk  Kintsch, 1978.Note that the schema itself is not a macrostructureit is just a mold for formingone.In forming the macrostructure of a story. much more than the story schema isinvolved, however. In particular, our knowledge about human goals and actionsis absolutely necessary for story understanding. A recent attempt to account forall of these factors in story understanding led to the development of storygrammarsand to a rather fierce debate about the adequacy and cognitiverelevance of such grammars. On the one side there are the story grammarians,who postulate that narrative structures do have processing reality Johnson Mandler, 1980 Mandler, 1978 Mandler  Johnson, 1977, 1980 Rumelhart,1975, 1980 Thorndykc, 1977 Stein  Glenn, 1979. The opposing view isheld by those psychologists and scholars from artificial intelligence who claimthat such structures are theoretical artifacts which can or should be explainedaway or modeled in terms of the structure of actions, emphasizing such notionsas motivation, purpose, intention, and goal e.g., Black  Bower, 1980 Bruce,1980 Schank  Abelson, 1977 Thorndyke  Yekovich, 1980. Black andWilensky 1979 have argued that there is no theoretically interesting wayof formulating grammars for narrative structt.res, and that the actualgrammars proposed both in psychology and the theory of discourse cannotbe called grammars. As a specific type of action discourse, stories should be56accounted for instead in terms ut action structural categories, which have realpsychological relevance because they organize the planning and executionaction.In our opinion, the truth resides on both sides, and we will list a number ofarguments to show why this is the case. As discussion has focused mainly onnarrative superstructures, we will for the moment take these as a characteristicexample. However, one should bear in mind that a refutation of the cognitiverelevance of schematic superstructures in order to be persuasive should also beextended to other kinds of superstructures. Obviously, these cannot all be reduce,to actiontheoretical notions.We would like to argue that specific narrative schematic structures and actiustructures are both necessary to account for story processing, for the fullowingreasons1. Stories are a subset of the set of action discourses They are concernedwith human actions and hence will be about the properties of human actions,such as motivations, plans, aims or purposes, and goals van Dijk, 1976. It isobvious that in any semantic theory of such discourses these notions should bemade explicit. I a cognitive model, likewise, understanding a story also meansunderstanding what story is about thus, understanding a story does indeedpartially involve understanding human action.2. A philosophical or cognitive account of human action must be generalnature. In an overall cognitive model of information processing, knowledgeabout the structure of action need not feature in a semantics of action discourse,in a nxxk of narratives, and in a model of understanding and planning realactions as well. We have a general knowledge base concerning the structure ofactions, and this knowledge is used in a variety of tasks. This means that aspecific account of human action is necessary neither in story grammars nor inthe goaloriented models of stories and story understanding. If Ockham shoulduse his razor, it should be here.3. Stories are action discourses, indeed, but not all action discourses alstories. We may have descriptions of actions in police protocols, ethnographicstudies, or manuals for repairing ones car. Stories, apparently, are a subset of theset of action discourses. In our culture, for instance, they are about interestingevents and actions, they may involve tunny, dangerous, unexpected, uncommonevents, and they require human participants, in particular a narrator. Thus, storieshave a number of specific semantic and pragmatic constraints distinguishing thenfrom other action discourses.4. For each culture these semantic and pragmatic constraints may becomeconventionalized. This means that participants not only recognize specific storyproperties, but also become normative about them If there is no interesting event oraction in a story, we do not call it a story, or we think the story is not yet finished,that it has no point, or that it may be a story from another culture. The narrativecategories that have been proposed in the literature are precisely the theoreticalreconstructions of such constraints All stories do, in principle, that is, canonically57have a Setting, an interesting Complication, and a Resolution featuring what theparticipants did in that complicating situation. For specific story types furthercategories are possible. It may be assumed that for each culture, members dolearn some cognitive variant of these categorical constraints on the semanticstructure of stories, and use these during understanding and retrieval. That somepart of the atorv ,,hould feature an interesting event or action is not an inherentpart of action structure. Most of our everyday actions are not interesting andwould not qualify as referential objects for storytelling.5. Although stories are about actions, and therefore story understanding preaupposes knowledge about general and more particular, cultural or stereotypical.teatures of action, what we should emphasize is that knowledge about action isnot the same as knowledge about action discourse. Action discourses aredescription, or ascriptions, or prescriptions of actionsand also of situations,objects, persons, and so on. It is well known that not all aspects of actions can orshould be described in such discourse. For pragmatic reasons only the unknown,interestiliLl things and their actual background need be told. That is, sometimesdetails will be supplied, other times the description will skip many actions ordescribe them only in very general terms. The ordering of action propositionsmay not be identical with that of the actions themselves. In other words, what isreally interesting in a linguistic or cognitive theory of stories is not so much atheory of action, but rather a theory of action description. Thus, such factors asdegree of completeness, level of description, ordering, style, perspective or pointof view, etc. become relevant.These arguments have led us to assume that schematic superstructures forcertain discourse types, such as stories, may be acquired during socialization,and that they play a role in the understanding, the representation, and theretrieval of discourse. That is, we assume that language users know, implicitlyand to some extent also explicitly, which categories and which schemata areinvolved, and that they use these to further organize the linguistic structure of thediscourse. For stories this means that the narrative pattern organizes the semanticmacrostructures, by assigning narrative functions to macropropositions.2.9.2. The Guiding Role of the Narrative Schema inMacrostructure FormationOur compromise position with respect to the story grammar controversy fitsthe available data rather well. When it comes to story recall and comprehension,both action schemata and narrative superstructures are important.There is good evidence today that episodes function as psychological units instory comprehension as well as recall Black  Bower, 1979 Mandler, 1978Thorndyke, 1978. These episodes can usually be formed both on the basis ofnarrative categories, as suggested by Kintsch and van Dijk 1975 and the storygrammarians, and on the basis of the content of the story e.g., Black  Bower,1980. It is hard to disentangle the structure of human action from that of stories,58but in sonic of the studies discussed in what follows this has been achieved tovarying extents.The hierarchical structures generated by story grammars predict recall, in thatsuperordinate nodes tend to be recalled better than subordinate nodesThorndynake, 1977, but the semantic content of these nodes may overridestructural effects Black  Bower. 1980. Similarly, the recurrent observationMandler  John, 1977 Haberlandt, Berian,  Sandson, 1980 that somenarrative categories are better recalled than others beginning, attempt, andoutcome are usually recalled better than goal and ending is difficult to interpret.Goals and endings are readly inferable if the rest of the story is known, and maytherefore simply be omitmi recall. Furthermore, actions are usually more salientthan states by themselves, quite apart from their narrative functions. This cannot,however, be the sole explanation of the results obtained, as was demonstrated byPoulson, Kintsch, Kintsch and Premack 1979. These authors showed youngchildren 4 and 6yearolds pictures which told a story, and asked the childrento describe the pictures as they saw them, and later to recall them. The pictureswere ahown either in their proper order forming a story, or in scrambling orderso that the children could not form a coherent story from what they saw thoughthey tried. A comparison of how well a picture was recalled when it formed partof a story and when it was perceived outside the story context permits one togauge the effects of story structure per se, as the semantic content of the pictureis the same in both conditions. Certain pirtures were recalled better when theywere part of a story than when they were sew isolation. These were the picturesbelonging to the resolution category. As they often depicted states, and were ingeneral not very exciting pictorially e.g., a boy sitting with a dog, as opposed toa fox chasing the dog, they were not very well recalled by themselves. But whenthey formed the resolution of a story, recall was significantly superior due totheir important narrative function, though the fact that it was part of a humanaction schema the boy wanted to get his lost dog back may also havecontributed to the superior recall.Cirilo and Foss 1980 reported an experiment analogous to the Poulson etal. study, in which the same sentence was embedded in different parts ofstories. Thus, semantic content was controlled while narrative function varied.It was found that subjects took longer to read the critical sentence when itplayed an important role in the text according to Thorndykes story grammarthan when it was placed in a Subordinate position. Further evidence thatreading times for sentences are afteca by their narrative role was reported byHaberlandt, Berian, and Sandson 1980, who relied on statistical control ratherthan on experimental manipulation. Their subjects read stories sentence bysentence. Haberlandt et al. were interested exploring the boundary hypothesisWhen subjects arrive at an episode boundary they must engage inmacroprocessing, and hence sentences at the conclusion of an episode shouldbe read more slowly, above and beyond sentencelevel factor influencingreading times. Various cues in the text indicate to the reader that a categoryboundary has been reached e.g., Kintsch, 1977b and serve as signals forcoding operations at the macrolevel. Haberlandt et al. used multiple regression to59predict reading times for sentences, and then showed that the pattern of residualscould be accounted for quite well by this boundary effect. The word andsentencelevel factors that they used in their predictions were number of wordsin the sentence, number of pcopositions, number of new arguments, frequency ofcontent words, rated importance of the sentence, and serial position. They couldshow that narrative function played a role in addition to all these other factors, inthat sentences at episode boundaries were read especially slowly when they werepart of a story, though not when read in isolation.Thus, there exists a wealth of information suggesting that story structureplays an important role in discourse processing, over and beyond other factors.However, because narrative categories tend to be confounded with human actionschemata, the interpretation of these results is not entirely unambiguous. It istherefore necessary to investigate texts whose semantic content and rhetoricalform are less interwoven. So far, relatively little has been done with nonnarrativetexts, though important beginnings have been made Kieras, 1978 Olson, Duffy, Mack, 1980 Olson, Mack,  Duffy, 1981 Otto  White, 1982. In Chapter 7,we shall report some further results with description texts that provide clearcutsupport for the cognitive reality of superstructures and their role inmacrostructure formation.2.10. OUTLOOKWe have now done two things In Chapter 1 we have sketched the model wewant to develop and outlined its general intellectual background. In the presentchapter we have looked in somewhat more detail at the status of the experimentalresearch on discourse comprehension. Our purpose was not to provide a comprehensive review of that work, but rather to determine where and how our ownwork fits in. Our model cannot possibly deal with every component of discoursecomprehension. It must necessarily be selective and even within its domain wecannot treat adequately all relevant aspects. However, it is necessary to view ourmodel against the background of knowledge that has accumulated about allaspects of discourse processing. At the minimum, we require that our model doesnot contradict current knowledae whenever that knowledge is relevant to it, andthat it is constructed in such a way that it is conceivable in principle that it couldsometime be extended to those components of discourse processing that are atpresent neglected.The emphasis in our model is on strategic processes in higher orderdiscourse comprehension. That is, we are concerned with the formation of acoherent propositional textbase and its macrostructure, rather than withlower order perceptual processes or linguistic parsing processes. However,our discussion of the empirical results concerning these lower orderprocesses in Sections 2.12.4 of this chapter makes the point that principleslike the ones that are central to our model might very well also apply to theperceptual and linguistic processing levels that are neglected in our model.This continuity is apparent in two ways. First, the notion of strategy60can be used fruitfullyand in some cases already has beento account for lowerlevels of comprehension processes as well as for the higher levels which are ourmain concern in this book. Second, we have in the concept of schema atheoretical notion that has proven to be useful at levels of analysis as far apart asletter perception and semantic superstructures. In part, this merely reflects thevagueness with which this concept is sometimes used. However, we have arguedand shall try to substantiate these claims further in the chapters to come thattheoretical sustance can be given to the schema concept, and that together withthe numor strategy it is basic to an understanding of comprehension processes ingeneral and discourse comprehension in particular. Thus, although our model isonly a fragment, there is reason to be optimistic that it will prove compatiblewith other models being developed for those aspects of comprehension processesthat we neglect.The second half of this chapter dealt with research results that bear directlyon the assumptions our model makes about comprehension. It is the empiricalexperimental background of our model, just as important for its development asthe theoreticallinguistic background discussed in Chapter l. Unfortunately,experimental research on many of the topics mentioned in these sections is stillin its early stages and sometimes inconclusive. One important function ourmodel can fultill is to serve as a framework for further experimental research inthis area. In v remaining chapters of this book we fill in various missing details,but much more remains to be done along those lines before we have an adequateexperimental base to evaluate our model decisively against alternativeapproaches, formulated and as yet unformulated ones.The experimental research we have discussed here deals, roughly speaking,with the strategic aspects of discourse comprehension. Another data base whichalso has been of great importance for the design decisions we made indeveloping model has not been alluded to here at all. That is the work onmemory. Our model is a processing model, and memory and processingconstraints play a crucial role. As we shall emphasize throughout this book butespecially in Chapters 9 and l0, the process of comprehension cannot beunderstood without taking seriously what we know about memory and informationprocessing. The interplay between information active in shortterm memory andinformation retrieved from the longterm store, and the control functionexercised by the situation model that is generated memory in parallel with thetext representation, are central to our conception discourse comprehension.However, it is not necessary to review the memory literature in the same detail aswe have reviewed here the comprehension literature. Compared to the latter, thefield of memory is much more advanced and a certain consensus exists withregard to the major memory phenomena that have been srudied in the laboratory.It will therefore be sufficient for our purposes to merely remind the readerof the major features of current memory theory when the occasion arises.Chapter 3The Notion of Strategy inLanguage and Discourse Understanding3.1. INTRODUCTIONThe survey of discourseprocessing models given in the previous chapter hasshown that these models have a number of serious shortcomings. Not only arethey incomplete, as many theories are, but, more importantly, their generalorientation as cognitive models is misguided Their focus has been on problemsof representation rather than on the dynamic aspect of processing. What we wantto know is hov textual representations in memory come about, how they areconstructed step by step by the hearer or reader, and what strategies are used tothereby understand a discourse.In this chapter we will explore the notion of strategy as applied to theprocessing of discourse. For simplicity we will use the termcliscourse strategiesto refer to the various strategies used in the production, comprehension, andreproduction of discourse. We will discover that part of these strategies may becalled linguistic, especially those that link textual and sentential surfacestructures with underlying semantic representations. But other strategies aremore generally cognitive and involve the use of world knowledge, the use ofepisodic knowledge memories in the strict sense, and the use of other cognitiveinformation, such as opinions, beliefs, attitudes, interests, plans, and goals.Before we consider in detail in the following chapters the major strategiesinvolved in the processing of discourse, it is necessary to get some insight into thenotion of discourse strategy in particular and into that of strategy in general. Whatprecisely are strategies What is the difference between rules and strategies, be62tween heuristics and strategies Are there any differences between generalcognitive strategies and more specific linguistic or textual strategies, or are thelatter just special instances of the former In other words if people go aboutinterpreting a scene, a sequence of events, or pictures of events, do they usestrategies of comprehension that are similar to those used in understanding adiscourse Besides this conceptual analysis of the notion of strategy and itsrelevance for a cognitive model, we will want to know whether strategies areordered e.g., hierarchically and what kind of processing should be postulated toaccount for them.Our answers to these questions will be partial It is not our aim to provide ageneral theory of strategy, but we do want to specify the notion in more detailthan has been usual in linguistics and psychology. The study of comprehensionstrategies is difficult, however, because some of the more or less explicit modelsof stratcgv analysis in problem solving and decision making cannot be applieddirectly to the very fast and highly automatized strategies used in languageunderstanding. Furthennure, only certain kinds of discourse strategies are open toempirical assessment via protocol analysis, which raises the general problem ofexperimental tests for strategic discourse models.3.2. THE NOTION OF STRATEGYAlthough the notion of strategy has been used in many studies in cognitivescience, it is very rarely defined. As a metaphor it has been borrowed frommilitary science Greek strategia means military command, where it is used todenote the organization of military actions to reach a particular military goal. Theterm has also been used in political science, economics, and in other disciplinesinvolved with complex, goaldirected actions. Simon  1967 has used the termdesign, which seems to lie between our notion of strategy and our notion ofplan. The term strategy has been used extensively in the theory of decisionmaking e.g., by Edwards  Tversky, 1967 Lee, 1971 and Moore  Thomas,1976. In all those cases the concern is not mcrciv with reaching a goal, but withreaching it in some optimal way e.g., quickly, effectively, or with low cost.3.2.1. Action TheoryA strategy involves human action, that is, goaloriented, intentional, conscious,and controlled behavior van Dijk, 1977a, 1980b. Actions are a specific kind ofevent. They imply changes in the worldthey establish these changes or preventthem from occurring. Hence, they are particular ways of changing states of affairsinto other states of affairs, changes that are the consequences of bodily doings,whereas the doings in turn are controlled by cognitive information, such aspurposes and their underlying desires, wants, preferences, decisions, or other motivational structures. The final state, as intended by the agent, is the result of anaction. If the results are in accordance with the intentions of the agent, we say thatthe action is weakly successful. In general, though, agents will not only want to63bring about results, that is, final states of actions e.g., an open door as the finalstate of the action of opening a door, but have more farreaching purposes. Theywant the action and its result to bring about some desired goal a state or eventthat is a consequence of the action we open doors not just to open them, butusually to leave or enter, or to let somebody else leave or enter. Suchconsequences may, of course, be beyond the control of the agent. In that respectwe say that our actions may fail They may not achieve the goal we aimed at. Ifthey do achieve their goal, we say that they are strongly successful. Cognitivelyspeaking, we will assumC thut intentions are representations of doings plus theirresult, and that purposes or aims are representations of wanted consequences ofan action. These cognitive representations allow us to monitor our doings andactions. The analysis of each state of the environment the action domain maybe compared to the cognitive representation of what we wanted.Actions are usually complex. That is, we do something, or a number ofthings, in order to achieve a certain result. Even a relatively simple action likeopening a door involves several successive and concomitant actions, of whichsome will he automatized, that is, not governed by conscious intent norindividually subordinated to a general purpose. Sequences of actions, thus, mayhave intermediate results or goals and final results or goals.Similar definitions may be given for interactions. In this case, several agentsare involved, each with their own doings and actions, and hence with their ownintentions and purposes for their respective results and goals. Interactions may besaid to be coordinated if the agents involved have identical intermediate or finalresults and goals. Moving a heavy table together, playing chess, or going to themovies together are in this way coordinated. The actions themselves may be partially different, but some intermediate or final results and goals may be the same.Obviously, this kind of coordination in general presupposes mutual knowledgeor beliefs about each others respective purposes and intentions.The complexity of action or interaction sequences will in general requiresome form of higher organization. That is, we make global plans to be able toexecute such complex interactions. A plan may be defined as a cognitivemacrostructure of intentions or purposes. It is a hierarchical schema dominatedby a mucrooction van Dijk, 1980b Schank  Abelson, 1977. Eating in arestaurant, making a trip by plane, or building a house are such macroactions. Ata more local level these are performed by the execution of a number of moredetailed actions. The macroaction is the global conceptual structure organizingand monitoring the actual action sequence. It defines the global final results andgoals.Final results and goals can often be realized in a number of alternative ways.There are often several courses of action or interactions that may lead to the samefinal result or goal. In Figure 3.1 we give a tree diagram to represent such a course ofaction. It should be read from left to right, where each branching represents adifferent alternative to reach a next state intermediary result of the specific courseof action path. The initial state of the course of action is characterized here only bythe fact that a state of affairs p1 does not hold. The general, overall purpose is to actsuch that p1 will be realized as a consequence of the action sequence. In the finalP v  Pz. Ps Pi Pa Ps64P i Pe P7 P i Px P9Pi Pi PPFigure 3.1. A schematic representation of alternative courses of action.states we read that p1 in the alternative possible worlds has been realized as aconsequence of the actions. The final states, however, are not only characterizedby p1 , but also by other properties p2, p3, etc. . It may be that the agent doesnot want these to be realized as consequences of the action. In that case thealternatives are reduced to those paths that lead top, plus those other propertiesthat are at least not inconsistent with the wishes of the agent. If one of these otherproperties is also wanted, then the path that leads to a state that leads to both willbe chosen. In that case we speak of an optimal goal, that is a goal that contains atleast pl plus a maximum of further properties p2, p3, . . . that are also wanted.However, going from the initial to the final state along different paths willseldom be equally easy. That is, some actions will take more time, effort, money,or will involve unwanted intermediary states. The sum of these will, as ineconomic decision theory, be called the cost of each action. A rational agent willin such cases try to reach an optimal goal along the lowest cost path, that is, inthe easiest way. Often things will not be so clearcut Optimal goals may bereached only via high cost paths. The agent will then have to decide, bycomparing costs and goals a meansend analysis, what his or her preferencesare easy actions with minimal goal attainment i.e., at least pl, or maximizingthe goal with further cost.Finally, it should be borne in mind that goals are merely consequences ofactions and hence beyond the control of the agent. In other words, they willobtain with only some degree of probability, depending on other circumstancesof each state in the action sequence. Thus, some action sequences will almostcertainly lead to pl, whereas others have a high chance of failing not in Figure3.1, where each path leads to pl. In many cases, these intermediarycircumstances may not be known to the agent, so that each path choice willdepend on the knowledge and beliefs of the agent about the possible outcomes,consequences, and circumstances of each action. Hence, some paths may beriskier, that is, have lower accumulated probabilities of leading to the desiredgoal. Again, the agent will then have to choose between relatively risky orcertain paths, as compared to relatively optimal final goals.3.2.2. StrategiesAgainst this background of notions from the theory of action we may nowdefine the notion of strategy. We have seen that strategies involve actions, goals,and some notion of optimality Intuitively, a strategy is the idea of an agent about65the best way to act in order to reach a goal. For our purposes we will, indeed,take a strategy to be a cognitive representation of some kind, just as a plan wasdefined as a cognitive representation of some macroaction. Now, whereas a planis a global concept of the macroaction and its final result or goal, a strategy is aglobal representation of the means of reaching that goal. This overall means willdominate a number of lower level, more detailed, decisions and actions. Thus, ifthe strategy is globally characterized by the concept FAST, then at each pointthat action will be taken that leads most quickly to the next stage, and thus to thefinal goal. If the strategy is OPTIMAL GOAL, then at each point a decision willbe made to execute those further actions that lead not only to p1, but also to amaximum number of other desired properties of the state of affairs aimed at.Similarly, we may have a SURE strategy, which involves always choosing theaction alternative that most probably leads to the wanted results, intermediaryand final goals, or a CHEAP strategy which does so at lowest cost. Combinationsare, of course, possible, for example, CHEAPFAST, or SUREEXPENSIVE.Note the difference between a plan and a strategy. A plan is merely a globalrepresentation of an action, for example, Taking a plane to New York. Astrategy, however, is a global mental representation of a style, that is, of a way ofdoing this global action in the most effective way e.g., with low cost, minimumrisk, etc.. Taking a charter flight would be an action appropriate for the CHEAPstrategy of accomplishing the global action, although such a choice may involveloss of time, changing planes, booking long in advance, lack of freedom to alterones plans, etc. Thus, according to our definition, a strategy is not a detailedrepresentation of some action sequence. The reason for this is that, in general,very complex interactions have many as yet unknown intermediarycircumstances and results, so that detailed microstructure planning in advanceis impossible. A strategy is merely a global instruction for each necessary choiceto be made along the path of the course of action whatever happens, alwayschoose the cheapest, fastest, surest, etc., alternative. Just like plans, strategiesmay, of course, be changed along the way A CHEAP strategy may turn out to beso time consuming or risky that the final goal can hardly be reached within somedesired time limit, or with some desired degree of confidence. For the rest of theaction sequence an agent may then change to a less CHEAP, but faster or surer,strategy.In general, plans and strategies will be represented together, as the contentand style of a global action defining an action sequence. The preciserepresentation format does not matter here, nor do the exact cognitive processingaspects, to which we will turn later. At this point, the notion of strategy is stillvery general and abstract. We merely assume that a strategy is a cognitiverepresentation of some kind, that it pertains to complex action sequences, that itis linked to the notion of plan, and that it, therefore, must also be a macronotionIt pertains to a global way of deciding, in advance, which kinds of actionalternatives will be taken along a course of actions. A plan is macroinformationthat decides the possible actions contained in a global action, and a strategy is themacroinformation that determines the choice at each point of the most effectiveor rational alternative.It hardly needs saying that in everyday life we perform many actions without66much of a strategy We may decide at each point which kind of decision tomakealthough even this lack of a strategy may be characterized as a strategyWAITANDSEE. Strategies become necessary as soon as the end goalsbecome extremely important, or the means very costly or risky e.g., ingoverning countries or big organizations, or in making important life decisions.Each local choice of action may conform more or less to the global strategy.We will say that a course of action is strategically coherent if its componentactions are always consistent with the global strategy. This may mean that wehave degrees of strategic coherence. We may deviate more or more often fromthe global strategy. Before we try to focus the notion of strategy on cognition andlanguage use. some further concepts should be introduced that are closely relatedto the notion of strategy.First, we introduce the notion of move. A move in a sequence of interactions is an actionwhich itself may be complex, or even a subsequence ofactionsbut taken from a specific point of view. This point of view we will callfunctional. Thus, a move may be an action that is functional with respect to thedesired final goal of the action sequence Caking an airplane thus may have asmoves going to the airport and boarding the planer But, in general an agent willalso accomplish many actions that are not functional in this way buying anewspaper, having a drink. chatting with a fellow passenger, etc.. In otherwords, a move is any action that is accomplished with the intention of bringingabout a state of affairs that directly or indirectly will probably lead to a desiredglobal goal. For some global actions nearly every action may also be a move, forexample, in playing chess or in conversation. According to our definition ofstrategy, a move thus is not a part of a strategy, but part of an action sequence orglobal action that is dominated by a plan including a representation of a finalgoal and a strategy. Moves. thus, are bound actions, in contrast to free, optionalactions, which may or may not be performed and which do not influence the restof the course of action. A strategy is defined as a cognitive unit dominating onlythe moves of an action sequence and not each action. For instance, traveling toNew York with the CHEAP strategy will influence the choice of a charter flightbut not, for instance, the choice of having a drink at the airport before leavingeven if not having a drink would make the whole trip slightly cheaper. Such achoice is strategically free.Next, we consider the notion of tactics, which sometimes is used as asynonym for strategy. We will, however, reserve the notion of tactics todenote an organized set, a system, of strategies. That is, a strategy applies,just like a plan, to a particular action sequence, and hence to a particular goalto be reached. Just as the various plans of our life may be organized byincreasingly larger plan systems including more or less general life goals, wemay also have systems of strategies which in the same way can be defined asmore or less general lifestyles Schank  Abelson, 1977. Tactics, hence,will be relevant for relatively large segments or periods of our lives andactions. Studying psychology, for instance, may involve a tactic that includesa strategy for studying hard, a strategy that leads to a maximum number offinal goal properties lack of specialization so that it may be easier to find67a job afterward, a strategy to make many friends or a few good friends amongour costudents, ctc. A tactic is not any set of strategies, but a set that hasorganization Some strategies will depend upon others. Studying hard may meanthat makinL, many friends will be difficult due to lack of time for socialinteraction. Bad tactics typically involve conflicting strategies.Whereas a tactic may apply to a global action, such as studying psychology,it may also be used to define a global style of action. For instance, a CHEAPtactic will typically determine for an agent the choice of CHEAP strategies forspecific action sequences. Such overall systems may be related to what istraditionally called the personality of the agent To be thrifty involves amongother things a general constraint on strategies to try to reach ones goals by thecheapest possible course uf action.Another relation exists between strategies and rides von Wright, 1963Lewis, 1969 Collett, 1977. Whereas rules are more or less general conventionsof a Social community regulating behavior in a standard way, strategies areparticular, often personal, ways of using the rules to reach ones goals. Ruleshave been explicitly or implicitly established as norms for possible or correctactions and therefore Lue related to sanctions which are applicable when rulesare broken. Thus we have rules defining games, such as the rules of chess whichdefine the possible moves that may be made in the game, and rules of trafficwhich determine the traffic actions that ran or should be performed. Similarly,rules of language determine which utterances count as correct within a givenlanguage system. So, whereas rules are more general, relatively fixed,prescriptions of correct behavior, strategies pertain to ways of effective behaviorin a certain situation for an individual to reach a goal. Rules, thus, define thepossible moves, whereas strategies determine which choice,, are made among thepossible moves so that the aims of the agent are realized optimally. Later we willcome back in somewhat more detail to the interplay between rules and strategiesof language use and discourse understanding.Whereas rules define the possible moves, the execution of these moves maybe either via strategies or via algorithrns. An algorithm guarantees that the rules,if applied correctly, will eventually produce a solution. Arithmetic calculationsare good examples of commonly used algorithms If the procedures of analgorithm are followed faithfully, step by step, the desired end result will beobtained. However it may take very long to obtain that result, or it may be veryexpensive to execute the steps of the algorithm, so that for all practical purposesthe algorithm is useless. One may know how to compute the result, but givenhuman limits on time and resources, it nevertheless is unobtainable. Strategicapproaches have to take over at this point. Strategic moves are only intelligentguesswork and, unlike algorithmic moves, carry no guarantees, but they make itpossible to solve complex problems given the time and the resources available.The risk is, of course, that they may fail or result in errors. A good strategy issomething that works most of the time, whereas an algorithm always worksbutonly in principle, not in real situations. Strategies are intelligent but riskyalgorithms rely on blind, methodological application of rules.68Finally, another notion often used in relation to, or even as a synonym for,strategies is that of heuristics. We will take a heuristic as a system of discoveryprocedures, that is, as actions that are intended to acquire knowledge aboutconditions that may enable an agent to reach a certain goal, typically in thecontext ol problem solving. A heuristic involves typical kinds of strategies,namely, thusr strategies that aim at the acquisition of knowledge in a context inwhich this knowledge cannot be obtained in automatic, obvious ways. Just aswith strategies in general, this means that we may want to find the desiredinformation in a FAST, but perhaps not very SURE way, or choose a path that israther complicated but that has a higher probability of yielding the necessaryinformation. In this way, we give a global or overall characterization of aheuristic It is a general way of proceeding, a schema for finding something. Analternative way of defining the notion would be to apply it more locally, at themicrolevel. In that case, it would define the full set of intended actions that willbe performed to find some infonnation e.g., as represented in a flow diagram.However, we will use both the notion of strategy and the notion of heuristics todenote only higher level macroschemata for action. The reason for this is that ingeneral, due to circumstances, actions of other agents, or ignorance about thepossible outcomes or consequences of our actions, we arc unable to plan inadvance each detailed action. At most we may have beforehand an idea of whatkind of action we will choose at each point in a course of action.A classic example of the use of heuristics occurs in scientific investigation. Inorder to be able to formulate some regularity or law, we may systematicallyobserve a number of phenomena, or we may first try to derive the regularity fromother regularities and then check our hypothesis with the facts, or we mayemploy a combination of these heuristics. In this example we have a presetschema that controls the way we will look for an answer.3.3. COGNITIVE STRATEGIESThe notion of strategy we have discussed here applies to actions in the strictsense, that is, to overt, intended doings of humans. In psychology, however, thenotion is used also in a more specialized way to denote cognitive behavior ofsome kind. The use of the notion of action, and hence of strategy, is notoriouslyproblematic in this case. We may, of course, speak of mental acts, in which casethese would be open to strategic control. Thinking and problem solving are wellknown examples We have an explicit goal to be reached, the solution of aproblem. and there may be specific operations, mental steps, to be performed toreach that goal. These steps are under our conscious control and we may be atleast partly able to verbalize them, so that we can analyze the strategies followedin solving the problem.Similarly, many of the overt action strategies described in the previous sectionpresuppose thinking We have defined strategy in terms of properties of globalplans, that is, cognitive representations of action sequences and their goals. This69means that our desires or wants are compared to what we know about ourabilities, about the action context, about possibilities or probabilities ofoutcomes, about actions of others. and so on. In other words, a strategy will ingeneral be the result of a mental process involving much information. As soon asthis mental process is consciously controlled, orderly, such that each mental stepyields the information necessary for the next mental step, we may also speak ofmental strategies.However, there are many cognitive activities that do not seem to have thisconscious, orderly, controlled nature. If we look at a landscape, at a movie. orread a text, then we may very well have the overall goal of comprehending, but itcan hardly be said that we have explicitly controlled strategies to reach that goal.Yet there is a sequence of mental operations that allow us to reach that goal, andthese may also be more or less effective. We may also say that we follow astrategy of GOOD understanding or a strategy of FAST understanding.Before we turn to more specific languageunderstanding strategies in the nextsection, let us briefly examine the nature of the more explicit and verbalizablestrategies of problem solving, for example, as discussed by Newell and Simon1972. Although the notion of strategy is used on several occasions in Newelland Simon 1972, there is no explicit definition of it. A strategy will in generalinvolve higher levels of information processing, that is, the highlevel strategicattempts of a problem solver. For instance, a subject will try to analyze aproblem into subproblems if it is rather complex and if it has no obvious, directsolutions. The product of 7 X 5 may be drawn directly from memory, whereas 7X 35 will be computed by most subjects according to the rules of arithmetic.Another general strategic procedure is to compare means and end, that is, toanalyze the nature ot the goal, the final state to be reached by the problemsolving process, and the kind ut steps that may lead there. Third, if a subject doesnot know how to reach some ponit from a starting point, he or she may apply thegeneral strategy of working backward from those intermediary or end points thatare known, a strategy also apphed In cases where errors were made. A very wellknown strategy for cases in which no information at all is available is the trialanderror strategy. Apart from such very general properties of strategies, Newelland Simon 197262 represent a strategy as a production system, which involvesrules that have on the lett of an arrow the information now at hand e.g., thesituation in a game of tic tac toe or chess and on the right the specific move totake at each point of the game. Later pp. 282ff. the authors give a more generaldefinition independent of a particular task and ot a particular production system.Thus, apart from analyzing the problem into suhproblems, a subject will try toobtain new information when needed, will integrate new information found intothe knowledge set, will go back to previous correct Inut disconfirmed states ofthe problem in case an error is reached, will check new information with oldinformation, etc. It is easy to complement this list of general strategies withothers. We may assume, for example, that at each point of a problem whichmay be represented by a graph such as the one given in Figure 3.1, a subjectwill perform forward searches of alternatives in terms of their probability ofsuccess Steps that are deemed most likely to lead to a goal will be preferred or70explored first. If probability of success is believed to be equal, the shortest oreasiest action or operation will be taken. In interactive strategy situations, forexample, those of games like chess, other global strategies will become relevant,such as assumptions about intended actions and hence also about strategies ofother participants, or specific attack or defense strategies such as limiting thechoices of other participants, turning a defense move at the same time into anattack move, and so on.Important for our discussion is that strategies in these cases also involvestepwise, complex acts although these acts are mental that lead to a certaingoal, and that at each point or state of a problem several options are possible andat the same time limited knowledge is available about context,consequences,actions, and other participants. In rather complex problems, part ofthese strategies may be consciously intended. Yet, part of them will also be moreor less automatized, as in standard problems, or at least not explicitly intended.From the preceding discussion it is not completely clear whether strategies haveonly an overall, planned nature. Some of the examples seem to identify strategieswith more local decision procedures for taking next moves. We will, however,provisionally assume, according to our earlier hypothesis, that strategies have ahigher level, general nature,namely, as specific properties of plans that controlthe local steps in problem solving.3.4. LANGUAGE STRATEGIESAs part of the cognitive strategies we will now focus on the more specificstrategies of language use, that is, strategies that are applied by language users inthe production and comprehension of verbal utterances or speech acts of anatural language. Apart from a few general remarks, this section will reviewsome of the sentencebased, grammatical strategies of language users, whereasthe following section and the rest of this book will concentrate on discoursestrategies.First, we again have the general question of whether the notion of strategy isropriate in this case. To a greater extent than complex problem solving, theproduction and comprehension of verbal utterances is an automatized activity.Unless an utterance has specifically difficult, problematic, or unusual properties,production and comprehension is not monitored at each step by the languageuser. If we do not know, the meaning of a word, we may apply the strategy ofasking somebody, consulting a dictionary, or guessing the meaning of the wordfrom context, and if a sentence structure is particularly complex, we mayinwritten conununicationbacktrack and start reading again. Similarly, in discourse,we may have texts that are so complex that various external aids, such asschemata, summaries, or notes, are necessary to control the meaning of the textin production or comprehension. But such devices are rather specialUnderstanding and speaking are usually almost automatic processes.There is also another problem. Unlike the kinds of strategies, both overt and71implicit, that we have discussed thus far, language production and understandingare not really problemsolving strategies. There is no single goal, the goal is nota final state, nor is the goal well defined we do not know if or when we havereached it, unless we take the act of production or comprehension itself to be therelevant global action whose final statedeciding that we have done enoughtoward producing or understanding the utterancecorresponds to the goal. Thus,language production and comprehension, if a problem at all, is a continuous task,consisting of many smallscale problems that together define the problem as awhole.Yet, it makes sense to speak of strategies of language use anyway, althoughthose strategies in most cases will not be preprograrnmed, intended, conscious,or verbalizable by the language user. Rather, we should say, they are strategies ofthe cognitive system, usually beyond the conscious control of the language user.Also, they apply to sequences of mental steps that perform a number of tasks.These task,, are different in nature and scopefor example, identifying sounds orletters, constructing words, analyzing syntactic structures, and understandingsentential or textual meanings. This means that the total task, namely, theproduction or understanding of the utteranceas part of the even larger task ofparticipating in some form of communicative social interactionis a complex taskthat is performed it each component task has been performed. Whereas some ofthese tasks are well defined e.g., identifying a sound, letter, or word, oranalyzing a syntactic structure, others are much less clearcut, especially thesemantic tasks of interpreting sentences or whole texts. It is a notoriouslydifficult problem both for linguistics and for psychology to determine what asemantic representation is how much, hoti deep, how elaborate, should such arepresentation be, and how much of episodic memories or general worldknowledge should it include Understanding language is a fuzzy task, and thecommunicative context will determine how much fuzziness is allowed forappropriate understanding and communication. Thus, we know that somesubtasks belong to the overall task e.g., understanding words and sentences.whereas others are much less obviously related to the task e.g., understandingbackgrounds or ideologies, or associating personal memories when reading anewspaper story.The reasons, then, that we may still speak of strategies when referring tospecific kinds of cognitive processing in using language may be summed up asfollows1. In both the production and comprehension of verbal utterances as speechacts in some communicative context, the language user is confronted with theexecution or understanding of an action.2. Such an action has a rather welldefined initial state or starting point.3. The action has an end point or goal, although this goal will often be fuzzyIn addition to having said or having read something, which are rather welldefined final goals, we have meaning or intending something, and understanding such meanings or intentions, or understanding in an even broadersense.724. The task is complex. It consists of a number of subtasks that must befulfilled.5. The solution of the task occurs step by step We cannot produce or understand an utterance by accomplishing just one task.6. In general, the component tasks are not obvious Information may be lacking or not readily available, and alternative routes options are possible.These are some general criteria that allow us to speak of strategies whenlanguage use is concerned. Later we will see that the nature of the strategies isindeed sufficiently general to make the notion interesting. If we chose a strictdefinition of strategy we would apply the notion of strategy only to complexovert actions. Then, perhaps, listening and interpreting would not be consideredan action at all but just some activity that cannot be controlled in a stepwisefashion as actions can. In this case, the notion of language strategy becomes ametaphor, applying not only to mental acts, as in difficult problem solving, butalso to mental activities, such as the processes in the production or understandingof language. Instead of strategies of an agent, or language user, we would thenspeak of strategies of a system. Just like agents, such systems should exhibit thecrucial notion of effectivcness that we have taken as the explanandum of a theoryof strategies. Thus, language strategies are being postulated because we assumethat the language user as an agent and his or her cognitive system will try toperform their tasks as quickly, as well, as easily, as cheaply, etc., as possible.There is another reason to speak of strategies when dealing with languageuse. We postulate language strategies as a complement to an account of verbalbehavior in terms of rules. Rules of language, for instance, those of a grammar,whether explicitly formulated or not, have by definition a general nature. Forsome level of the utterance, it is specified what the possible, or correct, structuresare, for example, those of phonology, morphology, or syntax or what thepossible meanings or functions are, as in semantics and pragmatics. A rule has ageneral and abstract nature, and represents, in rather idealistic terms, whatlanguage users in general do or what they implicitly or explicitly think they do orshould do. Opposed to this are the possible uses of the rule, which may dependon context, on the particular language user, or on communicative goals, andwhich are variable. Whereas rules of language account for some rather generalnorm, that is, formulate what is held to be correct by language users of a certaingroup in certain contexts, a language strategy accounts for what is effective, forexample, for producing or understanding correct utterances in a certain way. Oneof the main reasons why strategies are necessary in addition to the rules oflanguage lies in the specific processing features of natural language utterances1. Language users have limited memory, and, especially, a limited shorttimememory capacity.2. Language users cannot process many different kinds of information at thesame time.733. Production and understanding of utterances is linear, whereas most of thestructures the rules pertain to are hierarchical.4. Production and understanding require not only linguistic or grammaticalinformation, but other information as well, for example, information aboutthe context, episodic memories, knowledge of the world, intentions, plansand goals, and so on.So, whereas rules are abstract and are therefore formulated a posteriori forcomplete structures, at various levels, and for various scopes, strategies arenecessary to allow a language user to accomplish the task of production orunderstanding linearly, at several levels, simultaneously taking into accountdifferent kinds of information, and with limited knowledge. Rules are notformulated for this kind of complex task, but strategies should be such that theysatisfy the various condition, formulated here. As we go along, we will add somefurther characteristics of language strategies.3.5. GRAMMATICAL STRATEGIESWe use the term grammatical strategies, or sentence strategies, although itshould be kept in mind that these are not strategies that are formulated by theUrammar, but cognitive strategies that are used to produce or understandstructures that are specified by the rules of the grammar.It is at this point that the difference between the notions of rule and strategybecome most obvious. Even if we accept the hypothesis that a grammar is atheoreticaland hence general, abstract, and idealizedreconstruction of the lanOuage rules known by language users, there is still a crucial difference betweengrammatical rules on the one hand and strategies on the other.Typically, rules apply to structures taken as complete entities, a posteriori.For hoth synthetic and analytic types of rules in sentence grammars or cognitivemodels, the categories and units are typically structural. They characterize asyntactic sentence structure as a whole. Thus, a NPVP categorical analysis of asentence pertains to the sentence as a whole or to a clause as a whole, and notto serially processed linguistic units, that is, to units as they are understood orprocessed by a language user in real time. Strategies pertain to the latter kind oflinear processing, that is, to information that a language user processesfragmentarily. This does not mean that strategies do not also imply higher levelstructures, or that parallel processing would be excluded in a cognitive model oflanguage use, but rather that the data are processed in real time. Once therelevant data are processed, a language user may use rules to check whether thestrategies have been correctly applied.From this latter aspect we see that strategies and rules are not independent. Intact, this would be highly uneconomical for the cognitive system. We may assume,thus, that the categories and units on which they operate are roughly the same. If we74know the units to which rules apply, it would be strange indeed if strategies didnot make use of the same units also, at least in part. In other words, a languageuser will generally try to respect word boundaries in applying fast strategies forthe semantic interpretation of a sentence, although there are times when he or shewill jump to a conclusion about the meaning of a word after having analyzedonly part ofit. This is possible, for instance, in cases of wellfoundedexpectations about meanings ot words as derived from the meaning of theprevious part of the text or from the context. In this example we witness a typicalfurther characteristic of grammatical strategies They are not limited to the use ofrulegoverned information from the cognitive grammar and its specific levels,units, or categories e.g., morphology or syntax, but will at the same time useinformation from other levels or even from the communicative context.Furthermore, strategies appear to be hypothetical, probabilistic They make fastbut effective guesses about the most likely structure or meaning of the incomingdata. These guesses may, of course, be wrong. In that case, the grammatical ruleswill establishon second analysisthe correct structure or meaning. Anotherinteraction between rules and strategies may be called schematical. Althoughtheoretically and also empirically all or most of our sentences will be unique,especially if they are rather long, it goes without saying that many of them willshow grammatical patterns that are very similar or identical. This means that alanguage user, after years of experience, may form schemata for these linguisticpatterns. The schemata themselves are, of course, developed on the basis ofrules, but their use is strategic As soon as data are analyzed that conform to theterminal categories of the schema, then the sentence will be analyzed accordingto the schema. Here we witness an intermediary phase between rules andstrategies. namely, a kind of preprogramming of rules, to be strategically appliedas soon as the input data appear to be standard. From this perspective,psycholinguistics in the last 10 years has developed a number of hypothesesabout effective grammatical strategies or schemata for the production, andespecially the understanding, of sentences. Although experimental confirmationof these hypotheses has proven to be notoriously difficult, and althoughsometimes conflicting results have been obtained, there are a number ofstrategies that are fairly well established, as indicated in the previous chapter.If we forget for a moment the phonological and morphological strategies andfocus upon syntactic strategies for sentence understanding, we find that earliermodels of sentence recognition, namely, those closely linked to the framework oftransformational grammar, should be discarded as plausible models of sentenceprocessing Fodor, Bever,  Garrett, 1974. That is, models that somehowthroughanalysis by analysis or analysis by synthesistry to match an input string of lexicalitems to structures generated by grammatical rules, quickly run into trouble. Evenfor moderately complex sentences the number of possible structural descriptionstrees is astronomically high, and effective search among such possiblestructures would be impossible. Fodor, Bever, and Garret 1974328ff. opt for amodel that is less close to the grammar, although it is still level specific. Themodel gives a strategy for syntactic analysisa strategy that does not at the same75time operate on or with other kinds of information. such as semantic, contextual,or epistemic world knowledge information. It is assumed that analysis isclausal A language user first tries to discover the clauses of a sentence, byinterpreting clause boundary signals of various kinds. These clauses are assumedto be the surface representation of underlying sentoids of the deep structure theauthors still differentiate between surface and deep structure for syntacticdescription and understanding. Information about the internal structure of eachclause is then gathered in the shortterm memory buffer, and as soon as theclause has been interpreted, this information is erased from the store so that newinformation can be stored. The relations between the interpreted clauses can thenbe established. Each clause v ill be strategically interpreted by a canonicalsentoid analysis of the NPVPNP type, whereas a lexical strategy determineswhich relations exist between the clauaes. For example, some verbs are known tooften have thatcomplements, for instance, see, hear, suppose, or doubt, andsimilar observations might be made for connectives such as although, because,or but. But this is still much too simplistic the strategy would fail in many cases.Because that may not always occur in tile surface structure, we must have astrategy for recognizing whether a verb is part of a main or a subordinated clausee.g., by assuming that a first verb, after an NP, will be the verb of the mainclause, unless there is a mark for subordination in the surface structure.Important for our discussion is the conclusion of the authors p. 369 that thesentence recognition device, that is, the system of strategies used inunderstanding a sentence, is not closely bound to the system of grammaticalrules, but that the system has its own cognitive properties.Although this model is already notably distant from a transformationalgrammarbased recognition model, it still carries some of the distinctive properties oftransformational grammar. Mainly, it is, as we already suggested, stillsyntactically based It tries to establish syntactic structures before even lookingat the semantic or pragmatic information available to a language user. Yet it isprecisely that infonnation that yields powerful expectations about the meaning ofa sentence and therefore also about the correct surface analysis of a sentence.Moreover, morphophonemic surface signals for syntactic structures are few andoften difficult to perceive in natural speech. Hence, a semantically andpragmatically based system of strategies seems to be more effective, or as Clarkand Clark 1977 put itListeners usually know a lot about what a speaker is going to say. They can makeshrewd guesses from what has just been said and from the situation being described.They can also be confident that the speaker will make sense, be relevant. provideLiven and new, information appropriatcly, and in eeneral be cooperative. Listenersalmost certainly use this sort of information to select among alternatives parses of asentence, to anticipate words and phrases. and sometimes even to circumventsyntactic analyses altogether. Just how is not very clear p. 72.Clark and Clark 197772ff. therefore make a distinction between two verybasic principles, which we might take as characterizing two kinds of strategiesthereality principle and the cooperative principle. The reality principle pertains to the76close relationships that exist between meaning, reference, and our knowledgeabout possible states of affairs in the world. Since we make intelligent guessesabout a situation or event a speaker is referring to, we also have some idea aboutwhat the speaker could possibly mean, that is, we have a range of possiblesemantic readings for the sentence. These assumptions may, in turn, be matchedwith strategic analyses at the syntactic levelif these latter are still needed at all.The cooperative principleas adopted from Grice 1967assumes that speakers ingeneral trv to make sense, want to be cooperative, and do this by being truthful,being clear, saying no more nor less than is meant, and trying to be relevant.Hence, the first principle can be called semantic and the second pragmatic. Apartfrom the general principles of cooperation, we may have expectations about thepossible speech acts of a speaker a promise, a threat, depending on an analysisof the context see van Dijk, 1981a. This, in turn, presupposes specificmeanings propositions of sentences and clauses, whereas we also haveinformation about a still wider interactional, social, and cultural context. Fromthose we may infer expectations about possible speech acts, about possiblemeanings, about possible themes see Section b on discourse, in this chapter,about style e.g., as dependent on the social anti personal contexts, and henceabout matching surface structures. Hence, the two principles mentioned by Clarkand Clark 1977 may be formulated in a still broader framework, a frameworkthat is still further away from grammar, involving world knowledge, andknowledge about the social, personal, and cultural contexts ol communication.We may assume that there is a hierarchy in these systems and theil concomitantstrategies Interactional strategies will probably dominate pragmatic ones,pragmatic speech act comprehension strategies the semantic ones, and thesemantic strategies the syntactic and other surface structure strategies of analysis.This assumption about the hierarchical ordering of strategy systems of language understanding should be handled with care, however. It does not meanthat u language user will always and for each sentence first apply allinteractional, pragmatic, etc., strategies. Sometimes the knowledge about thewider context is nut relevant, or is already established and functioning only as abackground monitoring device. And, more importantly, it may be more effectiveto try to assemble some directly available information from the utterance than toscan the wider contextual possibilities. As we have assumed, strategies areflexible, they use several kinds ut information at the same time, and they adapt tocontinuing changes in the ongoing utterance and context. To establish whichspeech act is now being performed, the hearer will, of course, make a systematicanalysis of the interactional contextdetermining a class of possible speech actsbut at the same time will try to get semantic or even surface structureinformation that manifests or signals the speech act in the utterance Verbs,tenses, syntactic structure, and propositional content can all be used to decidewhat the speech act is that is now being performed. The hierarchy should thus beunderstood as a device that effectively narrows the scope of the operation offollowing strategies. If a specific context makes the speech act uf a commandhighly unlikely, we will not even try, on first analysis, to semanticallyunderstand or syntactically parse the sentence according to a strategy that relates77form and meaning with such a speech act. And, conversely, if the broaderhigher level yields a rather probable hypothesis about the relevant speech act,then the rest of the analysis may directly focus on the meaning and referencecontentif that cannot be predicted from a semantic strategy operating on worldknowledge. In other words, a hierarchical ordering of language understandingstrategies has two complementary basic features It narrows down the scope forthe operation of lowerlevel strategies, or it provides possible direct guesseswhich may make the operation of further strategic analysis partly unnecessary, atleast until conflicting information is encountered.Returning briefly to semantic strategies of sentence understanding, weobserve that Clark and Clark 197773ff. use the reality principle to limit thescope of possible meanings for sentences, and we next assume that a schematicanalysis of the sentence or clause takes place that is like the semantic counterpartof the clause analysis for syntax we have met earlier. A language user will firstlook for a main verb, interpret that as an expression of an underlying predicate,and then search for the surface structure elements that express the normalcategories arguments that go with the verb. Thus, the verb or predicate to hitwill require an agent, an object. and possibly an instrument. These may beexpressed by noun phrases in surface structure. Moreover, there is for eachlanguage a preferential ordering for such noun phrases see also Dik, 1978,1980, such that the agentexpressing noun phrase will typically be the subject ofthe sentence, which will often be realized first.We see that semantic strategies may be schematic, in the sense that theymake use of canonical semantic structures of propositions, and that thesestrategies will cooperate with surface structure information, whereas both arecontrolled by our knowledge of the actual or wider social, cultural contextswho is now agent in this context, who could be agent, what kind of actions arepossible or probable, etc.and the same for other possible participants in an eventa sentence is referring to.From this brief discussion of some of the strategies and principles used incognitive models for the understanding of language we may first of all concludethat strategies are indeed a fundamental component of our cognitive ability touse understand and produce language utterances. Second, these strategies areparts of sets that are ordered hierarchically. Third, the strategies are flexible,operate at several levels at the same time, use incomplete information, andcombine bottomup inductive and topdown deductive ways of processinginformation. And, fourth, they are context sensitive Depending on the attention,interests, goals, beliefs, attitudes, or opinions of the language user, anddepending on the actual interactiona and social contextas cognitivelyrepresented by the language userthe strategies may be changed. For instance,sometimes it will be more important to establish what kind a speech act is beingperformed by a speaker, on other occasions the precise semantic content of aspeech act may be more relevant, and, on yet other occasions the specific surfacestructure or style may be most relevant and hence focused upon.One basic way in which the principles and strategies mentioned here arecontext sensitive is in their dependence on text or discourse. That is, a speech act or78meaning conveyed by a clause or sentence will typically depend on those occurringearlier in the same monological or dialogical discourse. Just as it is highly unlikclythat word recognition strategies operate independently of sentence recognitionstrategies, sentence strategies will be very much dependent on textual strategies.Given that phonology and syntax are somewhat more closely linked to sententialstructuresalthough there are also phonological and syntactic constraints acrosssentence boundarieswe may expect textual strategies to influence the semantic andpragmatic strategies of the sentence level. In the following section we will give asurvey of some arguments regarding discourse strategies of different kinds andtheir relationship to sentenceunderstanding strategies. In later chapters we willthen treat some of these textual strategies in more detail.3.6. DISCOURSE STRATEGIESStrategies for the production and comprehension of discourse are similar tothose used in the comprehension of sentences. Language users alwaysmanipulate surface structures, word, phrase, and clause meanings, pragmaticinformation from the context, as well as interactional, social, and cultural data.That is, a language user will try to effectively assess the meanings of parts ofthe discourse, corrcsponding reference, pragmatic functions or speech act valuesof parts of the discourse, as well as other interactional, social, and culturalfunctions. Hence, a number of the fundamental principles are those we havealready discussed. Moreover, as we have also observed, sentence strategies areclosely linked to discourse strategies The production and comprehension ofsentences depends on textual information of a larger scope or of a higher level.Conversely, the semantic and pragmatic interpretation of the discourse will havesentential information as input. This is precisely as it should be. One of thefundamental properties of strategies is that they are not independent, contrary tomany grammatical rules.Yet, there are a number of discourse strategies that need to be formulated intheir own right, in part because sentence strategies may in turn depend on them.Clark and Clark 197776 give an example of this interdependence. 1  a. Claire and Kent climbed Mt. McKinley last summer.b. She photographed the peak, and he surveyed it.To establish the meaning and reference of 1b, and in particular that of itsreferring phrases she, the peak, he, and it, a language user does not have to makea largescale search in memory for the possible referents of these expressionsThe previous sentence immediately yields the information needed search forappropriate referents can, in this example, be strategically limited to the small seto1 referents introduced by this previous part of the discourse. Of course, tilestratcgy becomes much more complex when there are several sentencespreceding and when the referents must be sought in larger chunks of previousdiscourse. Also, the strategy as is may not be powerful enough. Consider, forexample, the following continuation sentences791 b. They didnt like it very much.b. It was their last holiday.Here the reference of it cannot easily be established by coreference with Mt.McKinley In 1b it may refer to the mountain, but also to the climbing in 1bit may be taken to refer to the whole previous event or as an empty pronounintroducing holiday as in It was o very cold day. We see that even for a verysimple discourse and for a limited problem, the establishment of coreference, wesoon get into a rather thorny issue. Moreover, in our example taken from Clark andClark it should also be stressed that a simple search for appropriate referents is notenough. The interpretation of the the peak will also require sonic information fromworld knowledge, namely, the fact that a mountain has a peak. This implicitinformation, signaled by the definite noun phrase the, is assumed by the speaker tobe know n to the hearer. The strategy therefore also requires searching relevantknowledge of the world and drawing correct inferences from it.Even from this initial example we can conclude that semantic discoursestrategies involve at least the following principles1. Both meaning and reference information needed to interpret a sentencemay be searched for in the representation of one or more previous sentence.2. Part of the information for semantic interpretation must be sought for in orinferred from general world knowledge.3. Search in both cases will also depend on the meaning of the rest of thesentence being interpreted.A more general principle dominating these principles is the very assumption thatin successive sentences of a discourse the referring phrases may be coreferentialand that, more generally, two successive sentences are coherent.Extensive work in text linguistics and the psychology of discoursecomprehencin see Chapter 2 has resulted in the formulation of rules andconditions for this kind of discourse coherence, both in terms of semantics andpragmatics and in terms of world knowledge. It has been assumed that inaddition to this structural approach we now also need a system of strategies asused by speakers and hearers to establish, construct, discover, or recognize thisfundamental property of discourse.In order to formulate such strategies we should first realize what coherenceintuitively means for language users. If predicated of a sentence, it may mean, forinstance, that it is a normal, possible, understandable, or correct continuation withrepespect to already producedreadheard parts of ongoing discourse. Morespecificaly, coherence may be taken as a condition on good semantic meaning andreference  continuation of a sentence with respect to previous discourse. In otherwords, it must be possible for the language user to establish semantic relationsbetween a sentence and previous discourse. On the other hand, coherence may alsobe taken as predicated not of a sentence, but of pairs, triples,..., ntuples of sentencesor of fragments or the whole of a discourse. In that case, the intuitive notion involvedis wut of unity The respective sentences belong together, can appropriately beused together as one whole and in one utterance. And third, coherence may also be80predicated of a sentence relative to this whole. In that case, the sentence fits wellinto the whole discourse. Coherence conditions have been discussed in moredetail in van Dijk 1977a.We have seen in Chapter 2 that these intuitive notions that underlie discoursestrategies can be theoretically represented in terms of local and global semanticproperties of a discourse, that is, in terms of semantic relations betweensentences and in terms of rules relating sentences or ntuples of sentences withsemantic macrostructures.The question now is how to reformulate these conditions and rules in terms oistrategies. Furthermore, we must determine what other textual strategies are involved in the production and comprehension of discoursesurface structure strategies, as well as the more general strategies of knowledge use and the use ofcontextual information speech act, interaction, personal, social, and culturalsituation. Although it is impossible to be complete, we will draw a list of thekinds of strategies that may be used in the processing of discourse. Only some ofthese strategy classes will be studied in more detail in the following chapters. Itshould therefore be borne in mind that the strategies we discuss later areintimately tied to the other kinds of strategies listed in this section. Note that thenames of the strategy classes and subclasses are a convenient shorthand, so thatwe can easily refer back to them in the rest of the book without explaining indetail what kind of strategy is involved. We will follow the hierarchy discussedearlier, that is, we will start with the strategy types of the largest scope, in otherwords, those strategies that are most fundamental to understanding in general,both of language and of other semiotic practices, of interactions, events, andobjects. Our formulation, however, will be focusing on the relevance of thesestrategies to the processing of discourse. In particular, we shall restrict thespecification to strategies of understanding, although similar strategies may beformulated for production.Finally, it should be stressed that the various strategies are of a cognitivenature. They operate on cognitively represented information actualized fromlongterm memory. The cultural and social information discussed earlier isassumed to have been acquired through learning processes general knowledgeor to be representations of actual social situations.3.6.1. Cultural StrategiesCultural strategies are those strategies that pertain to the effective selection ofcultural information that is relevant to the comprehension of the discourse. Thesestrategies may be speaker or hearer oriented. That is, a hearerreader may use theinformation about the cultural background of the speakerauthor or the productionconditions of a discourse, or may address the information of his or her own culturalbackground and the specific understanding, or reception conditions, of a discourse.Often, especially in everyday conversation, the two perspectives will coincideSpeaker and hearer belong to the same culture of the same time period. Speakingwith members of another culture, or reading myths, stories, or documents of other81cultures or of the same culture from a different period, requires a differentiationin cultural strategies Bauman  Sherzer, 1974 Chafe, 1979. We may assumethat heareroriented cultural strategies will dominate the speakeroriented onesEven if we are able to address knowledge or beliefs about the culturalbackgrounds of the speaker of another culture we will tend to do so from theperspective of our own cultural background. This means that understandingdiscourse from other cultures may be a process that is marked. Whereas for ourown culture comprehension automatically presupposes information about theculture, understanding discourse from other cultures requires specific processingof knowledge or beliefs we have about these other cultures or at leastassumptions about various kinds of differences we do not know about.Cultural strategies have a very wide scope. They involve knowledge aboutdifferent geographical areas and locations, different social structures, institutions.and events, different communicative events, different languages, different discourse types, different speech acts, different superstructures e.g., different narrative schemata, different local and global coherence conditions, different stylesand rhetorics, different symbolic or ritual values and functions, differentknowledge. beliefs, opinions, attitudes, ideologies, norms, and values as well astheir implicit or explicit use in the production of the discourse, a differentconceptual ordering of the world and society and hence different lexicons, and,finally, different objects of reference. Even if this list is not complete, we seealready that all aspects o1 discourse understanding are directly or indirectlyaffected by the kind of strategic uses of cultural information. Not only on atrivial level may the language itself be different, but also surface structure, style,coherence conditions, themes, discourse types, meanings, and pragmatic andinteractional functions are influenced by cultural background. Understanding adiscourse according to these cultural strategies hence means that we relate allthese levels and dimensions with what we know about the communicativefeatures of the culture of the speaker.Marked i.e., different culture cultural strategies typically involve partialunderstanding. Most hearers or readers will only have limited knowledge aboutthe other culture, so that sometimes guesses must be made about precise wordmeanings, coherence conditions, implicit beliefs, and pragmatic or interactionalfunctions of the discourse.We may now summarize these points into a most general principle or superstrategy dominating these cultural strategies Understand the discourse, both textuallyand contextually, according to what you the hearer believe to be the cultural contextof the communicative situation in which or for which the discourse has beenproduced or used. Under this principle, we will then use strategies that enable us toknow, for instance, that telling a story in another culture, and in a specific socialcontext, may not only mean that the speaker wants to amuse the listener, but mayalso, perhaps, be intended to make a reproach, to give advice, or to reaffirm basicnorms of a group or teach its history. Another example is the derivation of macrostructures themes from the discourse. These are sensitive to what in a certainculture is believed to be important, relevant, interesting, or otherwise prominent82information in discourse. Lack of appropriate cultural information of this typemay mean that we think the discourse has no point, or that we do not understandwhy a story is interesting Kintsch  Greene, 1978. Specifically, we need toknow which sequences of events or actions and their descriptions can be taken tomanifest a higher level event or action which does not have a comparableconceptualization in our culture.3.6.2. Social StrategiesPart of the cultural strategies mentioned here pertain to more specific socialstrategies. That is, we must assume in understanding a discourse that it isproduced and used within a larger social context or at a more local socialoccasion Sudnow, 1972 Scherer  Giles, 1979. These social strategies involveinformation about the general social structure of a group, about institutions,roles, or functions of participants, discourse genres of institutions or socialoccasions, style differences related to social structure, occasion, or socialmembers, possible speech acts that can be performed on those occasions and bythose members, and the social norms, conventions, values, or ideologies of thosemembers. In other words, we must apply different strategies when understanding adiscourse produced by the government, a bank, a judge in the courtroom, a studentin our class, a friend in a bar, or our child at the breakfast table. The strategicnature of the understanding process lies in tile fact that we activate different kindsof expectations about possible interactional functions intentions, speech acts,global themes, discourse types, coherence, styles, etc. From a government or bankwe do not expect stories, but laws, documents, or reportsdiscourse types we, inturn, do not expect from friends or family members in everyday conversation.Also the status of the discourses may be different with regard to the intendedrights, duties, or ensuing actions We must obey the law, but not a request from astranger. We know, similarly, that we must obey an order of a judge orpoliceman on duty but not an order by the same person in an offduty situation.These examples show that a language understander has a strategy to limit theinterpretation of many aspects of the discourse to rather restricted sets.Assumptions may be made about the intended social function status of thediscourse, about the possible speech acts, possible macrostructures, possiblediscourse types, and possible styles of the discourse. Apart from differentinstitutions or context types, these expectations may depend on assumptionsabout the member categories in these social contexts, that is, on whether we arecommunicating with a man or a woman, a child or an adult, a young or an oldperson, a friend or a stranger, a rich or a poor person, with people having more orless power or status than we, and so on.3.6.3. Interactional StrategiesThe more general social and cultural strategies provide the basic backgroundinformation for the specific strategies used in communicative situations. The hearer83or reader of a discourse is now not an observer of the social or cultural contexts,but a direct participant in the communicative relationship The discourse isaddressed to, intended for, him or her. We also assume that the communicativeprocess is a form of social interaction and at the same time a coherent part oflarger interaction sequences. This may mean that the discourse, as an act, ismeant to affect further verbal or nonverbal actions or their conditions, such as theknowledge, beliefs, opinions, or motivations of the hearer.To understand a discourse strategically as an action in an ongoing socialinteraction sequence means that the hearer makes assumptions about the intentions,purposes represented goals, wishes, preferences, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, ideology, emotions, and personality of the speaker. This information may be drawntrom episodic memory already established on other occasions about the speaker, orhe inferred from the representation of the actual social context and communicativesituation. Thus, from an obviously lost stranger in our town, heading for us andspeaking to us, we may expect a request for information about the location of streetsor buildings. Wishes, purpose of speaking, and intention of the speech act may beinferred even before we hear the particular request. We know that the speaker.iasumes that we can and will give that information, that is, that the action is meantto lead to specific other actions. Hence, an interactional strategy for discourseunderstanding means that a hearer derives effective expectations from the global orlocal social context with respect to the interactive intentions, goals, and motivationsaf the speaker as they relate to cognitive or actional changes of the hearer.Just as was the case for the more general social and cultural strategies,interactiunal strategies may yield or require information from all discourselevels a specific range of possible speech acts, possible themes, or a specificstyle. In case of the stranger, we may expect a request as a speech act, a themeabout being lost and location, and polite style. These expectations will monitorthe more specific discourse analysis strategies.Similarly, the understanding strategy at this level will make assumptionsabout the interactional function of the discourse. Thus, the discourse may beunderstoodgiven beliefs about the social situation and the personality of thespeakeras an attack, a defense, as aggressive, as helping, as cooperative, asobstructive, or as facilitating with respect to the interactional sequence. In thisrespect the strategy may involve assumptions about the interactive strategies ofthe speaker, that is, the strategies to be specified in a production model ofdiscourse.3.6.4. Pragmatic StrategiesOne specific type of interactional strategies are the pragmatic strategies. Whereasthe other strategies mentioned thus far have a more general nature i.e., they governcomprehension processes in general, pragmatic strategies are bound to naturallanguage. Although the notion of pragmatics is often used vaguely to denote allcontextual aspects of language use, we will limit it to the subtheory of linguisticsthat is concerned with the study of language utterances as speech acts. A speech act84can be loosely defined as the social action that is performed by a speaker whenproducing an utterance in some specific context. Promises, threats, andcongratulations are such social actions, performed by language users. Thesespeech acts are said to be appropriate if a number of contextual conditions aresatisfied. These conditions pertain to the wants, beliefs, and intentions of thespeaker and to a limited number of social relations between speaker and hearer,such as rank and familiarity. In particular, a pragmatic theory specifies whatproperties of an utterance can be related to its specific pragmatic function as aspeech act Surface structure and semantic structure e.g., time, action, andreference to speaker or hearer may thus constrain the possible speech acts.A cognitive model of pragmatics should, among other things, specify how theutterances of a language user can be comprehended as specific speech acts vanDijk, 1981a Chapter 9.. How does a hearer know that an utterance such as Canyou lend me that book can be taken, in a specific context, as a requestWe assume that a language user, apart from applying pragmatic rules, need,strategies to accomplish this rather complex task. At the discourse level, thismean, that a language user is able to infer from text and context not only whichspeech acts are performed by the individual sentences of the discourse, but alsothe pragmatic status of the discourse as a wholethat is, what possiblemacrospeech acts are being performed. The reason to assume that strategies arenecessary here, both tot sentences and for discourse, is that it seems likely that ahearer will in general not wait until the end of the utterance to infer what speechact is being performed. Especially for longer discourses, this would seem highlyimprobable. After a few sentences, the hearer can often guess what the speaker isdriving atpragmatically speaking, that is, what he or she is intending and doinge.g., promising something, making a request, or making an accusation. Anearly guess of this kind will enable the hearer to design his or her own strategiesfor appropriate production.Hence, pragmatic discourse strategies involve several tasks the hearer mustdecide a what speech acts are being performed by the individual sentences orclauses of the discourse, b what pragmatic relations exist between these localspeech acts, c what global or macro speech act is being performed by largerparts of the discourse or by the discourse as a whole, d what the relations arebetween local and global speech act sequences, and e what the relations arebetween the global speech acts. It is obvious that these are fairly complex taskawhich require elaborate cognitive computing.We assume that pragmatic strategies, which link textual structures with context,especially the interactional context, combine two kinds of information, namely,properties of the utterance and properties of the pragmatic context for details, seevan Dijk, 1977a, 1981a. Our hierarchical treatment of discourse comprehensionstrategies implies that the contextual information has priority. This is indeedplausible A systematic analysis of the relevant context may enable a language userto make intelligent guesses about the possible speech acts that can be expectedfrom a speaker. From the strangerintown example of the previous section, wemay conclude that certain contexts greatly limit the possible speech acts e.g., to a85request, rather than an assertion or accusation. If we know what the socialsituation is, if we can infer what the wishes and intentions of an agentspeakerare, and if we know what our relation with the speaker is, we can often alreadyguess what is going to happen even before the speaker actually performs thespeech act.We further assume that the hearers search through available social andinteractional information in order to predict possible speech acts is not arbitrarybut systematic. There are many social properties of the context that are notrelevant for the interpretation or evaluation of a speech act. Therefore, we use theterm pragmatic context to denote those contextual features that are relevant forpragmatic interpretation. Whereas sex differences will in general notsystematically define difterent appropriateness conditions for speech acts thereare no speech acts, in our ulture, that are used only by men or only by women,relationships of power or familiarity do define such conditions commands, forinstance, are appropriately given only by superiors, and many types ofcongratulations or compliments require at least some degree of mutualacquaintance. Similarly, the pragmatic context will he scanned for a restrictednumber of cognitive properties of the speaker, such as his or her actual wishes,purposes, and intentions, on the one hand, and beliefs and evaluations, on theother. Thus, in a request, we must presuppose that a speaker wants somethingdone by us, which in turn presupposes that we assume that the speaker believesthat we can and are willing to do this. In accusations and congratulations, weassume that the speaker has some negative or positive evaluation about our pastactions. We see that some assumptions about the past, actual, and future actioncontext and about some cognitive states of the speaker relative to this contextalready allow us to make rather wellspecified inferences about possible speechact types.Although in some cases this kind of systematic contextual search allows anearer to make a good guess about the speech act that is going to be performed,usually the hearer will need more information. This information, of course, willhave to come from the utterance itself. Again we assume that the pragmatic strategies involved will not blindly scan all the structural information of the discourseprocessed so far. It is much more effective to search a partial textual representationas it is being processed in shortterm memory for specific pragmatic signals. Thesesignals may be both superstructural and semantic A specific intonation may distinguish assertions from requests and questions, or praise from accusations wordorder, as well, indicates differences between assertions and questions or requestsaction verbs in general will indicate actionrelated speech acts, such as promises,threats, accusations, or requests tense and time will indicate past, future, or presentsctions, which is relevant to distinguish between promises and excuses, or betweenthreats and accusations. Similarly, references I, you to speaker and hearer willdetermine the agents or other participant roles in these actions, whereas expressionssuch as rather, like, and other opinion words may indicate evaluations or preferencesof the speaker, defining advice, congratulation, or accusations. We have no ideawhich specific order or hierarchy will be followed by these textual pragmaticcomprehension strategies. According to our hierarchy hypothesis, it would be the86most informative information that is scanned first, which would be the semanticinformation. Yet, this information can only be acquired, at least in part, throughsurface structure interpretation. So, the very use, say, of pronouns such as I andyou as first mentioned NPs or subjects will already give some information aboutparticipant relations in the action described, and hence possibly on the speech actbeing performed. However, this strategy will probably work only in a few casesand will usually require at feast partial interpretation of the predicate A sentencebeginnin with I ... may express nearly any speech act. Yet, a sentence beginningwith I am ... will very often be an assertion, and I want ... very often a requestquestion, or command, whereas You are ... merely will define the class of evaluative speech acts, which includes such different ones as accusations, praise, congratulations, or compliments. Hence, although some partial surface and semantic processing will sometimes yield indications of possible speech act classes, we will ifgeneral need the full clausal propositional structure in order to decide what thespeech act is. This is natural because, first of all, relevant pragmatic intonationincludes a clause or sentence as a whole, relevant time and place indicators maysometimes occur at the end, and the further participants in the event or actionmay also occur rather late in clause or sentence at least in English.The second class of pragmatic strategies will need to link thus interpretedspeech acts into coherent sequences. That is, the hearer will assume not only thatthe meanings and references of the various sentences of a discourse are meaningfully related, but also that the speech acts being performed by their utterancearc as well. Strategics governing speech act sequences may be understood in thelight ut a broader theory of planning and understanding action and interactionsequences in general. Just as we understand successive actions of agents to bemeaningfully related, for example, with respect to some goal, we make theassumption that successive speech acts are related. Consider sequences such asthe following2 a. Youve done a swell job.b. Ill pay you double.3 a. It is cold in here.b. Can you please shut the windowPerformed by the same speaker, each of these two examples of speech actsequences can be coherently understood by a hearer if it is assumed that thespeech act performed first is a condition for the production, and hence for thecomprehension, of the speech act that follows. Thus, praise may establish asituation in which a speaker may feel indebted to a hearer, which is a situationin which a promise mav be appropriate. Similarly, an assertion about somewant, lack, or need may be a condition for the appropriate request that follows.In both examples, a hearer may make strategic guesses about the possiblepragmatic functions of the first speech act. or rather about its possiblepragmatic consequences. These are expectations about what the agentspeakerwill or can do next. Thus, the hearer may expect that u particular assertionabout needs or wants will be followed by a request. In fact, thia is so oftenthe case that the very use of such an assertion may count as an indirect87request Sentence 3a may be used to make a request in a context in which thesource of cold open window is believed by the speaker to be known to thehearer Clark, 1979, 1983.Relevant to our discussion is the fact that hearers apparently have strategiesfor an effective preanalysis of speech acts and speech act sequences. Suchstrategies are possible because of the general motivational wants, wishes,preferences and goaldirected nature of action and interaction, and hence also ofspeech acts. Also, a hearer likewise knows about possible production strategiesof speakers. A difficult request or an embarrassing accusation may often beintroduced by an assertion ur excuse I am sorry, but ... . Finally, language userswill apply strategies to derive global speech acts from speech act sequences. Thatis, they may know that in a conversation a sequence consisting of greeting,question, assertion, assertion, assertion, request, and greeting may function as aglobal request. A long letter, consisting perhaps only of assertions and requestsWe have your son .... Will you please pay ...., may function as a global threat.As we assumed earlier, a hearer need not hear a whole discourse before knowingor being able to guess what the global pragmatic point is. That is, the initialspeech acts of a text or conversation will he interpreted as possible componentsin a global speech act, which need not be directly expressed in the text. We haveseen that assertions about lack of money and about the need to pay some amountsoon, and questions about the hearers wealth. will together lead a hearer quicklyto the global hypothesis that a request for money is being made. Details of thesemacrostrategies will be discussed in Chapter 6.Both for local and for global pragmatic strategies we should assume the presence, not simply of relevant textual or contextual information, but also of veryrich information which we may summarize as nonverbal. In addition to featuringsuch aurface signals as pitch, intonation, stress, loudness, speed, and similarphonological or phonetic properties, oral discourse will be accompanied by muchnonverhal behaviorfor example, gestures, facial expressions, and position of thebody. This information alone may sometimes provide the hearer with soundhypotheses about the wants and opinions of the speaker, and may thereforeconstitute rather powerful aignals for the interpretation of threats, accusations,compliments, or congratulations. With the pragmatic strategies we are, so tospeak, on the boundary between mhat we may call the contextual strategies onthe one hand and the textual ones an the other. Thus, contextual strategies makesystematic searches among cultural, social, and interactional information relevantto the discourse and the communicative situation and their understanding. Thissearch, we assumed, is hierarchical Wider scope information limits the searchfor more particular information at a lower level. Within a given culture andsociety, we already may know that certain interactions and certain speech actswill not occur, and within a given social situation we know that certain speechacts or discourse, types are rare, or are typical. It is under the control of thesecontextual strategies that the textual strategies operate. We have seen that thestrategic understanding of speech acts already involves several kinds of textualinformation. We will now survey some specifically textual strategies, that is, thestrategies used for semantic comprehension.883.6.5. Semantic StrategiesCrucial in a model of discourse comprehension are the semantic strategiesThey establish what a discourse means and what a discourse is about, that is, itsintensions and its extensions or reference. Although in general a discourse is hrduced only within a pragmatic and social context in which it may have variousfunctions as a speech act or interaction type, the semantic strategies yield thenecessary informational content for these social functions. Similarly, surfacestructure strategies do not have a goal in themselves, but are geared towardestablish a representation of these semantic contents and pragmatic or socialfunctions. In other words, syntactic strategies for sentence analysis aresubservient to semantic strategies for sentence understanding, and these in turnare subservient to semanr strategies of discourse understanding, on the one hand,and to the pragmatic strategies mentioned earlier, on the other. We see again apicture of hierarchical ordering for strategic discourse comprehension. This is asit should be. Strategies pertain to overt or mental action and hence involve goalsand their effective realization. I discourse comprehension we will assume thatthis goal consists in a fast, correct, and adequate understanding of the discourse,that is, the construction of a textu, representation in episodic memory, and, ofcourse, the establishment of links between a textual representation and otherepisodic memories among which are other textual representations.However, semantic understanding of a discourse involves rather differcrkinds of tasks, and each of these requires its appropriate strategies. We madedistinction earlier between intensional and extensional understanding. Althoughthis distinction comes from philosophy and logic, it also has its use in linguisticsan cognitive discourseprocessing models. That is, a language user wants toknow not only what an utterance means, but also what it refers to, what it isabout, or what describes. This may be some state of affairs, a situation, anepisode, a series of events or actions, as well as the things and personsparticipating therein, and their properties. As soon as these events, actions, etc.are not merely conceptual or abstract, but realized in some possible world, wewill speak of facts. Roughly, then we assume that clauses or sentences refer tofacts of some possible world, and discourse to specific collections of such facts,such as episodes.These units out in the world, such as things, persons, actions, events, orfact, are relevant for a cognitive model only if they are represented in memory.Epistemologically speaking, this means that cognition is constitutive for suchworld properties An object, a person, an action, an event, or a fact does existas such only in some biophysical way, but as units they are seen, distinguished,understood, and talked about only through their permanent or more episodicrepresentation as concepts in memory. In the next chapter we will discuss thisissue in more detail. We will assume here that although meanings andreferents in a cognitive model are both of a conceptual nature, we stillmay make a distinction between a meaning represcr.tation, which istied to language, and a representation of a fragment of the world Thusa distinction may be made between the meaning of the phrase the boy,89referring to John, and our conceptual representation of that person John, whichinvolves much more than the concept of boy. Similarly, we may not be able toassign a specific meaning to the article the in that phrase but merely a function,namely, that the person referred to John is already known to the hearer.Against this theoretical background we shall now describe some semanticstrategies. According to the linguistic and cognitive theories of discourse, itmakes sense to distinguish two sets of related strategies, local and global ones.The local strategies establish the meanings of clauses and sentences and themeanings and functions of relations between sentences. The global strategiesdetermine the global meanings of fragments of the discourse or of the discourseas a whole. These two kinds of strategy must, of course, interact In order toknow what a discourse is about globally, we usually need at least someinformation from the local sentence level conversely, in order to know theprecise meaning and function of individual sentences and their mutualconnections, we must have an idea about the global meaning or theme of adiscourse. This is not only true for meaning but also for reference.Beginning with global strategies, we must first take into account the fact thatinformation about the overall theme of the discourse does not merely comebottom up from local meanings of words and sentences. We often make a guessabout the theme of a discourse on the basis of inferences from specificsociocultural and interactional situations. In class, in a business meeting, at thebreakfast table, or in parliament, as well as in a newspaper or a psychologytextbook, there are a limited number of discourse types and pragmatic contexts,and hence a limited number of possible themes. According to the hierarchyhypothesis, a language user will always first make guesses or at least haveimplicit expectations about these possible themes. That is, he or she has arepresentation of a class of possible themes. Then. these themes may beexplicitly signaled to the hearer in many ways, by announcements, agendas,invitations, prefaces, titles, headings, etc. In Chapter 6 we will discuss thesemacrostrategy signals of the communicative situation. Again, this also holds forreference. If some objects, persons, events, actions, or episodes arc available tothe language users directly or via pictures, film, etc., then they may becognitively represented, which may lead to the inference of an actual theme. Thisis what the discourse is globally about.The other information that makes the inference of global meanings and reference possible must come from the discourse itself. This information is basicallyalso semantic It is the meaning of words, sentences, and sequences that enablesthe inference of macrostructures. Of course, as for all the inference strategiesdiscussed so far, we also need other cognitive information from worldknowledge, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, interests, or goals of the hearer or of thespeaker, as believed to exist by the hearer.Contrary to the macrorules postulated in earlier cognitive models van Dijk,1977a, 1980b Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978, the macrostrategies operate on partialsemantic information. Instead of a full sequence of relevant information fromsentences, even one or a few sentences or their underlying propositions may be90enough to derive a macrostructure. There are many cues that guide this verycrucial set of macrostrategies titles and subtitles, summaries, leads, thematicsentences, introductions, and announcements in the text itself, and so on. Thesemay bc signaled in written text by specific position, typeface, and type size, inoral discourse by pauses, stress, and intonation. One strategy, for instance, saysthat if a discourse gives information about the various conditions of some actionor event. we may assume that the discourse fragment as a whole will be aboutthat action ur event.Local discourse strategies consist, in part, of the sentence comprehensionstrategies discussed earlier in this chapter. In our next chapter we will try toshow that sentence comprehension involves the strategic construction ofpropositions, that is, cognitive representations of facts as discussed earlier.Propositions have a fixed schema, depending on the kind of dominant predicateinvolved, featuring the various participants and their modifiers. Propositionsorganize lower level conceptual information, that is, the atomic propositions thatunderlie meaningful words and phrases.For a discourse model we are particularly interested in the ways in whichsentences or propositions are related. We have assumed before that one of thefundamental semantic properties of discourse is that it is coherent. The themes ormacrostructures discussed earlier define the global coherence of the discourse.Locally, coherence must be established by the interpretation of relations betweensentences, the socalled connection relations. Theoretically we know that theserelations involve conditional relations between propositions, denotingconditional relations between facts in some possible world. This means that if ahearer assurnes that the discourse refers to an understandable fragment of theworld, for instance, all episode consisting of some events and actions, then thatpart of the discourse will be understood as coherent in principle. However, this isnot enough. Discourse not only must satisfy the various connection conditions,but must also exhibit a number of complex correspondence rules. That is, wemay not describe some episode by arbitrarily joining together the sentencesdescribing aspects of such an episode. We need, first of all, some principles ofordering. These may involve, for instance, thc rule that first events arerepresented first, unless a different order of the events is marked e.g., withBefore ... , Earlier, ..., or that more general, more encompassing events,objects, or places come before their component objects or properties. Then, wehave various types of selection principles. Neither semantically norpragmatically is it necessary to describe all properties of some event or object.Hence, a discourse will limit itself to partial descriptions, which may vary indegree of completeness and level of abstraction. It follows that the strategies of adiscourse understander not only involve correctly establishing the relationshipbetween the sentences as they reflect relationships in our knowledge of reality,but also involve interpreting the selection and ordering evidenced in thediscourse.Finally, it goes without saying that at the local level as at the global level, alanguage understander will establish coherence relationships as effectively and henceas quickly as possible. It is therefore unlikely that he or she will wait with the91interpretation of the relation between Si and Si1 until the full sentence Si1 hasbeen interpreted. It is plausible that the hearer will try to establish links with Siafter interpreting the first phrases of Si1, for example, the subject or topic.Experimental results reviewed in Chapter 2 support these speculations. In fact thewellknown phenomenon of topiccomment articulation is precisely the linguisticmanifestation of this strategy It allows the reader to rapidly know which of thepreviouslv mentioned participants is relevant again in the construction of thefollowing proposition. Inferring coherence on the basis of shared arguments amongpropositions is a powerful strategy for quickly establishing a coherence relationbetween sentences Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978. Similarly, explicit connectives willbe the most obvious signals of such relationships, this time not between details ofpropositions their participants but between the propositions as wholes. Alsocrucial at this local level of discourse comprehension is the role of knowledge andbeliefs about possible, probable, or likely relations between the facts in the world.Given a sentence referring to some fact, the hearer may already have wellfounded expectations about the possible facts that may be mentioned lateralthough, naturally not about all facts, because then the discourse would bepragmatically trivial. These expectations and their role in the strategicestablishment of local coherence will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.3.6.6. Schematic StrategiesWhereas the strategies for text processing mentioned in the preceding subsection have their counterparts in rules of grammar, we must assume that discoursealso exhibits other kinds of conventionalized structures. Well known, forinstance, are the typical schematic structures of narrative. Although in the recentdebate about the psychological reality of such structures, it has sometimes beenmaintained that they do not exist or do not influence discourse processing, or thatthey can be explained in terms of action, we assume that such schematicstructures not only are relevant in an abstract discourse theory, but also shouldfeature in a cognitive model. Thia means that members of a given culture knowfor several discourse types what their global organization is In a story we knowthat a narrative typically begins with a category like setting, after which we mayexpect a complication. Such schematic categories organize the macrostructuralcontent of a discourse. They are, so to speak, the macrosyntax for the globalmeaning. Similarly, we know that argumentative discourse may consist ofpremises and a conclusion, and that a scientific report is traditionally analyzed interms of conventionalized categories. These stereotypical categories maysometimes have their basis in properties of communicative interaction, but theyhave become conventionalized and therefore exhibit their own structuralfeatures. For some very specialized types of discourse, comprehension strategiesare unfamiliar to many readers and must be taught explicitly, for example, forunderstanding forms and public documents Holland  Redish, 1982 or legaldiscourse papers Charrow, 1981 Radtke, 1981 Danet, 1980, 1983.For a theory of discourse strategies such schematic structures are rather impor92tant. That is, when we begin to read a discourse, we try to establish as soon aspossible what the initial theme or macrostructure is. However, we also want toestablish as soon as possible the global function of that section and its themewithin the discourse as a whole. That is, we make a hypothesis about theschematic or superstructural category involved e.g., introduction, or preface, ora lead in a newspaper. As usual, the strategy may make use of a number ofsurface structure indicatorsannouncements, subtitles, indications about the typeof discourse. source of the discourse newspaper, book of stories, scientificjournal, and so on.The strategies may run both top down and bottom up Guessing the functionot a macroproposition would be bottom up, whereas partial knowledge of the discourse type and hence of the schema would be top down.Schematic structures often occur in a transformed way. That is, the actualdiscourse may somehow be different from the canonical structure. A reader willthen not be able to work top down and simply apply the schema, but will have todetermine from the global content of the relevant part of the text what the globalschematic function is. In that case, however, there is an expectation that a categorythat normally comes first, for instance the setting in a story, will come later.Another problem is that not all discourse types have a conventionalizedsuperstructural schema. Thus, an advertisement in a magazine can have nearlyany form, so that schematic interpretation is either difficult or irrelevant here.This point will depend on further empirical research into schematic structures ofdiscourse.Note finally that schematic structures need not be confined to the macrolevel.nor are they solely concerned with semantic structures. A rhyme schema in apoem. for instance, has the same theoretical nature, but organizes prosodic,phonological. and graphical structures. In those cases where the rhyme schemahas become conventionalized, for example, in a sonnet, it permits topdownprocessing. Metrical structures, as they have been studied in poetics andrhetorics, are another example of nonsemantic schemata, though they tend topertain to the discourse as a whole. Once again, their role in processing shouldnot be underestimated. Their stereotypical or conventionalized nature encouragestopdown processing and makes it easier to apply comprehension strategies,thereby facilitating semantic comprehension.3.6.7. Stylistic and Rhetorical StrategiesThe very notion of language and discourse strategy seems to be closely related tothe object of study for stylistics and rhetoric. In addition to the correct manner olspeaking regulated by the grammar, rhetoric in classical times was the art thatprescribed the most effective way of public speaking. This effectiveness had severalimplications. The central aspect was, of course, persuasion A speaker, for instance,in parliament or in court, should try to convince the public or the judge that he hada good case so that they would judge positively, believe him, and finally accepthis arguments. This ultimate goal had to be brought about by specified good93ways of speaking, for which rhetorics formulated rules and strategies Lausberg.1960 Corbett, 1971. Most of these apply to the local organization of discourse,for example, at the morphophonological, syntactic, and semantic levels. It is herewhere such prosodic features as rhyme, alliteration, repetition, and figures ofspeech based on contrast, metaphor, or irony were formulated. Some of the,edevices are currently studied in the field of stylistics.For our discussion it is important to stress that in principle any kind of diacourse, and especially the more persuasive types, exhibit various kinds ofrhetorical structures. Even everyday conversation has many of them. This meansthat understanding discourse implies at least implicit recognition of rhetoricaldevices. A processing model for comprehension, therefore, will have to specifywhat strategies a language user applies to recognize these structures and to relatethem somehow to the semantic representation. In many cases this may not beconscious, and most naive language users will not be able to recognize arhetorical device as such, but we may assume that their postulated effectivenesspresupposes interaction with the semantic and pragmatic representation of thediscourse. Although surface structures and detailed semantic structures areusually not well remembered, or are remembered only occasionally in specificsituations, the rhetorical structures are somewhat of an exception. Because theyembody a special or original way of saying things, they may contribute to abetter organization of the semantic representation of the discourse and hence tobetter recall and, therefore, to a better interactional effect. Related to thisfunction would be the esthetic effect of the discourse Somebody has saidsomething very well. This means that a textual representation is connected withan evaluation, which again is an assignment of additional structure that enable,better retrieval of the information. Literature is a prototypical case in thisrespect. and literary passages are in general read specifically for evaluation andtherefore are perhaps easier to recall or recognize Dillon, 1978 Groeben,1982. For semantic rhetorical structures such as metaphor, metonymia, orirony we may assume additional processing in order to be able to understandalso their literal meaning, although the precise way in which people understandmetaphors is still poorly understood but see Glucksberg, Gildea,  Bookin,1982. It appears, however, that additional semantic structure is assigned at thelocal level to the discourse, which also makes the passage more accessible forretrieval. In particular, the use of devices that relate the semanticrepresentation to personal experiences or to episodically or emotionallyrelevant information vividness in a description, for instance assign additionalstructural relations in episodic memory, so that the discourse can be betterrecalled Keenan, MacWhinney,  Mayhew, 1977. We can only guess aboutthe precise strategic processes involved in the decoding, interpretation, andfurther semantic or episodic integration of such rhetorical structures. But aswith schematic structures we should assume that they play an important role inefficiently establishing the semantic representation. In Chapter 7 we will see,for instance, that rhetorical devices may be used to signal the macrostructuresof a text. They may point to what is important or specifically relevant. Thus, a94metaphor or the elaboration of a thematic contrast may highlight the theme thatis most important for the speaker, and in this way the hearer or reader has anadditional means of detecting such important parts of the discourse Carbonell,1981.Under the style of a discourse we understand the specific variation of thegrammatical and other schematic or rhetorical rules or devices that characterizesthat discourse, speaker, discourse type, or context. Here we typically areconcerned with the use of rules Labov, 1972a, 1972b Enkvist, 1973 Sandell,1977 Scherer  Giles, 1979. Such a specific use may indicate some propertiesof the actual situation, such as the personal situation of the speaker angry,happy in the social context or the communicative interaction. In principle,stylistic variation presupposes some form of underlying identity or similarityWe can say the same thing in different ways. This may mean the same globaltheme, the same semantic representation at the local level, or the same local orglobal speech act. Variation in surfacu structure, given this semantic orpragmatic identity, may then be used to indicate thL various contextual aspectswhich consciously or unconsciously may be used to communicate to the readeror hearer more than just the contentfor example, to, communicate that we areangry, that we are polite, informal, confidential, or thai we know what socialcontext e.g., school or street we are talking in. Hence, stylistic variation isextremely important for the interactional interpretation of the discourse, becauseit may signal intentions, purposes, strategy, attitudes, and the relationship of thespeaker to the hearer. The variation is usually defined in terms ot phonologicalfree variation, such as pronunciation, lexical choice from different registers,and syntactic variation length, complexity.The strategic effects of stylistic variation and specific choice are undoubtedlyhighly complex. Whereas differences in syntactic complexity will, as is wellknown in reading research, affect ease of decoding and hence of semanticunderstanding, and the choice of difficult words will require more memorysearch as well, the other stylistic choices should rather be taken as indications ofthe contextual information conveyed, whether intentionally or not. A choice ofpolite words will categorize the discourse and hence the speech act and thespeaker as now being polite, which has consequences on the interaction ofspeaker and hearer The hearer may be more willing to change his or hercognitive set, believe the speaker, or perform the actions requested. Such astylistically indicated contextual interactional strategy presupposes that alanguage user knows what kind of stylistic variation is polite, formal, friendly.,familiar, aggressive, or defensive. If we assume that language users not onlyhave world knowledge but also, closely associated, language knowledge, wewould assume that each lexical expression is paired with its stylistic value, as isindeed the case in dictionaries. But this wouldjust be the word level and would saylittle about larger discourse structures. Of course, a discourse may be interpretedstrategically as being polite on the basis of the use of polite words, but it maycontain themes that would not fit such an interpretation at all. Hence, althoughstylistic choice is an indication about the interactional relationship or attitude ofthe speaker toward the hearer, the rest of the semantic and pragmatic information95should be consistent with these surface structure signals in order for the hearer orreader to construe a correct interpretation.From this intuitive description of the possible strategic uses of stylisticfeatures of a discourse it again appears that strategic discourse comprehension isan extremely complex process, involving the processing of a large amount ofdata. From the text itself we need an account of local and global semantic andpragmatic strategies, an account of schematic categories, and finally an accountof stylistic alld rhetorical strategies which pertain to the various other levels ofthe discourse. At the same time, the language user must strategically decodevarious types of contexts, in hierarchical order, and match this analysis with theappropriate analysis of the discourse itself. Only then can partial and tentativehypotheses be made about the meaning or function of a sentence, a sequence ofsentences, or the discourse as a whole. Previous discourse models have seriouslyunderestimated the complexity af this job.3.7. THE REPRESENTATION OF STRATEGIESWe have tried in this chapter to present a consistent and comprehensive viewkit discourse processing. In succeeding chapters we shall elaborate this view inmuch more detail. It is, however, a long way from the broad, general, theoreticaloutline we have given here to a worked out informationprocessing model ofcomprehension. We shall show how such models can be created for variousaspects of dicourse comprehensionwith certain simplifying assumptions and bysacrificing some of the comprehensiveness of the theory as discussed here. Thefirst step toward the formulation of such specific models is to find a suitablerepresentation system for strategies.Fortunately, we can turn to other areas and other fields where formalismshave been developed which are highly appropriate for our problems. We suggestthmt strategic comprehension processes can best be modeled as productionsystems. Production systems Newell  Simon, 1972 are, in general, deductiveor inductive inference systems that use patterns or rules to guide decision makingWaterman  HayesRoth, 1978. The rules are antecedentconsequent pairs.The antecedent of the rule is matched to some input condition the data, and thematch results in the execution of some consequent action a modification of thedata. As Newell and Simon point out, the term production derives originallyfrom symbolic logic, but basically the same idea was used in Markov processes,the rewrite rules of transformational grammar, and some early programminglanguages such as SNOBOL.The components of a production system are a data base and a set of productionrules which match the data base. If only a single production matches the data, thecorresponding action is executed. Usually the world is not so simple, however, andproductions require a control system. The task of this system is to select or activaterelevant productions and data elements, filtering out an often huge number of96irrelevant things. A production system also has to have some conflict resolutionprocedure in the event that, in spite of this selection, the response set is stillambiguous or multiple. Various control structures have been used. For example,one can consider productions as competing actors or as cooperative beings. Ineither case, their interaction must be scheduled carefully. Schemes for doing sorange from the obvious and simple to the exotic Petrinet nodes in manycases, knowledge sources and frames provide the desired guidance for a detaileddiscuasion see the papers in Waterman and HayesRoth, 1978.Patterndirected inference systems range from the supersimple to the highlycomplex with the computing power of a Turing machine, and it is our task toexplore briefly whether the strategic model of discourse comprehensionproposed here can be modeled via a production system, and what such a systemwould be like.The stimulusresponse theory of behavioristic psychology was an early, extremely simple, form of a production system. It was much too tightly constrainedby the requirement that both the antecedents and the consequents of the rules hadto he observable. The TOTE hierarchy of Miller, Galanter, and Pribram 1960,as well as the earliest generation of production systems in cognitive psychologyNewell, 1972 Klahr, 1973, were still very tightly constrained, although inother ways. In recent years, however, production systems of astonishingcomplexity have been constructed. In natural language processing we mentionthe English language interpreter ELI developed by Riesbeck 1978 and used asa frontend parser for the storyunderstanding programs SAM and PAM. Alsofor story understanding, Simmons 1978 developed a production system totransform English text into a propositional representation, which is then analyzedinto a network of causal relationships. In these programs we already encounterthe central problem of all such systems how to deal with the large number ofproductions that are necessary m perform any reasonably interesting task. Evenif computation time increases onlv linearly with the number of productions thathave to be checked against the data. systems become unwieldly very quickly andthe danger of a computational explosion is never far off. Anderson 1976 in hisproduction system simulation of human memory uses special techniques to limitthe number of data elements and rules that are considered at any time via aspreading activation network. In what is todav perhaps the most complex use ofproduction systems, knowledge engineering Feigenbaum, 1977, the selection ofactive rules is guided by knowledge sources, hence the intelligent character ofthese systems. In any case, production systems are used successfully today fortasks that in their complexity rival discourse understanding. Are they alsosuitable for our taskFrom the discussion earlier in this chapter we can derive some crucial propertiesof strategies which an adequate representation must reflect Strategies are flexibleand operate on many different kinds of input they must be able to function withincomplete, partial input they must operate in parallel on several different levelsof analysis, the results on one level affecting the processes on the other they arefundamentally nondeterministic and often produce a large number of alternative97outcomes varying in plausibility. Although these requirements produce demandson production systems that are not easily met, it appears that work currentlyprogressing in artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology is at least well onthe way toward a solution. No other formalism is nearly as completely workedout as production systems to meet the requirements of strategies.Part of the flexibility requirement of strategies is that they must work topdown as well as from the bottom up. Normally, production systems areantecedent driven The left side of the production rule, the antecedent, is matchedto some data element, producing some kind of result. Productions can also workbackward, however Matches can be performed on the consequent, producing anantecedent. A sequence of such backward chaining steps may then generate thegiven input situation, much as one proves a mathematical theorem by workingbackward. Strategies usually must work with incomplete, partial information.The need for partial matching is widely appreciated among designers ofproduction systems Joshi, 1978 HayesRoth, 1978, though definitive solutionsfor all the problems are not yet at hand. Joshi observes that except for logicalsystems and a few wellstructured domains, all inferences are made in a contextof incomplete information. If we have a rule ABC  X, but are given only A, anumber of problems arise. First of all, A may be a component of other rules, too,and hence an ambiguous response set may be generated. In Joshis productionsystem, disambiguation is achieved in two ways. First, there is a metarule thatselects that rule that differs in the fewest number of elements from the completeinput pattern. Second, there is an interesting weighting rule, in which thecomponents actually matched contribute positively though in different amountsand elements not matched contribute negatively to the weight of a production.Other schemes are developed to deal with those cases where an input in order tobe matched completely requires matching to the antecedents of more than oneproduction.Weights, whether for validity, reliability, or some sort of proximity measurein semantic space, can readily be incorporated into production systems. Thus,strategies retain their probabilistic character.Strategic systems are probably best suited to deal with the everthreatening ruinof production systemsthe computational explosion. For efficient computation, boththe strategies and the data have to be divided into a small set of active elements and alarge set of quiescent ones. The psychology of memory provides some guidelines totell us what data are active at any time in discourse comprehension. We shall returnto that question in detail in Chapter 10 of this book. The question of how knowledgeis used, that is, which production strategies are active at any time, will be taken upin Chapter 9. Here it is sufficient to indicate that the solutions which computerscientists have suggested for this problem can readily be applied to strategicsystems as defined here. One of the principles is to use global selective filters toprevent irrelevant productions from being compared to condition patterns e.g.,McDermott, Newell,  Moore, 1978 we have described the funneling functionof higher order cultural and social strategies in similar terms. Another principlethat has been proposed in this connection is that higher order representa98tions should be preferred to lower level ones HayesRoth, 1978 we havealready discussed this issue with respect to strategies and shall report anexperimental study that is relevant to it in Chapter 9. The efficiency, almostnecessity, of using mulo level representations and multilevel processes isrepeatedly stressed in the literature on production systems e.g., HayesRoth,Watertnan,  Lenat, 1978593 it is, of course, an integral feature of our systemof strategies. The main problem for production systems is complexity reductionstrategies are designed for that purpose.Most major problems, discourse comprehension certainly included, cannot besolved by a set of predefined rules. Instead, they require a flexible, dynamic,multilevel system, that is, a strategic one. In the next chapters we shall describethe strategies that are used at the various levels of discourse processing, startingwith the construction of a propositional representation for a text, and ending withits macrostructure. In Chapter 9 we shall then return to questions of knowledgeuse which were touched upon in this section.3.8. A SAMPLE ANALYSIS THE NESWEEK TEXT3.8.1. General Introduction to the Analysis of This TextIn this chapter and in the following chapters we will illustrate our argument,and proposals with an analysis of the processes involved in the comprehension ofa specific text. For this purpose we have chosen a text Guatemala No Choicesfrom Nesweek March 1, 1982, p. 16, which is reprinted on the front endpapersof this volume. This text exhibits most of the properties involved in natural,evervday discourse understanding, in all its complexity of textual, cognitive, andcontextual relationships. In the appropriate chapters we will analyze the relevantstrurtures of this text as assigned by an imaginary reader. We will handsimulatetha analyses of the various units and levels, the strategic processes taking placeduring this analysis, and the representation of the text in episodic memory. Thismeans that we have to make explicit not only the various structural properties ofthe text itself, but also the knowledge of the reader about the kind of situationand events denoted by the text and about the communicative context in which thetext is understood. It goes without saying that in making this knowledge explicitwe try to construct an ideal, average, reader, but we will also specify howdifferent interpretations can result from different strategies and different previousknowledge or other presupposed cognitive information. Also, it is obvious thatour analysis cannot possibly be complete. For each complex unit or level ofanalysis we will merely give a partial description of structures and processes,with a general emphasis on the strategies used in comprehension.We have chosen this text as an example not only in order to enhance theecological validity of our model, but also to deviate from the tradition of usingsimple stories or simple descriptive paragraphs in discourse comprehension model99ing. Our sample text is characteristic in the process of forming and changingpolitical knowledge about the world, a process all of us are engaged in whenusing media messages. For such texts, readers will also need further cognitiveinformation, such as ideologies, attitudes, and opinions, intricately linked to theprocess of comprehension Carbonell, 1978.3.8.2. An Overview of the StrategiesInvolved in ComprehensionIn this chapter our analysis will be limited to a description of the variouskinds of strategies involved in the comprehension of this Nesweek text. In thefollowing chapters we will spell out these strategy types what is important hereis the way in which they interact. Each strategy may variously call on others toobtain the necessary information.Sociocultural strategies. The reader of this text participates in a communication process which is embedded in a larger sociocultural context. For ourexample this means that we presuppose that a reader fonns the general goal ofacquiring relevant information about the world, including information aboutpolitical events. The general motivation for this intermittent activity ofinformation seeking may just be interest, or, more specifically, the use of theinformation in informal everyday conversation, the use of the information inspecific social positions, or the use of the information in the process of makingpolitical decisions. This general goal may be enacted in different, strategicallyrelevant ways. A person may watch, occasionally or regularly, the news ontelevision, andor read the newspapers, andor read a weekly, andor listen to theradio, andor read political studies, andor participate in everyday conversationabout news events. The specific ways in which the goal is enacted will dependon a number of factors, such as the availability of the various media, the amountof information needed, the overall use of the information, and so on. In our case,then, we assume that it is a strategy of this person to read part of the weeklies,thereby possibly compensating for the lack of news or background informationin the other media or types of communication. Input to this strategy may be suchinformation as the readers socioeconomic position, cultural group, andspecialized political interests. For instance, our reader may be middle class,interested in international news, especially about Central America and itsrelations with the foreign policy of the United States government, and might usethis information in a process of political decision making concerning a stancetoward the actions of the United States in Central America.Communicative strategies. Within this sociocultural context a person mayengage in specific communicative acts, such a reading a weekly. Such an act will,under the scope of the more general goal of seeking political information, establish a specific goal based on more specific motivational and decisionmaking processes. This goal in our case would be something like Read this weeks Nesweek,a communicative action which is consequent upon buying the weekly or receivinga copy on subscription. Next, the communicative strategy may be spec100ified. For instance, the reader may be interested in reading any news, or justforeign news, or just specific features, or just news about Central America ornews about Guatemala. Obviously, the consequences of these strategies will bedifferent. If there is no specific goal, such as I want to know the latest newsabout Guatemala, then our text will be read with a different cognitive set thanwhen the reader does have such a specific interest. Let us assume for the momentthat our reader does not have this kind of more specific goal, but just reads theweekly to obtain varied political information. We will also assume that ourreader is a middleclass Amenrican, with an average knowledge, mostly obtainedvia the media, about political affairs in general and the international politicalsituation in particular, say a student of psychology. Such a reader would not havespecific interests for special information, as would a political activist, apolitician, or a business person having business contacts with Guatemala. Havinggone through the acts involved in realizing thc overall strategy of seekingpolitical information from the media, having selected a specific weekly, andhaving started to read through, in any order, this issue of Nesweek, a reader willthen come to this specific page. At this point, even beforc reading the title of thereport, which act may in itself result in the decision to read of skip this article,the reader may have the following cognitive setup for the actual understandingprocess involved in reading this text1. General communicative goalsl. l. Seeking political information1.2. Reading a weekly1.3. Reading Nesweek1.4. Reading all domestic and foreign political articles2. Activated knowledge sample2.1. General political knowledge, about American foreign policy, forexample, United States aids anticommunist regime in Central America2.2. Political knowledge can be obtained from the media2.3. Weeklies summarize the weeks main news items2.4. Nesweek is a weekly3. Activated beliefs, opinions, or attitudes sample3.1. I disagree with the policies of the administration3.2. In particular, I disagree with the policy regarding Central America3.3. I do not like Nesweek in general, but3.4. I think Nesweek gives relatively complete and balanced informatia 3.5.Some articles in New.sweek are also critical of the administrationIn other words, our reader will start reading the article with an alreadycomplex goal and with activated knowledge about political events, opinionsabout the policy ot the United States, and about the political stance or thejournalistic quality of the weekly.General reading strategies. Before actually reading the text of the article, the101reader may follow various overall reading strategies. In the case of our sampletext, these strategies may operate as follows1. Read the headline. Try to establish the global topic of the article. Withinthe framework of activated political information, activate knowledge andopinions about Guatemala and news about Guatemala. Decision interestingor not interesting within the overall goal of seeking political information.2. Estimate the length and reading time available for reading of this article. Ifdecision on Point 1 is positive, and if decision about length and readingtime is positive, read the text.3. If 1 or 2 is negative, see if there are other features of the text that wouldmake reading interesting, for example, the picture within the text, or theauthor of the text at the bottom of the article.4. Start reading the text, and specify the topic of the text as implied by thefirst paragraph, and confirm or disconfirm the earlier decision continuereading or stop reading.Local comprehension strategies. Having decided to read the text, the readerwill start reading the first clauses and the first sentences. From the understandingof the title, and against the background of more general knowledge and opinionsabout political reports the word report is mentioned above the title, the readeralready knows a that the text is about Guatemala and b that in Guatemalathere are no political choices. The reader will therefore have addressed themore specific knowledge about Guatemala e.g., country in Central America,bordering with Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Belize, including thepersonally more variable episodic knowledge, with information about the actualpolitical situation in Guatemala e.g., that it is a country ruled by the military inwhich human rights are grossly disrespected. The provisional macropropositionThere are no political alternatives in Guatemala will be fed into the monitoringControl System, and the relevant information about Guatemala will be activatedas a current situation model in episodic memory. Local information will beprocessed under the overall control of this macroproposition, the episodic model,and the other communicative goals mentioned here.With all this information in mind, and especially on the basis of anassumption about the relevant macroproposition, the reader will now start theanalysis of the first sentence1 Compared with the relative shades of gray in El Salvador, Guatemala is astudy in black and white.At this point several strategies will come into action. Neglecting for the momentthe strategies of graphical analysisletter identificationand morphemic analysis, weassume that a first strategy will establish the meaning of the initial words or phrasescompared, or compared with. The activation and actualization of the meaning ofthis expression also yields information about the grammatical category verband hence about the semantic function of the expression a predicate, which102again provides the functional semantic schema for the clause or sentence. That is,the predicate to compare with requires two arguments, namely, twoindividuals, that are compared, and possibly a third argument specifying thedimension of comparison. This activated propositional schema will thereforegenerate constraint, about the occurrence of these arguments. And, finally, thefirst position of the verb, its mode marking compared, and the absence of afirst position subject or agcnt will constrain the overall syntactic and semanticorganization of the sentence, in which a first clause is subordinate to the second,and hence the first proposition has a function in the second. In other words, thefirst words of the first clause alreadv provide much information about thesemantics of the clause and the whole sentence and provide the necessarystructural and semantic constraints.The next phrase, The relative shades of gray, is more complicated for theunderstanding process. Its literal meaning does not fit into the meaning structureof the previous verb nor with the meaning of the macroproposition or the overallregister of political language and its usual meanings and referents. Thus, eitherdefinite interpretation of this phrase is suspended or a hypothesis is set up aboutthe nonliteral e.g., metaphorical interpretation of this expression. But the latteria possible only if we know what the bearer is of the metaphorical property.and therefore understanding of the next phrase in El Salvador becomesimperative. This phrase both ties in with the general political knowledgeactivated and is related to the more specific knowledge about Guatemalaactivated by the macroproposition expressed by the headline. However, thereader may still be unsure about the precise metaphorical meaning of relativeshades of gray, as no obvious propery of a country is usually rendered with acolor metaphor, except maybe the color metaphor of red for communist. Inother words, full interpretation will have to await further information from thesentence.The next clause does start with a subject in topic position, Guatemala, which atthe same time matches with the subjecttopic of the macroproposition, so that thereis a local manifestation of the meaning of the macroproposition. Moreover, thepropositional schema activated by compared can now be further filled in Thecomparison is between El Salvador and Guatemala, but such that the latter is themain argument in the comparison a property of Guatemala is compared with iproperty of another country. Next follows another metaphorical phrase a study inblack and white. Again, a precise meaning might not yet be available, although thecolor metaphor black and white does have the more conventional meaning ofmarked contrast. As the article is interpreted under the general scope of politicalnews, the metaphor will first be translated into a specific political meaning, suchas political contrasts are marked, which will in turn provide some more meaningto the metaphor in the first clause. But, still, even within the semantic domain ofpolitics the precise meaning of the metaphorical expression may remain vague. Wemay have social, economic, or cultural contrasts. From this example we sec on theone hand that the words and phrases of a sentence may already provide constraintsabout its further meaning, but on the other hand that strategies sometimes do not103yield sufficient information for a final interpretation. For the processing modelthis means that this information, even in its partial analysis, must be kept in theshorttenn memory buffer, and that information from a next sentence is expectedto provide the missing link.Indeed, the next sentence immediately provides this missing link in a firstadverbial noun phrase on the left. This conventionalized spatial metaphor maybe interpreted as providing political informationnamely, information aboutpartiea and groups of a specific political signature, such as liberal, socialistor communist. Such an interpretation is confirmed in the rest of the first clauseof the second sentence, namely, by the phrase extreme MarxistLeninist groups,which fits well with the actualized political information in general and with themore specific knowledge about the political contrasts in Central America. Thephrase on the left, in its topical position, at the same time sets up the expectationalready present in the shortterm memory buffer comparex, ythat groups onthe right will also be mentioned, which is confirmed in the third sentence. Therest ot the paragraph provides the details necessary for the interpretation of themetaphor in tile first sentence Gray is the political middle, and black and whiteis the opposition between the extreme political left and the extreme politicalright. It goes without saying that in order to provide such interpretations, thereader must have detailed political knowledge and in particular must knowsomething about the political spectrum in countries of Central America.Local coherence strartegies. From our description of some of the comprehension strategies operating in the interpretation of the first sentence, we alreadygleaned some properties of the next kind of strategies involved, namely, thoseestablishing relations between clauses and sentences. Whereas the two clauses ofthe first sentence are functionally coherent due to the explicit expression of thefunction of comparison, which is a wellknown functional or rhetorical type oflocal coherence between clauses or sentences, the relation between the first twosentences also has a functional nature The second sentence explains or specifieswhat has been said in metaphorical terms in the first, namely, by giving furtherinformation about the political contrasts in Guatemala. Indeed, the phrase on theleft should be understood as referring to the political situation in Guatemala, notto that in El Salvador, and this interpretation is due to the a topic and subjectfunctions of Guatemala in the previous sentence, b the fact that Guatemalaoccurred in the main clause there, and c the relevance of the discourse referentGuatemala with respect to the macroproposition. The local coherence strategy,therefore, will link the initial phrase on the left with the concept Guatemala inthe previous main proposition, a hypothesis confirmed by the subsequentsentences.The same holds for the strategic interpretation of the third sentence, satisfying theexpectation about a leftright description of the political spectrum generated by thefirst two sentences. At that point, the information from the first sentence may nolonger be present in the shortterm buffer, but only its general implication, namely,that there are marked political contrasts in the situation in Guatemala and that this is104different from El Salvador. This means that the reader will expect that ElSalvador will come up again for explication of the comparison, which indeed isthe case in the relative clause in the fourth sentence.Macrostrategies. Implicitly we already discussed the next type of strategies,namely, the macro strategies, which aim at establishing a topic, gist, or macroproposition for the text as a whole and for the first part of the text in particular.The communicative context already provides constraints on the domain ofpossible overall meanings, in our case politics. Next, the headline of the articlespecifies that the text is a discourse about a specific country the macropredicate,though vague, provides some idea about the political predicament of the situationin that countryThe initial sentences of the text then start out to provide the relevantspecifics. The first thus leads to a macroproposition The situation in Guatemalais compared to that of El Salvador, which dominates the first part of the text.Next, the black and white metaphor, spelled out with the leftright opposition,explains why there are no choices in Guatemala, which therefore confirms themacroproposition. Not only at the level of words, clauses, and sentences, but alsoat the level of macrostructures, a considerable amount of world knowledge mustbe activated in order to derive the relevant macroproposition or to confirm firstguesses as derived from title, communicative setting, and context.Schematic strategies. Although we will in general study schematic strategiesat the global level, our example also exhibits schemata at a more local level,schemata which are often called rhetorical. Thus, making comparisons orspelling out opposition or contrast is a typical rhetorical device, here signaled bymetaphors and the use of phrases such as on the left and on the right in initialpositions of adjacent sentences. That is, such schemata assign specific,functional, structure to semantic elements of these sentences.At the global level, schematic superstructures are supposed to assign anoverall organization to this article. That is, the successive macropropositions,represented by, for example, paragraphs, may have conventional functions, suchas Introduction and Conclusion. In newspaper discourse, these superstructureswill involve such categories as Headlines, Lead, Events, Backgrounds, Context,or Comments van Dijk, 1981b, 1983a,b.Thus, the first paragraph is typically a general summary of the article,presenting the main facts the political contrasts in Guatemala, the consequencesof this contrast i.e., that there is no easy solution, and finally the differencewith El Salvador. The second paragraph then gives historical background,namely, of the relations between Guatemala and the United States, typicallymarked by past tenses. and the consequences of this historical backgroundfor the actual situation. The third paragraph then specifies the actual situationof the relationships between the United States and Guatemala. Next, thefourth paragraph summarizes the actual events, namely the activities of theGuatemalan government to fight the guerrilla by arming itself from varioussources. In fact, this is still a preparatory condition for the main events,namely, the actual fighting and repression going on, mentioned in the next105paragraphs. These events are also presented in a schemalike fashion Adescription of the actions of the government and the army, as well as of deathsquads, is followed by a description of the actions and preparations of theguerrillas. This binary opposition is in fact the macrostructural specification ofthe black and white metaphor given in the beginning. Finally, the last paragraphspecifies a number of conclusions from the situation for the American foreignpolicy toward Guatemala.We see that news reports have a number of recurring, conventionalcategories. such as a summary or lead, historical backgrounds, a series of mainevents, including preparations and consequences, and overall politicalconclusions. On the whole the perspective dominating both the macrostructureand the superstructure is the American one, because the conclusions, marking thepragmatic relevance of the text, pertain to American foreign policy. Note thatthese conventional categories holding for news discourse are not derivable fromthe local or global semantic structure, or from knowledge about the politicalevents or actions described. They are conventional structures of news discourseper se, but of course are linked to the macrostructures and hence to the possiblemeanings of the sentences of a paragraph dominated by a macroproposition.There is nothing in the facts themselves that would make it natural to give asummary first and to give a conclusion last. A semantic mapping would at mostmotivate a historical ordering in the description of the facts, or a causal ordering,going from motivation and goal to the events and their consequences.The strategies used to derive relevant superstructures again combine information from various sources. First, top down, the knowledge about thecommunicative event and hence about the specific type of discourse alreadyspecifies a possible schema. Next, a segmentation into paragraphs will suggestboth a macrostructural and a superstructural organization. Third, themacropropositions themselves will be assigned provisional functions, forexample, that of general summaryas expressed also by the titlefor the firstmacroproposition, expressed by the first paragraph. Fourth, there will be localindicators, such as the change to past tense in the second paragraph, functioningas the historical background category.Knowledge use strategies. Finally, we have a number of strategies handling thecomplex flow of knowledge required in the individual steps of the various strategies.At the relevant points we have mentioned the various knowledge componentsneeded. To establish the communicative situation and set up a global communicativegoal, it was already necessary to draw upon our knowledge about political affairs,news, weeklies, and a specific episodic knowledge about Central America in casethe reading goal is specifically geared toward obtaining information about a certaincountry or region. Obviously, the knowledge involved is vast, resulting from themany sources that have led to our political knowledge of the world. Hence, itseems plausible that a reader will activate, not all knowledge about political affairs,or about international news or about weeklies, but only that knowledge which isimmediately necessary for carrying out the acts necessary to reach the establishedgoal. In other words, we will assume that only a few relevant concepts will beactually activated, but not the full schemata or scripts dominated by them.106Thus, we may expect that the overall control system will be fed with propositionsuch as Newsmeek is a weekly featuring articles with political informationabom the current situation in the world, which will guide the expectations aboutthe discourse genre and the possible contents of the text. At the same time, thisgeneral information will activate the search for a more specific episodic modelfeaturing our previous experiences and our previous reading about some concreteperson, issue, country, or event. As soon as we have read the word Guatemala inthe headline, this search can be more specific, activating our general and episodicknowledge about that country, and, in particular, our more recent memoriesabout the current political situation in that country. Again, the general themepolitical affairs guides this activation, ruling out, for instance, expectationsabout the cultural situation in that country. Hence, knowledge search, whethergeneral or episodic, is guided by the overall goal, by the relevant macrostructuralinformation, and by our episodic knowledge about what kind of information wecan expect at a given time about a certain issue or individual object.This all takes place in a more general preparatory phase of understanding. Atthe local level of comprehension, semantic and episodic knowledge will be addressed in a more specific way, according to the suggestions made in our cursoranalysis. In our case, for instance, we will have to specify further knowledgeabout the two countries being compared, about the actual situation in eachcountry, about the political concepts used to describe this situation, and so on.We assume that onlv that knowledge is activated which is relevant for thederivation of overall and morc local topics, and which is necessary for theinterpretation of individual proposition, and for the establishment of localcoherence relations. Thus, in order to interpret on the left in the second sentence,the access to general political information will be such that information about thepolitical organization of groups or parties is activated, which also allows thegeneration of the expectation after the left is mentioned that the right will bementioned as well.In fact, newspaper discourse uses a number of structural categories that arespecifically meant to organize the use of relevant knowledge. Thus, categoriessuch as historical background, context, or explanation may serve as remindersfor the search in semantic or episodic memory for those readers who have thiskind of background knowledge, whereas, at the same time, for readers who donot have this knowledge, a situation model is specified in which the eventsdescribed are more meaningful.3.8.3. ConclusionFrom the highly informal description of a number of strategies used in thecomprehension of this text we can draw several conclusions. First, there indeedseem to be hierarchical relations among the strategies Some strategies will dominate others. Second, the various global types of information act as topdown processing strategies for the comprehension of local information. Third, informationfor specific strategies, such as the macrostrategies, may come from many sources,107such as textual cues title, contextual information about the weekly, andalready present episodic or semantic memory presuppositions the actualsituation in Guatemala, general knowledge about that country. Fourth, at thelocal level we have forward interpretation strategies, which provide constraintsfor the specific meanings to come, as well as backward interpretation strategies,which specify the meaning of expressions that only were assigned partialinterpretations. And, fifth. knowledge will be called on, in a number ofknowledge use strategies, by all interpretation strategies in such a way that itprovides precisely the relevant information at each point, leaving the moregeneral information at the level of the control schema. At the same time, though,these strategies will link the textual representation with the situation model Themodel will be updated with the new or forgotten information that is expressedby the text. It is this updating strategy that tinallv satisfies the overallcommunicative goal of the readernamely, to obtain new political information.Just as knowledge is activated dependent on the micro or macrolevel ofprocessing, we may assume that knowledge will also be updated in u similarstrategic fashion Main facts, as represented by the macropropositions, will beassigned a specific function in the situation model, whereas possible details mavbe added if they are relevant for further processing e.g., use in conversation.After this introductory discussion of the various kinds of strategies operatingin the interpretation of the Nesweek text, our next chapters will for each strategytype specify in more systematic detail how the strategies actually operate. Wenow have a first idea about their mutual relationships, and we also know thatstrategies are already operating before the text has even been seen, or before thefirst words of the text have been read, and that the outcome of these preparatory,communicative, and contextual strategiesspecifying, among other things, theoverall goal of the reading actheavily determines the choice of the more local orglobal textual strategie, of comprehension.ChapterPropositional Strategies4.1. PROPOSITIONSIn Chapter 2 we saw that many discourse comprehension models involve theassignament of propositions to sentential surface structures. In our own textprocessing model Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978 it was also assumed thatcomprehension consists, among other things, in the formation of a coherentsequence of propositions, a socalled textbase. In this chapter we would like toexamine the first set of strategies involved in the construction of such apropositional textbase. More specifically, we would like to focus our attention onthe formation of complex propositions as they are expressed by the clauses andsentences of a discourse, and as they represent facts in some possible world. Inthe next chapter we will then turn to the strategies that enable a language user toestablish coherence relations between such complex propositions and hencebetween the sentences of the discourse. Before we discuss the variouspropositional strategies, we must, however, briefly assess the nature ofpropositions in a cognitive model. Whereas we have several notions, inphilosophy, logic, and linguistics, of the semantic unit of a proposition, whatremains to be made explicit is how it also functions as a cognitive unit.4.1.1. The Notion of Proposition in Philosophyand LinguisticsBecause the literature on propositions is too vast to even succinctly accountfor here, and because the notion is mostly discussed in relation to the notions of110meaning, reference, and truth value, we shall only mention some of themilestones For a general history of the notion of proposition and related notions,see Kneale  Kneale, 1962, especially pp. 49ff.Although Frege 1962 does not use the notion of proposition itself, hisdistinction between Sinn and Bedeutung, both for words and sentences, has beenfundamental for later discussions of the subject. Whereas Bedeutung for him isthe truth value of a sentence or clause, Sinn would be the nonsubjectivethough Gedanke of the sentence as it determines this truth value. Whiteheadand Russel 1910 use the notion of proposition but do not define it. Strawson19523ff.  usethe term statement instead and emphasizes that a statementwhich is related to truth values and which can be inconsistent with or implied byother statementsis not identical with a sentence nor with the meaning of asentence, because both nuns be used to make identical statements even if they aredifferent, and the converse, depending on context. Reichenbach 19475ff. doesnot make a distinction between proposition, statement, and sentence, but prefersto use the term proposition and takes it as the fundamental unit of language andlogic, with the defining criterion that only propositions can be true or false. Whatis referred to by a proposition or sentence, he calls a situation or state ofaffairs, rejecting Carnaps 194218 identification of situation and proposition.Surprisingly, Reichenbach also rejects as spurious the distinction made by otherlogicians between sentences and propow tions, although admitting that differentsentences, for example, actives and then corresponding passives, may be equisignificant. Carnap  I 94726ff.  appears to be more subtle. Distinguishingbetween extensions and intensions, he identifies, as usual, the extension of asentence with its truth value, and the intension with the proposition expressed byit. Like Frege, he warns that a proposition is not some subjective meaning, nor alinguistic expression a sentence, but an objective conceptual structure whichshould not be identified with a mental occurrence. In that sense, a propositionis as objective as the abstract, general meaning of a word However, confusionarises again when he identities a proposition with something that is actually thecase, exemplified by some individual having some property. As we will see inwhat follows, it is only with Montague  1974 that this confusion was clarifiedA proposition, then, is indeed a conceptual structure, a function. which isexemplified in Carnaps terms by its instantiations, that is, values, in somepossible world. Interesting for our discussion are Carnaps further remarks aboutfacts 194728, made in referring to a paper by Ducasse 1940. Although he doesnot admit facts as a technical term, he identifies a fact with a true propositionswhich is both complete and specific, and of course contingent. We will see brieflyin what follows that this raises the problem of the referential correlate of negatedpropositions. Carnap then takes issue with Russell 1940, in which Russell doesidentify a proposition with the meaning or signification ot a sentence but localize,it in the mind namely, as psychological or physiological occurrences, such asimages, a position which the semipositivist Carnap cannot, of course, acceptpropositions are objective entities, logical types. Quine 1953108, 156 follows a111similar road, although he would prefer to avoid propositions. He agrees withFrege at propositions are neither statements nor values of statements, but at mosttheir eanings. Battling against such things as meanings and intensions in general,uine 1960192ff., 201ff. grudgingly admits propositionsif only to have sumething to be the content of sentences like John believed that ..., but maintains thatis makes sense only for meanings of eternal sentences the truth values ofwhich do not depend on contextual factors such as speaker and time. In Quine197436, he reverts to a rather stern externalist extensional, if not positivistposition, relegating ideas, meanings, and propositions to the realm of vague,useless, or incomprehensible objects.From this brief survey of some of the major philosophers and logicians, itmerges that there is not only disagreement, but also confusion. It has been reemarked e.g., White, 197013ff. that many of the philosophers have made rathervague uses of the term see also Linsky, 19677. Proceeding from the variousproposals, we will maintain in what follows that a proposition is an abstract,theoretical construct, which is used to identify the meaning, or what is expressedby a sentence under specific contextual restrictions speaker, time, place, andwhich is related to truth values. One of the reasons for the multiple confusion isthat propositions have been tied too closely to truth values, however. That is,they have been identified with assertions as speech acts, and with the realizationof assertions in declarative sentences. Although we will touch upon some ofthese issues, we cannot go into the details of an abstract, philosophical or logical,definition of propositions.The use of the notion of proposition in linguistics is more recent than inphilosophy and logic, from which it was adopted widely at the end of the sixtiesalthough linguists will in general continue to speak of semantic representations.As is well known, until the sixties the influence of behaviorism on linguistictheories had precluded a systematic study of meaning. Early structuralism wasmainly concerned with surface structures, and it was the wellknown paper byKatz and Fodor 1963 that tried to provide transformational grammar with asemantic component. Semantic analysis, then, became pervasive in linguistics bythe end of the sixties, particularly within the branch of transformational grammarcalled generative semantics, mainly through the work of scholars such asMcCawley, Lakoff, and, more independently, Fillmore. Again we mention onlysome major approaches.Ogden and Richards 1923 speak of propositions in terms of a completetought, as the object of beliefs, expressed by a sentence, and related to truth andfalsity, in contrast to the meanings of isolated words.Katz and Fodor 1963 account for meanings of sentences in terms ofmeanings of lexical items plus projection rules based on syntacticstructures, but do not discuss propositions as such. Thus, for yearsgrammatical theory continued to speak of semantic interpretations. Readersin semantics, such as Steinberg and Jakobovits 1971, includedphilosophers and logicians, but an independent linguistic definition ofpropositions was not undertaken. This is understandable because, just like112word meanings, sentence meanings in linguistics were hardly ever related toextra linguistic aspects such as truth and falsity, so that the notion of proposition,traditionally linked with truth values, did not become relevant. As soon as anappropriate metalanguage for linguistic semantics was sought in philosophy andlogic, however, the notion of proposition also became current in linguistics, forexample, Katz 197238ff. Lyons 1977 1981119ff.. This is particularly trueof linguistic work in the seventies based directly on logical semantics see, e.g.,Keenan, 1975, and Hintikka, Moravcsik,  Suppes, 1973.In rather rough terms, then, we can say that a proposition is usually taken asthe meaning of a declarative sentence. This meaning has a composite nature Itis a construction of the meanings of the component expressionsthe words orphrase, of the sentence. This construction is the output of the semanticinterpretation rules, and follows the wellknown Fregean principle offunctionality The interpretation ui composite expressions is a function of theinterpretation of its component cxpressions. We will see in what follows that thisprinciple not only holds in philosophy, logic, and linguistics, but essentially alsoin a cognitive model ol interpretation.Whereas a part of philosophy and especially linguistics indeed defines theproposition in terms of the meaning of a sentence, and hence provides aconceptual or intensional semantics, modern logic has initially preferred todefine the proposition in referential, denotational, or extensional terms. That is,propositions, or tha sentences expressing them, are related to truth values. Aproposition, then, is something that can be true or false. For several of the morerecent theories of logics, these truth values have been made relative, for example,with respect to possible worlds, situations, language users, or contexts.Contextual semantics has been advocated mainly following Montague 1974who spoke of formal pragmatics, howeverfor example, by Cresswell 1973.From this perspective, a proposition is usually defined as a set, namely, the set ofpossible worlds in which it is true. In more sophisticated terms, finally, we cansay that a proposition is a function from possible worlds to truth values. Thisdefinition is that of Montague 1974153. Indices for place, time, or othercontextual features may be added as further arguments of the function. Thus, theproposition The boy is ill is something formalized by the notion of a functionwhich for some possible worlds time, place, etc. may be true or false. Units likeThe boy or ill are not proposition, because they cannot, by themselves, be true orfalse.There are many philosophical and logical intricacies which we cannotdiscuss here. For our purposes it is sufficient to know that we haveintensional and extensional approaches to the notion of a propositionandsometimes even combinations of these. To cut short a long discussion, wewill abstractly take a proposition as an intensional unit, corresponding to themeaning of a sentence in linguistic theory, and to the conceptualrepresentation of a sentence in a cognitive model of languagecomprehension. Of course, since we do not hold the view that meanings orconcepts are inherently tied to natural language, propositions defined as sonic113form of a conceptual representation figure more generally in models ofcomprehension, for example, in the comprehension of real or pictorial images orin the comprehension of other semiotic systems. We will limit our discussion,however, to propositions as they are expressed by natural language.4.1.2. The Propositional SchemaAs we have suggested, a proposition is a composite unit. Traditionally, it tiasanalyzed in terms of a predicate and one or more arguments. In extensionalterms, a predicate is understood to refer to properties or relations, and argumentsto individuals, such as things or persons. Since we take a proposition as anintensional or conceptual unit, its component predicate and arguments shouldalso be intensional A predicate is a concept of a property or relation, and anargument a concept of an individual. It would be nice if natural language wouldrespect this distinction in the surface structure of the sentence, that is, in therespective expressions of predicates and arguments. But the situation in thisrespect is confusing We cannot simply say that predicates are expressed byverbs, and arguments by nouns or noun phrases. In the sentence The boy is ill,the noun phrase the boy certainly expresses an argument, andin referentialtermsit is used to denote an individual. for instance John, but at the same time itexpresses the predicate boy and is thus related to a property of John. Logicallyspeaking, therefore, the sentence would he analyzed as at least two atomicpropositionsnamely, boya and is illausually connected by a conjunction into a compound proposition. In that case the expression a, a socalledargument constant, is interpreted as referring to the individual, for instance, John.In other words, what appears to be a single sentence, consisting of one clause,may logically express several atomic propositions. If a proposition, then, isdefined as the meaning of a sentence, we should remember that the propositionmay be composite, that is, itself consist of several other atomic propositions.Only sentences like He is ill, in which the pronoun he has a similar function asthe logical expression a, would express an atomic proposition.Sentences are usually much more complex, and feature not only verbs, verbphrases, nouns, and noun phrases, but also adjectives, adverbs, modalexpressions such as maybe, should, connectives, and so on. Moreover, theyoften consist of several clauses, and not just of one clause. The logical analysisof these various categories of expressions, as well as of the syntactic ormorphological structures such as tense morphemes, has met with extremelydifficult problems which we cannot discuss here. The adequate logicalrepresentation even of atomic propositions has become so complex that at thisstage of development it would not be wise to use logical systems asrepresentation formats for propositions in a cognitive model.Among the many elements of sentences that are still lacking a satisfactorylogical analysis, we, for instance, do not yet know how to account for the socalled114semantic roles or cases characterizing the internal semantic structure of asentence, such as agent, patient, object, instrument, goal, or source. Followingthe seminal paper by Fillmore 1968, many linguists now adopt this kind offunctional semantics, among others, Dik 1978, Anderson 1971, andJackendoff 1972. The cases or semantic functions we use here are merelyillustrative. We will not try to give a formal account of them.Thus, if we would represent the meaning of the sentence John gav the bookto Peter in terms of logical propositions, namely, as Gave to a, b, c  John  a book b  Peter  c, such semantic roles remain implicit in the ordering ofthe arguments. In fact, the same ordering could be used to express many othersemantic role relations. As an ad hoc ad hoc because there is still no explicitformal semantics for such expressions device we could add argument labels,such as agent and patient, to the argument places representing these semanticroles. Similarly, we can devise a schema in which the various semanticcategories of the meaning of a sentence are represented as the nodes in a treelikestructure Figure 4. I Figure 4.1For reasons of simplicity we will henceforth use such a kind of schematicrepresentation for propositions, and call this a propositional schema. Note thatthe proposition represented in Figure 4.1 is composite It consists of severalatomic propositions. The definite article the does not have a separate semanticrepresentation it only expresses that individual b is known or identifiable bythe hearer, and therefore has instead a pragmatic or cognitive function. In otherwords, not all expressions in the surface structure express only semanticproperties of the sentence they may also express pragmatic, stylistic, rhetorical,cognitive, interactional, or social properties.In addition to the categories introduced in the schema of Figure 4.1, we willneed some others in order to do an elementary semantic analysis of English sentences. First, each category may have a subordinated modifier category ormodifier MOD, under which adverbs and adjectives are represented. Second,we need a circumstance kind of category CIRC, under which various time,place, or other complementizers can be represented, as well as the possible worldin which the sentence is interpreted. To represent a sentence like Yesterday, Johninadvertently gave the old book to Peter in the library, we would then havesomething like the schema of Figure 4.2115Figure 4.2This schema, however, is not yet adequateeven for our simplified way of repreiting propositionsbecause not all terminal elements are atomic propositions. Iftadvertently is predicated of the predicate terminal give a, b, c, we need alsoonstant to represent the action of giving. The same holds for the circumstancetegories They have the whole action as their scope, that is, they localize the tionin time and place. Figure 4.2, then, is a simplified representation for the hema inFigure 4.3Figure 4.3The general category action dominating the predicate and argument categories iscessary for various reasons. It determines, for instance, the nature of thepredicate an action verb and the kind of argument categories involved e.g.,agent. Note that the terminal categories of the circumstance category are notpropositional.116They merely localize the complex proposition dominated by the action category.In this respect circumstance acts like modal categories which make propositionsout of propositions. Strictly speaking, the action part of the schema is only apropositional function It is true or false only if we add time and place categoriese.g., as expressed by the verb tense and the location adverb. A propositionalfunction is, so to speak, an incomplete proposition It cannot, as such, be true orfalse. It will typically contain free variables, as in fx or gx, y. If we addquantifiers which bind the variables or substitute constants for the variables, weobtain a proposition. In our example, a full proposition should also containinformation about circunstances, for example, as expressed by tense or adverbs.Although, as we suggested the schema of Figure 4.3 is still far from completefrom a linguistic point of view and far from adequate from the point of view of alogical semantics, we will henceforth use this kind of representation for theabstract structure of propositions. In what follows, we will discuss the cognitiverelevance of this representation.4.1.3. FactsAlthough we now have an approximate analysis of propositions in intensionalterms, we still need some further insight into the extensional aspect ofpropositions. What do propositions, as expressed by clauses or sentences, referto Earlier we mentioned that propositions are usually connected with truthvalues. Such an approach has serious difficulties for the interpretation of naturallanguage sentences First, a truth functional account would have difficultyproviding interpretations for nondeclarative sentences as they are used toperform requests, commands, congratulations, or promises. Such sentences,however, also express propositions. The notion of truth or falsity is linked, itseems, not so much with the meaning, and hence with the propositions, expressedby a sentence, but rather with the pragmatic aspect of declarative sentences, whichare mostly used to perform assertions. They refer to a state of affairs, which is asemantic aspect, and at the same time their use impliesin certain appropriatecontextsthe act of asserting that this state of affairs indeed holds in some possibleworld. Similarly, a request also expresses a proposition, but it is performedpragmatically so that the hearer will act in such a way that some state of affairswill be brought about. Second, whereas predicates are interpreted as things likeproperties or relations, and arguments as individuals, we lack a correspondingpossible world unit which is the referent of a proposition, for example,something that is called a state of affairs. However, since the notion of state ofaffairs seems rather static, and propositions may also denote events, actions, orprocesses, we will use the notion of a fact as the referent of a proposition.The notion of fact has had little attention from philosophers and logicians, letalone from linguists who are seldom interested in extralinguistic entities. We havealready mentioned that Carnap 194728 informally uses the notion, identifying itwith a true proposition plus some further contextual constraints. Prior 1971explicitly examines whether besides propositions we need the notion of fact andconcludes negatively. We use the notion of fact as being equivalent to the German117notion Tatsache, which Wittgenstein 196U distinguished from Sachverhalt. ASachverhalt, indeed, would in our terms be the referent of a propositionailfunction, which we may call a possible fact. It may be expressed linguistically byan incomplete thatclause that John is ill, or Johns being ill. A Tatsache, a fact,is directly tied to the parameters of some specific possible world and situation.Both for linguistic and for logical reasons, the notion of fact also seem, necessaryto provide an adequate formal semantics for, say, nominalizations. Thediscussion about the relevance of facts is rather complex, and we will not try todefend the notion here. Its relevance in the theory of discourse has beenemphasized in van Dijk 1977a.Since our notion of proposition, represented by a schema, is rather differentfrom that in logic or philosophy, we elsewhere have used the term FACT withcapital letters in order to distinguish it from possible world entities, i.e., facts, aswe cognitive correlate, the representation, of facts. In order not to confuse ourreaders, we have here reverted to the classical notion of proposition, thoughadapting it to our needs. In what follows, we will also use the same, abstractnotion of proposition in a cognitive model.Although the notion of fact has no satisfactory philosophical and logicalanalysis, and there may be doubts about its usefulness besides either the notionof a proposition itself or besides the truth values truth and falsity, we think ithas a oumber of intuitive and formal advantages. Some of these will be discussedwhen we consider the cognitive aspects of propositions and facts. Formallyspeaking, facts are fragments of possible worlds. They are, as we see from theintensional analysis of their corresponding propositions Figure 4.3,combinations of some state, process, action, or event, on the one hand, and sometime, place, or other circumstantial parameters, on the other. Hence, the sameevent may become fact in various worlds or situations. In other words, a possibleworld is a set of facts. Again, we will ignore a number of technicalities regardingthe formal account of facts, mentioning just one aspect of interest Negatedsentences do not denote negative facts, but should be taken as pragmatic denialsabout the existence, that is, Actualization, of a fact in some possible world.The notion of fact has some philosophical epistemological and ontologicalintricacies which we can only hint at here. It might be argued, for instance, thatfacts do not exist, as such, in some possible world There is no physical orbioiogmal reality defining a fact, as seems to be the case for properties, relations,or individuals. Facts, in that respect, only exist for human subjects They are, so tospeak, constructions of individuals and their properties and relations. In that case,they would have a cognitive, conceptual, and hence an intensional nature, whichmakes them equivalent with propositions. However, this argument does not hold.First, properties, relations, and individuals also are conventionalized, cognitivelybased, discrete entities assigned to some possible worlds. Just as their existence ispostulated when we abstract from their cognitive projection, we may postulate theexistence of their combination into some fact. So, facts are indeed, epistemologically, constructions based on cognitive operations, but we will in general be able to118abstract from this cognitive basis and just postulate that facts exist out there forall practical purposes. If we witness an accident, we assume that the accidenthappened out there and that it would also exist if we had not seen it. That we callsuch a physical event an accident, thereby distinguishing it from other events, isa conventional, cultural, linguistic, and cognitive aspect of facts. The same,indeed, holds for things like cars, of which we would hardly deny the existenceeither. Here we come to age old philosophical controversies, which we will notfurther explore. For our purposesthat is, for the linguistic and cognitiveinterpretation of discourse facts will be postulated as entities in possible worlds,and taken as the referents of propositions. That is, car accidents exist no less thancars as ontological units.This does not mean that facts are fixed discrete entities of some possible worldTheir projected or construed nature, on the basis of abstract propositions or realcognitive processes of interpretation, allows facts as such to be split intocomponent facts, or the same event to be described or understood at severalhierarchical levels Thus, as part of the event we call an accident, we may have theevent that I drove my car into another car, or that my bumper touched the othercar, etc., or, at a higher level, that I had a traffic problem, or that I ruined myself.This philosophical digression does not imply that facts only exist in what wewould usually call possible worlds. Take, for instance, the socalled propositionalattitudes, such as knowledge, beliefs, opinions, or attitudes about facts. The sentence I think that John gave the hook to Peter of course also denotes a fact, but inthat case it denotes a cognitive fact, that is, a certain state of mind of the speaker.Such states of minds need not be expressed explicitly John is stupid need not referto an external or objective fact, but may be used to express and denote the opinionof the speaker about John. This brings us back to our philosophical query Inprinciple the same fact may always be seen, interpreted, or understood in different ways by different subjects, and hence facts would not be out there anyway.This is correct, but again ignores the kind of epistemological abstraction involvedin the postulation of facts As soon as a state of affairs, event, or action exists foreverybody, that is, if the individual cognitive contexts are no longer relevant, thenfacts do exist externally. In other words, factsrelated to the notion of truthbecomesocial constructs, being open to verifiability criteria, such as observation. Hence,propositional attitude sentences denote subjective facts and other sentences denoteintersubjective or social facts. This leaves open the possibility for individual andcultural variation in the construction of the world, as it should be.Next, a remark about the referential nature of modalized sentences orpropostions. A sentence like Maybe John is ill of course does not denote a fact inthe same way as the sentence John is ill. Rather, the speaker considers thepossibility thar John is ill is true is a fact in our own possible world. Inforrnal terms this simply means that, for the Speaker, there is at least onepossible world imagined situation in which the fact John is ill exists. Thisformulation is slightly different from the usual formal semantic interpretation ofthe modal expression it is possible thatWe have considered the issue of the referential nature of propositions or of theclauses and sentences expressing them, and we have introduced the notion of fact as119their possible world referent. In so doiw, we have followed the direction usuallytaken in philosophy, logic, and linguistics, namely, to assign an interpretation togiven sentences or propositions. That is. we went from words to worlds, as inusual for semantic interpretation rules. There is little explicit theorizing,however, about the reverse aspect of this relationship How do we express somegiven fragment of reality in language, that is, how do we go from worlds towords Although in abstract terms there may hardly be anything relevant to say,it is obvious that a cognitive model of discourse processing will also have toaccount for this aspect. Instead of an interpretational semantics, as we may callall those types of semantics that assign meanings and referents including truthvalues to expressions, we now encounter the necessity of devising arepresentational semantics. Given some individuals, properties, or relations asthey combine into facts, we want to know how these facts are semanticallyrepresented, that is, how propositions are formed and how propositions areexpressed in natural language discourse. Of course, in some sense this is again aninterpretation problem, but now it is not words but worlds which are interpreted.This aspect is especially crucial for an adequate production model of discourse,to which we will turn in Chapter 8, for in order to know how discourse isproduced, we must know how propositions are formed. In the remarks aboutcognitive processing of propositions in what follows we will therefore also havelook at the role that propositional schemata play in the interpretation of theworld, hat is, in the identification or construction of facts. Specifically, we willpay attention to the problem of how collections of facts become represented incollections propositions.We now have the theoretical machinery to attack a number of issues relatedto the comprehension of sentences in discourse. We know that sentences expresspropositions, and that propositions represent facts in some possible world. Bothpropositions and facts may be composite, in the sense that they may consist ofother propositions and facts. Hence, we should postulate atomic propositions andtherefore also atomic facts as their referents. Also, we have seen that aproposition can be represented with a propositional schema, featuring apredicate, a number of arguments with appropriate functions, and variouscircumstances. However, propositions and hence, facts do not come aloneThey are organized in ordered sequences and these constructions have variableexpressions in the sentences of the discourse. It is this construction problemwhich we will analyze, both abstractly and cognitively, in the rest of this chapter.4.2. COMPLEX PROPOSITIONSWe have argued that most sentences of natural language express compositepropositions. In logical terms this means that the propositions are compounds,consisting of a number of atomic propositions. These compounds are defined andsemantically interpreted in terms of connectives, such as conjunction, disjunction,or conditionals of various sorts. In logical formulas the component propositions are120then of the same level The compound is a coordinated structure. In naturallanguage sentences this may be different. We have both coordinated andsubordinated structures One clause may either have the same function as anotherclause, as in coordinated sentences, or it may have a function within the otherclause, for example, as a noun phrase in the subordinate clause of a complexsentence. In logical terms this would mean that one proposition is placed inargument position of another proposition. Again, it should be recalled that asimple clause or sentence in natural language mostly expresses a proposition thatis logically speaking composite, that is, consists of several atomic propositions,as we have seen in the proposition schema introduced in the previous section.This means that, in order to avoid confusion, we should carefully distinguishbetween complexity at the surface structure level defined in terms of clauses,and complexity at the semantic level, defined in terms of propositions. Forsentential clause structure, we will therefore use the general term compositesentence to denote any sentence that consists of more than one clause, compoundsentence to denote sentences of which all clauses are of the same rank, andcomplex sentence to denote sentences of which at least one clause has differentrank, that is, in which there is at least one subordinate clause and acorresponding main clause in which the subordinate clause has a syntacticfunction. At the semantic level we will use in principle the same termscomposite, compound, and complex for propositions.4.2.1. Clause Structure and Propositional StructureFor our discussion the relationships between clausal or sentential structuresand propositional structures are of crucial importance. Our schema was devisedsuch that one simple clause corresponds to one propositional schema, consistingof an ordered set of atomic propositions, and one fact, which is the referent of theclause in some possible world. Thus, as soon as we have composite sentences wewill also expect composite schemata one schema may be coordinated orsubordinated with respect to another schema, as in sentences such as1 The professor hired an assistant who had written a dissertation ondiscourse comprehension.We assume that the complex proposition expressed by the second clause willbe embedded into the modifier category of the argument category patient whichhas the atomic proposition assistantb as its terminal filler. This assumption isbased on the interpretation that the second clause is used to further identify theassistantas would be the case if a definite article the assistant had been usedorto specify a property of some person, as in 1.Both intuitively and formally, Sentence 1 denotes one fact, namely, theaction of hiring somebody who has certain properties. I his tact is complexbecause the property of one of thearguments is described in terms of anotherprevious fact. But the sentential structure of 1 suggests that this embeddedfact indeed has no independent function other than to specify a main fact.121At this point, however, we should view sentential surface structure not onlyas an expression of underlying semantic structures, but at the same time as an expression of pragmatic functions. That is, the notions of main clause, mainproposition, and main fact seem to be related to that of the pragmatic act of anassertion. The pragmatic act of an assertion, however, also has a number ofcognitive propervies. Basically, for example, the pragmatic conditions must besatisfied that the speaker knows p, believes that the hearer does not know p, andwants the hearer to know p. The use of 1 signals that the speaker wants toassert something ahout the act of hiring. Although this is true in some sense, itcould be maintained that the speaker also asserts something about the assistant,hence about the fact that the assistant had written some dissertation. It followsthat if we want to establish link, smong sentences, propositions, and facts, bothfrom a semantic and from a praymatic point of view, we will have to introducethe concept of importance or focus. In that case, even if Sentence 1 denotes onecomplex fact, and hence several single facts, and even if the speaker is using 1in some context as an assertion, and thereby speaking about one complex fact orseveral single facts, a distinction may indeed be made between facts that arepragmatically and hence cognitively more important and those that are lessimportant. In other words, the proposition or fact consisting of the concept ofhiring is in focus here and appears to have more relevance in communicationthan the act of writing a dissertation. Of course, the syntactic, semantic,pragmatic, and cognitive hierarchies involved may be variable in differentcontexts. That is, several surface structure types may be used to change the focusof importance2 The professor hired an assistant. She had written a dissertation on discourse comprehension.3 The assistant who had written a dissertation on discoursecomprehencion was hired by the professor.4 The assistant who was hired by the professor had written a dissertationin discourse comprehension.From these examples we may observe that with varying surface structures weobtain at the same time various semantic and pragmatic interpretations. In 2 wehave two independent sentences, coordinated without a connective in adiscourse. Hence, we have two related assertions, and apparently also referenceto two independent, but related, facts. In 3 and 4 we again have complexsentences, complex propositions, and complex facts within one act of assertion,but the hierarchies are different from those in 1. In 3 it is still the factconsisting of the act of hiring which is most prominent, but nowintuitivelytheassertion seems to be rather about the assistant than about the professor. Or,rather, it is the assistant who is now in the focus of attention, and therefore thetopic of .3. In sentence or assertion 3 the fact of having written a dissertationon discourse comprehension is again merely used to identify, specify, orqualify one of the participants in the main fact. This situation is reversed in4 Here the main fact denoted, and hence the focus in the assertion, is theact of having written a dissertation, and the fact of having been hired is just a122specification of the participant. Note also that in 3 and 4, as opposed to 2,the propositions that are expressed by the restrictive relative clauses may bepresuposed, semantically by the sentence or pragmatically by the speaker. Thatis, they are assumed to be information already available to the hearer, either fromprevious text or from context.From this brief discussion about complex sentences and complexpropositions we may conclude that syntactic and semantic structures may besystematically related to pragmatic and cognitive structures. That is, the clausestructure not on expresses which propositional structure is involved, but alsohow we should see the facts, and hence what is asserted in the communicativecontext, what is know, unknown, or presupposed, what is more important andless important or requires more or less focus of attention.4.2.2. Relations among PropositionsInteresting for our discussion in all this is that there are variable ways tocommunicate about the same facts. The very construction of complex facts orsequences of facts may depend on pragmatic and cognitive criteria and is signaledby surface structure. Thus for a theory of discourse comprehension it is of primaryimportance to know how semantic information is placed in or distributed acroseveral sentences. In what follows, we will examine in more detail how cognitivefactors may determine these variations in the construction of facts and theircorresponding cognitive representations. First, we must have a more general,abstract picture of the relationships among sentences, their propositional meanings,facts, speech acts, and some cognitive features such as knowledge and importance.In order to understand fully Just what is going on when a sentence or aspeaker uttering itexpresses several propositions or refers to several facts, weshould examine in somewhat more detail the examples given earlier and givesome further examples. Returning to Examples 1 and 2 we see that in bothcases two complex propositions and two facts are involved. Yet, therelationship between the propositions and between the facts seems to bedifferent. Intuitevely, it seems that this relation is closer in 1 than in 2 In 1the fact consisting of writing a dissertation merely functions as a property of aparticipant in another fact, whereas in 2 the facts are much more independent.Apparently, sentences and discourse may express by their clausal structuredifferent relationships or different degrees of closeness between facts. Let us tryto spell out these degrees0. No relation. This zero case, in which there is no relation between the facts,would characterize forms of listing or incoherent discourse.1. Indirect coherence. The facts are part of the same possible world episode.Thus, they may share the same time, place, or argument, and will be part ofthe same macrofact, as denoted by a macroproposition and expressed bynoncontiguous sentences.2. Direct coherence. As in Degree 1 indirect coherence but in addition thefacts are temporally andor conditionally related, denoted by separate claus123es or sentences which are linearly ordered. The relation is expressed only oneway, for example, by sentence adverbials such as therefore, then, so, as, aresult, etc.3. Coordinated connection. As in Degree 2 direct coherence but now thefacts are mutually related, as cause and consequence, and form one orderedpair, triple, ntuple of facts, hence together one composite fact, presented as aunit, mostly by a compound sentence and explicit coordinating connectives.4. Subordinate connection. As in Degree 3 coordinated connection but nowthe facts are no longer sequentially but hierarchically ordered One fact istaken only as a specification e.g., a condition of the other, as is typicallysignaled by a complex sentence with full embedded clause in adverb position.5. Integration. As in Degree 4 subordinate connection but now it is nolonger the case that one fact is represented as conditioning or determininga whole other fact, but rather as determining only one aspect of the other fact,for example, as a specification of the manner of action or the property of aparticipant. Typically expressed by restrictive relative clauses.6. Reduction. As in Degree 5 integration but now the fact no longer has thefunction of a modifier, but is reduced to a noncomplex, atomic property, astypically expressed by adjectivization such as expected, fallen, etc..We see that these different relations existing between facts have typicalexpressions in the surface structures of the discourse. This means that it is thediscourse structure, and hence the speaker using this as interpretation indications,that suggests how the facts talked about should be identified and related by thehearer. Of course, there may be other factors, pragmatic or cognitive ones, thatmay establish other relations between the facts for the hearer. To this kind ofcomprehension variation we will return in what follows. With this abstractanalysis of fact relationships we now can see that Sentences 1 and 2 expressDegrees 5 and 2 of the hierarchy, respectively. The intermediate Degrees 3 and 4would be expressed by sentences like the following5 Susan wrote a dissertation about discourse comprehension and wastherefore hired by the professor.6 After Because she had written a dissertation about discoursecomprehension, Susan was hired by the professor.From the examples given and the hierarchy of fact relations they express wesee that a secuence of facts may gradually he merged into one composite orcomplex fact. As soon as the temporal or conditional nature of therelationship between the facts as wholes get lost, as in the integration case,the fact may be reduced to a complex or even simple property. It is in thissense that we may say that Sentence 1 is really about one fact, the action ofhiring an assistant. It would be theoretically inadequate to maintain for sucha sentence that one of the facts is part of another fact Writing a dissertationis not part of the fact of hiring an assistant. Rather we should say, perhaps,that the restricted relative clause expresses a proposition of which the124referential function is to identify, specify, or qualify a participant individual of afact. In that case a modifier proposition would denote not a fact but a property.Another option would be to accept reference to one, complex, fact, but such thatthe relation between the main fact and the subordinated fact only exists via theindividual in the main fact, which is asserted to participate in two facts. Note thatin unrestricted relative clauses we have a different situation There we certainlyhave two independent facts as referents, but only integrated surface structure tosignal the referential identity of the participating individuals. Finally, it might beargued that the factrelation hierarchy may be related to a similar hierarchy at thepragmatic level We may have degrees of assertiveness. The more facts aresignaled to be integrated, the less they will be assertedand often the more theywill be presupposed to be known. And similarly for the cognitive importanceMore integration will signal less relative importance of a fact.As the propositiunal schema discussed is related to clauses in the surfacestructure and facts as referents, this discussion about the relations betweensentences and the world also holds for the relations between propositions. Theresulting picture is that we have coherent sequences of propositions, also calledepisodes, composite propositions consisting of connected pairs, triples, ... , ntuples, and complex propositions of different kinds. Episodes are sequences ofpropositions dominated by a macroproposition, van Dijk, 1982b. Whereas thesedistinctions are abstract, we should now consider how a cognitive modelaccounts for the comprehension processes and the strategies operating on or withsuch propositional structures.4.3. PROPOSITIONS AS COGNITIVE UNITSAND AS STRATEGIES4.3.1. The Notion of Proposition in PsychologyThe account given in the previous pages of the notion of propositions has beefrather abstract, following predominantly a number of philosophical and linguisticcriteria for semantic analysis. We have noticed before, though, that this kind otapproach has also characterized much work in psychology and artificial intelligence. In part because of a lack of serious alternatives, the proposition has beentaken as a fundamental unit in cognitive semantics Surface structure input isassigned propositional interpretation. Again, we cannot give a full account here ofthe use of the notion of proposition in psychology. Earlier notions are those ufidea, thought, Gedankeninhalt, etc., although already in James 1950283ff. we find the notion of a proposition, taken as a combination of subject andpredicate. In modern cognitive semantics, it appears most of all in work on semanticmemory Kintsch, 1972, 1974. Clark and Clark 1977 make use of it extensively,but in most work in psycholinguistics and memory one fails to find it in theSubject indices. Whereas some researchers e.g., Norman  Rumelhart, 1975125use the notion of proposition, others e.g., Schank  Abelson, 1977 preferconceptual shemata of another type. Although Schank further analyzes predicatesconcepts into protopredicates, his conceptual dependency schemata alsoinvolve functional relations. In general, it can be said that there is nofundamental distinction between propositional representation formats andnetworks or graphs of various kinds, although the latter are not usuallyassociated with a formal semantics, and hence do not have unambiguousinterpretations. Of course, simple conceptrelation concept structures will notdothey fail to represent a host of linguistic aspects of propositions, such asadjectives, sentential adverbs, modalities, and so on see Woods, 1975. Ourschema differs from such networks, in that it represents the formal structure ofpropositions.The problem of cognitive relevance or the psychological reality ofpropositions is, however, rather complex. We have discussed some of the issuesinvolved in Chapter 2, but it cannot be our task here to fully unravel theintricacies of that problem. In a sense we will take propositions for granted astheoretical units of a cognitive model, but we will formulate a number of typicalpsychological operationsnamely, strategiesfor the reconstruction ofpropositions as part of the process of discourse understanding.Our claim that propositions are suitable units for a cognitive model is madein spite of repeated warnings from philosophers and logicians to the contrary. Aswe have seen in the first section of this chapter, several philosophers andlogicians have argued that, even if propositions can be taken as the meaning ofdeclarative sentences, they should not be identified with mental objects ofsome kind, but rather treated as abstract constructs. That is, they have arguedagainst the identification of a proosition with the full set of subjective cognitiverepresentations an individual may when producing or hearing a sentence. In onerespect, one need not quarrel with such an antisubjective approach to cognitivemeanings The conditions on interaction and communication indeed require thatmeanings not be purely subjective, ad hoc, or arbitrary through a process ofepisodical learning we must make abstractions and generalizations. This also holdsfor propositions taken as cognitive units. In this respect, propositions are indeedconceptual representations of what we may call possible facts. On the other hand,if we understand a particular sentence, uttered in a specific situation, andintended to refer to one specific fact, the propositional representation has, ofcourse, a different nature Instead of a structure of general concepts, we will havea structure of instantiated conceptsspecific individuals and their properties, hereand now. In that case further memorial or perceptual categories may beassociated with the propositionfurther knowledge, beliefs, opinionss, episodicmemories, and so on. This structured but fuzzy set will constitute the actualhearers meaning assigned to a sentence in a specific context. Here we encounterthe usual distinction between contextfree and contextsensitive meanings, orbetween sentence meaning and language users meaning, or between generalspecific meaning. Both are cognitively relevant, and, as a result of learning, ourgeneral meanings will be derived from specific meanings. Since we are engagedin the actual strategic processes of understanding it is obvious that we need both126kinds of meaning. First, we will still deal mainly with more abstract propositions,later these will appear to be further instantiated and enriched with subjectiveinformation. Ultimately we aim at a model of subjective understanding, but werecognize that such a model also needs a more objective, intersubjectivecomponent, accounting for generalized, abstract knowledge about languagemeanings, possible worlds, and possible facts.From a theoretical and methodological point of view there is no a priorireason not to adopt propositions as theoretical units of a cognitive model.Although it is wise in general not to introduce uncritically notions frontphilosophy, logic, or linguistics into psychological theories of languageunderstanding, we should remember that in all these disciplines the propositionhas always been assumed to account for meanings of sentences. Althoughphilosophers and linguists will usually abstract from the precise cognitive natureof such meanings, their theorizing is also very much determined by intuitionsand hence by a number of cognitive criteria. For instance, decisions aboutsameness or difference of sentence meanings, as represented by identical ordifferent propositions, are made on the basis of their intuitive knowledge ot thelanguage. In this respect, a psychologist devising a comprehension model wouldnot approach the problem in a very different wat. Second, if a cognitivepsychologist ignores considerations about the neurological basis of languageunderstanding and memory, the cognitive model also remains rather theoreticaland abstract. That is, there is a certain freedom in the theoretical language usedto describe cognitive phenomena. Just like the linguist, therefore, thepsychologist will aim at an adequate format for semantic representations. Only,instead of formal interpretations, the psychologist will be interested in realinterpretations, that is, in cognitive processes of comprehension. It suchprocesses can be formulated in terms of propositions, so much the better,because it makes a long tradition of philosophical and linguistic thinkingavailable to the psychologist. Third, both for the linguist and the psychologistthere is the severe constraint of Surface structure expression. For both it isrelevant to introduce as abstract or underlying theoretical units only those whichdirectly or indirectly manifest themselves in various surface structures. So, in thesame wav as we couple lexemes with discrete words, we will be inclined tointroduce complex semantic units to be coupled, by interpretation rules, withclauses or sentences. And, finally, original proposals from philosophy and logicfor the construction uf propositions have undergone serious revisions in the last10 years from linguists and psychologists alike, revisions that expressly try toaccount for wellfounded semantic intuitions about meaning.Thus, in the preceding discussion we did retain the notion of proposition, but atthe same time adopted the usual functional analysis in terms of semantic roles orcases. At the same time we have tried to build in some more hierarchical structure,and we have proposed to represent this in a prupositional schema, taken as a semanticrepresentation ofdenoted facts in some possible world. We will now argue thatindeed some form of propositional schema must be part of a cognitive model ofdiscourse comprehension, and of comprehension in general for that matter. In127particular, we will examine how cognitive strategies operate in the formation andtransformation of such propositional schemata.4.3.2 The Strategic Construction of PropositionsWhen we try to understand the world, that is, states of affairs, events, actions,or processes, or the discourse about these, we usually do not proceed in anarbitrary, haphazard, or ad hoc way. If we want to translate or decode the varioussurface structures of words and worlds, we had better have available handy rulesor other operations to accomplish such a complex task. This is well known at thelevel of objects We make socially and culturally relevant categorical distinctionsin the continuous flow of pure reality. Despite their variations in form and color,we therefore distinguish and appropriately categorize cars, chairs, and salami, sothat we can recognize instances of the same type of thing when we see or usethem. Specifically, we form concepts which represent these discrete distinctionsin things and properties of the world and we have learned to couple these withnatural language expressions. Thus, each concept may grow into a hierarchicalschema, a frame, representing the more important constant and variableproperties witch through experience have collected around such a concept.Similar remarks hold not only for things, properties, and relations, but alsofor processes, events, actions, and states in which such things and propertiesparticipate, that is, for facts. Unlike the number of objects and their properties orrelations, taken as types, the number of possible facts is infinite. This followsdirectly from the theoretical considerations given in the previous section.Although many of the facts, or rather fact types or fact concepts, we areconfronted with in our daily routines may be similar or identical, we are alsoconstantly confronted with many new facts. The question then is How do wehandle these facts How do we know a fact when we see one How do wedistinguish or isolate one fact from another fact And, how do we represent factsin memoryWe will assume henceforth that this understanding of what is going on in theworld, this fact analysis, has a strategic nature. That is, operations ofunderstanding are involved which are fast, flexible, dependent on existingcognitive structures such as knowledge, attitudes, but also goals, plans, orinterests, respecting of cognitive constraints such as shortterm memorycapacity limitations and longterm memory retrievability conditions usability ofinformation, and which allow variable input data. We will assume that the firstsemantic goal of such a strategy consist in the construction of a propositionalschema. In other words, we understand and thereby construct facts by setting up,strategically, a propositional structure. Although such propositional structuresallow rulegoverned variations, we assume that there are strategically preferredor stereotypical fixed or schematic versions. Such stereotypical schemata,derived from episodic experiences, account for the vast amount ofstraightforward fact analyses.We can only speculate about the precise nature of these proposition formation128strategies there are few experimental techniques to assess them. Intuitively, wemight assume that first a number of central participants are identified, possiblywith the focus on just one or two. Next, an analysis is made of the biophysicaltransformations movements, doings which define the processes, events, oractions in which these individuals participate, at the same time affecting otherindividuals persons, objects. In order to be able to learn and interact, though,we are less concerned with the identification and understanding of individualsWe want to keep track of the changes of the world, of changing properties,events, and actions. The cognitive focus of the facts we understand, hence, mustbe the predicate. In other words, we only assign a fact to the world or somesituation when we assign a predicate to a number of individuals. There seems tobe a double process at work here. First, there is the construction and maintenanceof routine propositions for the usual facts of observation and everydayinteraction familiar objects, person, places, and their familiar properties andrelations. Against the background of these episodically stored routinepropositions we have the construction of new facts, and hence new propositionswhich are relevant enough on the basis of our goals and interests. These newfacts represent our registration of what happens in the world. Of course, most ofthese new facts are still very mundane, and hardly relevant for specific treatmentand memory storage and retrieval, let alone for comrnunication for example, inthe form of stories.From this extremely informal and intuitive discussion we may conclude thatthe strategic construction of propositions, representing the cognitively relevantunderstanding of the facts of the world, seems to follow the propositional schemafrom bottom to top We establish, or, from previous fact understanding, havealready represented, some possible world, time, place, and other circumstancesstreet, room, town, etc. and summer, Sunday, afternoon, etc.. These serve tolocalize the state of affairs, events, or actions. Next we have or make arepresentation of one or more individuals objects, persons within this situation.And, finally, against this background of routine scanning we then notice newproperties or relations, that is, events or actions, in which these individuals areparticipating. Relative to each other and to the nature of the predicate conceptapplied, the individuals are then assigned their respective roles, for example, asagent, patient, or instrument. Thus, if a person is seen to bring about some doingintentionally, then that person is assigned to the agent category. The order of roleassignments is presumably strategically controlled If in some situation and byprevious observation or events the focus of attention is on some specificindividual, it seems plausible to assume that this individual will be assigned arole first in the state, action, or event. Of course, the kind of strategies we havedescribed informally here by definition do not account for all understanding. Insome cases, for instance, we may first have the assignment of a predicate typeto some event and only then the assignment of individuals and situation If wehear a specific sound, we may interpret it first as a crash and then assignindividuals such as cars, thereby interpreting the whole event as an accident.What we have described here as the strategic interpretation of reality in terms offacts by the construction of propositional schemata, essentially holds also for129Sentence and discourse understanding. Or rather, we should say, our generalunderstanding strategies will follow principles which are similar whether theinputs are real states, events, or actions, or whether the inputs are a pictorial orlinguistic representation of these. One essential difference, though, is that suchexpressions are already precoded, they already exhibit an understanding ofreality, and it is the task of the hearer or reader to reconstruct the intendedpropositions and hence the denoted Hrmann, 1976.As we will see in more detail in the next chapter, surface structures ofsentences and discourse provide indications for this kind of strategicunderstanding Word order, morphological structure, and syntactic categorieshelp build the propositional schema. Circumstantial information will initially betaken to be identical with that of previous text or will be inferred from context.First noun phrases, which often express topic function, will denote the individualcurrently in the focus of attention, who is often identical with the individual in aprevious proposition fact. Then, the predicate is interpreted as the new centralinformation about the property, event, or action defining the new fact, afterwhich subsequent noun phrases and complementizers will fill in the rest of theparticipant roles. If the background or circumstances change for the new fact,these will often be mentioned first, for instance, as sentence adverbials. In otherwords, the stereotypical ordering of English sentences expresses or indicateswhat strategies are preferentially followed in the routine construction ofpropositional schemata, and it seems reasonable to assume that these strategiesare similar to those followed in direct interpretation of the world in observationand action. In other words, all understanding takes place by strategicallyapplying the grid of a stereotypical schema to the incoming data, and we assumethat this schema is something like the propositional schema we have discussed.The same holds, of course, for languages other than English, except that the wayin which the schematic grid is made to overlay the data is different, eachlanguage having developed its own linguistic devices to achieve that purpose.4.3.3.Psychological ImplicationsSome of the assumptions made here about the cognitive nature of propositionshave been experimentally investigated. The basic idea in this experimentalapproach has been that if propositions are units they should be processed andrepresented as such in memory. To assess this unity of a set of concepts, we haveseveral experimental techniques. In Chapter 2 several studies were reviewedpurporting to demonstrate the psychological reality of propositions. The methodsused for that purpose include free as well as cued recall, reading time, and, aboveall, priming techniques. A great deal of evidence converges to suggest thatpropositions are, indeed, effective units in the cognitive system.Our propositional schema is in some respects similar to other propositionalformats proposed in the literature Kintsch, 1974 Anderson  Bower, 1973Anderson, 1976, 1980 Frederiksen, 1975 Norman  Rumelhart, 1975, but thereare also differences. First, our schema is really hierarchical It has higher and lower130level categories. Second, it contains atomic propositions and not just concepts.This means that the proposition contains a proper representation of variables orconstants, which is crucial for a theory of instantiation. Third, a specific modifiercategory has been introducedunlike the representation in logic, which takesmodifying information as separate, conjoined, propositions. Fourth, the predicatecategory and the argument or participant category are organized at a higherlevel by a specific predication node, for example, ACTION, PROCESS, STATE,or EVEN. Finally, we introduced a specific circumstance category, organizingnot only place, time, and conditions, but also the possible world. The lattercategory allows us to represent modalities such as maybe, certainly and tochange worlds within complex propositions, for example, after worldcreatingpredicates such as to believe, to dream, to pretend, etc. .If we assume that clauses are strategically interpreted as propositionalschemata, we must now examine how complex sentences and sentencesequences are understood in terms of propositions. We have seen in the previoussection that the facts of the world can be represented in discourse in severaldegrees of relatedness, ranging from indirect coherence to integration andreduction. That is, language users form sequences of propositions, composite andcomplex propositions. In the next chapter, we will be concerned with adiscussion of the strategies used to assign coherence relations betweenpropositions in sequences, typically those underlying subsequent sentences. Herewe will limit ourselves to propositional formation strategies. Our main point isthat although language users apply a propositional schema to sententialstructures, differences in surface structure will at the same time provide cues fordifferent propositional structures We have seen in the analysis of the previoussection that sentence sequence, compound or complex sentence structure will inprinciple also lead to similar propositional structures.The dependence of the propositional organization on the syntactic segmenttionof the surface structure of sentences has been amply demonstrated inpsychoinguistic experiments for a review see Fodor, Bever,  Garrett, 1974,and our discussion in Chapter 2. On the basis of these demonstrations,Tannenhaus and Carroll 1975 have formulated a principle which they call thefunctional clause hierarchy. This principle says that the extent to which asentence will be segmented at clause boundaries depends on how complete theinformation is which it provides. If there is enough in a clause to construct aproper proposition, the clause will be perceived as a unit. In this case the clauseboundary functions as a segmentation point. This has been demonstrated byCarroll and Tannenhaus 1978 with the click method. Clicks were perceived atthe boundaries of complete main clauses, even when they physically occurredbefore or after the boundary, but no clickshift occurred at the boundaries ofsecondary incomplete clauses. Townsend and Bever 1975 made the samepoint very clearly in a word recognition study. These authors presentedsubjects with sentences containing two phrases, with the first phrase eitherbeing an incomplete subordinate clause or a complete main clause. Test wordsfrom the initial clause were recognized more slowly when they came from amain clause than when they came from a subordinate clause, indicating that the131main clauses, but not the still incomplete subordinate clauses, belonged todifferent perceptual units. This effect was especially strong when theincompleteness of the subordinate clause was directly signaled in the text, forexample, by an although which specifically instructs the reader that he or she isdealing with a subordinate clause that must be interpreted in the context of amain clause yet to come.In this connection it is important to note that although readers are better ableto recall the exact wording of subordinate clauses than main clauses in shortterm memory experiments, nonverbatim, propositional recall is better for thecontent of main clauses Flores dArcais, 1978 Kintsch, 1974 Townsend Bever, 1978 Singer 1976 Singer  Rosenberg, 1973. We interpret this findingto mean that retrieval is more efficient for the principal slots in the propositionalschema, and subordinate information which is assigned to modifier orcircumstance slots is less retrievable.However, although syntax thus determines the propositional organization inpart, these stereotypical ways of handling information may also be influenced byother factors. Typical for comprehension strategies is that they not only considerlinguistic input structure, but also contextual information and available cognitiveinformation, such as knowledge, goals, or interests. This means that the samesurface structures may lead to different propositional structures in different contexts. This agrees with our intuitions about contextual variations of discourseunderstanding, but we should make explicit here which processes are involved inthis kind of variation. Let us give a simple example. Take, for instance, thefollowing short discourse fragments7 The professor hired a secretary. She has red hair.8 The professor hired a secretary who has red hair.Let us assume that 7 denotes two facts, namely, the fact that the professor hireda secretary, and the fact that she has red hair. Sentence 8, however, seem, todenote one fact, and in the propositional representation of this fact it will bementioned in the modifier category for the patient that the secretary has red hair.We see than the same world fragment may be interpreted as one or as two factsProperties may be expanded to full facts, or full facts may be reduced toproperties of individuals, as is also signaled in the surface structure. That in 7the fact that the aecretarv has red hair is singled out for separate assertion can beinterpreted in terms of the relevance or interest of that fact for the speaker or forthe speakers model of the hearer. In other words, discourse structure willexhibit not only an interpretation of the facts, but also the relevance, importance,or degree of interest of certain properties or relations, thereby assigning factstatus to them. A language user having heard 7 may later report about thesame fact with a sentence like S or even delete the fact about the red hair, incase he or she is not interested in redheads at all, or deems such informationsexist or irrelevant. In other words, given some sentence or discourse fragment,the language user will use information from the social, interactional, andcognitive context in order to construct a propositional textbase which neednot be congruent with surface structure indications of the speaker. The hearer132may upgrade properties to separate propositionai schemata or, conversely, reducevarious schemata to one schema. These strategies will be called propositionsplitting and proposition fusion, respectively. Of course, these strategies are notabsolute, but are defined relative to the structure of input discourse and itspropositional formation cues.Givn 1983 argues that whether some information is assigned a secondaryrole in a proposition, or more concretely, whether the corresponding phrase issuburdinated syntactically, depends above all on the pragmatic aspects of thecommunication situation. It is not necessarily the case that restricted relativeclauses are logically presupposed whereas main clauses are asserted, or that theycontain old known information whereas main clauses are reserved for newinformation. Counterexamples could easily be constructed. Relativization,instead, is based on a decision to background certain information in thediscourse. The main clause is ernphasized and is laid open to challenge. Thesubordinate clause is backgrounded and shielded from direct challenge. Indeed,Givon proposes an operational test, the challenge test That part of a sentencethat can be directly challenged forms the central proposition. Thus, it would bemore natural to say No, she did not have red hair after 7 than after 8. If thisconjecture is true, the challenge test could perhaps be made into a badly neededexperimental instrument for the investigation of propositional structure.The strategies for building propositions are very important in a general theoryof discourse production and comprehension. They account. first of all, for thefact that the same facts can be represented and described in different ways.Second, they explain why and how the same discourse may in turn be interpretedin different ways at the propositional level. We already know that the sameobjects, persons, properties, or events may according to knowledge and attitudesbe conceptualized in different wavs at the lexical stylistic level. We now seethat this also holds for the very construction of the facts denoted by thediscourse.From the above it follows that language users will use information from theactual sentence, from the representation of the previous part of the discourse,from the interactive context, and from their cognitive set when thev construct apropositional textbase. This may mean that what is presented as a new fact mayby fusion be inserted into the propositional representation of a fact that isalready known or, conversely, integrated information may be upgraded or evensplit off from the fact now being denoted. Thus, if for our example the heareralready knows that the professor hired a new secretary, the new informationabout her being a redhead may be represented as a modifier in the extantproposition or a new proposition may be set up. The latter will typically be thecase if the hearer believes this separate proposition may be needed for lateruse, either in understanding the same discourse or in order to form expectationsabout the course of events, say, if the hearer knows that the professor tendsto fall in love with or hates redheaded women. That is, assumptions aboutthe relevance or interestingness of states or events will tend to upgrade theseto separate fact status, so that for later processing they can becomeindependent conditions in the textbase. In other words, we may assume that if133information is upgraded to independent fact status, it will be easier to retrieve itthan if it is part of an embedded category in another propositional schema.Let us now summarize and further specify the propositional strategiesinvolved se understanding1. Given some information from or about a fragment of the world, try toestablish a propositional schema.2. Start construction of the schema with the information already presente.g., in the shortterm memory buffer, for example, with circumstantials andsome individualas with the topic of the sentence, then the content of thepredicate category, and then the respective other participants in the order of theirstereotypical occurrence in the predicate schema some action concepts requireonly an agent, e.g., walk, others only agent and patient, e.g., fire, and so on.Follow the Suggestions of word order, syntactic categories, or case endingsprovided by the surface structure.3. For composite sentences, follow the suggestions of the clausal structure,that is, interpret main clauses as main propositions and subordinate clauses asembedded propositions.4. If modifier information e.g., from adjectives is important of relevant,acording to the language users knowledge, beliefs, opinions, goals, or interests,for special use in further comprehension or interaction, it should be construed ina separate proposition proposition splitting.5. If new propositional information is assumed to be not particularlyrelevant, and if a proposition is actualized with the sanve participants, try toreduce the new proposition to a modifier or circumstance category in the oldproposition fusion.6. Known presupposed information should be used to retrieve reinstateprevious propositional schemata from the episodic representation for the ext. Thenew information of the sentence that has such presupposed clenents may betreated as in the above strategies that is, either it is inserted into the oldpropositional schema if the new information is not very relevant or a newpropositiunal schema is set up if the information is important.7. For all those surface structure devices which are used to assign specificfocus to any element of the proposition, try follow the splitting stratcgy e.g., incase of topicaliazation, cleft sentences intonation, etc..8. For ungrammatical or incomplete sentential input also follow the abovestrategies, searching previous sentence and situational context for the missingpredicate or arguments.The search for meaning at this level consists in the construction of propositionalschemata. Typically, the strategies that achieve this are not simply based on thecompleted surface structure of wellformed sentences. Instead, they operate onincomplete or ungrammatical information, and they also use information fromthe grammatical syntactic and semantic structure of previous sentences, as well as134represented information about the context, about the speaker, and about thecognitive set of the hearer knowledge, beliefs, etc.. This means that thestrategies do not only operate bottom up from the surface data, but also top downfrom more general expectations, such as those supplied by text, context,memory, or the previously constructed macroproposition of the discoursefragment. It is also this information which provides the criteria for decidingwhether some new information is relevant or important, so that it may beconstrued as a separate propositional schema, either in a compound withprevious ones or in a sequence. When in the next chapter we consider the waysin which strategies establish coherence relations between propositional schemataof a textbase, we will examine particularly how previous propositions can beused to construe subsequent propositions. In Chapter 9 we will consider howknowledge is used strategically in the construction of local propositions, and inChapter 10 we will analyze in more detail how episodic memory and a generaldevice for strategic control monitors the propositional strategies. There we willalso see how missing links i.e., information necessary for comprehension whichis not expressed by the text are inserted into the textual representation.4.4. A SAMPLE ANALYSISOF THE NEWSWEEK TEXTIn the previous chapter we have illustrated our model with an example takenfrom Newsweek see front endpapers of volume for text of article. We shallreturn here to this example to examine in more detail the strategic construction ofthe propositional textbase. Without a full parser, we let the propositionalstrategies operate on surface structure fragments, that is, on words and wordorder. We do not provide a full cognitive lexicon, so that meanings and theknowledge associate with them will also be fragmentary. Finally, our analysiswill only be illustrated on the first few sentences of the text and will only besemiexplicit, without spelling out all detail of the strategies involved. Let us startwith the first sentence, S1S1 Compared with the relative shades of gray in El Salvador, Guatemala isa study in black and white.It has been assumed that propositional strategies usually require a surfacestructure analysis in terms of clauses. That is, each clause of S1 is taken toexpress on complex proposition. Each clause is analyzed in terms of asingle or composite verb phrase and a number of noun phrases, in such a waythat the verb phrase is taken as the expression ofthe underlying mainpredicate of the complex proposition and the noun phrases as the expressionsof underlying arguments depending on thipredicate. These are, however,more or less abstract conditions on the propositional strategies becausestrategic interpretation takes place on line with the incoming surfacestructure input. This means, for instance, that for English, which is a135predominantly SVO language, first phrases will mostly be noun phrases, so thata vg and semantic function may be assigned to these even before the verb, andthe organizing predicate, has been processed. Thus, various structural andsemantic expectations are set up which need verification by further analysis. Weassume that each content word expresses an atomic proposition. whah in turnorganized in a complex proposition according to its assigned semantic functioncase. From semantic memory, each strategic step will draw grammaticalinformation about each word, and its meaning or other world knowledge relevantfor understanding.Since we have no standard representation format for strategies, we willsimply systematize the strategies, step by step, in a table see Table 4.1. Foreach given in the leftmost column, we specify the data drawn from semanticmemory. Thus, in the remaining columns we represent grammatical informationColumn A, semantic meaning B, reference C, further world knowledgeD, semantic function E, and various kinds of expectations F derived fromthis knowledge with respect to further structure and meaning. The course of online processing is indicated by the first column list of numbered entries. Theordering of Columns AF in Table 4. l does not imply sequential processingstarting with syntactic factors and proceeding to semantic analyses. As we haveemphasized elsewhere in this chapter, strategies are flexible, and, although it isuseful for descriptive purposes to distinguish between syntactic and semanticstrategies, no fixed processing sequence is thereby implied.Semantic strategies, as we said, have the construction of propositions as theirand they do so by trying to construct a propositional schema, a schema that isprogrammed. The provisionally assigned semantic functions E will enable theinsertion of the relevant meaning unit into such a schema. Whereas Table 4.1represents the strategic operations, Figure 4.4 captures the terminal product,namely, the complex proposition constructed for the sentence as a whole. In thenext chapter, we will see how these propositional schemata can be strategicallyrelated into a locally coherent textbase, although some of these interpropositionalrelations already are exhibited here, namely, when clauses, of a sentence expresspropositions hat are connected.Whereas functional grammars have come up with a number of usefulsemantics categories to analyze the semantic structure of action sentences, thereare still many expressions, for example, in state descriptions, that lack afunctional analysis. This means that we had to assign some expressions to ad hoccategories. Thus, the expression is a study in black and white in the main clauseis in fact a compound vate, with a proper verbal part, namely, the usual is a,and a nominal part functioning as a specification of the attribution. Wetherefore have used the predicatedependent category attribute as a specificfunction, in this case for the main nominal part, study and assign in black andwhite as a whole because denoting one color property to a modifying category.The embedded proposition expressed by the first clause features a predicate136137138Figure 4.4. Propositional structure of S1 of Newsweek text.with an implicit agent, namely, we, I, or Newsweek, denoting the author ofthe text. We have identified this implicit agent with the constant x0. In otherwords, this first clause can be interpreted as a conditional, for example, If wecompare....A theoretical problem also exists for expressions with a genitive, such shadesof gray, which we take as a complex object, described by a conjunction ofatomic propositions, in which shades of is a binary predicate. We might alsotake this latter atomic proposition as a modifier of gray.Note also that the locative participantnamely, El Salvadoris one of theparticipants dependent on the predicate compare It is about gray in ElSalvador, and not the comparing which takes place in El Salvador, which wouldplace the location in the higher level circumstance category, along with time. Wesee that for all complex propositions this circumstance category features a timecategory which has been filled with the pragmatically defined concept now,denoting the time of speaking writing, expressed by the present tenses in thesentence. If we inspect Table 4.1 and Figure 4.4, we see that the online strategicanalysis of the first sentence is rather unsuccessful, mainly because of theunresolved interpretation ot the metaphor A reader does not know yet what theauthor is trying to convey. What the reader does understand is that two countriesare compared, or rather the political situation in these two countries,denoted by pictorial expressions, denoting maybe an indistinct politicalsituation and a situation of marked contrast or opposition. Strictly speakingS1 is ungrammatical the Subordinate clause should specify a comparisonfor the subject in the main clause, namely Guatemala, and that would139be, for example, El Salvador, and not the situation in El Salvador. So we shouldhave had Compared with the relative shades of gray in El Salvador, we find asrudy in black and white in Guatemala. In that case we have a propercomparison between two properties of these countries. This means that a readermay be rather free in attaching the subordinated clause, and hence its underlyingproposition, to the main clause and the main proposition. Thus, the firstproposition may be a modifier for Guatemala, or a modifier for a study inblack and white or even for in blak and white. Following the syntacticstructure, we have appended the proposition as a modifier to the objectGuatemala. Another reading would be rendered by the expression Comparedwith El Salvador with its shades of relative gray, Guatemala is... , which meansthat the first proposition is itself complex, that is, El Salvador is itself modified,under an implicit predicate to have, with the property relative shades of gray.We assume that after Step 6, the now established links between Steps 3, 4, 5,and 6 result in an unsuccessful literal interpretation for this complex NP, whichmeans that a metaphorical interpretation must be given, based on generalknowledge about political situations, and the fact that colors are not usuallyassigned to countries. The same strategy will be necessary in the second, mainclause, but then the reader will already be prepared for a possible rhetoricaloperation, namely a metaphor, and will probably not first interpret literally at all.Strategically, the first NP of the main clause will be interpreted as representingthe topic of the sentence, that is, the information already established by themacroproposition expressed by the headline, referring to a country about whichsome predications will follow. In others words, Guatemala is the first relevantdiscourse referent, with respect to which other discourse referents may beintroduced. Yet, this only holds when we analyze the text in isolation. In general,first position embedded clauses have topical function, for example, of expressingpresuppositions. In our case, this may mean that previous articles in the sameNewsweek issue are about El Salvador, which is indeed the case, and this beingso, it is the first clause which exhibits the topic, especially El Salvador, and thefirst occurrence of Guatemala in this text is hence both the new topic and thefocus of S1.Another characteristic feature of this first sentence is the nearly completelack of knowledgeguided, topdown expectations. There are no general framesor scripts that seem to be activated, nor do the meanings of the words createspecial expectations. Only the predicate to compare requires two objects to becompared and possibly a feature of comparison. We have seen that theseexpectations may be satisfied in a rather vague way. That is, we either comparetwo countries or we compare properties of these countries, such as the politicalsituation, to which the metaphorical expressions refer.A special column C in our analysis is reserved for the referents of theexpressions. It is assumed that these construct or presuppose elements of the situationmodel in episodic memory, representing the political situation in Central America, aswell as the relations between this situation and the author of the text. As thereader may not immediately come up with this interpretation, the definite assign140Table 4.2141142Pretty modifies a predicate, not an argument.Figure 4.5. Propositional structurc of S1 of Newsweek text.ment of meaning and reference may have to wait until the end of the sentence oreven until the interpretation of the next sentence. It is in this reference columnthat we indicate the individual objects or properties referred to, which may inlater sentences be coreferred with, either implicitly by presupposition orexplicitly. The next sentence, S2, is less vague Table 4.2, Figure 4.5S2 On the left is a collection of extreme MarxistLeninist groups led bywhat one diplomat calls a pretty faceless bunch of people.The previous sentence had introduced two countries and compared them,presumably with respect to their political situation. Thus, a politics frame wasactivated which turns out to be crucial for the interpretation of the secondsentence. Thus, first we have to know that on the left is not just a concretelocation identification, but a political qualification of a position in the politicalspectrum. The associated knowledge is something like progressive, liberal,or socialist. And the expectation is that the right will also be mentioned.This is particularly the case after the political interpretation of bluck andwhite in S1 as marked contrast. The expectation generated fromknowledge on the basis of on the left is satisfied by extreme MarxistLeninist which indeed is a political property of some groups on the left.143Text element 7 led by sets up an expectation for an embedded relativeclause characterizing groups, as well as for an agent. A similar syntacticexpectation from 8 what.The quotation marks 11 announce the literal rendering of the words of anutterance. As expected in a news article, important political people verbally reactto political events or states of affairs. Characteristically, a newspaper may in thisway give valuations of groups or of events without committing themselvestheyjust quote somebody else. In this case the diplomat is even unidentified.Although a consideration of the role of opinions and attitudes in discourseprocessing is outside the scope of this book, their effect on the textrepresentation that is being constructed cannot be neglected. For the prototypicalNewsweek reader, the modifier MarxistLeninist has undoubtedly negativeconnotations, which are enhanced by the negative implications of the phrasepretty faceless bunch. We shall point out later that this negative evaluation playsan important part in justifying the macroproposition suggested by the title of thearticle, namely, that there are no political choices in Guatemala, with Marxists onone side and death squads on the other.Although we will not provide a full analysis of S3, we see that the schematicexpectation, derived from the phrase on the left is indeed satisfied The group onthe right is now mentioned, in the same rhetorical manner. Again, much politicalknowledge is called for in order to understand and link elite, dominated,CIAbacked coup, etc. In S4 it then becomes fully clear what the graymetaphor of S1 meant, namely, the political center, which does not exist inGuatemala, but still does exist in El Salvador hence the difference in politicalsituation, and hence the meaning of the macroproposition.Thus, the interpretation of clauses and sentences by constructing, on line, apropositional schema is guided by information from the previous sentences, andsometimes as for S1 by information from following sentences. As soon as wehave identified a politics frame, and in particular the subsystem of political partyrelationships, a system of expectations is set up which allows the specificinterpretation of expressions of concepts fitting such a framc. Thus, on the leftwill trigger this specific subframe, will easily actualize MarxistLeninist, set upexpectations about on the right and in the middle as they indeed appear innext sentences. Within the domain of activated political knowledge as describedin detail by Carbonell, 1979, we then may arrive at a particularmacrostatement, as expressed by the title, and which will organize the online,that is, linear, description of the political situation characterized as beingwithout choices. The political spectrum information of the schema will providethe information about the possible groups, the comprehension of their typicalproperties, and the respective evaluations. This is precisely what the first fewsentences of this text convey. In the next chapter we will pay some moredetailed attention to the coherence links between these sentences, but is hasalready become clear at this point that propositional strategies for theinterpretation of clauses and sentences cannot operate independently They need144 4 PROPOSITIONAL STRA I f ,144information from other sentences, from the macroproposition titles, headline, oras provisionally inferred from previous sentences, from the context knowledgeabout Newsweek, communicative setting, and from more general politicalknowledge.We have earlier argued that overall sentence structure is a strategic indicationfor the underlying structure of complex propositions. The textbase does notsimply consist of an ordered sequence of discrete atomic or simplepropositions, but may feature very complex propositions. Depending on theknowledge and beliefs of the reader, there may be strategies that fusepropositions even when expressed in one sentence. Also, the relationshipbetween possible propositional structure and the structure of the sentence tells ussomething about the strategies of the author. In the case of S2, for example, thequalification of the leaders of the MarxistLeninist groups is provided in a deeplyembedded proposition, as is suggested by the embeded clause what one diplomatcalls. In this way, the negative evaluation is put in focus position of thecomment, and hence receives specific attention, even if it structurally has only alow position in the main proposition. This means that the reader may operatesuch that the embedded qualification comes out much higher namely, as a directmodifier of the leaders or even of the groups themselves. This is a strategy ofupgrading propositions, that is, attaching them to higher level concepts in thepropositional schema. Also, in our example it may be possible that a readerengages in proposition splitting by taking the embedded qualification as anindependent proposition They are a pretty faceless bunch of people.Alternatively, this splitting may happen with This is what a diplomat callsthem, which would highlight the fact that it is merely an opinion of someunidentified person. In other words, there is no fixed outcome for the finalpropositional structure Depending on what we know, believe, or find, we mayupgrade or downgrade propositions. The model would predict that the higher theproposition in the schema, and hence in the textbase, the more prominent it willbe for macroproposition formation and hence for recall and further use. Theindications provided by the structures of the text therefore, are powerful cues ofthe cognitive representation, and hence of the beliefs and opinions of the author.4.5. EXPERIMENT 1 PROPOSITION FUSION1How a set of elementary propositions is organized into complex text propositionsdepends on the organizational strategies that are used. These depend, in turn, on theway the text is written, among other factors. We shall investigate here a specificcase where the nature of the surface expression determines the propositionalorganization, and hence the readers memory performance. Specifically, we shall1This study was performed by Ugo Racheli as part of a Masters thesis at theUniversity of Colorado.145be concerned with proposition fusion the circumstance under which semanticelements that are realized in the surface structure as two separate sentences arefused to form a single complex proposition.Suppose we have a sentence S in the context of some brief paragraph wichexpresses the atomic propositions P1  Pk  Pn. Other things equal, weassume that readers have a strategy to organize these propositions into thecomplex text proposition T1. In contrast, suppose we have a twosentence textS1S2, where S1 is based on P1  Pn and S2 is based on Pk. The strategy thattakes sentence units as cues for forming complex text propositions would leadthe reader to form two separate text propositionss T1 organizing P1  Pn, andT2 for Pk. Pk would thus be especially emphasized, whereas in the former casePk would merely fill a slot of T1, or be appended to it as a modifier.What would be the behavioral consequences of this organizationaldifferenceThese depend on the context of the paragraph in which this material isembedded. Because Pk is emphasized and upgraded so that it forms a separatetext unit, it becomes more available for later processing, for example, whenadditional material relevant to that unit occurs in the text, or when it becomesmacrorelevant. In such circumstances, signaling out Pk, emphasizing it by givingit its own sentence, should facilitate later comprehension processes. However,suppose the paragraph never returns to Pk, and Pk turns out not to be animportant globally significant piece of the text, but some detail that wasmisleadingly emphasized. Text propositions containing a single element arecertainly not very efficient, unless that element is a very important one for thetext as a whole. One of the readers strategies would be to avoid suchconstructions. Thus, brief one or two proposition sentences in a paragraphmight produce a conflict situation On the one hand, there is a tendency to form anew complex proposition on the other hand, there is an opposing strategy toprevent setting up new propositions unless there is enough material there, orunless there are some indications of macrorelevance.Thus, there are opposing predictions, and it is not clear what the behavioraloutcome should be. If a new text unit is formed, one would expect that thematerial involved would be more available in recall than when it was embeddedin some subordinate position in another complex unit. On the other hand, if nonew unit is formed, a priori predictions are difficult to make Possibly, thematerial from the single sentence will be integrated in the larger unit in just thesame way as if it had been expressed within the larger sentence, so that theform of the surface structure would make no difference possibly, however, thisintegration into the larger unit would be more difficult now, so that theseparate sentence would be recalled less well. This latter outcome could occurwhen it is not quite clear how to incorporate the single sentence in the largerconstruction. If P1  Pk  Pn are all expressed by a single sentence, the roleof Pk visavis the other propositions may be indicated by the syntax of thephrase expressing Pk. For instance, an adjectival modifier calls for appendingthe proposition to the slot of the schema containing its head noun. However,if Pk was presented out of its proper context, more complex strategies are146Table 4.3Two Versions of Sample Paragraph with Question for Cued RecallTHE ROBBERY Paragraph 1Embedded versionAt exactly a quarter past two in the morning, a man entered the isolated convenience store with aloaded gun in his hand and asked for all the money in the cash register.

Italics wcrc not in tile original called for to redintegrate it, requiring more effort, and increasing the likelihoodof an encoding failure. Thus, emphasizing Pk by expressing it as a separatesentence might actually lead to poorer recall.4.5.1. Design, Subjects, and MaterialsSixty subjects who were students at the University of Colorado participatedin this experiment. Each subject read 12 brief paragraphs, presented in randomorder, and then was tested for recall on 4 of them. Free recall tests were used for6 of the paragraphs and cued recall for the other 6. All 12 experimental paragraphswere used. Each paragraph was written in two forms. In the embedded version, asimple clause, usually expressing a single proposition, was embedded into alonger sentence. In the separate version, a separate sentence was included inplace of the embedded clause. In all other respects the embedded and separateversions of the paragraphs were alike. The subjects were divided into six groups,such that each paragraph was read by 10 subjects in each version.Table 4.3 provides an example of the two versions for one of the experimentalparagraphs, as well as the question for the cued recall test. The instructions for thefree recall test would have been List all the facts in the ROBBERY story yourememberthough only cued recall tests were given for this particular story.Scoring was done for the presence or absence of the key wordloaded in theexample in Table 4.3. Close synonyms were accepted.4.5.2. ResultsThe results are summarized in Table 4.4. Cued recall was better when subjectshad read the embedded version of the paragraphs 58 than when they had read theseparate version 42. This difference was significant statistically both in analyses147Table 4.4Percentage Cued and Free Recall for the Paragraphs Used inExperiment 1 as a Function of Embedded and Separate Presentationof the Critical InformationParagraph numberVersionEmbedded SeparateCued recall1 50 202 70 703 90 904 90 705 30 06 20 058 42Free recall7 0 08 20 109 20 1010 40 2011 80 4012 30 1032 15over paragraphs t 5  2.99, p  .05 and over subjects sign test, z  2.40, p .05.

When theseparagraphs were written, these color words appeared rather unimportant,somewhat redundant, and quite irrelevant. Nevertheless. subjects rememberedthese words much better than any other adjectives in these paragraphs, almostirrespective of condition, creating a ceiling effect. We are somewhat puzzled whycolor words were singled out in this way. The only other case were performancewas unusually high ocurred in Paragraph 11, where the critical item was veryinformative and presumably of importance to the text as a whole. In contrast, thecritical item was entirely redundant in Paragraph 7, and no subject reproduced it.For the free recall data, if the critical item was recalled at all, it could berecalled either in a separate sentence or in embedded form. When subjects had readthe embedded version, 47 of their recall occurred in embedded form and 53 asseparate sentences. For the subjects who received the separate version, these valueswere 55 and 45, respectively, A chisquare test does not yield evidence that148these proportions are sicnificantly different for the two versions, X2 1  .16, p 31.4.5.3. DiscussionThe finding that recall was worse when a proposition was emphasized byputting it into a separate sentence, rather than embedding it in a larger sentence,indicates that subjects may have used a strategy of proposition fusion in thisexperiment. For the reasons outlined in the introduction to this experimentthesentence in question was too short, a, content did not appear to be rnacrorelevantthey, chose to integrate the inforrnation expressed in the separate sentence intothe complex proposition already formed, instead of constructing a new one. Thisintegration was apparently somewhat more difficult when the information to beintegrated was expressed in a separate sentence than when it was alreadyembedded into a larger sentence matrix.If we assume that the critical information was always encoded as part of asuperordinate complex proposition, regardless of which version subjects had, it isnot surprising that the form of recall as separate sentence or embedded phrasedid not depend on the version. The relatively high incidence of separate sentencesin recall can be explained by task demands Subjects were asked to list all factsabout the paragraph they could remember, which encouraged a listlike organizationof their protocols, and hence separate recall of facts, in spite of the presumablyintegrated memory organization.This little study represents no more than an initial exploration of how thememory structures that readers build up depend on the way in which the textthey read is written. We have observed here an instance of proposition fusionMaterial that was expressed in separate sentences was combined in one complexproposition. In essence, the brief, separate sentences which were used in theexperimental texts gave the Subjects contradictory cues On the one hand, theyappeared important just because they were separate on the other hand, they didnot lead anywhere. In the end, subjects handled them less well than if they hadbeen misleadingly marked as important, as indicated by their consistently poorerrecall. Obviously, this is just one configuration, and other strategies in othercontexts need to be similarly investigated before a complete picture can emerge.Chapter 6Macrostrategies6.1. THE NOTION OF MACROSTRUCTUREIn the previous chapter it was argued that discourse coherence should beaccounted for at both the local and the global level. Local coherence has beendefined in terms of relations between propositions as expressed by subsequentsentences. Global coherence is of a more general nature, and characterizes a discourse as a whole, or larger fragments of a discourse. Notions used to describethis kind of overall coherence of discourse include topic, theme, gist, upshot, orpoint. All these notions say something about the global content of a discourse.and hence require explication in terms of semantic structure. The notion ofmacrostructure has been introduced in order to provide such an abstract semanticdescription of the global content, and hence of the global coherence of discoursevan Dijk, 1972, 1977a, 1980a.Macrostructures are not the only global structures of discourse. For at leastcertain discourse types, it is useful to speak also about the schematic structure.Thus, stories can be characterized by a narrative schema, and argumentationshave usually been analyzed in terms of argumentative schemata, for example, thesyllogism of Aristotelian logic. Such schematic structures, which we callsuperstructures, provide the overall form of a discourse and may be madeexplicit in terms of the specific categories defining a discourse type.Macrostructures, then, are the semantic content for the terminal categories ofthese superstructural schemata. Although the cognitive understanding ofmacrostructures and superstructures is an integrated process, we will discusssuperstructural strategies separately in the next chapter.190In an abstract, linguistic, semantics of discourse, macrostructures are definedby rules, the socalled rnacrorules. It is a fundamental principle of both linguisticand logical semantics that the interpretation of certain units be defined in termsof the interpretation of their constituent parts. Thus, the definition ofmacrostructures by means of macrorules must also be based on the meanings ofthe sentences of a discourse, that is, on the propositions expressed by them. Asmacrostructures are, by definition, also semantic units they must also consist ofpropositions, namely, macropropositions. A macroproposition, thus, is aproposition that is derived from the sententially expressed propositions of adiscourse. In other words, macrorules are semantic mapping rules They relateproposition sequences with proposition sequences at a higher level, and thusderive the global meaning of an episode or a whole discourse from the local,sentential meanings of the discourse.Macrorules are recursive. Given a sequence of macropropositions, they mayapply again and thus derive a still higher level of macrostructure. It follows thatthe resulting macrostructure of a discourse is a hierarchical structure, consistingof several levels. Hence, the notion of macroproposition is relative It is definedrelative to the sequence of propositions local or global from which it is derivedby a Inacrorule.The macrorules that have been defined in the theory of discourse are thefollowing1. DELETION Given a sequence of propositions, delete each propositionthat is not an interpretation condition e.g., a presupposition for anotherproposition in the sequence.2. GENERALIZATION Given a sequence of propositions, substitute the sequence by a proposition that is entailed by each of the propositions of thesequence.3. CONSTRUCTION Given a sequence of propositions, replace it by aproposition that is entailed by the joint set of propositions of the sequence.These brief definitions of the rules neglect many formal details and further constraints. We see, however, that the rules are a form of reduction rules Theydelete propositions or replace sequences of propositions by a singlemacroproposition. At the same time they assign a further organization to themeaning of a discourse Sequences are no longer organized only at the locallevel, by linear relations of coherence as discussed in the previous chapter, butalso by higher level conceptual units.Figure 6.1 sketches the formal structure of a textbase. The macrostructure isthe subgraph labeled with M nodes. The P nodes form the microstructure. Forshort discourses, we should also provide for the possibility that the local and theglobal meaning coincide. In that case Rule 1 DELETION applies vacuouslyAll the propositions of the text are then also relevant at the global level.Obviously, the notion of semantic macrostructure is only needed for moreextended discourses, to which such notions as topic, upshot, or gist apply.Our account is still missing a number of fundamental features. For one thing,191Figure 6.1. The formal structure of a textbase.the rules presuppose that a discourse is fully explicit, that is, that it expresses allpropositions that are interpretation conditions for following sentences. However, itis well known that natural discourse is not explicit in this way. Manypropositions need not be expressed, as the speaker may assume that they areknown to, or can be inferred by, the hearer. Just as for the establishment of localcoherence, the rules presuppose that a number of propositions can be supplied bythe knowledge set of u language user. Thus, this knowledge set, K, indicateswhen a proposition is an interpretation condition for other propositions. For theGENERALIZATION rule. k specifies when a concept is a superconcept for otherconcepts. Similarly, K specifies when a sequence of propositions jointly entails ahigher level proposition as is required for the CONSTRUCTION rule. Thesequence X goes to the airport, X checks in, X waits for boarding,.  entailsthe macroproposition X is taking a plane, given the appropriate worldknowledge in the form of frames or scripts. Typically, a discourse will onlyexpress some propositions of such a sequence. So that additional propositionsfrom K are necessary to derive the macroproposition. Hence, macropropositionsare abstractly derived from sequences of propositions relative to some set ofpropositions, K, representing the world knowledge of language users.6.2. MACROSTRUCTURES ANDDISCOURSE UNDERSTANDINGWhereas the abstract account of macrostructures given in the precedingsection may be relevant for a linguistic semantics of discourse, it is insufficientfor a cognitive model of understanding. Even though the cognitive notion ofknowledge appeared to be necessary in the abstract account, a cognitive modelwill have to be much more complex. In addition to, or instead of, the rulesdefined we will need at least the following1. A definition of the actual processes by which macrostructures are derivedfrom sentences of a discourse1922. A specification of the strategies used to effectively handle the sometimesvast amounts of information necessary in the application of such processes3. An explication of the various types of information used by these strategies,henceforth called macrostrategies4. A specification of the memory constraints on macrostrategies5. A characterization of the memory representation of semantic macrostructures and their relations with other discourse and episodic representation.6. A specification of the knowledge types and strategies necessary for theapplication of macrorules and strategies7. An explication of the role of macrostructures and macrostrategies in thecognitive account of local coherence assignment8. An explication of their role in the understanding of superstructures9. A specification of the relevance of macrostructures in processes ofretrieval and reproduction of discourse10. A specification of the role of macrostructures in the performance of unumber of discourserelated tasks, such as summarizing, question answering,problem solving, or learning i.e., the formation or transformation of knowledge,but also of beliefs, opinions, and attitudesSome of these specifically cognitive properties of macrostructures were already built into our previous discourseprocessing model Kintsch  van Dijk.1978. Although the account of macrostructures given in that model was still predominantly static or structural, it predicted at least some experimentallyconfirmed ideas about the organization of discourse in episodic memory and themajor characteristics of related retrieval, recall, and summarization. Lacking wasa more dynamic or strategic approach, in which the precise processes arespecified by which a macrostructure is actually inferred from text andknowledge. Similarly, the various textual and contextual cues used by thelanguage understander to apply such strategies have not been systematicallydiscussed. And, finally, this abstract, structural description ofmacrounderstanding could hardly provide a sound explication of individualdifferences and differences in tasks, goals, or interests in the formation ofmacrostructures.This last point needs further comment. Linguistic semantics has usually proceeded from the hypothesis that the meaning of expressions should be specifiedindependently of contextual and personal variations, which were left to psycho andsociolinguistics. Hence, for a given language community and in a specific period,the meaning of words and of sentences was assumed to be a more or less abstract,stable, or at least intersubjectively invariant, conceptual structure, characterizingthe language system as opposed to actual language use. The global meanings ofdiscourse as defined in terms of semantic macrostructures similarly had this abstract, invariant nature A nonambiguous text was assigned a single macrostructure.Such an assumption is inadequate in a cognitive model of language use The actualunderstanding of a discourse will depend on the variable cognitive features oflanguage users and on the context. In other words, depending on different in193terpretation strategies, different knowledge. beliefs, opinions, attitudes, interests,or goals, each language user will assign his or her own macrostructure to a discourse. Different readers will find different meanings prominent, important, relevant, or interesting, and will assign different topics or gist to the discourse. Thismay seem obvious by now, but psychology has been uncomfortably close to linguistics in trying to provide more abstract and generalized models of language understanding. This is not wholly incomprehensible from a methodological point of viewA cognitive model will not specify how John or Mary understand a discourse, buttry to formulate general principles. Similarly, adequate verbal communication ispossible only if language users have meanings and knowledge in common. Therefore, an adequate cognitive model of macrostructures should specify the generalprinciples followed by all language users in understanding the global meanings ofdiscourse, and show how individual differences presuppose sufficient commoninformation to make communication adequate. Whatever the individual cognitivemakeup of a language user, he or she can not assign completely arbitrary ordisparate macrostructures to a discourse. The speakers intentions as expressed bythe text or reasonably ascribed to the speaker by the hearer on other grounds willplay a normative role in the derivation of macrostructures.6.2.1. The Linguistic and Cognitive Realityof MacrostructuresIt has hitherto been assumed that macrostructures are structures of discourse,Just as both linguistics and psychology usually speak of the meaning of wordsor sentences. In a cognitive model such a way of speaking is not quite adequate.It is more appropriate to account for meanings, and hence also for globalmeanings, as being assigned to a discourse by language users in processes ofunderstanding or interpretation. But, strictly speaking, this is also true formorphophonological and syntactic structures as they are assigned to the phoneticstring of an utterance. Hence, phonological, morphological, syntactic, andsemantic structures assigned to a sentence or discourse by abstract rules orcognitive operations, areas a shorthandsaid to be structures of these sentencesor discourses. There is no reason to make an exception for the global meaningswhich we explicate by means of semantic macrostructures.One possible argument against this assumption might be that macrostructuresare only inferred from a discourseif they exist at alland therefore do notbelong to the meaning representation of a discourse, but at most to a cognitivemodel. The criterion used here would be that, unlike the meaning of words orsentences, macrostructures are not directly expressed by expressions of the discourse, and therefore cannot be part of the linguistic meaning of a discourse. Thisargument is wrong, however, not only for a cognitive model of discourse understanding, but even for a linguistic semantics if it still makes sense to make a cleardistinction between these two. First of all, macrostructures are often directly expressed in the discourse, for example, in titles, thematic sentences, and words or in194summaries. Second, their presence in the meaning of a discourse is often signaled inother ways Pronouns, connectives, adverbs, topiccomment articulation, wordorder, and so on, often presuppose previous underlying macropropositions and theirelements macropredicates or macroarguments, and cannot be accounted for solelyin terms of the meanings of individual previous sentences. Third, the local coherenceof discourse, as established between subsequent sentences cannot be fullyexplained only in terms of local relationships between propositions Higher levelmeanings are necessary to establish some form of global organization or control.And, finally, there is no serious reason why an account of such empirically relevantnotions as topic, theme, gist, or upshot would fall beyond the boundaries of alinguistic or cognitive semantics, any more than other implied meanings, signaledby sentence structures and sequence structures, such as presuppositions, wouldbe deemed to be outside the scope of semantics.Of course, this argument does not imply arbitrary extensions of either linguisticor cognitive semantics. Thus, we would not say, for instance, that any personalassociation connected with the understanding of a discourse would be part of themeaning of a discourse. Similarly, we would not take the vast amounts of knowledge presupposed or implied by the meaning of a text to be part of the semanticrepresentation of that text. Although we do not consider it a wise strategy tocircumscribe precisely the scope of linguistic semantics, and certainly not ofcognitive semantics, we provisionally assume that the meanings of a discourseshould be expressed or signaled, directly or indirectly, by the surface structuresof the text. Semantic macrostructures are signaled directly by thematic sentencesor words, connectives, pronouns, etc., or else they are expressed indirectly bysequences m sentences.For a cognitive model such methodological issues may be much less relevantbecause meanings are constructed out of various knowledge units, that is, cognitivestructures. In other words, understanding a discourse is a process of inferencemaking at all levels, both at the levels of word, phrase, and sentence meanings andat the more global level of macrostructures. As Slobin cited in Bates  MacWhinney, 1982 187 put it Language evokes ideas it does not represent them. Fromthat perspective, the macrostructure of a discourse is the conceptual global meaningassigned to it. This assignment is based both on textually manifested surface andmeaning structures on the one hand and on various knowledge or other purelycognitive structures on the other.6.2.2. Macrostructures as an Organizational DeviceSemantic macrostructures of discourse in a cognitive model not only are meantto account for notions such as topic or gist or to explicate aspects of global coherence. They have also been postulated for more fundamental cognitive reasons.Macrorules are also rules of information reduction and organization. Large sequences of complex semantic structures, such as sentences, pictures, natural scenes,or actions, cannot be properly handled without higher level structures of some kind.195When we understand a text, we no longer have access to all previoussentences we have read, and the same holds for the everyday understanding ofevents and actions. of which the multiple details can only be partially retrieved.If, however, large sequences of semantic structures of this kind can be subsumedby macrorules under a few hierarchically structured macropropositions, and ifsuch macrostructures are a sufficient basis for the further understanding of thediscourse, the events, or the actions, then the extremely complex task of keepingsome order in the vast amounts of semantic details can be managed. That is, wehave a a common semantic basis to connect sometimes apparently incoherentsequences b a relatively simple semantic structure which may be kept in shortterm memory c a device for the hierarchical organization of the sequences inepisodic memory d an important cue for the actualization of knowledge forlonger stretches of discourse, events, or actions e powerful retrieval cues forthe sometimes necessary reactivation of semantic details and f an explicitconstruction defining the essential, the most important or relevant semanticproperties of a discourse or episode. This information is needed for latercognitive tasks learning, recall, action planning, as well as for monitoring andcontrolling further discourse processing.Macrostructures in discourse understanding are far from a luxury Withoutthem these complex tasks could not possibly be performed. It is thereforestriking that, although macrostructures of some kind have been adopted in somemodels of discourse comprehension Bower, 1974 Cirilo, 1981 Cirilo  Foss,1980 Reder  Anderson, 1980 Lehnert, 1980a, Schank  Lehnert, 1979Vipond, 1980 Graesser, 1981, there are still models that only operate at a locallinear level. Note also that macrostructures cannot simply be replaced byhierarchical structures of knowledge, such as frames or scripts. The latter areindeed structures of knowledge and have a general and sometimes stereotypicalnature, whereas macrostructures are structures of the discourse itself andtherefore are often unique. Thus. although macrostructures are formed with thehelp of hierarchical knowledge structures, they are by no means identical withthem. Only the concepts defining a macroproposition are inferred with the helpof world knowledge. We know that going to the airport, checking in, boarding,etc., together are concepts that at a higher level may be organized in the actionconcept of taking a plane, and we know that dogs, cats, and canaries areinstances of pets, and finally we know that many properties or actions which arepart of our everyday behavior are merely preparatory or component details ofmore important states, events, or actions. A crucial aspect of complexunderstanding, therefore, is higher level concept formation, organization, andhence reduction. This means that the communicative or interactional goals of adiscourse or sequence of actions cannot be planned or understood just in terms offinal results or terminal statesthat is, locally, as those of final sentences oractionsbut only as goals of higher level propositions, speech acts, actions. Inother words, macrostructures cannot be replaced by some other concept, say, bythe notion of goal as it is often used in accounts of action or action discourse andstory understanding. Only global purposes or goals, that is, plans, would qualifyin this respect, and they are defined in macrostructural terms.196After these more or less general preliminaries and methodological caveats,we are now able to address the question of how language users actually infermacrostructures.6.3. CONTEXTUAL MACROSTRATEGIES6.3.1. Possible Topics and Discourse TypesGiven the central importance of macrostructures in the processing of complexinformation, it is imperative that language users try to make intelligent guessesabout what a discourse fragment is about. That is, they will use effective strategic,to derive a macroproposition. Unlike macrorules, operating on full sequences, suchstrategies may only need some hints to make powerful predictions. This is possibleonly when all relevant information is used to arrive at such hypothesesnot onlytextual information, but also contextual, as well as much world knowledge. Onceinferred in this bottomup manner, a hypothesized macroproposition may be usedas a topdown device to understand subsequent sentences, which, of course, alsoprovide a check on the correctness of the hypothesis.Not all discourses are equally predictable. But even if the individual sentence,are not predictable in detail, many discourses have topics or themes that are more orless stereotypical. Since there are so many regularities in events and actions, thediscourses about them may be macrostructurally regular, too. Thus, in news storieswe may expect that if the Russians do such and such the Americans will act so andso Carbonell, 1978. That is, once given a certain theme about some event we maypredict what will happen. This is also true of trivial literature romantic stories,crime stories, spy stories, and so on, and even in psychological research reports. Inother words, our knowledge about conditions and consequences in the world willoften provide us with expedient expectations about the course of a discourse.Clearly, some discourse types may picture some world of their own, which is notalways similar to the real world A happy ending may be conventionally expectedin the text even if in real life we know better.On the other hand, most discourse types will not be predictable in this way. Forobvious pragmatic reasons, most of the information provided needs at least to benew in some way. That is, a discourse will often be about the unpredictable or theunexpected. Everyday stories and news stories will be about the funny, dangerous,or otherwise interesting actions and events of life. A psychological paper or atextbook must provide us with information we did not know and cannot easilypredict. Of course, we often have mixed cases Given an account of an unexpectedevent or action, our knowledge of the world may supply us with expectations orpredictions about what plausibly may follow.Thus, one type of macrostrategy is based on our knowledge of the worldBecause discourse is about real or fictitious possible worlds, about which we already have large amounts of knowledge and beliefs, we know what to expect.197Another set of strategies pertains to our knowledge about certain discoursetypes. We know what kind of actions or events are typically described in variousdiscourse genres In news stories we expect political events or actions, or otherwiseimportant events such as disasters, but not a description of uninteresting, trivialeveryday actions or events. Thus, it seems that most discourse types have constraints on the set of possible topics, a set which we may call the topic set of adiscourse type. Clearly, this set is fuzzy, and depends on sociocultural norms,values, and interests. What is interesting or reportable here and today will not beelsewhere or tomorrow.Topic sets are not limited to discourse types. They may also be associated witha culture or subculture, a communicative context or situation, with roles, functions,or positions of social members, and finally with age, sex, or personality of speakers. Since relevant actions and events differ across cultures, we will speak or writeabout different things than will the inhabitants of some African village. Similarly,different topics will come up depending on whether we are at the breakfast table,in a restaurant, in a streetcar, in court, or in a linguistics class. We talk aboutdifferent things with friends or with strangers, with a doctor or with a policeman,with children or adults, with men or with women.This is all rather obvious. But, strangely enough, there is a lack of systematicresearch in linguistics, sociology, or anthropology into these topic sets. We have, ofcourse, sound intuitions about the kinds of topics that may be raised during a partyor a conversation with a stranger on the bus, but very little is known about theconstraints and rules for choosing, introducing, maintaining, and changing a topic,for depth of detail, length, and so on. In classical poetics and rhetorics there hasbeen some attention to the study of loci communes, that is, stereotypical topic, orthemes, both in literature and in public speech topic analysis Toposforschungof Curtius, 1948. Also, we know that there are many themesboth general onesdeath, love, etc. and particular ones Faust, Don Juanthat occur through theliterature of a given culture, but little is known about our everyday topics in varioussituations with various persons. It is a stereotype that certain men will, in informalsituations, preferably talk about women, sports cars, business, tax deductions,and so on. It is also well known that each culture has topical taboos Sex hasbeen the major one in our culture at least for situations with relative strangers.As discourse is essentially and constitutively part of sociocultural interactions,it will manifest the distribution, variation, and constraints on attention, interests,goals, or styles of such encounters in the form of different topic sets. For ourdiscussion this means that language users can make hypotheses about what will ormay be said by whom in what situation, at least globally speaking, that is, at thelevel of macrostructures. These constraints are so strong that we are seldom completely surprised by the topics chosen in particular situations. And if a stranger on abus suddenly starts to tell about his or her sex life, or income tax problems, we willusually feel highly uncomfortable If talk is possible at all in such a situation, then itwill be limited first of all to topics related to the bus ride, then perhaps to stereotypical issues weather, important events a murder in the town, or other public issues,198and only lastly will it extend to personal topicsprimarily actual behavior andappearance. Hence, it seems from this example that the topic set is ordered Therewill be a hierarchy defined in terms of topic likelihood or acceptability. Thisprobability measure affects our expectations of topics for a specific discourse ordiscourse fragment, and hence the confidence with which a macroproposition isderived hypothetically even before the discourse or the discourse fragment hasbegun.The strategies or strategy steps based on the various types of information thatwe have informally discussed can be called contextual see also Chapter 3. That is,even without particular information from the discourse itself, language users establish at least topic sets for each communicative situationtopic sets that are progressively constrained by the culture, the social situation, the specific cummunicative event or speech act, the various social dimensions roles, positions, statussex, age, etc. of the speaker, and, finally, the personal characteristics goals,interests, plans, personality, etc. of the speaker.Whereas we have a more or less clear picture of the kinds of informationhandled by contextual macrostrategies, we still lack insight into their precise forms,order, and other cognitive constraints. Although we cannot go into it here, it isobvious that the selection of possible topics of discourse in the widest sense dependson the organization of our cultural knowledge. Similarly, we probably do not havereadymade lists for topics on the bus, at a party, or at the breakfast table, becausethe length and the number of such lists would make practical, and hence strategical,use impossible for most situations. Nor is it clear how we know that some topicis not acceptable for a given communicative situation. A negative list does notseem a sound possibility either, although we may have a rather short list oftaboos for certain types of situations.As a basis for contextual rnacrostrategies we therefore should start at a somewhat more specific level, namely, at the level of the sociocultural and communicative situation. These situations are fairly well defined by type of social context,possible interactions, kinds of agents, and by place or set of objects. The most likelytopics for those situations, then, will be those pertaining to the typical events andinteractions of such situations. In some cases, such topics are obligatory In class, incourt, or when visiting a doctor we have to say certain things and will usually not beallowed to say others. Givng a talk or giving testimony inherently constrains thepossible topic sets for such situations. Besides the typical objects or events whichmay characterize these situations and which therefore become possible topics,the goals, interests, opinions, or attitudes of the participants will indicate whatthe particular range of topics should be.In light of the preceding remarks, we shall now try to systematize the variouspieces of contextual information used to derive possible topics or topic sets fordiscourse or discourse fragment in Table 6. l . This list will be more or less ordered,but depending on the communicative context, a language user may simply skip themost general cultural levels. The information categorized in Table 6.1 determinesthe possible or impossible topics of speakers. In order to understand a discourse, a199Table 6.1Contextual Information for Macrostrategies1.

Actual referential context presence of persons, objectshearer or reader must represent such speakeroriented contexts or situations,either on the basis of general knowledgeas in 1 and 2or on the basis ofactual contextual analysisas in 3. If speaker and hearer do not share knowledgeabout the various categories, partial comprehension may be the result. At theglobal level this means that although individual sentences may be understood,the hearer may fail to grasp what the discourse as a whole is about Without thegeneral, higher level Subsuming concepts, no macroproposition may be formed,and the same holds if some presupposed sociocultural event, action, or situationis presupposed by the speaker but is unknown to the hearer.6.3.2. Strategies for Topic IntroductionThe idea underlying the information specified in Table 6.1 is that discoursesand their topics do not come out of the blue. Language users must be assumed to becontinuously active as social members and as persons in the global and localinterpretation of their environment. They apply categories to the situations andinteractions they witness or are participating in. Discourses, thus, are primarily seenas functional parts of the communicative, and more general social and cultural,goals of groups and individuals. The topics chosen for such discourses will reflectthis functional role both semantically and pragmatically. It is not necessary for alanguage user to go through the whole list of information for each discourse, or tomake complex searches through culturally or socially determined knowledge andbeliefs At the moment of speaking or hearing the language understander willusually possess some representation of the global and local context. In the bank we200do not start to construct a context only after the teller has addressed us. We alreadyknow we are in the institution of a bank, where we can or should perform such andsuch actions, that certain categories of people are present, and that the interactionsmay follow some stereotypical script e.g., cashing a check. The question May Isee some identification, please in that case will not be unexpected at all, but willbe partly predictable from the general situation and the script, as well as fromprevious actions if we already have shown some identification, we no longerexpect this topic to come up again. Thus, the language user as a social member willin general already have a partial representation of the structures mentioned in 1and 2 of Table 6. I , and sometimes also part of 3, especially if 3 involvescommunicative interactions which are stereotypical interactions of a given sociocultural context going to the bank.There may be varying degrees of freedom or boundedness for topic sets.Informal, familiar, private, and noninstitutional discourses, for instance, conversations and letters among friends, are practically free Any speaker may introduce anytopic when respecting the local coherence of the conversation topic change rules.On the other hand, topics in the classroom, in court, at the doctors, or in churchare much more bound, or even completely fixed.Topic introduction is subject to two kinds of constraints. First, the topics maybe determined by the sociocultural situation and communicative context of interacting speaker and hearer, as in the examples that have been given. The other constraint comes from the medium and discourse type involved Stories, news stories inthe press or on television, or novels may be about many things, but the generalconstraint is that the events reported must be interesting to the audience of thediscourse.Thus, the extremely rich contextual information to be processed for possibletopics in a situation is now reduced to a manageable size The hearer already has arepresentation in episodic memory of the context, and only has to specify what theinteraction goals and therefore the most likely communicative goals are. Fromthere, he or she may make educated guesses about the most likely speech acts, andhence about the global topics, as well as about the specific discourse types. Hierarchically dominant will be those topics that are interactionally bound, and thereferential freedom, within a given interaction or speech act type, will be furtherconstrained by beliefs about the speakers interests or the speakers beliefs aboutthe hearers interests, the degree of familiarity or intimacy, or recent actions orevents.Although these considerations properly belong to a sociology or social psychology of discourse, a cognitive theory of discourse understanding must incorporate a model of language users within the sociocultural and communicative situation, from which interactional and referential constraints can be derived for possibletopic sets. The strategies we have informally discussed may now be summarizedas followsContextual Macrostrategy I GENERAL CONTEXT DEPENDENCELimit semantic searches to the general cultural context of the speaker.201Contextual Macrostrategy II ACTUAL SITUATION DEPENDENCELimit topic search to the general properties of the actual situation.Contextual Macrostrategy III INTERACTION DEPENDENCEDecide which topics are directly functional for the actualization of theinteractional and pragmatic goals of the speaker.Contextual Macrostrategy IV DISCOURSE TYPEDecide which topics are characteristic for the discourse types expected inthis interactional context.Contextual Macrostrategy V REFERENTIAL FREEDOMGiven IIV, decide what objects or events can be talked about by whom in agiven speech act and discourse type.These strategies have been formulated in a very general way. Details were givenearlier, as well as some examples of the determinacies and constraints involved.Perhaps Strategy V is superfluous, as it seems to follow from IVI. However, it ismeant to specify those possible topics that are not yet specified by the previousstrategies. Thus, Strategy V will limit the possible choice of topics in aneveryday conversation, for example, or in a story, depending on the social andpersonal characteristics of the speaker or the speakerhearer relationship.The contextual strategies do not operate alone. They have been discussedmerely to show that discourse and hence discourse topics depend to a largeextent on the properties of the global or local context. It will be the discourseitself that supplies the ultimate decision about the actual topics, and hence alsoabout the necessary match between text and context.6.4. TEXTUAL MACROSTRATEGIESWhereas the contextual macrostrategies set up anticipatory expectationsabout possible discourse topics, the various properties of the text itself providethe definite decisions about the actual topic. Of course, contextual and textualstrategies go hand in hand. If a contextual strategy determines a very specifictopic, as in highly stereotypical situations, the textual strategies will have a mucheasier task. This dependence may even be so strong that if text and context donot topically match, the hearer may misunderstand the actualized topic of thediscourse.6.4.1. Structural SignalsIn order to understand the textual strategies of language users in setting up atopic, both in production and in comprehension, we should recall the nature ofsemantic macrostructures. These consist of fairly high level macropropositionsderived from propositions expressed in the text together with information fromworld knowledge. In principle, therefore, macropropositions need not show directlyin the surface structure of the text, but must be inferred from semantic interpreta202tions of words, phrases, clauses, sentences, or sentence sequences. The majorstrategy must be a form of semantic inference. Yet, to facilitate such inferencediscourse usually signals intended macrostructures. As language users will bring tobear different sets of knowledge, beliefs, etc., on the interpretation, it is likely thatdifferent macrostructures may be derived. In order to constrain this kind of personalvariation in interpretation, speakers use devices to limit the possible global interpretations. One obvious way is to explicitly tell in the discourse itself what themain topics are, that is, by expressing the macropropositions. Such expressions,which we will call topical or thematic, may occur at various locations of thediscourse, but preferably at the beginning or end of the text as a whole or at thebeginning or end of the relevant episodes or paragraphs.Topical expressions have specific surface structures Not only will they typicallyprecede or follow a discourse, or occur at the beginning or end o paragraphs, butthey are also expressed in independent sentences, or signaled by larger print,italics, bold type, and are separated from other expressions by pauses or blanks.Highlighting topical sentences can be very effective For instance, children whowere unable to use topic sentences efficiently in finding titles for a paragraph werehelped substantially when the topic sentence was graphically highlighted Williams,Taylor,  Canger, 1981. Topical expressions may have various lengths, rangingfrom a sequence of sentences to individual sentences, clauses, phrases, or words.Thus, an initial summary e.g., the lead in a newspaper story or a final summarywill typically consist of a sequence of sentences, whereas titles will consist of oneclause or phrase, and captions of one phrase or one word. Finally, even withinnontopical sentences topical expressions, such as key words, are used in order tohelp the reader infer macropropositions for previous or coming discourse segments.The initial or final position of topical expressions follows from their semanticfunctions. At the beginning they help the hearer to form a hypothesis about the topicof the discourse or the episode, so that the following sentences can be interpretedtop down relative to that macroproposition, whereas in the final position, topicalexpressions serve to check, remind, or correct the already established macropropositions of the hearer, as well as to repeat what was already known, so that thehearer has not only hierarchically dominant information but also recentinformation to search for when the topic is needed in subsequent tasks.There are differences between unplanned spoken discourse and planned writtendiscourse as far as use of topical expressions. Whereas written discourse forms willvery often have titles and subtitles, spoken discourse will have recourse to variousforms of topical announcements e.g., Jefferson, 1978 Quasthoff, 1980 Did Itell you that story about . . . Did you know that . . . . Also, spoken discoursemay use intonation and stress to underline important or prominent concepts. Furthermore, the communicative situation will be less ambiguous due to the richcontextual information, such as gestures and other paratextual signals, as well as abetter mutual understanding of the communicative situation. Finally, topics in spoken discourse, especially in unplanned conversation, have less complexity and are203generally shorter than in written discourse, so that there will be less doubt aboutwhat the actual topic is. Longer forms of spoken discourse, especially the monological types such as lectures or public address, will tend to have properties ofwritten discourse preannounced titles, summaries, and so on.The kinds of expressions discussed here do not always express full macropropositions, let alone full macrostructures. In general, only summaries willexpress macrostructures, whereas titles sometimes express only the top macroproposition. Other expressions may only refer to major concepts in the macropropositions, as is the case with captions in news stories. In that case, the result ofthe strategy is not a macroproposition, but only a fragment thereof, or at least a hintfor the actualization of relevant knowledge. Topical expressions, indeed, have adouble function in this respect. On the one hand they provide concepts that mayconstitute macropropositions, and on the other hand they are the input for knowledge use strategies see Chapter 9 They activate domains of knowledge, framesor scripts necessary to understand subsequent sentences and to apply macrorules.6.4.2. Syntactic StrategiesSyntactic signaling is mainly used to indicate local importance and works onlysecondarily to indicate global importance. Thus, topiccomment or focus assignment to sentence structure is not so much an indication of global importance orrelevance as it is a rulegoverned means of connecting and distributing informationbetween the sentences of a discourse. Just as with phonetic stress distribution,signaling is often based on contrast. Cleft sentence structure in particular is apreferred syntactic means of drawing attention to nonnormal and hence locallyimportant information. Topicalization and passive structure may be used for asimilar purpose. Another natural way to foreground information is provided by theclausal structure of sentences, especially by the distinction between superordinateand subordinate sentences. However, hierarchical sentence structure also serves toindicate information distribution, like the other syntactic means discussed. In general, first clauses are presupposed, whether subordinate or superordinate. This tendsto assign more importance to the final, asserted clause. However, one cannot simplyidentify importance with newness, that is, with assertion or focus. If the normalrule, the rule defining canonical preferred structures, is that new or focused information in English comes in final, stressed position, then deviations from this rulemay be used to mark contrast, and hence breaches of expectations, indicatinglocal relevance.Basically, these functions are local ones, however. Syntactic structures mayindicate global, thematic importance only indirectly, via cumulative inference. IfJohn plays a prominent role syntactically in several sentences, for example, ifJohn regularly occurs as the sentence subject and in topic position, then he mayalso be a sequential topic, which may lead to the strategic hypothesis that he isthe main character for the text as a whole, hence an agent in the macroproposition.2046.4.3. Topic Change MarkersTopical expressions pertain both to macrostructures for the discourse as awhole and to topically coherent parts of discourse, socalled episodes. An episode isa sequence of sentences dominated by a macroproposition. A number of authorshave used the episode concept, or similar ones such as paragraph, both inlinguistics e.g., Longacre, 1979 Hinds, 1979 van Dijk, 1982b and in psychologyBlack  Bower, 1980 Haberlandt, Berian,  Sandson, 1980. Episodes may bemarked in different ways. A wellknown surface structure mark is paragraph indentation, or a pause in spoken discourse. Besides these surface structure signals, anepisode will often be introduced in semantically conspicuous ways. Since by definition each episode is subsumed by a different macroproposition, we may expertdifferent agents, places, times, objects, or possible worlds to be introduced at thebeginning of an episode. Thus, one way to signal topics in a discourse is to signaltopic change, namely, the transition from one topic to another in different episodes.Examples of topic change markers at the beginning of new episodes are1. Change of possible world X dreamt, pretended, . . . that . . .2. Change of time or period The next day, . . . Thefollowing year3. Change of place In the meantime in Amsterdam, . . .4. Introduction of new participants5. Full noun phrase reintroduction of old participants6. Change of perspective or point of view7. Different predicate range change of frame or scriptThe general strategy, thus, is that if some sentence no longer can be subsumedunder a current macroproposition, a new macroproposition will be set up, ofwhich the change markers are the respective partial expressions.Macropropositions as exhibited in the different episodes of a discourse mustalso be properly connected, just as propositions expressed by sentences are connected. This means that their connections may be directly expressed, for example,by connectives, by conjunctions, or adverbs. In addition to the list of episodemarkers given here we characteristically find macroconnectives such as sentenceinitial but, however, on the contrary, moreover, etc. at the beginning of episodes.Not only do macroconnectives signal new macropropositions, they also assign thenecessary coherence structure to the macrostructure as a whole. This structure maybe the usual conditional one cause, consequences, or it may be functional aswell. Subsequent episodes may give a specification, an example, a contrast, etc.,of the previous episode. In that case they will be hierarchically subordinate to theprevious episode.6.4.4. Semantic StrategiesWith the discussion of topic change markers which may be used to set up newmacropropositions, we have already introduced a number of purely semantic strat205egies for macrostructure inference. Whereas rnacropropositions may be directlyexpressed, they can be properly inferred only from underlying semantic representations. Hence, it is the meaning of words, phrases, and sentences that will providethe major cues for the derivation of topics.Given the specific monitoring role of macropropositions, we must assume thatlanguage users will try to derive the relevant macroproposition of a passage as soonas possiblethough they may not always be able to do so, as we shall show inSection 7 of this chapter. If possible, they will not wait until they have alreadyunderstood, locally, a full sequence of sentences, but start to make macrohypothcases as soon as one sentence, or even one clause, has been interpreted. In somecases, partial macrointerpretation may even occur after one phrase. If a story startswith the sentence John . . . . , it may be provisionally assumed that the story willbe about John, so that we already have one participant for the macroproposition.Yet, a full macropropositionthat is, a topic or theme in our termscan be derivedonly with a clause expressing a proposition, so that possible world, time, place, andkind of predicate action, event, or other participantsand participant rolesareknown. If initial clauses or sentences are relatively general, they may be provisionally taken as topical, in the sense discussed earlier. At the other extreme are thoseinitial sentences that merely express one, relatively unimportant, detail of a sequence, such as It was a beautiful day. In between are initial sentences that at leastintroduce participants, time, and place, where the predicate concept will give afirst idea about the kind of state, action, or event involved, and hence also aboutthe more global state, action, or event concept that might figure in themacroproposition1 John wondered where he would spend his holidays that year.2 Mary hadnt seen her grandma for a long time now.3 Listen, Harry, are you free tonightFrom such initial sentences much information can already be inferred about possibletopics for the discourse. Not only may predicates be interpreted as states, actions, orevents to be subsumed under more general ones, but also our world knowledge tellsus which of these states, actions, or events are typical motivations or conditions forothers. Finally, various circumstantials of the first sentence or first clause willprovide cues for the establishment of the possible world, time, and place categoriesof a macroproposition.The various macrohypotheses thus derived from the semantic structure of thefirst clause or sentence must be confirmed by the interpretation of subsequentclauses and sentences. According to the strategies for local coherence establishment, a fast check will be made about the assumed sameness of place, time, andparticipants. In case of coreferential identity we have a first confirmation of themacrosttuctural relevance of these categories. For the interpretation of a predicate inthe next sentence, a strategy will establish whether this next predicate can besubsumed under the same more global predicate tentatively inferred from the predicate in the previous sentence, as in going on a holiday in 1 or going out in 3.206If no predicate can be derived yet, the two predicates together may yield enoughinformation for the derivation of a macropredicate in the second sentence, suchas going to the beach in the following sequence4 It was a hot day today. They hadnt been to the beach for a long time. . .If the sequence of sentences that cannot be subsumed under a tentative macroproposition grows longer, the hearer or reader might have problems. Only localcoherence may hold in that case, but no monitoring macroproposition will bethere to relate the respective propositions at a higher level. Strictly speaking, thiswill result in partial interpretations, and the language user will then resort to awaitandsee strategy As soon as a sentence is interpreted which provides cuesfor a topic, the partially interpreted proposition sequence may be retrieved orpost hocassigned a macrostructural role.It is obvious that in any case the function of organized world knowledge iscrucial in the inference of macropropositions. If states, actions, or events arementioned that are part of a knowledge frame or script, it will be easy to derive amacroproposition by instantiating the general proposition covering the script orpart of the script. But also more general knowledge, as we suggested earlier,about conditional relations between events, actions, or states of affairs, will bedrawn from world knowledge in order to derive expectations about what kind ofinformation may subsume the sequence as a whole.6.4.5. Schematic StrategiesFinally, besides the surface structural and semantic information discussed sofar, schematic or superstructural information may strategically help thederivation of macropropositions. This is because, first of all, many schematicstructures, such as those of a narrative, have a normal or canonical ordering, andsecond, because the schematic categories have global semantic constraints. If,indeed, the beginning of a story is schematically organized by a setting, forexample, we also know that the first macropropositions may denote a statedescription, introducing participants, place and time specifications, andbackgrounds or motivations for the event, or actions that follow. In the nextchapter we will study in more detail this link between semantic and schematicglobal strategies.6.5. MACROSTRATEGIES IN ACTIONSOME EXAMPLESIn order to make the theory of macrostrategies more concrete we shall examinea number of examples here. We shall return, of course, to our news report onGuatemala and provide a detailed analysis of its macrostructure. However, we alsowant to consider some rather different types of texts. First, we shall analyze the207beginnings of some literary texts, to show how macrostrategies operate on thebasis of the semantic content of the first few sentences in these stories. Finally,after turning to our Newsweek text we shall discuss a quite different example,namely, a conversation, where the communicative and pragmatic context must bereconstructed from the situation.6.5.1. Literary DiscourseOur first examples are drawn from an anthology of short stories Pickering 19785 Sunlight on his face woke him, but made him shut his eyes again it streamedunhindered down the slope, collected itself into rivulets, attracted swarms offlies, which flew low over his ,forehead, circled, sought to land, and wereovertaken by fresh swarms.

A possible macroproposition which could be inferred from the first sentence therefore is not yet confirmed by the next sentences. In 6 we have aflashback to the previous day instead of a description of the getting up in themorning script.Thus, in 5 the story starts with an environmental description sunlight andflies. By Macrorule 1 deletion, such descriptions, if not directly functional for therest of the story, will be deleted. Important is only the fact that somebody woke up208and that he discovers that he is bound by a rope. It is therefore doubtful whether amacroproposition, except He woke up, is being formed for the beginning of 5.At most we might also have He was bothered by flies. That proposition may bemore or less functional with respect to the fact that the person discovers that he isbound, namely, by being unable to chase away the flies. Only the proposition thathe was bound is out of the normal and hence interesting, and it will therefore betaken as a provisional macroproposition probably presignaled already by the title ofthe story The Bound Man. And, indeed, the following sentence starts to give adescription of the way he was bound by a rope. We discover that besides thestrategy of finding an interesting macroproposition that would subsume subsequentpropositions, we have a strategy that directly deletes information from the macrostructure, under the assumption that this will probably just be descriptive detail ofthe circumstances. If necessary, such information may later be retrieved in case itappears to be more relevant than was originally assumed by the reader e.g., ifthe rest of the story is about flies.In 6 we have a typical change of scene, namely an explanation of how wegot to the city in the East, which by Macrorule 3 construction can be taken as anormal condition for being in the city now, which is again a circumstance description of the place of subsequent actions. Such a macroproposition may be used as anormal part of the complex macroproposition under the category of location. Then,an idea is given of the reasons for coming to the city the horse races. And finallyfrom the first noun phrase of the first sentence, being a subject and expressing anagent, the expression we introduces the possible agent for the macropropositionspecified in a later sentence with at least one participant Hanley Turner in thisgroup, and a possible coparticipant a nigger introduced with an indefinite description in object patient position. From these two examples we see that inliterary prose we sometimes need to apply a waitandsee strategy before we areable to derive a strategically useful macroproposition Environmental description,explanations, or backgrounds may come first, possibly with the introduction of atleast one macroparticipant.In 7 the initial scene starts with the beginning of a going out script, in whichtwo women and a central participant I are being introduced. Since the plans ofthe participants are explicitly expressed, we may assume that propositions such as Iam going out with a film director or Ill have my bachelors night can be derivedas topics, as well as She my friend is going out as a parallel topic. It cannot yetbe decided which of these themes will dominate the rest of the story. This meansthat in addition to what we have assumed earlier, the beginning of a story may giverise to alternative or parallel macropropositions, which later can be confirmed ornot.Example 8 is more troublesome. The abstractness of the description as hardlyallows the derivation of a macroproposition We have no idea what the passagecould be about. This is typical for literary prose and poetry, and it will turn outlater that this description is about the act of writing itself. In that case, the laterinformation should provide the theme so that earlier information can be picked up us209one aspect of the theme, for example, that it is difficult, or unsatisfactory. Maybewe have, instead of a precise initial macropositian, just some emotional impression,possibly categorizable under such concepts as difficult action.6.5.2. A Macroanalysis of the Newsweek TextThe role of macrostructure formation for news discourse is absolutely crucial,more so than for stories which we read for our entertainment or for conversations towhich we turn in the next section. The general communicative function of news isto create or update situation models We want to know new things about situationsabout which we have heard or read before, or about new situations, often linkedwith or similar to previous ones. The news input, however, is vast, and we needto select Macrostructure formation is the primary mechanism enabling us to do so.Newspaper discourse is organized in such a way that it presents powerful cuesto the reader for the inference of macro structures Headlines, initial position, boldprint, lead or initial thematic sentencesall express the macrostructures of the text,as intended by the journalist. Of course, each reader may apply his or her ownstrategies of macrostructure formation and the resultant macrostructure may berather different from the one expressed in the headlines or leads of the newspapertext. But this will presuppose specific knowledge, interests, and goals. The averagenewspaper reader will for the majority of news articles just follow the cues aspresented by the text.Our Newsweek text see front endpapers exhibits some of the features mentioned above. It has a headline Guatemala No Choices, and a metaphorical initialposition thematic sentence, followed by a highlevel first paragraph describing thegeneral political situation in Guatemala as compared to that in El Salvador. We mayassume that the reader knows the general schema of news discourse to which wewill turn in the next chapter and constructs his or her first macropropositions onthe basis of these cues title, initial position sentence, and first paragraph. These,therefore, are expected to present the most important, summarizing information,which will be specified progressively in the body of the article.Headlines or titles, as in our example, present some information about therelevant macrostructure, but this information will often be partial or vague. In ourtext, the reader may safely infer that the text will be about Guatemala, and thereforethat Guatemala will be the major discourse referent of the text. However, theexpression no choice is vague, and would lead only to a macropredicate such asthere is a problem in G, or there is a predicament. We have seen that the firstsentence of the text does not yield very much more than the overall interpretationthat Guatemala is compared with El Salvador, and that the political situation inGuatemala is a black and white one. This calls for specification in moreconcrete political terms, and these are indeed provided in the next sentences.In addition to these textual cues, many readers will also have an existing modelabout the political situation in Guatemala which will play a role in the process ofmacrostructure fortnation. The readers opinions, beliefs, and ideology are also210relevant, and we shall point to their effects, even though we cannot model theseaspects of the comprehension process explicitly.In Table 6.2 we have outlined a plausible processing sequence illustrating thestrategic derivation of the macrostructure for the Newsweek text, starting with therather vague macroproposition from the headline of the article and from preknowledge about the situation. In the first column we present the expressed proposition,as constructed by the local interpretation processes. These constitute the input to themacrostrategies. In Column A we list possible higher level macropropositions. Notethat the macroproposition does not always change when a new text proposition isformed The text may simply be confirming the existing macroproposition e.g., thesame macroproposition dominates S12S15. Topic changes result in new provisional macropropositions. Apart from the local meaning of words and sentences,the reader will also use other information in the text to infer a topic change, such asparagraph boundaries, subtitles, or any changes in place, time, participants, ortype of action.Macropropositions, just like any other kind of propositions, are organizedschematically. Hence, the reader will inspect the text cues and the local semanticsin order to find the major possible categories for a macroschema, such as themacropredicate, the respective macroparticipants, and the time or location of thewhole macroevent.Similarly, macropropositions once formed need to be linked coherently, justlike the local textbase. Hence, functional and conditional relations among macropropositions must be established, yielding a specific macrotext level, that is, asequence of macropropositions of the same level of generality. This level may againbe the input for the application of further macrorules, and produce a still higherlevel, and so on until the general topic of the text is derived. In Table 6.3 wetherefore apply the macrostrategies again on the information yielded by themacrostructure obtained from the firstlevel strategies described in Table 6.2.In order to know which information does need a place in a macropropositionschema, the reader must apply strategic macrooperations. In our text, for instancethe reader must decide that the reference to Brazil, France, South Korea, or Romania is irrelevant at a higher level, and that this information can simply be reducedto arms from several countrieswhich is precisely one of the macrostrategiesnamely, generalization. Similarly, the reader will have to decide on line whichinformation is probably subsidiary and not a likely candidate for being taken up in amacroproposition, so that deletion becomes possible. For instance, it seems irrelevant that the rightwingers in Guatemala hired marimba bands and set off firecrackers on the night Reagan was elected. Such information may be deleted rightaway, or be taken as an instance of a scriptlike, culturespecific way of showinghappiness, which is a relevant aspect of the theme of the text They welcomed theelection of Reagan, at least at first. We see that, although macrostrategies useoperations similar to the formal macrorules, they do so only provisionally, and with alimited and variable input, both from the text and from general world knowledgeIt is this world knowledgeabout politics, news, Newsweek, and the situation in211Table 6.2Macrostrategies in the Comprehension of the Newsweek TextPropositional inputasexpressed byProvisionalmacrooperationA.

In Table 6.1 we therefore need a further column3 specifying at least a tragment of this general knowledge, the kind of frames andscripts involved, or the stereotypical scenes that may occur in many scripts, suchas the MOPs discussed by Schank 1979b.Macropropositions ultimately organize sequences of propositions of the textbase in episodic memory. Such sequences we have called episodes van Dijk1982b. Often, they are signaled in surface structure by paragraph indentation inwritten discourse, or pauses in spoken discourse, as well as by the subheadings wementioned earlier, or the change, at the semantic level, of participants, places, time,or type of action. Also, new episodes may be signaled by specific grammaticalwords, such as still in S,a of our text, by full definite expressions instead ofpronouns see MarslenWilson et al., 1982, or nominalizations of previous macropropositions, such as the wholesale killing in S33 of our text.In Table 6.4 we present summaries expressing the three levels of the macroTable 6.4Possible Summaries for Newsweek Text1. Long summary. Because the political situation in Guatemala is more extreme than in ElSalvador, there are no political choices. There are unorganized groups of communists on the left, andon the right is an elite helped to power by the U.S. Unlike the situation in El Salvador, thepolitical center has been murdered in Guatemala. Although the regime first had welcomedReagans election and had Counted on aid from his administration, they are now disappointedbecause of the continuing U.S. demands for political moderation. Therefore the U.S. has littleinfluence in Guatemala and the Guatemalan regime frustrates U.S. diplomacy. The regimewill fight the guerrillas without U.S. help, and has acquired arms from many countries, inparticular from Israel, adding to the U.S. military equipment they already have. The relationsbetween the U.S. and Guatemala are strained especially because of the mass murderscommitted by the Guatemalan regime. The actions of the regime, however. have not dauntedthe guerrilla groups, which have now joined forces and receive aid from communi1tcountries. There is no centrist solution in Guatemala, like the one that may be possible inEl Salvador. because the political center has been massacred by the regime, which, ofcourse, will help the guerrilla, Will the U.S. continue backing this kind of brutal regime2. Short summary second level. Since the political situation in Guatemala is moreextreme than m El Salvador, there are no political choices. On the left are communist guerrillas,and on the right an elite, backed by the U.S., whereas the political center has beenmurdered by the regime. The recent U .S demands for political moderation have been ignored and theregime frustrate, U.S. policy. They continue to fight the guerrillas on their own, committing massmurders. The guerrillas, backed by communist countries, fight back. Therefore, there does notseem to be a centrist solution like in El Salvador, but will the U.S. support a brutal regime3. Shortest higher level summary. In Guatemala there are no political choices. On the left arecommunist guerrillas, and on the right an elite regime, backed by the U.S., which has murdered itscentrist opponents. The regime, ignoring U.S. demands for moderation, continues on its own tofight the guerrillas who, however, resist successfully. A centrist solution is impossible.219structure derived in Tables 6.2 and 6.3. Obviously, these are not the only summariesthat could be derived from these textbases Any paraphrase would in principle beacceptable, with wide stylistic variations, though actual readers summarizing a textwould normally imitate the style of the original article.Similar remarks need to be made with respect to the macrostructure that wehave derived in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 This is only one possible macrostructure,derived from our analysis of the text with an objective attitude, that tries to betaithful to the intentions of the author. Quite different macrostructures and eventually summaries would result if a reader with strong political opinions subjectivelyinterprets the text e.g., imagine how ideologically committed readers, such asparticipants on the right or left in the Guatemalan civil war would summarizethis text.6.5.3. ConversationFinally, let us briefly examine an example of natural, spontaneous, everydayconversation. The fragment has been supplied for analysis by Schegloff 1979. Thefirst part of the conversation between two girls who have known each other for along time is about teachers they used to have at the same school before Bee wentto another school. Then, Bee starts to talk about a teacher she has now198 Bee nYeeah, hh This feller I havenn . iv elluh  this man.199 0.2 thhh He ha s uffehwhowho l have Jer200 linguistics is real lv too much. hh h201 Ava  Mm hm  y yYtm hm,202 Bee l didn notice it203 6t theres a xoman in mv class xhos a nurse n. hh she204 said to me .she .sd didju notice he has a handicar orr I205 said wha t. Youknovr I .said L dont see unrthing wrnn,206 I vi IM im, she .sars his ha nds.  207 Ava IM M.208 Bee  hhh So the ne.e class hh. hh Jer en hour en jeett 209rninutes I sat there en I vratched his ha nhds hh 210 hh hhhThis is just the beginning of the conversation, which continues about the way theteacher holds his fingers around the chalk and the fact that the woman in theclass has experience with handicapped people.Important for our observations is that this kind of story does not come fromnowhere. It is triggered by other thematic elements in the conversationhere, forinstance, the kind of experiences, teachers, classes, etc., the girls have or have hadin their schools. Under that general conversation topic, we may have a more localtopic, namely, a story about a particular teacher. This story is introduced with thefiller expression it Yeeah in Line 198, which marks, after the 0.2 pause, the con220tinuation of the same global conversation topic and which may also introduce a nextsubtopic. This subtopic is actually introduced with the reference to the major participant as an object for discussion of the story This feller, a term which is thencorrected to this man, perhaps because the story about him being handicappedrequires the more neutral concept of man as teller may be interpreted negatively.Another repair hastens to add that he is a linguistics teacher, which is a necessarydetail in the topic of the conversation as a whole type of classes and teachers arcusually given, before the story may mention the specific of this teacher Hehas. Then Bee opts for a more dramatic introduction of the main predicate ofthe story Instead of saying that he has handicapped hands, she traces back to thediscovery of the relevant facts I didn notice it bt theres u woman in my class . . .,introducing another participant the nurse in the story, and then a reporteddialogue with that woman about the hands of the teacher. For the hearer Ave thismeans that she has been able to establish a main participant for the macroproposition a linguistics teacher, and that there is something noticeable about him. Butonly in Line 204 is the central predicatenamely, that he has a handicapactuallyexpressed. Both for this embedded story and in the conversation as a whole, thisthematic predicate is interesting and therefore also marked in the reported conversation with extra stress. The interestingness is enhanced by the incredibility tag Isaid what and its motivation I dont see anything wrong upon which the nursein the reported dialogue finally introduces the topical item hands, also withparticular stress and a long vowel.From these few observations we see that in natural conversation a new topicmay be introduced a after a pause, b after specific boundary or linking signalsYeah, c by first introducing the major referent of the episode, and then d themajor predicate or other participants. Typically, all those topical elements aresignaled by heavy initial stress on first consonant or syllable or lengthenedvowels. Also, in stories, instead of telling what happened from the actual perspective, the storyteller may dramatize the events by relocating the perspective to thetime and place at which they occurred, by introducing the relevant topic in areported conversation, and by rhetorical devices, such as the incredibility tag,perhaps used to make the reported event more interesting while unbelievable.Together, these devices signal for the hearer that we have the following approximate macroproposition for this story We had a linguistics teacher with handicapped hands. Notice, also, that the story is organized in terms of narrative categories Clark, 1983. Thus, Lines 198199 function as a proper setting for the story,then from Line 302 onward we have the complication, and, finally, in Line 208 atransition to the resolution Bees seeing that the man is indeed handicapped andfrom Line 219 onward a segment not reproduced here an evaluation of the teacher,his handicap, and the consequences for the class theyre usually harder markersAs in this conversation we already have a partial macrostructure ready myteachers the fragment in question need not be oriented toward this general topicparticipant. Conversely, had the topic been handicapped people I know, then the221tact that it was a college teacher would become more prominent. Also, in ourexample the central predicate of the macroproposition is not announced but dramatically and rhetorically delayed to make the story more effective. Often, in everydaystories, the teller will first bring up the interesting topic of the story, so that otherspeakers will become interested and thus willing to yield the floor for some timenotice, too, that in our example Bee can continue at length, encouraged only byMmhhmmss of Ava, or a question concerning the major property of the topicalparticipantsWhy, whats the matter with his hands. Such announcements andfloor reservation strategies also have the important cognitive function of providing amacroproposition around which the details of the story can be organized fordetails see Jefferson, 1978.6.5.4. ConclusionsWhat conclusions can we draw from our analysis of the textual properties thatmay be used as devices in the strategic construction of macropropoaitions Although we have examined only three types of discourse, the general principle oftextually based comprehension strategies emerge fairly clearly1. At all levels, textual information and contextual information are closelyintertwined. The properties of the communicative context goals, speech acts,participants constrain the range of possible topics.2. The communicative context also constrains the possible discourse types,which are associated with sets of probable or possible topic.3. Many discourse types feature anticipatory or initial expressions of parts ofthe macrostructure, for example, in announcements, titles, summaries, orleads.4. Initial sentences sometimes have a thematic nature, expressing, either afirst macroproposition or settings, preparations, plans, or motivations whichare either fragments of such a macroproposition or a basis for their inferencefrom world knowledge e.g., by frames or scripts.5. Initial sentences feature propositions with participants, especially the mainagent, and sometimes time and location, that may be strategically taken asthose of the first macroproposition.6. In some discourse types, for example, artificial ,literary  or everyday stories, rhetorical devices may be used to delay the relevant categories of themacroproposition, such as its predicate, in order to arouse interest orsuspense.7. If no direct macroproposition can be strategically derived, macrorulese.g., deletion may be applied provisionally on the assumption that suchlocal propositions are irrelevant or only a component of the state, event, oraction occurring in the macrostructure.8. If no conclusion at all can be made on the basis of preliminary contextualor initial textual information, a waitandsee strategy is applied. The pro222cessed propositions may be reinstated from episodic memory to be used aselements for the derivation of a macroproposition signaled later in the text.9. Discourse types may be associated with stereotypical schematic structureswhich are associated with constraints on possible macropropositions, forexample, the setting of a story with introductory descriptions of location.time, circumstances, and above all the cast of discourse participants.If these principles are correct, a number of more specific conclusions may bedrawn for processing properties of different types of texts in different contexts. Ageneral prediction would, of course, be that if more of the contextual and textualsignals are available to the hearer or reader, comprehension will on the whole beeasier and hence faster. A second prediction is that local information strategicallySubsumed under a macroproposition can be retrieved, and hence recalled longer andbetter. Third, if during the comprehension of initial sentences a macropropositionmust be provisionally derived and, to do so, also relevant episodic and generalknowledge, the first sentence of a discourse will usually take longer to process thanfollowing sentences of the same length e.g., Den Uyl  van Oostendorp, 1980Haberlandt, Berian,  Sandson, 1980. This effect will obtain, in principle, foreach initial sentence of the various episodes of the text. Fourth, texts that havetopics that are unexpected for the given discourse type or communicative contextwill initially be more difficult to process because the relevant expectations andhence the macrostrategies are thwarted.6.6. EXPERIMENT 3 INTERESTAND LEVEL OFDESCRIPTION AS MACROSTRUCTURE CUES1Several experimental investigations of macrostrategies were mentioned inChapter 2, for example, studies involving titles, thematic sentences in initial position, and frequency of mentioning. We know that titles and subtitles may influencethe formation of macrostructures Schwarz  Flammer, 1981, among others, thatinitial sentences Lire often effective cues for rnacropropositions as, e.g., in Kieras,1980b, and that pre and postquestions and reminders can also play an importantrole for a summary of this work, see Ballstaedt, Mandl, Schnotz,  Tergan, 1981.Experiment 3 adds.two more demonstrations to this list It shows that the surprisingnessand hence interestingnessof an element contributes to the likelihood thatthis element will be perceived as macrorelevant, and that changes in the level ofdescription have the same effect.An interest strategy was first postulated by Schank 1979a. Everything elsebeing equal, an interesting item is more salient than an uninteresting one. Interest,1This etperirnent was performed by W. H. Walker. A full account can be found in W.H. Walker and W. Kintsch, Interest and elaboration as macrostrategies, TechnicalReport, University of Colorado 1981.223of course, may be based on many different factors. Interest is no more than acommon sense termthough a useful onewhich needs to be defined for technicalpurposes Kintsch, 1980a. Of the many possible sources of interest we have selected suprisingness here An otherwise uninteresting item can be made interestingby putting it into a surprising context. We predict, therefore. that if a text elementoccurs in a surprising context in a text, it will be rated as interesting and will belikely to be included in the macrostructure of the text, in preference tocomparable uninteresting elements.How shifts in the level of elaboration may signal macrorelevance has beendescribed above. The tendency to perceive elaborate material in a text as macrorelevant may simply be a special case of the Gricean conversational postulate to sayonly as much as necessary Grice, 1975. If one says more, this might mean that theelaborated item is destined to play some important role later on in the textsmacrostructure.An operational test of whether or not subjects perceive a text element asmacrorelevant was obtained by giving subjects incomplete texts and asking them forplausible continuations. Specifically, subjects did not have to complete the text infull detail, but had merely to say in a sentence or two how they thought the textcould plausibly continue. That is, subjects were asked, in effect, to complete themacrostructure of the text. If they used the critical text element in this completion.they thereby assigned macrorelevance to that element. If they did not use it, theypresumably did not think it was important enough for the text as a whole.In two different experiments we varied the surprisingness and the level ofdescription of a concept which appeared toward the end of a pagelong text fragment. Subjects then gave continuation responses.6.6.1. Method and MaterialsIn Experiment 3, 60 college students from the University of Colorado served assubjects. Six text fragments were written according to a 3 x 2 factorial design. Thefirst factor was condition, the second setting. The three experimental conditionswere the basic text, an elaborated version, and a surprising version. The basic textconsisted of a narrative about two boys walking around and encountering somesimple objects and events, including the target item. In the elaborated text the targetitem was described in some detail, whereas in the basic version it was merelymentioned by its name the two versions were otherwise identical. In the surprisingversion the target item appeared out of context, whereas in the basic and elaboratedversions it was appropriate to the story context.The texts were set either in the Rocky Mountains or in downtown Manhattan.In the Rocky Mountain texts, the two boys are hiking up a mountain and encountereither a mountain goat in the basic and elaborated version or a bus the surprise.In the City texts, the two boys come across a bus in the basic and elaborateversions or a mountain goat in the surprising version.224The texts were incomplete, stopping one sentence after the target item wasintroduced. Each subject received a booklet with one of the incomplete texts. Afterthey had read it, the narratives incompleteness was pointed out to them and theywere asked to complete it. They were told that we were interested in how well theycould predict the end of the story. They were to write down two or three sentencesindicating how they thought the story would continue. It was emphasized that theydid not actually have to complete the story, but merely indicate the gist of thecompletion. The subjects were not allowed to reread the text fragments at this point.After completing the story, each subject was asked to rate either the surprisingness or the interest value of the target item in the context of the story. Ten subjectsread and completed each fragment. Half rated the surprise value and half rated theinterest value of the targets. Ratings were done by marking a 7point scale, the endpoints of which were labeled quite interesting and quite uninteresting. Theselabels were further explained as As interesting boring as things in a little story likethis can be. Similarly, surprisingness was rated on a scale whose end points werequite surprising and quite unsurprising, with the explanation that this meantAs surprising predictable as things in a little story like this can be.6.6.2. ResultsTable 6.5 shows the results of this study. We see, first of all, that putting thetarget item into an inappropriate indeed, bizarre context had the desired effect Itmade it surprising F 2,24  25.47, p  .001 and it made it interesting F 2,24 6.69, p  .005. The elaborated and basic versions, on the other hand, did notdiffer significantly from each other in either surprisingness or interest.Making the target item surprising almost guaranteed that it would be includedin the continuations subjects wrote. Elaborating it also significantly increased thelikelihood that it would be perceived as macrorelevant, though in this experimentthe effect of the elaboration was less pronounced than that of surprisingness.These results were exactly as expected. A bus in the city and a goat on themountain were not very salient, but merely elaborating the descriptions of theseobjects somewhat made them appear macrorelevant. Putting the bus onto the mountain and the goat into the city made almost everyone think that the story must beabout them in some way.Table 6.5Surprisingness, Interest, and Macrorelevance in Experiment 3ABasictextElaboratedtextSurprisingtextSurprisingness rating 2.70 2.90 0.40Interest rating 3.40 3.60 5.90Probability of inclusion in continuation .35 .70 .952256.6.3. ReplicationAlthough the results of Experiment 3A are indisputable, it is not clear howgeneralizable they are as they are based on only three versions of two texts. Furthermore, our manipulation of surprisingness was as rather extreme. The experiment wastherefore replicated with new texts and somewhat more subtle, realistic manipulations The target items were embedded in a context that was unpredictable, butnot bizarre, and the degree of elaboration used was reduced from two additionalsentences to one.Otherwise, Experiment 313 was designed and run exactly like the previousexperiment. Another group of 60 subjects participated. The basic text consisted of astory about a young woman observing animals in a zoo. In the primate house sheeither sees a young chimpanzee in the basic and elaborated version or a smallleopard in the surprising version. These targets reverse their roles when thewoman visits the cat house.To use a chimp and a leopard as the target items proved to be a poor choice Itseems that everybody regarded them as so interesting that whether or not theyappeared in a predictable context made little difference. As Table 6.6 shows, theinterest ratings did not replicate the pattern of results obtained in the first experiment.The surprisingness ratings were as expected, though even in the inappropriatecontext the target items were not considered very unusual, and an analysis ofvariance did not yield a significant F value for these ratings. Although the ratingsthus were not sensitive enough to confirm our experimental manipulations as theyhad done in Experiment 3A, the continuation responses indicated that subjectsnevertheless were significantly more likely to include the target item in theircontinuations when it was elaborated or when it occurred in the less predictablecontex all p  .05.6.6.4. DiscussionThese experiments demonstrate that subjects do indeed employ an interest anda levelofdescription strategy in forming macrostructures. As our subjects had towork with relatively short and simple texts which provided an insufficient numberof alternatives for constructing a macrostructure, the target items were chosen withTable 6.6Surprisingness, Interest, and Macrorelevance in Experiment 3BBasictextElaboratedtextSurprisingtextSurprisingness rating 2.80 2.80 3.70Interest rating 4.70 3.10 4.20Probability of inclusion in continuation .35 .70 .95226relatively high probabilities even in the base condition by about a third of thesubjects in the first experiment, and by about a quarter in the second. Nevertheless.elaborating these target items in quite minor waysonly a few words describing abus are sufficientgreatly increased the chances that these items would be perceived as macrorelevant. Similarly, predictability in context played a role If a textelement is completely out of context, as in Experiment 3A, this is considered almosta sure sign for its global importance. But even when it is not terribly surprising butmerely somewhat unusual Experiment 3B it tends to be seen as macrorelevant. Wethus can add interest and levelofdescription to our list of macrostrategies that havebeen experimentally confirmed. We must point out, however, that as far as intereststrategies are concerned the present investigation is extremely limited We haveonly been concerned here with interest caused by surprisingness, that is, by contextually determined interest. Interest may have numerous other sources, ranging,from inherent interest of topics such as those discussed in books advising journalists on what makes news in our society, e.g., Gans, 1979 to interest generatedbecause one has already learned certain things about a topic and wants to knowmore Walker, 1981.It is worth noting as an aside that the interest strategy for macrostructureformation can sometimes produce surprising and quite undesirable results. Hidi,Baird, and Hildyard 1982 have shown that under certain conditions the practice ofincluding interesting bits and pieces of information in a text as educators are oftentold to do, in order to capture the attention of their pupils can backfire The excitinganecdote is strategically chosen for the macrostructure formation, and the points thatwere really important to the teacher are neglected. Similarly, in Kintsch andBates 1977 the jokes were the best remembered elements from a lecture on historygiven to a class of college students. It seems that one has to use some care inexploiting the interest strategy pedagogically It helps if important points in atext are interesting, but to include interesting but irrelevant detail in a text or in alecture may just confuse the macrostrategies.6.7. EXPERIMENT 4PRIMING MACROPROPOSITIONS2According to the model we have outlined here, the construction of a macrostructure is an integral component of text comprehension processes. Whenevercertain conditions are met, the macrostrategies become engaged and macropropositions are formed. Thus, in the canonical case, once text units such as a paragraphhave been read, the macropropositions for that text fragment are formed. Indeed,after a single reading of a paragraph on some familiar topic people can writereasonably accurate summary sentences. If a summary sentence is expressed in the2This experiment was performed by R. Guindon and is reported more fully in R.Guindon and W Kintsch, Priming macrostructures, Technical Report. University ofColorado. 1982.227paragraph, their inspection times, importance ratings, and thinking aloud protocols,how that they recognize it as such Kieras, 1980b Kieras  Bovair, 1981.Similarly, after reading a wellformed story just once, or listening to it, people areable to produce adequate summaries e.g., Kintsch  Kozminsky, 1977. However,in all these cases subjects are specifically asked to form summaries. What happens,though, in normal reading, when there are no explicit instructions to form summaries A less intrusive experimental method is required to answer that question.A procedure that suggests itself is the priming method of Ratcliff and McKoon1978. We have mentioned their work before Subjects read a few sentences andthen were given a yesno recognition test for some words from these sentences.Reaction times revealed a priming effect If two successive test words on therecognition test came from the same sentence, the reaction time to the second wordwas 110 msec faster than when the word was not preceded by a samesentenceword. Two words belonging to the same atomic proposition yielded an additional 20msec priming effect. The interpretation of this effect is that the sentence, as wellas the proposition, are effective memorial units The first member of a test pairaccesses and activates this unit, so that the second member can be processedmore rapidly.This methodology appears suitable to investigate macrostructures, too. According to our model, the macropropositions should form very strong memoryunits, and hence produce substantial priming effects. This priming effect should begreater than that observed for micropropositions, because macropropositions areformed and stored in memory with a greater probability than micropropoaitions,Hence, priming effects should be obtained for almost all subjects for macropropositions, but only some of the time for micropropositionsat other times the respective microunit would not be available in memory. Specifically, then, it we have aparagraph containing an explicit macrostatement, two words from that macrostatement should yield a larger priming effect than two words from elsewhere in the text.This hypothesis will be tested in what follows, together with the further hypothesisthat two words belonging to the microstructure of the text would produce a largerpriming effect if they came from the same sentence than if they did not, asobserved by Ratcliff and McKoon 1978.However, this result would only show that if a macrostatement is explicit in atext, subjects pick it out and assign it a special role, as they should. It could not tellus anything about the even more interesting case in which the macropropositionsmust be inferred from the text. The priming method can be applied for this purposetoo, however. If the macrostatement from the previous paragraph is deleted, subjects will presumably infer something like it. Hence, the test words from themacrostatement would be harder to reject on a recognition test than the otherdistractor words, leading to a higher false alarm rate as well as slower responsetimes. In order to show that this effect is indeed due to the macrostructure and notmerely to general similarity of the test words to the words in the original paragraph,two kinds of distractor words must be used words totally unrelated to the paragraphto yield a baseline, and words related to the paragraph but only to words that play a228Table 6.7Sample Text and Words for the Recognition TestTextExtra powerful shoulders that could give a decathloner an advantage in throwing the discus and shutcan slow him in the sprints and hurdles.

The latter should be harder to reject than unrelated controlwords because of general similarity effects the macrostructure words should heeven harder to reject, because they both are similar to the paragraph in general andplay a role in very accessible memory unitsthe macropropositions.Thus, an experiment was designed to evaluate these hypotheses. Table 6.7shows a sample text with its corresponding test items. In the explicit condition,subjects read this textand others like it, as will be described in what followsjustas it is shown here, and immediately afterward they were given a recognition testwith words from the paragraph as well as suitable distractor words. Neglecting forthe moment various filler items used for control purposes, the important test itemswere the ones labeled MACRO, MICROSAME, and MICRODIFFERENT inTable 6.7 In the first case, both the priming and the primed word belong to themacrostatement, which in this sample is the last sentence of the paragraph in thesecond case, the word pair belongs to another sentence which is part of the microstructure of the text in the third case, the word pair comes from different sentencesof the microstructure. If subjects treat the last sentence as an expression of theparagraphs macrostructure. MACRO words should be recognized faster and moreaccurately than MICROSAME words, recognition for which should in turn bebetter than for the MICRODIFFERENT words.Another group of subjects received the implicit version of the text shown inTable 6.7 the same paragraph without the macrostatement. Thus, these subjectshad not seen the MACRO word before, but had presumably interred it. Hence itshould be more difficult for them to respond no to the MACRO word than tothe UNRELATED and RELATED control wordsBoth the explicit and implicit conditions are tests of the hypothesis that macro229propositions are formed during reading, except that in one case a facilitatory effectis involved and in the other an inhibitory. Note that the test is nonintrusive Subjectsare merely given a recognition test, they are not concerned specifically with macrostructures, global relevance, or the like.In the experiment reported in what follows, we actually employed four groupsof subjects instead of just two as explained here. Essentially, we did the sameexperiment twice, except that the first time we made sure subjects formed macrostructures, whether they read the explicit or implicit versions. We asked them towrite a summary statement after reading each paragraph and before taking therecognition test. We did this to calibrate the experimental method How big are thevarious priming effects when we know that macrostructures have been formedThen we repeated the experiment, but this time subjects were not alerted to formmacrostructuresthey were merely given some paragraphs to read followed by arecognition test. If the subjects formed macrostructures they did it all on theirown. How do the priming effects compare in this spontaneous case with the onesobtained when we forced subjects to form macrostructures6.7.1. MethodFour groups of 16 students each served as subjects. The students were fulfillinga course requirement at the University of Colorado.Twelve texts were usedeight from Miller and Kintsch 192i0 and four fromKieras 1980a. The text shown in Table 6.7 was one of the 2. Texts wereapproximately 60120 words long. Each contained a summarizing statementeither at the beginning or at the end. This summarizing statement was deletedfrom the implicit version of the texts but present in the explicit versions.For each text, six pairs of test words were used. The first member of a pair wasalways the priming word and the second the. primed word. Reaction times and falsealarm rates to the primed words were the data of experimental interest. Five of theword pairs are illustrated with examples in Table 6.7 the sixth was u tiller pair,sometimes requiring a yes, sometimes a no response. All test words were contentwords. Syntactic class was matched within the different categories Primed wordswere equated within each text for word frequency, and equated for length overall paragraphs.A studytest recognition memory paradigm was used. Each subject receivedthree practice texts before the experimental texts. Tests were administered immediately after each text was read. The order of the 12 text, was randomized for eachsubject. The order of the test items was semirandorn, subject to certain constraintsto assure that the critical test items MACRO and the two MICROs in the explicitcondition MACRO, RELATED, and UNRELATED in the implicit conditionappeared in comparable positions and contexts.Texts were presented on a CRT screen under computer control. Reading timeswere selfpaced but limited. Summaries were written on a sheet of paper providedby the experimenter and were restricted to two lines in length. Recognition re230sponses were made by pressing YES and NO buttons, with instructions to respondas quickly and accurately as possible. Correct responses were followed by the nexttest word for incorrect responses, the word ERROR appeared briefly on the screen6.7.2. ResultsThe results of the experiment are shown in Table 6.8. The data shown in thistable are based on correct responses to the primed word only. Parallel analyses werealso performed for those cases in which the responses to both the primed andpriming word were correct. These analyses were identical in essential respects to theones reported here Correlating means over experimental conditions yields an r .994, with an average overall difference of 18 msec. No outlayers were excludedin Table 6.8, but data trimming did not change the results in notable ways.Hence, these supplementary analyses will be neglected here.Statistical tests on the data shown in Table 6.8 revealed that all adjacentreaction time means were significantly different, except the means for MICROSAME and MICRODIFFERENT, in both the explicit and implicit conditions. Thetests used were correlated ttests, exluding data points where one or both membersof a pair were missing. Furthermore, all adjacent proportions in Table 6.8 differsignificantly, as ascertained by chisquare tests. A 57c significance level wasused, throughout.Consider the, main question Did subjects behave differently when they wrotedown an explicit summary statement after reading and when they did notAs Table 6.8 shows, writing or not writing a summary sentence had almost noeffect on the data. The means in the table correlate r  .955, with a differencebetween the grand means of a mere 5 msec. We can safely conclude that whateversubjects were doing on the recognition tests, it was the same whether or not weforced them to form an explicit macrostructure.Strong and statistically significant macrostructure priming effects were obtained in both the explicit and implicit conditions. In the explicit condition, primedmacrowords were recognized 176 rnsec faster on the average than primed microwords. On the other hand, there was no evidence that microwords primed with aword from the same sentence were recognized any faster than microwords primedwith a word from a different sentence No significant differences were observedwith or without a written summary, and the overall difference averaged out toonly 3 msec.Miss rates mirror the reaction time data The miss rate for macrowords was3.5, but averaged 21 for microwords. Once again, the expected difference infavor of MICROSAME words did not materialize. Indeed, the miss rates forMICRODIFFERENT words were significantly lower in both conditions.Turning to the results of the subjects in the implicit condition who did not reada summary statement in the text but had to infer one, we again find strong evidencefor the importance of the macrostructure It is really hard to respond no to amacroword. About two thirds of the time the macroword is falsely recognized as231Table 6.8Recognition Latencies in Msec and False Alarm Rates for Different Classes ofPrimed Words as a Function of Experimental ConditionsWritten summary No written summaryMICROMICROMACRO SAME DIFFERENTMACROlatencyMisses rrlrnplicit8114MACRO91822RELATED96314UNRELATEDROS3MACROCorrect rejectionlatency 1399 1261 1044 1334False alarmFerccntaec 67 22 4 63Latency 1114 1421 1580 1075MICRO MICROSAME DIFFERENTE.vplic ifCorrect recognition232having been in the paragraph compared with a false alarm rate of 61 for unrelateddistractors, and even if it is rejected, a 340 msec average increase in responselatencies indicates just how hard it is to reject such items. That this effect was trulydue to the role of these items in the macrostructure and not to general similarityeffects is apparent if one considers the RELATED distractor items They are harderto reject than UNRELATED items an error rate of 24.5 versus 6 forunrelated distractors, and a priming effect of 218 msec, but not nearly as hard asmacroitems. Thus general similarity effects alone, although important, do notexplain all the effects observed with macrowords.Because of the high error rates in the implicit condition, it was possible toanalyze the response times for errors, that is, for incorrect acceptances. Thesemeans are shown in the last row of Table 6.8. Macrowords again play a specialrole They are accepted faster than words that are merely similar to some detailto the text, which in turn are accepted faster than unrelated words.6.7.3. DiscussionThe data presented here strongly support the idea that macrostructures areformed during reading, whether they are stated explicitly in the text or not, andwhether subjects are asked to do so or not. For these texts at least, macrostructureformation appeared to be an almost automatic process Readers formed macrostructures because their natural reading strategies led them to do so, not because theexperimental task required it in any way.The reaction time method used here proved to be a useful tool for investigatingthis process, both because it does not involve complex and strange instructions and,especially, because it is not intrusive. Macrostructures are investigated without thesubject being aware of it, minimizing potential distortions from experimentspecific strategies.Although the data are clear on the main points at issue here, our failure toreplicate Ratcliff and McKoons 1978 finding that greater priming effects areobtained within atomic propositions than between propositions needs some comment. There were many differences between these two experiments Our texts werelonger and much more complex, reaction times were considerably longer, and errorrates were much higher. In other words, the task was much more difficult here thanin the Ratcliff and McKoon study. Furthermore, the differences bewtween ourmaterials and those of Ratcliff and McKoon appear very substantial in retrospect, sothat our failure to replicate their results is perhaps not surprising. First of all, oursentences were often very long and complex. The priming and primed word did notalways form a close pair as in the example shown in Table 6.7. In one case, forinstance the sentence was When Eisenhower was Grand Marshall of the Tournament of Roses he was trapped in a bathroom at tournament headquarters by ajammed door and rescued just in time by a clerk. The priming word from thissentence was bathroom, with clerk as the primed word. It is perhaps not surprisingthat the priming effect in cases like this was no larger than for betweensentence233words. There were also some problems with a few of the primed words in theDIFFERENT condition, which turned out to be too closely related to the theme ofthe paragraph such as wind for a text on hanggliders, boots for a paragraph oncowboys. Indeed, if one does a post hoc analysis deleting those items that areobjectionable for one reason or another, the significant difference in the wrongdirection between the false alarm rates disappears, and a modest priming effect of67 msec for MICROSAME versus MICRODIFFERENT appears. Obviously,such an ad hoc analysis lacks force, but it leads us to question our data in thisrespect. Our necessarily more complex materials are not sufficiently comparableto the Ratcliff and McKoon study.The evidence we have presented here that people form macrostructures during,reading, whether or not the experimental instructions induce them to do so, providesstrong support for one of the main claims of our model that comprehension processes are global as well as local, that one guides the other, and that one cannot beunderstood while neglecting the other. We do not want to imply, however, thatwhat we have observed here will always be found in text comprehension. Theresurely are situations where for one reason or another local processing is minimal,indeed degenerate, while reasonably adequate macrostructures are being formede.g., the work on skimming newspaper reports, Masson, 1979. On the other hand,in situations where topdown processes are ineffective and the local decoding processes are extremely resource consuming, it is quite possible that understanding isonly, or primarily, local, at least on first reading which is what Schnotz, Ballstaedt,  Mandl, 1981, observed when their subjects were trying to summarize arather difficult essay. The reaction time method used here can probably be fruitfully employed to investigate further the interaction of local and global processes incomprehension. Easy and difficult texts, stories and essays, skimming and memorizing, need to be studied. And finally, the exact point in the text where macropropositions are formed should be determined.Chapter 7Schematic Strategies7.1. SUPERSTRUCTURESBoth in classical rhetorics or poetics and in current theories of discourse it hasbeen assumed that certain types of discourse exhibit conventional structures that gobeyond those usually accounted for in a grammar. Such structures may characterizeseveral levels of discourse. Well known, for instance, is the metrical organization ofphonological, graphical, and morphological structures, as accounted for in separatemetrical theories. In part, such structures are abstract and even language independent. Similarly, we may have rhetorical structures grafted onto the syntactic structures of sentences and sentence sequences or onto semantic structures, as inmetaphor, metonymia, irony, or other figures of speech.Such additional organizational patterns may also be relevant at the level of thediscourse as a whole. That is, certain parts of the discourse may have specificfunctions which are conventionalized in wellknown categories. Even in everyday,nontechnical language a discourse may have an introduction and a conclusion.Classical tragedy was thus partitioned into five acts, whose respective theatrical ornarrative functions were described as early as Aristotles Poetics. Rhetorics similarlymade distinctions between the parts of a public speech. Argumentational structures, as we know from classical logic dialectica, were distinguished in the theoryof the syllogism, namely, into different kinds of premises and a conclusion, distinctions which later were further refined in the philosophical theory of argumentationToulmin, 1958, and which in various forms reappear not only in everyday arguments, but also in scholarly discourse such as psychological articles Kintsch  van236Dijk, 1978. Perhaps best known, both in current theory of discourse and in psychology, are the narrative structures that characterize stories in our culture, namelythe categories of Setting, Complication, Resolution, Evaluation, and Coda Labov Waletsky, 1967, or variations thereof. The pioneering work on narrative structures was that of Propp 1968, with later developments due to Barthes 1966,Bremond 1973, van Dijk 1972, 1976, and others. This work is surveyed inGlich and Raible 1977 and van Dijk 1980c see also Chapter 2.Typical of all these structures is their schematic nature They consist of conventional categories, often hierarchically organized, that assign further structure tothe various levels of discourse. Sometimes the categories will only affect surfacestructures, as in metrical or prosodic patterns, but semantic or even pragmatic unitsare often schematically organized as well. As in all these cases the structures seemto go beyond the usual linguistic or grammatical organization of discourse, that is,to be somehow additional or grafted onto the linguistic structures, we call themsuperstructures. For stylistic reasons, sometimes we will also use the term schematicstructures, although the term schema is much more general, and is also used forlinguistic patterns or knowledge organization. In order to distinguish the variouskinds of superstructures, we will add the respective adjectives, and speak of metrical, rhetorical, argumentative, or narrative superstructures. We may similarly characterize the level of linguistic description they operate onfor example, natrativeschemata are semantic superstructures. Finally, the scope of the structures mayencompass a single sentence, a sequence of sentences, or the text as a wholethus, rhetorical alliterations are mostly within the scope of sentences, whereasnarrative structures are inherently textual.The intent of this chapter is not to go into the intricate details of the varioustheories about superstructures of discourse. Thus, we must refer to classical andmodern work in rhetorics, poetics, narrative theory, argumentation theory, and soon, for a discussion of the different units, categories, and rules defining schematicstructures. Here our focus shall be on the cognitive properties of such postulatedschemata. In particular, this chapter will conclude our discussion of the strategicaspects of discourse structure and the process involved in their comprehension. Inother words, we must investigate in what ways superstructure schemata actually canand do play a role in comprehension, storage, and retrieval of discourse. A straightforward hypothesis, for instance, would be that under certain circumstances superstructures may facilitate comprehension, storage, and retrieval of discourse. Thisassumption is dictated by the current paradigm in cognitive psychology, accordingwhich information processing takes place in multiply organized chunks Sentences and discourses are understood and stored on the basis of their units, categories, and levels. Thus more structure often is correlated with additional or morecomplex processing, which results in better structured representations, and hence inbetter retrieval. Since the general principles, rules or strategies, categories, andunits, for each language and culture are learned by the language users, these organizational patterns become preprogrammed, so to speak, which also facilitates understanding. In this respect the two extremes may be, on the one hand, arbitrary lists of237nonsense words and, on the other, highly conventionalized discourses, such aschildrens stories or news stories. As we will see in more detail in Chapter 10, thehighly complex task of understanding, storing, and retrieving discourse necessarilyrequires that the language user assign an optimal structure to the discourse, and thatsuch structures be strategically organized in known categories. Thus, the schematiccategories of a story may function as the conventionalized discourse functions forsemantic macrostructures, namely, as a possible form for the global content ofthe story. For this reason schematic superstructures are sometimes compared tothe syntax of sentences They are, so to speak, the macrosyntax corresponding tothe macrosemantics we have discussed in the previous chapter.We have assumed that superstructures are not merely the theoretical constructsof linguistic or rhetorical models of discourse, but that they should somehow alsofeature in cognitive models of discourse processing. In other words, some principles, categories, or units are cognitively relevant. This cognitive relevancewhichis a notion with intended vaguenessmay be specified in varying degrees ofstrength. It may mean that all rules, categories, or units are known and used assuch in processing. On the other hand, the assumption might be made that someof them are merely constructs of the theory and that only a few, in a specificformat, are cognitively real. In this respect, we can learn from the fate ofgenerative transformational sentence grammar and the early hypotheses aboutthe psychological reality of its units, rules, and transformations. A psychologicalmodel may get valuable suggestions from a more abstract structural theory, but itshould specify further why and how the processing principles, units, andcategories are learned and used, and what the specific memory constraints arethat require them. In the previous chapters, for instance, we have seen that thetheoretical distinction of units and rules of various levels of discourse may notalways be respected by the strategies of comprehension. Similarly, we should notassume that the strategic comprehension of schematic structures necessarilyfollows the levels or categories of an abstract theory of superstructures.Finally, we assume that during comprehension superstructure categories areassigned on the basis of the textual and, above all, the semantic information i.e.,from the bottom up, while, at the same time, assumptions about the canonicalstructure of the discourse, expectations, are generated from the top down aboutthe plausible or possible global semantic content of subsequent episodes in thediscourse. In the next section of this chapter we will try to spell out whatstrategies language users apply in constructing superstructural schemata.7.2. SCHEMATIC STRATEGIESThe assignment of superstructures necessarily has a strategic nature. A language user does not normally wait until the end of a full episode or until the end ofa complete discourse before deciding about the schematic functions of the local orglobal information. And, conversely, once some category of a schema has been238assigned, knowledge about the canonical structure of the schema allows the language user to anticipate information in the text, which will then facilitate readingand comprehension. We shall review some experiments in this section, andreport a new one in the next, which show that superstructure schemata do indeedfacilitate comprehension and recall.As in previous chapters, we assume that the input information for thestrategic, is both contextual and textual. Language users have conventionalizedknowledge about the relations between contextual and textual structures on theone hand and schematic structures on the other. Let us elaborate this claim inmore detail.7.2.1. Cultural InformationContextual information encompasses our knowledge of the whole range ofcommunicative behavior. Language users interact as members of a specific culture,as participants in social situations, as well as at an interpersonal, pragmatic level,and each level has associated with it a variety of conventionalized discourse type,and schematic constraints. Poems, stories, psychological articles, courtroom discourse, etc., are discourse types that are characteristic of culturally variable communicative events. Telling a story, pleading a case, giving a lesson, or writing apapereach is restricted to situations with specific participants, specific goals,norms, and values. This means, conversely, that the participants in a given situationmay expect a range of possible discourse types, some of which may have a conventionalized schema. Once the type of context and the probable type of text is known,strategic guesses can be made about the most probable superstructure schemaGumperz  Hymes, 1972 Bauman  Scherzer, 1974 Sanches  Blount, 1975Freedle, 1979 Chafe, 1979.The cultural aspect of these very general and basic strategies of comprehensionresides in the fact that the context types, text types, and schemata may varyaccording to culture. Both from studies in the ethnography of communicationand from experimental studies it has become clear that narrative schemata, forinstance, may be very different from one culture to an ther. As early as 1932Bartlett had demonstrated that our comprehension, representation, and recall ofan American Indian story is severely restricted by our lack of knowledge of thenarrative schemata underlying such stories. We shall return to some more recentexperimental evidence in what follows.7.2.2. Social Context and InteractionWithin this broader cultural framework, language users participate in communicative events in more or less conventionalized social settings. Features of theinteractional context may be systematically linked with schematic discourse structures, in such a way that, once given contextual information of this kind, thelanguage user may make plausible inferences about the actual categories of the239schema. The most obvious example is the schematic structure of everydayconversations Sudnow, 1972 Psathas, 1979. The constraints on successfulinteraction are mirrored in the conventionalized schematic categories of ongoingtalk. Conversations will differ depending on such features as the sharedknowledge of the participants, their status, age, or other social parameters. Thepresence and style of. say, the category of greeting or leavetaking, as well as thelocal management of opening and closing a topic section, also depend on socialfactors. Thus, it is a contextual constraint that participants will greet each otheronly if they have not seen each other for some time, and the length of such anintroductory category will often be proportionally linked with time of separationand intimacy of the relationship. Cultural differences pertaining to suchhierarchical social relations as rank and status will also help determine thecomplexity, length, style, and content of the category of greetings. Onceparticipants know these social parameters, they will be able to anticipate whetherintroductory turns of the conversation belong to the polite opening ritual or to thecentral topic section of the talk. Similarly, not only the global contents but eventhe narrative schema of a story may depend on properties of the social context Aspeaker may want to convey a recommendation, suggestion. or even a commandto a listener by telling a story KirshenblattGimblett, 1974. In that case anevaluation and a coda may be obligatory categories in the story.7.2.3. Pragmatic InformationSince discourses as a whole may be used to perform global speech acts, theinteractional context will allow plausible inferences about the possible speechacts being performed by the speaker. Not only are there systematic links betweensuch global speech acts and their global semantic content, but the very presenceor ordering of schematic categories may also depend on this pragmaticinformation. Thus, for instance, it is not very plausible for a global request to belocated mainly in the introductory category of a conversation instead, we expectit to be part of the topic section. The same holds true, as we have mentioned, fora possible recommendation in or via a story It will typically not be part of thesetting, the complication, or the resolution, but rather be part of the evaluation orof the coda, taken as a conclusion to the story as a whole. Conversations, letters,and similar exchanges have specific speech acts at conventionally determinedplaces, such as greetings at the beginning and wishes at the end.Both context types and text types may be inherently linked with speech actsequencing and pragmatic schemata, as in everyday conversation. Hence, some texttypes are not merely defined in terms of surface structure style or semantic contentand their schemata, but above all in pragmatic terms. Argumentative discourse is acase in point. Premises and conclusions are schematic categories which not only arelinked through a semantic chain of implication, entailment, implicature, or practicalinference, but also involve speech acts of asserting, assuming, and drawing conclusions. Similarly, an advertisement, for all its freedom from surface and semantic240structure, will at least implicitly feature the speech act of a request, recommendation, or invitation, often at the beginning or end of the text, and often accompaniedby pseudoargumentation.From such contextual information the language user draws strategic inferencesabout plausible contexts and text types and hence about possible schemata or theircategories. In all but the highly predetermined textcontext dependencies of institutional settings, such as courtrooms, classrooms, or parliaments. definite decisionsabout the actual discourse type and their schemata must of course come from thetextual information itself. Not only does there exist a considerable amount offreedom in the kind of discourse possible in each context, but we may also havevarious transformations of the superstructural schemata, such as deletions, permutetions, substitutions, additions, or recombinations. Johnson and Mandler 1980have discussed transformations of the story schema in more detail. Each wellestablished schema has a fundamental canonical form, with respect to which thetransformations can be defined. It is the canonical form that defines precisely thestrategic nature of schema application in a cognitive model In normal circumstances the language user will assume that a discourse exhibits a canonical schema,and that this schema is directly available from knowledge about discourse types in agiven culture. Thus, for stories, the strategic hypothesis will simply be that the firstepisode of the story is information that belongs to the setting. Textual informationmay confirm or disconfirm this hypothesis. If, for instance, the macrostructuralinformation does not fit an expected schematic category, then a bottomup processof matching the presented global content with another category will take place. If astory begins with the description of a murder, it may typically be assumed that theepisode is not part of the setting, but rather of the complication. In part, such aninference may again be stereotypical Knowledge about crime stories allows us tolink murders or similar crimes directly with the complication of the story. In othercircumstances further inferences are necessary If some action or event, for a givenculture and a given reader or listener, can be taken as interesting e.g., funny,dangerous, uncommon, and so on, then it may be assigned the category of acomplication if it is not consistent with the norms, values, goals, or expectationsof the participants described or of the participants in the storytelling event.Readers use various strategies for inferring the schematic categories of textsfrom their semantic macrostructures. Thus, if according to the macrostrategiesdescribed in the previous chapter a language user infers a macroproposition from thefirst sentences of the discourse, the next strategic step will be the assignment ofthe specific superstructure function of that macroproposition. If the first sentencesof a story describe the time, place, participants or, in general, a situation, then thefirst macropropositions may be assigned to the setting category. Similarly, disrupttive events or actionsat the global levelmay be assigned to the complicationcategory, whereas reactive actions of some important participant in the story, whichare aimed at solving a problem or reestablishing a desired situation, may be assigned to the resolution category. We may assume that topdown and bottomupprocesses interact strategically here. Assumptions about the plausible schema de241rived from contextual information or from previous textual information will becombined with local semantic information in order to form and confirmhypotheses about the actual schematic category.Whereas semantic macrostructures. which are the global content of superstructural schemata, play a decisive role in the strategic inferencing of schematic categories, we may also have various surface structure signals for such inferences.Titles and subtitles, as well as various forms of announcements, often explicitlymention the text type and hence the possible schema involved. Thus, for certaindiscourse types, headings in printed text sometimes state the topic andor theschematic category. A characteristic example is provided by scholarly discourse,which typically exhibits such headings as Introduction, Theoretical Framework,Experiment, and Conclusion. Similarly, we have schema category expressions ininitial and final sentences of episodes. such as This story takes place in . . . , Wemay conclude that . . . , Before I start with . . . , and so on.Because schematic categories organize semantic and pragmatic macrostructures, and because macrostructures are derived from local semantic structuresand world knowledge, lexical expressions of local semantic content may alsobe signal, for schema categories, typically so at the beginning and the end ofepisodes. An expression such as Suddenly, for instance, will often indicate thebeginning of a complication episode, whereas Thus may introduce a conclusionsection. Sometimes formulaic expressions are used for the contents or speechacts subsumed by a schema category. Once upon a time . . . not only opens achildrens story but also indicates the setting category. The formulaic structure ofofficial letters, document,.,. and institutional discourse may also be linked withschematic categories.Finally, the phonetic. morphological, graphical, and paratextual features ofongoing discourse may hint at special categories Leads in news stories are oftenprinted in bold type complications in stories may be introduced with higherpitch. loudness, or stress and initial greetings and final greetings, i.e. theclosings in conversation have similar surface or paratextual properties.What has been said here about such wellknown schematic structures asthose of stories or argumentations also holds, mutatis mutandis, for other kindsof schemata and their strategic processing. Metrical and prosodic schemata arelimited to very specific discourse types, often literary or ritual, and areindicated by special contexts e.g., literary or esthetic ones. Inasmuch as suchschemata constitute a further organization of surface structures that isuncommon in other discourse types. they can be perceived immediately andrecognized as such on the basis of specially learned cues. In part, this is alsotrue of many rhetorical operations, such as alliteration, rhyme, parallelism, andsemantic figures such as metaphors. All these literary, esthetic, or rhetoricalschemata, and their categories, do not have specific meanings as such, but mayhave various functions, for example, a persuasive function in thecommunicative context where they may influence the acceptability of thediscourse. It may be assumed, and it has been demonstrated experimentally, thatthese additional forms of organization allow a better representation inepisodic memory and hence better retrieval Surface structures which normally are242forgotten quickly can be inserted into nontrivial categories of a schema. It is a wellknown fact, from classical poetics and rhetorics onward, that metrical, prosodic,and rhetorical figures have not only an esthetic or persuasive function but also amnemonic one Groeben, 1982.7.3. SCHEMATIC ANALYSIS OFTHE NEWSWEEK TEXTIt has been argued in this chapter that many types of discourse have aconventional global schema or superstructure. Such a superstructure provides akind of overall functional syntax for the semantic macrostructures. That is,macropropositions and the episodes dominated by them may be assigned to aconventional schematic category determining their function within the discourseas a whole. Thus, many discourses have some kind of introduction andconclusion category.News discourse, as it appears in news stories in newspapers, television programs, or news weeklies, also can be assigned a conventional superstructure.Empirical research on such news discourse schemata is still in its initial stageThorndyke, 1979 Findahl  Hijer, 1981 Larsen, 1982, and systematicdescriptive and comparative research is necessary to establish the variouscategories of the news schema van Dijk, 1981b, 1983a, 1983b. Before wegive a schematic analysis of the Newsweek test see front endpapers, we willbriefly discuss some of the major categories of news discourse schemata.One of the most obvious initial categories of news is that of headlines. Wehave seen in the previous chapter that such headlines are typical strategic cuesfor the derivation of macrostructures, of which they usually express a fragment.Often, there is not just one headline, but also a super and a subheadline, aboveand below the main headline. We ignore whether these represent differentaspects of the macrostructure. In principle, we will assume that all headlinepropositions represent macroinformation. The communicative function ofheadlines is clear They attract attention also due to larger andor bold print,summarize the macrostructure of the text, and hence serve as a cue for thereaders strategic decisionmaking process as to whether he or she will or willnot read the text. Also, headlines are the minimal information about therespective events of the news, so that they constitute the basis for the process ofskimming the paper.Often the headline category will be followed by a lead, consisting of one or afew sentences, expressing the macrostructure of the text. Leads will also often beprinted in larger or bold type, and along with the headline they typically occur ininitial position. Leads do not only summarize the text, but also serve as anintroduction. Thus, arguments introduced in the lead may be coreferred with,even in pronominal form, by expressions in the proper text of the news discoursei.e., in the body. Both headline and lead form the overall summaryinformation of the news discourse.News discourse may be characterized as a specific kind of story, hence243the frequent use of the term news story. They are stories in the sense that they areabout relevant interesting, important events and actions, which are often eventsand actions disrupting the goals of persons, groups, or societies. Yet, news doesnot have the conventional superstructure of everyday stories, which indeed mayhave summarizing announcement categories as in Did you hear about Johnsaccident, but which further will be primarily organized by a conditionallyordered set of categories, such as complication and resolution, possibly followedby an evaluation and a coda. News stories, instead, have a relevance structure.That is, their main schematic categories are ordered by communicativeimportance. So, we first have the headline, with the shortest possible summary,then the lead with a proper summary, and then we expect the major eventsconstituting the news of the day. Hence, we will simply postulate an eventcategory, featuring propositions or macropropositions denoting the mostimportant news events. This category may well be discontinuous. That is,fragments of it may be interspersed throughout the text, so that more importantevents in the interpretation of the journalist come first and less important onescome last. The latter may, in fact, typically be placed at the end, in part fortechnical reasons When the editor cuts the journalists text to fit the availablespace, only the least important information will get lost. Newspaper news willtherefore hardly have important categories e.g., the conclusion in the end.These will, on the contrary, occur in the lead.Although we now have the core of a news discourse schema, many newsstories will be more complex, especially if relatively much information isreserved for the event this complexity is due to many factors see Galtung  Rage,1970 van Dijk, 1981c. Thus, first the text may refer to previous informationgiven about the same event cued by phrases like As we already reportedyesterdayin an earlier edition . . . . This previous information category has anobvious function in our processing model It typically activates the situationmodel the reader already may have about the same event situation. In otherdiscourses as well e.g., in everyday conversation, in continuing lectures, at thebeginning of new chapters in a book, and so on we find such reminders ofprevious information, which have typical intertextual functions.Next, each event may itself be placed within a context. This context may firstof all be historical. The news in that case specifies, sometimes also as areminder, the events that have led to the actual events. Then, the context mayalso be actual. In that category we will typically find further information aboutthe cooccurring events or situations of an event e.g., the visit of the Americanpresident to Europe will be the context for the reported event of ademonstration in Europe against U.S. policy in Central America. We see thatsome of the context factors may be actual conditions, but this need not be thecase. Actual events may just be parts of a wider context of events or situation.Similarly, events and their context will often be described against somebackground. Thus, demonstrations in Europe against the visit of the Americanpresident may take place against the background of antiAmericanattitudes among many young Europeans. Backgrounds typically place an eventin a larger perspective. They will describe the socioeconomic situation of a244country about which some political event has been reported, or describe livingconditions in a ghetto in which riots have taken place.Sometimes both context and backgrounds have the overall function of anexplanation. They provide the factors the readers must know in order tounderstand why and how the events reported have taken place. In terms of ourprocessing model, context and background precisely provide, for the nonexpertreader, the necessary situation model details plus general semantic memoryframes necessary for understanding. An explanation need not remain implicit inthe context an, background category, though. It may also be explicit, namely,when the journalist explicitly indicates which of the factors of the context andbackground are causally or structurally linked with the actual events.Events usually have consequences, which we may therefore expect news stories to mention in a consequences category. Such a category will often makeexplicit, why the events are so important, why they are relevant to us, how theyaffect our Country. our economy, or that of our important allies or enemies.Consequences may themselves be events or situations as results, but they alsomay be the verbal or other reactions of relevant persons, for example, of peoplewho are politically important. The comments category, therefore, is an importantone in international news. This category is also one that can be flexibly used bythe newspaper to give implicitly its own opinions about the events, for example,by selecting or editing the comments of specific political persons. Of course, thesame holds for the specification of context, backgrounds, and the verydescription of the events News discourse is not just a description of someevents, but a subjective reconstruction w events, or rather of several discoursesreports, international news agency telexes, communications, press conferences,etc. about such events see van Dijk, 1981c, for details.What we have described are some major categories of news stories in Western newspapers there are, of course, many local, national, or international variations on this schema. Thus, the ordering may be somewhat different, somecategoriessuch as context and backgroundmay be optional, and furthercategories may be given. For example, some newspapers will, perhaps as part ofcontext or background, provide biographical sketches of newly introducedimportant person, e.g., in a footnoteas Le Monde does. There are alsovariations in format among the different news media. Television news has itsown format see Glasgow University Media Group, 1977, 1980, as do weeklies.Weekliessuch as American Time and Newsweek, German Der Spiegel, FrenchlErpress and Le Nouvel Observateur, Italian Espresso, and Dutch HangsePost HP, all in magazine formatdo indeed seem to have a slightly differentnews schema. In contrast to the daily newspapers and television news,weeklies do not report actual news. Instead, they provide articles with muchmore context, background, consequences, and perhaps evaluations a categorywhich in the newspaper is often reserved for the editorials, which are expresslyseparated from the newsin keeping with the ideology that facts andopinion are two different things. Because weeklies are read in a differentway than newspapers, skimming is less important, so that leads will occur less245often, or perhaps as part of special boxes. Although first sentences mayfunction partly as such summarizing thematic sentences, they often just givesome striking detail e.g., a description of an interesting situation, action, orevent, or the comment of some important politician. Time used to have a styleimitated, e.g., by Der Spiegel in which first sentences would start with someintimate detail about the actions of some important person, in order to give someinside flavor to the article. Also, weekly articles will have definite length moreoften than newspaper articles, hence they may well have important information,such as conclusions, at the end.If we now turn to our Newsweek text see front endpapers, we observe thatmany of the hypothetical categories that have been discussed here indeed featurein the superstructural schema. In Table 7. 1 , we have listed the macropropositionsfrom our analysis given in the previous chapter, and we have strategically, thatis, on line and on the basis of flexible information input, assigned schematiccategories to each. Because the strategic comprehension process of superstructurecategories does not take place only at the macrolevel, but also at the word,clause, and sentence levels, we also indicate in Table 7.1 which local informationcues may be relevant for superstructure formation. Thus, changes of paragraphs,marking change,, of episode and hence of macroproposition global topic, willoften also be cues for changes in superstructure category. Similarly, a changefrom present tense to past tenses will often mark the beginning of a historicalbackground category.Strategic comprehension of schematic categories often involves topdownprocessing. We do not know to what extent readers have conscious knowledgeabout the news schema, but we assume that they have learned such a schemaafter the many thousands of news texts read during their adult life. Probably wewould be aware of the schematic categories only when they are missing,although some of them might not be necessary or constitutive categories, butrather categories defining good reporting in quality newspapers. We thus assumethat the communicative context will activate specific expectations about the typeof discourse involved. and therefore also some implicit expectations aboutpossible overall schemata for the news.Another reason for our hypothesis that the categories mentioned earlier dohave some cognitive relevance and not only abstract structural reality, is the factthat several of them have direct communicative functions, such as the headlineand the lead, whereas others have immediate processing function correlates Theprevious information category, as we suggested, activates situation modelscontext reminds or constructs further new details for such a situation model so thatthe information about actual events can be understood and backgrounds mayactivate specific semantic memory frames or scripts. Consequences or evaluation,finally, indicate the pragmatic and hence communicative relevance of the news itemfor the reader or the readers reference groups. In other words, the categories arenot arbitrary, but have communicative, social, and cognitive relevance.We assumed earlier that schematic superstructures assign textual functions tomacropropositions. We also assumed that such interpretations take place strategically, that is, on line with the linear interpretation of subsequent sentences and the246N ATable 7.1Schematic Strategies in the Comprehension of the Newsweek TextMacropropoaitiosee Table 6.2l.

Yet, for the moment we ignore theprecise locus of schematic superstructure formation. Part of it is top down, as wesaw. triggered by communicative context and expected text type, and henceimmediately available. But some other categories may be triggered by purelylocal information e.g., paragraph change or triggered only after the formationof macropropositions to which they assign functions. We will provisionallyassume that the process will use information from all these levels butpredominantly operates at a macrolevel. Therefore, we provide macropropositionsas input in Table 7. 1.If we inspect Table 7.1, we first observe that some macropropositions, due totheir complex propositional structure, may have several functions at the sametime. Thus, M4 says something about the political background in Guatemala, butalso specifies some historical contexts the CIAbacked coup of the actual U.S.involvement and the power of the conservative elite. Similarly, M11 may beinterpreted as specifying actual events, namely, the Guatemalan reactions toAmerican diplomacy, or rather because past actions are involved as being aboutthe previous events of the actual events strain in relations between the UnitedStates and Guatemala. Again, M13 may be seen as part of the context thegeneral armament sources of the elite or as a preparatory condition of the mainevents fighting tile guerrillas. And, finally, M21 may be a statement aboutlikely consequences, derived from general political knowledge about CentralAmerica, or be an evaluative comment, implying that it is wrongor at least notdesirable in terms of U.S. policythat the guerrillas be strengthened. It is notproblematic that macropropositionsor at least their component simplepropositionshave different functions. But we still lack unambiguous criteria forthe differentiation of some categories. despite our attempts at definition givenearlier. Further descriptive work will have to specify such criteria.In Figure 7.1 we have tried to capture the overall resulting schema of theNewsweek text. We see that on the whole the superstructure indeed organizes therespective macropropositions of the text, sometimes dominating just one, inother cases a whole sequence. The order of the macropropositions, as expressedby the sentences in the text, roughly corresponds to the terminal categories of thesuperstructure. Sometimes, though, there may be transformations, as we alsoknow from narrative theory. Thus consequences may be spelled out first due tothe relevance criterionand only then their reasons or causes given.We have argued that macropropositions serve as the input to the schematicstructure, although actual processing may be more complex. Indeed, even localpropositions may suggest possible schematic categories. Thus, as we suggestedearlier, M4 is based on S3, which expresses different propositions, some aboutthe actual situation, some about the historical context. Embedded clauses,especially temporal or relative ones, may, together with tense changes denotingtime change, be used as local cues for the derivation of the appropriatesuperstructure categories.It is probably appropriate to repeat here some of the remarks we made inChapter 1 about the boundary conditions of our model. We do not claim that readersof the Newsweek article will form a macrostructure organized schematically as250251shown in Figure 7.1. This figure shows what could happenfor a reader who issufficiently motivated and has sufficient resources, as well as a greater thanaverage familiarity with news report schema. An actual, given reader in somespecific situation will form a macrostructure that may be not only quite differentfrom the one we have derived for this text depending on the readers knowledge,opinions, and political attitude, but also much more sketchy and incomplete.Furthemore, schematic organization, too, will merely reflect some of thedistinctions which we have indicated in Figure 7.1. Complete processing of theavailable information is an idealization we use in illustrating our modelnotsomething we expect from an actual reader.7.4. PREDICTIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF THETHEORY OF SCHEMATIC SUPERSTRUCTURESIt is an axiom concerning memory that organization, especially meaningfulorganization, aids retention. Schematic superstructures provide additionalorganization to a text, therefore such structures should make it easier toremembers a text. The additional structure should also be useful in the veryprocess of comprehending. Since comprehending implies finding an appropriateorganization for a text. the more possibilities there are for organizing a text, theeasier this task should be. Hence, the theory proposed here makes the generalprediction that schematic superstructures should facilitate comprehension as wellas memory for text.We may specify this general statement in a number of ways. First of all,superstructures must be not only in the text, but also in the readers or listenersmind. One must know about conventional schemata before one can use them. Someof these schemata are learned very early. For instance, Poulson et al. 1979obtained strong evidence that 4yearold children already had some knowledgeof the conventional narrative schema and were actively employing thisknowledge in story understanding.At a general level, there is much evidence from the work on story grammarsthat superstructures facilitate comprehension and memory. Open questionsremain, however, and many details need to be worked out. Thus, one wouldexpect that the use of surface signals to indicate the schematic categories of atext would be helpful. but as yet no systematic studies of this problem areavailable but see Section 7.5. Similarly, one would expect a canonicalschematic organization to be easier to detect in a text and hence make the texteasier to comprehend and remember than transformed superstructures. The onlyexperimental studies bearing on this prediction involve some very radicaltransformations, namely, the random reordering of whole paragraphs. If thisreordering is done carefully so that the local coherence of the text is notdisrupted e.g., by avoiding the occurrence of pronouns without referents, afrequent result when sentences are scrambled, some rather surprising resultsare obtained, which superficially seem to contradict the prediction just made.Thus, Kintsch, Mandel, and Kozminsky 1977 had subjects summarize simple,252wellformed stories from Bocaccios Decameron which were read either in theoriginal, canonical form or with their paragraphs randomly reordered. Their subjects were able to summarize these stories equally well whether or not they hadbeen scrambled. However, this does not mean that the canonical ordering was ofno help to the subjects, as they did take longer to read the scrambled stories thanthe wellordered ones. It thus appears that, given these simple, schemaconforming stories. subjects were ablealbeit with an extra effortto overcomethe confusion caused by presenting the paragraphs in random order and tomentally assign the paragraphs to their proper schematic categories. The basis forthis assignment could be the content of the stories and whatever schematicsignals still remained in them i.e., other than order, normally a potent cue.Knowing what schematic categories to expect in a story made it possible toreorder the scrambled text.Confirming this interpretation was the finding that subjects always wrotetheir summaries in the canonical order, whether or not the text they had read wasin that order. One would, of course, predict that texts that lack a conventionalschematic superstructure, or that have a structure unfamiliar to the reader, wouldbe more sensitive to paragraph scrambling.The Kintsch, Mandel, and Kozminsky 1977 study illustrates how carefulone must be in interpreting experimental results. On the face of it, the mainresultthat scrambled stories are summarized as well as normal onessuggeststhat superstructures are superfluous. But, if one considers the fact that thescrambled stories were harder to read, together with other internal evidencediscussed in the original report the story that corresponded least well to a simplenarrative schema was the one subjects had the most trouble with in the scrambledform, the true implications of these results become apparent What we see hereis not the lack of a storyschema effect, but, on the contrary, a very powerfuleffect that permits readers to overcome the deficiencies of the scrambledpresentation order.Anectodal evidence suggests that readers may have a tendency to imposeschematic orderings on texts that are not really appropriate. The superstructurethat people are most familiar with and handle most easily is the narrative schemaGraesser, Hoffman,  Clark, 1980. Thus, a narrative organization is sometimessuperimposed on texts that are not stories a news report, for instance, may beunderstood as a story Thorndyke, 1979 Larsen, 1982.Schematic superstructures are learned some, such as the story schema, arelearned very early, others only through specialized training e.g., various literarytext types. Superstructures are, therefore, culture specific. What happens when onereads a text for which one does not know the appropriate schema has been shown inseveral studies, including Kintsch and Greene 1978. In this study, Americancollege students were asked to summarize a Grimms fairy tale, which correspondedclosely to their expectations about narratives, and an Apache Indian story, whichcompletely violated them. For the former, subjects wrote good summaries in contrast, the latter with its unfamiliar narrative structure, was summarized very badly,often with whole sections missing. Such poor summaries rarely occurred when thesubjects knew the schema according to which the story was constructedthe slots253of the schema were there and had only to be filled in. It is interesting to note thatthe difficulties subjects had with the Indian folktale were at the macrolevel onlyWhen the sentences of the two stories were rated for comprehensibility out ofcontext, that is, just as separate sentences, those from the Indian folktale werejudged to be just as easy as those from the Grimms fairy tale. Steffensen,Jogdeo, and Anderson 1980 reported a study that makes a similar point,although they investigated a culturespecific action schema rather than a culturespecific text structure. Wedding ceremonies in the United States and in India arevery different, and American students found it easy to remember a description ofan American wedding but not of an Indian wedding, whereas for Indian studentsthe results were reversed see also Freedle, 1979 Chafe, 1979.The question in all of these studies, as well as in the story grammar literatureall a whole see our review in Section 2.8, is the extent to which these resultsare due to the influence of textual superstructures per se, or, alternatively, tonontextual factors, such as action schemata. Clearly, culturespecific knowledgeabout wedding ceremonies was the source of the performance differences in theSteffensen et al. study. In the Kintsch and Greene work both the textualsuperstructure la familiar narrative schema and the content of the stories favoredthe Grimms fairy tale As is proper for stories in our culture, the fairy tale wasabout human actions and was thus temporally and causally coherent the Indianstory, on the other hand, lacked u temporalcausal organization. Differencesbetween the two, therefore, may be due to either textual narrative schema ornontextual factors the structure of actions.All work on stories suffers from this confounding, as we saw in Chapter 2 inour discussion of the story grammar controversy. We have, of course, strongtheoretical reasons to assume that superstructures must play an importantcognitive role, as we outlined earlier. The culturally determined ordering of thedescription in a story, their completeness and level of detail, principles ofperspective in storytelling, and even the narrative categories go beyond theactions themselves. We know more about action descriptions than we knowabout actions. But, stories are so closely tied to actions that it is almostimpossible to unconfound text and action structure experimentally within thatcontext. However, one can avoid this problem, at least partially, by looking atother types of text. In particular, descriptive texts are often not as tightlyconstrained by their content as action texts. Thus, in laboratory experiments suchtexts might provide a clearer picture of the psychological effects of schematicsuperstructures. An investigation involving descriptive texts and their rhetoricalschemata is reported in what follows.7.5. EXPERIMENT 5 THE ROLE OFRHETORICAL STRUCTURE IN DESCRIPTIVE TEXTSA variety of conventional patterns can be found in descriptive texts Kieras Bovair, 1981 Meyer  Freedle, in press. Readers are not nearly as familiar withthem as with the narrative schema, but college students will have at least an implicit254understanding of such rhetorical forms as arguments, definition, classifications,illustration, and procedural descriptions. Descriptive textsessaysare rarely pureexamples of one or another of these forms, but rather combine these and otherstructures in multiple, unpredictable ways. Nevertheless, the ability to recognizethese rhetorical structures in an essay may be of considerable help to the readerand may permit him or her to organize the text more easily. Suppose, forinstance, that a student is reading a chapter in a science textbook. He or sherealizes not necessarily consciously that a paragraph is organized according tosome known rhetorical form, say as a definition, perhaps because the authorannounced specifically We are now going to define X, or perhaps because ofmore subtle, indirect cues. We are assuming that the student at this point calls upa rhetorical schema definition, and organizes the paragraph around that schema.The student knows that definitions are often of the form genus  differentiaeclass  special characteristics, and hence looks for the genus in the text, as wellas for primary and secondary characteristics. These immediately become themacropropositions of the text, to which the other propositions in the text can besubordinated. Thus, rhetorical structure allows for a certain amount of topdownprocessing, and, although it i quite likely that a similar organization of the textcould have been achieved through a more careful analysis of the textpropositions themselves, laborious bottomup inferencing can in this way bebypassed.The task of the essay writer, then, is to make sure that the right kind ofrhetorical schema is triggered by the text, in which case the reader should arriveat an optimal organization of the text, congruent with the authors intentions.One wav to achieve this goal is to use rhetorical forms in their canonical orderand to signal the various categories as clearly as possible. On the other hand, ifthe author hide,, the rhetorical structure of a text through the use of sometransformations sensible ones, not random reorderings and in addition omits allrhetorical signals, the reader would probably still comprehend the text if it issimple enough and deals with some familiar topic, but would be more likely tomiss a few points or misrepresent the authors intentions.Two experiments investigating this prediction have recently been completedin our laboratory see Kintsch  Yarbrough, 1982, for more detail. Good andbad texts were constructed which were identical in their content, but differed intheir rhetorical organization. If students use rhetorical strategies as suggestedhere, then the good texts ought to be easier to comprehend than the bad ones,because it should be easier to form appropriate macrostructures for the former.However, whether or not an essay is well organized rhetorically should havelittle or no effect on the local processing of the text, because, according to ourtheory, rhetorical structures have their effects at the macrolevel. Therefore,comprehension tests that are sensitive m the macrolevel should reveal the effectsof rhetorical structure whereas tests that are only related to microprocessesshould not.We have chosen direct questions about the macrostructure as a means ofassessing the macroprocesses in our experimental subjects. Thus subjects wereasked What is this text about and What are the main ideas the author wanted255to get across On the other hand, a cloze test provides a way to assess microprocesses. If every fifth word in a paragraph is omitted and subjects have toguess what it is supposed to be, their performance is determined primarily byhow well they understand each sentence or phrase in its local context and shouldbe fairly independent of their success or failure to achieve global organization ofthe text.We did not try in this study to distinguish what makes for good or badrhetorical form. Thus, we did not differentiate between the effects of canonicalordering and various kinds of rhetorical signals in the text.It is possible that good rhetorical form is most useful when the text is rathercomplex at the macrolevel for simple, straightforward texts, macrostructures canbe generated even without their help. Therefore, we included a second factor inour experiment, namely, the structural complexity of the text. For each rhetoricalcategory we wrote one paragraph that was structurally simple e.g., astraightforward classification and one that was always structurally complexe.g., involving subclassifications. We tried to keep the simple and complextexts comparable in term of familiarity of the topic, sentence complexity, andother such variables. but. of course, they differ on many dimensions in unknownways. Therefore. a simple main effect due to complexity would be of littleinterest. Indeed, it would be surprising if peoples ability to answer questionsabout the main ideas in a text would not be influenced by the structuralcomplexity of the text. However, the question of whether complexity interactswith rhetorical form is of real interest.7.5.1. Method and ProcedureIn the first experiment, four rhetorical structures were employed classification, illustration, comparison and contrast, and procedural description. For eachstructure, a simple and a complex paragraph were prepared. The texts were writtento conform as closely as possible to their respective rhetorical schemata. They werethen transformed to make them less schema conforming. The transformation involved the reordering and deletion of rhetorical signals from the text. An example ofa text in good rhetorical form is given in Table 7.2. It is a simple illustration withthe topic stated in the first paragraph, and then an example provided in each ofthe following four paragraphs. These paragraphs are also arranged in their logicalorder. In Table 7.3, the transformed text is shown. The order of paragraphs is nolonger canonical, and two rhetorical signals present in the original text have beendeleted the next of Paragraph 4 has been replaced with an uninformativeusually, and finally we find in the last paragraph has been changed to it should benoted that. One more word had to be changed in order to make the text in Table7.3 coherent morereplaced by rather would have been strange in the firstsentence because no basis for the comparison has yet been specified.The texts were from 205 to 420 words long. The good and bad versions werealways equally long. The content of the good and bad versions was identical exceptfor 4.6 words, on the average, which were changed as explained in the precedingparagraph.256Table 7.2An Example of a Simple Classification Text in Good Rhetorical FormIn order to obtain an understanding of how man has evolved it is often helpful toanalyze him in relation to the other primates. One major way of seeing this relationship isby examining locomotor patterns.The most developmentally constricted form of locomotion is called vertical clingingand leaping. All prosimians fall into this form. In this pattern the animal normally clingsto the branch with its head above its limbs. In its predominant locomotive form the animalpushes off from the branch or tree with it, hind limb, und springs or leaps to the next.A developmentally more advanced form is quadrupedalism.

Macaques and howler monkeys typify this form.Next is ape locomotion which is characterized by arm swinging andor occasionallinked branchtobranch swinging, climbing, and knuckle walking. The gibbon,orangutan, and chimpanzee locomotive patterns arc characterized by this form.Finally, we find bipedalism which is the characteristic locomotive form of manBipedalism includes standing, striding, and running. This form completes an adaptivedevelopmental sequence which began sometime in the deep past with vertical clingingand leaping.For each text, there were two questions. The first was always What is thisessay about A correct answer for the text shown in Tables 7.2 and 7.3 wouldhave been types of locomotion or some paraphrase thereof. The second questionasked for the main points in each text, for example, What are the four major pointsmade for the text in Tables 7.2 and 7.3. A correct answer in this case would be tolist in some way the four types of locomotion described in the article, either ingenera terms bipedalism or by example walking. The number of main pointswas not always the same for different texts but was identical, or course, for thegood and bad versions.Table 7.3An Example of a Simple Classification Text in Poor Rhetorical FormA developmentally rather advanced form is quadrupedalism.

The same words were then deleted from the poorversions. Each subject received either all eight good texts or all eight bad texts,and was tested either with the cloze test or with the macrostructure topic ormain idea questions.7.5.2. ResultsThe main results of the experiment are shown in Figure 7.2. Subjects weremuch better at answering topic or main idea questions when they read the rhetorically good versions of the paragraphs S1 correct than when they read the poorversions 26 correct. This difference was highly significant statistically.As expected, the answers to the complex texts were less likely to be correctthan the answers to the simple texts 42 versus 35, but the interesting findingwas that there was no sign of an interaction between complexity and the presence orabsence of rhetorical structure. An analysis of variance yielded an F  1 for thisinteraction. Rhetorical structure was just as helpful with the simple texts as withthe complex ones.The pattern of results was completely different when comprehension was assessed with the cloze test. Rhetorical form was simply irrelevant as far as thesubjects ability to guess the deleted words was concerned. Subjects guessed 40.7of the words correctly in the good versions and 41.7 in the poor versions. Structural complexity was similarly unrelated to cloze performance 41.5 correct258guesses on the good versions did not differ statistically from 40.9 on the poorversions.7.5.3. Experiment 5BA ReplicationIn a second experiment, two different texts were used, a simple and a morecomplex definition. Again, we wrote these paragraphs so that they correspondedideally to the rhetorical form of x definition, and then transformed them toconceal as well as possible their rhetorical structure, without changing either thecontent or the integrity of the text itself. Thirtytwo subjects participated in thisexperiment, and the procedure was in essential respects identical to that of thefirst experiment. The results for the definitions were very much as in theprevious case, as shown in Figure 7.3. Good rhetorical form greatly facilitatedperformance on the topic and main idea questions. Indeed, the poor version ofthe complex paragraph was almost unintelligible to our college student subjects,with only 6Ic of the main ideas identified correctly. Complexity also producedthe expected main effect, in that subjects did much better with the simpleparagraphs. But, once again, complexity did not interact with rhetorical form.For the cloze test the presence or absence of259rhetorical structure was inconsequential 41.0 correct for the good formsversus 40.5 for the bad forms. Cloze performance was marginally better forthe simple than for the complex texts.7.5.4. DiscussionThe implications of these two studies are quite clear. Good rhetorical formcan significantly enhance the comprehension of descriptive passages at themacrolevel. Our college student subjects had presumably enough experiencewith the rhetorical structures used in these experiments that they had formedrepresentations thereof schemata which matched the input in those cases whereit was well structured rhetorically. Once such a schema was activated by asuitable input, it guided the subjects to form appropriate macrostructures.It is not clear what happened when the rhetorical structure was absent.Perhaps subjects did not form macropropositions at all, more likely theygenerated inappropriate ones, picking out some salient detail from the text, ratherthan the main idea that we, as the authors, had intended to convey. The fact thatmost of the errors in answering the questions were incorrect responses ratherthan omissions is not informative in this respect, since it most likely reflects taskdemands If subjects are asked to state two main points, they will give tworesponses, even if they have to make them up on the spot.Meyer, Brandt, and Bluth 1980 reported some free recall data which supportthe present results. In their study, texts that were well organized rhetorically wererecalled better than loose, listlike structures. According to our interpretation, thisresult is to be expected because rhetorical schemata play a role in the macrostructureformation and free recall depends to a considerable extent on the macrostructure.In free recall, however, micro and macroprocesses are confounded in ways thatare hard to extricate. Indeed, a modeldependent analysis such as that of Kintschand van Dijk 1978 is necessary for that purpose. In the present experiments, aclearer separation between macro and microprocesses has been achieved.Rhetorical form was shown to have large effects on the former, but none on thelatter. This finding has important implications for comprehension testing. Onefirst has to have a very clear idea what aspect of the comprehension process is tobe evaluated, and then a test must be constructed that is adequate for thatpurpose. This obvious point is often not appreciated in practice. One frequentlysees cloze tests being used to validate readability tests, for instance. Then it isargued that texts with a good readability score are easier for students to read.Such claims reflect superficial and inadequate analyses of the problem ofcomprehension testing. No progress can be made in this area until testingprocedures are based on a detailed understanding of the psychologicalprocesses involved in comprehension. There is no unitary processcomprehension that could be measured once and for all if we could but findthe right test. Comprehension is a common sense term which dissolves uponcloser analysis into many different subprocesses. Thus, we need to constructseparate measurement instruments for macroprocesses, knowledge integration, co260herence, parsing, etc., as discussed in these chapters. A test for one level mayhave no bearing on another, as we have just shown in these experiments.Comprehension is just a convenient term for the aggregate of these processes itis not to be reified. not to be tested for.Results like the present ones Kintsch  Yarbrough, 1982 and those ofMeyer et al. 1980 are less ambiguous with respect to the psychological role ofschematic superstructures than are the studies in the narrative domain. As wehave seen, the difficulty in the latter studies is to unconfound textual structurefrom the structure of the content itself. Stories are about actions and readersknow a lot about the structure of actions, inside or outside of stories. The contentin descriptive texts is much less constrained. Temporal and causal relations playa decisive role in stories see the discussion of Johnson  Mandler, 1980 but areabsent in some types of descriptive texts. This is not to say that content does notconstrain the form of an essay, but the constraints are certainly much weakerthan in the case of stories. Hence demonstrations that rhetorical superstructuresaffect comprehension and memory in these cases can be accepted with someconfidence.Chapter 8Production Strategies8.1. PROBLEMS OF A PRODUCTION MODELFOR DISCOURSEIt is well known that most work done in psycholinguistics is about comprehension. In this respect the psychology of discourse is no exception. Our earliermodel of discourse is also mainly about comprehension. Production was an issuelimited to some aspects of reproduction, mainly in the framework of recallexperiments. How language users go about producing a new discourse, eithermonological or as part of a dialogue, is a problem we know little about but seeClark  Clark, 1977 Chapters 6 and 7 Butterworth, 1980 Gregg  Steinberg,1980. In this book we will not even attempt to supply an adequate answer to thisimportant question of language use, but will merely formulate a number ofspecific problems and some suggestions about the strategic aspects of discourseproduction as they seem to emerge from the previous chapters oncomprehension.A first observation in this respect is the restatement of an insight, which grewover at least 10 years of psycholinguistic research, that processes of production arenot simply the reverse of processes of comprehension Hirsch, 1977 Olson, Mack, Duffy, 1981 Rubin, 1980. The application of early ideas from generativetransformational grammar suggested that the grammar was a model of linguisticcompetence, and that such a model was neutral regarding the production or comprehension processes of language use. Although this assumption may have somevalidity for the account of such abstract objects as sentential or textual structures assuch, it certainly does not hold for the cognitive model itself in which analysis and262synthesis are related yet complementary processes Fodor, Bever,  Garrett, 1974388ff. Garrett, 1980 212ff.. From the point of view of our strategy model thisis of course a truism. The initial data and the goals of the processes are different,and, therefore, the strategies themselves must be different Comprehension,which has surface structures as input and semantic or pragmatic representationsas a cognitive goal, makes rather different demands on the system that doesproduction, which starts from some knowledge or beliefs, or from some semanticor pragmatic representation and has surface structure expression as its goal.Yet it does not seem wise to go to the other extreme and postulate completelyseparate processes. The first reason for this caveat is economical It seems highlyimplausible that language users would not have recourse to the same or similarlevels, units, categories, rules, or strategies in both the productive and thereceptive processing of discourse In both they handle surface structures andsemantic representations, and many of the rulegoverned and the strategicrelations between these will feature both in production and in comprehension.Second, we have seen on many occasions that comprehension is not simply apassive or bottomup process. Much of our understanding is active, top down,constructive, and predictive Given some contextual and textual information, alanguage user may derive inferences about what to expect, at least from asemantic and stylistic point of view. Therefore, it will be interesting for theproduction model to specify which structures and principles have a more generalnature, characterizing discourse processing in either direction, and whichstrategies are typical either for production or for comprehension. In trying toaccount for the stepbystep moves of the actual processing, it is precisely in thisstrategic approach that we may discover some of the particularities because itdiffers essentially from an abstract, structuralistic model,5.1.1. The Input ProblemThe study of production has been somewhat of a stepchild in the developmentof the psychology of language Butterworth, 1980. Why do so many psychologistsprefer to study comprehension rather than production The answer lies largely inhistorical trends both within psychology and within linguistics. Psychologists havea longstanding interest in general questions about comprehension, not only oflanguage but also in other areas such as perception. Linguists, on the other hand,have primarily been concerned with the structure of utterances and have developedsophisticated theories about these structures. Thus, psycholinguists had a reasonably wellunderstood independent variable for their experiments the structure of thelanguage input. They could then concentrate on what happened to that input duringprocessing. Even the grammer itself is, despite claims to the contrary, biasedtoward analysis It usually starts off with phonetic strings and phonological, morphological, and syntactic structures, which are interpreted by the semantic component. This bias is in part due to the historical development of linguistics itself Bothstructuralism and the influence of behaviorism favored the analysis of observablephenomena, and hence of surface structures, leaving to psychology the account of263such vague cognitive phenomena as meaning. Against this background it wasnatural that the psychology of language would be concerned primarily withanalysis. decoding, interpretation, and hence with comprehension, rather thanwith production.Within psychology, the experimental approach has its own requirements. Theneed for adequate control demands input that can be precisely specified. and o.again, words, phrases, sentences, or discourses are taken as the point ofdeparture. rather than some unknown semantic representation or vague structuresin memory.8.1.2. Methods and Concepts for StudyingDiscourse ProductionWhereas our intuitions about the processes underlying the surface formulationof sentences do not seem to be very strong with the possible exception of conscious, stylistically determined, lexical choice, our intuitions about discourse production are much stronger. Especially in complex written discourse production, wemay well be conscious of or even reflect about what to say and how to say it.Systematic protocol analysis of these thoughts may thus provide interesting datafor the production model Hayes  Flower, 1980.The production of meaningful and contextually adequate linguistic utterancesshould be viewed as a complex task which needs planning. Whereas at the sentencelevel this planning may be more or less automatic, complex discourse seems torequire a kind of planning that is similar to the planning of complex actions andit would therefore be instructive to make interesting cognitive generalizationsthat cover both kinds of processing.There exists a considerable body of theorizing and experimentation about thenotion of planning and decision making relevant to discourse production. In theirclassic book about plans, Miller, Galanter, and Pribram 1960 established a connection between planning and linguistic productionthough, of course, stillformulated in terms of abstract generativetransformational grammars. AfterMiller, Galanter, and Pribram 1960, the notion of a plan was generallyadopted in the psycholinguistics of speech production, both at the syntactic leveland for the articulatory execution Fodor, Bever,  Garrett, 1974 Clark  Clark,1977. Clark and Clark 1977228ff. also discuss discourse plans, in whichthey treat mainly conversational turn taking and descriptions.The development of AImodels of language processing, though also biasedtoward understanding the computer can hardly be expected to say something byitself, allows a more constructive approach to language and discourseprocessing. Programs can be and are designed to simulate the steps involved inproduction, for instance, in the task of question answering Lehnert, 1980b.The recent interest within both artificial intelligence and psychology in therepresentation of knowledge and beliefs is beginning to make feasible the muchneeded study of initial structures in the process of production. If language usersform, formulate, and express some idea, such an idea will come from their264knowledge or beliefs. We know something about the structure of this idea, weknow how to represent it, how to retrieve it from memory, and therefore we arefinally able to go beyond informal intuitions in the study of language production.The growing insight into the role and mechanism of both episodic and shortterm memory helps us to specify further the basic features of initial internalrepresentations as well as the shortterm memory constraints on production. Thatis, what we have learned from comprehension processes about the limitations ofthe shortterm buffer must also hold for production processes. From thisperspective it is nearly trivial to state that it is impossible for a language user tofirst construct a long sequence of propositions which will then constitute theinput to the surface structure formulators.From this last point the notion again emerges that a strategic approach toproduction is imperative There exists a flexible mechanism which at the sametime constructs semantic representations, lexical expressions, and their syntacticand phonological structures, taking into account various kinds of information,such as knowledge, goals, local and global constraints at various levels, andother contextual information of the communicative setting.Thus, even if we still know little about production processes, our insight intomore general or comparable cognitive mechanisms allows us to make plausibleguesses about the principles of production and to develop a number ofhypotheses and experimental techniques to test these. In the next sections we willsingle out some of these hypotheses for closer inspection.8.2. INTERACTIVE AND PRAGMATICPRODUCTION STRATEGIES8.2.1. ActionsThe production of discourse should first of all be seen as the planning andexecution of various actions as part of the social and cultural management ofcommunicative interaction. A full account of the planning and executionstrategies of action and interaction would require a separate monograph here wecan only mention some of their basic principles. Zammuner 1981, whoseconcept of cognitive maneuvers is akin to our strategies, has provided a moredetailed account which is highly compatible with the suggestions we are makinghere.As discourse production involves the planning of actions and interactions, thetheory of actions is directly relevant to our discussion. We have reviewed therelevant notions from action theory in Chapter 3 and do not want to repeat thisdiscussion here. However, we shall briefly reintroduce some crucial terms.We need to distinguish between the observable properties of actions and theproperties of the cognitive representations of actions. Actions have consequencestheir goals. Actions are represented cognitively as intentions, and their goals aspurposes. Goals are constrained in that they must be consistent with the motivations265of the agent his or her wishes, wants, preferences, knowledge about possibleactions. Purposes are based on this motivational system.Usually we are not concerned with a single action but with action sequencesas well as with rnacroactions. Plans are the cognitive representations of globalactions. Strategies play a role because we not only want to achieve global goals,but want to do so in an effective manner.Against this theoretical background, we can begin our discussion of thestrategic processes involved in discourse production.8.2.2. The Strategic Planning of ProductionFirst we need a strategy for deciding whether a desired change in a situationcan and should be brought about by some action. A next strategy will analyze thepossible actions of the agent the abilities, the possible alternatives, andestimated effectiveness of these alternatives with respect to the realization ofsome global goal. Thus, if we do not want another person to take a trip to Italy,for example, because we will miss that person too much or are concerned abouthis or her health, we will in general not prevent him or her from going byapplying bodily force, but will have recourse to verbal interaction, such as aletter or a conversation. That is in most cases where the interpretation andreasons for our own actions are not obvious from nonverbal actions alone,discourse will be involved, taken as an inherent part and form of socialinteraction. Yet, we have many possible discourses that may ultimately have theeffect that some listener will not go to Italy. We may warn someone, request orcommand, or just affirm that we do not like it. That is, as part of the complexsystem of interaction, people will form concepts of verbal macroactions, that is,plans for global speech acts. It is exactly at this point where the actual productionof discourse begins, given a representation of the situation, of the action context,of ones own motivations and goals. Macroplanning is a feature of productionthat has been neglected in the sentence production literature. Whereas the notionof speech act planning does occur see, e.g., Clark  Clark, 1977, the formationof macroplans was hardly discussed, although in our opinion it is one of the basicplanning and control aspects of production. Butterworth 1980164 mentionsmacroplans but fails to identify them precisely, either in semantic or pragmaticterms. Van Dijk 1980a gives more details on macroplanning of discourse.A plan may be formed to change the situation in the desired direction, and thisplan may be the global representation of a macro speech act. The strategy used inthe choice and local execution of such a speech act will first of all involve a morespecific analysis of the situation. If the listener is a friend, commands are out. If wedo not want to exhibit our own wishes or wants too much, requests may be toodirect. If we are concerned about the wellbeing of our speech partner, a suggestion,advice, or warning may be more appropriate. Hence, the formation of a pragmaticmacroplan depends on a systematic scanning of the situation for those featuresthat determine the possible and effective use of a speech act, such as to advise,suggest, or warn. For our purposes we will assume that this pragmatic plan controls266the rest of the production process. This control is strategic Sometimes possiblecomponent actions willon the basis of knowledge and experiencebe derived topdown from this global plan on the other hand, actual actions will be evaluatedconstantly in order to see whether the change in the situation is or will bepossible according to ones purpose. Similarly, various kinds of information willbe admitted to the strategy Sociocultural constraints, analyses of ones ownmotivation or that of the listener, as well as the semantic and surface structuresof the ongoing discourse will be given as input to the strategy. The actualandchangingstate of the hearer, crucial in order to bring about the desired change ofknowledge, beliefs, opinions, and their possible action consequences as decided,planned, and executed by the hearer in the same way as described above will bemonitored by parallel analysis of his or her doings, that is, intended actions andnonconscious activities, such as nonverbal communication gestures, facialexpressions, and so on. The result of this monitoring will provide the necessaryfeedback information for the system of discourse production. Given all thisinformation and its analysis by the speaker, decisions may be made about themore specific content and surface structures as well as about the actual executionof the discourse.It should be stressed at this point that the strategic planning of speech acts atthis global levelusing the various kinds of cognitive and contextual informationdescribed heredoes not yield pragmatic information. That is, it is not likely thata language user will decide to use advice or a warning independent of thesemantic content of the discourse. Macro speech acts also have a globalpropositional content, that is, a macroproposition. This macroproposition is alsoderived from the analysis of the interaction context and its cognitivecounterparts. The conclusion I do not want her to go to Italy, which may be theinput to the discourse production system as a whole and determine the choice ofthe most appropriate and effective global speech act, also yields the theme ortopic of the discourse, and hence the macrostructural content for the globalspeech act. Again, we see that strategies have variable, fragmentary input,flexible operations, and multiple outputs. We now have two closely relatedmacrostructures, formed during interaction, for the further formation of theactual discourse, namely, a pragmatic plan and a semantic plan, for instance, Iam giving her advice and She should not go to Italy. Together with furthercognitive and contextual information about the listener and the ongoing speechsituation, this very specific discourse plan will be the hierarchical schema thatcontrols the local, linear, that is, lower, levels of discourse production.What we have described here is an idealization. Actual behavior in languageproduction may sometimes come close to this idealization, especially in writing andwith difficult texts, where conscious, orderly planning is almost a necessity. Ordinarily, discourse plans will be much more sketchy, more vague, and not necessarily conscious at all. In many types of conversation the control is almost entirelylocal and data driven The plan may be no more than a general decision to keep upthe conversation. Even in writing we observe similar phenomena in some of thepoorer essays or chapters we have to read which jump from one random thought tothe next, or in certain types of literary prose where the discourse plan affects only267some very high level of organization and is well hidden from the reader. We donot claim that the picture we have presented of careful, deliberate discourseplanning accurately depicts what people do. At present, however, our need is toexplore theoretically via our intuitions as we do here, and eventually alsoexperimentally. what people can do and how discourse production works in suchidealized, simplified situations.8.2.3. Discourse PlansThe execution of a global speech act is, in all respects, a strategic enterprise.There is an overall goal, and it is the task of the speaker to strategically bring abouta change in accordance with this goal on the basis of continuously fluctuating localinformation. In other words, the choice of local speech acts is not only determinedby the macro speech act, but also by the previous speech acts and the reaction tothese of the hearer. Especially in nondirected everyday conversation the hearer isable to influence fundamentally the pragmatic and semantic plans of the speaker,such that even these global plans may be changed during speaking. If our globalplan is to invite somebody to go to the movies with us, then local information fromthe hearer may be such that we give up this plan before its full execution. Thus, aglobal plan will depend on local information for its effective execution. Eachresponse from the hearer will require its own reaction from the speaker because eachlocal speech act must be defined with respect not only to the overall speech act butalso to the local action context. The strategy involved must therefore be that aspeaker tries to effectively reach his or her goal while taking into account thislocal information.Subject to these local constraints, the central strategy remains to successivelyrealize the subgoals that may lead to the final, overall goal. Here we meet theinverse of those operations encountered in the previous chapters. Whereas macrostrategies are operations that derive macrostructures from local information bydeletion, generalization, and constructionfor both semantic and pragmatic structureswe now expect global information to be specified for the local levels. Thatis, details are added, general statements are particularized, and complex actions areanalyzed into their respective components. Typical, for instance, is the execution of aseries of preparatory, component, and terminating speech acts. If, for the execution of a global speech act, prior information about the hearers state of mind isnecessary, then a number of preparatory speech acts will be executed. Some ofthese will have a purely ritual function, that is, defining how speech interaction isinitiated in such encounters. Thus, greetings, questions about mutual health, and soon, will typically open everyday conversations between speech partners who meetafter a certain period of time. Genuinely preparatory speech acts are those thatestablish the mutual information for the speech participants relative to their respective goals. Such interactional planning has been discussed by Clark and Clark1977, Beattie 1980, and Castelfranchi and Parisi 1980.Thus, if we do not want somebody to go to Italy, we might first of all, in a state268of epistemic uncertainty, try to ascertain whether the hearer is indeed planning togo, for example, by such questions as Are you still planning to go to Italy thissummer The most direct strategy, but often not a very wise one if one knows thatthe hearer really likes going there, would simple be to directly state the adviceWell, dont go. Of course, this will usually be insufficient, because the speakerknows that the hearer will want to have good reasons. Thus, the speaker will try toestablish those grounds by making a number of statements so that the hearer mayknow what the disadvantages are of going to Italy. If these are disadvantages forthe speaker e.g., that the speaker will miss the hearer, then a request would bemore appropriate than advice. For the advice it should be shown that the actionwould have unwanted consequences for the hearer. Hence, assertions will bemade to spell out such consequences hot weather if the hearer does not like heat,many tourists if the hearer is known to dislike touristy places, work that will notbe finished if the hearer has work to finish, and so on. At this local level, it maythen be the case that each of these strategic points made by the speaker needs itsown justifications. That is, the assertion It is very hot there during the summermay be challenged by the hearer and may need to be backed up, for examplewith the further assertion In Sicily temperatures during the summer are usuallybetween 30 and 40 C. We see that even at the local level strategies may benecessary to make a relevant move, to change the knowledge or opinion of thehearer about a particular point. One such step may in some cases extend to a fullembedded discourse, like a story. For our example, this would be a story by thespeaker about his or her personal experiences during a summer vacation in Italy.The evaluation and the coda of such a story, giving the emotional and thepragmatic conclusion of the narrative, then provide, in an indirect way, theassertion that is meant to influence the opinion of the hearer about this aspect ofgoing on a vacation to Italy. This is a proper rhetorical device for the strategicspecification of speech acts at the local level The assertive claim is the same, butthe persuasive function, and hence the effectiveness which defines the strategy,may be considerably different. That is, here we typically have added informationwhich, as such, is not relevant my experiences need not be relevant for yourvacation plans, but which may provide more interesting, better groundedpremises for the general conclusion. Gazdar 1980 has described morecompletely such surface manifestations of underlying pragmatic conditions.It should be noticed that also a strategic use may be made of the global orlocal advice speech act itself If the speaker for some reason wants to dissimulatehis or her own preferences, then a direct request grounded with I dont like itmay not be powerful enough. In that case, a strategy aiming at establishing abelief that not going is for the benefit of the hearer may be more effective. Thisstrategy is so common in everyday interaction that speakers sometimes are noteven aware of it themselves. It is wellknown in therapeutic practice, forinstance, that people learn to recognize these strategies during their interactionwith others, especially in those cases where they may lead to interpersonalconflicts.The successive local speech acts have a preparatory function so that often itwill not even be necessary to accomplish the main speech act in a conversation269because the hearer already knows what the overall goal of the speaker is. That is,often the overall speech act will be indirect, leaving the possible overallinterpretation to the hearer. This apparent freedom of the hearer to assign his orher own interpretation to the global action of the speaker also has strategicrelevance It seemingly leaves open the possibility of drawing other conclusionswithout appearing to be uncooperative. Such strategic games people play neednot be spelled out here They are well known from the sociological literature onstrategic interaction. For our own discussion it means that under the generalcontrol of an overall goal, speakers will plan and execute local actions that takeinto account the final state of previous actions as well as the wishes, wants,preferences, and beliefs of the hearer and which respect the more generalprinciples of cooperative interaction.In monological discourse, such as in a lecture, a scholarly article, or a newsstory, the specification of global speech acts is, of course, less dependent on thedirect interaction with the hearer or reader. Yet, speakers or writers willimplicitly take into account possible objections of the hearerreader and specifymatter, in such a way that these are taken care of first.Another difference between the monological and the dialogical forms of discourse planning is that in written monological discourse, planning mm he moreconscious, more explicit, and its execution better controlled by the overall plan.In everyday conversation, a speaker may have such an overall plan, but theinformation from or about the hearer may be such that the plan must be changed,or the local speech interaction may be such that the speech partners get lost in alocal interchange. Thus, speakers may forget the overall plan and will typicallysay things like What was I talking about, What did I want to ask, etc. Or,local goals may suddenly take over and dominate the rest of the conversation.Thus. In our Italy example a long argument may develop about theunpredictability of the wather or ways to cope with a hot climate. For a speaker itmay suddenly become more important to defend his or her credibility on somepoint of assertion than to execute the original global speech act. Henceconversations will in general be more locally conditioned than the production ofwritten discourse.Finally, it should be noted that the ultimate goal of verbal interaction is nospeak or write in such a way that the knowledge, beliefs, or opinion, of the hearerare transformed according to the wishes of the speaker, often with the further goalthat the hearer will act on that basis according to the wishes of the speaker. Thisperlocutionary aspect of speech acts and interaction requires permanent analysis ofthe assumed state of the knowledge, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, and emotion, ofthe hearer. Similarly, an assertion or opinion, or the conditions for an action willonly be acceptable if they are coherent with the information in these cognitivesystems. If this is not obviously the case, the speaker must choose a strategy ofcognitive coherence establishment, either by specifying the coherence link or byfirst changing the other information. For the establishment of more or less superficial knowledge, beliefs, or opinions, the argumentative specification of new facts or acorrection showing the incoherence may be sufficient if the new information isdefensibly well grounded. It is well known from the social psychological literature,270however, that more fundamental beliefs, opinions, or attitudes cannot thus bechanged logically They will need additional and more varied, persuasiveinformation. The strategy in that case will preferably be to show that what isproposed is still coherent with these more fundamental ideas, or that even morebasic beliefs and attitudes require a change in the specific ones to make theinformation acceptable. n our Italy example, we may appeal to the rather centralvalue that one should do ones duty when it is argued that some project, say,should be finished first before one takes a vacation in Italy. Instead ofestablishing a coherence link with other beliefs or opinions, the speaker hereshows that some proposition, for example, I want to go to Italy is incoherentwith these beliefs and opinions and should therefore be changed. As soon as thespeaker recognizes that the main goal, namely, that of dissuasion, cannot bereached, a more modest goal can be set up e.g., going to Italy only for a shorttime. That is, if there is a conflict of interests, the compromise strategy will befollowed.The amount of information processed in the production of a global speech actis enormous. When we then realize that the choice of a particular speech acttogether with its content and its stylistic surface structures must depend on allthis information and still be planned within fractions of a second, the conclusionmust again be that without powerful mechanisms of organization, reduction,higher level control, and especially expedient and fast strategies, this task cannotbe accomplished with the available informationprocessing resources. In the nexttwo chapters we will examine in more detail what the consequences are for thecognitive model that is to accommodate this great amount of informationprocessing. Here we have argued that discourse production, first of all, is theproduction of some global speech act, and that the goals of this act are controlledby the overall goals of the interaction in a given communicative context and bythe norms and values of the actual subculture. The global speech act thencontrols the production of local speech acts, namely, by a number ofspecification operations that generate necessary preparatory and componentspeech acts. The definite choice of such speech acts depends on local pragmaticcoherence constraints and the features of the actual local action context. Part ofthis action context is the set of beliefs we have about the actual knowledge,beliefs, interests, opinions, or attitudes of the hearer. The strategy followed, then,is first to realize the subgoals that contribute to the realization of the global goal.Depending on the situation and the cognitive set of the hearer, a speaker maychoose an, elaborate but perhaps too complex strategy, with the risk of losing thehearers interest or of getting trapped in side arguments, or, alternatively, a moredirect, but riskier, strategy. This strategic choice will depend not only on theimportance of the realization of the goal or on the cognitive state of the hearer,but also on more general principles of interaction, such as politeness, frankness,openness, honesty, and so on. In other words, a permanent strategic choice mustbe made between an optimal realization of ones goals and an optimalconfirmation of ones social esteem. The interaction and pragmatic productionstrategies are summarized in Figure 8.1.2712728.3. SEMANTIC PRODUCTION STRATEGIESUnlike most accounts of production processes, we began our discussion withthe production of speech acts as they are accomplished by the utterance ofdiscourse in social contexts. That is, according to the views of most interestinglinguistic theories, language and discourse are not merely seen in terms of formsand their meanings, but primarily in terms of social interaction, upon whichsyntax and semantics are functionally dependent. This means that meaningproduction and its surface expression should not be viewed as an autonomousprocess. And, indeed, we have seen that at both the local and the global level,semantic representations are constructed as the content for the speech act of adiscourse. Similarly, surface structures, such as those accounted for byphonology, morphology, and syntax, are not only expressions of underlyingmeaning but may directly express pragmatic and other interactional featurese.g., Gazdar, 1980 Givon, 1979b. In technical terms this implies that wecannot merely have a pragmatic component which yields information as input forthe semantic component, which in turn yields information that is the input for thesyntactic component, and so on. Certain conditions of speech acts and theirappropriateness may be directly expressed in intonation, emphatic particles,word order, or gestures. Thus, our conceptual analysis of the production processin terms of various subcomponents should not be viewed as a representation ofthe successive phases of production. On the contrary, our strategic approachstresses the fact that interactional, pragmatic, semantic, and surface structureinformation may closely cooperate in the production process. This also holds forthe semantic aspects of production. Semantic strategies may have pragmatic,contextual, surface structural, and epistemic i.e., knowledgedependentstructures as their input.Semantic production strategies should be accounted for in terms that aresimilar to those of discourse comprehension. Basically, we assume that semanticmacrostructures a topic or theme are formed and that semantic representationsfor the respective sentences of a discourse are construed under the control ofthese macrostructures. In other words, the semantic macrostructure of a discoursemay be viewed as a global semantic production plan. At least for more complex,written discourse types, this view is intuitively appealing When we produce adiscourse, we will know what it is about in global terms before we start toproduce the first sentence. In rather free discourse types, such as spontaneouseveryday conversation, such a semantic plan may be less obvious or evennonexistent for the conversation as a whole. In that case, several loosely relatedtopics may exist in successive order. The topic for such conversation episodesmay be construed more or less continuously. Yet, even then the speechparticipants need to know, in order to contribute coherently to the conversation,what the actual topic of such an episode is. So, the basic principles of semanticproduction also are assumed to hold for such discourse types, with the provisionthat the plan may have a more local, less stable. and more interactioncontrollednature.2738.3.1. Strategies for the Semantic MacrostructureThe strategic interpenetration of pragmatics and semantics has beendiscussed in the previous section. In order to construct a pragmatic plan for theexecution of a global speech act, a language user must generate at the same timea macrostructure which constitutes the content of this global speech act. We donot simply generate the idea of wanting to produce a warning or a requestwithout at the same time generating the propositional content of such a globalspeech act.This topic must be construed from information in memory. More specifically,we assume that the information that constitutes the possible topic for a discourseresides in episodic memory. Most discourses are not about our general semanticknowledge, but rather about more specific, particular experiences with persons.objects, actions, or events. Perhaps only in textbooks, encyclopedias, or otherdidactic discourse forms, does the topic production depend mainly on longterm.general knowledge and beliefs. Our knowledge about your going to Italy thissummer has a more episodic nature, and therefore we should look for the originsof topic formation in the episodic representation of our knowledge of the world.The same is true for our knowledge, beliefs, opinions, or wants with respect towhat the hearer should know, believe, or do as a result of our discourse. Hence,under the control of interactional and pragmatic information, defining the goalsof the discourse, the language user will select from episodic memory a topic forthe discourse. Such a topic may be directly read off from what we know, as whenwe want to give information, or else may be construed from conceptual units thatare otherwise represented. That is, taking again our earlier example, we may nothave a proposition such as I do not want you to go to Italy, but perhaps only theproposition John is going to Italy this summer, and some opinion related to thisfact. Only in the process of expressing this opinion through textualcommunication is the relevant macroproposition formed.In order to better dissociate the episodic information in memory from theactually planned macrostructure, we should carefully distinguish between thesetwo types of semantic or conceptual information. By a semantic macrostructurewe understand the propositional structure that will actually be expressed throughthe sentences of the text and their meanings, whereas the episodic information isin principle language and discourse independent It may also be expressed byother means, for example paratextually or by nonverbal communication, or notbe expressed at all. In this sense, it is only a form of protosemanticrepresentation It forms the information from which semantic macrostructuresare construed. We will simply refer to it as episodic information. In Chapter 10we will give further arguments for this distinction between textual and otherforms of semantic information in episodic memory.The precise strategies underlying the formation of semantic macrostrueturescan only be speculated about at this moment. It cannot simply be said that one ormore arguments, such as persons or objects, are selected for attention and that someglobal property, event, or action is then predicated of these. This may be the case,274but more often than not what is really interesting from a communicative point ofview is to state or ask, request, order, etc.  something new and interesting likeyour vacation in Italywhich would emphasize instead the production priority ofpredicates. We may even talk about vacations in general, thereby changing thepossible participants. There does not seem to be a general strategy that holds forall forms of topic production Sometimes it will primarily be a concept for aperson or object, or a concept for a property, relation, event, or action, whereasoften the combination of some thing or object and some property or event will beselected as a whole. It will, however, be assumed that only the full propositionalstructure thus generated may be the input for macrostructure formation for aparticular discourse.Propositions that are possible candidates for a macrostructural role indiscourse production need not occur as such in episodic memory they might firstneed construction. Such a construction process may involve a proper derivationof a more global proposition from more detailed information in memory Wemay have bits and pieces of experiences which hitherto had not been unified bysome higher level proposition. We may observe or undergo some action or event,and understand these locally, without realizing that we were part of a hold up, aseduction, or a revolution. Coherent discourse production may force alanguage user to first organize such partial experiences into some more globalrepresentation, so that the discourse about them has some clearly identifiabletopic. During everyday spontaneous conversation this global interpretation mayoccur at the same time as, or even somewhat later than, the respective productionsteps.8.3.2. Strategies for the MicrostructureImportant for a cognitive model of discourse production are, of course, thestrategies involved in the specification of such macrostructures, as derived fromepisodic information, into the respective semantic representations of thesentences of the discourse. In other words, we have here a linearization problemWe have some global topic, but must start somewhere and continue coherently.Once this problem has been solved, the speaker or writer can have recourse tofamiliar and even automatized strategies for expressing these semanticrepresentations in surface forms.As we have assumed in the previous section for the specification strategies ofpragmatic macrostructures, we will also assume here that, basically, semantic production depends on the application of inverse macrooperations. That is, givensome macroproposition for a discourse as a whole, information will be added,particularized, and analyzed. The resulting propositions may still be fairly generaland may need further applications of the same processes. That is, talking about ourvacation in Italy, we may particularize the concept of Italy by giving the placeswe visited, and analyze the actions into preparatory, component, and consequentactions, such as taking a train to Rome or visiting some museum or participatingin a political event. At that point we may add details drawn directly from episodic275memory, even if these are irrelevant for the rest of the storyfor instance, that wehad the best ice cream in Florence.If specification operations are indeed some form of inverse macrooperationsthey can be formulated in a rather straightforward way enumerate elements fromsets, analyze actions into component actions, particularize general predicates,and so on. Yet, this is only one aspect of the complex strategy of going fromtopic to subtopic and from there to individual semantic representations. What wealso need, as part of the linearization problem, is an appropriate order for thesesemantic representations. That is, we should effectively construct a relevanttextbase for the discourse. The ordering problem for information in discourse hasreceived some attention, for example, in the literature on descriptions Linde andLaboy 1975 see Clark  Clark, 1977232, for a summary, Levelt 1982, andJarvella and Klein 1982. Levelt 1982 also interestingly mentions the medievaland classical rhetorical notions of ordering, such as the relations betweenworld and discourse ordering. Here we extend the notion of ordering to allrelevant levels u1 discourse production.Ordering strategies differ from one discourse type to another. For instance, anews story will begin with some rather general, summarizing information,directly actualizing part of the macrostructure as the first part of the text, afterwhich the specifications are given. In normal stories we will begin with detailsabout location, place, participants, and their properties. In literary narrative wemay begin in medias res, that is, with the specification of the complication of thestory. Hence we see that a first constraint on ordering is determined by theschematic superstructure. In the previous chapter we have seen that such acanonical or transformed schema may be construed or retrieved from memory. Inthe formation and specification of macrostructures the schema will act not onlyas a further organization of the macrostructure, but also as a global form,determining which information come first. For each category of the superstructureschema we may then specify the contents of the relevant episode. Morespecifically semantic are the strategies for ordering semantic information withinepisodes. Both for lower level macrostructures and for the semanticmicrostructures, then, we may have the following ordering strategies1. In the description of processes, events, and actions, follow the naturalorder unless contextual, pragmatic, rhetorical, or cognitive constraints necessitate another order see below. Under the natural order we understandthe ordering of propositions that is parallel to the temporal or conditionalorder of the facts.2. In the description of objects, persons, or states of affairs, follow an orderwhich is from more general to particular, from higher to lower, from sets toelements, from wholes to parts, and so on.3. In the description of whole facts, first specify some minimal description ofdiscourse individuals and then the additional properties or relations of theseindividuals. This is necessary for the appropriate reidentification ofindividuals.2764. Follow the presuppositional structure of the discourse, that is, always firstspecify the facts individuals and their properties or relations presupposed bylater facts described in the discourse.5. It is possible that the ordering strategies 14 can all be expressed as manifestations of more abstract underlying strategies. If the macrostructure isrepresented as a semantic network with propositions as the nodes andrelations among propositions as the connections, general linearization strategies might be formulated on the graph structure, as was done in Levelt1982. The simplest strategy would be to follow a path, if there is one. withspecifications for what to do at choice points, how to handle loops in thenetwork, and how to do all of this within the limitations imposed by humanshortterm memory. The seminal work of Levelt might show us the way to aformal theory of linearization strategies in discourse production.6. If deviations from the natural order, as specified in Strategies  and 2, arenecessary, mark these explicitly, for example, by time, condition, or spatialexpressions from which the hearerreader can reconstruct the natural order.Deviations from natural ordering principles are common, though. They may besummarized under the following categories van Dijk, 1977a1. Cognitive reordering. Often it is not the proper ordering of the facts, butrather our perception, understanding, recognition, evaluation, or production offacts, which is relevant. Under the scope of verbs expressing such mental acts assee, think, remember, dream, understand, etc., the facts may bepresented later than the respective mental facts under whose scope they arepresented.2. Pragmatic reordering. For the appropriate and effective execution ofspeech acts, some semantic information may need to be specified in a differentorder than the natural order, for instance, so as to mark pragmatic relevance.This, in an expression such as Can you please shut the window. It is cold inhere, the specification of a semantic and pragmatic condition comes later, sothat the upshot of the request, which is the main speech act, can be presentedfirst. We will call this a pragmatic primacy strategy. If information is presentedat the end of a text or episode, although properly belonging to an earlier positionin the natural order, we will call this a recency strategy. Whereas primacystrategies are important for the establishment of information that must dominatethe comprehension of later information as such, the lead in a newspaper story,recency strategies arc aiming at better recall due to the specific location of newinformation in episodic memory.3. Rhetorical reordering. Related to pragmatic reordering strategies arethe rhetorical reordering strategies. They do not specifically aim to stresspragmatic relevance, but will in general involve transformations of thenatural or even of the usual textual ordering which aim at greater effectiveness.The esthetic function of reorderings in literary narrative are one example in277kind. Reordering may also be used to enhance suspense in stories such as thefinal identification of the murderer in a detective story.4. lnteractional reordering. Also related to pragmatic reordering strategiesare those ordering strategies that depend on the properties of the communicative and interactional context. For reasons of cooperation, such as politeness,modesty, strategic effectiveness, we may delay necessary information or givelater conclusions first. Thus, in a request for money, we will not usuallyfollow the pragmatic reordering and ask for the money first and then specifyour reasons, but introduce the request with some conditions. Sometimes thisordering may coincide with the natural order or with the cognitive ordering,but this need not be the case Conclusions from argumentation may comefirst if this is interactionally relevant. In general, we expect information thatis probably difficult for the hearer to accept to be presented later in thediscourse assuming a communicative situation in which cooperationprinciples rather than conflict principles are followed.It goes without saying that both the normal ordering strategies and theirsystematic reorderings as determined by cognitive, pragmatic, rhetorical, andinteractional criteria need further specification, discourse analysis, andexperimental verification.Although we now have some elements for an informal model of semanticproduction, featuring specification strategies for semantic macrostructures andordering strategies for local semantic information, the picture is still far fromcomplete. What has remained implicit is the role of knowledge, beliefs, oropinions, both in the speaker and in the hearer as represented by the speaker, aswell as some further consequences of the pragmatic and interactional constraintson discourse production.We know from the model of discourse comprehension that much of the information necessary to understand a text remains implicit, although presupposed bysentences of the text, and that this information is, if necessary, supplied by theepisodic or more general knowledge of the hearer or reader. In the next chapterwe will examine in more detail the strategies applied in using this knowledgeduring discourse processing. In production, however, this means, in general,that a strategy is followed according to which all information directly known tothe hearer need not be explicitly expressed, although indications of itspresupposed nature may be necessary to signal its role in understanding. Thesame holds for obvious inferences for such knowledge items. In principle,then, only new information must be giveneither in assertions or in otherspeech act contexts. This newness, to be sure, applies to full facts, not toindividuals or their properties as such That is, we may tell a story aboutpeople we already know, or tell known events or actions about persons we donot know, and so on. Also, in order to be able to introduce these new facts,some known propositions may be explicitly stated in order to place informationor to recall these known facts to the hearer. We know or may infer that peopleusually open doors in order to enter a house, but a story may still mention the278fact that Peter opened the door, first of all, to specify the instantiated fact of amore general knowledge script, and second, in order to describe at least somefeatures of what was going on, so that the hearer knows where we are indescription of the sequence of facts. Again, discourse analysis and psychologicalexperiment will be necessary in order to establish how much of the directlyavailable or inferable knowledge must be at least or at most presented in a text.This variation will depend on context e.g., knowledge about the hearersknowledge, the discourse type, or the rhetorical effectiveness of the discourse.We will return in somewhat more detail to this issue in the next chapter.8.4. STRATEGIES FOR ESTABLISHINGLOCAL COHERENCEIn this and the next section we will briefly turn to a series of more specificstrategies for the semantic production of discoursethose determining the localcoherence of the text base. We have examined some strategies that specify thesemantic information of the discourse and its ordering principles in the textbaseunder the control of contextual information and of pragmatic and semanticmacrostructures. We have seen that the knowledge that the hearer is assumed tohave plays an important role in the decisions about what information to leaveimplicit and what information to include in the discourse. Although we thus havea first idea of what to put into a textbase and in which approximate order, we stilldo not know how the various propositions of the textbase are semanticallyrelated by the speaker. That is, once a proposition is produced, there are severeconstraints on the production of the next proposition. What are these constraintsIn other words, what are the precise expansion strategies for textbasesLet us assume, first of all, that a speaker selects from the more or less orderedset of information as it is stored in episodic memoryand produced under thecontrol of macrostrategies of specificationone proposition, by introducing itinto the shortterm memory buffer. Next, we assume that this proposition will bethe input into the sentence formulation strategies to which we will turn in whatfollows That is, a syntactic form will be construed on the basis of the semanticand pragmatic information as well as lexical and phonological expressions.During these operations, the semantic representation will be kept in the shortterm memory buffer because this information will be necessary in the strategicestablishment of coherence with the next proposition. The easiest strategy wouldthen be to select from episodic memory a proposition that is semanticallycoherent with the proposition already stored in the shortterm memory bufferagain under the control of the macroproposition that is relevant for this episode,also stored in the shortterm memory buffer. This selection strategy for nextpropositions would, for instance, search for a proposition that satisfies thefollowing conditions1. It should be a specification of the same macroproposition.2. It should respect the ordering principles for textbases.2793. It should be conditionally or functionally related to the previousproposition the one already in the shortterm memory buffer.4. It should either feature an identical discourse referent and introduce a newpredicate, or feature the same predicate for different discourse referent. andthe time, location and possible world should be identical or be explicitlychanged.Once found, a proposition satisfying these conditions will also be added m theshortterm memory buffer and then given to the sentence formulationmechanism. Part of the coherence conditions may explicitly instruct thismechanism to express surface structure signals, such as connectives,pronominalization or proverb production, definite articles, tense and locationmarking, definite articles or demonstratives, and so on.Although this direct search strategy for coherent propositions does not seembasically wrong, it is still too structural and not strategic enough. It may be thecase that the next proposition does not occur readymade in episodic memory atall. At least for some production processes we should rather assume that the nextpreposition is construed in shortterm memory, out of information which indeedis in episodic memory, but under the control of the semantic structure of theactual proposition and of the relevant semantic and pragmatic macrostructures.It may even be the case that there is a feedback from the surface structure of theactual proposition as it is sententially expressed. This construction hypothesis forcoherence establishment during production is more flexible than the directactualization hypothesis. Given a proposition like John went to Italy thissummer as the first proposition with a more or less macrostructural function ofa story, we may, of course, directly actualize a stored proposition such as Johnhad an accident in Rome, but we may also construct a next proposition such asJohn didnt like it, because he had an accident, in which the first propositionmay not directly occur in episodic memory at all, but rather is now constructedon the basis of a knowledge determined inference People who are involved inaccidents do not like them. In other words, a more active construction strategyallows the speaker to start from given information in the shortterm memorybuffer, such as a concept for a discourse referent, and then combine relevantinformation in episodic memory with world knowledge and assumptions aboutthe knowledge, beliefs, interests, and goals of the hearer. If we merely actualizedour readymade episodic memory information, we would be unable to strategicallymodify it so as to make it relevant for the actual local context of production.Also, we should assume that a speaker will sometimes suddenly realizeimplications or associations of a currently produced proposition which were notin episodic memory but which are also currently inferred. Another argument forthe construction hypothesis for local coherence establishment is the sentenceformulation mechanism. Instead of having a full new proposition ready forexpression, a speaker may start, strategically, with the first noun phrase,functioning as subject and topic of the next sentence, without yet knowingexactly which new information, in the form of a predicate phrase, and functioningas comment of the next sentence, should be actualized from episodic memory.280Hesitation phenomena after initial pronouns or other topical noun phrasesseem to indicate that even during production of next sentences semanticinformation is still sought for in episodic memory. This is in accordance with thecomprehension strategy which already begins to interpret the noun phrase at thebeginning of nest sentences.8.5. PROPOSITIONAL PRODUCTION STRATEGIESThe establishment of local coherence during discourse production takesplace, as we have seen in the previous section, by a number of strategiesregulating the retrieval or construction of subsequent propositions on the basis ofepisodic information, and under the control of a macroproposition, the currentspeech act, and other contextual information relevant for the present localproduction process. This means that the production of meaning is not simply theactualization of proposition, from memory, to be expressed via the sentenceformulation mechanism.In general, each proposition must be constructed under textual and contextualconstraints of coherence and relevance, and only seldom do such propositionsoccur readymade in episodic memory. Both semantically and pragmatically theprimary goal of discourse is to say something about reality or to affect it in aparticular way. Hence, we may have concepts about this reality in memory, forexample, concepts of persons, objects, places, events, or actions we know about.Presumably, these fragments of episodic knowledge about reality organize intoschematic clusters, say, around persons or events. To be able to express thisknowledge, or our beliefs or opinions about them, the conceptual richness thatmay be used to refer should somehow be fixed. That is, particular meanings mustbe selected that specify the particular properties of a person, object, or event. Wemay have a lot of knowledge about the concept John, but when we want torefer to John through the expression of a discourse term, we need to usemeaningful expressions, such as brother, lawyer, crook, or pronouns. In otherwords, during the production of propositions, a language user must select aspecific meaning which is coherent and relevant with respect to text and context.It seems difficult to specify just one type of strategy for this kind of textuallyand contextually bound formation of propositions. The canonical form of aproposition, reflecting the abstract structure of a fact in some possible world, is,of course, only an approximate schema for the strategies involved. It tells us howto complete a proposition once initiated with one of its concepts, but it does notsay where to start the construction of the propositional frame. However, despitethis still rather obscure aspect of textual meaning production, there are somesuggestions for strategic effectiveness. In fact, surface structures provide us withclues regarding this kind of underlying semantic strategy. Thus, it is well knownthat the canonical topiccomment structure of many languages has a strategicvalue It suggests how language users go about linking new information, or nowactualized or relevant information, with old, previously actualized, information.281Against this background, therefore, we will assume that the basic strategy fortextual meaning production consists in the selection of one or more arguments, towhich a series of predicates are systematically applied. These arguments w illusually be discourse referents such as persons or objects, and the predicates willusually be properties or relations between these persons or objects. For eachsubsequent proposition of a textbase, the strategy is to start the new propositionschema with the already actualized individual concept. Thus this concept hastopic function, and is in many languages also expressed as the first noun phrase,often as a subject, of the next sentence expressing this proposition. The next step,then, is to retrieve the predicate denoting the property or relation in which thisgiven argument is involved. This predicate is associated with a propositionalschema or predicate frame, which provides the typical participants and their rolesassociated with the predicate. It these other participants were not introducedbefore, they must then be introduced, either explicitly or implicitly. If one ormore of the other participants was already introduced, the predicate merely givesthe relation holding between them.A next aspect of the strategy of proposition production is to follow somepreferred order. That is, certain participant roles are reviewed first. If thediscourse referent is a human being, first its role as an agent will be preferred inproduction. Hence, sentence topics will often be, not only subjects of sentences,but also agents or causes of the predicate schema. If they are no longer agents,then two strategies are possible Another agent may be introduced so that theprevious agent can become, for instance, patient alternatively, the discoursereferent remains topic, and hence is introduced first to establish strategiccoherence, but his different role is specifically signaled through differentpronouns, intonation, or prepositions, as in John went to Italy last summer. Hewas surprised by the vast numbers of tourists.Finally, the state of affairs, action, or event thus propositionally producedmust be situated, that is, put into some possible world, time, and location,sometimes, accompanied by specific conditions. Again, there are severalpossible strategies, here, depending on context. In case the possible world,time, and location are known i.e., previously introduced or known fromcontext, these parameters may remain implicit or are only signaled marginally,as by the verb tense or a proadverb. If introduced they will typically be specifiedlast, in the preprositional complements of the sentence. If an explicit change ofpossible world, time, or location is necessary, this will preferably take place first,and in the surface structure this strategy will exhibit itself in preposed adverbialphrases The next day . . . , Somewhat later . . . , Maybe . . ., etc.These strategies for proposition production can now be summarized in thefollowing wayand in the order indicatedl. Introduce possible world, time, and locationif these remain constant, keepthem implicit or signal them marginallyif they change, signal the changeexplicitly2. Introduce main participant persons first, agents firstif main participantsalready introduced, signal marginally pronouns2823. Introduce predicate for this participant these participants4. Actualize the typical propositional role schema case structure of thispredicate5. Introduce the other participants in their respective case roles, personsfirst, objects next, and time and location lastOf course, as we suggested before, these semantic strategies in the gradual construction of propositions may show in surface structure Typical word order,intonation, case endings, tense markings, prepositions, etc., will in generalfollow the construction of the schema. That is, the way the speaker graduallybuilds up the sentence should reflect the way he or she also gradually builds theunderlying semantic representation. Characteristic for the strategic approach isthis mingling of phonological, morphological, lexical, syntactic, and semanticstrategies We do not first have a complete proposition which is then given asinput to the surface structure formulators.Also characteristic for a strategy is the fact that there exists a typical,preferred ordering for the construction process, but not a rigid one. According toprinciples already examined in the context of proposition ordering in textbases,we may have specific orderings under the influence of stylistic, rhetorical,cognitive, pragmatic, or interactional factors. However, as hearers must be ableto apply their comprehension schemata, effective communication presupposesthat these deviations be explicitly marked, for example, by different intonation,specific pronouns, case endings, and so on.We will not pursue the analysis of possible production strategies for propositions beyond these few indications. They are outside of the scope of this bookand are being examined in detail in current psycholinguistic studies Clark Clark, 1977 Butterworth, 1980 and Rosenberg, 1977, provide some details.More interesting from our perspective is the distribution problem forpropositions. In Chapter 4 we saw that propositions may have variable degrees ofcomplexity. We may have complex or compound propositions, or a sequence ofpropositions featuring the same set of atomic propositions. Depending on anumber of factors, such as importance or pragmatic relevance, we may haveproposition collapsing or splitting in comprehension. The opposite will takeplace in production. The speaker may have a set of propositions, but during theprocess of production, these may be either split up or combined. That is, aproposition may be inserted into the modifier category for some participant, ormay itself become a participant, typically so in object positions for verbs ofsaying, feeling, thinking. etc. Thus, if for any reason the information of aproposition is relatively important, for semantic, pragmatic, or other contextualreasons, the proposition will either be independent or dominant with respect toother propositions. This is another reason why we cannot simply say thatdiscourse production takes place on the basis of a set of readymade propositions sometimes the propositions should be construed out of other propositionsin memory, and nearly always the speaker must strategically decide how to make283larger or smaller constructions out of propositions. Again, this process ofproposition combination will show in the surface structure, for example, in theclause structure of sentences and the relations between sentences. It follows thatif a proposition contains information about known, presupposed, inferable,stereotypical, relatively unimportant, or other less prominent features of aperson, object, action, or event, this proposition will strategically be downgradedas an embedded proposition in the surface structure, and appear as an adjective,adverb, or relative clause. Similarly, the ordering of propositions will follow theprinciples that also hold for the units within the sentence or proposition Known,previously introduced, presupposed, less relevant, or world, time, or locationintroducing or changing, propositions will come first and in subordinate positionand appropriately marked with connectives While he was driving to New York,John had an accident.8.6. SOME CONSEQUENCES FOR SENTENCEPRODUCTION STRATEGIESProduction strategies for sentential surface structures are beyond the scope ofthis book. Yet the previously discussed strategies of textually dependentproposition and proposition sequence production appeared to be closely linkedalso with surface structure strategies. The main conclusion of what we haveobserved for the respective levels of discourse production is not only that theselevels strategically presuppose each other, but also that many of the underlyingstrategies show up again in surface structure. Of course, this is as it should beThe hearer or reader has tile surface structure to begin with in order to work outthe underlying semantic and pragmatic strategies, and the information from thecommunicative context will not always be sufficient to help. Hence the speakermust organize his or her utterance ill such a way that the hearer receives enoughcues to figure out, not only grammatically or correctly, but also effectively, howthe utterance should be interpreted. Current functional approaches to grammartry to account for sentential structures in the light of this role of the utterance incommunicative interaction Dijk 1978 Givn, 1979b.In fact, the functional dependence of surface structures upon the underlyingsemantic and pragmatic representations and their cognitive and social processingholds not only for sentential surface structures and their production orcomprehension, but also between sentential structures on the one hand andsequential and whole textual structures on the other. Let us briefly summarizesome sentential surface strategies that depend on and determine textualstructures1. Intonation In spoken discourse, sentence intonationcombining elements of stress, pitch, tone, volume, vowel quality, rhythm, and speednot only depends on underlying semantic and pragmatic structures, but284a Sentence and clause boundaries, and hence complex proposition orproposition sequence structureb Initial and final episode boundaries, and hence the onset andtermination of relevant macropropositionsc Locally and sometimes also globally important conceptsd Contrastive meaning2. Word order Besides the typical expression of semantic roles cases,word order may signal the following textual properties see Givn,1979ba Topiccomment structuresb Presuppositional structuresc Change of possible world, time and place parameters whenadverbial, are in first positiond Topic introduction and change, as in extraposition or topicalizationphenomena John, I havent seen him. As for Mary , . . . . etc.e Topic reminders, same but with backwards extrapositionf Discourse topic arguments and sentence topics sentence topics willpreferably be sequential and textual discourse referents importantindividuals3. Definite and indefinite noun phrases As is well known, textual functionsinclude signaling that concepts or individuals referred to are supposed tobe, in the case of definites, known, having been previously introducedin the discourse, or, in the case of indefinites, unknown and nonintroduced.4. Pronouns As in 3, but with the concept still identifiable in the shortterm memory buffer.5. Predicates verbs in general These signal same or different knowledgeframe, hence local and global coherence.6. Verb tenses Indicate same or different time parameters, with respect toprevious propositions, as well as changes in perspective and verb aspectin English or Spanish some languages have special morphologicalstructures for these.7. Emphatic particles as in German doch, ja, halt, etc., and in Dutch andGreek Establish semantic and pragmatic relationships with previous orfollowing sentences, propositions, speech acts, or turns, for example,signaling conclusions, expectations, surprise, etc. Franck, 1980.8. Connectives Express relations between propositions and relations between speech acts, mostly denoting conditional relations between factse.g., cause and consequence.9. Adverbials Express change of time, place, etc. parameters, also forsentence sequencessee also 2c.10. Clausal sentence structure The subordinate and superordinatehierarchical structure of clauses signals presupposition and pragmaticand semantic relevance or importance.285This list is only partial, and for each point the phenomena could be describedin further detail and examples given. For this, however, we refer to the literaturementioned earlier on the phonology and syntax of textually relevant sentencestructures. For our present discussion it is only relevant to recall that during theproduction of sentential surface structures the language user will not simply haverecourse to an autonomous syntax and phonology at nearly each point a decisionmust be made about the semantic, pragmatic, interactional, and textual relevanceof lexical items, word order. intonation, and the presence of certain words e.g..adverbs, connectives, or particles or morphemes. On full analysis there areprobably few surface structure items that are not produced in order to signal asemantic. Pragmatic, cognitive, social, rhetorical, or stylistic function. Thus, atthis level, little is left of the old Saussurian arbitrariness in the relations betweenexpressions signifiers and their meanings signifieds. For production strategiesthis important linguistic fact is crucial Nearly all underlying semantic,pragmatic, etc.  information can be mapped onto surface structures and parallelparatextual action. Cognitively or interactionally important, relevant, previouslyintroduced elements may be produced first either canonically or bytopicalization or extraposition, or given special stress changes in time, place,macroproposition, discourse referent, etc. can be marked directly, and so on.That is, the sentence not only expresses its own meaning but also the multiplelinks it has with the whole text and communicative context. Typical for thestrategic approach, then, is that the surface structure formulator need not waitwith its operation in shortterm memory until the full semantic or pragmaticrepresentation has been formed. Instead, the coherence relations or the cognitiveprominence of semantic units allow the language user to start with adverbials,connectives, or initial noun phrases, signaling sameness or difference of the timeor place parameters, sameness or difference of the individual. arid the overallrelations between the propositions or speech acts. The rest of the sentence willthen fill out the details of this picture precise predicate, other participants, andso on, in decreasing order of importance and closeness to the predicate.The relation between surface structures and their semantic, pragmatic, or interactional functions, on the one hand, and their relevance for cognitiveproduction and production, on the other hand, cannot be too strict. Somelanguages have quite varied surface structures, and it remains to be seen whetherthis will always directly presuppose different comprehension and productionstrategies. For instance, in VSO languages the textual relevance of first nounphrases should have a different aspect, or require processes of topicalization andextraposition, depending on text and context, and the same holds for the fewOVS languages. Note also that in those cases where the main verb comes laste.g., in German or Dutch composite verbs both comprehension and productionsometimes require rather complex shortterm memory processing. Further workregarding these relationships between the functional structures of sentences indifferent languages and their cognitive processing is necessaryespecially takinginto account the textual relevance of these functions.2868.7. SOME PRODUCTION STRATEGIESFOR THE NEWSWEEK TEXTIn our previous analyses of the Newsweek text we gave a semiexplicitsimulation of a number of comprehension strategies, thus modeling thecomprehension of a reader of this text. A simulation of production has a numberof additional problems to solve. We do not have a fullfledged production model,and we can only speculate about the specific strategies involved. We do,however, assume that the basic principles of complex information processingmust be the same in both production and comprehension, and against thebackground of that hypothesis we have formulated a number of productionstrategies. We will try to illustrate some of these in a partial productionsimulation of some fragments of the Newsweek text.A strategic production model for the Newsweek text involves a partial simulation of the author, namely, Newsweeks correspondent in Guatemala City, mentioned at the bottom of the text neglecting the desk editors at the U.S. office ofNewsweek. Furthermore, a journalist does not write his or her article on thebasis of direct knowledge of the situation in Guatemala, but on the basis ofindirect knowledge which is inferred from other discourses, such as governmentreports and press conferences, previous information from the local press, talkswith participants, and so on. In other words, the situation model of the author isitself the result of a large number of textprocessing operations on differentoccasions. This may mean, among other things, that the ultimate stylisticallyrelevant choice of lexical items is not simply based on corresponding concepts ofthe author, but also may reflect lexicalization in these antecedent discourses.8.7.1. Sociocultural StrategiesAs we have emphasized elsewhere, discourse production must be understoodin its sociocultural background. Assuming for the moment that the journalist isan American, it follows that he will participate in the general cultural values,norms. and ideologies of American society, and in those of his professionalgroup in particular. Thus, although not explicitly stated, it must be assumed thatthe murder of thousands of people by the Guatamelan regime is an act that isevaluated negatively according to the norms of the author, and which the authoralso implicitly ascribes to the United States government since he specifies thattherefore the government will be, and has been, in a dilemma whether it shouldback such a regime. On the other hand, he also presumes and participates in anideology about communism, which specifies that communists are not anacceptable alternative group for the assumption of power in Guatemala. We haveshown that the text suggests that the author implicitly accepts this generalideology. Presumably, the readers of the article are expected to share it, too.2878.7.2. Communicative StrategiesWithin the general framework of sociocultural strategies determining, theways the reporter will see, interpret, and evaluate a political situation and hencealso the ways he can be expected to write about it, we have a number of morespecific communicative strategies. The author has a specific communicative task,namely, writing a status report about the situation, in a country which is now onthe interest list of the press. This means that he must write a text that isacceptable to his editors and, ultimately, to his readers.The strategies involved here are general ones, but they dominate, even at thelocal stylistic level, all other production strategies. Some plausible strategic,might be see, e.g., Gans, 1979 Tuchman, 19791. Write about situations and events the editors and readers are interestedin.2. If you write about still unknown situations and events indicate whythese would be interesting for the editorsreaders.3. Separate descriptions of facts and expressions of opinions. If opinionsare described, do so by attributing them to relevant participantsneutrallocal observers, diplomats, or other credible sources.4. Do not only report new events, but also summarize previous events, andspecify the general and actual context as well as the background of thesituation and the events.5. Specify general political situations as much as possible in terms ofconcrete interesting actions of participants sec S7, S12515.6. Specify the political implications of the situation for the U.S., both theU.S. governments policies and U.S. citizens.7. Take the perspective of an outside, neutral observer, and do not sidewhit controversial groups or participants, especially not with those whothreaten basic values, norms, and interests.8. Try to substantiate facts with prooflike statements, such as precisenumbers, credible sources, own observations, etc.9. Assume some but not too much general knowledge of the reader aboutthe country and the political situation there.10. Respect the specific format rules style, length, deadlines. etc.  for thiskind of report.These are just a few examples of general communicative strategies. Some ofthem are specific versions of Grices 1967 cooperation principles, for example,those of relevance, truth, and manner. Our text, taken on the whole, indeedseems to exhibit these strategic principles, as we will see in more detail in whatfollows. The principles explain such features as the description of backgroundsand history typical for weeklies, the frequent citation of diplomats, thenumbers, the specific attention for U.S. participants, the scanty information aboutthe communist guerrillas, the international political implications such as arms288sales, and some perfectly irrelevant but pictorial details such as The President.splane was just preparing for takeoff just as Walters landed S,15.Added to the more general sociocultural strategies of knowledge and beliefmanagement, the communicative strategies provide a finer grid for the desired orexpected kinds of information to be supplied in the text, as well as theperspective and style of reporting these.To provide an explicit cognitive account of how such strategies work is notan easy task, however. Consider the first principle write about interestingevents. which would require a very complex retrieval strategy. Although thepress does have the overall function of agenda setting Gans, 1979 Tuchman,1979, it would be too easy to assume that we just have a corresponding list ofinteresting items. There must be complex evaluation procedures which for anysituation and event yield the information now needed for expression.8.7.3. Pragmatic StrategiesGlobally speaking, a news report will usually and predominantly have thenature of an assertion. This means that the author wants to or must provideinformation which is such that the reader a does not have it all yet, b isprobably interested in having it, and c is likely to believe that it is true. Thisalso holds for the more local speech acts of the text, which also predominantlyare assertions. Only, in that case, it may well be that some facts are alreadyknown by some readers. Hence, assertions may serve as reminders for somereaders and as information for others.Yet, a news report is not only an assertion but may also indirectly function asan advice, suggestion, or recommendation. This advice namely, not to side witha brutal regime in our text is the pragmatic point of the communicativeinteraction, on the one hand aiming at a direct influence on U.S. policy and onthe other hand aiming at the transformation of opinions among the readingpublic about such policy. These overall pragmatic goals provide furtherconstraints on the strategic choices occurring in discourse production.8.7.4. Macrostrategies of ProductionUnder the overall control of the information yielded by the cultural, social.communicative, and pragmatic strategies, the author will be able to effectively planthe text itself. We have assumed that this plan consists of the macrostructure of thetext. The intention to write a report about the actual situation in Guatemala will bethe major argument for the superordinate macroproposition for the text. With thisinformation in the control system, the author will activate his episodic situationmodel about Guatemala. For a journalist on location we assume that such a modelwill be relatively rich. The journalist knows much more than would be relevantto write. Hence, the necessity of the sociocultural, communicative, and pragmaticconstraints It is necessary to select the relevant, interesting, new, and important289information. Relevant in our case are the political relationships between Guatemalaand the United States important is the fact that the actual regime commits massmurders, and that there is a communist guerrilla element and new is the politicaldevelopment as seen in the light of the recent developments in El Salvador. Fromthese constraints, the journalist may indeed form a general macroproposition ofthe type metaphorically expressed by the first sentence of the text Compared tothe moderate situation in El Salvador, the one in Guatemala is much moreextreme. As the situation in El Salvador, extensively reported in the press and inthe same issue of Newsweek, may be presupposed, the main next macrostructuralstep is the description of the situation in Guatemala, specifying why it is muchmore extreme than that in El Salvador. On the basis of general world knowledgeand specific knowledge about Central America, the journalist will therefore nextactivate the necessary semantic components covered by the predicate extreme,namely, extremely opposed political groups and their respective goals andactions. Thus, the next step in the semantic macroplan is to introduce thesegroups, as indeed is the case in the first macropropositions and the firstsentences of the text, and then to give historical background and context aboutthese groups and their relations with the United States. This latter point isespecially important in satisfying the communicative and pragmatic relevancecriterion Macropropositions must be formed in order to organize the variousevents and actions of the relations between Guatemala and the United States.These also will consist of historical backgrounds, context, previous event type,and actual events, as specified by the news schema discussed in the previouschapter. It follows that the overall production plan consists of at least threeinterwoven plans a pragmatic plan, defining the overall speech act a schematicplan, defining the overall ordering, organization, and functional categories of thetext and a macrosemantic plan, providing the overall content.It thus appears that a processing model for discourse production will have toinclude a planning component that is considerably more complex than envisagedb some current theories of writing e.g., the discussion of planning in Hayes andFlower 1980, neglects the distinction between different levels of planning. Byembedding such a model in a more general theory of discourse processing, additional factors and constraints become apparent which are important for an understanding of production processes. It should be stressed that in actual productionsome steps in the formation and execution of these plans may be strategically madeonly during actual writing We do not assume that the journalist already has acomplete triple plan before writing the first sentence, but we do assume that inwriting rather complex texts at least parts of these plans must have been formed. Ifnot, the author would not know what kind of information to retrieve from theepisodic situation model, or what kind of information to present first. Anotherstrategically relevant point is the actual process in activating fragments of thesituation model. Although we may assume that situation models are also hierarchically organized and feature macropropositions to organize the vast amount ofdetailed knowledge we have about situations, it is not necessarily the case that thewriter will access the model only from top to bottom. Some detailed information290may be more relevant, important, interesting, or new, especially within the framework of the overall communicative strategies specified earlier. Thus, although therefusal of Guatemalas president to see Reagans emissary Walters, the role of Israelin the arms sales, or the gruesome act of beheading a large group of peasants may bedetails relative to the overall political situation, and hence relative to the respectivemacropropositions formed, they may nonetheless be interesting enough to guidedirect retrieval. t follows that besides the formation of a semantic macroplan, thejournalist may already have retrieved propositions which satisfy thecommunicative criteria and which he or she therefore wants to report. In thatcase, the formation of local propositions, or larger parts of the actual textbase,will sometimes precede the formation of overarching macrostructures.The semantic formation processes therefore involve the following strategicsteps1. Activate the situation model Guatemala and corresponding semanticmore general information about politics, Central America, and politicalconflicts.2. Activate the situation model about the knowledge of the average reader,and compare with own mode of Guatemala Decide what the readerdoes not yet know.3. Activate or apply the various cultural, communicative, and pragmaticstrategies so that information becomes available which decides whichinformation from the writers situation model satisfies the criteriarelevance, importance, interestingness, newness, etc. of thecommunicative context.4. Form an overall theme or topic for the information that is to becommunicated.5. Activate or apply the news schema and the relevant categories intowhich further, lower level, local and global propositions can be fitted.6. Derive more specific macrostructures from the overall topic, beginningwith those of the initial schematic categories of the text form.7. Keep more detailed propositions in store that is, as parts of a fragmentarytextbase already formed until the relevant macroproposition, episode,and schematic category are executed at the local level.In other words, the formation of the textbase to be expressed takes place fromtop to bottom, although some bottom information may already be available, andthis formation process takes place by reading off the situation model under theconstraints of communicative and pragmatic strategies. Of course, part of thisreading off strategy may be sustained by external memory procedures, such asthe consultation of notes or the sketch for an overall semantic plan for the text.8.7.5. Local Semantic StrategiesConstrained by global communicative, semantic, and pragmatic plans, thewriter will next start to generate specific semantic material for the higher level291categories and topics that have been established. Again the situation model will beaddressed under the constraints of this higher level information. At the same time,the writer will activate at each step general frames and scripts necessary for theunderstanding of local semantic propositions and their connection in the textbase.The formation of the initial propositions of the textbase is a complex strategywhich involves steps such as the following1. Specify the macropropositions with information from the situationwhich satisfies the communicative principles.2. Follow the ordering, in episodes, of the macropropositions asdetermined by the news text schema.3. Use information from previous sentences, and hence the topicComment distribution of semantic information.4. Presuppositional constraints specify participants before specifyingactions of these participants.5. Conditional coherence first specify causes, reasons, or other conditionsof events, then the events, then the consequences of these events.6. Functional coherence respect normal orderings for description, ofcomplex situations, such as generalspecific, abstract instantiation,wholepart, etc.On the basis of such strategies, the writer will perhaps start with a headline,satisfying the text schema and summarizing the main topic. Next, a thematicinitial sentence will be necessary to function as a lead, to be specified in the newsentences. According to schema we then should derive some historicalbackground, context, and previous events, followed by the description of actualevents. The presuppositional constraints determine, among other things, that thetext first mentions the initial joy of the Guatemalan elite about the election ofReagan, followed by a functional explanation of this event, and only then thecauses of the actual disappointment and its consequences. The first step will leadto the formation of propositions, selected from episodic situation models, whichmay be interesting for the reading public. Instead of a rather high levelproposition they were glad about the election of Reagan, the episodic modelmay be inspected for more concrete facts implying this highlevel information,namely, the information about marimba bands and firecrackers, or about thebusiness relations of White House aide Deaver with Guatemala.Of course, the various principles and strategies mentioned earlier still leave alot of freedom in he actual formation of a textbase fragment to be expressed.Thus. the description of the relationships between the Guatemalan regime andthe U. S. diplomats could have come after the description of the mass murdersand the fights with the guerrillas. However, the relevance criterion for newsdiscourse might determine an ordering in which first of all the relations with theUnited States should be given.Note, finally, that in principle each new episode should be initiated with aproposition of a rather high thematic level, after which specifications may follow.292This is indeed the case in our text, except maybe for S7 and S12 which providemore specific details.Whereas the description of actions and events will locally be heavily influenced by conditional ordering, we still ignore the precise ordering in the descriptionof situations, such as political situations. We have indicated some functional principles, but they do not account for all local connections. Thus, is there a constraintsaying that on the left groups should be presented before the on the right groupsIt seems as if for this kind of text, the most powerful production strategy at thelocal level is that of generalspecific relations, where general propositions areoften paragraph initial, thematic ones. In S36 we see that also the assertionargumentationbacking relation may be followed a general assumption followedby facts proving it. And finally, we observe for this text that first some general oractual context or facts are presented, followed at the end of the paragraphs by theopinions or conclusions of spokesmen. Although we herewith have tracked somelocal semantic formation strategies, a lot of descriptive research and experimentsremain to be done to assess the major relevant production strategies at this level.8.7.6. Formulation StrategiesOnce a partial textbase has been formed, the writer will strategically have toformulate sequences of local propositions in actual sentence forms. We cannotdescribe these strategies in detail. We may assume, though, that just as thelanguage user has propositional schemata, he or she also has clause and sentenceschemata to work with in a strategic way. Thus, the semantic relations in thepropositions need to be expressed by specific word order, case endings, andclause hierarchies. At the same time a process of lexicalization will selectappropriate lexical items to express the concepts of the propositions in thetextbase.However, this selection of clause and sentence schemata and the use of lexicalization strategies is not free. First, it is bound by the style register determined bytext type and communicative context The author must use words that belong to therepertoire of news discourse. If not, as in bunch of people in S2, the words occur ina quotation. Next, it may be constrained by rhetorical devices, such as comparisons,metaphors, irony, and fixed expressions, as in the metaphor of S1, kinsman in S8,giving the cold shoulder in S13, and so on. Third, the semantic distribution ofinformation constrains the topiccomment structure of the respective sentences, andhence word order. Similarly, focusing will put important phrases in first position,such as on the left and on the right in S2 and S3. Fourth, main propositions will beexpressed in superordinate, first position clauses, with modification in second position or embedded relative clauses. And, fifth, all these stylistically relevant choice,of possible formulations for underlying propositions will be monitored by the higherlevel cultural, communicative, and pragmatic controls, providing the overall evaluations and opinions that underlie the selection of specific words, word orderings,and clause structure. Thus, the selection of extreme in S2, the negative quotation inthe same sentence, the neutral deposed in S3, the patient role of the political middle293in El Salvador in S4, and the metaphor hydra in S40, clearly express the overallopinions and ideologies of the writer and the reading public.8.8. TOWARD A PROCESS MODEL OFDISCOURSE PRODUCTIONSo far in this chapter we have concentrated on the strategic aspects of discourseplanning at various levels, from the most global down to the propositional. Ageneral cognitive model of discourse production will have to include more components than just these strategies, of course. It is therefore instructive to placeproduction strategies within the context of a general model, even though we cando no more here than sketch such a model.Recent work is in fair agreement as to what the outlines of a process model ofdiscourse production must be. Both Hayes and Flower 1980 and Collins andGentner 1980 have provided task analyses of the process of discourseproduction in writing that can serve as a guide in that respect. Writing has beenchosen in part for its practical significance in education, and in part for its greaterexplicitness, on which we have repeatedly commented. Hayes and Flowerdistinguish three components in their model of writing a task environment, amemory structure, and the actual process of writing. The first serves essentiallyin a control function and comprises the writers motivation, the characteristics ofthe intended audience, and the topic to be written about. For simplicity, we shallassume these to be constants in a writing episode. The writers longtermmemory, which provides the writer with a source for new ideas to write about,can similarly be regarded as a constant for our purposes, so that we can focus onthe actual process of writing. Hayes and Flower distinguish four subprocesseshere generating ideas, organizing them, translating the ideas into words andsentences, and editing what has been written or thought about. Each of these, ofcourse, is a complex psychological process in its own right, and part of our taskhere, and that of future investigators of writing processes, will be to unpack thesecomplexities. Eventually, we would like to have explicit process models wherewe now have no more than code words such as translating and editing.Idea generation stands for the process of generating ideas from the writerslongterm memory under the constraints of the task environment. The generationprocess need not be direct, however, in that whatever material is dredged upfrom memory may be subjected to expansion and alteration via inferenceprocesses. In what follows we shall elaborate somewhat on the process of ideageneration from memory.Organization is a very important part of writing. Many of the strategies thathave been discussed here deal with organizational processes. Expert writers knowthat organization and planning is crucial and spend as much as twothirds of theirwriting time on organization Atlas, 1979, whereas novices do much less organizing, to the detriment of the writing they produce. Nevertheless, detailed models of294this component of the writing process are rare, in part because the organizationproblem differs so much for different writing tasks. It is not clear exactly wherethe general principles are to be found. For the restricted domain of linearization.though, some progress has been made toward designing explicit process models.We refer to the work of Levelt 1982 who asked subjects to describe graphs ofinterconnected color nodes which formed patterns of varying complexity. On thebasis of the protocols he collected, Levelt was able to distinguish some fairlygeneral principles of linearization. Thus, he could specify strategies people use indescribing these graphs, based on general principles, such as to minimize shortterm memory load. Strategies of, for example, choosing short branches beforelong branches, choosing the least complex branch first, and taking on loops withpriority were found to be global strategies related to shortterm memoryeconomy, whereas other strategies observed were of a more local character.As we have suggested, it might eventually be possible to relate the linearization strategies observed in this simplified experimental situation to actual writingprocesses. In the simplest kind of stories the linearization problem is trivial, becausethe macrostructure itself specifies a canonical causaltemporal sequence.However, in more complex stories as well as in expository prose, problems thatare formally similar to Levelts graph descriptions are encountered. Will thesame, or any, general principles be found to underlie the subjects productionstrategies We have argued repeatedly that comprehension strategies are oftenbased on shortterm memory constraints Kintsch  van Dijk, 1978 Kintsch Vipond, 1979 Chapter 10, and it would seem plausible that the situation issimilar with respect to production.The translation phase of writing involves expressing ideas verbally. Oncemore, we are dealing with a strategic process and it would appear likely thatsentence production strategies are at some level related to sentencecomprehension strategies. Clearly, empirical work in this area is needed.Reviewing and editing is the final process discussed by Hayes and Flower1980. It is a process that can be studied especially well with the tools ofprotocol analysis, as Flower and Hayes have shown. Their data led them todistinguish a locally controlled editing process, which often interrupts otherongoing processes, from a review process that is subject to higher level control.These higher level control processes differ among individuals and for expertsand novices. Thus, some writers follow the processing order generateorganizetranslatereview, whereas others do not. Identifying peoples strategies in thisrespect, and examining them for their effectiveness or ineffectiveness, appears tobe of some pedagogical value.8.8.1. Experiments on Idea GenerationHow idea generation works as a subcomponent of writing or discourse production in general is a problem if great complexity which we as yet do not knowhow to investigate in detail. It might be useful in this situation to investigate a pureidea generation process outside the writing framework. We have, of course, no295guarantee that idea generation in writing, when it is interacting with otherprocesses as sketched here, shares many interesting features with the pureprocess we have studied, but neither do we have information to the contrary, andit would seem worth a try. One does not necessarily, maybe not even usually,write down ideas as they are retrieved from memory. But there are some naturalwriting situations that come fairly close to that, for example, when answering anessay question asking for factual information on some topic, or when reportingan accident in a newspaper. At the other extreme, of course, would be certainliterary forms of writing, where the basic ideas are few and simple, but what isdone with them is elaborate and interesting. Most writing will be somewherebetween these two extremes. We propose to model the case where ideas aresimply retrieved from memory but are not then transformed or changed.Operationally, the situation we have in mind is as follows. Suppose we ask asubject to tell us everything he or she knows about some topic e.g., the role ofnuclear energy in our energy needs, now and in the future, simply saying outloud everything that comes to mind, without editing or organizing. We assumethat what the subject is doing in this task is to retrieve from memory informationin response to these instructions. There may, of course, be times when thesubject does not comply with instructions and engages in editing and organizing,but as Flower and Hayes demonstrated, such instances can be identified in theprotocols and excluded. We want to get at memory retrieval in its simplest,purest form. We assume that this retrieval process is identical in character withthe memory retrieval that has been studied extensively in memory laboratorieseverywhere for the last two decades. Specifically, we propose to use a retrievalmodel designed for laboratory data to describe out task. In the usual episodicmemory task the subject is presented with some items to be remembered usuallywords, but not always and is later asked to recall them. Learning the itemsconsists in associating them with the particular experimental context, and thatcontext is the retrieval cue that is later used to recall them. In our presentsituation, the retrieval cue is not an association with an experimental context, butan association with some topic. Formally, the context is a node to which the toberemembered items, which may themselves be interassociated to some extent,are connected. In our situation, the topic is a node or network of nodes to whichother items have been associated in the past. The question is, however, the samein both instances How do the context nodes, or the topic nodes, manage toretrieve the nodes that are associated with themWe propose to use the model for memory retrieval suggested by Raaijmakersand Shiffrin 1981 and Raaijmakers 1979, to answer that question in partKintsch, 1982b. 1Their model serves as a reasonable first approximation of the1The Raaijmakers and Shiffrin model accounts for many or most of the laboratoryphenomena about memory known today. It is probably as close as one can come to a trueconsensus model of memory. It is, however, not the only model 01 such scope andempirical adequacy Metcalf and Murdock 1981 start with quite different assumptionsabout the memory system but account for more or less the same phenomena. It is quiteconceivable that a knowledge retrieval model could be built around the principles of theMetcalf and Murdock model.296quite complex automatic aspects of the retrieval process. Essentially, it describeswhat happens when a given retrieval cue is used to retrieve information frommemory, what factors contribute to a successful retrieval, how the very act ofretrieval dynamically changes the memory structure itself as well as the retrievalcue. The main part of this operationthe retrieval itselfis unconscious, automatic,and not subject to strategic control. Thus, the strategic aspects of the process canbe isolated and highlighted, allowing us to ask more precise questions thanbefore. Strategies enter into this process in the control of the retrieval cue Howthe retrieval is composed in the first place, how it is changed in response tosuccessful information retrieval or to failure, is a strategic process. Byunconfounding it from other aspects of the memory retrieval process we canstudy it.First, however, we need to examine the empirical situation and the kind ofdata it yields. This was done in a doctoral thesis at the University of Colorado byCaccamise 1981. Caccamise gave subjects32 college studentsan index cardwith one of four topics printed on it and instructions to start talking about thattopic, saying everything that came to mind, without regard to organization,repetitions, or proper syntax, but sticking to the topic that was specified. Of thefour topics, two were of a general nature and two were more specific e.g.,Discuss our energy needs and energy sources, now and in the future versusDiscuss the role of nuclear energy in our energy needs, now and in the future.Of each pair of topic. one was familiar about the educational system and theother was less familiar the energy needs example. In addition, some of thesubjects were told that their prospective audience would be a fifthgrade classthat was about to begin studying energy sources, whereas for other subjects noaudience was specified, thus implicitly assuming an adult audience of peers.Caccarnise scored her protocols in terms of propositions and then derivedvarious measures for them. The most important ones were the total number ofdifferent propositions, the cumulative number of propositions as a function oftime, the number of chunks defined by argument overlap, various organizationalmeasures the details of which need not concern us here, the rate of idea repetition,and the frequency of unassociated ideas. The results of these analyses convincinglydemonstrate the usefulness of the experimental paradigm Caccamise employed.There were large and regular differences between the familiar and unfamiliar topicsthe specificgeneral variation had no effect because subjects found ways to generalize the supposedly specific topics. Familiar topics produced almost twice asmany ideas not including repetitions as unfamiliar ones and a correspondinglylarger number of chunks. The average number of ideas per chunk, however, provedto be approximately constant, with about 2.5 propositions per chunk. On the otherhand, all organizational measures devised by Caccamise indicated a better, morestructured organization for the familiar topics. This was especially clear when oneconsidered the number of unrelated ideas that were produced About five times asmany propositions that were not related by argument overlap to other propositionswere produced for the unfamiliar topics than for the familiar ones. Subjects not onlyretrieved less when the topic was unfamiliar, what they retrieved was also much less297interrelated and organized. It was not that they did not try hard Indeed, thetotal number of ideas produced was about the same in the familiar and unfamiliarconditions, except that many more were repetitions of earlier ones when the topicwas unfamiliar.Of considerable interest are Caccamises results for those cases when theintended audience was specified to be children. As others have also observed inmore conventional writing tasks Atlas, 1979, people are surprisingly poor attaking audience constraints into account. On the surface, everything looksnormal When addressing children, the same number of ideas was produced, thesame number of chunks, and once again, a constant 2.5 propositions per chunk.However, the structure of the ideas produced is much poorer than in the adultcase There is less complexity, less interrelatedness, many more dangling,isolated propositions. The whole process takes about twice as long, but whereaspauses usually occur at meaningful boundaries i.e., where the content changeswhen people are generating ideas for an adult audience, here they tend to bedistributed more randomly. Caccamise concluded that the audience constraintdid not serve as an integral part of the retrieval cue subjects were using in whichcase it would have assured that only material suitable for children was retrieved,but rather was enforced later cm by a special editing process indicated also bymany comments subjects made. This editing process may have destroyed thenormal orderly flow of ideas, resulting in a highly disorganized idea set thatwould require careful reorganization and review before it could be turned into asuitable textbase, especially for the audience in question.8.8.2. A Computer Simulation of Idea GenerationOnce we know that we can get orderly data with our experimentalprocedures, how can we describe them with the Raaijmakers and Shiffrin model,as suggested in the preceding section Kintsch, 1982b The solution we havechosen involves constructing a computer simulation of the model to see whetherthe empirical results obtained by Caccamise can be mimicked at leastqualitatively by the processes assumed here. If so, a more detailed analysis ofproduction strategies can begin Different strategies can be built into the model,their overall results can be observed, and they can be verified by furtherempirical research using protocol analysis. This project was carried out byWalker 1982, in another doctoral dissertation from the University of Colorado.To describe Walkers work we must say at least a few more words about theRaaijmakers and Shiffrin 1981 model. First, why this model and not an alternativeone The answer to that question has at least three parts. It is one of the few modelsaround that is sufficiently formalized. In addition, it works quite well, accountingfor the standard laboratory phenomena of episodic memory experiments withword lists, and quite a few subtle ones as well. Most importantly, it appears to besomewhat of a consensus model, incorporating the major features of memorymodels of the past decade into one sensible whole There is the crucial role of the298retrieval cue as Tulving  Thompson, 1979 among others have emphasizedthere is an associative memory network which has been an importantcharacteristic of recent memory models, as, for instance, in the work ofAnderson and Bower 1972 and there is a place for some kind of redintegrativeprocess which many memory theorists have insisted upon, for example, thepattern completion of Kintsch 197d. All these important principles areintegrated in the Raaijmakers and Shilfrin model.The model assumes an associative network with complex nodes containingsensory, semantic, and associative information. These nodes could be word concepts as well as propositions. The connections among nodes are associationsvarying in strength. Retrieval from this network requires a probe cue to be heldin shortterm memory. The probe consists of an array of cues context cues, taskconstraints. and other relevant cues. In our situations, the other cues are the topicspecified for the retrieval task. However, the probe changes during the retrievalprocess in a strategically controlled way As items are retrieved they may beadded to the probe. displacing other items from the array. One of the mainquestions that concerns us here are the strategies controlling this process.The memory net itself is dynamic, too, and changes in response to theretrieval operations. Specifically, the associative strength between every itemretrieved and the content of the probe is augmented as a consequence of theprocess of retrieving. This generates the kind of output interference observed inmemory experiments as well as in idea generation experiments.The probability that an item is retrieved is a function of the relative strengthof the association of the item with the probe cues as compared to other items.The retrieval operation is always successful, in that it always results in theimplicit retrieval of an item. That item, may, however, not be produced overtly ifits absolute strength is too low. Thus, for a response to occur two things arenecessary An item must be retrieved depending on its relative strength, and theretrieved item must actually be recovered, that is, produced depending on itsabsolute strength. This interplay between retrieval and recovery processes, aswell as the dynamics of the retrieval process, enable the model to account formuch of the data in the memory literature. We cannot dwell here on the reasonsfor the various properties of the model, nor on the actual details of the model.Suffice it to say that we shall be concerned primarily with three parameters of themodel the number of cumulative retrieval failures i.e., a retrieved item cannotbe recovered and reretrievals before purging the probe the number ofcumulative retrieval failures and reretrievals before stopping and the strengthincrement between a cue and a retrieved item. The model has other parameterswhich are not of interest here and can be pretty much treated as constants.Walker deliberately refrained from making ad hoc adjustments in this modelwhen he applied it to the idea generation paradigm. It was of interest how a straightepisodic listlearning model would do in this new situation. Instead of a small list ofitems with their interassociation matrix and a context cue, Walker gave the modelan associative net constructed from 100 nodes. No attempt was made to model anyspecific semantic field, however. Instead, the connections in the 100 x 100 associa299tion matrix were inserted at random, subject to certain constraints. Withassociation strengths varying from 0 to 100, Walker looked, for instance, at netswith high or low average strength values, various distributions of strength values.and, especially, at nets with clusters in which associations within a cluster wererelatively high compared with associations between clusters. Indeed, clusteroverlap was systematically varied.The outcome of these explorations was highly positive. Clearly, the modelwould mimic response patterns like those obtained by Caccamise, and it woulddo so for reasonable parameter choices. Idea generation curves as a function oftime were especially interesting. In their simplest form these have been studiedsince Bousfield 1953 by many investigators, and Walker could show that hismodel yielded the smooth, decelerating cumulative output curves familiar fromthe literature. In addition, he studied individual output curves, which are notsmooth but highly scalloped, and their dependence on model parameters.Similarly, he showed what factors in the model combine to generate high rates ofidea repetition. Most importantly, and quite nontrivially, Walker showed that themodel behaved reasonably when confronted with clusters. The model retrieveditems from clustered nets much like people retrieve information from theirsemantic memory, which is also highly structured. In particular, the clusterstructure of semantic memory constantly overlaps Nodes often pertain to morethan one script or frame, and they enter into various organizational structures.Yet people rarely get confused by this When doctor is encountered as part ofthe surgeon frame very different association, are produced than when it isencountered as part of the dentist or anthropologist frame. Walker showedthat the retrieval model also has the ability to slice up the network in manydifferent overlapping ways, without getting lost.Thus, the model passed the first test. It can mimic qualitatively what weknow happens when people generate ideas. We cannot go into the details ofwalkers work here and must refer the reader to the original source. However, wemust comment on Walkers further work with the model, which goes muchbeyond a mere feasibility study. Once we know that the model givesqualitatively the right results for proper parameter choices, we can startexperimenting with the model. This is a lot easier than experimenting withpeople, and it gives readily interpretable results as we can examine in detail thefactors that produced them. It does not, of course, replace experimenting withpeople, but it can be an all important guide for experiments with people.The experiments Walker did involved trying out various strategies for constructing, maintaining, and updating the retrieval probe. Efficient idea generationrequires a person to operate somewhere between the extremes of being completelyinflexible and simply probing memory with the initial topic as the probe over andover again, and being completely flexible and letting retrieval be guided entirely bythe items already recovered. Even if we find the ideal compromise between theseextremes, questions arise about how the local retrieval data should be combinedwith the topic constraints. How many items are kept in the probe How are theychanged Cue replacement could be entirely on the basis of recency, as in a push300down stack where the lowest item is lost alternatively, replacement could berandom or it could be intelligent in some way or another. Focusing strategiesmight involve replacing that item in the probe array that is least related to therest, whereas divergent thinking strategies might involve the opposite, alwaysreplacing the most interrelated and therefore most redundant item in the probe.Walker showed that the consequences of such strategies could readily beexplored with his model. Some strategies give qualitatively reasonable results,whereas others simply do not work i.e., they result in protocols quite unlikethose of real Subjects. Thus, a pool of strategies can be isolated that areplausible. Empirical observation can now concentrate on this plausible subset ofidea generation strategies The model gives us some idea of what to look forprotocol analyses can then check out the theoretically plausible strategies.Most importantly, Walkers model permits us to distinguish those aspects ofidea generation processes that are a consequence of the inherent retrievaldynamics of the memory system from those that arise as a consequence of higherorder control processes. The model does not include a control component, andhence cannot account for the corresponding behaviors. There were several suchdiscrepancies between model and protocols obtained from real subjects whichillustrate the operation of control processes in production. People often used ahierarchical retrieval strategy Instead of entering the memory structure with thespecified retrieval cue e.g., tell me all the different cars you know and thenexploring this structure randomly, guided only by the dynamics of the automaticretrieval process, the employed a twostage strategy. They first did not searchfor cars at all, but for fields related to cars e.g., parking lots, family cars, foreigncars once a field is retrieved, it is added to the original retrieval cue and thesearch for elements in this field beginsas described by the model. When thefield is exhausted, control is shifted back to search for another field, and theprocess repeats. Each retrieval process for fields where cars are likely to beencountered, and for actual cars within each field are probably as described bythe model, but the model lacks a control component that arranges thesesubprocesses in sequence.Another example of where the model fails because it lacks the right controlprocesses occurs in the retrieval of scriptal information. The time course of retrievalfrom a script e.g., tell me all that happens when one visits a supermarket, ordoctors office is quite different from retrieval from categorical structures Theretrieval rate is constant whereas it is negatively accelerated for categories, andgroup and individual functions are alike whereas scalloped individual functionscontrast with smooth group functions in the case of category member retrieval.Once again, the control of the retrieval cue that is necessary to produce such aprocess goes beyond the basic retrieval dynamics specified by Raaijmakers andShiffrin. These control functions had to be added to the retrieval model before itcould adequately account for idea generation dataa task that according to Walkerappears quite feasible. Thus, we are not saying that idea generation or text production is just automatic memory retrieval that is merely one component of aconsiderably more complex process. It is, nonetheless, an important component,301and in order to study the other components we need to know what aspects ofsuch behavior can be ascribed to it.At the beginning of this chapter we raised the question of why work ondiscourse production has lagged so far behind work on discourse comprehension.We may end the chapter on a positive note. It appears that we now have a theoreticalframework within which the study of discourse production can be very fruitful. Thework that is needed to fill out this framework has barely begun, of course. We needmuch more precise models of various production tasks and a much more extensiveempirical data base than we now have. But at least we are beginning to see whatsuch models would have to be like, what factors they would have to take intoaccount, and we are beginning to gain some understanding of what sorts ofexperiments should be performed and what observations need to be collected.Chapter 9Strategies for the Use of KnowledgeOne of the major contributions of psychology and artificial intelligence to thestudy of discourse processing is the recognition of the fundamental role of thelanguage users world knowledge in production and comprehension. In theprevious chapters we have observed that processing strategies continuously needinformation from longterm memory in order to construct or specify semanticand pragmatic representations of discourse. In other words, much of theinformation needed to understand a text is not provided by the informationexpressed in the text itself, but must be drawn from the language usersknowledge of the person, objects, st4tes of affairs, actions, or events thediscourse is about. We have seen that part of this knowledge is of an episodicnature, that is, is inferred from knowledge in episodic memory as it is graduallyconstrued on the basis of our previous experience. Other knowledge, derivedfrom this episodic knowledge through learning processes of abstraction,generalization, decontextualization, and recombination, has a more general andmore stable nature, and can be used in order to perform a great variety ofcognitive tasks. Although knowledge is of course socioculturally variable, it issufficiently general to allow for intersubjective language use andcommunication.Without this general picture of the world and its underlying regularities, itwould be impossible to understand words, to understand meaningful combinationsof words in sentences, to understand the factdependent relations between sentences, or to understand a discourse as a whole. Understanding a discourse, that is,assigning it a meaningful interpretation, in many respects coincides with understanding the fragment of some possible world the discourse A about. If we cannotmake sense of the facts, and their combination, referred to by the words, sentences,304or episodes of a discourse, we will often say that the discourse itself makes nosense. Since, however, language users know of each other that they share muchof this knowledge about the socioculturally construed world and the socialcontext, they are members of, they may leave much of this presupposedknowledge implicit in their discourses. That is, it is assumed that a reader orhearer can supply necessary missing links or background while understandingthe discourse. Thus, in their comprehension strategies language userscontinuously have to consult this stock of world knowledgefirst, to understandthe text itself, and, second, to construct a picture of the world fragment the text isabout.But if comprehension implies finding a suitable knowledge structure that fitsthe tobecomprehended material, we must not forget that actions and events, a,,well as the discourse about them, are always new in some respects. Hence thepreestablished knowledge schemata will in general not fit the new event or thenew discourse precisely. They can provide a basis or a background forcomprehension. but no more. Everything really new and unexpected must beconstructed on the basis of this background information. Therefore, knowledgeschemata cannot be rigid, but must accommodate many possible variations in theobserved or textually presented objects, persons, and events. Somehow, for thepurpose of comprehension, whether we are comprehending discourse or eventsand scenes, we need a memory organization that is flexible and responsive tocontextual demands.As yet, the nature of that organization is only poorly understood in cognitivescience, nor is there enough known about how such knowledge systems are used.We cannot solve these very deep problems here. Knowledge organization is aproblem beyond the scope of this book. However, we cannot avoid theseproblems altogether. As we have already argued, the use of knowledge is anintegral component of discourse comprehension. We cannot talk about strategiesof discourse comprehension and neglect this central aspect. Therefore, we mustconsider, if only in a preliminary way, the problem of knowledge organization.In the next section. we shall review current thinking about the structure ofknowledge, and raise some questions concerning the use of knowledge. Againstthis background we shall then present our current ideas about the strategies forknowledge use in discourse comprehension. We cannot investigate the processwithout some idea of the nature of the structure. Until more satisfactory, explicitmodels of knowledge structure become available, this whole discussion mustremain tentative. But tentative or not, it is too important to be neglected.9.1. KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMSWe shall first review proposals about the organization of knowledge frompsychology and artificial intelligence. From these, a number of issues of agenera nature can be discerned. They will give us at least some idea what atheory of knowledge representation might look like.3059.1.1. Psychological ApproachesConcepts and CategoriesPhilosophers, and in their wake psychologists, have explored in great detailseveral issues concerning the representation of knowledge. However, this workhas typically had a very narrow focus which restricts its usefulness for presentpurposes.Philosophers have been interested in how general concepts are abstractedfrom concrete instances. The predominant notion has been that general conceptsare defined via some sort of summary description that applies to the class as awhole, stating the necessary and sufficient properties for class membership.Psychologists at first accepted that definition. It was employed in a great deal ofexperimental work on categorization, which very successfully described howpeople classify artificial concepts and how they learn to do so e.g., Bruner,Goodnow,  Austin, 1956 Bourne, 1966. However, as soon as psychologiststurned to natural concepts, all kinds of problems arose with the notion ofnecessary and sufficient characteristics, which eventually led to the abandonmentof the classical view Smith  Medin, 1981. It has recently been resurrected inthe form of predicability hierarchies Keil, 1979, but it is not clear how this newapproach can avoid in the long run the problems that plagued the older theories.For the most part, psychologists today have given up on the classical definitional approach and have developed models of categorization in which optional,nonnecessary characteristics play an important role. Smith and Medin 1981 haveprovided a sensitive review of this research area. The theories in question rangefrom feature models and dimensional models which retain the old idea that conceptsneed to be described via a summary of their properties, but differ from the classicalview in that they take into account nonessential features or dimensions, to modelsin which concepts are entirely or partly characterized via exemplars. As Smithand Medin have shown, quite sophisticated models can be built in this way,which account for a large number of empirical phenomena in their domain.The trouble with these models, for our purposes, is that they are too narrow tobe of much use. Most of them deal with the classification of objects, often invery narrow and specialized domains, such as animal names and kinship terms.Keils ontological concepts are a bit broader including events, for instance,but he does not make very fine distinctions. There is some work on verbcategories most notably Miller  JohnsonLaird, 1976, but on the whole thisresearch falls short of providing us with a model for a knowledge system thatcould support discourse comprehension. The basic problem is that this work hasbeen concerned with only one way in which concepts functiontheircategorization. But there are other things one needs to do with concepts besidesputting them into categories. Specifically, they are needed as a foundation forconstructing text representations. The traditional approach from philosophy andpsychology is of little use to us here.If we turn to linguistics, the situation is not much improved. The linguistslexicon is typically designed within the classical framework to provide definitions for words, their essential properties. The sort of general world knowledge with306its fuzziness that invariably intrudes upon these neat definitions when humanlanguage use is studied is ignored or ruled outside linguistics. Not untiltheadvent of artificial intelligence did knowledge systems and the problems ofknowledge use receive the scholarly attention they deserve.9.1.2. Semantic DecompositionLevels of Cognitive UnitsA central issue with respect to the use of concepts is that of semantic decomposition. In its classical form the notion implies that understanding a conceptmeans accessing the elements from which it is composed, that is, decomposing itsemantically e.g., Katz  Fodor, 1963 the processing implications are clearlyspelled out in Schank, 1972. Thus, the mind was thought to work by puttingtogether and pulling apart a relatively small number of semantic primitives,perhaps corresponding to cognitive primitives Bierwisch, 1969 Miller JohnsonLaird, 1976, somewhat like matter being composed of a small numberof chemical elements. This position is currently untenable for both theoreticaland empirical reasons Fodor, Garrett, Walker,  Parkes, 1980 Kintsch, 1974.Understanding a concept does not necessarily involve decomposing it intoconstituents, be they semantic primitives or not. Chunks are the normal units ofinformation processing both in perception see, e.g., many studies on word andletter or phoneme identification in reading and listening reviewed in Section 2.1and in comprehension e.g., Fodor et al., 1980 some of the studies referred to inwhat follows show that schemata can function as units.But although we must face up to the existence of internally complexpsychological units such as a macroproposition, to cite another example, wemust not lose sight of the fact that the system is indeed a multilayered one. Thereis no such thing as compulsory decomposition into elements, but nevertheless theelements are as real as the chunks, and often processing does indeed involve theelements rather than the chunks as wholes. There is really nothing strange aboutthis state of affairs, and in areas other than semantics, where this issue hascreated a surprising amount of confusion, identical situations have long beenaccepted. Thus, although many semanticists automatically decompose wordmeanings in their analyses, phonologists consider phonemes, syllables, andwords as separate units of analysis, each with its own justification. Although theproperties of a word cannot be reduced to those of its constituent list ofphonemes see the studies on word perception reviewed in Chapter 2, thephoneme nevertheless remains a useful and important unit of analysis. Insemantics, too, we must learn to deal with units of varying size, from atomicelements to complex schemata.Note, however, that this multilayered nature of the system greatly compoundsthe problems for the theorist. Consider the notion of concept. At its own level, it isrelated to a multitude of other concepts, forming semantic fields of various sorts. Italso enters into a variety of propositional relations, thus participating in higher orderchunks. At an even higher level, overlapping and crisscrossing schemata pertain to307the concept. At the same time, the concept itself can be decomposed into a set offeatures, dimensions, or attributes, depending on ones theory, conceivably eveninto an elementary set of semanticcognitive primitives. How are these variouslevels coordinated What determines whether a process reaches up a level or goesdown one What are the relevant constraints in such a system We simply cannotanswer these questions now.9.1.3. The Contribution of Artificial IntelligenceFrames and ScriptsBuilding machines to perform complex cognitive functions very soon demonstrated to people interested in artificial intelligence the crucial role of knowledgein cognition. Suddenly, the structure of knowledge systems became an importantissue in cognitive science. The only thing psychology and philosophy had toofferassociative networks e.g., Anderson  Bower, 1973were found to beinadequate. An extremely influential early attempt to construct a knowledgesystem was the semantic network of Quillian 1968. As in an associativenetwork, the nodes were concepts. The concepts were not defined explicitly byfeatures or essential properties, as in the work we considered earlier, butimplicitly by their position in the semantic network and their relations to otherconcepts. But unlike an associative network where the relations among conceptsvary merely in strength, qualitatively different relations were admitted inQuillians semantic net. Relations among nodes were labeled, rather thanunlabeled as in an associative network Thus, coffee is related to bean, drink, andcup in qualitatively different ways, not just in terms of associative strength.There is no need to describe here Quillians proposal, nor the work that derivedfrom it. Suffice it to say that working with large semantic nets proved to becumbersome, and people soon began to detect structure within such nets. FramesMinsky, 1975 Bobrow  Winograd, 1977 Fahlman, 1979 Charniak, 1977scripts Schank  Abelson, 1977, and schemata Rumelhart  Ortony, 1977 werediscovered. Though there are differences between these concepts e.g., scripts referto stereotyped action sequences, the basic idea is the same. A schema script,frame is a knowledge structure which ties together information in memory. It is alabel with slots that stand in some prearranged relation to each other. Each slotaccepts information of a given type. Information here may mean concepts,propositions, or even other schemata. One can think of the slots of a schema asvariables, which can be replaced with specific instances. This is precisely whathappens when a schema is instantiated in discourse comprehension Specific information fills the appropriate slots of a schema. The instantiated schema will in thisway be one of the knowledge sources that contribute to the strategic construction ofa text representation in episodic memory. However, contrary to other approaches inartificial intelligence, we do not believe that the instantiated frame or script isidentical with a textual representation. We have suggested earlier in this chapter thatmost discourses will on the one hand presuppose general knowledge, but on the308other hand will usually bring new information, including information that is notsimply an instantiation of a frame or script. So, in a story about events in arestaurant we may expect some propositions that are instantiations of frame orscript knowledge e.g., Peter ordered a steak, Mary signaled the waiter, orPeter left a big tip, but we may also expect propositions about interesting,nonscriptal properties of participants, about actions and events that are notstereotypical, or that are organized by other frames or scripts, such as thequarrel or fire scripts. This means that although general knowledge doescontribute to the local and global coherence of the text representation, otherfactors are also involved, such as a local coherence relations based onconditioning, for example, when event or action sequences and their goals areinvolved activating general and episodic knowledge about actions ofparticipants, b global coherence, involving the construction of often uniquemacropropositions, and c textual schemata, such as narrative ones, whichassign some superstructure to the text. It follows that the contribution o1 generalknowledge to the coherence involves general knowledge or metaknowledgeabout likely sequences of events and actions, about motivations and goals, aboutplans and interests, on the one hand, and procedural knowledge about discoursestrategies and discourse structures, on the other. We conclude that the use ofknowledge in discourse comprehension is much more complex than the simpleinstantiation of scripts, script tracks, or script scenes. What we would like toemphasize is that some fragments of instantiated general knowledge are flexiblyused in a strategic manner to understand and represent new, unique informationprovided by the text, which is organized also according to other principles, suchas those of the various textual structures and strategies discussed in the previouschapters, as well as on the basis of episodic experiences.As we will detail in the next chapter, we propose a twostep use of generalknowledge After the activation of certain concepts on the basis of some inputword or clause, some general knowledge fragment e.g., of a frame or script isactivated and instantiated with the specific constants Peter, Mary of the text.This instantiation will in turn activate, and its information be added to, specificepisodic memories about the same or similar situations, namely, the situationmodel. It is the thus activated or constructed information in the situation modelthat forms the knowledge base for understanding the text. For instance, we mayactivate or construct a situation model Fire in a restaurant, involving generalinformation about restaurants, and general information about fires, added topersonal experiences with such or similar fires.In terms of the localglobal distinction that has played such an important partin this book, schemata can be found at either level. There are global schemata, suchas the narrative schema discussed at length in Chapter 7, but also very local ones,such as propositional schemata and verb frames. Our own proposal for a propositional schema was discussed in Chapter 4. Verb frames have been widely used sinceFillmore 1968, both in linguistics and in artificial intelligence. Verb frames organize concepts, in that they assign them to certain case roles, as agents, patients,instruments, and so forth. Thus, we are able to understand John gives Mary a book309as John is the agent of the action give, Mary is its patient, and book the object.But whereas verb frames organize concepts, the frames themselves may beorganized in higher order structures. Charniak 1981 points out that verb framesform an isu hierarchy, not unlike the wellknown isa hierarchy for nouns. Justas a dog is a mammal, and thus may inherit the property of having a headfrom its superordinate, verbs, too, may inherit properties in an isa hierarchy. Ifwe know that reading is a transitive act and that transitive acts have agent andpatient slots, then we do not need to store that information with reading.Instead, we can deduce it from the superordinate node when it is needed. All wehave to be concerned about with reading are the properties that are specific toit, for example, that one reads a text. Charniak shows that this solves one of thelongstanding embarrassments of case theory, namely, the question of how manycases there are. No one has been ever able to show how many cases there are andexactly what they are. In Charniaks analysis this is not a surprise Probablythere are only a few general cases such as agent and patient which apply high upin the verb hierarchy but as one goes down in the hierarchy, more and morespecialized verbs appear, with more and more specialized cases which might aswell remain nameless. Thus, there is no need to worry about the case of inFrench in Charniaks example Frederica read a book in French. The caseanalysis can be useful, even though the slots in the case frames do not come froma closed set. If we leave the field of verb frames and consider schemata ingeneral, there is little reason to suppose that we can come up with a finite, fixedset of slots that schemata can have. In each domain there are probably some slotsthat apply with some generality, just as agent, patient, instrument, etc. in thedomain of verb frames, but as schemata become more specific, special purposeslots must be added. It is difficult to see how formal theories of schemabasedknowledge systems could be possible in view of this ad hoc component. Onewould wish for constraints.Before continuing with a more detailed discussion of some of the problemsencountered in working with schemabased knowledge systems, we need to askourselves to what extent such systems are real, or at least plausiblepsychologically. Recently, a certain amount of experimental work has beenreported which indicates quite clearly that something like a schema is a viablenotion psychologically, and not just a useful construct in artificial intelligence.Most of this work has been concerned specifically with the script concept,and a lot of diverse evidence has been obtained that scripts indeed function aspsychological units. Black and Bower 1979 have shown that scriptbasedepisodes in stories are treated as chunks in memory. This conclusion was furthersupported by Black, Turner, and Bower 1979, who showed that subjects tend tolist the actions of a script together, and that they make recognition errors amongthem. Like chunks, scripts are retrieved as a unit, and the time to retrieve them isindependent of the number of actions in the script, just as it is independent of thenumber of items in a chunk Anderson, 1980 Smith, Adams,  Schorr, 1978.Scripts are not just sets of actions, but ordered sets. If the actions of a script arepresented out of order, subjects tend to reorder them Black, Turner,  Bower,3101979. Furthermore, the usual kind of similarity effect is observed in retrievingscriptrelated actions Retrieval speed depends on how close the actions are toeach other, and how central they are to the script Galambos  Rips, 1982. Howtextual information is integrated with knowledge in reading scriptbased text hasalso been studied by Sanford and Garrod 1981146 and Bellezza and Bower1982. The latter suggests that scripts serve a dual role, both as cognitive cueingstructures and as guides for the allocation of attentional resources duringcomprehension.There is good evidence for the existence of substructures in scripts. Subjectscluster script actions together in a regular way, distinguishing fixed sceneswithin a script Bower, Black,  Turner, 1979 and marking them linguisticallywith a single word ordering, eating in the restaurant script, but not, e.g.,counting the money which is merely part of a paying scene. Abbott andBlack 1980 have argued that the script structure is hierarchical and presentedevidence that script actions in the context of a narrative activate theirsuperordinates in the script hierarchy, but not the other way around. Thus, whenwe encounter the word restaurant in a text, we do not think of ordering,eating, and paying, but if we hear these words which are subunits of a script,the script label restaurant will be activated.In conclusion, it appears that we now have good evidence that scripts withtheir subordinate actions form psychological units chunks in much the sameway as do other concepts that have been studied traditionally within psychology.Indeed. scripts are only too similar to our familiar categories. Like them, theycannot be defined precisely, but are fuzzy by their very nature they cannot beused in simple. fixed ways but are highly flexible and context dependent.Most of the difficulties in designing knowledge systems derive from thisflexibility that concepts, scripts, and schemata share. We have seen the shiftthat took place within psychology in the last decades in the way we think aboutconcepts From the neat, clean definitions via necessary and sufficientproperties we have moved to contextdependent feature sets and exemplars.Scripts and with them schemata and frames have undergone very much thesame evolution, having changed from fixed, prepared structures to contextsensitive entities that are constructed in response to some task demand. Therestaurant script of Schank and Abelson 1977 is the classical representativeof the former view. Situational variety in classical scripts was accounted for byspecial tracts. For instance, in addition to the general restaurant script,Schank and Abelson had special tracks for French restaurant, fast food, etc.But there really is no end to special tracksevery application of the restauranttrack requires its own special track. At this point the script as a fixed knowledgestructure is no longer useful. Instead, we must consider how contextsensitivescripts can be generated on demand out of some flexibly organized knowledgesystem. Schanks MOPS Memory Organization Packets are an attempt todesign such a system Schank, 1979b. It is, however, easier to recognize theneed for a flexible, dynamic knowledge system than to construct such asystem. Many of the problems involved have not yet been solved satisfactorily311nor even recognized, and we can do no more here than to indicate some of theissues and problems involved in constructing flexible knowledge systems.9.1.4. Levels of Cognitive UnitsNeither concepts nor schemata can be defined in the strict sense. The caseagainst definition has been made repeatedly and with a variety of arguments especially Fodor et al., 1980 Kintsch, 1980b Smith  Medin, 1981 . But definitionalsystems, because they are clear and orderly, are so much easier to work with thandynamic, flexible systems the properties of which are not very well understood.Theories about knowledge require constraints and structures to theorize about. Ifthe meaning of a concept cannot be specified once and for all by some small setof semantic elements, if it requires instead a large, open set of complexstatements. theories will be much more difficult to formulate. However, giventhe situational lability of concepts as well as schemata, we have no choice but tolearn to work with complex, messy interactions.The problem is compounded by the fact that we are not dealing with a singleknowledge system, but with a multileveled system. Psychologically relevantknowledge units exist at the levels of features, concepts, propositions, andschemata. Features and concepts are generally considered noncontroversial, andwe can take them as given. The evidence for propositions has been summarizedat several points in this book especially Chapters 2 and 4. Similarly, the realityof schemata has concerned us repeatedly throughout this book, most specificallyin the previous section. Interactions among these levels, however, produce awhole new set of problems.There are other questions, too, equally formidable ones. Are knowledgerepresentations abstract, propositional, or do they involve imagery How can weever identify the internal structure of a knowledge system from behavioral dataalone Clearly, all we can strive for is a model, a theory, and as with alltheories, we cannot know whether it is the only one or even the best one. In fact,we know that it is not the only possible onethere are always more theories,especially vague ones. The problem for us is not to attain the impossibletheultimate, right theory rather, it is a much more modest one to achieve a goodtheory of knowledge representation, one that is useful in explaining theimportant facts that need explaining, and one that does it in a sensible, naturalway Anderson, 1976 Pylyshyn, 1973 Kieras, 1980b. That is hard enoughwithout becoming involved in controversies about undecidable issues.In spite of the many questions that we have to leave open at this time, it ispossible at least to sketch the overall outlines of a knowledge system. First of all,the system must have many levels, with nodes from one level forming often overlapping chunks at higher levels. In such a system it is possible that the elements oftwo chunks are not directly associated but only associated indirectly via their chunknodes. The notion of chunk has long been familiar in psychology Miller, 1956312Simon, 1974 indirect associations via control elements also have been used forsome time Muller, 1911 Estes, 1972. Because chunks at some point have to hacreated from elements that reside in shortterm memory simultaneously, chunksize is limited to about four elements following Broadbent, 1975. Hierarchicalchunking structures are used to overcome this limitation Mandler, 1967.Before we consider how such structures are used in comprehension we needto make one more point about the term knowledge system. Usually, when wetalk about knowledge we mean decontextualized, generalized information asopposed to contextembedded, unique personal experience. That is, we meansemantic memory as opposed to episodic memory in the terminology of Tulving1972. Although that distinction is useful for many purposes, it is quitemisleading here because any kind of information in longterm memory can beused in comprehension, whether it is generalized knowledge or a special episode.Furthermore, the structure of episodic memory must exhibit the same multilevelcharacter as the structure of general knowledge. For present purposes, therefore,we do not want to make a distinction between the two Knowledge, as the term isused here, is simply everything m know, whether it is generalized informationdistilled from many experiences, or the memorial records of a single, uniqueexperience.9.2. KNOWLEDGE USE INMETAPHOR COMPREHENSIONA particularly interesting use of knowledge occurs when phrases have to beunderstood nonliterally. Specifically, consider the construction of propositions.We assume that every time a proposition is completed, a knowledge check ismade m determine how it is to be interpreted. This interpretation determineswhat inferences, if any, follow from a given proposition. A problem arisesbecause a great many expressions that we encounter are not used literally. Howdo we understand metaphors and other nonliteral expressions which must failthis knowledge check We certainly do understand such expressions, and not asesoteric rarities which require a lot of overt problemsolving activity, butnaturally and readily.The classical processing theory has been that metaphors are first rejected assemantically anomalous, and then reinterpreted on the basis of some special strategies to yield appropriate interpretations. There have even been some attempts tobuild explicit process models of this kind, specifying how the initial anomalyjudgment and the later reinterpretation occur e.g., Kintsch, 1972, and Miller,1979, for metaphors, Clark  Lucy, 1975, for indirect requests. Any such twostage notion of metaphor interpretation implies that nonliteral expressions requiremore extensive processing than literal expressions The latter simply pass theknowledge check and that is that, whereas some kind ofextra processing has tooccur for anomalous expressions. There is, however, no evidence that this is thecase. Metaphors Ortony, Schallert, Reynolds,  Antos, 1978, idioms Swinney 313Cutler, 1979, and indirect requests Clark, 1979 are understood as easily and asdirectly Glucksberg, Gildea,  Bookin, 1982 Gibbs, 1982 as comparableliteral expressions. These conclusions hold for conventionalized orsemiconventionalized metaphorsmore extensive problemsolving activities arepresumably required for new creative metaphors, such as those used in someforms of modern poetryvan Dijk, 1972 van Dijk  Petofi, 1975 Ching, Haley, Lunsford, 1980 Groeben. 1982.Let us review what we know today about metaphor understanding First ofall. people can tell what is a literal expression, what is a good metaphor, andwhat is plain nonsense or could be interpreted in a meaningful way only withmuch specialpurpose processingthe fact that metaphor boundaries are onceagain fuzzy can come as no surprise any more second, people have no moretrouble understanding good conventionalized metaphors than they do literalexpressions. This suggests that they probably use the same or similarcomprehension strategies with metaphors as with nonmetaphors, and that prettymuch the same amount of calculation is involved in processing one or the other.What may be wrong about the classical conception may not be so much howmetaphors are understood, but rather how literal expressions are understood. Theknowledge check that occurs with literal expressions is not in itself sufficient,but must be followed up with further processingvery much as is the case withmetaphors, the difference being that the check is positive in one case andnegative in the other. Although the further processing of literal and nonliteralexpressions is not identical, it is similar in many ways. Let us start withmetaphors. We assume, first, that an expression like prices are soaring is checkedagainst the knowledge base and that anomaly is detected hence, we know thatwe are dealing with a metaphor. Next, we have to determine what theimplications of the proposition prices are soaring are, which is done through theapplication of certain comprehension strategies. Although our picture of preciselywhat such strategies involve is still incomplete, some important cases have beendescribed by Carbonell 1981. Carbonell has studied some of the more frequenttypes of metaphors described by Lakoff and Johnson 1980, among them themoreisup, lessisdown metaphors of which we just have cited an example. Heconsiders why such metaphors are used e.g., to transfer knowledge from a relativelywellunderstood domain to a poorly understood one and what strategies we usein understanding them. His main point is that these strategies can be ordered andform an expected invariance hierarchy. Metaphors are mostly used to saysomething about goals and plans, often about causal structures and functionalattributes, sometimes about temporal orderings, attributes, and tendencies, rarelyabout social roles or structural properties, almost never about descriptiveproperties and object identity. In interpreting the metaphor we check forimplications in the order just given, from goals downward if information isfound in a category, we take that to be the implication of the metaphor and stop.Thus, in John is a fox we stop as soon as we find the tendency ascribed to foxesof being sly we do not go down to the physical attribute and conclude that314John has pointed ears. In contrast, not knowing anything about giraffes otherthan their size and perhaps clumsiness, we have to go all the way to the level ofphysical descriptions when we interpret John is a giraffe.Thus, Carbonell has at least a partial theory of metaphor understanding andthe strategies involved. We cannot do justice to his work here, and many seriousquestions remain. For instance, Carbonells invariance hierarchy must somehowrespond to context effects because how a metaphor is interpreted can be stronglyinfluenced by context. Furthermore, there may be various other metaphor comprehension strategies, relying on quite different operations such as asymmetricalsimilarity judgments, as suggested by Ortony, 1979. There is certainly more tobe known. But, at the minimum, Carbonall has specified at least somecomprehension strategies that account for how some metaphors are understood.We would like to suggest that very similar comprehension strategies must beused in the understanding of literal expressions. A literal expression is not understood simply by noting that it is semantically acceptable. People apparently dothat, just as they note that metaphors are semantically unacceptable, but thatalone is not enough. Metaphors pick out one or more implications ofsemantically anomalous propositions to form the basis of an interpretation. Withsemantically regular propositions, context does the same thing. In either case,comprehension strategies are needed to determine exactly how the proposition isto be interpreted. The concepts that we use in our language are just not preciseenough by themselves. Usually, a speaker can trust the context to give themprecision so that they convey the intended meaning, whereas at other times ametaphor might be used to point the hearer in the right direction. This propertyof language has been appreciated for some time, for instance, by Weinreich1966 who introduced the concept of transfer features A sentence contexttransfers features to a concept used in that sentence to give it its full meaning.Consider, for instance, the verb turn, as in the wheel is turning, the weather isturning, the car turned a corner, Joe turned on his accuser, he turned around, heturned pale, he turned eighty, he turned the doorknob, he turned into a father, heturned u hose on the fire. What turn means in these phrases is determined by thecontext provided by each phrase. It is not enough for a knowledge check todetermine that wheel is an appropriate argument for turn, and hence that theproposition is semantically acceptable, but it has to provide the necessaryspecificationa process not totally unlike what happens in metaphor understandingvan Dijk, 1972.Consider another example, provided by Bierwisch 1982, involving themoaning of money in the following sentences John lost his money as he was notaware of the hole in his pocket and John lost his money by speculating on thestockmarket. What money means in the two sentences is quite different, anddetermined by the context. Again, merely concluding that money is asemantically appropriate argument for lose does not get us very far, though it ispart of the story.Somewhat paradoxically, when we ask what strategies are involved in specifying concepts when they are used literally, we know even less than when we askabout their use in metaphorical contexts. A considerable amount of work needs to315be done before we achieve a detailed understanding of these processes but seeChing et al., 1980, and van Dijk  Petofi, 1975, for some relevant attempts.9.3. REDINTEGRATION, REMINDING, ANDPARTIAL MATCHESThe main problem concerning knowledge use is that the knowledge base thatwe use in comprehension is huge. It must be huge in order to avoid errors. Smallknowledge systems make errors. Only a huge, interactive, redundant system permits us to react to the world adaptively. The problem, then, is how we canretrieve the right piece of information from such a system.This is a complex problem which must be addressed in parts. First, let usconsider the actual mechanism of memory retrieval. We have argued in Chapter8 that the laboratory research on memory has provided a reasonable model forthis mechanism. We refer here to the memory retrieval model of Raaijmakersand Shiffrin 1981 and its adaptation to knowledge retrieval by Walker 1982.However, what we have is merely a model for that part of the retrieval processthat can accurately be called a mechanism, but not for the strategic processesthat control this mechanism. The question of whether the Raaijmakers andShiffrin model is really the right one, or even the best one available, is notcrucial for us here. It surely is a good first approximation, and it undoubtedly isnot the last word. The main problem for us is that this model is but a singlecomponent of a knowledge retrieval system. First of all, it does not dealexplicitly with the multilayered nature of the system, though Walker 1982 hasmade some beginnings in dealing with chunks within the framework of thatmodel. Second, it only tells us what happens when a given retrieval cue is usedto tap into memory. What remains largely unexplored are the strategies used toestablish this cue in the first place, and to change it in response to the outcome ofthe retrieval process, and the use to which the retrieved information is then put.In the idea generation paradigm studied by Walker, these strategies wererelatively simple. When we are concerned with knowledge use incomprehension, much more complex strategies need to be considered.Knowledge is needed in comprehension to fit into it the new information, inorder to provide a structure for organizing it, that is, for making sense of the newinformation. But the existing knowledge structure never quite fits the newinformation. Some important pieces are always missing in the puzzle, and othersdo not fit at all. In the terminology of computer science, we always have toperform a partial match.The problem has been recognized for a long time in psychology. Classicalstatements are Hamiltons law of redintegration and Hoffdings law of totalityHamilton, 1859 Hoffding, 1891. In this century, Selz 1939 had some highlyoriginal thoughts about this problem. See the monograph and text edited by deGroot and Frijda 1981 on Selz and his work. His notion of pattern completion,316however, remained without much impact on psychology. More recently,cognitive scientists have become interested in these problems again, mostlyunder the influence of artificial intelligence, such as Schanks concept ofreminding and the work on patterndirected inferences in computers Schank,1979 Waterman  HayesRoth, 1978.How can partial matches be successful in a knowledge system that is as hugeand as complexly organized as the human one Brute force is probably part ofthe answer. Matching is one of the elementary cognitive operations, and isapparently performed efficiently and effectively by the brain. However, bruteforce can hardly be the whole answer. Strategies are needed to reduce theenormous amount of computation that must be performed in comprehension.Techniques employed in artificial intelligence for similar purposes can give ussome idea of what they might be.Intuitively, we make a distinction between active and quiescent knowledge. Atany point in the comprehension process, a certain area of knowledge appears to bereadily available and actively participating in the process, while other fields ofknowledge remain quiescent, which frequently leads us to overlook important andinteresting relations between the new information and old problems and questionsthat somehow were never brought into contact with it. In most current artificialintelligence programs this would happen because the new information is notmatched with all of the existing knowledge system, but only with an active subsetthereof. The active subset can be selected in various ways. Spreading activation in asemantic network has often been invoked for that purpose Quillan, 1968 Collins Loftus, 1975 Anderson, 1976. There is good evidence that the spread of activationis a plausible model psychologically. At the very least, it seems that activatedinformation is matched first, before the more remote possibilities are tried, or isotherwise given some advantage if the matching occurs in parallel. But theremay be other processes, in addition to or instead of spreading activation, thatlimit the amount of knowledge that is being considered at any time. A usefulstrategy appears to be based on a bias for global over local matches If possible, finda match at the level of schemata, which will take precedence over lower ordermatches and guide them to the exclusion of matches that do not conform to theschema. Such a global bias appears to be an efficient device for avoidingunnecessary analyses, and in the last section of this chapter we shall presentsome experimental data that show that people actually use such a strategy indiscourse comprehension. Other strategies to achieve the same purpose rely onthe principle of first making a rough, approximate match, and then following uponly those elements that passed this initial criterion. We have excellent evidencethat people use such a strategy in making recognition judgments in laboratoryexperiments Atkinson  Juola, 1974 and probably also in a host of othersimilar decision situations see the discussion on twostage decision models inKintsch, 1977a. The same strategy appears to be useful in knowledge utilization.In the ACT production system, for instance, a certain number of likelycandidates are first selected and put on the agenda the APPLYLIST for the actualmatching Anderson, 1976. This is done crudely but effectively by the criterion of317argument overlap If at any time working memory contains the concepts A, B, S,and V, then all productions with A, B, S, and V on the condition side are put onthe APPLYLIST for futher consideration. Which production of those selectedthen applies first depends on a number of other factors, such as its strength anindex of how recently and successfully it has been applied and its specificity.Joshi 1978 uses argument overlap recursively to select relevant rules and factsin his inference system. 1Given certain rules, a set of relevant facts is determinedas discussed here. then the set of rules is augmented by adding those that sharearguments with the new expanded fact set, and so on, until a local closure isobtained.9.4. STRATEGIES FOR KNOWLEDGEUSE IN DISCOURSEThe general strategies for knowledge utilization find their counterparts in discourse strategies. Given the kind of knowledge structure we have beendiscussing here, it would seem that a global bias could be used effectively torestrict the matching process. As soon as a match, or rather a partial match, isestablished at the schema level, all lower order matches could be constrained tobe congruent with it. At least, this would be a good first hypothesis which couldsave a lot of processing time and resources. If that first hypothesis iscounterindicated, other, unexpected possibilities have to be tried, of course. Thisstrategy will be further explored in Section 9.6.In selecting an appropriate schema or rather in constructing one, as we shallemphasize in what follows, devices like the APPLYLIST or Joshis 1978Local Context Closure could play a role to limit the number of alternatives thatmust be considered. Basically, the idea is to use a twostage decision strategyFirst reject all candidates that do not appear to be applicable on some roughcriterion, then worry about the rest. Knowledge utilization strategies interact hereclosely with the macrostrategies. Whatever concepts and propositions have beenidentified to be of global significance for the text on the basis of the strategiesdiscussed in Chapter 6 also must hold the clues as to the appropriate knowledgestructure which is to be applied globally for the interpretation of the text. Thus, ifwe have identified as the macroproposition of a text fragment John is taking thetrain to Paris, we thereby have also identified a knowledge source for theorganization of the text.In our example, the required knowledge structure would be a script taking atrain. At least it would be for some of us, who on the basis of past experience havedeveloped such a script. For many American readers, however, the problem would1Rules and facts parallel the distinction between procedural and declarativeknowledge which is often made e.g., Anderson, 1976. It is useful to keep declarative andprocedural knowledge apart. The former provides a basis for computations withoutactually changing the system Changes can have wide and sometimes unthoughtofrepercussions in a complex interacting network, and need to be made with care. A specialprocedural component operating on the declarative knowledge base can be made responsible for taking actions, thus providing a much needed buffer between thought and action.318be more complex, since they do not always have recourse to a train script, ifthey never hav taken a train and perhaps never have read much about takingtrains either. Assume, however, that our hypothetical reader has taken a trainonceto Baltimore. We would not want to suppose that a generalized,decontextualized train script resulted from that single experience, but ourreader probably remembers quite well the highpoints of the trip. From thatspecific memory episode a schema can now be constructed The events that arestill part of that memory episode become slots for textual information of asimilar type. Our reader organizes and hence understands Johns trip on the trainto Paris by putting it into correspondence with the readers own, vaguelyremembered, train trip to Baltimore. Propositions in the text that partially matchpropositions in memory are put into the framework or schema provided by thereaders memory. The fact that the readers memory about that train trip toBaltimore may contain many things that could not possibly happen to John onhis way to Paris never intrudes. The reader does not expect the same things tohappen to John on his train ride rather, he or she merely notes whatevercorrespondences there are. Needless to say, this process is not necessarily oreven usually conscious.Even if our reader never had taken a train, he or she could still construct quiteeasily a schema to understand the text about Johns trip. The reader will have ageneral schema andor personal experiences about other types of publictransportation, say about riding a bus. General problemsolving procedures cannow be applied to construct a schema for Johns train trip in analogy to whateveris known about riding the bus.The point of these examples is that the schema used for discoursecomprehension is always constructed. The raw material may be general,decontextualized knowledge, or some personal experience or a mixture of thetwo, or merely some remotely similar knowledge structure or experience that istransferred to the present situation via analogy. When we talk about a generalschema or script for taking trains, all we mean is that we know a lot about trains,that this knowledge is general and context independent, and that some parts of itare used in constructing a coherent text representation. Which parts, specifically,is quite unpredictable and changes from text to text or experience toexperience. The text selects the schema slots it needs. The unused portion of theknowledge does not necessarily become a part of the text representation. It may,if it is needed to fill a gap in the text conditions under which this is known tooccur have been discussed in Section 2.7 or if the reader for whatever reasonchooses to elaborate the text. It is possible to read a great deal into a text, andcases are legion when readers have done exactly that. Certain text typesespecially poetry even encourage the reader to do so. But, in general, readersstick pretty much to the text and the inferences that are necessary for itscoherence. Specifically, we claim that it is not the case that all slots in a schemathat could be created on the basis of ones knowledge are indeed created andassigned default values when a schema is activated and used in understanding atext. The experimental results discussed in Section 2.7 form the basis for thisclaim.319To return to our train example, if our reader with a given knowledge baseabout trains, say a very rich one, reads two texts, one about Johns firstclass tripon the train to Paris, and one about Marthas journey on the TranssiberianRailroad, obviously he or she will not only construct two differentmacrostructures for these two texts, but will actually use two somewhat differentschemata in doing so The texts will require different pieces of knowledge, indifferent combinations, so that two different schemata will be generatedaccording to these diverging text demands from the same knowledge base. Notethe contrast between this notion of contextdependent knowledge utilization andthe application of preexisting, fixed scripts with firstclass and Transsiberiatracks.The three cases of knowledge use we have discussed so farusing generalknowledge to construct a schema, adapting a personal experience, and schemageneration through analogical reasoningall have in common that they are notspecific to any particular type of text, but represent general strategies that areemployed as needed in many different types of situations. Specialized knowledgeutilization strategies are, however, often of great importance in understandingcertain types of texts, mostly of a technical nature. An example that has beenstudied in some detail concerns understanding word arithmetic problemsKintsch  Greeno, 1982 see also Section 10.5.9.5. KNOWLEDGE USE IN THE NEWSWEEK TEXTIn this section we shall provide some examples of the kinds of knowledgestructures that are necessary for understanding the Newsweek text and of thestrategies involved in activating and using them. In a sense, what we are doinghere is no more than reviewing what has been done with this text in the earlierchapters What kinds of knowledge structures were used in interpreting the textHow do they interact across levels How are they kept active in memory9.5.1. The Lexicon and the Construction of PropositionsThe lexical information needed to build propositions has been partially indicated in Columns A and D of Table 4. l The former contains a sketch of thesyntactic information that is required, and the latter identifies relevant bits ofknowledge about the word concepts that are being processed. Neither has beenformalized in any way, because we are still lacking a systematic theory ofknowledge structures.Nevertheless, it is of some interest to look at these entries a little moreclosely, so that we can at least see what sort of things an eventual formal theoryof knowledge will have to deal with. Take the first word pair of the textcompared with. We have identified it as a verb and supplied an implicit agentwe, or Newsweek. Furthermore, we can strategically identify it as belongingto a subordinate clause, hence generating a syntactic expectation, as shown inTable 4.1. The semantic frame of COMPARE must look something like this3201 COMPARE AGENT, OBJECT1, OBJECT2, PROPERTYwhere the prime after OBJECT 1 and 2 indicates that more than a single objectmay be involved. PROPERTY either is a property of the objects beingcompared  Compared with apples, peaches are sweeter, or is ascribed to theobjects, thus requiring a metaphorical interpretation as the colors gray andblackandwhite are ascribed to countries in the first sentence of our text.Furthermore, we need to associate a meaning postulate with 1 to the effectthat the OUTCOME of COMPARE is either a similarity or dissimilarity. Thissuperficial analysis gives us all we need to know about compare to understandthe first sentence. Note that the knowledge here is quite context independent.Consider next the word gray from the same sentence. When it appears inthe text we can assign it a particular syntactic function and we can identify it asa color term as such, it would be defined linguistically with respect to othercolor terms as well as cognitively by a certain perceptual act and sensoryexperience, but we do not know which of its semantic aspects to activate e.g.,whether the sensory experience, or some association we might have with it.That can only be done when we come to the next word group in the text in ElSalvador. At this point the reader realizes that the literal meaning of gray is notcalled forcountries do not have colors. Thus, some other aspect of grayneeds to be found that fits the situation. The title of the article and its contextcontrol this process, suppressing inappropriate readings e.g., the gray asreferring to rainy weather, which would be appropriate in another context, forexample in a sentence like Scotland was gray, and constraining gray to referto the political situation in a country, thereby priming the reading of gray asindistinct or the like. Note that gray is not precisely the same in this contextas indistinct or any other conceptif such a perfect paraphrase existed theauthor of the article might have preferred it to the use of the metaphorical gray.Compared with our first example, the strategic use of knowledge in interpreting gray is certainly very complex. It is both context dependent and subject totopdown effects. As we have emphasized throughout this chapter, the strategiesfor knowledge use have to be fine tuned and sophisticated, and will not be veryeasy to formulate explicitly.One of the points that we have emphasized is that knowledge usestrategies must furnish only the relevant knowledge and not overburden thesystem by retrieving irrelevant information. This can be illustrated byconsidering the processing of the word Guatemala in the first sentence of ourtext. Although most readers probably do not know very much about thiscountry, the typical reader might know a great deal more than what is neededhere. The knowledge about Guatemala that is actually activated here is quitespecific and deals only with the political struggles in that country The participantsrightleft, their goals destruction of the other side, causes lack of consensus,oppression, actions preparatory actions such as buying arms, main actionssuch as fighting and murdering. Only the participant information, ofcourse, would be activated in the first sentence, the rest would be added as321the respective sections of the text are being read. Thus, we have a successivegrowth of the active knowledge base about Guatemala as the article is beingprocessed. As a final example, consider the expression led by in the secondsentence Number 7 in Table 4.2, the guerrillas are led by a faceless bunch ofpeople. It is interesting because it illustrates nicely the interplay between topdown and local processes in assigning lexical meaning to words. The verb tolead is almost as multifaceted as to turn which we discussed earlier. We knowfrom the word identification literature see Section 2.1 that initially a very broadcontextindependent meaning of lead is activated as the word is read, but thentopdown processes take over to guide the further interpretation of the word. Atthat point in the process, a politics frame is active at the macrolevel whichtogether with the previous word groups constrains the meaning of lead Politicalgroups have leaders, and it is in that sense that lead is interpreted. Note that froma processing standpoint, what happened here is not very different from whathappened with the word gray An initial superficial identification of the word isfollowed by a contextdependent selection of its relevant aspectsregardless ofwhether these are metaphorical as with gray or literal as with lead. The amountof processing involved is comparable.9.5.2. Macrostructure FormationScripts and frames need to be put together from the readers knowledge baseto support the process of macrostructure formation. As we see in Table 6.2, thefirst frame used by the macroprocesses is the politics frame. Although the wordpolitical was not part of the title of our article, the contextual, communicative,and schematic strategies of the reader will probably have inferred that thechoices mentioned in the title are political choices, and hence that the article isabout politics in Guatemala. This provisional topic choice together with thecontent of the first sentence produces the first macroproposition, as described inSection 6.5 There are no political choices in Guatemala, activating a politicsframe as the relevant organizational schema for the propositions of the text.Activating this frame means that from the readers wide knowledge of politics,certain pieces of information are selected because they match pieces of the text,and are then used as a framework for establishing a coherent textbase.Specifically, what we need to know first is that there are political groups on theleft, right, etc., with certain general characteristics that there are certain politicalpersons first the unnamed diplomat, later congressmen, presidents, etc. andthat there are certain political actions like leading groups and dominating acountry. As we have seen, this frame knowledge is needed not only for theestablishment of coherence relations and of a macrostructure, but also for thepurely local processes of concept identification. It determines what aspects of theknowledge that we have associated with a concept will be used in interpretingthe text.Once a frame is activated it may be further specified by the text. For instance,Macropropositions 3, 4, and 5 specify the politics frame by indicating thestatus of certain political groups.322The other two largescale knowledge systems that are required forunderstanding the Newsweek text are about U.S. foreign policy and about civilwar. Their role is very much like that of the politics frame. They serve toconstrain local interpretations, as we have shown. They guarantee coherencee.g., by assigning to Macroproposition 13Guatemala acquires arms fromother countriesthe role of preparatory act in the war script. Finally, theseframes are basic to macrostructure formation The macropropositions are,indeed, instantiations of slots in the frame. Thus, to cite just a few examples fromthe civil war frame, M5, Political center has been murdered instantiates oneof the action slots in that frame terror against political opponents M7Theregime had counted on Reagans helpand M9Guerrillas backed bycommunist countriesinstantiate another action slot in the same frame helpfriends M13, already mentioned, instantiates a preparatory act in the warframe, and so on.Note, however, that we do not simply retrieve the war frame fromknowledge and then fill its slots with textual information, but that we constructthe frame on the spot from knowledge components under the control of the textitself. Thus, a certain slot is created because an appropriate macroproposition hasbeen formed. Frame construction and macrostructure formation are intertwined,and merely form different aspects of the same process.Another type of knowledge that is important in macrostructure formation isof a schematic nature. In this case, the news report schema is relevant. We havediscussed this in some detail in Chapter 7 and need not repeat this discussionhere. Suffice it to say that the activation conditions for this schema lie in thenature of the text being read and the superheadline Special Report.However, not only knowledge of various types plays a role in discourseunderstanding, but also opinions, attitudes, and emotional responses. Indeed,their role is especially notable in the Newsweek text analyzed here. We haverepeatedly stressed this role in previous sections, pointing out, for instance, thatthe very title of the pieceGuatemala No Choicespresuppose a U.S.perspective and U.S. values. Thus, attitudes are anything but negligible inunderstanding this discourse. However, since theoretical work in that area is atpresent even less well developed than with respect to knowledge use, and since itis outside the scope of this book, we cannot do here much beyond pointing out,informally, the enormous significance and the nontrivial nature of theseproblems van Dijk, 1982b.9.5.3. The Control SystemAt several points in this book we have claimed that knowledge structures thatare activated at various levels during discourse comprehension fulfill a controlfunction. Indeed, we often have used the term control system to refer to this activeknowledge segment. Although a full discussion of this notion must be deferreduntil Chapter 10, we want to illustrate this notion by means of the Newsweek text.Suppose we have arrived at the words led by in the second sentence of our textthe323Example we used in the preceding section. What comprises the control system atthis point in processingFirst of all, there is the global context which guides the higher level strategicchoices of the reader the whole sociocultural context, as well as the specificcontext of reading Newsweek. Next, there are more specific knowledge structuresthat we have assumed to be activated at this point first of all, the news reportschema, then the politics frame as discussed above. Next, we need to deal withthe text itself The first macroproposition is available at this time and controls theongoing text processing. Also activated is whatever knowledge is needed at thatmoment for the local text processing, namely, the understanding of the currentphrase led by. Thus, the control system at that moment in time consists of2 a.

It is recency tagged and therefore can be readily retrieved viathese recency tags, independent of contentbased retrieval cues which would berequired for the retrieval of other, nonactivated sections of the readers longtermmemory. Thus, this active section of memory forms a surround for the actualcomprehension processes, controlling and guiding them. As outlined in moredetail in the next chapter, we assume that actual processing occurs in a workingregister which has ready access to the control system as discussed here and to alimited capacity shortterm store which contains the most recent text fragmentsthat are being processed. Specifically, in our example we would have in theshortterm store the immediate preceding propositions S1 as outlined in Table4.1 and the text fragment currently being processed On the left is a collectionof extreme MarxistLeninist groups. . . .. Once a decision is made that the newtext fragment cannot be incorporated into S1, S1 is dropped from the shorttermbuffer and a new proposition, in this case S2, is formed. Of course, S1 remainsreadily accessible on the basis of recency cues, just as other information in thecontrol system. In effect, S1 becomes part of that control system. However,whereas some information in the control system is relatively permanent 2a,2d, mere recency will soon become insufficient to retrieve S1 as otherinterfering text propositions are constructed in the course of reading, andsubsequent retrieval must be achieved on the basis of contentbased retrievalcues.We have, perhaps inappropriately, anticipated quite a bit of Chapter 10 here.The sketch of the memory processes involved in discourse understanding will beelaborated and explained there. However, since we shall not return to the Newsweekexample in Chapter 10 on the grounds that such a discussion would be too speculative, given the extreme complexity of this text although important to illustrate our324points in previous chapters it would become overwhelming at the present level ofanalysis, we felt it important to indicate here, at least in a rough way, how thecontrol system would function in reading the Newsweek text.9.6. EXPERIMENT 6 GLOBAL BIASESIN KNOWLEDGE UTILIZATION 2One of the strategies we have suggested for making knowledge utilizationmore efficient was to control the application of local strategies through globalconstraints. In comprehending a text, the reader or listener must respond to constraints at various levels, from global ones down to contraints at the lexical level.Global constraints could be used to restrict the range of local alternatives thatwill be considered.Specifically, suppose that some sentence S out of context partially matchessome number n of knowledge structures K1, K2, . . . Ki, . . . Kn, and that Kiprovides the best partial match and is hence chosen most often to interpret thesentence when it is presented out of context. Suppose, furthermore, that somecontext C partially matches the knowledge structures Kj . . . Kn but does notmatch K1 . . . Ki, where Ki is the previously preferred knowledge structure. Wehypothesize that in comprehending S, the context C prevents activation of K1 . . .Ki, so that when S is interpreted in the context of C, the interrelation will now bebased on Kj . . . Kn, that is, on those knowledge structures that are appropriatefor C as well as S specifically, the previously favored Ki will now be neglected.We present here a partial test of this hypothesis. A full test would require ademonstration of the activation or inactivation of various knowledge structuresduring comprehension. This has not yet been done, but we have tested animplication of the hypothesis If knowledge is active during comprehension, itshould influence the nature of the continuation responses readers make whenthey are given an incomplete text and are asked to provide an appropriatecontinuation. If a reader expects the text to continue in some particular way, weconclude that the organization that the reader has formed at that point in thecomprehension process is the source of his or her expectations. Continuationsreveal the constraints under which the comprehension processes operate.Consider the critical sentence S if subjects read S out of context and areasked what they expect might come after S in some unspecified text, they willgenerate some common answers. What these answers are is determined by thepropositions used in S and by the lexical items in S, that is, by sentencelevelconstraints.Suppose S is embedded into a text that can be organized around some conventional frame, and that S itself fits into that frame. We hypothesize that if readers areasked for their expectations after reading S in a framecontext, they will respond2This research was supported by Grant MN 15872 from the National Institute ofMental Health. We thank Craig Yarbrough for his help.325with statements derived from the constraints of the overall thematic organizationof the text, rather than from the sentence alone. On the other hand, if S isembedded in a text that is not suitable for organization in terms of somesuperordinate frame, then the readers expectations will be determined by thesentencelevel constraints alone, just as in the case where the sentence ispresented alone.Readers will always form expectations easily, because they always operateunder some constraints in the comprehension process. The critical prediction isthat these constraints will be global ones if subjects are able to form global,framebased organizations, but local if a text is too ill structured for framebasedorganizational processes.Consider the following sentence Last year, Eva Benassi became seriouslyill with peritonitis. A group of subjects will state how this sentence could becontinued after reading it out of context. A second group of people will read ashort paragraph that is lacking in structure and that does not have a clearcuttopic, and they, too, will continue the target sentence. We hypothesize that thesetwo groups of subjects will respond with similar expectations about how the textwould continue In both cases, these expectations should reflect the sentencelevel constraints effective at this point in the comprehension process, with someintrusions from the paragraph content when the sentence is read in the context ofan unorganized paragraph. On the other hand, if the same target sentence isembedded in a paragraph discussing miracles, the subjects continuations shouldreflect the overall organization of the paragraph in terms of a miracle frame,and should therefore be quite different from the earlier two cases.9.6.1. Experiment 6AThree texts were developed. They appear in the appendix to this chapter. Eachof the 32 students was given a booklet containing three fragments, one from eachof the texts Eva, Complaints, and Brakes, and one from each of theconditions sentence alone, sentence framed, and sentence unframed. Subjectswere instructed to read each text carefully, and then to write down, in a sentenceor phrase, what they thought would be a likely continuation of the paragraphfragment they had just read. They were told that there were no correct answers,but that the experimenter was interested in their intuitions about these texts. Theywere also asked to rate their confidence in their response on a 5point scale, and,finally, to write down a word or brief phrase that in their opinion best indicatedthe topic of the text. Enough time was given to complete this test.The subjects responses were assigned to three classes those related to thesentencebased constraints, those related to the paragraph theme as well as sentenceconstraints, and other responses including failures to respond. Five percent of theresponses fell into this third category, which will be neglected in all further analyses. For the Eva paragraph, sentencebased constraints would lead subjects torespond with something that was in some way related to her illness a description,consequences, or treatment, whereas themebased constraints would elicit some326thing about miracles. Similarly, for the Brakes text, the sentence alone wouldelicit continuations concerned with driving a car or with wildlife, whereas in theframe context something about accidents was appropriate. The third text, Complaints, was somewhat different Out of context, the normal continuation woulddeal with some further specification of the complaints explanation, justification,etc. in context, however, if subjects were correctly organizing this text as a partof the method section of an experimental report, the continuation should dealwith the results of the experiment. Of course, this kind of organization could beexpected only to the extent that upperclass undergraduates are familiar with theconventions of the psychological report schema.The predicted shift in the expectations away from the sentencelevel constraints in the presence of a higher order organizational principle knowledgeframe or report schema was indeed obtained in the experiment Figure 9.1,Table 9.1. For the Eva text, the results almost perfectly corresponded to thepredictions All subjects continued with something about illness when theyread the sentence alone, and all but one did so when the sentence was read in theunframed context. In contrast, all subjects mentioned miracles in theircontinuation in the framed continuation. The Brakes text gave similar results,though they were somewhat attenuated. The Complaints text showed that thesubject population in this experiment was not really familiar with the reportschema The schema effect in this case was considerably reduced, compared withthe other two texts. In all cases, however, the obtained interaction effects werestatistically significant, with X22  19.63, 14.47, and 16.07 for Eva,Complaints, and Brakes, respectively, all significant at the .001 level.S P S P S PTEXT EVA COMPLAINTS BRAKESBENASSIFigure 9.1.

The most interestingthing here is the absence of a main effect for condition Averaged over the threetexts, subjects gave equally high ratings to their continuation responses, whetherthey worked from the sentence alone or with the framed or unframed text. This isinstructive Readers who do not have a global organization are not necessarilylostthey merely drop down a level and work with the more local constraints ofthe text. Unfortunately, this conclusion needs to be tempered a bit, because of thepresence of a significant text x conditions interaction in the confidence ratings, F4, 81  4.23, p  .004, which limits the generality of the claim just made. Theinteraction reflects mostly the low confidence subjects had in the framedcondition when they read the Complaints textthey were not at all sure aboutthe use of the report schema Presumably, with graduate students or faculty onecould get cleaner results with this text.The final measure collected in this experiment was topic generation. As Table9.3 shows, this measure parallels the expectation data in Figure 9.1, but is considerably less sensitive. Subjects gave much clearer data when asked to state theirexpectations than when asked to state a topic. The proportion for other or noresponses is .37 for the topic responses, compared with .08 for the expectationresponses. Similarly, the frame versus noframe interaction, although still present,Table 9.2Mean Confidence RatingsTextContextualcondition Eva Brakes ComplaintsAverage forthree textsAlone 3.09 2.64 2.62 2.78Unframed 2.80 2.38 2.91 2.66Framed 3.10 4.08 2.00 3.06328Table 9.3Percentage of Topic Choices Appropriate to Sentence and Paragraph Topics as aFunction of ContextTopic choiceContextualconditionSentencealoneParagraphtopicUnclassifiableor no responseAlone 71 4 25Unframed 21 3 76framed 6 81 13is reduced in magnitude. with a corresponding reduction in the statistical significance level only Eva is still significant at the .001 level Complaints issignificant at the .01 level, and Brakes only at the .05 level. Also, although theexpectations were practically identical in the sentence alone and the unframedconditions Table 9.1, the topics were perceived to differ. This certainly was thecase for the Complaints text p  .0002, but occurred to some extent also withEva p  .165 and Brakes p  .102. Clearly, stating expectations was abetter method for our purpose than choosing a topic.Experiment 6A confirms the chunking hypothesis If readers have available aglobal principle of organization such as a paragraph topic, they tend to base theirexpectations on it, rather than merely on local sentence properties. On the otherhand, if they cannot discern a global framework, they readily fall back on thesentence and use it to form some ideas about where the text is going. However,these conclusions are based on the responses of relatively few subjects, and on onlythree texts. Furthermore, the method of analysis used leaves open a number ofquestions, especially about the continuations in the unframed condition If they areunable to form a paragraph theme, readers revert to the sentence levelbut withlonger and more varied texts it would be surprising if they always chose to concentrate exclusively on the last sentence they had read. Thus, a replication of Experiment 6A was performed with new and more varied texts and a somewhatdifferent scoring scheme, in order to find answers to the questions raised here.9.6.2. Experiment 6BTen different texts were constructed on a variety of topics, both narrative anddescriptive. Each text was written in three versions only the last sentence wasthe same in all three versions. In the alone condition, the text consisted of the criticalsentence alone. In the framed condition, the target sentence came at the end of aparagraph 100150 words long which had a clear, easily identifiable theme thiswas verified informally by having several people identify the themes of the 10paragraphs. Finally, in the unframed condition, the target sentence came at the endof a 100150 word long paragraph that was globally incoherent, that is, that did not329possess an easily identifiable theme but consisted merely of a sequence ofloosely related or unrelated sentences.Sixtytwo subjects participated in the experiment in groups of 46 persons, 22in the alone condition and 20 each in the other two experimental conditions.Each subject received a booklet which contained all 10 texts, plus severalpractice texts. All texts in a booklet were presented in the same contextcondition. Subjects were assigned randomly to the three context conditions.Subjects in the unframed condition were warned that the texts they had to workwith were sometimes strange, but were asked to do as well as they could.Subjects were asked to reach each fragment carefully and to write down in asentence or phrase, what they thought a likely continuation of the paragraphfragment might be. The subjects were told to think of themselves as the author ofeach text and to produce what would be the most logical continuation. Thecontinuations were not to be generalizations or predictions but rather actualanticipated sentences or phrases. The subjects were informed that theexperimenters were interested in their intuitions about the texts and that therewere no correct answers. For each fragment, subjects were also asked to give aconfidence ratingranging from 1 no confidence to 5 very confidentto theirwritten continuations.The continuations produced by the subjects were scored by comparing themwith the words in the target sentence If a continuation involved only contentwords that already appeared in the target sentence or words that were judged tobe closely related thematically to the target sentence, the response was assignedto the category sentencealone. If a response contained content words unrelatedto the target sentence alone, it was classified as sentenceplus. In the framedcontext, this additional material could either be related to the paragraph topic, orit could be something else, either some detail from the earlier sentences in theparagraph, or an extra paragraph intrusion. In the unframed context, of course, allsentenceplus responses must belong to the latter two categories, and in the alonecondition only intrusion responses could be made.A single judge performed the scoring, with a second judge checking it. In 2of the cases responses could not be scored, or were missing.The results of the experiment are shown in Table 9.4. If readers have a wellTable 9.4Percentage of Continuations Based on Sentence Alone and SentencePlusParagraphas a Function of ContextBasis of continuationContextconditionSentencealoneSentenceplusparagraphUnclassifiableor no responseAlone 93 3 4Unframed 69 30 1Framed 10 89 1330formed paragraph to work with, their continuation responses are predominantlybased on material derived from that paragraph as a whole. Indeed, in such cases,of the 89Io of the responses in the sentenceplusparagraph column, 83oIo werebased on the paragraph theme, the other 6 on some other detail from theparagraph. In only 10 of these framed context cases was the paragraph themeneglected and the text continued on the basis of the last sentence only. Of course,if subjects were given only that last sentence, that was all they could do and didin fact do in only a few cases 3 did they use extraneous material unrelated tothe sentence. Subjects in the unframed condition were intermediate betweenthese extremes For the most part, they ignored the illformed, disorganizedparagraph and concentrated on the last sentence, just like subjects who only hadthis sentence to work with. On the other hand, we also find many responses thatare based wholly or partially on the paragraph. Thus, in 11 of all cases acontinuation was based on some salient detail picked up from an earlier sentencein the paragraph, and in 19 of the cases subjects used material from the targetsentence as well as from earlier sentences in the paragraph.As in Experiment 6A, there was a slight tendency to be more confident ofcontinuation responses in the framed context than in either the alone or unframedcontext, but once again the difference was small and did not reach statisticalsignificance, t 60  1.73, p  .09. The mean confidence ratings in the alone,unframed. and framed conditions were 2.46, 2.42, and 2.63, respectively.9.6.3. DiscussionThe results of these two experiments can be summarized quite simply. Ifsubjects read an incomplete text and are asked to write down a likelycontinuation for it, their responses depend on how much context they have, andhow good that context is. If they are working with a good, wellformedparagraph that has a clearly discernible framebased theme, they use that themefor continuing the text. If, on the other hand, they are given an illformed,disorganized paragraph, they do not have a frame to base their continuations onand must rely instead on some salient detail that they find in the paragraph. Mostoften, they simply use the last sentence, but sometimes they pick up a detail in anearlier sentence, or try to integrate the last sentence with earlier material in theparagraph. If all they have is a single sentence, they use it to construct acontinuation. The important point here is that in all these cases subjects producecontinuations readily, and with about the same level of confidence. They have abias for the paragraph theme however, if they do not have such a theme, they areby no means lost, but just revert to some sentencelevel detail.This simple observation has some theoretical significance, in that it allows usto identify an important constraint in discourse processing. The task of constructinga continuation for an incomplete text can be considered as an indicator for the waythe reader is organizing the text at that moment. The semantic units of a text areorganized on the basis of some propositional schema, and that propositional schema331provides a basis for constructing a plausible continuation of the text. Thus, if onereads a paragraph about miracles, the knowledge involved very likely is aboutmiracles, which has many possible elements, among them a lot for instancesof miracles if we then see a sentence that might be the precondition of a miracleEvas dying of peritonitis, we might very well regard it as part of thedescription of a miracle, and continue the text accordingly.On the other hand, if a reader receives an incoherent paragraph that cannot beorganized globally, some other basis for a continuation response must be found.for example, the last text proposition, or an earlier text proposition that containedsome salient detail.Thus, one can conclude that readers have a bias for global over localprinciples of organization when producing continuations of incomplete texts.Local constraints are, of course, not neglected otherwise the continuationssubjects produced would have been of an unsuitable level of generality andlocally inappropriate, which they were not. But the global constraint biased thelocal ones Of the many possible local continuations, the global constraintspicked out certain ones and suppressed others, even when they were the mostprominent ones in isolation. Although our production task doesnt permit us toconclude exactly which knowledge structures were activated in comprehension,it nevertheless supports the original hypothesis indirectly. Direct knowledgeactivation during comprehension will be needed to further investigate thisproblem.In concluding, we should point out that we have discussed this experimenthere from the perspective of knowledge utilization, but that we could havestressed equally well another aspect of this study the demonstration of thestrategic role of propositions in the comprehension and production of discourse.As we have emphasized with respect to the Newsweek example in the previoussection, global knowledge utilization and macrostructure formation are part ofone and the same process.APPENDIX TEXTS USED IN EXPERIMENT 6AText 1 EvaSentence aloneLast year, Eva Bcnassi became seriously ill with peritonitis.UnframedSettled amidst wooded hills in the back country of Ohio is the town of Plattsville.

We now turn to the question of how allthis can happen in real time. It is worthwhile at this point to remind ourselvesjust how complex all this really is. It borders on the miraculous how manysubtasks people perform, how many points they keep track of, and how manyconstraints they respect when comprehending discourseall normally withoutapparent effort, in a routine manner An incoming stream of sounds must be interpreted as phonemes, phonemecombinations as morphemes, and structured morpheme combinations asclauses. Meaning must be assigned to these various structures within a fewseconds per phrase as a maximum, and between 100 and 200 msec perlexical item at the fastest speed. At the same time, clauses must be connected in sentences, coherent connections among sentences must be established, and global macrostructures mustbe derived in order to determine the topic or theme of a passage. These interpretations depend on general or episodic world knowledge,which must be searched for, selectively activated, and instantiated.Knowledgebased inferences are necessary to establish local and globalcoherence. In addition and at the same time, the hearer must scan the communicativecontext for a large variety of data about the typical social situation, the speaker, the interaction types, and the speech act conditions. The interpretation of334these data, once again, depends on memory e.g., episodic memories about thespeaker. These various levels of interpretation are not independent but must belinked. Surface signals may be relevant not only for standard lexical orsyntactic interpretation, but will also be used to express macrostructures,speech act types, and various interactional properties. The same holds for theother relations between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. While busy with all this, the hearer must keep track of various pieces ofinformation needed to control the interpretational processes, such as the interactional frame e.g., this is a lesson, this is a trial, the macro speechact. the semantic macrostructure, schematic superstructures, and possibleother overall features, such as stylistic and rhetorical ones. Not only knowledge must be activated in the execution of these processes,but also opinions, attitudes, values, and emotions, for example, to evaluatethe content or intention of the discourse. Finally, but still simultaneously, the hearer has to keep track of his or herown wishes, interests, goals, and plans, which exert a monitoring functionon all the other components of the comprehension process.Somehow, we as scientists describing it have made a process that ourintuition tells us is quite simple and elegant look very complex. However, as wehave shown in the previous chapters of this book, all these factors do indeedinfluence comprehension and are involved in it in some way The phenomenalsimplicity of discourse comprehension hides a great deal. Furthermore, thecomplexity of discourse comprehension as we have analyzed it here does notnecessarily exceed that of other human actions not involving language. If wewould analyze an action such as walking across a crowded campus to a lecture inthe same detail as we have analyzed discourse comprehension here, the level ofcomplexity encountered would probably not be hugely different from that foundin discourse comprehension. Even seemingly simple behaviors require complexdescriptions and theories.The problem for the cognitive theorist is to design a system in which all ofthe subprocesses of discourse comprehension can occur and be coordinated,without violating known constraints on human information capacities.The most important constraints which we are concerned with here are memoryand processing constraints. Perceptual constraints are much better understood andneed not be considered here. Processing constraints have only recently been investigated in discourse comprehension and are as yet poorly understood for some initialwork, see Britton, Meyer, Hodge,  Glynn, 1980, and also Experiment 3, Section6.6. It appears that in principle cognitive processes can operate in parallel andunder certain circumstances without interfering with each other for a review of therelevant literature, see Kintsch, 1977aChapter 3. This parallel processing capacityis limited, however, in two ways, through resource and data limits. Data limitsoccur when a person cannot do something, no matter how favorable the circum335stances e.g., people cannot jump 100 m, nor can they solve expert physics problems without the appropriate knowledge base. Resource limits occur whensomething could be done in principle but not in the actual situation e.g., thesubjects in Experiment 3 could derive macrostructures, but for some difficulttexts they were unable to do so on first reading because they were overloaded bythe other components of the comprehension task. Resource limitations can becircumvented by automatizing behavior. Thus, a comprehension strategy thatmust be applied consciously and requires a special effort is of limited usefulness,because in many actual comprehension situations insufficient resources would beavailable for the application of such a strategy. On the other hand, wellpracticed, fully automatized strategies can run off in parallel without overloadingthe system.Research on the processing constraints of discourse comprehension will undoubtedly become a major focus of discourse studies in the coming years.Although we have certainly not done justice to this problem with this highlysuperficial discussion, we do not intend to follow it up here. Instead, we shallturn to the topic of memory constraints.Memory constraints are of two types. 1First, there is the wellknownlimitation of shortterm memory. Shortterm memory capacity is limited to aboutfour chunks in certain types of shortterm memory experiments Broadbent,1975, or to about two items in free recall experiments where fewer resourcescan be devoted to shortterm memory maintenance Glanzer  Razel, 1974.Mandler in press claims that consciousness is limited to a single idea. Clearlythere is no room in the shortterm memory box for all the information that mustbe processed and maintained in discourse comprehension, however we want tochunk it. Equally clearly. most of what is going on in discourse comprehensionis not conscious, and thus there is no reason to put it into the shortterm memorybox. What, then, is the role of shortterm memory in comprehensionThe second form of memory constraints that concern us here arise fromlimitations on retrievability. In order to retrieve an item from memory, theretrieval cue must match, at least partially, the encoded item. The cue must beappropriate for the encoding. The efficiency of memory is determined not byeither encoding or retrieval alone, but by the encodingretrieval interaction. Thisis the principle of encoding specificity of Tulving and Thomson 1973.The view we take of encoding here is a very simple one. Memory is a byproduct of processingone remembers what one does. The depth of processing andits elaboration are important because deeper, more elaborate processes leave moretraces that can later be recovered. Variable encoding leaves traces that can bematched by more retrieval cues. Thus, the nature of the encoding processes makesa great deal of difference for how well some experience will be recalled later Elaborate, semantic, meaningful encoding, and the embedding of experiences in a rich,1The question of whether it would be better to have a model with a single memorystore rather than o retain the shorttermlongterm distinction we shall disregard, becauseeven in a singlestoic model some provision must be made for an active, conscious core.336accessible matrix ensure memorability. Imagery plays a crucial role. We shalllater show that discourse comprehension quite naturally generates favorablecondition, for memory encoding.A retrieval cue is effective if it partially matches an encoded memory episodeThat memory episode may then be retrieved and reinstated in shortterm, activememory. However, retrieval effectiveness is usually not merely a matter of anisolated cue being successful or not, but of operating within a retrieval system. Insuch a system, a retrieval cue not only leads to the recovery of some desiredinformation in memory, but at the same time another retrieval cue is generatedthat allows more extended information recovery. Memory episodes which areintegrated into such systems are therefore much more likely to be retrievablethan unorganized, isolated memory traces. In what follows, we shall show thatdiscourse comprehension, by its very nature, leads to the establishment of wellintegrated retrieval systems, and hence to superior memory, especially whencompared to memory for unorganized word lists as used in classical studies ofmemory.Before we can consider these problems, however, we must add yet onefurther complication to our picture of discourse comprehensiona complicationthat becomes very important when we are dealing with questions of memory.The point is simply that, as far as memory is concerned, the purpose of discoursecomprehension is not usually memory for the discourse, but memory for whatthe discourse is about. This obvious fact has farreaching consequences whichwe need to consider in some detail before we can investigate further the memorydynamics of discourse comprehension.10.1. FROM THE TEXT REPRESENTATION TO THESITUATION MODELMost discourse processing models assume that during comprehension a language user gradually constructs a representation of the text in episodic memoryThis textual representation features, in principle, both surface, semantic andpragmatic information, as well as schematic superstructures. This textrepresentation, it is further assumed, has a hierarchical nature., such thatmicrostructures, organized by their linear connections form the terminalcategories.At various times in previous chapters we have pointed out the limitationsinherent in this view. In very general terms. the problem is that a text representationinvolves not only text elements, but also knowledge elements. How many of thesebecome part of the text representation In other words, is the text representation thekind of rich, elaborated structure that our intuition as well as our experiments tell usit can be, or is it more text bound Where do we draw the boundaries In this book,we have consistently opted for keeping the text representation relatively uncontaminated and unelaborated Only those inferences become part of it that are necessaryto establish coherence at the local or global level. Others have hypothesized muchricher text representations, including the discourse and its context as well as the337internal knowledge brought to bear during interpretation. Graesser 1981, for instance, has demonstrated how texts can become elaborated inferentially duringcomprehension. We propose that these elaborations, except for the ones that aretextually necessary as outlined in Chapter 5, are not part of the textrepresentation proper but of a model that the hearer or reader constructs aboutthe situation denoted by the text. It is this model which supplies and collects allthe relevant information for the adequate comprehension of the text. We havealready introduced this model informally and referred to it repeatedly, but wehave not yet discussed it in any systematic way.The distinction between a situational representation and a text representationis not an entirely new one. In our own work van Dijk, 1977a it evolved via thenotions of facts, possible worlds, and discourse models. Similar notionswere used by others, such as reference diaries by Clark and Marshall 1978,discourse referents by Karttunen 1976, discourse entities by NashWebber1978a, reference nets by Habel 1982, the textworld theory of Petfi1980, the discourse representations of Kamp 1981, and the mental modelof JohnsonLaird 1980. Although differing in detail, all of these notions aremotivated by the same insight that to understand the text we have to representwhat it is about. If we are unable to imagine a situation in which certainindividuals have the properties or relations indicated by the text, we fail tounderstand the text itself. If we do not understand the relations between the localfacts and the global facts to which the text refers, we do not understand the text.These claims follow directly from our discussion of the role of knowledgeuse in discourse comprehension. Using knowledge in discourse comprehensionmeans being able to relate the discourse to some existing knowledge structure,which then provides a situation model for it. The process is one of beingreminded of past situations, be they specific episodic or generalized semanticones Schank, 1979. Many of the discourses we interpret are about objects,persons, places, or facts we already know from past experience. In memory,these experiences form part of overlapping clusters of similar experiences. Tothe extent that they are episodic, they are, of course, subjective and differ fromperson to person. Thus, each person has subjective experiential clusters about thetown he or she lives in, the house, friends, place of work, and major life events.Similarly, each person shares, to some extent at least, other clusters ofexperiences about such items as countries, towns, historical events, politicalevents, or wellknown people. At the other extreme, as decontextualization setsin, these experiences become entirely general or almost so, such as onesknowledge of arithmetic or chess.We assume that during understanding such clusters are retrieved and form thebasis for a new model of the situation. Sometimes this model is directly ready foruse, sometimes it must be constructed from several partly relevant existing models.It has been suggested Carbonell, 1982 that reasoning by analogy provides powerful procedures for transforming existing but illfitting models into models that areadequate to the demands of a particular task. Thus, the understander is reminded bythe text of some prior experience, and then uses that experience to construct a model338of the present situation. Usually this requires transforming the old experientialstructure in some way, and Carbonell has discussed various operators that can beused to gradually transform an existing structure into a new one based on meansends analyses. In this respect discourse comprehension is a problemsolving task.The situation model that is constructed in this way is the basis for the interpretation of the text. It features all the knowledge that is left implicit in thetext or otherwise presupposed. General knowledge is treated exactly like specificexperiences in this respect Both may form the basis for situation models, andhence for the encoding of new experiences.10.1.1. Why a Situation Model Is NeededWe now turn to a number of specific linguistic and psychological argumentsto demonstrate that situation models are not merely plausible constructions, butare indeed necessary to account for the phenomena of discourse comprehensionand memory.Reference. In philosophy and linguistics it has been the custom to distinguishbetween meaning and reference see Chapter 4. We use words or referentialexpressions to refer to various types of elements, such as individual things orproperties, relations, and facts truth values in some possible world. Such adistinction has been lacking in psychology. The situation model fills this gap.The world, as it is referred to, is not cognitively relevant What we see or thinkabout is again some construction, namely, the situation model. It is therepresentation of that fragment of the world the text is speaking about. Of course,the text will leave unsaid much of this fragment, mainly because the heareralready has a lot of knowledge about it. On the other hand, the main semanticand pragmatic function of the text is to enrich the model to get to know things.This holds not only for semantic information in assertive contexts, but also forthreats, promises, and excuses These speech acts inform us about the wants,wishes, beliefs of the speaker with respect to our actions.This means that besides the properly semantic situation model, we alsoneed a communicative context model, representing speech acts and theirunderlying intentions, as well as other information about speaker, hearer, and thecontext. We may assume that it is this communicative context model that formsthe link between the situation model and the text representation The textrepresentation is, so to speak, the semantic content of the communicative act,of which the situation model is the referential basis. We will not be able tofurther explore here the precise nature of this communicative context model,though, nor its relations with the text representation or the situation model.Coreference. Expressions in discourse do not refer to other expressions or theirunderlying concepts in a text, but to individuals in the situation model. The expression my brother and the lawyer may have different conceptual meanings, butmay both refer to the same individual, say John. The situation model provides therepresentation of this same individual. The notion of coreference would make no339sense in a cognitive processing theory of comprehension if we did not have thisability to coordinate the text representation with a situation model. JohnsonLaird and Garnham 1980, Clark and Marshall 1978, Karttunen 1976, andWebber 1978a have elaborated this argument further, and it has been discussedhere in Chapter 5.Coherence. In our earlier work we have stressed that both local and globalcoherence depend on relations between propositions. Roughly speaking, atextbase is locally coherent if the facts referred to are connected, for example, byconditional or temporalcausal relations. Again, the real facts in the world areirrelevant for a cognitive theory, so we need a representation of them, that is, amodel. If in the model of the situation as it has been constructed by the hearer therepresented facts are connected, then this fragment of the text is coherent.Situational parameters. Similar arguments can be given for the role ofpossible world, time, and location parameters in discourse. We have seen thatthese often remain implicit in the individual sentences of a text. Sometimes theywill simply be presupposed, inferred from context information, or mentionedonly once in the text so that further sentences are interpreted under their scope.In a textual representation this kind of localization of propositions is not easy,and sometimes is impossible, to account for. In a model this would bestraightforward The model is precisely defined by such circumstanceparametersit is indeed a model of the situation.Perspective. Discourses may have different and changing perspectives orpoints of view Black, Turner,  Bower, 1979. That is, the facts or the situationare seen, interpreted, described, and talked about by different persons, fromdifferent points of view, etc. Yet, we know that the same facts are beingdescribed. This intuition can easily be accounted for if we have some stable pointof reference, hence a model of the situation which is more or less independent ofthe actual discourse and its point of view.Translation. Translation is not merely an operation that takes one surfaceform into another, and not even one that takes one text representation intoanother, but, rather, one that relates text representations via a situation model.This is easy to overlook when the two languages largely share the sameknowledge base, which therefore can be left as implicit in the second language asit was in the first language. But when this is not the case, for example, when thecultural code of the source language is widely different from that of the targetlanguagethen translation requires an explicit situation model before it can bemeaningfully completed. This point has been emphasized by Hutchins 1980,who translated a discourse among Trobriand Islanders involving an argumentabout land rights. The discourse is patently meaningless primitive,alogical, unless one related it to the underlying situation modelthe land rightsand customs on the Trobriand Islands, which are entirely foreign to us, but whichwere implicitly assumed by the participants. Then the discourse can be seen aswhat it really is a complex, coherent, logical piece of reasoning.Individual differences in comprehension. It is well known that two people canreceive the same information but derive from it two very different messages. In340part, this may involve the construction of somewhat different textrepresentations. Thus, in Chapter 6 we discussed how goals and interests couldlead readers to construct diverse macrostructures for the same text. Normally,there are fewer possibilities for distorting the microstructure of a text. However,interpretational differences need not be at the level of the text representations atall, but rather can be at the level of situation models. We hear the same message,but what we take it to mean is another thing. Literary texts often do not constrainthe situation model very tightly, giving the reader great latitude in constructinghis or her own model. Debates about what a classical text means are thereforefrequently not about the text proper, but about the situation model to beconstructed from it.Level of description. Ideally, texts are suitable for their audience Theypresuppose just the right amount so as not to bore the reader with superfluousinformation, but without omitting necessary information that the readers do nothave available. This leads to great economy in communication, as long as therequired knowledge base is shared. If it is nota situation in which, as Hutchins1980 points out, anthropologists and children are likely to find themselvesquite frequentlythen the level of discourse must be changed The situationmodel to be used must be conveyed in the discourse, together with theinformation to be communicated.Memory. There are some clearcut demonstrations in the psychological literature that under certain conditions people remember the situation model but notthe text representation. Usually this involves conditions in which the textrepresentation is very difficult to construct, perhaps because many very similarsentences are used, creating massive amounts of interference, so that thecomprehender skips the text representation and concentrates entirely on thesituation model, which typically is nice and simple e.g., Bransford  Franks,1972 Potts, 1972 Barclay, 1973. Thus, it is easy to remember that hawks aresmarter than bears which are smarter than lions which are smarter than wolvesbut it is almost impossible to remember a bunch of comparative sentences withthese arguments in various combinations. The only function these sentencesserve is to permit the listener to construct an appropriate situation model, but nota textbase which would be an extremely impoverished one in any case.An alternative way of showing that the situation model is remembered butnot the textbase involves giving subjects sentence pairs in which there areminimal distinctions in the textbase say, a difference of a single preposition butvery large ones in the situation model the single preposition makes thesituations described very different ones. In this case, too, subjects confuse thesentences, but not the situations Bransford, Barclay,  Franks, 1972 Garnham,1981.Conversely, there are situations where people remember the text but have nosituation model at all, as when children are taught to chant Hebraic texts or theKoran without understanding what they are saying. Typically, however, longtermmemory is poor in the absence of understanding, that is, a situation model, as isdemonstrated, for instance, by the wellknown findings of Bransford and Johnson1972. There are strong theoretical reasons why memory should be better for the341situation model than for the textbase itself Retrieval is most likely to occur if amemory episode is embedded within some larger structure which can serve as aretrieval system. Situation models, by their very nature, tend to be embedded insuch systems and form a part of a larger model, whereas the textbase itself ismore loosely associated with these structures, often via the corresponding model.In those cases, retrieval of the textbase would require the activation of the model,but not vice versa. This is, of course, not true in all cases, because it certainly ispossible to retrieve a textbase via some textual cue directly, but this seems to bethe exception rather than the rule. Furthermore, the textbase proper, once it hasfulfilled its main purpose as a stepping stone toward the situation model, willrarely be reactivated, whereas the corresponding model, if the information itcontains is of any importance at all to the individual, may be subject to extensiveuse and updating, as we shall see in what follows. This retrieval practice willgreatly strengthen the retrievability of the model Hogan  Kintsch, 1971whereas the textbase proper experiences no such advantage.Reordering. When people are told stories in which the order of events hasbeen disarranged, they often retell the story in its canonical order e.g., Kintsch,Mandel,  Kozminsky, 1977. There are two ways to explain this phenomenon,both of which implicate the situation model. First, it may be that in retellingpeople reconstruct the story from the situation model that they had formed whenthey heard it in scrambled form As they had available the appropriateknowledge schemata, they were able to construct a canonical model from thescrambled input, and in retelling they simply work from that model rather thanfrom the text representation proper. Alternatively, it might be the case that thetext representation itself was unscrambled and put into the correct order, in spiteof the disorderly input. However, the only way this unscrambling could be donewas to construct a situation model in canonical form, and then to use this modelto rearrange the textbase. In either case, the reordering of scrambled narrativespresupposes the construction of a situation model.Crossmodaliry integration. It is frequently the case that information fromtextual and nontextual sources must be integrated. The situation model, whichmay be modified either through direct perception and action or through adiscourse, forms a much needed link between modalities.Problem solving. The situation model plays a particularly significant role whensome sort of action is to be taken on the basis of reading a text, such as in problemsolving. The basis for problem solving is not the textbase directly, but the modelderived from it. Problemsolving techniques, such as mathematics and logic, applyto the model, but not to natural language itself. Logic, therefore, is not an appropriate formalism for the representation of language. Language merely provides thecues that indicate what 5ort of a model needs to be constructed, and comprehendersinterpret these cues strategically, as we have shown in the previous chapters. Thesituation model which is the result of this interpretational process provides the basisfor further cognitive operations, such as formal, logical reasoning, as well as other342types of inference and problemsolving activities. In the final section of thischapter we shall describe a case where the situation model provides the base forthe application of arithmetical operations as occurs in solving word problems inarithmetic.Updating and relating. These are two of the most important functions forwhich the situation model is used. Text representations are related to otherelements in memorygeneral knowledge as well as personal experiences to alarge extent via their corresponding models. Thus, they participate in thememory network which determines their further use via the models that werecreated from them. Specifically, it is not always the case that each text leads tothe construction of a new and separate situation model. Rather, very frequentlyan already existing model is modified on the basis of a new text. This occurs, forinstance, in knowledge updating on the basis of news reports. Thus, what wenow remember about such highly publicized events as, for instance, Watergate isa frequently updated, often modified situation model that integrates manydifferent experiences, and includes not only declarative statements, but alsoopinions, attitudes, emotionsand even a moral, perhaps. Given the immenseimportance of knowledge updating, experimental research as well as theoreticalwork in this area is merely in its initial stages. Some interesting work on memoryupdating on the basis of news reports has been done by Larsen 1982 andFindahl and Hijer 1981, and the theoretical implications of updating havebeen explored via a simulation program by Kolodner 1980.Learning. Last but not least, the concept of a situation model is required as abasis for learning. Learning from text is not usually learning a text. Learning canbest be conceptualized as the modification of situation models. Exactly whichmodifications deserve the name learning, how such modifications are broughtabout, what the mechanisms and constraints are, are questions beyond the scopeof this book. Yet, learning theory, after a long hiatus is once more coming to theforefront within cognitive science e.g., J. R. Anderson, 1982. All we can hopeis that the theory of discourse comprehension that we have presented here willprovide a firm basis for investigating how learning from text proceeds. For boththeoretical and practical reasons, this is potentially one of the most importantdirections this type of research could take.10.1.2. Why Textbases Are Needed, TooThe reasons why a situation model is needed, summarized in the precedingsection, make convincing reading. Indeed, they make such a strong argument fora situation model that one is tempted to radically simplify the model of discoursecomprehension by throwing out altogether the text representation proper. Do wereally have to bother with a multileveled propositional textbaseCould we notmerely have the words on the one hand and the situation model on the otherWhat role does the text representation playLet us first discuss a few reasons why surface structure representations arenecessary components of a textbase3431. Discourses do not merely express meanings or refer to facts and theirelements and relations, they do so in a specific, linguistic way. Forseveral reasons it is necessary to store episodically these surfacestructures. For grammatical operations beyond the sentence boundary,the precise surface structure of a previous sentence may still be relevant.2. Discourses may have a specific style Even if the facts we speak aboutare the same, the way we speak about them may be different. Suchstylistic features will receive semantic, pragmatic, and interactionalinterpretations and language users, throughout a text and also longafter, will have access to this particular style and its features, directly orthrough retrieval of their relevant semantic or interactional functions.3. Discourses may have a number of rhetorical operations, at each level.Again, these are not so much intended as indicators or expressors offacts, but rather as communicative devices to make the discourse moreeffective. And again, language users may have separate recall of suchrhetorical devices as rhyme, alliterations, metaphor, etc.However, as we have seen throughout the previous chapters, comprehensionprocesses cannot be restricted to surface structures but involve conceptualprocesses based on propositional representations1. Discourses sometimes have a specific superstructure schema. Whethercanonical or transformed, the schema will often be independent of thefacts denoted, and pertain rather to the global ordering ofmacrosemantic or macropragmatic information.2. Also at the global level, as we observed in previous chapters see, e.g.,Chapter 8, there are possible reorderings in the presentation ofpropositions, according to cognitive, pragmatic, stylistic, rhetorical, orinteractional constraints. Again, these reorderings are not so muchdependent on the facts, as on the way these are presented to the hearer.3. What has been said earlier about perspective also holds the other wayaround If the facts are the same, we may still describe them fromvarious points of view, and people do have access to these differentperspectival descriptions.Thus, the need for the text representation proper is twofold On the one hand, itis a necessary station on the way toward the situation model. At least in this theory,we simply could not construct explicitly a situation model without the interveningstructure of the propositional text representation. It is doubtful whether other theories can circumvent this intermediate stage, without introducing some notationalvariant through the back door. On the other hand, however, we need to separate thetext representation from the situation model because the representation of the textand the representation of the situation do not always coincide. The text representation may very well have its own, distinct existence in memory. Just as one normally344remembers the situation the text refers to rather than the text itself, one can andoften does remember the text per seits organization, its macrostructure whichmay but need not share important features with the structure of the situation. Forcognitive scientists it is crucial to be clear about what we attribute to the text andderived structures which are text specific, such as the propositional textbase, andwhat we attribute to the world. It will not do to confuse the two.10.1.3. On the Representation of Situation ModelsWe have mentioned a number of arguments in favor of situation models.Such arguments at thesame time provide criteria for an adequate theory ofsituation models The criteria should allow the various phenomena and processesto be formulated in terms of the structure and the use of such models. Here wecannot aim at a complete theory of episodic situation models, but somesuggestions might nevertheless serve as preliminaries for such a theory. We haveseen that a situation model is an integrated structure of episodic information,collecting previous episodic information about some situation as well asinstantiated general information from semantic memory. Also, in discoursecomprehension, the situation model should allow updating, and, finally, situationmodels should form the basis for learning. Since the previous inputs, as well asthe generalized output, and the way the information is used in variable tasks, willalways be rather different in structure, we must assume that a situation modelalso has a schematic nature. Just like scripts or frames, it should allow forvariable terminal categories. This is an expedient hypothesis, for it allows us ato instantiate part of scripts or frames to become the backbone of a situationmodel, and, conversely b to proceed easily from a situation model to a moreabstract, decontextualized script or frame through a process of learning. Indeed,if we have once taken a plane, we will not yet have a script, but a uniquesituation model of that episode see Schank  Abelson, 1977, for an episodicillustration of the formation of scripts in children. Later experiences of the samekind will complete, correct, and further fill in such an experiencebased schema.In other words, the situation model is different from a frame or script in that it ismuch more personal, based on ones own experiences, and therefore it willfeature all kinds of details which, in learning, will be abstracted from. Let usassume for the moment, then, that such an episodic trace of previous informationis about a complex event, that is, about some episode, like a car accident. Eitherbecause we have participated in such an accident, or because we have seen one,or because we have heard a story about one, we will have formed arepresentation of such a complex event. Later events of the same kind will, inpart, remind us of that earlier event. According to our theory of complexinformation processing, this earlier experience will probably no longer beavailable in all its details. More probably, the earlier event will merely beretrievable at a macrolevel. In other words, a situation model will mainly beformedand updatedby previous macropropositions from perception, action, ordiscourse plus some occasional details.It is rather tempting to hypothesize that the structure of situation models is345formed by a frame similar to the propositional frame we have discussed inChapter 4 at the top a predicate, filled with the information having an accident,and followed by a list of participants, for example, in such a way that the agentrole can be filled by the person him or herself I, possibly followed by otherparticipants. The event is then localized in place, time, and conditions. Note thatthe macroproposition representing previous information may be less complete,and, for instance, not feature these other participants or further circumstantialinformation. The situation model, however, would have a full schema, and laterexperiences can fill in these still empty categories. Since we have assumed thata propositional schema has atomic propositions as its terminal units, furtherexperiences about similar events accidents can simply be added, aspropositions, to these terminal categories. Of course, we may assume that thesepropositions are somehow ordered. First, there may be a recency ordering, whichplaces the newest information in each category on top of the stack. But there mayalso be a relevance ordering We will surely better remember our own accidentof 5 years back than one we read about in the paper 5 days ago which mighteven be understood without accessing these personal memories about ouraccident. In any case, the information under some final categories may in itsturn become so complex that it will itself be summarized again in somemacroproposition We may group experiences of accidents in some class, and thesame for likely locations of accidents. Note that details of each situation can beeasily inserted into such a model frame Further properties of participants can beinserted under the final participant categories, and the same holds for theproperties of the event itself, of the location. Similarly, we have inversemacrorules which allow us to specify the macroevent into preparatory orconditional events, component events, and consequences.This kind of format for the situation model can easily be retrieved and fitswell with our other assumptions. When understanding a text, we first of all wantto establish a provisional macroproposition. That macroproposition will be anexcellent retrieval cue to find the macroproposition dominating the complexsituation model. And, conversely, the many information chunks obtained fromthe current text will be neatly inserted into the respective relevant categories ofthis situation model, at different macrolevels.It may further be assumed that recent or frequent use of a situation model willallow the understander to retrieve relatively more details of the previous situation.Also, as soon as the situation model is used more frequently, all the different detailsin its terminal categories cannot beand usually need no longer beavailable forlater understanding. In that case, generalization and decontextualizationthat is,learningtakes place We form a frame or script for this kind of situation. Withfurther use, such a general script or frame or MOP may be much easier to handle,by simple instantiation, and may supply all relevant instantiated details togetherwith the new information about the actual situation. In that case, only some recent,or very relevant, past experiences may still be needed for retrieval from previousstates of the situation model. Thus, in order to be able to take the subway in NewYork I simply need a taking a subway script or frame, if I have one, and supply346now relevant specific information about the situation. But at the same time, I mayeven if I take the subway dailybe reminded of yesterdays trip when I met thisstrange man, or last years when there was a fire in the subway. If I do not have aframe or script, I may well be reminded of the rather vague and remote i.e.,macro information from the model I built when some years ago I took thesubway in New York, or from situations that were similar taking the subway inParis.Another point concerns the possible uniqueness of situation models. Are theyonly models of one unique situation, about which we just acquire furtherinformation e.g., the actual civil war in El Salvador, or is a situation model aflexible schema allowing for a collection of similar situations The latteralternative seems more plausible that episodic memory is not just anunorganized collection of a myriad of situation models, but, rather, that similarexperiences are grouped together. This does not mean, though, that we are notable to selectively retrieve some specific situation from memory We may do soeither by selectively retrieving details from the terminal categories of thesituation model or by retrieving the textual or other representation we had aboutthat specific eventif still retrievable. Only an integrated conception of situationmodels allows efficient search of similar information, and possiblegeneralization in processes of learning. The theory of macrostructures providesus with the strategic processes for the organization and retrieval of variousevents under the same macropropositions.As yet, we know very little about the conditions that favor or inhibit theconstruction of situation models from texts. Earlier we reviewed some studiesthat suggest that if texts are very confusing, though the situation they describe issimple. readers will dispense with the text representation and concentrate on themodel. One would imagine accordingly that simple texts describing complex andobscure situations would invite concentration on the textbase at the expense ofthe model.10.2. A FRAMEWORK FOR A PROCESS MODELWith the discussion of the situation model, we now have all the parts that weneed to consider in building process models of discourse comprehension. It is, ofcourse, senseless to suppose that there can be a single process model of discoursecomprehension. In Chapter 1 the inherent vagueness of the termcomprehension was discussed. There are many modes in which discoursesmay be comprehended. All we can do here, therefore, is merely to present aframework for a processing model, instructions, so to speak, for building such amodel in some concrete, wellconstrained situation. Comprehension models forspecific, concrete situations can and must be explicit, complete, and testable.However, the general framework that we are concerned with here mustnecessarily remain vague and underdetermined as it must apply to the wholevariety of behaviors that we label discourse comprehension. We shall outline theframework we propose here and then, in Section 10.5, show how it can be usedto design a specific process model in a concrete experimental situation.347We are merely summarizing here what has already been said or implied invarious places in this book. Figure 10.1 illustrates the essence of the processingmodel we are proposing. It contains once more the multiple levels ofrepresentation and processing that are involved in discourse comprehension andthat have figured importantly in all our discussions so far. This time, however,the question is how these multiple levels are processed and coordinated in realtime. The momenttomoment flow of processing in comprehension isrepresented in the figure by the central circle. Surrounding this stage we have avariety of interacting memory systems.Basically, there are three major classes of surround systems. First, there is asensory register which briefly holds the incoming perceptual information and makesit available to the central processor. Standard current formulations of this processFigure 10.1. A sketch of the operation of the memory system in discourse comprehension. The circlerepresents working memory, containing words and propositions Pk is currently under constructionwhile the previous proposition Pk1 is held in the limited capacity buffer.348are entirely adequate for our purposes for a review of this literature, see Kintsch,1977a Chapter 3. Note that at any point in time only certain perceptual featuresare available to the processor.Second, there is the comprehenders longterm memory. For our purposes wedo not need to make a clear distinction between general knowledge on the onehand and personal experiences on the other. As we have stressed repeatedly, onemay serve as a relevant knowledge source in comprehension as well as the other.They differ only in the conditions under which they are retrievable, not in theway they are used in comprehension. Several of these knowledge structures arepresumed to be active at each moment, for example, the lexical knowledgerequired by the words being processed and larger knowledge systems formingscripts or frames which serve as the basis for the propositional structure that isbeing generated. Chapter 9 was devoted to exploring the details of the processesby means of which knowledge is used in comprehension. We have also added tolongterm memory, somewhat arbitrarily, the comprehenders goals andpurposes, wishes, interests, and emotions, namely, the active control structure.The third component is the memory representation that is being constructed,the episodic text memory as well as the situation model. As far as the episodictext memory is concerned, we distinguish surface memory, the propositionaltextbase, and the macrostructure. Other relations within and across the differentmemory areas in Figure 10. I have not been represented explicitly. The memoryrepresentations of the text that are being constructed can be thought of as pushdown stacks, with always new elements being added at the boundary, pushingthe older elements farther and farther away. Thus, retrieval by recency cues aloneof these elements is workable only for the last few in each stack. However, theitems in the stack are not only ordered by recency, they are heavily interrelatedamong each other at least the propositional representations and the model of thesituation, and they are also coordinated with corresponding elements in theparallel structures. Thus, items can be retrieved not merely via recency cues, butalso via their relationships with other items, both within the same stack and inparallel stacks. Because the situation model is the most heavily interrelated andintegrated structure, it remains most retrievable when recency cues are no longereffective. At the other extreme, verbatim surface memory is retrievable only viarecency cues, via coordinated propositions, or by some partial matching thatmakes available surface memory chunks. A real retrieval system for surfacememory is lacking. The propositional structure, including the macrostructure, onthe other hand, is a coherent, interrelated network, where one proposition leadsto another, forming an effective retrieval system.Surrounded by these memory systems we find in the center of Figure 10.1 thecentral processor. All cognitive operations take place in this processing unit. Thus,in order to modify any element from one of the memory systems that were describedbefore, the element must be brought into the central processor. Retrieval is theonly operation that can be performed on memory elements outside it.The central processor consists of a core and a boundary. Although there are nolimits on the amount of processing that can be done in the central register except forresource limits, as mentioned briefly earlier, there are serious limits on howmuch information can be maintained in an active state in the working register.349These are the wellknown capacity limits of shortterm memory. As Figure 10.1indicates, we assume that in general shortterm memory is able to maintain thechunk that is currently being processed, plus some carryover information fromthe previous chunk to establish coherence. The current chunk consists of thecomplex proposition Pk which contains a number of atomic propositions P, asdiscussed in Chapter 4. Each of the atomic propositions was derived from certaintext fragments, denoted W in Figure 10.1. In general, as we have shown inChapter 4, a complex proposition Pk often corresponds to some phrase orsentence unit at the linguistic level. Hence, what we find in shortterm memoryat any point in time during comprehension is the surface representation of themost recent one or two phrases or simple sentences, and the atomic propositionsderived from it which are bound together on the basis of some knowledgeschema to form the propositional unit P. In addition, a shortterm buffer containssome residual information from the previous text proposition, Pk1  In general,this will not be the whole unit, including all its subordinated atomic propositionsand the actual linguistic forms from which these were derived, but somestrippeddown version of Pk1. As P is based on a knowledge structure a frameor script constructed for that purpose, as discussed in Chapter 9, an efficientstrategy would be to carry over only the main slots of Pk1, deleting inessentialinformation such as that assigned to modifier positions in the schema.One cannot be more precise about the principles governing the operations ofthis buffer at this point, because they may be strategy controlled and differ tosome extent in different situations. However, consider the following example.Suppose we have comprehended the sentence On a stormy afternoon, Lucyoverturned her new sailboat just outside Sausalito harbor as an accident,arriving at the following complex proposition so as not to distract from the mainissue, the notation here is entirely informalACCIDENT overturn Lucy, sailboatVEHICLE sailboatnewPERSON LucyTIME on X, afternoonstormyLOCATION outside X, harborjust SausalitoSuppose that the buffer is limited to three atomic propositions a reasonable numberin light of some of the estimates obtained in previous work using the Kintsch  vanDijk, 1978, model. In that case, the top three slots in the complex propositionwould be retainedspecifying the nature of the accident, and the vehicle andperson involved. Modifiers would be discarded, and in this case also the time andlocation slots. Also discarded are the linguistic surface expressions from which thepropositional information was computed. Discarded here means merely discardedfrom shortterm memorytraces will, of course, be laid down in episodic text350memory. Thus, if the next sentence She got away with a scare, but the expensivenew boat was badly damaged is read, it now can be interpreted in terms of theaccident proposition still available in shortterm memory, establishing coherencebetween these two sentences. If more previous information is needed to interpretan incoming sentence, a reinstatement search of episodic text memory must bemade to retrieve it. In our example, if the text continued not with Lucy and herboat, but about the afternoon, whichit will be rememberedwas not retained inan active state, for instance, On the same afternoon, three other boats sank in thebay, a reinstatement search for the time slot would be necessary. Because thatsearch has as its target the immediately preceding sentence, it would certainly besuccessful and probably would require few resources, unlike a search forinformation several sentences away, where recency cues can no longer be reliedon for retrieval.As has been pointed out many times here, texts are not processed merely inthe context of some schematic representation of the previous sentence or phrasethere are many other factors that actively affect processing. These we have put atthe boundary of the shortterm memory central processor and the surroundingmemory systems. The term control system will be used for these active elements.At any point in time, various knowledge structures are active in comprehension.They are not part of shortterm memory, but they influence it. The same is trueof the goals and interests that control the whole comprehension episode, andmost importantly for the textbase itself. The most recently constructedmacroproposition influences ongoing processing at other levels at all times quitedirectly without having to be brought into shortterm memory by some retrievaloperation. Like an active knowledge structure it is directly available to theprocess. Similarly, the most recent component of the situation model is directlyavailable and constrains and controls the processes that are going on centrally.Of course, when new macropropositions are formed, or new versions of thesituation model are constructed, these processes occur centrally, too, though oncemore under the influence of the previous model or macroproposition whichparticipates in the new constructions from its position on the boundary of thesystem.Why have we put this control system at the boundary and not made it a fullmember of the inner circle Mostly because we would like to think of the centralprocessing unit as having some of the properties of shortterm memory as well as ofconsciousness. We know that many more elements have to participate in discourseprocessing than there is room for in a capacitylimited shortterm memory, even ifwe are most generous with our estimates. Theoretically, this might be a goodargument for the claim that the capacitylimited shortterm store of the traditionalmemory literature has no place in a model of discourse comprehension. That,however, would destroy much of the predictive power of our model, in the earlierKintsch and van Dijk 1978 version as well as in its present form, as will be shownin Section 10.5. Furthermore, it would be hard to reconcile such a step with the dataon shortterm memory use in discourse comprehension, as we shall argue in the nextsection of this chapter. A better solution to our dilemma appears to be the one wehave chosen, namely, to combine features of shortterm memory and351consciousness in the tradition of William James. Consciousness, according toarguments by Mandler in press, contains one idea at a time. In the context ofdiscourse comprehension it appears quite reasonable to identify an idea with acomplex proposition. Consciousness, however, always has been considered tohave a boundary where ideas are available quite directly, but of which one is notactually conscious. This is clearly the case with knowledge structures indiscourse comprehension The v are used, but one is not normally conscious ofthem. Similarly, goals, and even the topic and main themes of the text itself themacrostructure and the situation model. are not actually in consciousness,though they actively influence the way we understand the discourse, and thoughthey can be brought into focus any time. What we are normally conscious of arethe words and their meaning. Hence we suggest that the central processing unitin Figure 10.1 consists of an active, conscious. but strictly capacitylimited core,and a boundary area containing the control system where memory structuresaffect processing in the core without being directly conscious and without beingsubject to capacity limitations. Knowledge structures beyond that boundary, thatis, beyond the active macropropositions, frames, and goals, can participate indiscourse processing only if they are successfully retrieved.Our discussion of Figure 10.1 raises numerous questions. However, there islittle point in pursuing these questions in a general way here, because they areprobably not answerable at a general level. What we need to do is to investigateexperimentally shortterm memory processes in discourse comprehension inspecific, wellconstrained situations, and to build specific, explicit models forthose situations. Only in that way is there some hope of coming to grips withthese endlessly complex phenomena. But in order to build specific models wefirst need the general framework, if we want to avoid ad hoc solutions.We need to remark briefly on the relationship between the present processingmodel and our previous one presented in Kintsch and van Dijk 1978. The 1978model can be considered as a specific submodel within the present framework.Essentially, it is not a different model, but rather a simplified version that omitsand shortcuts much of what we want to explicate here. Now, we are explainingin detail how complex propositions are constructed, what is retained in shortterm memory and why. All these processes are treated as functions of howknowledge is used in comprehension. In our previous model, we havecircumvented these problems via some formal rules and statisticalapproximations. Likewise, all processing was assumed to occur in cycles,whereas now we assume that all words are processed on line, though cycles stillplay a role in shortterm memory use, as complex propositions are usuallyformed in shortterm memory at sentence and phrase boundaries. just as in the1978 model. Indeed, for some purposes the 1978 model might still be quitesatisfactory, for example, if one is not concerned with some of the fine grain ofthe processes, but is content with relatively gross analyses of memory, forgetting, summarizing, and the like. Thus, the present work does not necessarilyreplace the 1978 model, for all its limitations.35210.3. SHORTTERM MEMORY USE INDISCOURSE PROCESSINGIn this section we want to argue that the classical shortterm memory conceptas it has evolved from many laboratory studies with nondiscourse materials is auseful explanatory concept for understanding discourse processing. Thus, wewant to provide a justification for our choice to give shortterm memory a centralplace in the processing model for discourse.Traditionally, the two main features of shortterm memory have been itscapacity limits Miller. 1956 Simon, 1974 Broadbent. 1975 and quick accesswhich does not require complex retrieval schemes Sternberg, 1966. However,when we use the term shortterm memory as in Figure 10.1, we assign it not onlystorage functions, but also processing functions It is both a central workingregister and a store for maintaining information. The term working memory isoften used for this type of active shortterm system e.g., Baddeley  Hitch,1974. The capacity limits in such a dual function system cannot be defined withrespect to only one of its functions instead, the two functionsprocess andstoragemust be thought of as competing for capacity. n a memory span testwhere processing is minimal, most of the available capacity can be devoted tostorage and hence a memory span of 72 items is obtained, whereas in a freerecall test encoding for longterm retention must compete with shorttermstorage resulting in a much smaller shortterm capacity, around 2 items.Similarly, if processing is minimized, approximately equal estimates for theshortterm memory capacity of children and adults are obtained, but adults aremuch more efficient processors in general, so that in most tasks where storagemust compete for resources with processing, adults can maintain more items inshortterm memory than can children Chi, 1976 Huttenlocher  Burke, 1976.Similarly, there are no significant differences in the shortterm memory capacityof good versus poor readers when traditional memory span measures areconsidered where reading skills are quite irrelevant, but if memory span ismeasured within a reading task, comprehension scores and memory span arehighly correlated Daneman  Carpenter, 1980. For instance, readers ability toidentify pronoun referents in a text several sentences back correlated r  .90 withtheir rearding span, a measure which Daneman and Carpenter defined as themaximum number of sentences for which subjects are able to recall accuratelythe last word.One would also expect good shortterm memory to be correlated with goodlongterm memory. Longterm memory depends heavily on how well the toberemembered material was organized, that is, encoded in interrelated memorychunks. In order to form a chunk, separate items have to be brought together inshortterm memory e.g., Kintsch, 1970 Jacoby, 1974 Shiffrin  Schneider,1977. Hence, better shortterm memory means bigger chunks and better longterm memory.Experimental studies concerned with the use of shortterm memory in discourse comprehension are still rare, but there is a small body of information avail353able. First, there is the wellknown work of Jarvella 1971, 1979, which established the relevance of sentence and clause boundaries for the shorttermretention of discourse. Jarvella used a running memory span measure that is, asequence of sentences was interrupted at some point and the subject was asked torecall verbatim as many words as could be remembered. Subjects usuallyrecalled the last clause, and sometimes the one before that, with sharp breaks inrecall performance occurring at the clause boundaries, indicating that thesyntactic structure of sentences was used by subjects in scheduling the discoursefor shortterm maintenance. On the average, somewhere between one and twosimple sentences were retained verbatim in shortterm memory. Glanzer,Dorfman, and Kaplan 1981 obtained similar estimates. Indeed, simplesentences in these experiments appear to function much like items such as singlewords in traditional listlearning experiments, where comparable estimates forthe number of items retained in shortterm memory have been obtained Glanzer Razel, 1974.Glanzer et al.  198 l  also demonstrated that procedures that arc traditionallyused to interfere with shortterm memory retention have their expected effectswhen the material to be retained is discourse. In one of their experiments,subjects read eight sentences, but had to do addition problems after eachsentence before they were allowed to proceed to the next one. One would expectthis intervening activity to interfere with shortterm retention and hence to forcesubjects to rely on retrieval from longterm episodic text memory, which mightlead either to poorer comprehension or to longer reading times if the subjects arecompensating. The latter effect was actually observed in their experiment.Glanzer et al. also had subjects do a counting task while they were reading thesentences. This had even stronger effects on performance, lengthening readingtimes as well as lowering comprehension scores. Thus, shortterm memoryappears to play a role in discourse that is very similar to what is normally foundin laboratory experiments with word lists.This similarity does not merely reflect the fact that Glanzer et al. were doinga laboratory experiment, too, albeit one involving discourse, for the sameconclusions follow from some observations reported by Levelt and Kelter 1982who were working in a much more naturalistic situation. These authors studiedhow shopkeepers in Nijmegen answered simple questions that were put to themover the telephone The wording of the answer tends to reflect the wording of thequestion. Levelt and Kelter investigated in some detail the memory dynamics inthis situation. How does the respondent remember the form of the questionbecause remembered it must be if it is to be used as a model for the answerBy adding various irrelevant statements after a question, they could demonstratethat the form of the question is normally retained in shortterm memory, but ifshortterm memory is interfered with, the form may occasionally still beretrievable from longterm memory, which leads to a greatly diminishedcongruence effect in answering the questions. Control experiments ruled out thepossibility that the congruence is not a true memory phenomenon, but merely theresult of plausible reconstruction in the context of the situation in which thequestions were asked.Thus, shortterm memory in these discourse studies appears to have much the354same properties as in listlearning research. What we do not yet know is actuallywhat the information is that is being held in shortterm memory. The literaturesuggests an acoustic coding bias, but it is clear that although it is easiest andusually preferred to maintain information in shortterm memory in an acousticphonological form, this is by no means necessary. Imagery or abstract semanticinformation may be retained in shortterm memory if the task requires it thismaterial is reviewed in Kintsch, 1977a. This is probably also the situation indiscourse. Jarvella, Glanzer et al., and Levelt and Kelter have examined onlyverbatim memory, and as far as these studies are concerned it is quite possiblethat what is retained in shortterm memory is a linguistic surface structure,probably phonologically coded. Glanzer et al. explicitly entertain this possibility.Our model, of course, requires that in addition to the surface structure, shorttermmemory also contain a propositional representation of a discourse fragment.As one cannot test for propositions directly, but must necessarily workthrough the medium of language, it is hard to separate experimentally the twolevels o1 representation. A study by Fletcher 1981, however, suggests thatshortterm memory is not merely a matter of maintaining surface forms. Heshows that propositions predicted by the Kintsch and van Dijk 1978 model tobe retained in the shortterm buffer are in fact in shortterm memory, even whenthey come from a previous clause. Correspondingly, propositions from the sameprevious clause that according to the model are not held over in the buffer areunavailable in shortterm memory. It is hard to see how this selective shorttermretention of information from a clause could be explained without recourse to ananalysis in terms of propositions.Because Fletchers work is of particular importance here, we shall review it insome detail. Fletcher 1981 worked with the same set of texts that were used byMiller and Kintsch 1980 in their recall and readability study. As part of that study,computer simulations were run for each text according to the Kintsch and van Dijkmodel. Among other things, these simulations specified which propositions were inthe shortterm buffer at each point in the comprehension process. Fletcher devisedseveral experimental tests to evaluate the accuracy of these predictions. Two procedures were used cued recall and recognition. In both cases, subjects read a textwhich was displayed phrase by phrase on a screen and was interrupted at predetermined intervals for a shortterm memory test. On cued recall tests, a content wordfrom the text just read was repeated and the subject was asked to respond with thecontent word that followed it in the text. On recognition texts, an oldnew recognition response was required. Cue words were selected either from the last cyclewhich is always assumed to be available in shortterm memory according to themodel, the nexttothelast cycle, or an earlier cycle. Words from earlier cycleswere not predicted by the model to be in the buffer and, indeed, were chosen sothat, according to the model, they would never even be selected for the buffer thesewords formed the longterm memory control material. Words from the nexttolastcycle were of two kinds words from propositions that were maintained in the bufferat the time the interruption occurred, according to the model, and words frompropositions not in the buffer according to the model. If the model was right, the355Table 10.1Recall, Recognition and Response Time for Words from TextPercentage correctCued recall Recognition Response time msecLast cycle 61 91 1234Nexttolast in buffer 45 70 1385Nexttolast unselected 27 67 1462Prior cycles unselected 30 68 1478After Fletcher, 1981.The top two lines arc predicted to be available in the shortterm memory buffer, thebottom two lines are not.latter should behave exactly like the longterm memory control words from earlierportions of the text, because they had to be retrieved from longterm memory justlike the earlier words. On the other hand, words from propositions predicted tobe still in the buffer should have an advantage, just like the words from the finalcycle, because both are available in shortterm memory at the time of testing.Table 10.1 shows that these predictions were generally confirmed inFletchers experiments. Words no longer in the buffer from the nexttothelastcycle were comparable to the longterm memory control words Cued recallperformance, recognition, and response times are almost identical for the last twolines of the table. In contrast, words from the nexttothelast cycle that themodel predicts to be still available in the buffer led to better recall andrecognition, and to faster response times, as one would expect. These measures,however, were not quite up to those for the words from the very last cycle Hereeven better recall and recognition were observed, and response times were evenlower. Though both types of words referred to propositions available in thebuffer, the words themselves were available in the buffer only for the last cyclein which the whole phrase or sentence was still maintained for the nexttothelast cycle, all that the buffer contained were some especially importantpropositions which were retained for the sake of providing a coherence linkbetween processing cyclesthe actual surface forms were no longer active inshortterm memory. Thus, responses for words from the final phrase wereespecially accurate and quick because they could be based either on surfacememory or on the propositional representation, whereas for the nexttolast cycleonly the latter was still available in the buffer. This interpretation is strengthenedby another observation reported by Fletcher. On the recall test, almost all correctresponses for the last cycle were verbatim correct, while for previous cycles asubstantial proportion of the correct responses were only gist correct 2paraphrases in the last cycle, 22 in the others.One might ask why items predicted to be held in the buffer did not lead to acorrect response with a probability close to one, rather than the more moderatevalues shown in Table 10. 1. For one, of course, the way the buffer contents were356selected in the Kintsch and van Dijk model can be considered no more than anapproximation. More significantly, as soon as we are dealing with average data,as we must in these experiments, precise predictions become impossible. Even ifwe had the perfect model of comprehension, and perfect knowledge about theknowledge and strategies available to an individual subject, we could still onlyapproximate average group performance.Fletchers work strongly suggests that shortterm memory in discourse comprehension does not merely maintain surface structures, but, in addition, also ineludes structurally important text propositions which are needed to establish acoherent text representation at the conceptual level. However, further research isrequired before this highly significant issue can be regarded as settled.10.4. RETRIEVAL FROM EPISODICTEXT MEMORYOne could summarize the previous section quite succinctly by saying thatshortterm memory in discourse processing is more or less the same as weknow it from the traditional memory literature. The chunks in discourse are, ofcourse, not the same as in a list of nonsense syllables, but the number ofchunks that can be held, the way they are affected by interference, etc., arecomparable. At first glance, this is clearly not so when we look at longtermmemory for discourse. Text memory is very much better than memory for listsof words or nonsense syllables. Whereas people are able to recall not muchmore than half a dozen words from a list of random words, they can recallmore than ten times as much after reading a page of coherent text. Thisobvious discrepancy might lead one to think that the memory theory derivedfrom listlearning experiments would be irrelevant as far as memory fordiscourse is concerned. An argument can be made to the contrary, howeverKintsch, 1982b Classical memory theory explains quite well why memoryfor discourse is so much better than memory for lists. The key lies inunderstanding the ways in which the text representations generated duringcomprehension function as efficient retrieval structures.The Kintsch and van Dijk 1978 model did not include an explicitaccount of retrieval processes. Whatever predictions it made about memorywere based on the plausible and widely shared hypothesis that what is processedmore extensively will be better recalled. Certain text propositions reside inshortterm memory longer than others, because they were selected to bemaintained for coherence establishment on the basis of their structuralprominence in the textbase. These propositions are recalled better in proportionto the amount of extra processing that they have received. In addition, somepropositions are processed further because they are macrorelevant and formthe basis from which the macrostructures is generated. This extra processingagain is reflected in an increased likelihood of recall. As we have just outlined inthe previous section, the present model shares these assumptions with theearlier one, except that it shifts the basis on which propositions are selected357for the shortterm buffer from a statistical approximation the leading edgestrategy of the 1978 model to the way in which frames and schemata organizea text, that is, to the knowledge structures that are being used to interpret it. Withthis modification, recall predictions can be derived from the present model inmuch the same way as in the 1978 model and in Miller and Kintsch 1981.However, memory is certainly not merely a matter of differential strength ofencoding. Interacting with these encoding processes, retrieval plays a dominantrole. A model for the retrieval process follows quite directly from the nature ofthe textbase itself as well as from the availability and structure of the situationmodel, which we will disregard for a moment here, Jalthough what we say aboutsearch in the textbase applies equally well to search in the situation model.Indeed, the nature of the textbase dictates, at least in general outlines, the form ofthe model. Given any text element, what can be retrieved from that starting pointare the elements directly connected to it. Retrieved elements then become thestarting points of new retrieval operations, so that after many such operationstwo elements in the text representation macropropositions, text propositions, oratomic propositions, even phrases if we want to study verbatim memory may beconnected by a long retrieval path with many intermediate nodes. If a textbase isfully coherent, this implies that starting anywhere in the textbase all elements canbe retrieved, in principle. However, if each retrieval operation is probabilistic,retrieval failures accumulate as the number of nodes that must be traversed alonga path increases. Exactly what the restrictions in this network retrieval are is notyet known. However, specific submodels embodying different sets of restrictionscan easily be devised and are subject to empirical text.We provide two illustrations. First, consider a free recall model that isentirely top down. That is, retrieval always starts at the top node and proceeds tolower nodes in the text representation. Let r be the probability that a retrievaloperation is successful. Then, a proposition P, which is related to the top nodevia k intervening macropropositions M and by no other path, will be retrievedwith probability rk. If the target proposition in question can also be reached via asecond path involving j intervening macropropositions, the retrieval probabilitywould be rk  rj  rk j, assuming path independence.This sketch can be filled in various ways. Let us assume, for instance, that theretrieval probability is r for connections between macropropositions MM andbetween macropropositions and text propositions MP, but that differentretrieval probabilities are involved for operations within the propositionalschema itself. For instance, it would seem highly plausible that atomicpropositions P that fill a slot in the schema are retrieved with a probability swhich is greater than the probability t of retrieving propositions that do not fill aslot but are merely added to the schema. for example, as modifiers. Furthermore,one might want to provide for the possibility that connections amongpropositions at the same level can also be used for retrieval, say with someprobability c. For example, if we consider the textbase fragment shown here, wemay obtain the following retrieval probabilities for the atomic propositions P1P3358MP1 P2P3pr retrieve Pt  rt  r2s  r3stpr retrieve P,  r 2s  r2tc  r4stcpr retrieve P,  r2t  r2sc  r4stcWe simply follow each path from the top node to the target proposition,multiplying the probabilities along the way. Paths probabilities are then addedand their intersection subtracted, assuming independence of path.If P1 P3 are successfully retrieved, with the probabilities just calculated, thentheir encoding strength determines the probability that they can be actually recalled.Specifically, if a proposition P has resided in shortterm memory during i processing cycles, its recall probability given successful retrieval is assumed to beprecalli  1  1  niwhere n is the probability of successfully encoding a microproposition during anyone processing cycle. In words, this formula means that recall occurs if at leastone of the chances an item had to be encoded was successful. Similarly, if theproposition P has participated in the construction of j  1 macropropositions, itsrecall strength will beprecallj  1   l  mj.Where m is the probability of successfully encoding a macroproposition during anyone processing cycle, Precalli and precallj are additive and independent. Exactly the same encoding assumptions were made in Kintsch and van Dijk 1978Thus, the 1978 model can be considered a limiting case of the present model wherer  s  c  1. Obviously, somewhat different assumptions about retrieval probabilities could be made with equal plausibility. We have no data set that is extensiveand detailed enough so that we could empirically explore which retrieval assumptions are most adequate.2 If, however, such data were available, alternativemodels like the one sketched could be tested against each other.For a second illustration, consider how cued recall would work in this modelAgain, we could construct various alternative models The textbase specifies the2The Miller and Kintsch 1980 data which were used to evaluate the 1978 model areuseless for present purposes. In order to apply the present model we would need to havesome idea about the kind , knowledge structures used by the subjects in understanding thetext. Various experimental possibilities suggest themselves, for example, pretraining, orhaving control subjects state their expectancies various points in the text.359connections among whatever elements we are concerned with, and we could explore plausible assumptions about how well different types of connectionssupport retrieval. Thus, to use our example again, if we know that P2 has beenrecalled, we could calculate the conditional probabilities that P1 and P3 wouldbe recalled with different sets of assumptions. If we had a suitable data set, suchanalyses might tell us quite a lot about retrieval processes in discourse.However, the main use of the model is not or at least not yet in this quantitative testing of specific hypotheses about retrieval processes in discourse, but inproviding us with a qualitative explanation for the most salient phenomenon indiscourse memoryits general excellence. If we look at the retrieval model that wehave arrived at here, it is no longer a puzzle that memory for text is so good. Thekind of structures that are being built during discourse comprehension are veryefficient retrieval systems. The material is organized into chunks which are constructed in correspondence with preexisting memory units, and the chunks arerichly interconnectedthe coherence requirement for both the micro andmacrostructure of the textbase assures that. Furthermore, the chunks areorganized hierarchically by the macrostructure, and related to, and henceaccessible from, similar chunks in the situation model.That is exactly the kind of system that memory theory leads us to expectwould be ideal for retrieval. It is not, of course, the kind of system that subjectsin the usual laboratory experiment construct. The subjects in traditional listlearning experiments are faced with an unfamiliar task, with unfamiliarmaterials, and are forced to devise encoding strategies on the spot often withouta corresponding situation model. All they can do is to rely on some general butweak encoding strategies, and the result is far from optimal for retrieval. Whenfaced with a simple text on some familiar topic, however, subjects are in a verydifferent situation. They can rely on rich background knowledge and they canbring to bear wellpracticedindeed, automatizedcomprehension strategies. Theresult is a textbase that is also an efficient retrieval system. These subjects areexpert comprehenders They have the right knowledge and the required strategieshighly available and well practiced. Like experts in other fields, their memoryreflects their expertise.Memory for text must, therefore, be compared with other types of expertmemory that have been studied in the laboratory, such as the memory feats ofexperienced telegraphers Bryan  Harter, 1899, the skills of experts in mentalcalculation Muller, l911 Hunter, 1962, the memory performance of chess playersde Groot, 1966 Chase  Simon, 1973, laboratory subjects who were trained inthe use of mnemonic devices Bower, 1972 Chase  Ericsson, 1981, and, aboveall, the ancient art of memory that was practiced by orators in classical antiquityYates, 1966. In light of such comparisons, text memory does not appear extraordinary at all. These mnemonists were experts in the use of their particular mnemonictechnique, but they were as poor as anyone else when they had to remembermaterial outside their field of expertise. Ordinary readers are experts in that sense.too They are good at remembering simple, familiar texts for which they have hadlots and lots of practice, but their memory fails them as soon as they are faced with a360text that they cannot understand properly, perhaps because they lack the properknowledge base, as in reading a technical discourse on an unfamiliar subject, orperhaps because they have not developed the right strategies, as when dealingwith unusual forms of discourse, such as in reading poetry.In order to follow up the parallel between text memory and expert memory inmore detail, we need to review some of the principal characteristics of expertmemory. A paper by Chase and Ericsson 1981 provides an excellent account ofthese characteristics. Chase and Ericsson have studied a subject in the laboratorywho learned to memorize sequences of over 80 random digits on a singlehearing. A memory span of more than 80 digits seems puzzling in view of thewellknown limitations of shortterm memory. The span is often considered ameasure of shortterm memory, and it would seem strange that shorttermmemory could be expanded in this way. Chase and Ericsson showed, however,that no miraculous expansion of shortterm memory was involved at all. Theshortterm memory capacity of their subject was completely normal andunchanged The chunks that he formed always consisted of 34 digits thephonemically coded rehearsal groups that he used never exceeded 5 or 6 ordererrors occurred as soon as more than 3 or 4 groups had to be tracked whicheventually forced him to invent a hierarchical organization schema to overcomethis limitation. Thus, the working capacity of Chase and Ericcsons subject wasno different than that of ordinary people who can remember no more than 7 or 9items on a digit span test.The feat was not one of shortterm memory at all, but consisted in theefficient use of longterm memory. It was mostly a matter of chunking andbuilding an efficient retrieval system. Chase and Ericsson discovered. The trickwas to use a chunking mechanism to bind stimulus traces to a hierarchicalsemantic structure. Chase and Ericssons subject invented a complex set ofstrategies to encode digit sequences. For this purpose, he used a knowledge basethat he was very familiar with and interested in His hobby was running, and heencoded the digit strings in terms of running times which then served as uniqueretrieval cues for the string. Much like the orator in Ciceros Rome, he depositedthe toberemembered numbers in particular places in his semantic structureabout running times. Classical orators were taught to remember speeches bysegmenting them into scenes, encoding each as a vivid pictorial image, anddepositing that image at a distinctive place along a wellmemorized route.Retrieval could then occur by mentally wandering along that route, picking upthe respective images along the way. This binding to a retrieval structure occursin working memory and is a form of chunking A rich, wellorganizedknowledge base about running times permits the immediate recognition ofrelevant patterns which are then bound to semantic features in the running timestructure e.g., 1mile time, near world record. The semantic features wereinterassociated and formed a retrieval structure that led the mnemonist from oneplace in memory to the next, making available at each location the digitsdeposited there.The prerequisites for such a retrieval structure are two. First, there must be arich knowledge base, such as the elaborate network of running times that Chase and361Ericssons subject had available. Second, all storage and retrieval operationsmust occur rapidly and effortlessly. Speed is crucial, because otherwise shortterm memory would quickly become overloaded. Therefore, a very large amountof practice is required before these operations become sufficiently automatized.There are several striking analogies with text memory. Text memory is verygood when there is an elaborate knowledge base to support it. Comprehensionstrategies are highly overlearned, they are fast and automatic. Text elements arebound to prior knowledge structures in that propositional schemata and are usedto chunk the text. Hierarchical macrostructures form efficient retrieval systems.At least, such is the case when simple, familiar texts are to be remembered.When texts are read for which an appropriate knowledge base does not exist,memory becomes poor just as when experts are given materials to processoutside their areas of competence. The texts we remember so well are oftensimple narratives for which we are very well prepared indeed, whereasdescriptive texts tend to be harder to remember Kintsch, Kozminsky, Streby,MeKoon,  Keenan, 1975 Graesaer, Hoffman,  Clark, 1980. When readersdo not know what they are reading because the authors have cleverly hiddenwhat they are talking about Bransford  Johnson, 1972, memory fails. Aparagraph about washing clothes written in such a way that the readers could notfigure out what the text was about and hence could not activate the appropriateknowledge was remembered just as badly as if subjects had been given a list ofrandom words 3.6 out of 14 idea units. A title which told the reader what thetext was about and therefore permitted the normal operation of comprehensionstrategies greatly improved memory for the same paragraph 8 idea unitsrecalled. The ununderstood paragraph was recalled so poorly because withoutrelevant knowledge structure and without an appropriate macroproposition asexpressed by a title no retrieval scheme could be established. Subjects stillunderstood the sentences at a local level and stored information in memory, butit was stored in an incoherent form and hence remained irretrievable Alba.Alexander, Harker,  Carniglia, 1981. A prerequisite for a coherent textrepresentation is the ability to construct a coherent situation model. Without that,memory for text is stored in disjoint bits and pieces which can no more beretrieved than a list of random words.Some preliminary experimental results confirming the interpretation of textmemory that we have offered here have been reported in Kintsch 1982b. Ifpropositions are used for chunking a discourse, they should behave like othermemorial units. Specifically, the effectiveness of a text fragment as a retrieval cueshould depend on chunk boundaries An element may be better able to retrievematerial from within the same chunk than material across a chunk boundary. This isa classical result which has been obtained in other situations where experts haveemployed a chunking strategy. Chase and Ericsson 1981, for instance, haveobserved this phenomenon in their investigation of the chunking that their memoryexpert employed for remembering strings of random numbers. They were able todetermine quite accurately what kinds of chunks were being used through protocolanalysis as well as other converging experimental results. Thus, they could select362small groups of digits in such a way that they did or did not coincide with achunk boundary. When one of these digit groups was presented, their subject hadto recall the digits that had followed it in the original string. This he was verywell able to do, as long as the cue and the digits following it belonged to thesame chunk. However, when the recall cue fell at a chunk boundary, so that thedigits to be recalled belonged to a different chunk, his performance droppedsignificantly. The chunks determined from the protocol analyses were apparentlyalso functioning as recall units.With discourse, we can also predict where the chunk boundaries are, depending on the propositional analysis of the text. Hence, following Chase andEricsson, we would expect a text fragment that forms the beginning of a chunk tobe a good retrieval cue for the remainder of the chunk, but a text fragment thatcoincides with a chunk boundary to be less effective in retrieving the succeedingtext across the chunk boundary.Five subjects listened to 250word sections from a nontechnical psychologicalresearch report. After each section, a phrase 619 words long from the passagejust read was repeated, and the subjects had to recall orally the wordsimmediately following that phrase in the original text. Recall was to be verbatimif possible. otherwise subjects were encouraged to say anything they couldremember. We shall give only two examples here to illustrate the qualitativenature of the results, pending a more extensive experiment.In the first example, the recall cue ended in the middle of a phrase. Tocomplete a propositional chunk the words immediately succeeding it arenecessary. Hence, they should be recalled wellCUE This discrepancy reflects not only ourCONTINUATION societys concentration of formal educational effort. . .Below are some illustrative responses from subjects in this studyRESPONSE a societys concentration of effort. . . .RESPONSE b societys focus on formal education. . . .RESPONSE c the shift in concentration of educational research. . . .Obviously, in all three of these cases the subjects response more or less completedthe propositional unit. Furthermore, the completions were largely verbatim. In athe response is entirely verbatim except for some omissions in b we have both anomission and a synonym only c is less precise, but even here two of the principalcontent words are reproduced verbatim. Such performance is quite remarkable,considering that the subjects had heard this text only once, and that after hearing thepassage used in the recall test subjects had listened to another 150 words of potentially interfering text. Clearly, subjects were not recalling from shortterm memory,by any reasonable definition of that term. It appears that the phrase used as a cuepartially matched a memory chunk at a very early level of analysis, making available the chunk as a whole at that level. Thus, not only the meaning but also most of363the wording of the continuation was retrieved. Whether the omissionsrepresented encoding or retrieval failures we cannot specify at this point.Now let us consider a recall cue that completes a chunk and therefore forcesthe subject to retrieve the next one. In this case, the problem is not merely toredintegrate a chunk on the basis of a partial match, but to partially match achunk in memory, and then retrieve via the textbase hierarchy the next chunkCUE As shown primarily by the work of Schaie,CONTINUATION a peak of intellectual performance occur.s later for current adult cohorts. . . .Some sample responses areRESPONSE d some abilities dont reach their peak until sometime later.RESPONSE e a peak occurs much later than previously believed and nodecline in intelligence.RESPONSE f after a long pause He was .finding results that differed frompreviously held ideas.These responses are quite different in character than ac Responses d ande are more of a paraphrase of the original phrase than a verbatim reproduction.The fact that these responses are less verbatim suggests that the process ofretrieval did not tap directly into the text representation as in the first example,but that the appropriate continuation was located indirectly via the superordinatemacroproposition that connects the two chunks to which the cue and thecontinuation belong. This process is less likely to retrieve the actual wording ofthe continuation, because the process of retrieval involves the propositionallevel, whereas in the previous case matches at both the linguistic and thepropositional level occurred. To reach the linguistic level after retrieving theappropriate microproposition requires one further fallible retrieval step.In f we are clearly dealing with a reconstruction The subject wasapparently unable to retrieve the successor proposition, but instead generated apartial reconstruction, probably via the macroproposition that dominated thisportion of the text, which was something like Old research shows Xin contrastSchaie shows Y. Response f was unusual What happened more frequentlywhen no successor proposition could be retrieved was that subjects gave noresponse at all. Indeed, in about onethird of all cases no responses were given tocues that straddled a chunk boundary, whereas no failures to respond occurredwhen a cue tapped directly into a propositional chunk.In spite of the preliminary nature of these data the conclusion seems warrantedthat cued text recall shows much the same chunking effects as cued digit recall ina memory expert. It will, of course, require a great deal more data to definitelyconfirm our claim, but what data we have so far is in good agreement with itDiscourse memoryat least under ideal conditions which insure adequate comprehensionis by its very nature a kind of expert memory. We need not postu364late new, as yet undiscovered, principles of memory to explain the fact that discourse memory is so much better than what we normally observe underlaboratory conditions in listlearning experiments. The principles of memory arethe same in both cases it is just that the process of comprehending a discoursecreates conditions that are very favorable for remembering. The wellstructured,multilevel, coherent textbase that is the result of the comprehension process quitenaturally functions as an efficient retrieval system so that just reading orlistening to a text assures a respectable level of recall. Of course, this does notmean that it would be impossible to achieve even better recall for discourse as aresult of special memory encoding procedures e.g., as described in Levin,1982. Under natural conditions, discourse recall is certainly not perfect,especially for subordinate details that are not macrorelevant, and variousmnemonic tricks can be used to improve it. For instance, it appears plausible thatthe use of imagery would greatly improve discourse memory without having anyeffect on comprehension per se, that is, on the construction of the textbaseexcept, perhaps, in cases where the imagery might help generate a goodsituation model. Comprehension and recall are correlated only up to a certainpoint Beyond that, memory improvement can still occur without affectingcomprehension.10.5. A PROCESSING MODEL FORUNDERSTANDING AND SOLVING WORDARITHMETIC PROBLEMSTo end chapter and book, we present a specific, explicit, complete processingmodel for a simple, welldefined comprehension problem. Our discussionsthroughout have been general, emphasizing the flexibility with which the manysubcomponents of discourse comprehension can interact in different situationsand for different purposes. As was pointed out in the beginning of this book,there is no unitary psychological process comprehension, and a general theoryof comprehension is more like a set of instructions for building specificcomprehension models in specific situations. At this point, we want to take ourinstructions and see how well they work when applied to a simple, but realisticand significant, comprehension problem how children, from kindergarten tothird grade, understand and solve word arithmetic problems. This work is byKintsch and Greeno 1982, and what we want to do here is to show in detailhow it was derived from the general principles of discourse comprehensionpresented in this book.Word arithmetic problems are ideally suited for this purpose. First of all, weare dealing with a wellspecified task The readers purpose, what is going to bedone with the information obtained from the text, is unambiguous. This greatlyrestricts the range of strategies that we need to consider. Furthermore, the strategiesto be used for understanding word arithmetic problems are very unusual ones Theyare so unusual that they must be taught in school though we shall see that by ouranalysis this is really not quite trueinstead of being taught explicitly, most of the365strategies necessary are left to be discovered by the student in the course of trialanderror problem solving. The very fact that such specialized comprehensionstrategies are involved is an advantage for the model because these strategies arevery distinct and easier to describe than widely used allpurpose strategies whichwe tend to take for granted. Finally, for all its simplicity, the problem is asignificant one. Doing word arithmetic problems is not an easy task for thesechildren, even though they know very well how to add and subtract Todetermine from a discourse what operations to perform on which numbers isoften quite confusing. The task of our model is to show exactly what steps areinvolved in this determination, and what the sources of confusion are.Table 10.2Types of Word Problems in Riley, Greeno, and Heller 1982CHANGEResult UnknownCOMBINECombine Value Unknown1.

Empirically, there is an excellent data base, showingwhich problems are difficult, when children can solve them, etc. Theoretically,there exist welldeveloped models for how the children solve these problems.However, these models do not start directly with the text, but with a problemrepresentation derived intuitively from the text. Certain operations are thenperformed on this problem presentation, leading to the solution of the problem inways that simulate the childrens solutions. Specifically, the model that we relyon here is that of Riley, Greeno, and Heller 1982. What we attempt to do is tofill in the missing step in this model that takes us from the text that the childrenread to the problem representation that their model is concerned with.The main problem types Riley et al. were concerned with are shown in Table10.2. Change 1 and Combine 1 are problems all firstgraders in their samplecould solve, whereas Change 3, Combine 2 and all the compare problems werequite difficult for the firstgraders. Even in the secondgrade children still had alot of trouble with Compare 3 for more detail see Table 10.17. Why do thethree problem types vary in difficulty Why do problems within a type differ10.5.1. The Propositional AnalysisThe first step in the model is to derive a propositional textbase from the verbalinput. This is a particularly simple task in the present case because all the problemsin Table l0. are constructed from just a few sentence frames. Indeed, there areonly 10 frames, which are listed in Table 10.3. The following conventions areobserved in Table 10.3 and in what follows X stands for a person either Joe orTom our examples. Y for an object always marbles here. N for a number, P for aproposition, and S for a set. Associated with each propositional frame is a meaningpostulate that indicates how the proposition is to be used in building the kind ofTable 10.3Propositiunal Frames and Their Meaning PostulatesFrames Meaning postulates1a Existentialsingular Joe, Tom jx tx Sx1b Existentialplural marbles my Sy2.

The schema for a set isshown in Table 10.4 A set has a label, namely, the proposition from which it hasbeen derived furthermore, it has four slots for a specification in terms ofownership, an object, a quantity, and a role. Note that the first two slots areentirely ad hoc in the sense that they are tailormade for the particular problem setRiley et al. worked with. Equally well, the entire problem set could have beenworded differently, for example, in terms of red and green apples, or marbles onthe floor and in the pocket, without any essential changes in the model. Theimportant slots of the set schema are quantity and rolethe first because it is thedefining feature of a set, the second because it specifies the relationship of the setwith other sets.Thus, if we have some X say, Joe, we can form a set with owner X andotherwise unspecified slots, which we denote by SX. Similarly, for Y. A HAVEproposition gives us more information, because it specifies both the owner andthe object, just as a Quantity proposition gives us the object and number. Themeaning Postulate for GIVE is quite a bit more complex, because we are nolonger dealing with a single set, but with a triplet of sets a start set, a transferset, and a result set. Specifically, the GIVE proposition corresponds to a set thathas the role of transfer set, the owner specified by the patient of the GIVEproposition, and the object also as specified by the GIVE proposition. Theproblem context then must provide suitable start and result sets If sets marked asstart and result sets exist with the same owner as the transfer set, then theTRANSFERIN schema applies. which is characterized by a restriction on thequantity slot of the result set, which must be equal to the sum of the quantitiesassociated with the start and transfer sets. If, on the other hand, the owner of thetransfer set is not the same as the owner of the start and result sets, theTRANSFEROUT schema is obtained, as indicated in Table 10.5.The roles of start, transfer, and result sets may be marked more or less explicitly in a problem. Sentence order is a sufficient cue Joe has three marbles.Tom gives him five more marbles. How many marbles does Joe have, but rolescan be marked more explicitly by specifying the temporal relationships amongsets with now, then, and in the beginning In the beginning Joe has threemarbles. Then Tom gives him five more marbles. How many marbles does Joehave nowThe MORETHAN schema is similar to the TRANSFER schema in that thecomplete schema involves three sets. If we say Joe has 5 more marbles thanTom, the elementary propositions involved are Joe jx1, Tom t x2, marbles y1,HAVE x11, HAVE x2y2 MORETHAN y1y2, and 5y1. The three sets in368Table 10.5The TRANSFERIn and TRANSFEROUT SchemataTRANSFERIN TRANSFEROUTSstart SstartObject Y Object YSpec HAVEXPATIENT,Y Spec HAVEXAGENT,YQuantity NA Quantity NARole start Role startStransferObject YSpec GIVEXAGENT, XPATIENT, YQuantity NBRole transferSresult SresultObject Y Object YSpec HAVEXPATIENT,Y Spec HAVEXAGENT,YQuantity NA  NB Quantity NA  NBRole result Role resultvolved consist of some unspecified number of marbles Joe owns the whole set,some unspecified number of marbles owned by Joe and matched by Toms marblesthe match set, and the 5 marbles that Joe owns in addition to the number matchedby Toms marbles the remainder set. Table 10.6 summarizes the MORETHANas well as the LESSTHAN relationships.What we are saying here is that understanding the propositions HAVE, GIVE,MORETHAN, etc., in the context of arithmetic word problems implies an abilityTable 10.6The MORETHAN and LESSTHAN Schematax1, has nr more marbles than x2 x1 has nr less marbles than x2Swhole SwholeObject y1 Object y1Spec owned by x1 Spec owned by x2Quantity nm  nr Quantity nm  nrRole whole Role wholeSmatchObject y2Spec owned by x1 and x2Quantity nmRole matchSremainder SremainderObject y3 Object y3Spec owned by x1 and not x2 Spec owned by x2 and not x1Quantity nr Quantity nrRole remainder Role remainder369to construct from them sometimes rather complex setschemata. The appropriateschematic superstructure of these word problems is in terms of sets. Once wehave the propositions of the textbase, we must know how to generate the rightkind of set relations to organize them into a coherent textbase.10.5.2. The Schematic SuperstructuresThe knowledge of the set schemata that we need comes with the text propositions in the form of associated meaning postulates, as we have just seen. Schematicstrategies use this knowledge, generating a superstructure for the organization of thetext propositions in terms of interrelated sets. Formally, strategies are modeled asproductions. Table 10.7 shows the four schematic strategies that are needed tounderstand the 14 word problems in Table 10.2. Each strategy has a name, aconditionthe occurrence of a particular type of proposition in the textbaseandan actionthe set it creates via the meaning postulate which is associated with theproposition which is the condition for the action. In each case the set that isgenerated is incomplete with respect to the schema, so that one or more requests foradditional information have to be set up e.g., for the number in the quantity slot, orfor information on the role of the set. MAKESET is thus triggered by a quantifierproposition in the context of a HAVE proposition and generates a set with ownerTable 10.7Schematic StrategiesName Condition Actionl.

Quantifier propositions in the contextof GIVE generate transfer sets as indicated, with requests for the quantity slotand suitable start and result sets. The context of a HAVE proposition with jointowners generates a superset with corresponding requests for the two subsets, ofcourse. A MORELESSTHAN proposition, in the context of a quantifier,generates a remainder set, with associated requests for the missing elements ofthe schema.Note that the schematic strategies presuppose two conditions First, theappropriate knowledge schema must be availableif the child does not knowwhat GIVE or MORETHAN means, that is, does not have associated with it theright meaning postulate, then these problems cannot be solved. Second, however,this knowledge must be active and in the form of a production The reader mustknow precisely which cues in the text are supposed to trigger particularknowledge structures. It is not enough to have the knowledge, it must also beused at the right moment.10.5.3. MacrooperatorsFor the word problems in Table 10.2 macrooperators play a relatively minorand fairly subtle role. The texts are short, and written in such a way that theirmicrostructure and macrostructure is essentially identical. There is no redundantor irrelevant material to delete, there are no occasions to use the constructionoperator. One could easily rewrite these problems, however, embedding theminto a longer text and introducing both problemirrelevant information andredundancies. Word problems could in this way be made much more difficult. Inthat case. the child would need to learn strategies for the use of the deletionoperator, for example, to delete all propositions that do not contribute directly tothe establishment of the schematic superstructure. In other words, it would benecessary to acquire taskspecific macrostrategies, which may run counter tonormal reading strategies. One would suppose that embedding an arithmeticproblem into an interesting story would interfere with the operation of these taskspecific macrooperators The child would have to learn to disregard what isnormally important in a story goals, conflicts, interesting complications, and tolook at it merely in terms of sets and their associated quantities. For somesimilar kinds of interference effects, see Hidi, Baird,  Hildyard, 1982.However, even in the prepared problem set we are dealing with here, themacrooperation of generalization has still an important though subtle role to fulfill.What needs to be done is to strip the names and objects used in these problems of alltheir individuality and treat them merely as labels for sets. Whether it is my enemyJoe who has the marbles or my dear friend Lucy does not matter, and if instead ofmarbles Lucy has the cutest little kittens it still does not matter. This abstraction isof crucial importance in learning to do arithmetic or other types of formal reasoning, and cannot always be taken for granted, especially when the outcome of thearithmetic operation is of emotional importance to the problem solver. Thus, themacrooperation of generalization plays a subtle but significant role even in degen371erate, prepared school problems of the kind we are dealing with here. In arealistic, real life context, macrostrategies would assume an even more importantrole.10.5.4. The Problem Representation andArithmetic OperationsThe schematic operators construct the microstructure of the text, which in ourspecial case is also its macrostructure, except for the kind of abstractionmentioned above. The textbase for these word problems consists, therefore, of anumber of set units which contain in their slots the propositions of the text, andwhich are interrelated with each other, forming higher order units, such as theTRANSFERIN schema, or the MORETHAN schema. Thus, we obtain a hierarchicalstructure with various complex schemata at the top, set schemata at the next levelcorresponding to the propositional schemata of Chapter 4, and atomicpropositions in the slots of these set schemata. This organization is, of course,specifically generated for the purpose of doing arithmetic operations, but inprinciple it is no different from the organization of a narrative, for instance. In thatcase, too, we have atomic propositions bundled together via macropropositionsin accordance with a narrative schema.The reason for constructing such a singleminded textbase for word problemsis that the situation model that has to be generated is a set structure. The situationmodel is simply the problem representation in terms of setsmuch as it wasenvisaged by Riley et al. Corresponding to the textbase unit Set A, for instance,we have a conceptual representation Set A that is nontextual. Set A is a textstructure that organizes certain atomic propositions in a schematic way Set A isan abstract structure, specifying a certain set, with a certain number of elements,and a certain role in the larger schema.Arithmetic operators apply to this problem representation. Once again, theseoperators are productions, the condition for which is a certain constellation ofsets. For instance, if a problem representation consists of a superset and a subsetwith known quantities, and another subset with an unknown quantity, theproduction SUBTRACT is triggered, which computes the unknown quantity anduses it to answer the problem. Table 10.8 shows various other constellationswhich give rise to arithmetic operations, exactly as in Riley et a. Note that inaddition to the true arithmetic operations ADD and SUBTRACT, there arevarious counting operations which children can and do use in solving theseproblems. Young children use counting to solve several problem types beforethey have a concept of set, which is a prerequisite for true addition andsubtraction. The first four change problems and the first combine problem can besolved by counting operations, whereas the remaining problems presuppose truearithmetic operations. Riley et al. discuss these matters in appropriate detail.Note that the situation modelthat is, the problem representationin partsimply mirrors the textbase. The textbase has its slots filled with propositions, while372Table 10.8Calculational Inferencesa Counting operationsStart Transferout Transferin ResultCOUNTON X X COUNTBACK X X COUNTBACK X  XCOUNTON X  XCONVERT  X XCONVERT  X Xb Arithmetic operationsSuperset Subset A Subset BADD  X XSUBTRACT X X at the level of the problem representation we have merely a label, a roledesignation, and a number. However, quite frequently the textbase unit may beincomplete. for example, because there is no proposition to till one of the slots ofthe schema so that the quantity or role slots remain unspecified. Nevertheless,these slots must be tilled in the corresponding problem representation Inferencesmust be used to decide what the missing values for the role and quantity slot are.Thus, the problem representation is t double of the propositional textbase, but itcontains additional, inferred information that is not part of the textbase properwhich is of course one of the reasons which we gave in Section 10. 1 forintroducing a situation model in the first place.10.5.5. Examples of the Operation ofSchematic StrategiesIn Tables 10.910. 16 examples are presented of how this model works forthe problem set of Table 10.2.Change problems. Consider Change 1 Table 10.9. Joe has three marblescontains four atomic propositions Joe  x1 and marbles  y1 HAVE x1,y1, and3y. The notation for three marbles we have chosen here has the virtue of simplicity and is quite adequate for present purposes though of course not for thepurposes of a logician or semanticist. In the second sentence, Tom is introduced byanother atomic proposition, and so is the second marbles. However, we do not needa new atomic proposition for him   Joe, because we are dealing with a definitedescription that refers to an earlier entity, unlike five more marbles, which doesnot refer to the earlier marbles. How many marbles in the final sentence is alsotreated as an indefinite description, requiring a separate atomic proposition.33Note that the convention used in Kintsch  1974 of omitting explicit existential propositionswould produce considerable confusion here because we need to be specific about which marbleswe are talking about.373Table 10.9Change lACTION SHORTTERM MEMORYP1 jx1 .S, Object Y MP2 My,  SpecP3 HAVEx,y, Pa 3P4 3,, Role startP5 THENP3 PH S Object P,MP6 tr SpecP7 My2 Py5P8 GIVExz x, y Role P5 transferP9 5vi REQUEST S,,iS,muP10 MpHOWMANYv, S3ISpcc Object PMP11 P, JP12 HAVEx, y, Quantity PP13 NOWP,z LRole P, I resultCALCULATE CountonWe assume propositions to be constructed on line, as soon as all thenecessary linguistic information is available. Whenever a proposition is obtainedthat is a condition for one of the schematic strategies, that strategy is triggered,and all the propositions from the current sentence are used to fill the slots of theset that resulted from that strategy. Thus, in Table 10.9, P3 and P4 is thecondition for a MAKESET operation and results in Set S1, which has P1 and P3as its specification, P2 in the object slot, and P4 in the quantity slot. Note thatthere is no proposition to fill the role slot of S1. The slots of the set schema havetwo entries The first is a text proposition, and derived from it indicated by anarrow is the corresponding element of the problem representation M formarbles, J for Joe, the number 3.In the next sentence, P9 in the context of the GIVE proposition P8 triggers aMAKETRANSFERSET, with the result of S2. The transfer set S2 carries with itautomatically requests for a start and result set. Set 1 can be identified as the startset on the basis of two cues initial position, and the then of the second sentenceP5. At this point the role of start set can be assigned to S1but only to theproblem representation of S1, not to the textbase itself. In order to indicate thatthe start role of S I was inferred later and not when S1 was first set up, we haveenclosed start within slashes in S1.P11 and P12 are the condition for another MAKESET, generating S3. Although the MAKEset operation by itself does not fill the role slot of S3, thepresence of a request for a result set as well as specific linguistic cues sentenceorder and now indicate that S3 must be a result set. Note that in the quantity slot of374Table 10.10Change 3ACTIONF,P,ick1 S, Object P MMly , r Role Spec P,PJP, HAVEci ci I Quantity Pa3Pa f,  start,P THENPz PH S P7 M rObjectI, t.c Ill,P, Mr Spec PPH JPn GIVE.r c, y Pi,R, SOMEW, Quantity P,P 15 , ,Role P transferRIQIGS1 S.5,ouF,n NOWP, Obj Pm M Fi i Mfs I ,SHORTCIRM MGMORlS, , L5 ,.

Again, we have only one Tom andone Joe, but several different marbles. The schematic operators are also used inmuch the same way as in Change 1, but note that the quantity slot in S2 is filledon the textbase side by P9SOMEMARBLES, but is empty in the problemrepresentation. The fourth sentence of the problem triggers another MAKETRANSFERSET, but the set that is created is the same as S2 hence P14P16are subsumed under S2 thereby assigning a calculation goal to the problemrepresentation of S2. Change 5 Table 10.11 proceeds analogously.Combine problems Tables 10.1210.13. A different operator is triggered inthe combine problems. In Combine 1, a quantifier proposition in the context of aHAVE proposition with joint owner P10P11 is the condition for a MAKESU375Table 10.11Change 5ACTION SHORTFERMMEMORlP, jr,  FS Object P, NtF Mc1 P14F HAVE.r, y, Spec .IF SOMEc1  P16Quantity P4PiRule P,, startPTHENF, Ph Object P, M S,P fc Spec P,,PK JP, Mc Quantity P, iP, GIVE.r.r, c Role Ps R 5 Nz REQUEST S,S,ItPioNOWP, S, Object P11 MP Mc, Spec P,  J 5,P, HAVIr, c3 Quantity P, K REQIESTS,.Piz8z Role P, resultP,4Mr4 MATCH S, on P16 P17P HOWMANY h,4 FSiF HAVEx, yzP, PASTP16CALCULATE ConcertsubtractPERSET. With it come two requests for subsets, one for each of the jointowners. The previously established sets S1 and S2 satisfy these requests and therole of subset is assigned to them in the problem representation, which sets thecondition for the arithmetic operator ADD.In Combine 2 a superset is established first, carrying with it a request forappropriate subsets. Sets S2 and S3 can be identified as such merely on the basisof the specification slot. However, a slight rewording of the second and thirdsentence in Combine 2 could provide a more direct linguistic cue to their subsetroles Joe has three of these would be the condition for a special subset operator.which would directly establish the subset roles of S2 and S3 and therebyobviate the necessity for an inference. Indeed, Riley et al. report that such slightrewording makes the problem somewhat easier to solvepresumably because itsupplied the children with an extralinguistic cue that was missing in the originalversion.Compare problems. In Compare 1 Table 10. 14, two roleless sets are established first.

Note that what isinferered is entirely a conceptual structure belonging to the problemrepresentationnot a set of propositions in the textbase. The final two problemsTables 10.15l0.16 introduce no new devices, though the by now familiaroperators are combined here in novel ways. In all of the compare problems, thefinal outcome is a MORETHAN pattern, with a whole set, a match set, and aremainder set, and a calculation goal assigned to one of these. We can eitherassume that these patterns are by themselves conditions for the appropriatearithmetic operations, or that the whole matchremainder pattern gets convertedinto a supersubsub pattern, the usual condition for addition and subtraction.What these examples demonstrate is, first of all, that the model works as weclaimed it did. One can indeed specify comprehension strategies at various levelsthat result in the construction of a text representation and a situation model that aresuitable for the problemsolving task. As Kintsch and Greeno 1982 pointed out intheir original report on this work, such a demonstration has some interesting implications. It tells us, for instance, why some problems are harder to solve thanothers. Different problem types require different knowledge structures and differentstrategies or the application of that knowledge. Change problems, for instance,require that the child know about the TRANSFER schema, which is simple andconcrete and, apparently, is quite within the grasp of even the kindergarten children. The SUPERSET schema and especially the MORETHAN schema are muchless available and might require some special training, both at the level of concrete378Table 10.15Compare 3ACTIONPi 0 i SiObject P MP M6 1 Spec P, P, JP, HAVE.r, yi Quantity Pt  3P, 3ry Role matchP t.r S Object P,,  NIWy Spec PP7i fP HAVE s s Quantity PK 5PH 5v Role Pa rernainderP MOREy, N, REQUEST.

As we have mentioned before, skill in solvingthese problems is not merely a matter of having the right knowledge. The modelalso specifies what sort of strategies conditionaction pairs the skilled problemsolver needs in order to apply this knowledge.However, the examples discussed so far do not yet do justice to the full powerof the model. There is an obvious problem If problem difficulty were merely amatter of the right knowledge and the right strategies, then all the problems within agiven problem type should be equally difficult, because exactly the same schemataand strategies are used for all change problems, for all compare problems, and soon. The problems within each type differ only in the order in which the informationis presented, but nevertheless this is a major factor in problem difficulty As Table10.17 shows, differences in problem difficulty exist not only between types, butalso within types, with the most difficult version within a type being from two tofour times as hard as the easiest version for the firstgraders. Some of these intratypedifferences are due to the fact that in some problem versions counting operationscan be used, whereas true arithmetic operations are needed for others, as has beenargued by Riley et al. However, even if we take this undoubtedly important factorinto account, differences in problem difficulty remain which the model so far hasnot accounted for. The reason for this is that we have not yet considered theconstraints that are imposed on the comprehension and solution process by thecapacity limits of the human informationprocessing system.38010.5.6. RealTime Processing ConstraintsOf primary concern at this point are the shortterm memory constraints discussed in Section 10.3. However, we need here specific assumptions instead ofthe general discussion presented there. We assume that shortterm memory canhold a single chunk, but that certain properties of that chunk are related tomemory load. A chunk is defined as an element at any of the levels of analysisconsidered here It may be a solitary atomic proposition, or a set of suchpropositions bundled together by a set schema, or even several set schemataforming a higher order structure, such as a TRANSFER or SUPERSET schema.Thus, if Set A is held in shortterm memory and a new, unrelated Set B isformed, Set A will be displaced from shortterm memory by Set B, so thatretrieving it at a later time would require a reinstatement operation. On the otherhand, if Set A is held in shortterm memory and a Set B is generated such thatboth A and B are part of some larger unit say a TRANSFER schema, and bothA and B can be jointly retained in shortterm memory. Thus, at the end ofcompare problems, the whole set structure involving three sets is available inshortterm memory, so that it can cue one of the arithmetic operators. One of theproperties of shortterm memory is therefore chunk sire, measured in terms ofcomponent sets.Another factor determining memory load is the number of active requests formissing information that have to be carried along. These are requests for sets tofill the roles in some higher order schema as when a GIVE propositionestablishes a transfer set but no suitable start or result set is available in the shortterm buffer. The number of such requests that have to be kept active duringprocessing provides another measure of shortterm memory load.Let us now consider once more the examples we have discussed. keepingtrack of how the processing occurs in real time subject to the constraints justmentioned. The righthand columns of Tables 10.910.11 summarize whathappens with the change problems. For Change 1, the first sentence leads to theformation of S1 with owner J and quantity 3. As the second sentence is read, S1J,3 is held in the buffer, while S2 is formed. As S2 is a transfer set, it occasionsrequests for start and result sets. The request for the start set can be satisfiedimmediately indicated in the table by double slashes after Sstart, as S1 is stillavailable in the buffer and is a suitable candidate. The request for a result set, onthe other hand, must he carried along in an active state. Hence, for the thirdprocessing cycle, the shortterm buffer contains the partial TRANSFERschema construction S1S2, plus an active request. When S3 is formed duringthat cycle, that request can be satisfied. For the final processing cycle we have inthe buffer a complete TRANSFER schema. filled with the information from thetext, which triggers the calculation operator COUNTON, providing the solutionto the problem.Change 3 and 5 proceed similarly, except that in each case there is afourth sentence which does not lead to the formation of a new set but rather to amatch to an old one.381In Combine l Table 10.12 S2 displaces S1 from the buffer, because at thatpoint in the process S1 and S2 are separate chunks We do not yet know whattheir relationship is. Hence, when a superset is formed during the thirdprocessing cycle and two requests for subsets are activated, only S2 is stillavailable in the buffer to satisfy one of these requests. To retrieve S1 requires areinstatement search of episodic text memory. The condition for this searchwould be that there is no more text input, but still a leftover, active request.Note that in assigning the roles of subset to S1 and S2 inferences are madeThere are no direct cues in the text that trigger this role assignment.Combine 2 Table 10. 13 requires the same inferences, but the problem isformulated so that there is no need for a reinstatement search. The shorttermmemory load is, however, substantially greater in this case.The compare problems Tables 10.l410. 16 are processed similarly. Consider the processing of Compare 5. A set S1 of 8 marbles belonging to Joe iscreated. Next, MORE THAN creates a remainder set, and S1 is recognized asthe corresponding whole set a flag goes up for the missing match set. For thefirst time m these problems we encounter a case where not all propositions canbe assigned to slots in the schema P9P11 are connected to P8, but there is noquantifier proposition which would trigger a MAKESET operation, creating aset of Toms marbles and a home for P9P11. Thus, these dangling propositionsmust be carried along in shortterm memory until a place can be found for themin the text structure. This occurs in Cycle 3, where they can be assigned to thematch set. The whole pattern is completed, the MORETHAN schema isconverted into a SUPERSET schema, the arithmetic operation SUBTRACT istriggered, and the problem is solved.Table 10. 17 summarizes some statistics relevant to problem difficulty in thisproblem set the kind of knowledge structures required, the number of inferencesthat have to be made, the number of reinstatement searches required, the shorttermmemory load in terms of the average chunk size, the number of requests and thenumber of unassigned propositions that have to be carried along in the buffer duringcomprehension. Some empirical indications as to problem difficulty are also provided from the data presented in Riley et al. Quite obviously and not surprisingly,the nature of the knowledge structure makes a great deal of difference. As thenumber of inferences is strongly correlated with knowledge structures, it is hard totell how much they contribute to problem difficulty. However, the evidence mentioned earlier that combine problems can be made easier by rewording them so thatset roles do not have to be inferred but are indicated by linguistic cues suggests thatinferences do matter as they did with completely different texts in Miller Kintsch, 1981. Reinstatements, however, do not appear to add to problem difficulty at all in Table 10.17. This observation contrasts strongly with the Miller andKintsch results just alluded to, where reinstatements proved to be a major source ofproblem difficulty. The reason for this discrepancy is easy to see The presentproblems were so short that longterm memory searches were trivial. Even withouta proper retrieval cue, the reader could retrieve the first sentence on the basis of382temporal cues. With the considerably longer texts of Miller and Kintsch,temporal cues become less useful and reinstatement becomes a resourcedemanding operation.The most important source of problem difficulty within each problem typewas clearly shortterm memory load according to Table 10.17. Even the secondgraders had some trouble with those versions of change and combine problemsthat made large demands on shortterm memory, in spite of the fact that theirbehavior on other versions of these problems clearly showed that they werefamiliar with the requisite knowledge structures and strategies. For the moredifficult compare problems, this probably was not the case, but once againwhether or not a problem was expressed in a way that was friendly with respectto shortterm storage requirements made a substantial difference. The onlyproblem with our analysis is that according to the model the memory load isidentical for Change 3 and Change 5, whereas there exists a clear differencebehaviorally. This discrepancy probably reflects an unwarranted assumption wehave made We assumed that an indefinite quantifier propositionSOMErfunctions as a condition for a MAKESET operation. It is plausible, however,that children might not treat sonic marbles in quite the same way as fivemarbles, and fail to construct a corresponding set. To the extent that this mighthave happened, the memory load for Change 3 and especially Change 5would increase substantially, because unattached propositions would have to becarried along over much as three cycles in Change 5. Thus, we suggest that thesurprising difficulty children have with Change 5 is due to confusion overindefinite quantifiers.According to this analysis, there are, therefore, two reasons why failures tosolve word arithmetic problems occur because of a lack of knowledge, andbecause of lack of resources. Important research questions arise at this pointconcerning the interaction between shortterm memory capacity and the degreeto which schema use is automatized, and hence would make fewer resourcedemands, leaving the reader free to deal with problems of shortterm memory.Without sufficient automatization, one would expect that the knowledge usestrategics would divert too many resources from the shortterm memorymaintenance required by these problems, thereby introducing a source of errorand problem difficulty. Although we cannot explore these contingencies here, amodel like the present one at least sets the stage for the study of such questions.This brief description of the model for understanding word arithmetic problemsmust suffice here. More detail is provided in the original publication. We would liketo point out, however, that some of the properties of this model pertain to thebehavior to be modeled, and are not features of our general theory. The presentmodel is extremely bottom up, data driven whatever planning and goal setting isdone happens right away when the decision is made to deal with a certain problemset and certain operators. Even slight generalizations as envisaged by Kintsch Greeno, 1982 would introduce more topdown processing, a deeper semantic analysis of the problem situation than was necessary here, and more complex, flexiblestrategies. Here we modeled a datadriven process the techniques we used could383also be applied to modeling more complex understanding processes thanchildrens problem solving.It would, of course, be silly to claim that the model we have sketched here isthe correct one, or the only one possible. All we have done here is to work out indetail one possible modelone that follows straightforwardly from the generaltheory of comprehension presented in this book and that fits in well with theproblemsolving model of Riley et al. 1982. We have just seen that this modelpredicts rather well problem difficulty in the set of problems considered here,and hence has at least some empirical support. We have also seen that this modelraises some interesting questions, both research questions and questionsconcerning teaching methods and educational practice Kintsch  Greeno, 1982,discuss some of these questions more fully. But none of this means that we havefound the right or the ultimate solution. Obviously, there are alternativeformulations, involving possibly very different assumptions both about discoursecomprehension and problem solving. For the sake of scientific progress suchmodels must eventually be developed and tested against each other. What wehave done here is merely to take a first step to work out in detail u complete andprincipled model of how children understand and solve word arithmeticproblems. Our main point was to show that the general theory presented herepermits such an explicit formulation. Eventually. when alternative theories andalternative models have reached comparable stages of development, the task ofdeciding among them can be undertaken.10.6. EPILOGUEIn concluding this book we want to reflect briefly on the nature of the enterprise that we have been engaged in. What is the use of developing a generaltheory of comprehension strategies It belongs neither to linguistics norpsychology, is neither fish nor fowl. From the very beginning it was clear thatthe theory could not cover all aspects of comprehension processes, and hencemust remain partial. though we have tried to be comprehensive within theboundary conditions we set for ourselves. It was also clear that despite of ourefforts, many details of the theory must remain vague. Indeed, what we havepresented is not so much a theory as a framework for a theory. We have tried todefine the principles needed to construct a theory, given a particularcomprehension situation. There can be no theory of comprehension that is atonce specified and general because there is no single, unitary processcomprehension. Every time we look at discourse comprehension, it is a little bitdifferent. What one needs to deal with this situation is a framework for studyingit, a set of principles and analyses that can he applied to concrete cases. Theapplication will always work out a little differently in each case, but because thesame building blocks are used every time, we can go beyond ad hoc, arbitraryminiature models, which might be very simple and even elegant, but whichmerely serve to deceive us about the real complexity of comprehensionprocesses.Not only do new situations require new and different models, but different384theoretical purposes also lead to the construction and use of different models.Thus, if our purpose is to study how knowledge is used in solving wordarithmetic problems, a different level of analysis is required than when ourpurpose is merely to predict average recall performance for subjects who read astory. The latter goal is well served by the Kintsch and van Dijk 1978 versionof our model, which is well suited for that particular purpose, though entirelyinadequate for some other purposes.Similar things can be said about notation, for example, the kind of propositional representations we have employed here There is no need to make it morecomplex than required. If one needs a rough analysis of a text into idea units,quite a superficial notation will suffice the more subtle the goals of the analysis,the more sophisticated the notation must become. Within the general frameworkthere are many possible approaches. It is neither necessary nor desirable to dealwith the problem always at its full level of complexity. As long as we have ageneral framework we can know where and what we have been simplifying. andcan judge whether these simplifications were appropriate.How does one evaluate the adequacy of the general framework for understanding language comprehension that we have developed here Although some global,informal evaluations with respect to what is known about discourse comprehensionin the literature and from our own intuitions are certainly possible, formal, preciseevaluations are notby its very nature, the theory has to be too flexible, too generalfor that. Thus, the main criterion of success, we suggest, becomes our ability toderive fruitful situation and taskspecific models from the general theory, as well asexperimental tests of various principles and implications of these models. Thus, themethods of experimental psychology can provide an empirical evaluation, albeit ina somewhat unconventional way. The theory as a whole is too general to be subjectto direct experimental tests, but the accumulation of observational and experimentalevidence relative to certain of its points will eventually verify or disconfirm thetheory. The experiments reported here, are no more than a beginning. There is verymuch more that can and should be done, compared with the modest results we haveachieved so far. Basically, what we have consists of a series of demonstrations thatprocesses that should occur in a certain way according to the theory can indeed heobserved under appropriate, carefully controlled laboratory conditions. Thus, inChapter 5 we showed that discourse effects, to which we have assigned greatimportance in the discussion of local coherence establishment, can indeed exercise adominant influence on pronoun identification. In Chapter 6 Experiment 4 wearranged conditions in such a way that two macrostrategiesinvolving interest andlevel of descriptions as cues for in macrorelevancecan be seen to operate. In Chapter7 we showed that the presence of a clearcut rhetorical structure may facilitate theformation of macrostructures. All these cases are basically demonstration experiments We arrange experimental conditionsthe nature of the text as well as thetasks the subjects performin such a way that certain theoretically interestingbehaviors can be observed in relatively clear form such experiments are demonstrations of the control we are able to exercise over the subjecttext interaction, and385thereby, by implication, of our knowledge about comprehension processes. Otherexperiments reported here are, however, of a quite different nature They are notso much tests of the theory, but are plainly and frankly exploratory. Often thetheory gives us no more than an indication where and how to look for potentiallyinteresting phenomena. Thus, in Chapter 4 we reported some exploratory workon strategies for proposition construction. We did not know enough to makeprecise predictions, but we did know enough to make some observations that gobeyond common sense and may be the starting point for a more systematicmapping out of this potentially important field of investigation. Similarly, the useof the priming methodology to investigate the realtime course of macrostructureformation Chapter 6 was exploratory, yielding some important insights andopening up a promising territory. Much the same could be said about the study ofglobal biases in knowledge use Chapter 8. This use of experiments as tools fortheoryguided exploration, complementing the more traditional function ofexperiments as tests for theoretical predictions, must become more and morewidespread and more important as theories in cognitive science become morecomplex and less directly testable.In the immediate future, we see several ways in which this work can developfurther. One was implicit in the preceding paragraphs Now that we have whatwe think is an acceptable framework for discourse comprehension, research onthe details of comprehension processes becomes more feasible, and much moreof it is needed to deepen out understanding of these processes. Such work mustbe both theoretical, involving the construction of specific, explicit models forwelldefined situations, and experimental, as suggested above. The second lineof development involves expansion beyond the constricting boundaries that wehave respected here, to a more detailed consideration or parsing processes, forinstance, or to the burgeoning field of hot cognition opinions, attitudes thathas fascinated us so much here. Finally, a third line of development will be theconstruction of an explicit cognitive bridge toward the communicative contextthe situational and sociocultural context of discourse processing.ReferencesAbbot, V.,  Black, J.

P2, P3P   P4, P5,ZPr,Pe, P7P P8, P9pr Plo, Pi rPI, Piv P13states we read that p, in the alternative possible worlds has been realized as a consequence of the actions. The finalstates, however, are not only characterized by pi, but also by other properties p pt, etc.. It may be that the agent doesnot want these to be realized as consequences of the action. In that case the alternatives are reduced to those paths thatlead to pt plus those other properties that are at least not inconsistent with the wishes of the agent. If one of these otherproperties is also wanted, then the path that leads to a state that leads to both will be chosen. In that case we speak of anoptimal goal, that is a goal that contains at least pi plus a maximum of further properties p,, p,, . . . that are also wanted.However, going from the initial to the final state along different paths will seldom be equally easy. That is, someactions will take more time, effort, money, or will involve unwanted intermediary states. The sum of these will, as ineconomic decision theory, be called the cost of each action. A rational agent will in such cases try to reach an optimalgoal along the lowest cost path, that is, in the easiest way. Often things will not be so clearcut Optimal goals may bereached only via high cost paths. The agent will then have to decide, by comparing costs and goals a meansendanalysis, what his or her preferences are easy actions with minimal goal attainment i.e., at least p,, or maximizingthe goal with further cost.Finally, it should be borne in mind that goals are merely consequences of actions and hence beyond the control ofthe agent. In other words, they will obtain with only some degree of probability, depending on other circumstances ofeach state in the action sequence. Thus, some action sequences will almost certainly lead to p,, whereas others have ahigh chance of failing not in Figure 3. 1, where each path leads to p,. In many cases, these intermediary circumstancesmay not be known to the agent, so that each path choice will depend on the knowledge and beliefs of the agent aboutthe possible outcomes, consequences, and circumstances of each action. Hence, some paths may be riskier, that is, havelower accumulated probabilities of leading to the desired goal. Again, the agent will then have to choose betweenrelatively risky or certain paths, as compared to relatively optimal final goals.3.2.2. StrategiesAgainst this background of notions from the theory of action we may now define the notion of strategy. We haveseen that strategies involve actions, goals, and some notion of optimaliy Intuitively, a strategy is the idea of utilgCllt aboutI III NOTION OF STRATEGY I i, hest way to act in order to reach a foal i,I II I atrgy to be a cognitive representation of ,om.
