These QoS constraints pose a variety of challenges, especially when the network cross-traffic is unknown and time-varying. In this work, we propose an application layer congestion control protocol for telehaptic applications operating over shared networks, termed as dynamic packetization module (DPM). DPM is a lossless, network-aware protocol which tunes the telehaptic packetization rate based on the level of congestion in the network. To monitor the network congestion, we devise a novel network feedback module, which communicates the end-to-end delays encountered by the telehaptic packets to the respective transmitters, with negligible overhead. Via extensive simulations, we show that DPM meets the QoS requirements of telehaptic applications over a wide range of network cross-traffic conditions. We also report the qualitative results of a real-time telepottery experiment with several human subjects, which reveal that DPM preserves the quality of telehaptic activity even under heavily congested network scenarios. Finally, we compare the performance of DPM with existing telehaptic communication protocols, and conclude that DPM outperforms other techniques. A Temporal Order Modeling Approach to Human Action Recognition from Multimodal Sensor Data Jun Ye (University of Central Florida); Hao Hu (University of Central Florida); Guo-Jun Qi (University of Central Florida); Kien A. Hua (University of Central Florida) From wearable devices to depth cameras, researchers are exploiting various multimodal data to recognize human actions for applications such as video gaming, education, healthcare, etc. While there have been many successful techniques in the literature, most of the current approaches have focused on statistical or local spatio-temporal features and do not explicitly explore the temporal dynamics of the sensor streams. However, human action streams contain rich temporal structure information that can characterize the unique underlying patterns of different action types. From this perspective, we propose a novel temporal order modeling approach to human action recognition. Specifically, we explore subspace projections to extract the latent temporal patterns of the actions. The temporal order between these patterns are compared and the index of the pattern that appears first is encoded. This process is iterated over multiple times and produces a compact feature vector representing the temporal dynamics of the sensor data. Human action recognition can then be efficiently solved by the nearest neighbor search based on the Hamming distance between these compact feature vectors. We further introduce a sequential optimization algorithm to learn the optimized projections that preserve the pairwise label similarity of the original sensor data. The performances are evaluated on two public human action datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique in both accuracy and efficiency. Multi Channel-Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis for Cross-View Person Re-Identification Giuseppe Lisanti (Universita degli Studi di Firenze); Svebor Karaman (Columbia University); Iacopo Masi (University of Southern California) In this paper we introduce a method to overcome one of the main challenges of person re-identification in multi-camera networks, namely cross-view appearance changes. The proposed solution addresses the extreme variability of person appearance in different camera views by exploiting multiple feature representations. For each feature, Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (KCCA) with different kernels is employed to learn several projection spaces in which the appearance correlation between samples of the same person observed from different cameras is maximized. An iterative logistic regression is finally used to select and weigh the contributions of each projection and perform the matching between the two views. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed solution obtains comparable performance on VIPeR and PRID 450s datasets and improves on PRID and CUHK01 datasets with respect to the state of the art. Machine Learning Based Parametric Audiovisual Quality Prediction Models for Realtime Communications Edip Demirbilek (Institut national de la recherche scientifique Centre Energie Materiaux Telecommunications Montreal); Jean-Charles Grégoire (Institut national de la recherche scientifique Centre Energie Materiaux Telecommunications Montreal) In order to mechanically predict audiovisual quality in interactive multimedia services, we have developed machine learning based no-reference parametric models. We have compared Decision Trees based ensemble methods, Genetic Programming and Deep Learning models that have one and more hidden layers. We have used the INRS audiovisual quality dataset specifically designed to include ranges of parameters and degradations typically seen in real-time communications. Decision Trees based ensemble methods have outperformed both Deep Learning and Genetic Programming based models in terms of RMSE and Pearson correlation values. We have also trained and developed models on various publicly available datasets and have compared our results with those of these original models. Our studies show that Random Forests based prediction models achieve high accuracy for both the INRS audiovisual quality dataset and other publicly available comparable datasets.
