Le Roy Tromble Shankar Kumar Stephan Gouws Xiaobing Liu Yonghui Zhifeng Chen Wolfgang Macherey joined Google in 2006 as a research scientist, where he works in the machine translation group with Franz Josef Och. He has been working on natural language processing since 1996. Wolfgang worked as a Research Assistant at RWTH Aachen University from 1999 to 2005. His main research interests are in statistical machine translation and automatic speech recognition with the focus on discriminative training methods, natural language processing, statistical pattern recognition, and machine learning. He received a PhD in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University, Germany, in 2010 and his Diploma Degree in Computer Science from RWTH Aachen University in 1999 with a major in statistical pattern recognition and a minor in physical chemistry and thermodynamics.
