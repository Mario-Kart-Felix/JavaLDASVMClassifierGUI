Due to economic importance of these reviews, there is growing trend of writing user reviews to promote a product. Nowadays, users prefer online blogs and review sites to purchase products. Therefore, user reviews are considered as an important source of information in Sentiment Analysis (SA) applications for decision making. In this work, we exploit the wealth of user reviews, available through the online forums, to analyze the semantic orientation of words by categorizing them into +ive and -ive classes to identify and classify emoticons, modifiers, general-purpose and domain-specific words expressed in the public’s feedback about the products. However, the un-supervised learning approach employed in previous studies is becoming less efficient due to data sparseness, low accuracy due to non-consideration of emoticons, modifiers, and presence of domain specific words, as they may result in inaccurate classification of users’ reviews. Lexicon-enhanced sentiment analysis based on Rule-based classification scheme is an alternative approach for improving sentiment classification of users’ reviews in online communities. In addition to the sentiment terms used in general purpose sentiment analysis, we integrate emoticons, modifiers and domain specific terms to analyze the reviews posted in online communities. To test the effectiveness of the proposed method, we considered users reviews in three domains. The results obtained from different experiments demonstrate that the proposed method overcomes limitations of previous methods and the performance of the sentiment analysis is improved after considering emoticons, modifiers, negations, and domain specific terms when compared to baseline methods.

Introduction The Web is a huge repository of facts and opinions available for people around the world about a particular product, service, issue, policy and health-care [ 1 ]. With the rapid increase in social media sites, individuals are now relying on user review sites for exchanging their personal information, experiences and knowledge [ 2 ].The main focus of the studies in this area has been on issues, such as sentiment detection, sentiment classification at aspect, word, sentence and review levels, opinion spam detection, and context aware sentiment analysis [ 3 ]. However, due to the growing interest in computing the exact sentiment of terms within the SA applications, the sentiment classification at word, sentence and review level become an active area of research [ 4 ]. In most cases, such large number of information seems unstructured for average internet user. However, it attracted many sentiment analysis researchers towards developing such systems that could assist in analyzing user’s reviews efficiently. User generated reviews poses different challenges due to the specialized nature of the online text. The main challenges faced in developing user centric sentiment analysis applications include: (i) emoticon handling, (ii) low accuracy of the classifier in the sentiment analysis of online content, and (iii) incorrect scoring and classification of domain specific words. Firstly, the emoticon handling issue arises due to insufficient coverage of emoticons expressed by users in their posts. The second challenge is to improve the accuracy of classifier by using unsupervised approach with emphasis on modifiers and negations. The third issue is the limited coverage of domain specific words in the existing general purpose lexicons, such as SentiWordNet (SWN), which assigns incorrect scores to most of the domain specific words and may often result in incorrect scoring and classification of sentiments. The sentiment score of a word is generally dependent on a particular domain and changes when a domain switch occurs. The aforementioned issues often result in incorrect detection and classification of users’ sentiments expressed in users’ review sites. Therefore, it is an important task to develop a method to detect and analyze the users’ sentiments from online reviews by automatic classification of reviews as positive, negative or neutral. In this work, we propose a lexicon-enhanced method for improving the sentiment analysis of user generated reviews based on rule-based classification scheme. The main focus is on reducing data sparsity and improving the accuracy of sentiment detection and classification in different domains, effectively reducing the reviews classified as neutral. The proposed method is inspired by the previous studies performed on sentiment analysis of user generated reviews [ 3 , 5 ]. The previous studies have used un-supervised classification to detect and classify the users’ sentiments expressed by online users into +ive, -ive or neutral classes. However, we use the emoticon classifier, modifier &negation classifier, SWN-based classifier (SWNC) in a sequential way to classify the reviews more accurately. Additionally, we input the text to and domain specific classifier (DSC) to assign accurate sentiment scores to domain specific words, which is one of our major contributions in this work. If the results of SWNC and DSC are identical, then the sentence and review is classified as +ive, -ive or neutral accordingly. However, if there is disagreement between the classifications results of SWNC and DSC, then we consider DSC-based results, because it gives more accurate results with respect to consideration of domain specific words. This assists in improving the performance of sentiment analysis system. The main contribution of this work over the state of art methods [ 3 , 5 ] is to handle emoticons, modifiers, negations and domain specific words in an integrated framework. The source code of different modules is available at: https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.p1j71/1 The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents literature review. In section3, we describe the proposed method. Experiment design is presented in section 4, which describes the metrics and discussion on obtained results. The final section outlines the work with a discussion on how it can be expanded in future. Related work There are several studies regarding analysis of users’ sentiments from online forums, with focus on classifying the reviews as positive, negative and neutral. Ferrara and Yang et al. [ 6 ], in their work on quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion invested different issues, such as identification of emotions having widespread usage in online text and, whether +ive sentiments are disseminated more than –ive and vice-versa. It was reported that –ive sentiments spread faster than +ive ones and +ive sentiments develops rapidly for highly anticipated events. They identified and classified additional linguistic rules, such as negations, amplifications and emoticons by adopting SentiStrength algorithm. Their approach didn’t address the issue of domain dependent terms, which is one of a major issue in existing sentiment classification systems. Poria et al. [ 7 ] presented a novel mechanism of extracting features from short multimedia-based heterogeneous data, such as textual, audio and visual clips by training the classifier using convolutional multiple kernel learning. For this purpose, they used Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) model by applying activation values in an inner layer of DCNN. They obtained a performance improvement of about 14% over the baseline methods. Severyn and Moschitti [ 8 ] introduced a convolutional neural network model for performing sentiment analysis of microblogs using deep learning technique. It accurately trains the model without needing any support features. They used an unsupervised neural model for training the seed words which are further subjected to deep learning model. Finally, model is initialized by using pre-trained parameters. Furthermore, supervised learning technique is applied on the Twitter dataset. The system obtained promising results both at phrase level and message level. In their work on extracting sentiment from text, Taboada et al. [ 9 ] developed a Semantic Orientation Calculator (SO-CAL) by using dictionaries of words associated with their sentiment class and score, and includes negation and intensification. The performance of SO-CAL was satisfactory across multiple domains. Moreover, they described the process of dictionary creation and annotation. However, their approach can be enriched by incorporating emoticons and domain specific words for more accurate sentiment classification. Pensa et al. [ 10 ] proposed a concept-level knowledge graph in an integrated framework to represent user behavior on different social media. The active users are tracked by modeling their activities and concepts as well as the relationships with other users. Temporal relationships are also addressed to assist in carrying out temporal analysis. However, incorporation of event detection for automatic detection of hot topics in social networking sites can improve the performance of the system. Cambria in his recent study [ 11 ] reported that emotion recognition and polarity detection are the two basic tasks of affective computing. The former aims at extracting emotion tags and the latter is focused on classifying text into positive and negative classes. The aforementioned tasks are highly co-related and mostly treated in a unified framework for detecting polarity of a sentence and then tagging the sentence with particular emotion category. In many applications, emotion recognition is performed as a subsequent task of sentiment classification. While working on contextual sentiment analysis for social media genres, Muhammad et el. [ 12 ] introduced a lexicon-based sentiment classification method for capturing contextual polarity at local and global levels. The major limitation of lexicon-based approach is incorrect sentiment scoring of opinion words by the existing lexicons, such as SentiWordNet. To address this issue, domain specific vocabulary is introduced to improve the efficacy of sentiment classification. L. Boratto et al. [ 13 ] proposed a technique to detect segments of users for modeling user behavior in advertising. Different data sources are exploited to detect such segments. Firstly, need for user segmentation system is presented to incorporate user preferences successfully, as most of the time is spent by the users on reformulating queries to fulfill their information requirement. Finally, a method is proposed to analyze item description on the basis of user evaluation and extract words in the form of vector notation. The proposed approach is validated by performing experiments on real-world datasets. Kennedy and Inkpen [ 14 ] applied two phase method for measuring the effect of modifiers on classifying the reviews. In the first phase, General Inquirer is used to identify positive terms, negations, intensifiers and diminishers. They obtained improved classification results by extending the term-counting technique with context valence shifters. In second phase, machine learning approach, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used by considering unigrams and valence shifter bigrams. They achieved high classification results by using bigram shifters. The previous studies [ 6 – 10 ] on sentiment analysis used different approaches for analysis, where the supervised learning algorithm [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] is mainly dependent on the availability labeled training dataset. Supervised learning systems are learnt over the labeled training instances to classify the users’ reviews as +ive, -ive or neutral using different features, such as n-grams, part of speech tags and emoticons. Moreover, most of the existing un-supervised approaches [ 3 , 5 ] do not consider emoticons, modifiers, and domain
