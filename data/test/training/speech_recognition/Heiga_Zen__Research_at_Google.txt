Senior Bo Li Fergus Henderson Hasim Sak Mike Schuster Oriol Vinyals Yannis Agiomyrgiannakis Heiga Zen received his AE from Suzuka National College of Technology (www.suzuka-ct.ac.jp), Suzuka, Japan, in 1999, and PhD from the Nagoya Institute of Technology (http://www.sp.nitech.ac.jp/), Nagoya, Japan, in 2006. Before joining Google in 2011, he was an Intern/Co-Op researcher at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY (2004--2005), and a Research Engineer at Toshiba Research Europe Ltd. Cambridge Research Laboratory, Cambridge, UK (2008--2011). His research interests include statistical speech synthesis and recognition. He was one of the original authors and the first maintainer of the HMM-based speech synthesis system, HTS (hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp).
