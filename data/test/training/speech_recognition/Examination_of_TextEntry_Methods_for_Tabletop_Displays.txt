Abstract
Although text entry is a vital part of day-to-day computing
familiar to most people, not much research has been done
to enable text entry on large interactive tables. One might
assume that a good approach would be to choose an exist
ing technique known to be fast, ergonomic, and currently
preferred by the general population, but there are many ad
ditional factors to consider in this specific domain. We con
sider a variety of existing text-entry methods and examine
their viability for use on tabletop displays. We discuss these
techniques not only in terms of their general characteristics
performance, and adoption, but introduce other evaluative
criteria, including: environmental factors unique to large
digital tables and the support for multi-user simultaneous
interaction. Based on our analysis we illustrate by example
how to choose appropriate text-entry methods for tabletop
applications with differing requirements, whether by selec
tion from existing methods, or through a combination of de
sirable elements from a variety of methods. Our criteria
can also be used as heuristics during the iterative design of
a completely new text-entry technique
1. Introduction
Text entry is one of the most frequent actions we under
take when working on desktop computers. Entering text
is necessary for activities that require elaborate text compo
sitions such as coding programs, authoring articles, or writ
ing emails, as well as in situations that demand taking notes
typing in commands, or annotating content
Text-entry methods are equally important for digital ta
bles. Although a large variety of tabletop applications have
been developed in the last decade [4, 5, 31, 32, 36], not
much attention has been paid to the development of text
entry methods for tabletop displays. However, the unique
characteristics and affordances of large digital tables, such
as the support for multiple people and the large horizontal
workspace, demand unique text-entry methods that differ
from traditional physical keyboards. Enabling tabletop text
entry in a way that suits the overall characteristics and affor
dances of large digital tables will make them more viable
for everyday work and entertainment applications
In this paper, we analyze existing text-entry methods that
have been developed for desktop computers, touch sensi
tive tablet PCs, mobile phones, or personal digital assis
tants (PDAs) and examine their potential for use on table
top displays. With this analysis we hope to seed a research
agenda within the tabletop community to develop and eval
uate novel text-entry methods for tabletop displays. While
the research effort for tables has thus far typically focused
on information manipulation and display, our reliance on
the ability to enter text with most other computing technolo
gies suggests that this research direction should be at least
equally important. Our research is intended to help design
ers and developers of tabletop systems to invent or choose
an appropriate text-entry method depending on the tabletop
application’s purpose and character
We first define our evaluative criteria for text entry on
digital tables. We then describe and discuss different cate
gories of existing text-entry methods. After this we discuss
the potential of the examined methods for a variety of table
top applications and provide guidelines for the development
and evaluation of future tabletop text-entry methods
2. Evaluative Criteria
Our examination of text-entry methods is based on crite
ria specifically important in tabletop display environments
These criteria include visual appearance, performance, envi
ronmental factors, and simultaneous interaction
2.1. Visual Appearance
For text-entry methods that have a visual representation of
characters, the visual appearance is defined by the overall
character arrangement (shape) and the character layout
The arrangement of characters determines the over
all shape of the typing device (rectangular, circular, star
shaped, etc.), while the character layout determines where
specific character keys are located within the general ar
rangement (Q next to W, W next to E, etc.) [20]. The most
common character arrangement in western culture follows a
rectangular shape with a QWERTY character layout [19]. As
we will later describe, the character arrangement and layout
can influence the performance of a text-entry method
While most text-entry methods have a visual appearance
for some (e. g. speech recognition and handwriting), these
criteria do not apply
2.2. Performance
The performance of text-entry methods is defined by two
factors: efficiency and ease of learning. An ideal textentry
method would combine these factors to their mutual benefit
2.2.1. Efficiency. Efficiency is most often defined as the
effective text-entry speed that a person can reach using a
certain text-entry method [40]. This speed is usually mea
sured in words per minute (wpm). For text-entry methods
with a visual representation the efficiency is a function of
the visual search time to find a certain character and move
ment time from one character to the next [18, 19]. The char
acter layout, therefore, has an important impact on the effi
ciency since by minimizing distances between consecutive
characters (digraphs) the movement time can be minimized
as well [7, 17, 18, 19]. However, typing speed depends on
several other variables that are hard to control in empirical
studies. For example, the amount of training time on a given
method or the level of familiarity with related typing meth
ods can bias the outcome of typing speed measurements
In addition, to be meaningful, efficiency measures must be
viewed alongside data about typing accuracy
Often, costly long-term studies are required to make con
fident statements about the speed of a certain text-entry tech
nique [40]. In order to save these costs, several predic
tive models have been developed, mostly based on Fitts
law, that can estimate the performance of a textentry
method [8, 18, 39]. However, the accuracy and validity of
such predictive models is problematic because certain pa
rameters within Fitts’ law need to be estimated
Another factor that determines the efficiency of a text
entry method is the visual and cognitive attention it re
quires [40]. The lower the attention demand, the more ef
ficient the text-entry method [40]. As we will describe later
some methods allow for blind typing after training while
other methods always require some visual attention
2.2.2. Ease of Learning. The success of a textentry
method not only depends on its efficiency but also on its
learnability. If it takes a long time to learn a method people
will not adopt it. A new text-entry method will first have
a lower performance than an established method [19,
but potentially can, after training, exceed the existing one
This “crossover point” is an important indicator for ease of
learning
Efficiency and ease of learning often conflict with each
other [35]. Very few text-entry methods have a high ini
tial performance and require little learning to achieve a high
general performance. Therefore, it can be crucial to rate the
importance of efficiency and learnability depending on the
application area the text-entry method is intended for
2.3. Environmental Factors
While text-entry methods have been studied extensively for
the domain of desktop computers [6, 7, 22, 38] or small
portable devices such as cell phones or PDAs [2, 11,
17, 20, 23, 34] not much research has been done for the
domain of tabletop displays. For tabletop text-entry meth
ods the unique characteristics and affordances of tabletop
displays play an important role. We describe some of the
table-specific factors relevant for text entry, such as size, ori
entation, and the support of direct-touch interaction
2.3.1. Space Requirements. Large digital tables have a
large virtual workspace. This allows for tasks that involve
large amounts of information and co-located collaboration
between multiple people [26, 24]. The workspace size
needs to be considered for the design of text-entry meth
ods. Two different approaches are possible: external text
entry methods involving physical devices separate from the
workspace and on-screen methods where the interaction
space and the display space are superimposed. Both ap
proaches have been developed for small displays, but the
affordances of large digital workspaces are quite different
Tabletop displays have more screen real estate available
and so an on-screen text-entry method can use more space
and can involve the use of multiple fingers or twohanded
interaction. However, an on-screen method that is too large
may clutter the display and interfere with the space left avail
able for information items. External methods do not inter
fere directly with the display space, but can require people
to be slightly more removed from the display when enter
ing text. This separation can make it difficult to maintain an
overview of the entire space and an awareness of others in
the environment
With regard to space requirements of a text-entry method
an important criterion to consider is its ability to be col
lapsed (collapsibility). Collapsing the keyboard can be a
way of dealing with the added external or on-screen space
required by a text-entry method. Collapsing can be done for
physical keyboards by, e. g., providing a drawer to hide it or
using a foldable keyboard. For on-screen keyboards, the vi
sual keyboard representation can be collapsed at the request
of the person using it, or automatically after a time delay
Typically, collapsing of physical devices requires more time
and effort than collapsing a virtual on-screen device
2.3.2. Rotatability. The horizontal orientation of table
top displays can also influence text entry. Text input is
orientation-dependent on tables, since the display can be
approached from different directions. It may be desirable
to provide a mechanism (if one does not naturally exist) to
alter the orientation required for entering text. This rotation
can be done for physical devices by rotating the device itself
For on-screen methods, rotation must be supported program
matically. However, we do not yet know how this orienta
tion influences performance. Previous studies have investi
gated the impact of the display angle on touch-tapping as an
input method for text entry [1, 27] but more refined studies
have to be conducted for tabletop displays in particular
2.3.3. Direct-Touch Interaction. Most tabletop systems
support direct-touch interaction using styli or hands [5,
30]. Direct-touch is especially beneficial on tabletop dis
plays because it provides awareness cues to others at the
table. Ideally, a text-entry method would interfere as mini
mally as possible with these cues, allowing fluid transitions
between text-entry and direct-touch interaction. Some exist
ing methods could be disruptive in a tabletop environment
since they require people to switch input methods or devices
preventing a continuous awareness of their actions and the
effects they have on the environment
2.3.4. Mobility. Digital tables afford walking around the
display to obtain an alternative viewpoint, e. g., when look
ing at virtual maps. It may also be desirable to enter text
at any of these possible viewpoints. Ideally, a textentry
method would support entering text from any location, with
out interfering with a person’s physical ability to move
around the table. For example, a wired physical keyboard
may not be appropriate, since the wire would prevent cir
cling the table several times. Carrying a physical device
may also introduce fatigue
2.4. Simultaneous Interaction
Studies have found that tabletop displays provide a space
where many people can work closely together [24]. In order
to support smooth and fluid co-located collaboration, table
top displays need to support simultaneous multi-person in
teraction [26]. This need also must be taken into account
when developing text-entry methods on tabletop displays
To support simultaneous interaction, the following criteria
are important to consider: shareability and duplicability
For applications that require very few and infrequent an
notations, it might be suitable to only provide a single text
entry device that can be easily shared between multiple peo
ple. For other applications, every person interacting with
the digital table may need a text-entry device. Methods that
support the fast duplication of text-entry devices might be
one solution for such applications
In the following section, we examine existing textentry
methods based on the described criteria: their general char
acteristics, their performance, how they can be integrated in
a tabletop environment considering its unique factors, and
how they can support simultaneous multi-person interaction
Table 1 shows an overview of the methods we are examin
ing in terms of the tabletop-related criteria described above
3. Investigating Existing Text-Entry Methods
Existing text-entry methods generally fall into two cate
gories: external methods require an external physical device
and on-screen methods are controlled in the same display
space as the information being displayed (see Table
3.1. External Text-Entry Methods
External text-entry methods include physical keyboards that
traditionally belong to a common desktop computer environ
ment, mobile physical keyboards that can be found on cell
phones or PDAs, and speech recognition techniques
3.1.1. Physical Keyboards. The majority of desktop com
puters provide physical keyboards to enable text entry. A
physical keyboard benefits from tactile feedback, improv
ing the touch-typing performance. Physical keyboards can
vary slightly in shape and character layout, but they are
mostly based on the QWERTY layout described by Sholes
in 1867 [38, 40]. While this layout was initially designed
to avoid jamming on mechanical typewriters, its design sup
ports alternating between both hands while typing
Due to the visual representation of characters, novice
users can apply the “hunt-and-peck” strategy using one or
two fingers. With training, however, people can learn two
handed typing using ten fingers. Experts can even type with
out paying any visual attention to the physical keyboard
According to predictive models, the expert typing speed on
a physical QWERTY keyboard is 56wpm [22]. Various at
tempts to replace the QWERTY layout on physical keyboards
(e. g. the Dvorak keyboard [7] or alphabetical layouts
have remained unsuccessful. Due to the large majority of
people familiar with the QWERTY layout this trend is not
very likely to change
As an external and somewhat large physical device, a
physical keyboard does not lend itself well to a digital table
top environment. Switching back and forth between touch
typing on an external keyboard and direct-touch interaction
within the virtual workspace can be disruptive. Also, a phys
ical keyboard can be hard to move around, rotate, or share
between multiple people. Multiple keyboards can be pro
vided for multiple people interacting on a tabletop display
but the number of keyboards is limited due to their size and
the available space. Another drawback of a physical key
board is that it always requires a physical surface on which
it can be placed. One could imagine drawers to store physi
cal keyboards, installed around a tabletop display. However
this is difficult to integrate into current tabletop setups, es
pecially when the display is projected from below. Storing
and retrieving a physical keyboard would be clumsy, in par
ticular for tabletop tasks that require quick annotations from

time to time. Permanent keyboard ledges would also create
a barrier between people and the interaction space
3.1.2. Mobile Physical Keyboards. We define mobile
physical keyboards as mobile devices that have some sort
of physical text-entry method. Examples for this are mo
bile phones or PDAs that use physical buttons for text en
try. Similar to traditional ones, small physical keyboards
allow touch-typing using fingers, since tactile feedback is
provided. However, on small mobile devices people usually
type with one finger, either while holding the device in the
same hand they are typing with or in their other hand
The visual appearance of mobile physical keyboards varies
from device to device. Small QWERTY keyboards can be
found on some PDAs. Some mobile devices have miniature
alphabetical keyboards, often used with two thumbs. The
most common typing interface on mobile phones is based
on a physical 12-key pad [29]. Studies show that text can
be entered using the T9 extension for text entry [10] at ap
proximately 45.7wpm for expert users
In digital tabletop environments, mobile physical key
boards may be a suitable text-entry method. People can hold
the mobile typing device in one hand while interacting with
the tabletop workspace using the other hand. Physical key
boards with the size of a mobile phone can easily be shared
between people, placed in a pocket or on the physical edge
of the digital table without taking up much space. Many peo
ple are also familiar with the T9 input method from sending
SMSmessages [18]. However, since SMSmessages are typ
ically short, it still needs to be determined if the T9 method
is suitable for typing larger amounts of text
3.1.3. Speech Recognition. An alternative to manual text
entry is the use of automatic speech recognition. We include
this method in the category of external methods, since it usu
ally requires people to wear microphones. Speech recogni
tion as a text-entry method is compelling because it does
not require any learning on the part of the user. The quality
of speech recognition is not dependent people’s skills but
on the technology translating human speech into machine
readable text. Although technology has improved over the
recent years, studies have found that speech recognition is
significantly slower than keyboard typing [13]. Studies have
also revealed that people have more difficulties composing
text by talking out loud than by typing
Speech recognition as a text-entry method on tabletop
displays has the advantage that people can move around and
have both hands free to directly interact within the tabletop
workspace. However, when multiple people are collaborat
ing around a digital table they often divide up a task in order
to work on different aspects individually [25]. With speech
recognition, several people might need to talk out loud at the
same time in order to enter text into the system. Collabora
tors at a tabletop display are likely to be within earshot, so
such simultaneous talking is likely to be highly disruptive
3.2. On-Screen Methods
On-screen text-entry methods are controlled directly within
the display space (typically through touch). Within the
group of on-screen methods, we distinguish between hand
writing, gestural alphabets, and stylus keyboards
3.2.1. Handwriting. Text-entry methods that support natu
ral handwriting by moving a stylus or finger continuously
over the touch-sensitive workspace are similar to speech
recognition in their intuitiveness. Instead of having to
learn a new technique, people can just apply familiar writ
ing skills. In recent years handwriting recognition algo
rithms have been improved to closely match people’s ex
pectations [14]. The performance bottleneck of handwrit
ing, however, is not due to computational but human limi
tations. With approximately 15wpm, the speed of human
hand printing is quite low compared to the performance of
other text-entry methods [15]. Thus, handwriting is not a
suitable entry method for long text passages but might be
sufficient for short annotations
Handwriting as a text-entry method fulfills and comple
ments the unique characteristics and affordances of table
top displays. It supports the mobility of people working
around a tabletop display, it only requires hands or a stylus
and it complements existing direct-touch interaction meth
ods for manipulating virtual artifacts. It also supports inter
action by multiple people without leading to interferences
as with speech recognition. Handwriting is, thus, a highly
lightweight text-entry method for tabletop displays. How
ever, as described above the performance limitations are a
drawback that make it unsuitable for certain tabletop appli
cations. In addition, the relatively low input resolution on
current large digital tables [12] can negatively impact the
accuracy and speed of handwriting recognition. Also, cur
rent input solutions on tabletop displays can cause problems
when resting the hand on the tabletop surface while writing
because the hand could block cameras
3.2.2. Gestural Alphabets. Gestural alphabets were devel
oped to increase the speed and the accuracy of handwrit
ing on touch-sensitive surfaces [9]. Instead of allowing
for individual handwriting, they provide a gestural repre
sentation for each character. Different gestural alphabets
have been developed such as Unistrokes [9] and Graffiti
Most of the effort in developing these alphabets has been
put into making the representations of characters easy to
learn and easy to computationally distinguish from other
characters [9]. Unistrokes’ performance was found to be
34wpm [9, 15]. Although much faster than handwriting
this speed comes at the cost of learnability. Unistrokes was
also found to be harder to learn than Graffiti, which may
explain its low adoption rate
Gestural alphabets were developed for small mobile de
vices that have touch-sensitive displays. With regard to en
vironmental factors unique for tabletop displays, they have
similar advantages as handwriting. Because gestural alpha
bets use fluid gestures with a stylus or finger, they are com
patible with other direct-touch interaction techniques. As
with handwriting recognition, no visual representation is re
quired, thus issues such as collapsibility, rotatability, mobil
ity, shareability, and duplicability do not apply. However
using gestural alphabets on a large display may be problem
atic due to the lack of physical boundaries present on small
mobile devices. This lack of constraints may lead to sloppi
ness” when writing, which has been shown to result in more
recognition errors [9]. Introducing small physical frames as
suggested by Wobbrock et al. [37] may prevent such errors
but requires an additional physical device (a plastic frame
and might be hard to install on a large display
3.2.3. Stylus Keyboards. In contrast to handwriting and
gestural alphabets, stylus keyboards have a visual represen
tation within the virtual workspace. This visual representa
tion can help to guide the novice user. A keyboard in the
virtual workspace also has the advantage that it can be flexi
bly tailored toward the application it is used for or the envi
ronment it is installed in. For digital tables this means that
a stylus keyboard can be easily developed to be collapsi
ble, rotatable, mobile, shareable, and dublicatable. Further
more, direct-touch interaction stylus keyboards are compat
ible with other touch interactions for manipulating virtual
artifacts on a table. Therefore, one might conclude that sty
lus keyboards have the most potential on tabletop displays
However, the performance of stylus keyboards is highly de
sign dependent. Another drawback is that the visual atten
tion required for stylus keyboards is relatively high com
pared to physical keyboards or gestural alphabets
Among stylus keyboards we distinguish between soft
keyboards that are direct visual mappings of physical key
boards with some variations and gesture-based keyboards
that differ in shape to support continuous gesture strokes
Soft Keyboards. The input method for soft keyboards is
touch-tapping, directly mapped from touch-typing on phys
ical keyboards. Although soft keyboards can in theory sup
port text entry using multiple fingers or hands, most existing
systems are for single-finger or stylus input because they
were designed for mobile devices. Soft keyboards typically
have a rectangular or squared shape
The character layout of a soft keyboard directly influ
ences its performance. Many alternatives for the QWERTY
layout have been developed for soft keyboards including
alphabetical layouts, optimized arrangements based on fre
quently used letters and digraphs or arrangements based on
physical models [17, 19, 39]. Prediction models for soft
keyboards estimate an expert typing speed between approx
imately 43.3wpm (for the QWERTY layout) and wpm
(for the FITALY layout [33]) and a novice typing speed of
around 9wpm (QWERTY, FITALY, alphabetical order, and
others) [19]. These values differ largely based on the pre
diction model used and often do not conform with empirical
studies [19, 39]. Also the optimal size of character keys has
been studied for soft keyboards, partly with contradictory
results. Sears et al. [28] state that the smaller the soft key
board the more the typing speed decreases while MacKen
zie et al. [18] found that the error rate on smaller soft key
boards increases but that there is no significant difference
in text-entry speed between small and large soft keyboards
Since all these studies have been conducted on small mobile
devices using one-handed input, they must still be tested in
a tabletop setting to know if their findings generalize. In par
ticular, we expect these values to vary greatly when people
are allowed to use two hands
Gesture-based Keyboards. In contrast to soft keyboards
gesture-based keyboards allow for continuous gestures to
connect different visually presented letters without lifting
the stylus or finger from the tabletop surface while entering
a word. This continuity of gestures can improve textentry
speed [20, 23, 35]. Several gesture-based keyboards have
been developed [11, 20, 23, 34, 35] following different ap
proaches. Some systems show all characters, e. g. in a circu
lar layout [20, 23]. One of the problems with this approach
is that the space for each character decreases which leads to
an either very large keyboard or to very small character keys
that are, as a consequence, hard to select. In order to save
character space, some systems try to divide up characters
in groups and show only the parts of the character set that
are needed [11, 34]. Other systems make use of predictive
language models to visually emphasize characters likely to
follow the previous one and minimize the rest in order to
save space
Gesture-based keyboards, in particular those with hidden
characters and predictive language models, require some
learning. Since touch-tapping seems to be a natural map
ping from touch-typing, and because our everyday worksta
tions still mostly rely on the point-and-click metaphor, a
gesture-based keyboard will first appear unfamiliar to most
people. This lack of familiarity needs to be considered for
certain applications that require immediate efficiency
4. Discussion
The above survey of existing text-entry methods and their
potential usage on tabletop displays shows that there is no
perfect method that can be applied without drawbacks. Al
though according to our analysis physical keyboards seem
to be fairly unsuitable as a text-entry method for large table
top displays, they might be appropriate for applications on
small tables where a limited number of people interact and
rarely change their working positions. In this case, the per
formance benefits of physical keyboards may outweigh the
environmental factors and the need to support simultane
ous interaction. In a multi-person co-located environment
text entry via speech recognition can be awkward when si
multaneous text entry is desired (since people would need
to speak over one another). However, in situations where
text would typically not be entered in parallel, its intuitive
ness and the lack of space constraints may be desirable
For tabletop applications that only require small annotations
from time to time, handwriting or mobile text-entry devices
might be suitable, despite the performance costs
Our survey shows different strengths and weaknesses of
existing text-entry methods in terms of their usage on table
top displays. The character of the tabletop application and
the target user group are important factors to consider when
choosing an appropriate text-entry method or developing a
new one. Therefore, standard user-centred design guide
lines can be customized, focusing on questions such as
• What is the purpose of the tabletop application? Is it a
work application where efficiency is highly important
or a walk-up interface where intuitive usage and visual
adjustibality become more important than efficiency
Does it require small annotations or the input of large
amounts of text
• Who are the people that are going to interact with the
tabletop display? Are they frequent keyboard users
novices, elderly people, children, etc
• How are people going to interact with each other on
the digital table? Does the task require mobility or si
multaneous text entry
• How often will people interact with the system? Will
it be worthwhile for them to learn a new textentry
method or will their use of the table be too infrequent
Although our examination based on our evaluative criteria
does not give clear answers, it shows tendencies and pro
vides guidelines for evaluating existing and new textentry
methods for tabletop displays. The guiding questions above
can help to weigh the criteria depending on the applica
tion area and targeted user group. This weighting can pro
vide important design constraints, informing innovative text
entry methods specifically tailored toward tabletop displays
4.1. Application Scenarios
The following two scenarios give an example of how some
of the examined text-entry methods can be applied for cer
tain tabletop applications. We describe one workplace sce
nario and one public walk-up-and-use scenario
4.1.1. Work Scenario. A tabletop work scenario could in
volve a team of people working on a museum’s catalogue
This task involves digital information in the form of text
passages and photos spread out on a tabletop display. Often
such teams will divide up the work. For example, the graph
ics designer in the team might start to arrange the photos
within a page layout while the content managers work on
the creation of textual content that is still missing, or edit
text passages to fit better into the design. Working together
on the same large display is beneficial because upcoming
questions can be quickly clarified and changes can be done
immediately with the whole team involved. For the graph
ics designer’s task, short annotation within the page layout
is required. Certain parts of the layout may need short com
ments or marks for later refinement. For this task, handwrit
ing is a suitable text-entry method, since it allows a person
to quickly annotate while moving around freely to look at
the page layout from different perspectives. Since the an
notations can be done by hand or with a stylus, it is easy
to switch back and forth between annotating and manipulat
ing content in the tabletop workspace. For the content man
agers who create additional textual content, a physical key
board that is installed in the tabletop system is a good way
to enter text. For them, it is most important to be able to effi
ciently enter large amounts of text into the system. Mobility
or shareability of the text-entry system is not important. For
editing text passages already embedded in the page layout
on the tabletop display, a gesture-based keyboard or gestu
ral alphabet might be most appropriate. They are more ef
ficient and accurate than handwriting but the text passages
can still be edited in place. Both techniques also support a
high amount of mobility and shareability
4.1.2. Walk-up-and-use Scenario. For a company that
designs and develops public tabletop installations for mu
seums or trade shows, intuitiveness and immersiveness of
the tabletop interface have highest priority. Their clients
expect tabletop systems that look visually appealing and
that are tailored toward the theme of the particular exhibi
tion. The tabletop interface needs to invite people to inter
act with it. In this scenario, text-entry functionality can be
provided through soft keyboards. Because they exist in the
virtual space, soft keyboards can be visually tailored toward
a certain look-and-feel that matches the overall tabletop in
terface. A QWERTY character layout and touch-tapping in
put method can be used to capitalize on the familiarity of
most people with QWERTY keyboards. Additionally, lan
guage models that highlight characters with a high probabil
ity to follow the previously typed character can be applied
This helps those not familiar with QWERTY keyboards to
enter text. Mechanisms to collapse soft keyboards can save
work space. In general, soft keyboards can be designed to
be rotatable and translatable across the tabletop workspace
making them easy to share between multiple people. Al
though soft keyboards using a QWERTY layout are not the
most efficient text-entry method, they are highly suitable
for supporting an intuitive and immersive multi-user expe
rience. In contrast to our work scenario, it is acceptable to
sacrifice efficiency for our other evaluative criteria. Namely
the visual appearance should be aesthetically pleasing, the
method should not interfere with the space required for the
main attraction, the entry method should be collapsible, ro
tatable, minimally interfere with direct-touch interaction, al
low people to remain mobile and support many people using
the display simultaneously. An appropriately designed soft
keyboard can achieve a balance between these criteria
4.2. Evaluation of Text Entry Methods
Our examination of existing text-entry methods for their po
tential use on tabletop displays is the first step toward en
abling text entry on tables. As a next step, both their ef
ficiency and their suitability for specific tabletop display
environments need to be empirically evaluated. For effi
ciency testing, predictive models should be developed that
also take two-handed typing into account. These models
are also important for developing new text-entry methods
for tabletop displays since they are less costly than empiri
cal studies. Additionally, observational user studies can pro
vide insights into people’s subjective preferences regarding
text-entry methods for tabletop displays. People’s satisfac
tion is crucial for the adoption of a text-entry method
Long-term studies need to be conducted that provide in
sights into the learning curves of text-entry methods. Al
though some learning-curve studies have been reported for
small mobile devices, their results are not directly applica
ble for tabletop displays due to the different environmental
factors, nor are they directly comparable to each other be
cause they used different study parameters
Since the tabletop research community is just starting
to investigate text-entry methods, we should learn from the
problems encountered studying text-entry methods for mo
bile devices [40]. We as a community need to come up with
consistent methods to empirically study text-entry methods
on tabletop displays for gaining comparable results through
out different research laboratories
In-depth studies of text-entry methods on tabletop dis
plays can lead to the development of new innovative meth
ods specifically tailored toward tabletop displays
5. Conclusion
In this paper we have examined existing text-entry methods
for their potential use on tabletop displays. Our examination
is based on a collection of evaluative criteria that directly
follow from the environmental characteristics of tabletop
displays. We analyzed text-entry methods for their space
requirements, collapsibility, rotatability, their compatibility
with other direct-touch interaction techniques, and their sup
port of mobility, shareability, duplicability, and simultane
ous multi-person interaction
Although our examination cannot provide a clear answer
about which particular text-entry method is the best for
tabletop displays, it reveals tendencies that help to choose
text-entry methods depending on the tabletop application
and targeted user group. While not much research has been
done so far regarding text-entry methods on tabletop dis
plays, our analysis provides first insights into this important
topic. Text entry is an essential activity for all sorts of appli
cations and more research needs to be done regarding how
to support this activity on tabletop displays. The evaluative
criteria we applied for our examination can be understood as
guidelines for the empirical evaluation of existing textentry
methods on tabletop displays and the development of new
techniques specifically tailored toward large digital tables
