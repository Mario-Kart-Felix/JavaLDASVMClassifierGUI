Charting Past, Present, and FutureResearch in Ubiquitous ComputingGREGORY D. ABOWD and ELIZABETH D. MYNATTGeorgia Institute of TechnologyThe proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitousavailability of computing infrastructure it suggests new paradigms of interaction inspired byconstant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, applicationdriven research in ubiquitous computing ubicomp has pushed three interaction themesnatural interfaces, contextaware applications, and automated capture and access. To chart acourse for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of theseefforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitous computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, thephysical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit anew area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction withrespect to time. Just as pushing the availability of computing away from the traditionaldesktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providingcontinuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion.Designing for continuous interaction requires addressing interruption and resumption ofinteraction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherentin all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitouscomputing and the challenges of evaluating ubiquitous computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are nosimple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies,evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to longterm usestudiesbut a usercentric perspective is always possible and necessary.Categories and Subject Descriptors H.5.2 Information Interfaces and PresentationUser InterfacesEvaluationmethodology Interaction styles Prototyping H.5.m Information Interfaces and Presentation Miscellaneous J.m Computer Applications Miscellaneous K.4.2 Computers and Society Social IssuesGeneral Terms Human FactorsAdditional Key Words and Phrases Augmented reality, contextaware applications, captureand access, evaluation, everyday computing, natural interfaces, social implications, ubiquitouscomputing, user interfacesAuthors address College of Computing  GVU Center, Georgia Institute of Technology,Atlanta, GA 303320280 email abowdcc.gatech.edu mynattcc.gatech.edu.Permission to make digital  hard copy of part or all of this work for personal or classroom useis granted without fee provided that the copies are not made or distributed for profit orcommercial advantage, the copyright notice, the title of the publication, and its date appear,and notice is given that copying is by permission of the ACM, Inc.

INTRODUCTIONWeiser introduced the area of ubiquitous computing ubicomp and putforth a vision of people and environments augmented with computationalresources that provide information and services when and where desiredWeiser 1991. For the past decade, ubicomp researchers have attemptedthis augmentation with the implicit goal of assisting everyday life and notoverwhelming it. Weisers vision described a proliferation of devices atvarying scales, ranging in size from handheld inchscale personal devicesto yardscale shared devices. This proliferation of devices has indeedoccurred, with commonly used devices such as handheld personal digitalassistants PDAs, digital tablets, laptops, and wallsized electronic whiteboards. The development and deployment of necessary infrastructure tosupport continuous mobile computation is arriving.Another aspect of Weisers vision was that new applications wouldemerge that leverage off these devices and infrastructure. Indeed, ubicomppromises more than just infrastructure, suggesting new paradigms ofinteraction inspired by widespread access to information and computational capabilities. In this article, we explore how this applications perspective has evolved in the decade since the start of the Ubiquitous Computingproject at Xerox PARC. Specifically, we review the accomplishments andoutline remaining challenges for three themesWe desire natural interfaces that facilitate a richer variety of communications capabilities between humans and computation. It is the goal ofthese natural interfaces to support common forms of human expressionand leverage more of our implicit actions in the world. Previous effortshave focused on speech input and pen input, but these interfaces still donot robustly handle the errors that naturally occur with these systemsalso these interfaces are too difficult to build.Ubicomp applications need to be contextaware, adapting their behaviorbased on information sensed from the physical and computational environment. Many applications have leveraged simple context, primarilylocation and identity, but numerous challenges remain in creating reusable representations of context, and in creating more complex contextfrom sensor fusion and activity recognition.Finally, a large number of ubicomp applications strive to automate thecapture of live experiences and provide flexible and universal access tothose experiences later on.Undertaking issues of scale is implicit in the definition of ubicompresearch. Weiser defined the notion of scale as a broad space of computational devices Weiser 1991. Likewise, scaling systems with respect todistribution of computation into physical space reinforces the desire tobreak the human away from desktopbound interaction. Requirements forcriticalmass acceptance and collaboration imply scaling with respect topeople. A final dimension, time, presents new challenges for scaling a30  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.system. Pushing the availability of interaction to a 24by7 24 hours aday, 7 days a week basis uncovers another class of largely unexploredinteractions that will also push ubicomp research into the next century. Toaddress scaling with respect to time, in Section 5, we introduce a newtheme, called everyday computing, that promotes informal and unstructured activities typical of much of our everyday lives. These activities arecontinuous in time, a constant ebb and flow of action that has no clearstarting or ending point. Familiar examples are orchestrating tasks, communicating with family and friends, and managing information.The structure of this article follows the evolutionary path of past work inubicomp. The first step in this evolution, demonstrated by the PARCTabWant et al. 1995 and Liveboard Elrod et al. 1992, is computers encasedin novel form factors. Often these computational appliances push ontraditional areas in computer science such as networking and operatingsystems. Since these new form factors often do not work well with traditional input devices such as the keyboard and mouse, developing new, andmore natural, input capabilities is the next step. An example of this work isthe penbased shorthand language Unistroke for the PARCTab Goldbergand Richardson 1993. After some initial demonstrations, infrastructure isneeded to deploy these devices for general use. For example, numerous tourguide systems that mimic the first use of Active Badges Want et al. 1992have been built and deployed for real use.It is at this point that application designers begin working with thesenew systems to develop novel uses, often focusing on implicit user input tominimize the intrusion of technology into everyday life. The objective ofthis applicationcentered research is to understand how everyday tasks canbe better supported, and how they are altered by the introduction ofubiquitous technologies. For example, ubicomp applications in support ofcommon meeting tasks at PARC through the Tivoli project have resultedin new ways to scribe and organize materials during meetings. Captureenvironments in educational settings have provided more opportunities tounderstand the patterns of longerterm reviewing tasks over large multimedia records. Applications of wearable computers initially emphasizedconstant access to traditional individual tasks, such as accessing email.More recent applications have attempted to augment an individuals memory and provide implicit information sharing between groups. The directionof applications research, what Weiser himself deemed the ultimate purposefor ubicomp research, is deeply influenced by authentic and extended use ofubicomp systems.Today we are just starting to understand the implications of continuousimmersion in computation. The future will hold much more than constantavailability of tools to assist with traditional, computerbased tasks.Whether we wear computers on our body, or have them embedded in ourenvironment, the ability of computers to alter our perception of the physicalworld, to support constant connectivity to distant people and places, toprovide information at our fingertips, and to continuously partner with usCharting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  31ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.in our thoughts and actions offers much more than a new killer appitoffers the possibility of a killer existence.Overview. In this article, we investigate the brief history of ubiquitouscomputing through exploration of the abovementioned interactionthemesnatural interfaces, contextaware computing, and automated capture and access for live experiences. In addition to reviewing the researchaccomplishments in these application research themes, we also outlinesome of the remaining research challenges for HCI researchers to pursue inthe new millennium. We then explain the necessity for ubicomp research toexplore continuous everyday activities. This area of research motivatesapplications that build off of the three earlier themes and moves ubicompmore into the realm of everyday computing characterized by continuouslypresent, integrative, and unobtrusive interaction. Inherent in all of theseinteraction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating ubiquitous computingresearch. We conclude with our reflections on these issues and description,via case studies, of our current strategies for evaluation of ubicompsystems.2. COMPUTING WITH NATURAL INTERFACESUbiquitous computing inspires application development that is off thedesktop. Implicit in this mantra is the assumption that physical interaction between humans and computation will be less like the current desktopkeyboardmousedisplay paradigm and more like the way humans interactwith the physical world. Humans speak, gesture, and use writing utensilsto communicate with other humans and alter physical artifacts. Thesenatural actions can and should be used as explicit or implicit input toubicomp systems.Computer interfaces that support more natural human forms of communication e.g., handwriting, speech, and gestures are beginning to supplement or replace elements of the GUI interaction paradigm. These interfacesare lauded for their learnability and general ease of use, and their ability tosupport tasks such as authoring and drawing without drastically changingthe structure of those tasks. Additionally, they can be used by people withdisabilities for whom the traditional mouse and keyboard are less accessible.There has been work for many years in speechrelated interfaces, and theemerging area of perceptual interfaces is being driven by a longstandingresearch community in computer vision and computational perceptionTurk 1997 1998. Penbased or freeform interaction is also realizing aresurgence after the failure of the first generation of pen computing. Morerecently, researchers have suggested techniques for using objects in thephysical world to manipulate electronic artifacts, creating socalled graspable Fitzmaurice et al. 1995 or tangible user interfaces Ishii and Ullmer1997. Harrison et al. 1998 have attached sensors to computationaldevices in order to provide ways for physical manipulations of those devices32  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.to be interpreted appropriately by the applications running on thosedevices. Applications that support natural interfaces will leverage off of allof these input and output modalities. Instead of attempting to review theimpressive amount of work in natural interfaces, we focus on two issuesthat are important for enabling the rapid development of effective naturalinterfaces. One important area we will not discuss is that of multimodalintegration, a theme with its own conferences and journals already.2.1 FirstClass Natural Data TypesTo ease the development of more applications with natural interfaces, wemust be able to handle other forms of input as easily as keyboard andmouse input. The raw data or signals that underlie these natural interfacesaudio, video, ink, and sensor inputneed to become firstclass types ininteractive system development. As programmers, we expect that any userinterface toolkit for development provides a basic level of support forfundamental operations for textual manipulation, and primitives forkeyboard and mouse interaction. Similarly, we need basic support formanipulating speechsuch as providing speaker pause cues or selection ofspeech segments or speaker identificationas well as for video and ink andother signals, such as physical device manipulations detected by sensors.Take, for example, freeform, penbased interaction. Much of the interestin penbased computing has focussed on recognition techniques to convertthe ink from pen input to text. However, some applications, such aspersonal notetaking, do not require conversion from ink to text. In fact, itcan be intrusive to the user to convert handwriting into some other form.Relatively little effort has been put into standardizing support for freeform,pen input. Some formats for exchanging pen input between platforms exist,but little effort has gone into defining effective mechanisms for manipulating the freeform ink data type within programs.What kinds of operations should be supported for a natural data typesuch as ink The Tivoli system provided basic support for creating ink dataand distinguishing between uninterpreted, freeform ink data and special,implicitly structured gestures Minneman et al. 1995 Moran et al. 19951996 1997a. Another particularly useful feature of freeform ink is theability to merge independent strokes together as they form letters, words,and other segments of language. In producing Webbased notes in Classroom 2000 discussed in more detail below, for example, we wantedannotations written with a pen by a lecturer to link to the audio or video ofwhat was said or seen at that same time during a lecture Abowd 1999.The annotations are timestamped, but it is not all that useful to associatean individual penstroke to the exact time it was written in class. We used atemporal and spatial heuristic to statically merge penstrokes together andassign them a more meaningful, wordlevel timestamp Abowd et al.1998b. Chiu and Wilcox 1998 have produced a more general and dynamicalgorithm, based on hierarchical agglomeration, to selectively link audioand ink. These structuring techniques need to become standard and availCharting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  33ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.able to all applications developers who wish to create freeform, penbasedinterfaces. And as the work of Chiu and Wilcox demonstrates, some of thestructuring techniques can apply to more than one natural data type.Wemust also think about primitive operations that combine different naturaldata types.2.2 ErrorProne Interaction for RecognitionBased InteractionWhen used for recognitionbased tasks, natural interfaces come with a newset of problems they permit new and more kinds of mistakes. Whenrecognition errors occur, the initial reaction of system designers is to try toeliminate them, e.g., by improving recognition accuracy. However, VanBuskirk and LaLomia 1995 found that a reduction of 510 in theabsolute error rate is necessary before the majority of people will evennotice a difference in a speech recognition system.Worse yet, eliminating errors may not be possible. Even humans makemistakes when dealing with these same forms of communication. For anexample, consider handwriting recognition. Even the most expert handwriting recognizers humans can have a recognition accuracy as low as54 Schomaker 1994. Human accuracy increases to 88 for cursivehandwriting Schomaker 1994, and 96.8 for printed handwriting Frankish et al. 1992, but it is never perfect. This evidence all suggests thatcomputer handwriting recognition will never be perfect. Indeed, computerbased recognizers are even more errorprone than humans. The data theycan use is often less finegrained than what humans are able to sense. Theyhave less processing power. And variables such as fatigue can cause usagedata to differ significantly from training data, causing reduced recognitionaccuracy over time Frankish et al. 1992.On the other hand, recognition accuracy is not the only determinant ofuser satisfaction. Both the complexity of error recovery dialogues Zajicekand Hewitt 1990 and the valueadded benefit for any given effort Frankish et al. 1995 affect user satisfaction. For example, Frankish et al. 1995found that users were less frustrated by recognition errors when the taskwas to enter a command in a form than when they were writing journalentries. They suggest that the payback for entering a single word in thecase of a command is much larger when compared with the effort ofentering the word in a paragraph of a journal entry.Error handling is not a new problem. In fact, it is endemic to the designof computer systems that attempt to mimic human abilities. Research inthe area of error handling for recognition technologies must assume thaterrors will occur, and then answer questions about the best ways to dealwith them. Several research areas for error handling of recognitionbasedinterfaces have emergedError reduction This involves research into improving recognition technology in order to eliminate or reduce errors. It has been the focus ofextensive research, and could easily be the subject of a whole paper on itsown. Evidence suggests that its holy grail, the elimination of errors, isprobably not achievable.34  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.Error discovery Before either the system or the user can take any actionrelated to a given error, one of them has to know that the error hasoccurred. The system may be told of an error through explicit user input,and can help the user to find errors through effective output of uncertaininterpretations of recognized input. Three techniques are used to automate such error discoverythresholding of confidence measures, historical statistics Marx and Schmandt 1994, and explicit rule specificationBaber and Hone 1993.Reusable infrastructure for error correction Toolkits provide reusablecomponents and are most useful when a class of common, similarproblems exists. Interfaces for error handling would benefit tremendously from a toolkit that presents a library of errorhandling techniquesof recognitionbased input. Such a toolkit would have to handle theinherent ambiguities that arise when multiple interpretations are generated for some raw input. A prototype toolkit has been proposed byMankoff et al. 2000 to support reusable recovery techniques, but manychallenges remain.3. CONTEXTAWARE COMPUTINGTwo compelling early demonstrations of ubicomp were the Olivetti Research Labs Active Badge Want et al. 1992 and the Xerox PARCTabWant et al. 1995, both locationaware appliances. These devices leveragea simple piece of context, user location, and provide valuable servicesautomatic call forwarding for a phone system, automatically updated mapsof user locations in an office. Whereas the connection between computational devices and the physical world is not newcontrol systems andautonomously guided satellites and missiles are other examplesthesesimple locationaware appliances are perhaps the first demonstration oflinking implicit human activity with computational services that serve toaugment general human activity.Location is a common piece of context used in application development.The most widespread applications have been GPSbased car navigationsystems and handheld tour guide systems that vary the content displayedvideo or audio by a handheld unit given the users physical location in anexhibit area Abowd et al. 1997 Bederson 1995 Cheverst et al. 1998Opperman and Specht 1998. Another important piece of context is recognizing individual objects. Earlier systems focused on recognizing some sortof barcode or identifying tag, while recent work includes the use ofvisionbased recognition. Fitzmaurice et al. 1993 1995 demonstratedusing a handheld device to see inside walls and pieces of machinery.Rekimoto and Nagaos 1995 NaviCam see Figure 1 recognized colorbarcodes overlaying additional information about objects on a handheldvideo display. Recent efforts Jebara et al. 1997 are attempting to substitute visual object recognition strategies so that objects do not have to beindividually tagged.Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  35ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.Although numerous systems that leverage a persons identity andorlocation have been demonstrated, these systems are still difficult to implement. Salber et al. 1999 created a context toolkit that simplifies designing, implementing, and evolving contextaware applications. This workemphasizes the strict separation of context sensing and storage fromapplicationspecific reaction to contextual information, and this separationfacilitates the construction of contextaware applications. Mynatt et al.1998 point to the common design challenge of creating a believableexperience with contextaware interfaces noting that the responsiveness ofthe interface is key to the person associating additional displays with theirmovements in the physical world.In many ways, we have just scratched the surface of contextawarecomputing with many issues still to be addressed. Here we will discusschallenges in incorporating more context information, representing context,ubiquitous access to context sensing and context fusion, and the coupling ofcontext and natural interaction to provide effective augmented reality.3.1 What Is ContextThere is more to context than position and identity. Most contextawaresystems still do not incorporate knowledge about time, history recent orFig. 1. In Rekimoto and Nagas 1995 NaviCam system, a handheld device recognizes taggedobjects and then overlays contextsensitive information.36  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.long past, other people than the user, as well as many other pieces ofinformation often available in our environment. Although a completedefinition of context is illusive, the five Ws of context are a good minimalset of necessary contextWho Current systems focus their interaction on the identity of oneparticular user, rarely incorporating identity information about otherpeople in the environment. As human beings, we tailor our activities andrecall events from the past based on the presence of other people.What The interaction in current systems either assumes what the user isdoing or leaves the question open. Perceiving and interpreting humanactivity is a difficult problem. Nevertheless, interaction with continuously worn, contextdriven devices will likely need to incorporate interpretations of human activity to be able to provide useful information.Where In many ways, the where component of context has beenexplored more than the others. Of particular interest is coupling notionsof where with other contextual information, such as when. Some tourguide systems have theorized about learning from a history of movements in the physical world, perhaps to tailor information display basedon the perceived path of interest by the user. Again these ideas needfuller exploration.When With the exception of using time as an index into a capturedrecord or summarizing how long a person has been at a particularlocation, most contextdriven applications are unaware of the passage oftime. Of particular interest is understanding relative changes in time asan aid for interpreting human activity. For example, brief visits at anexhibit could be indicative of a general lack of interest. Additionally,when a baseline of behavior can be established, action that violates aperceived pattern would be of particular interest. For example, a contextaware home might notice when an elderly person deviated from atypically active morning routine.Why Even more challenging than perceiving what a person is doing isunderstanding why that person is doing it. Sensing other forms ofcontextual information that could give an indication of a persons affective state Picard 1997, such as body temperature, heart rate, andgalvanic skin response, may be a useful place to start.3.2 Representations of ContextRelated to the definition of context is the question of how to representcontext. Without good representations for context, applications developersare left to develop ad hoc and limited schemes for storing and manipulatingthis key information. The evolution of more sophisticated representationswill enable a wider range of capabilities and a true separation of sensingcontext from the programmable reaction to that context.Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  37ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.3.3 The Ubiquity of Context SensingContext FusionAn obvious challenge of contextaware computing is making it truly ubiquitous. Having certain context, in particular positioning information, hasbeen shown useful. However, there are few truly ubiquitous, singlesourcecontext services. Positioning is a good example. GPS does not work indoorsand is even suspect in some urban regions as well. There are a variety ofindoor positioning schemes as well, with differing characteristics in termsof cost, range, granularity, and requirements for tagging, and no singlesolution is likely to ever meet all requirements.The solution for obtaining ubiquitous context is to assemble contextinformation from a combination of related context services. Such contextfusion is similar in intent to the related, and wellresearched, area ofsensor fusion. Context fusion must handle the seamless handing off ofsensing responsibility between boundaries of different context services.Negotiation and resolution strategies need to integrate information fromcompeting context services when the same piece of context is concurrentlyprovided by more than one service. This fusion is also required becausesensing technologies are not 100 reliable or deterministic. Combiningmeasures from multiple sources could increase the confidence value for aparticular interpretation. In short, context fusion assists in providingreliable ubiquitous context by combining services in parallel, to offset noisein the signal, and sequentially to provide greater coverage.3.4 Coupling ContextAware and Natural InteractionAugmented RealityThe goal of many contextaware applications is to allow the user to receive,in realtime, information based on actions in the physical world. The tourguide systems are a good examplethe users movements in an exhibittriggered the display of additional, contextsensitive information. Theseapplications typically used separate, albeit portable, devices that requireattention away from the rest of the physical world. The best metaphor todescribe these interactions is that the user is probing the world with atool, similar to tools such as electronic stud finders and geiger counters.By incorporating augmented vision and augmented hearing displays, aswell as natural input such as voice and gesture, we will more closelyintegrate contextaware interaction with the physical world in which itresides MacIntyre and Feiner 1996 MacIntyre and Mynatt 1998 Starneret al. 1997. In these interactions, the system is modifying how a userperceives the physical world. This tighter integration of information andperception should allow for more natural, seamless, handsbusy, and serendipitous interaction see Figure 2.4. AUTOMATED CAPTURE AND ACCESS TO LIVE EXPERIENCESMuch of our life in business and academia is spent listening to andrecording, more or less accurately, the events that surround us, and thentrying to remember the important pieces of information from those events.There is clear value, and potential danger, in using computational re38  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.sources to augment the inefficiency of human recordtaking, especiallywhen there are multiple streams of related information that are virtuallyimpossible to capture as a whole manually. Tools to support automatedcapture of and access to live experiences can remove the burden of doingsomething humans are not good at i.e., recording so that they can focusattention on activities they are good at i.e., indicating relationships,summarizing, and interpreting.There has been a good deal of research related to this general captureandaccess theme, particularly for meetingroomclassroom environmentsand personal notetaking. Early work by Schmandt and Arons 1985 andHindus and Schmandt 1992 captured audio from phone conversations andprovided ways to access the content of the recorded conversations. The twosystems, PhoneSlave and Xcapture, treated audio as uninterpreted dataand were successful using simple techniques to provide informative overviews of live conversations. More recent research efforts have tried tocapture other types of input, such as freeform ink. The Tivoli system used asuite of software tools to support a scribe at a meeting Minneman et al.1995 Moran et al. 1996 1997b as well as some electronic whiteboardtechnologythe LiveBoard Elrod et al. 1992to support group discussion. Artifacts produced on the electronic whiteboard during the meetingare timestamped. This temporal information is used after the meeting toindex into recorded audio or video, thus providing the scribe a richer set ofnotes from the meeting. Similar integration between recorded ink annotations and audiovideo is supported in Classroom 2000 for university lectures Abowd 1999 Abowd et al. 1998a 1998b, with a greater emphasis onautomating the postproduction of captured material into universally accessible interfaces for a large population of students. Other capture systems,such as Authoring on the Fly Bacher and Ottmann 1996 and CornellsFig. 2. In the KARMA system on the left augmented views required heavy, clunky,headmounted displays Feiner et al. 1993. Now lightweight glasses, such as the ones shownon the right above from MicroOptical, provide similar display capabilities.Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  39ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.Lecture Browser Mukhopadhyay and Smith 1999, also focus on capture ofpresentations with attention to capturing arbitrary program interactionsand productionquality video capture from multiple sources.These systems focus on the capture of a public, group experience. Othercapture systems, such as Marquee Weber and Poon 1994, Filochat Whittaker et al. 1994, WeMet Wolf and Rhyne 1992, the Audio NotebookStifelman 1996 1997, Dynomite Wilcox et al. 1997, NotePals Davis etal. 1999, and MRAS White et al. 1998, focus on capture for the individual. StuPad Truong et al. 1999 was the first system to provide mixedpublic and personal capture.Most of the above efforts produce some sort of multimedia interface toreview the captured experience. By focusing on this postproduction phase,some systems provide automated support for multiple camera fusion,integration of various presentation media, and contentbased retrievalmechanisms to help search through a large repository of captured information. The postproduction results can then be accessed through a multimedia interface, typically distributed via the Web. Abowd 1999 provides areview of some of these research and commercial systems.In all of these cases, the emphasis on ubiquity is clearly seen in theseparate capture and access phases. Electronic capture is moved away fromtraditional devices, like the keyboard, and brought closer to the user in theform of penbased interfaces or actual pen and paper. Input in the form ofvoice and gesture is also accepted and is either treated as raw data orfurther interpreted to provide more understanding of the captured experience.4.1 Challenges in Capture and AccessDespite substantial research and advances in automated capture systems,there are a number of open research issues, that we summarize here. Weseparate out issues primarily associated with capture from those primarilyassociated with access.4.1.1 Capture. We have mentioned earlier the importance of having agood driving application for ubicomp research. In the capture domain, themain compelling applications have been for meeting support and educationtraining. These are indeed compelling application areas. In particular, ourevidence in Classroom 2000 points to overwhelming acceptance of capturefrom the student perspective Abowd 1999. There are many more possibilities, however, for exploring capture in equally compelling domainsMany of us record the special events in our livesvacations, birthdayparties, visits from relatives and friendsand we often spend time, yearslater, reflecting and remembering the events through the recordings onfilm and in diaries. How many times have we wished we had a camera ata particularly precious moment in our lives a childs first steps only tofumble for the recording device and miss the moment How difficult is itsometimes to find the picture or film of a significant event40  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.In many collaborative design activities, the critical insights or decisionsare often made in informal settings and are usually not documentedproperly. Technical exchanges often flow quite freely in opportunisticencounters. Even in more formal design meetings, the rich exchange ofinformation and discussions around artifacts, such as storyboards orarchitectural recommendations, is often very poorly captured. Recently,we have begun experimenting with support to capture both informalbrainstorming activities Brotherton et al. 1999 and structured designmeetings Richter et al. 1999.Maintenance of a building might be better supported if we captured arecord of the actual construction of the buildingin contrast to thebuilding plans. When repairs are needed, the appropriate techniciancould replay the construction and maintenance history of the relevantbuilding artifact in order to determine the right course of repair.With the exception of the Audio Notebook, NotePals and Cornells Lecture Browser, there has been little work on capturing artifacts in thephysical world and making them easily accessible in the access phase. Theemergence of lowcost capture hardware, such as the CrossPady and themimioy from Virtual Ink, will lead more researchers to work in this area.Much of the capture currently being done is for what we would call rawstreams of information that are captured mainly for the purpose of directplayback. No further analysis on those streams is done. However, it is oftenuseful to derive additional information from a simple stream to provide agreater understanding of the live event. For example, Stifelman usedresults from discourse analysis to further segment the captured audiostream and make better prediction about when new topics commenced in adiscussion Stifelman 1997. Similarly, Chiu and Wilcox 1998 proposed ahierarchical agglomeration technique for using pause detection to segmentand associate both ink and audio. Other computational perception techniques can be used to analyze the simple audio, ink, or video signals.Another application of signal analysis is to improve the recording of rawstreams. How can we automate certain wellknown production practicesthat merge multiple camera feeds into a single, coherent, highqualityvideo that can be viewed later Single, fixed camera angles are notsufficient to capture the salient parts of a live experience, but when wescale a system like Classroom 2000 to an entire campus, we cannot affordto pay technicians to sit in each of the classrooms. The single biggestchallenge here is being able to determine the focus of attention for thegroup, and more difficult, for each individual at a live event.4.1.2 Access. In the access phase, we need to provide a number ofplayback capabilities. The simplest is to playback in real time, but thereare often situations in which this is inappropriate or overly inefficient. Inreviewing a lecture for an exam, a student does not always want to sitthrough an entire lecture again, but he or she might want to pinpoint aparticular topic of discussion and replay only that portion. Alternatively, aCharting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  41ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.summarization of the experience which gleans salient points from across anentire captured session might be more appropriate.Synchronization of multiple captured streams during playback is vital.Commercial streaming products, such as RealNetworks G2SMILy andMicrosofts MediaPlayerASFy, are emerging standards to allow for powerful synchronization of programmerdefined media streams. However, it isnot clear that any of these products will support the foreshadowing ofstreams so that a user can see what lies ahead in reviewing a stream. Suchforeshadowing can help a user skim more quickly to a point of interest.In most of the systems, the captured material is static upon reaching theaccess phase. Of course, there are often cases where annotating or revisingcaptured material is appropriate, as well as then revising revised notes andso on. Although versioning is not a new problem to computer scientists,there are numerous challenges in providing an intuitive interface tomultiple versions of captured material, especially when some of the material is already timebased such as audio and video. A timeline is aneffective interface for manipulating and browsing a captured session, butwhen the time associated with a captured artifact is split up into a numberof noncontiguous time segments, the usefulness of the timeline is at leastquestionable. Newer timebased interaction techniques, such asLifestreams Fertig et al. 1996, Timewarp Edwards and Mynatt 1997,and timemachine computing Rekimoto 1999 are good starting points.Finally, and perhaps most challenging, as these systems move frompersonalized systems to capturing events in more public settings, privacyconcerns for the capture and later access of this material increase. Although these issues must be addressed in the specific design of eachsystem, we still need general techniques for tagging material and authenticating access. We will discuss these issues later in this article.5. TOWARD EVERYDAY COMPUTINGEarlier, we described an emerging area of interaction research, everydaycomputing, which results from considering the consequences of scalingubiquitous computing with respect to time. Just as pushing the availabilityof computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes therelationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant presence. Ourmotivations for everyday computing stem from wanting to support theinformal and unstructured activities typical of much of our everyday lives.These activities are continuous in time, a constant ebb and flow of actionthat has no clear starting or ending point. Familiar examples are orchestrating tasks, communicating with family and friends, and managinginformation.Designing for everyday computing requires addressing these features ofinformal, daily activitiesThey rarely have a clear beginning or end Either as a fundamentalactivity, such as communication, or as a longterm endeavor, such as42  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.research in humancomputer interaction, these activities have no point ofclosure. Information from the past is often recycled. Although new namesmay appear in an address book or new items on a todo list, the basicactivities of communication or information management do not cease. Abasic tenet in HCI is designing for closure. Given a goal, such asspellchecking a document, the steps necessary to accomplish that goalshould be intuitively ordered with the load on shortterm memory held toa reasonable limit. The dialogue is constrained so that the goal isaccomplished before the user begins the next endeavor. When designingfor an activity, principles such as providing visibility of the current state,freedom in dialogue, and overall simplicity in features play a prominentrole.Interruption is expected Thinking of these activities as continuous, albeitpossibly operating in the background, is a useful conceptualization. Onesideeffect is that resumption of an activity does not start at a consistentpoint, but is related to the state prior to interruption. Interaction must bemodeled as a sequence of steps that will, at some point, be resumed andbuilt upon. In addition to representing past interaction, the interface canremind the user of actions left uncompleted.Multiple activities operate concurrently Since these activities are continuous, the need for contextshifting among multiple activities is assumed.Application interfaces can allow the user to monitor a backgroundactivity, assisting the user in knowing when he or she should resumethat activity. Resumption may be opportunistic, based on the availabilityof other people, or on the recent arrival of needed information. Forexample, users may want to resume an activity based on the number ofrelated events that have transpired, such as reading messages in anewsgroup only after a reasonable number of messages have beenpreviously posted. To design for background awareness, interfaces shouldsupport multiple levels of intrusiveness in conveying monitoring information that matches the relative urgency and importance of events.Current desktop interfaces only provide a small beginning in addressingthese issues with multiple windows in a desktop interface. With minimalscreen real estate, users must manage opening, closing, and restackingthe many windows associated with a variety of tasks. Simple awarenesscues are included in some desktop icons, indicating that new email hasbeen received for example, but there are few controls for creating levelsof notification to meet different awareness needs. The Rooms interfacepresented a compelling interface for spatially organizing documents andapplications in multiple persistent working spaces Card et al. 1999Henderson et al. 1986. This standard has yet to be met by currentcommercial task bars for changing application focus. A useful extensionto Rooms would be both to provide awareness of background rooms, andto assist the user in remembering past activity when returning to a room.Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  43ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.Time is an important discriminator Time is a fundamental humanmeasuring stick although it is rarely represented in computer interfaces.Whether the last conversation with a family member was last week orfive minutes ago is relevant when interpreting an incoming call from thatperson. When searching for a paper on a desk, whether it was last seenyesterday or last month informs the search. There are numerous ways toincorporate time into humancomputer interfaces Edwards and Mynatt1997 Fertig et al. 1996 Rekimoto 1999. As we try to regain our workingstate, interfaces can represent past events contingent on the length oftime minutes, hours, days since the last interaction. As applicationsinterpret realworld events, such as deciding how to handle an incomingphone call or to react to the arrival at the local grocery store, they canutilize timing information to tailor their interaction.Associative models of information are needed Hierarchical models ofinformation are a good match for welldefined tasks, while models ofinformation for activities are principally associative, since information isoften reused on multiple occasions, from multiple perspectives. Forexample, assume you have been saving email from colleagues, friends,and family for a long time. When dealing with current mail, you mayattempt to organize it into a hierarchy of folders on various topics. Overtime, this organization has likely changed, resulting in a morass ofmessages that can be searched with varying degrees of success. Likewise,interfaces for todo lists are often failures given the difficulty in organizing items in welldefined lists. Associative and contextrich models oforganization support activities by allowing the user to reacquire theinformation from numerous points of view. These views are inherent inthe need to resume an activity in many ways, for many reasons. Forexample, users may want to retrieve information based on currentcontext such as when someone enters their office or when they arrive atthe grocery store. They may also remember information relative to othercurrent information, e.g., a document last edited some weeks ago or thedocument that a colleague circulated about some similar topic.As computing becomes more ubiquitously available, it is imperative thatthe tools offered reflect their role in longerterm activities. Althoughprinciples in everyday computing can be applied to desktop interfaces,these design challenges are most relevant given a continuously changinguser context. In mobile scenarios, users shift between activities while thecomputing resources available to them also vary for different environments. Even in an office setting, various tools and objects play multipleroles for different activities. For example, use of a computeraugmentedwhiteboard varies based on contextual information such as people present.Different physical objects such as a paper file or an ambient display canprovide entry points and background information for activities. This distribution of interaction in the physical world is implicit in the notion ofeveryday computing, and thus clearly relevant to research in ubiquitouscomputing.44  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.5.1 Synergy Among ThemesResearch in everyday computing also continues to explore the three earlierinteraction themes, but with the focus of designing a continuously availableenvironment. Ishiis work in tangible media explores using natural interfaces to support communication and background awareness Ishii andUllmer 1997. Current efforts in Roomware Streitz et al. 1999 aim tocreate wallsized and tablelike interaction areas that support a greaterrange of informal human activity.With respect to contextaware interaction, Audio Aura Mynatt et al.1998 is clearly related to previous tour guide systems, as a change inlocation triggers information delivery on a portable device. The motivationfor Audio Aura, however, is to continuously augment the backgroundauditory periphery of the user. By adding dynamic information about theactivity of colleagues and communication channels e.g., email, Audio Auraenhances the perceptible sphere of information available while the usercontinues with daily activities.Likewise, applications for automated capture and access are moving intoless structured environments. The Remembrance Agent Rhodes 1997Rhodes and Starner 1996 retrieves information based on physical contextinformation including visual recognition. As the user can instruct thesystem about what to remember, the agent becomes a storehouse ofeveryday information that is continuously available, but indexed based onphysical location. An unmet goal, first proposed by Bush 1945 is thedesign of personal memory containers that record continuously and latertry to provide useful indices and summaries of the daily information theycapture see Lamming and Flynn 1994.5.2 Research Directions in Everyday ComputingEveryday computing offers many challenges to the HCI research community. In our current and future work, we are focusing on the followingchallengesDesign a continuously present computer interface There are multiplemodels for how to portray computers that are ubiquitous, although noneof these models are wholly satisfying. The notion of an informationappliance Norman 1998 typically reflects a specialpurpose device thatsits dumbly in the background without any knowledge of ongoingactivity. These interfaces often borrow from traditional GUI concepts andfrom consumer electronics. Computational systems that continue tooperate in the background, perhaps learning from past activity andacting opportunistically, are typically represented as anthropomorphizedagents. However it is doubtful that every interface should be based ondialogue with a talking head or humanoriented personality. Research inwearables explores continually worn interfaces Starner et al. 1997, butthese are limited by the current input and display technologies and aretypically rudimentary textbased interfaces.Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  45ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.Presenting information at different levels of the periphery of humanattention Despite increasing interest in tangible media and peripheralawareness, especially in computersupported collaborate work CSCWand wearable computing, current interfaces typically present a genericperipheral backdrop with no mechanism for the user, or the backgroundtask, to move the peripheral information into the foreground of attention.Our current design experiments are aimed at creating peripheral interfaces that can operate at different levels of the users periphery.Connecting events in the physical and virtual worlds People operate intwo disconnected spaces the virtual space of email, documents, and Webpages and the physical space of facetoface interactions, books, andpaper files. Yet human activity is coordinated across these two spaces.Despite efforts as early as the Digital Desk Wellner 1993 there is muchwork left to be done to understand how to combine information fromthese spaces to better match how people conceptualize their own endeavors.Modifying traditional HCI methods to support designing for informal,peripheral, and opportunistic behavior There is no one methodology forunderstanding the role of computers in our everyday lives. However,combining information from methods as different as laboratory experiments and ethnographic observations is far from simple. In our researchand classroom projects, our goal is to learn by doing, by interrogating theresults we derive from different evaluation strategies. We have consciously chosen a spectrum of methods that we believe match the questions we are asking. Learning how these methods inform each other andhow their results can be combined will be an ongoing effort throughoutour work. We continue this discussion in the next section on evaluatingubicomp systems.6. ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FOR UBICOMPTwo important topics for ubicomp researchevaluation and social implicationscut across all themes of research, so we address them here.6.1 Evaluating Ubicomp SystemsIn order to understand the impact of ubiquitous computing on everydaylife, we navigate a delicate balance between prediction of how noveltechnologies will serve a real human need and observation of authentic useand subsequent coevolution of human activities and novel technologiesCarroll and Rosson 1991. Formative and summative evaluation of ubicomp systems is difficult for several reasons, which we will discuss. Thesechallenges are why we see relatively little published from an evaluation orenduser perspective in the ubicomp community. A notable exception is thework published by Xerox PARC researchers on the use of the Tivoli capturesystem in the context of technical meetings Moran et al. 1996. Sinceresearch in ubiquitous computing will have limited impact in the HCI46  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.community until it respects the need for evaluation, we have some advicefor those wishing to undertake the challenges.6.1.1 Finding a Human Need. The first major difficulty in evaluating aubicomp system is simply having a reliable system to evaluate. Thetechnology used to create ubicomp systems is often on the cutting edge andnot well understood by developers, so it is difficult to create reliable androbust systems that support some activity on a continuous basis. Consequently, a good portion of reported ubicomp work remains at this level ofunrobust demonstrational prototypes. This kind of research is often criticized as being technocentric, but as we will show, it is still possible to dogood usercentered feasibility research with cuttingedge technology.It is important in doing ubicomp research that a researcher build acompelling story, from the endusers perspective, on how any system orinfrastructure to be built will be used. The technology must serve a real orperceived human need, because, as Weiser 1993 noted, the whole purposeof ubicomp is to provide applications that serve the humans. The purpose ofthe compelling story is not simply to provide a demonstration vehicle forresearch results. It is to provide the basis for evaluating the impact of asystem on the everyday life of its intended population. The best situation isto build the compelling story around activities that you are exposed to on acontinuous basis. In this way, you can create a living laboratory for yourwork that continually motivates you to support the story and providesconstant feedback that leads to better understanding of the use.Designers of a system are not perfect, and mistakes will be made. Since itis already a difficult challenge to build robust ubicomp systems, you shouldnot pay the price of building a sophisticated infrastructure only to find thatit falls far short of addressing the goals set forth in the compelling story.You must do some sort of feasibility study of cuttingedge applicationsbefore sinking substantial effort into engineering a robust system that canbe scrutinized with deeper evaluation. However, these feasibility evaluations must still be driven from an informed, usercentric perspectivethegoal is to determine how a system is being used, what kinds of activitiesusers are engaging in with the system, and whether the overall reactionsare positive or negative. Answers to these questions will both inform futuredesign as well as future evaluation plans. It is important to understandhow a new system is used by its intended population before performingmore quantitative studies on its impact.Case Study Xerox PARCs Flatland. Designing ubiquitous computingapplications requires designers to project into the future how users willemploy these new technologies. Although designing for a currently impossible interaction is not a new HCI problem, this issue is exacerbated by theimplied paradigm shift in HCI resulting from the distribution of computingcapabilities into the physical environment.In our design work for Flatland Mynatt et al. 1999, we employedethnographic observations of whiteboard use in the office, coupled withquestionnaires and interviews, to understand how people used their whiteCharting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  47ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.boards on a daily basis see Figure 3. The richness of the data from theobservations was both inspirational in our design work and a usefulconstraint. For example, the notion of hot spots, portions of the board thatusers expect to change frequently, was the result of daytoday observationsof real whiteboard use. The data from the observations were key ingrounding more indepth user studies through questionnaires and interviews. Without these data, discussions would too easily slip into what usersthink they might do. By referring to two weeks of observational data, wewere able to uncover and examine the details of daily practice.Although the technology for our augmented whiteboard was not ready fordeployment, or even user testing, we were able to gather a wealth ofinformation from observations and interviews that critically informed ourdesign.Case Study Audio Aura. The affordances and usability issues of novelinput and output technologies are not well understood when they are firstintroduced. Often these technologies are still unusable for any real, longterm use setting. Nevertheless usercentric evaluations are needed toinfluence subsequent designs. In the design of Audio Aura Mynatt et al.1998, we were interested in exploring how peripheral awareness of relevant office activities could be enhanced through use of ambient sound in amobile setting. Our combination of active badges, wireless headphones, andaudio generation was too clunky for real adoption by longterm users. Theheadphones were socially prohibitive as they covered the ears with large,black shells. The capabilities for the development language, Java, to controlsound presentation were too limited for creating rich auditory spaces.Nevertheless, we wanted to understand the potential interaction knowingthat these technological limitations would be removed in the future.We employed scenarios of interaction, based on informal observations ofthe Xerox PARC work environment, to guide our design and evaluation.These scenarios incorporated information about how people at PARC worktogether, including practices such as gathering at the coffee bistro, oftendropping by peoples offices for impromptu conversations, and even thephysical oddities of the building such as the long hallways that are thebackbone of the layout. By grounding our scenarios in common practices,potential users could reflect on their daily activities when evaluating ourdesigns. The scenarios also helped us understand a particular interactionissue timing. In one of our scenarios, the communication path between thecomponent technologies was not fast enough to meet the interaction demands. Although the speed could be increased, this modification requiredbalancing a set of tradeoffs, namely speed versus scalability, both important for our design goals. In short, the scenarios helped us understand thedesign space for further exploration.6.1.2 Evaluating in the Context of Authentic Use. Deeper evaluationresults require real use of a system, and this, in turn, requires a deployment into an authentic setting. The scaling dimensions that characterizeubicomp systemsdevice, space, people, or timemake it impossible to use48  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.traditional, contained usability laboratories. Effective evaluation, in whichusers are observed interacting with the system in routine ways, requires arealistic deployment into the environment of expected use.Case Study Classroom 2000. In this last case study, centered at Georgia Tech, we demonstrate a much longer term research project that evolvedfrom early prototyping and feasibility studies into a more mature systemthat is currently used by a large population in a living classroom laboratory, shown in Figure 4. The project began in July 1995 with the intent ofproducing a system that would capture as much of the classroom experiFig. 3. In the design of Flatland, we used observations of whiteboard use to inform ourdesign. Here whiteboard drawings ont wo different boards are used as the basis for discussingthe complex concepts illustrated with more detail in the bottom slide.Charting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  49ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.ence as possible to facilitate later review by both students and teachers. Inmany lectures, students have their heads down, furiously writing downwhat they hear and see as a future reference. While some of this writingactivity is useful as a processing cue for the student, we felt that it wasdesirable from the student and teacher perspective to afford the opportunity for students to lift their heads occasionally and engage in the lectureexperience. The capture system was seen as a way to relieve some of thenotetaking burden.We needed to test the feasibility of this hypothesis quickly, so within sixmonths of the project launch, we provided an environment to capture anentire course and observe whether our initial hypothesis was worth testingmore vigorously. We learned some very valuable lessons during this firstextended experience. The initial experiments included student notetakingdevices that were clear distractions to the students Abowd 1999, so weabandoned that part of the experiment, only to resume it in the past fewmonths when the technology had caught up Truong et al. 1999. We alsolearned from this initial experience that in order to understand the impactof this capture system on teaching and learning we would have to gatherusage data from a larger set of classes. This required significant engineering effort to create a robust and reliable capture system that by the SpringQuarter of 1997 was able to support multiple classes simultaneously.Today, after capturing over 100 courses with 30 different instructors, wehave gained significant insight into how the system is used and whatfuture directions to take Abowd 1999. As a direct result of these deeperevaluations, we know that the system encourages 60 of its users to modifytheir inclass notetaking behavior. We also know that not all of thisFig. 4. In the Classroom 2000 project, we have had the ability to learn from longterm actualuse in the Georgia Tech educational environment.50  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.modified behavior is for the better. Taking no notes, for example, is not agood learning practice to reinforce. We know that it is time to reintroducestudent notetaking units that can personalize the capture experience andalso encourage better notetaking practices. We also know to facilitate morecontentbased retrieval and synchronized playback of the lecture experience. These insights have motivated further research efforts and established a longterm research project, eClass see httpwww.cc.gatech.edufceeclass, that stands as a model for ubicomp research and automatedcapture and access.6.1.3 TaskCentric Evaluation Techniques Are Inappropriate. Assumingan authentic deployment can occur, when users are comfortable with theservice being provided and have developed habits for using the service,there is still the question of how to apply qualitative or quantitativeevaluation methods. The majority of usability techniques are taskcentric.If the users tasks are known, then an evaluation is performed to determinethe fitness of the system and its interface for completing that task. It is notat all clear how to apply taskcentric evaluation techniques to informaleveryday computing situations.6.2 Social Issues for Ubiquitous ComputingWe are pushing toward making it easier for computation to sense, understand, and react to phenomenon in the physical world and to record thosephenomena. These enabling technologies carry with them numerous dangers, e.g., making it too easy for people to build systems that effectively spyon others without any controlling authority. Ubicomp researchers would beremiss if they undertook their work without understanding these issues.However, the fear of wrongdoing is not a call to cease all work in this area,but to work toward technological, design, and social solutions to addressthese concerns.A basic concern about any information stored in a computer is knowingwho can access and modify the contents. Where are the bits Are theysecure Security and encryption schemes are part of the technologicalsolutions available, especially as information is gleaned from the environment and transported over networks. Alternatively, work in wearablecomputing emphasizes a design approachproviding security by keepingthe bits local on the body and removing the risks of transporting themover a public network.One fear of users is the lack of knowledge of what some computingsystem is doing, or that something is being done behind their backs.Although the original vision of ubiquitous computing described computingas disappearing into the physical environment, this invisibility is counterto informing users about how they are being sensed. To assuage that fear,design solutions can be employed to make this information visible. Forexample, systems that sense physical phenomena and capture live situations should provide clear indicators that this sensing or recording isoccurring. As these sensing and recording capabilities are more commonlyCharting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  51ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.found, one challenge for everyday computing is to enable people to be awareof how they are being sensed. Just as people can ascertain their visibility inphysical space How public is this space Are there windows we need cuesto convey our visibility in virtual space.The next step is to allow those being sensed or recorded to have control toeither stop this activity or to at least control the distribution and use of theinformation. This challenge is related to the design of collaborative environments where the actions and roles of collaborators are fluid and difficultto articulate in a static snapshot. The capture, distribution, and use ofinformation will be determined over time by the specific practices of peopleis workplace and home settings.There are a number of reactions that system builders can have forhandling the sensitive topic of when and what to capture. At Xerox PARC,one solution for capture was to agree to only capture the summary portionsof technical meetings. In Classroom 2000, we defaulted to recording all of alecture, but did not attempt to obtain good quality audio or video of anyoneexcept the lecturer in the front of the room. In the Dynomite system fromFXPAL, the notetaker exercised control over which portions of the audiorecording could be kept for future reference Wilcox et al. 1997. Thoughthis last solution was first presented as a means of reducing the amount ofstorage requirements for highfidelity audio, we see merit in this approachfrom an individuals perspective to enable an otherwise perfect capturesystem to forget some part of the past. An interesting challenge forcollaborative situations is to figure out acceptable policies for erasing orforgetting some shared memory. A more positive slant on this issue wouldfocus on ways to accommodate heightening awareness of particularlyvaluable segments of a captured experience in lieu of eliminating orforgetting parts of a captured history.Although issues surrounding the appropriate use and dissemination ofinformation are as old as the dawn of human communication, specificconcerns stem from ubicomp making a new kind of information moregenerally available. The fact that computers can easily track our dailyactivitiesa feat that previously required a large amount of human effortis disconcerting at the least. In addition to addressing the abovementioned concerns of security, visibility, and control, our approach is tocreate designed examples of appropriate and beneficial uses of this information. For example, one affordance of the lowquality video in early mediaspaces was that the amount of information conveyed was more sociallyappropriate. The notrealtime, grainy images met important needs forawareness and feelings of connectivity without violating privacy concerns.In the design of Audio Aura Mynatt et al. 1998, we took great care inconveying qualitative information about the activities of colleagues. Whenstopping by someones office, information that could be obtained by thesystem e.g., this person has not been in his office for a few hours was akinto the information that someone in a neighboring office could provide.There are other social issues as well that are not as directly linked toprivacy. For example, recording a meeting or a lecture can have both52  G. D. Abowd and E. D. MynattACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.positive and negative impact on those in attendance. On the positive side,knowledge of recording encourages people to be less reckless in theircommentary. On the negative side, this same knowledge can cause peopleto refuse to contribute to a discussion for fear of saying something thatwould be regretted in the future. A more subtle problem was noticed in ourextensive experience in Classroom 2000. Some students indicated that theychose not to ask questions in class because the answer was likely alreadydiscussed and it was up to the student to go back and listen to the lecture.In general, social and legal practices continue to evolve in concert withtechnological and design innovations. In each situation people will comparethe perceived benefits and costs of the uses of ubicomp technologies. Forexample, skiers and hikers choose to wear radio transponders so they canbe located by rescue personnel. Firefighters benefit from understandingwhat each of them is doing and where they are located. Recent researchdetails the calendaring practices at Sun Microsystems Grudin and Palen1997 where colleagues share extensive information about their dailycollaborative activities. As discussed in the previous section on evaluation,our understanding of the social implications of these technologies will oftencome after people invent new, unforeseen, uses of these technologies.Although the sand is always shifting beneath us, attention to issues ofsecurity, visibility, control, and privacy should help ensure a more positiveuse of these technologies.7. CONCLUDING THOUGHTSIn this article, we have attempted to outline the trajectory of ubicompresearch in the decade since the inspiring work of Weiser and colleagues atXerox PARC. We have identified three research themes for ubicomp,provided some background on significant achievements in those areas, aswell as highlighted some of the remaining challenges. We have done thiswith the desire to motivate budding ubicomp researchers to attack someimportant and welldefined problems. We no doubt have left out some otherimportant challenges for ubicomp research, and we look forward to seeingthose problems articulated and solved by others.Weiser 1993 claimed that the whole point of ubiquitous computing wasto create compelling applications that would drive the development ofdevices and infrastructure. We agree in spirit with this claim, but want topromote a broader view that promotes the generalpurpose utility andchallenge of ubiquitous interaction with computational resources. Theapplication or taskcentric focus has been a fruitful one for HCI research. Ifwe look at successful computing technology, however, it is not the case thata single application has driven criticalmass acceptance and deployment.What is the motivating application for the personal computer in our officeor home, or for a Palm Piloty There are many applications, different foreach person. The real goal for ubicomp is to provide many singleactivityinteractions that together promote a unified and continuous interactionbetween humans and computational services. The focus for the human atCharting Past, Present, and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing  53ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interaction, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 2000.any one time is not a single interface to accomplish some task. Rather, theinteraction is more freeflowing and integrative, akin to our interactionwith the rich physical world of people, places, and objects in our everydaylives.ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThe authors would like to acknowledge the significant inspiration from thelate Mark Weiser, who died somewhat suddenly during initial drafts of thisarticle. Marks vision and enthusiasm influenced a countless number ofresearchers, and we are indebted to his contributions in many ways. Wewould also like to acknowledge the interactions and influence of a numberof colleagues from Xerox PARC and the Georgia Techs Future ComputingEnvironments Group within the College of Computing.REFERENCESABOWD, G.
