From tools to manipulate data, to shared spaces in which people collaborate. Today we are connected to such extent that a considerable part of HumanComputer Interaction could be called HumanComputerHuman Interaction. Computer and groupware interfaces are getting more usable but todays massmarket solutions cannot possibly meet specific groups of users requirements. Therefore customizability of the interfaces must be increased. In other words, groups of users should be able to adjust an interface to their specific needs. This groupware technology, connectivity and customizability can improve the way we learn together, if one really utilizes the new possibilities.   Microsofts Learning Gateway is a web portal solution to be used in schools. In this masters thesis the question if the Learning Gateway can support and extend collaborative learning is analyzed. To approach the question a combination of these methods is used extensive literature studies, competitive analysis, expert analysis cognitive walkthrough and enduser evaluations with students and teachers through questionnaires, interviews and observations. The customizability was evaluated through testing if developers at a municipal level manage to develop for the Learning Gateway. This was tested with help of different lab tasks using the developing tool Visual Studio 2005 and evaluation questionnaires.   The study shows that in general the Learning Gateway has the possibility to support and extend collaborative learning but that there are many problems that need to be solved before it works efficiently. For example the focus must move from supplying a document repository to supporting cooperation, communication, instruction and support  in other words learning. Concerning the customization there are also constraints, mostly regarding the too high threshold of learning for Visual Studio, even for users with good IT experience. Suggested actions on how to solve these problems and general recommendations are therefore given. Perhaps they can take the Learning Gateway closer to the customizable collaborative web portal it has potential to become.

In the last decade it has changed to a powerful communication medium suitable for collaborative educational activities. In addition to this, educational and business environments are becoming increasingly distributed, geographically and temporally. Work teams are often made up of people located at different sites, and experts are rarely present in the same location or at the same time. As a result, the use of collaboration technology is fast becoming a necessity in these organizations. The amount of commercial systems with a collaborative component has risen significantly over recent years Dix et al. 2004. Yet with the exception of a few systems, collaborative technologies are not widely used. One main reason for this is that these systems are complex and often have serious usability problems. The usability can have a large impact both on the overall efficiency and effectiveness of a team of information workers, and on the quality of the work that they do. Because of the widespread use of Internet, groupware has the potential to increase group productivity in the same way spreadsheets and word processors makes individuals more productive Stahl 2002. Humans are inherently social we live, work, play and learn together and therefore it seems natural to develop interactive systems that support and extend different kinds of sociality Preece et al. 2002.  SharePoint is Microsofts collaboration technology and it emerged from the idea to enable information workers to create personalized user interfaces by simply dragging and dropping plugandplay components. With SharePoint nonprogrammers should be able to bring together information of interest and customize its appearance. For example, in one location, they should be able to assemble a graph that shows sales for their division, a local traffic monitor, a stock ticker, a news feed focused on selected topics, and perhaps a calendar that shows their daily appointments. In its first incarnation, this vision was originally named the Digital Dashboard, and its first canvas was Microsoft Outlook. Eventually, the browser emerged as the preferred container for pluggable web parts, and the vision melded into the industrywide trend toward developing customizable Web portals Baron 2003.  There are two different Microsoft products called SharePoint. SharePoint Services  the Webbased team collaboration environment is the baselevel SharePoint product. SharePoint Portal Server builds on top of SharePoint Services and provides indexing and management tools for SharePointbased sites. According to Microsoft, SharePoint Portal Server can be used to implement an intelligent portal that connects users, teams and knowledge so that people can take advantage of relevant information and work more efficiently. Among other features SharePoint enables users to work together on projects, documents and meetings. But as for other collaborative technologies SharePoint is not used to that extent it could. Bill Gates said at the Office System Developer Conference that SharePoint is one of the most underutilized assets of the Office system Foley 2005.    1Introduction    The Learning Gateway is an implementation of SharePoint and is supposed to work as a customizable web portal to be used in schools. This masters project studies the Swedish version of the Learning Gateway, called Skolportalen. But since this report is in English it is referred to as Learning Gateway even though Skolportalen differs in some aspects from the actual Learning Gateway.   The Learning Gateway is essentially made to be a portal where students, teachers and parents can access a wide range of information sources gathered at the same place figure 1 shows a screenshot of the start page. It provides, for instance   a single point of access to information, documents and applications depending on who you are, teacher, student or administrator.  collaboration on projects, documents, meetings.  tools to share ideas and information.  document check incheck out, versioning.  shared calendars, discussions, surveys.  Figure 1. Screenshot of the start page of the Learning Gateway.   SharePoint was developed primarily to serve as a business application and the Learning Gateway was created out of it to fit a typical American school. But the Learning Gateway is now starting to spread amongst schools in Sweden. No previous research has been done on how it works in this setting, how usable it is and on how to design the best Swedish implementation of the Learning Gateway and therefore there is a call for a study on that from  2Introduction    Microsofts side. We have lots of ways to connect with people using technology, but there are countless opportunities to make them smarter and more efficient said Bill Gates Microsoft Prepass April 2005.   More and more often the importance of customization and individualization is mentioned in discussions about interactive media  to enable the users to adjust an interface to their specific requirements. Microsofts strategy is to develop products for a mass market and first when they get customized they become really powerful. A SharePoint portal enables customization and personalization of portal content and layout as part of the basic functionality. But for a portal to be worthy its name and to be fully usable it has to be possible to develop and add applications to it that suits, in this case, a particular schools needs. That is a fundamental requirement because what is useful for one school might be of no use for another.   Schools in general have tight budget though, so hiring expensive consultants for developing applications is not an option. Developing for the Learning Gateway therefore has to be possible for developers at municipal level or lower. To gain knowledge of this target groups capability to develop applications with Microsofts developing tool Visual Studio 2005 is therefore essential. Since Microsoft are convinced that systems that are easy to develop and easy to use are the most costeffective ones in both the short and the long run Microsoft Public 2004 research on the usability of the Learning Gateway and the possibilities to develop for it is of Microsofts interest.   The study on how the Learning Gateway can support and extend collaboration is concerned with the project group features in the portal. The focus is on six students in the ninth grade and their teachers at the school in Nacka municipality, outside Stockholm, and how these project group features can help them in the work on the final project in compulsory school. Administrators were not included in the studies since it was still not clear how the administration would be solved. The whole Nacka municipality is involved in a so called pilot project where the aim is to practically try out a temporary implementation of the Learning Gateway during a couple of months to see if the solution suits their needs. The screenshot above is from the pilot portal. During the autumn of 2005 Nacka municipality is going to decide if they will continue to use the portal or not. Nacka municipality wants to try a learning portal with cooperation spaces and tools for communication and information. They seek new ways of working and new procedures where the technique acts as support. Their requirements of the Learning Gateway are    It should be administrated Inhouse. It should be drifted and managed by Nacka municipality.   The layout should be customizable to suit different age groups.   The portal should display news, schedules and contain class workspaces.   Students should be able to create, change and save document in searchable, shared document storage spaces.  Parents should be able to log on and receive information.  3Introduction    1.2 AimProblems The aim of this thesis is to address these problems   Does the Learning Gateway support and extend collaboration between endusers teachers, students and eventually parents today How should a SharePoint implementation be designed to support collaboration The aim here is to create feasible designguidelines on how to implement the Learning Gateway so that it supports collaboration. These suggestions can, in the future, serve as guidelines on how to designimplement a SharePoint portal at a school, and be used by Microsofts partners who are the ones that will perform the actual implementation  For SharePoint to be usable in an educational environment it has to be customized to suit the schools specific requirements. But is SharePoint development usable for developers at a municipal level According to the general opinion at Microsoft Visual Studio has a low threshold of learning and makes beginners productive fast. This research will explore if the Learning Gateway is customizable through testing if developers at a municipal level find Visual Studio 2005 usable. If not, the aim is to create recommendations on how to change the situation.   1.3 Reading Directions Target group for this report is Microsoft and academics with a Master of Science degree or equivalent with an interest in this area Information Technology, CSCWCSCL and Groupware etc. The report can probably be useful for a wider group but while writing it I assumed that the reader is familiar with concepts and terms that Masters of Engineering and people at Microsoft normally are.   In the Theory chapter the field of collaborative technologies is presented with a focus on usability and design principles for these technologies. Readers with good knowledge about collaborative technologies can skip the theory chapter since it is basically a review of what science knows about this area. In Methodology and Implementation the methods I chose to approach the problems are explained. The reasons for choosing them are discussed as well as my own and others criticism towards the methods. Other possible methods are also considered here. The Result chapter is a summary of the most important information gathered with help of the methods. These results are analyzed and interpreted in the Analysis chapter. Here are also the questions posed in the beginning of the thesis discussed on the basis of the collected data presented in the result chapter. The questions are then answered as far as possible in Conclusions using the results and the analysis. The problems found and their solutions are summarized and the way the solutions can be implemented is described. The Recommendations chapter consists of my recommendations on suggested actions to Microsoft. In the Discussion chapter reflections on the methods and work process are found and the chapter ends with an exploration of the future potential of the Learning Gateway and suggestions on further research in this area.   4Theory    2 Theory In this chapter the frame of reference is presented as a review of the literature study that serves as a base for this thesis. Apart from introducing the research area of collaborative technologies the literature study aimed to find general design principles for groupware. The Learning Gateway is evaluated on the basis of these design principles in the Analysis chapter.   2.1 CSCW  ComputerSupported Collaborative Work The first computer network that allowed communication between separate machines was established in the 1960s. By this time the intention was to provide individuals with enough computing power. But when the workstations became more powerful people still wanted to be connected to other workstations. This was the emergence of collaboration between individuals via the computer  also called ComputerSupported Collaborative Work, or CSCW Dorohonceanu 2004.   The CSCW term was invented by Irene Greif Massachusetts Inst. of Technology and Paul Cashman Digital Equipment Corporation at the first workshop in the CSCW field, held at MIT in 1984. There is no unique definition of CSCW. Researchers in the field usually have their own definitions, which however are quite similar. A relatively broad definition by Bowers 1991 is In its most general form, CSCW examines the possibilities and effects of technological support in distributed collaborative group communication and work processes. Greif 1988 defines CSCW as computerassisted coordinated activity such as communication and problem solving carried out by a group of collaborating individuals. Brinck 1998 describes CSCW as the scientific discipline, which examines the design, adoption and use of applications for teamwork, but CSCW is also concerned with the study and theory of how people work together and how these applications affects team behavior.   CSCW is a multidisciplinary field, drawing concepts and techniques from a number of different disciplines computer scientists bring in their knowledge of networks, messaging services, and distributed systems. Social scientists contribute with their sociological and anthropological knowledge and psychologists, cognitive scientists and people from HumanComputer Interaction HCI collect the knowledge of human factors in computing Gross 1996. Other contributions come from ethnography, organizational theory, small group theory, composition theory, and economics Dorohonceanu 2004. As a comparison HCI can be seen as built upon psychology and computing, while CSCW is rather built upon sociology and computing. The two main aspects of CSCW are accordingly the aspect of group work and the aspect of technology. KTH has a long tradition of CSCW research, starting in the 1980s with the UTOPIA project Bdker 1987. In the project the Scandinavian IT Design Model for interaction design started to take shape, which is a model for cooperative design see also Bdker 2000.    5Theory    2.2 CSCL  ComputerSupported  Collaborative Learning As the name indicates, ComputerSupported Collaborative Work is concerned with the world of work, where people strive to accomplish commercial tasks. In the world of education, where students learn how to function effectively in the world of work, one rather refers to the field as ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning, CSCL Stahl 2002. Since the social contexts of CSCW and CSCL are very different it seems reasonable to treat them as two different domains. On the other hand, in todays knowledge society, work often requires learning Stahl 2002, which indicates that the domains are closely related. Accordingly CSCL and CSCW have many significant commonalities but also different requirements. For a generic CSCW platform to work in an educational setting, the functionality of it has to be adopted, transformed and refined. As CSCL it has to facilitate collaborative learning, knowledge building, perspective intertwining, knowledge negotiation, portfolio sharing and knowledge artifacts in active and structured virtual learning places Stahl 2002. Stahl also believes that CSCL has the potential to convert teacher centric learning into collaborative learning and change knowledge management into knowledge building.   Educational Theories Behaviorism with its simple stimuliresponse model was in the 1920s used to explain behavior. Applied on learning behaviorism resulted in a view on knowledge as a change in behavior leading to a specific response from a certain stimuli. After behaviorism followed cognitivism, introduced by American scholars in the 50s. According to this theory learning is an internal, creative process that happens when the mind processes information to form understanding. During the last decades constructivism has been the most widely accepted theory, and it is also the main standpoint in this thesis. It considers learning to be a social activity that involves collaboration and knowledge to be actively constructed by individuals while working together Hwang et al. 2002.   2.3 Groupware Definition Collaborative technologies are often called Groupware. While CSCW and CSCL refer to the research area, groupware is concerned with the technology the computer system that supports the group work. The dawn of groupware lead to a conceptual shift in viewing the relationship between humans and computers from the traditional computer paradigm that sees computers as tools for manipulating and exchanging data to the group paradigm that presents computers as shared spaces in which people collaborate Dorohonceanu 2004. There is no universal definition of groupware Ellis 1991 provides a good summarizing definition   Groupware is computerbased systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task or goal and that provide an interface to a shared environment.    6Theory    Under the most rigorous definition, a complete groupware infrastructure has three dimensions communication pushing or pulling information out into an organization, collaboration shared information and building shared understanding, and coordination of tasks. Although several technologies may be used in the collaboration process, groupware usually has a set of workstations networked together in some arrangement. Any application that is networked and allows individuals to share data may fall into the category of groupware. The World Wide Web itself can be considered as groupware in the weak sense of the word Dix 1996. However, in this thesis for example multiuser databases or servers are not labeled groupware even though some people mean that since servers are so crucial for the communication between computers they are by definition groupware. I consider groupware to be collaborative technology specifically made for supporting groups. To define a group I use Scheins definition 1965 A group is any number of people who interact with one another, are psychologically aware of one another and perceive themselves to be a group.  Collaborative applications include, but are not limited to communication applications, group calendars, resource schedulers, collaborative learning, joint editing of documents, interactive online sales, joint exploration of data and multiplayer interactive games. Examples of all of these exist, and new products are continually emerging Dorohonceanu 2004.   Why People Use Groupware The most common reasons why people use groupware are, according to Brinck 1998 to facilitate communication make it faster, clearer, more persuasive, to enable communication where it would not otherwise be possible, to enable telecommuting to work at home using a computer connected to the network of ones employer, to cut down on travel costs and to bring together multiple perspectives and expertise. But also to form groups with common interests where it would not be possible to gather a sufficient number of people facetoface, to save time and cost in coordinating group work and to facilitate group structured interactions.   Classification of Groupware  Classification is, together with definition, an essential prerequisite for evaluation because the classification helps to identify other applications that pose similar technical challenges and therefore can be compared to the application one evaluates. The fact that the term groupware is loosely defined has led to a number of different classification systems all originating from different researchers perspectives. This is one of the reasons why evaluating groupware is very difficult and challenging. Evaluating problems are discussed further later in the thesis.  Timespace classification Dix et al. 2004 has developed a classification system of groupware that depends on where and when the participants are performing the cooperative work. It is called the Timespace matrix see figure 2.     7Theory      Same place    Different places     Synchronous  Meeting rooms   Video conferences, video wall, etc.    Same time   Shared work surfaces and editors   Shared PCs and windows       Asynchronous  Argumentation tools    Email and electronic conferences     Different time   Coauthoring systems and shared calendars    Figure 2. Groupware in the timespace matrix Dix et al. 2004.    Asynchronous groupware is considered a more thoughtful, reflective mode for knowledge building while synchronous groupware can be much more timeefficient for intense interaction like brainstorming assuming that the participants can get together at the same time Dix et al. 2004. This matrix is common amongst the CSCW community but one can argue that it, for example with email, does not make any difference whether the users are operating at the same time or not. A better distinction between groupware might be to look at the data store. For example email systems and coauthoring systems differ from each other by the fact that most of the latter have a single shared database. A refined timespace matrix is shown in figure 3. It classifies systems as synchronized when there is a realtime computer connection or unsynchronized when there is none. Dix et al. 2004.    Colocated    Remote    Concurrent  Meeting rooms   Videoconferences, video wall, etc.   Synchronized  Shared work surfaces and editors Shared PCs and windows  Mixed  Coauthoring systems, shared calendars  Serial  Argumentation tools   Unsynchronized Email and structured messages, electronic conference   Figure 3. Groupware in the refined timespace matrix Dix et al. 2004.   8Theory    Functional classification  Functional classification of groupware is based on the entities involved in cooperative work the participants and the artifacts upon which they work. Groupware is therefore classified by the function, which they primarily support Of course a system can support several functions.   Computermediated communication, which supports direct communication between users.  Meeting and decision support systems that capture the common understanding.   Shared applications and artifacts supporting the users interaction with the artifacts of work.  Dix et al. 2004.   Shared information classification Apart from the refined timespace matrix and the functional classification Dix et al. 2004 proposed methods for groupware classification based on the granularity of sharing, the level of sharing and the type of shared objects. The granularity of sharing different groupware allow, regarding object chunk size and frequency of update, distinguishes groupware systems from each other. Example of high granularity Users can edit the same sentence in a shared document. Lower granularity A shared document library with lockingfunctionality. The granularity is here the sentence and the document. In the time dimension, finegrained chunks require finegrained updates since their users need to be constantly updated about the others changes. In other words, if you are allowed to edit the same word, it is not helpful if it takes a minute to see your colleagues typing Dix et al. 2004.  Groupware varies not only in terms of how much is shared, but also the level of sharing. Some systems share only output, for example the same view of a database. Other systems share both output and input, for example a shared virtual keyboard or multiple insertion points to a shared window system. Concerning the kind of objects that are shared, they, as expected, affect the cooperation. For example collaboration is different when sharing a complicated hypertext object compared to sharing a tiny text chunk.   Wengers classification system Wenger 2001 classifies groupware in eight categories derived from an empirical study of the market. The classification of the products is based on their primary intention.    Desktop of the knowledge worker  Online project spaces for team work  Website communities  Discussion groups  Synchronous meeting facilities  Communityoriented elearning systems  Access to expertise  Knowledge repositories   9Theory    In appendix A follows is a more detailed description of Wengers categories. Regarding the classification of Microsoft SharePoint Wenger says   Most systems today do not fall into one simple category but combine multiple tools into a platform. So SharePoint is probably primarily a file sharing system, but it includes some less developed interactive capabilities that make more appropriate as a platform for communities of practice. See appendix B for email correspondence with Wenger.  A community of practice is according to Wenger a group of professionals, informally bound to one another through exposure to a common class of problems, common pursuit of solutions, and thereby themselves embodying a store of knowledge. Wenger did not place SharePoint directly in any of the categories above but I consider it to be closest related to a Communityoriented elearning system, therefore Wengers 2001 description of the category follows  Communityoriented elearning systems These systems are designed specifically to support educational activities. They can emphasize a sense of community at varying degree according to their approach to teaching, ranging from virtual classrooms to more communitybased approaches. Typical features of this kind of product are storage of content material, open and directed ways for students to discuss content, support for synchronous or asynchronous content delivery, presentation facilities and recording and broadcasting of classroom sessions  Because of its empirical origins and relative recentness, I think Wengers groupware classification system best suits the purposes of this study.   Communication Models  Effective communication is the obvious basis in collaborative work Dix et al. 2004. In asynchronous, and in some cases in synchronous groupware, text is the main form of direct communication. The text based communication serves as a speech substitute in groupware. But since the style of writing and that of facetoface communication are very different there are some difficulties adjusting between the two media. Knowledge about the normal facetoface communication, which involves eyes, face and body, needs to be applied to textbased conversation. According to Dix et al 2004 text based conversation has reduced lowlevel feedback from for instance facial expressions, less context to disambiguate utterance because of lost feedback and often overlapping turns and slower pace of interaction, which compels higher granularity in their messages. There are four types of textual communication in current groupware   Discrete directed messages as in email. Except for references to previous emails there is no link between different messages.   Linear messages are presented in often temporal order.  Nonlinear messages are connected to each other in a hypertext style.   Spatial massages are arranged on a surface, for example a digital whiteboard.  Dix et al. p. 495   10Theory    2.4 Usability According to the ISO standard 912612001 software usability is the capability of a software product to be attractive to a user and understood, learned and used by herhim under specified conditions. The six main characteristics are functionality, reliability, efficiency, maintainability and portability. They are then divided into subcategories such as accuracy, security, fault tolerance, understandability, attractiveness, resource utilization, etc. Three areas that Kanerva et al. 2005 have found to be critical for usability are organization of the content, navigation aiming at fluid navigation, and engagement. User experience is often included in the usability concept and is a measure of how satisfying, enjoyable, fun, entertaining, helpful, motivating, aesthetically pleasing, supportive of creativity and rewarding a software application is.  In short, usability is the quality of a system that makes it easy to learn, easy to use, easy to remember, error tolerant, and subjectively pleasing. These factors influence how well the functionality of the application fits user needs, how well the flow through the application fits user tasks and how well the response of the application fits user expectations Dorohonceanu 2004. For a system to be useable it has to take into account the human system, the context and expected benefits. Usability is a quality concept that is first noticeable in usage Ottersten and Berndtsson 2002. Jakob Nielsen, often called a guru of web usability, has developed ten usability heuristics for user interface design that are so wellknown that they almost serve as a definition of usability. They are called heuristics because they are more in the nature of rules of thumb than specific usability guidelines. The heuristics are summarized below and are described in detail in appendix C.   Jakob Nielsens ten usability heuristics   Visibility of system status   Match between system and the real world   User control and freedom   Consistency and standards  Error prevention   Recognition rather than recall  Flexibility and efficiency of use   Aesthetic and minimalist design   Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors   Help and documentation   The usability goals are according to Preece et al. 2002   Effectiveness Is the system capable of allowing people to learn well, carry out their work efficiently and access the information they need    Efficiency Once users have learned how to use a system to carry out their tasks, can they sustain a high level of productivity   Safety Does the system prevent users from making serious errors and, if they do make an error, does it permit them to recover easily   11Theory     Utility Does the system provide an appropriate set of functions that enable users to carry out all their tasks in the way they want to do them   Learnability How easy is it and how long time does it take to get started using a system to perform core tasks and to learn how to do a wider set of tasks   Memorability What kind of interface has been provided to help users remember how to carry out tasks, especially for systems and operations that are used infrequently  Why is usability important  Traditionally usability has not been prioritized since it has been argued that the users will learn how the system works sooner or later if they have to. Admittedly it is true but to what cost Loss of time for learning, inefficiency in usage, stress and mistakes are all disadvantages that derive from low usability Ottersten, Berndtsson 2002.  Benefits from usability according to Ottersten and Berndtsson 2002 are increased productivity, less training time, reduced costs, engaged orderers and users, reduced life cycle costs, increased satisfaction for users and a stronger trademark  Usability is important for the management of an organization, the developer, and the user. For the user it can make the difference between enjoying and performing a task accurately and completely, and being frustrated and performing the task inaccurately andor incompletely. For developer it may be the difference between a successful system and failing system. Finally, for the management, software system with poor usability may reduce the workforce productivity to worse than without the system. In all cases, lack of usability may cost time and effort, and may greatly influence the success or failure of a system Dorohonceanu 2004.  2.5 Groupware Usability Groupware usability is the degree to which a groupware system supports the activities of collaboration  communication, coordination, planning, monitoring and assistance Greenberg et al.1999. Usability often refers only to single user usability, but since groupware is built to allow interaction between humans it has to meet the requirements of a group of people, not only the individual users. In groupware usability all the issues related to traditional user interface design remain relevant, since the technology still involves individuals. But groupware usability also involves understanding groups and how people behave in groups. It involves having a good understanding of networking technology and how aspects of that technology for instance, delays in synchronizing views affect a users experience. Designers also must have an understanding of the degree of homogeneity of users, of the possible roles people play in cooperative work and of who key decisionmakers are and what influences them Brinck 1998.   Brinck 1998 further declares that usability must be better for groupware than for singleuser systems because the pace of use of an application is often driven by the speed of a conversation and system responsiveness and reliability become more significant issues. Thus, groupware design has all the interface design challenges of single user applications,  12Theory    supplemented by a host of new challenges arising from its direct involvement in group processes Grudin 1994 and we can define groupware usability as the degree to which a system supports both singleuser usability and teamwork.   Why it is Difficult to Develop Good Groupware All the benefits of groupware come at a cost. Groupware software is significantly more difficult to develop than traditional software much because groupware systems are intrinsically more complicated than singleuser systems. Also there are many singleuser assumptions built into graphics toolkits. Buttons, dialog boxes, text and graphics regions are useful to create singleuser interfaces but are not as suitable for groupware. For example Popup dialog boxes blocks the application from monitoring the network. To cut, paste and copy text inside a document is very difficult when it is shared and the groupware may have to be designed round these limited capabilities Dix et al. 2004.  Even when groupware development despite the technical difficulties is done right, the system will not be successful unless most or all of the targeted users perceive a benefit and are willing to adopt it. This comes in contrast with singleuser systems that may be successful even when only a fraction of the targeted users adopts it. Grudin 1994 refer to this as the critical mass problems. A groupware system may fail because the critical mass of users required for it to be useful is not reached. For example, if only 10 people in the world had access to email, then email services would not be as successful as they are nowadays. For this reason, groupware developers try to avoid failed designs by studying and employing the usability of groupware Dorohonceanu 2004.  A high level of error handling, exception handling and improvisation characterizes human activities. This means that you cannot develop groupware with simple, standardized procedures for collaboration and without advanced error handling tools. Even though this thesis is focused on discussing groupware, single user applications integrated with the groupware are essential for the success of groupware. In teamwork the tasks are often divided between the group members and as a result the users work more frequently with applications supporting singleusers and more seldom with the groupware. Consequently groupware features must be easier to use or integrated in the singleuser systems in an unobtrusive way. If groupware is used for individual tasks it will soon become familiar and thus easier to use Stahl 2002.   Finally, in groupware there is also a risk to violate social taboos. For example secretaries know that managers unscheduled time is seldom really free. Unauthorized scheduling of a managers apparently open time can lead to rejection of automatic meeting scheduling systems Grudin 1994.   Groupware Design Principles The aim of this chapter is to define what characterizes good and usable groupware and to describe how to design groupware that support teamwork  the work of working together. This is done through presenting different theories about groupware design.   Greenberg et al. 1999 claimed that existing usability heuristics could identify problems in task work, but did not say anything about teamwork. Therefore they developed five  13Theory    groupware usability heuristics. All groupware applications do not have to support all heuristics. Rather, the heuristics point to aspects that might be useful in a total collaborative work context, depending on the specific shared task needs.   Greenberg et al.s 1999 five groupware usability heuristics  Provide centers locales that collect people, artifacts and resources in relation to the central purpose of the social world. A locale provides the site, means and resources for a group to pursue team and task work. Locales should be dynamic so they can evolve along with the people, the artifacts, and the purposes that define them.   Provide awareness mutuality within locales that helps people maintain a sense of shared place and that keeps them informed about shared activity. Mutuality includes one persons awareness of others, the artifacts comprising the locale, where things are located, and how things are changing    Allow individual views so one can view a locale or aggregate multiple locales as they relate to ones responsibilities, activities, and interests. A particular person should be able to view locales from his or her particular perspective and in a way that reflects their degree of focus and participation.   Allow people to manage and stay aware of their evolving interactions over time. This includes a groups control over past, present and future aspects of routine and nonroutine work how people coordinate and negotiate plans and activities over time, how people leverage past experiences, how breakdowns are noticed and repaired, and how processes are supported.   Provide a way to organize and relate locales to one another civic structures. Locales are rarely independent of one another people need a way to structure the locales in a meaningful way, to find their way between locales, to create new locales, and to remove old ones.  According to the Wenger 2001, typical features useful to a community of practice see Wengers classification system for definition would be  A homepage to communicate its existence and activities  A conversation space to discuss topics related to its domain  An area for floating questions within the community  A directory of members expertise in the domain  A shared workspace for eventual synchronous collaboration or meetings  A document repository for their knowledge base  A search engine to retrieve what they need in their knowledge base  Community management tools to monitor members activity and documents status  A function allowing the creation of sub communities   14Theory    Below follows a summary of groupware design principles found in several different articles and books concerning groupware. This list should not be seen as complete and many principles are of course applicable for single user applications too.  User needs Most groupware systems fail to support collaborative activities due to a mismatch between the designers figure of the users needs and the users needs in the groupwares actual context Grudin 1994. Therefore a design principle when developing groupware is to carefully consider how the whole group of users will use the system. Groupware should be designed to take into account both individual needs and preferences but also the needs of the group. Additionally the demand for groupware must of course come from the group of users and not from for example a manager Cole 1995.   Functionality If a groupware system supports several of the functions that Dix et al. 2004 presents direct communication, the capture of common understanding and the interaction with shared artifacts and applications it can be considered to be good groupware. A groupware system does not have to support every aspect of communication and shared work, but it should be open to supporting cooperative work as a whole.  Group working Groupware should in general be designed so that new members can enter the group. For example a latecomer to a synchronous conference should be able to review all past contributions, not just the new ones. A groupware system should support various sizes of groups, from individual level to large size groups, with fluid navigation and transfer of contents among the levels.   Heterogeneity  In many cases, regardless of the collaboration topics or tasks, view heterogeneity is present due to user preferences, available hardware or software, or collaboration topics. The view heterogeneity may manifest in either the application sharing or collaboration management and it is therefore important to support heterogeneous views during collaboration Dorohonceanu 2004. Obviously groupware should also be platform independent to be usable for as many users as possible. In other words, groupware should be able to work with more than one hardwareplatform or operating system.   Hidden complexity and modularity Since groupware is more technically complex than single user applications it is essential that most of the high complexity of multiuser interface implementations is hidden from the users. Interface modularity is also a good general design principle that should be applied when designing the interface, i.e., the interface components should be considered as individual modules. A modular approach supports programming reusable and easy to maintain modules. Dorohonceanu 2004.   15Theory    Single signin Login difficulties mainly due to multiple signin requirements account for the secondlargest difference in employee productivity between intranets with good usability and those with poor usability, according to Nielsens 2005 intranet usability measurements. Search usability constituted the biggest difference between good and bad intranets. Intranets are in many cases equivalent with groupware.  Feedback Feedback is the response of the interface to the enduser. For synchronous groupware, feedback delays must be under certain limits otherwise the interaction with the application may become unacceptable slow for the user. For example, any delay greater than a fraction of a second between typing and appearance of characters on the display is intolerable when editing text. Drawing demands even faster response than writing Dix et al. 2004.   Intuitive navigation  Users seldom read documentation or use online help and therefore groupware need to be intuitive. Intuitive navigation is a vague concept but should be interpreted as navigation that feels natural and has correspondence to how things work in the real world. Whether or not the navigation is intuitive is of course not only a matter of interaction design, it is also, for example, culturally and socially dependent. Additionally common tasks should be placed high in the information structure Ottersten, Berndtsson 2002.  Flexibility Many groupware systems are too inflexible in their way of communicating with the users, for example discussionnotes on a document might have to be labeled as opinion, argument or question Preece et al. 2002. Studies of groupware have found that roles for example coauthor and commentator in a coauthoring system change which means that the groupware systems must allow these roles to change during collaboration. Dix et al. 2004  TailoringCustomization There is a growing recognition that more customizable systems are needed to allow for the variation between groups and within the same group over time. Groupware often do not provide or expose desired features while providing and exposing unnecessary ones. This is because all users are different and have different requirements. A possible solution to this problem is tailoring.   Tailoring is the activity of modifying a computer application within the context of its use. It is therefore distinguished from both use and development, but it borrows terminology from each. Tailoring is development of an application during use to adjust it to needs that was not taken into account in the original design see figure 4. Tailorability is widely assumed to be a key requirement for the design of groupware systems, due to rapidly changing work situations Mrch et al.1997.    16Theory     Work situation Tailoring Application Design mismatch            Figure 4. Tailoring Mrch et al. 1997.    Tailoring can involve various levels of an application, ranging from changing some parameters and switches to changing its source code Mrch et al., 1997. Often tailoring takes the form of modules or features that can be added to or removed from the system by its administrator or final users. Dorohonceanu 2004 also emphasizes the need of customization and argues that a groupware systems architecture should allow the users to customize their data views and the interaction with them. Cole 1995 focuses on communication and states that finding ways to incorporate a variety of personal communication styles is critical if the technology intends to support communication for the entire group.   Userinitiated tailoring, often called adaptability, refers to the users ability to adjust the shape of input and output. The adaptability can range from only allowing adjustments of the positions of soft buttons to programming language capabilities, such as the UNIX shell Dix et al. 2004. The modification that a groupware system automatically would make based on its knowledge of the user is referred to as adaptivity. It can be based on user expertise or observed repetition of certain task sequences Dix et al. 2004.   Designers often rely on their intuition when deciding how to represent the shared information and how to support user interaction with the presentation of information. As shown in Gross 1996, these decisions are then prematurely committed by embedding the presentation and interaction details of the multiuser interface in the source code of the system itself, therefore inhibiting user interface tailoring.  CSCLspecific Design Principles CSCW  ComputerSupported Collaborative Work can be seen as archiving and sharing of existing knowledge artifacts  knowledge management. CSCL ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning, on the other hand should support the functioning of a collaborative group so as to build knowledge that is the shared creation and property of the group Stahl 2002. CSCL strives to support the synergistic construction of knowledge at the group level that is quite distinct from what any of the students could produce on their own. The idea of collaborative knowledge building is that new knowledge is created through the investigations and discourse of a group. Of course there is room for individual student thinking and teacher guidance but also for sharing, critiquing and building upon each others ideas to arrive at deeper knowledge. According to Stahl 2002 CSCL should support   17Theory      The collaborative reflection on information sharing and annotating.  The building of group knowledge discussion from perspective.  The determination of what is to count as produced knowledge artifacts knowledge negotiation.   Since a CSCLgroupware should function in an educational environment it is important that it is structured in a way that is natural for the students and teachers using them, for example structure the information around courses and projects. A CSCL system should have functionality to set up access rights for different folders and in that way let the users have different roles with different rights.   It is often useful for groups to discuss how the concepts they are working with are related to each other Stahl 2002, therefore applications like a shared whiteboard are preferable. And as said above, flexibility is crucial. CSCL must be flexible enough so that different schools with diverse needs can alter it to suit their specific educational approach.   The communications researcher Mats Heide 2002 means that a fundamental problem in the debate about learning and information and communication technology is that information and knowledge often is mixed up. He refers to research that shows that many information systems fail because knowledge is often separated from the humans that create and use it and that it is assumed that transfer of knowledge between individuals is uncomplicated. Further he argues that the standards shaped by the elearning business in most cases are made for another context and culture than the Swedish school. For example the standards are based on a belief that the students knowledge can be diagnosed automatically and that knowledge can be separated from its social context, which is not a common belief amongst Swedish teachers.   Apart from this, Heide recommends that schools should ask themselves Shall the CSCL system contain tools to facilitate the teachers administrative work Or should it first and foremost satisfy the students and teachers need of publication, cooperation, communication, instruction and support  in other words learning in a general sense And should the teachers and students stand for the content or should external actors deliver the greater part  Design Principles Specific for Synchronous Groupware  Regarding synchronous groupware CSCW researchers have identified design principles that software should follow in order to support user interaction. The design principles can also be seen as types of information that are needed for the support of collaboration. The most important are groupware awareness, task and view coupling and application sharing. Dorohonceanu 2004  Groupware Awareness Awareness is an important issue in groupware and means generally having some feeling for what other people are doing or have been doing Dix et al. 2004. It includes information about events, locations, shared artifacts, the other persons they are cooperating with, their past, present and futures actions or intentions, and so forth Dorohonceanu 2004. In other  18Theory    words, users need to be well informed to cooperate efficient and effective. There are different kinds of awareness Who is there What has happened with the shared objects And howwhy did it happen Dix et al. 2004.   Gutwin et al. 1996 identify four nondisjunctive and also not unique types of group awareness that are important for collaboration in groupware systems informal, social better called availability, groupstructural, and workspace awareness. Not all of them may be available at any moment in time and neither may they be required continuously. The different types of awareness are selfexplanatory except for maybe groupstructural awareness and workspace awareness and therefore they are explained below. Groupstructural awareness informs users about the group organization and norms, the reason for collaboration and the sharing of the knowledge, as well as the group members roles, responsibilities, the status, and the positions on certain issues. When this type of information becomes complex, supporting it in groupware systems becomes essential for both colocated and remote collaboration. Workspace awareness provides users with information about other participants interactions with the shared workspace and the artifacts it contains.  Awareness information is easily gathered when individuals are in a close proximity to each other. But if the users are in different places at different times they need technological support to achieve the awarenesslevel needed to cooperate. Thus before building a groupware system designers must consider exactly what types of awareness are relevant and whether or not they can be technically supported.   Task and view coupling With increasing task or view separation the granularity of the awareness information increases. Closely collaborating individuals, who have a shared view on an object they manipulate collaboratively, have very specific awareness needs for the object and its changes, but also for the identity and location of the other actors. Individuals with different tasks or different views would rather be disturbed by too detailed awareness information because they need only information about the presence, location, and intentions of other users.   Application sharing  Groupware should provide application sharing, which is when a group of users simultaneously interacts with one or more program and the users can all see the results of the interaction e.g., broadcasting of graphics, mouse movements, and edits to all participants. This creates a common context where shared information is displayed on multiple screens and manipulated by multiple endusers Dorohonceanu 2004. Usually the common interface in application sharing is coordinated by a session management system that provides the participants with communication channels, such as audio, video, text chat, and other collaboration widgets like telepointers, radar views, notes, or ticker tapes. In a singleuser application the application is given a stream of inputs from a single user. But groupware applications receive simultaneous inputs from several different users and that may cause conflicts during collaboration. In order to preserve the state consistency, the groupware system must resolve such conflicts.    19Methodology and Implementation    3 Methodology  Implementation  In this chapter I first explain the methods I chose to approach the problems and why I chose the. Then I present my own and others criticism towards the methods. Other possible methods are also discussed. The information gathered with help of the methods is presented in the Result chapter.  3.1 Method Overview To approach the problems, I chose to use a combination of these methods literature study, competitive analysis, expert analysis, enduser evaluation with students and teachers and developer evaluation. A flowchart showing the methods and how they relate chronologically or logically to each other and the aims is shown in figure 5.                                  AIM METHOD Summary of General Design Principles for Groupware Expert Analysis Enduser Evaluation  StudentsDeveloper Evaluation Enduser Evaluation  TeachersLiterature Study Competitive Evaluation Design Guidelines for Future Implemen tations of the Learning Gateway Answer to the question whether the Learning Gateway is customizable or not  Figure 5. Flowchart illustrating the different methods used.  20Methodology and Implementation    3.2 Literature Study The aim of the literature study was to cover previous research on collaborative technologies, to understand the background and theory and to learn more about methodology. More specifically the aim was to find established design principles for groupware, to serve as a base when I started to outline my own collection of groupware design guidelines. The literature study covered a much broader area than collaborative technologies to get an overall picture of the area and academic literature was the main source. In the literature study a combination of HCI books, articles, websites, reports and dissertations was used. In my search for literature and information I focused on CSCWCSCL and groupware, and not on elearning, LMS Learning Management Systems etc, which are closely related to the topic. Consequently the theory chapter might not cover some aspects of collaborative technologies. This was necessary though since the amount of available information about this area is so vast and my time was very limited. The theory chapter is a result of the literature study.  Since groupware is a relatively new research area I primarily searched for articles on the Internet where I believed I could find the most uptodate information. Some sources are rather dated though but from them I tried to only use relatively general and unchanging theories. Literature studies are essential but since literature is secondary data data not primarily intended for this study, they have to be combined with other methods, like interviews, that give primary data data collected specifically for this study.  3.3 Competitive Evaluation A competitive evaluation gives an idea about the general direction the market is moving in and where the next technological developments are coming from. It also shows what other similar systems have to offer. To determine which the similar systems were I used the classification theories described in the theory chapter. The framework for the evaluation followed Microsoft Engineering Excellence, which is the Microsoft standard for surveys on competitors.   SharePoint Portal Server could be classified as the minimum requirement for the Learning Gateway. A Learning Gateway can include other products such as Class Server, Exchange Server and Live Communication Server but the school in this research has only implemented SharePoint and that is why this competitive evaluation is based on SharePoint only. Many of the competitors have features in their portals that can be added to the Learning Gateway with Class Server, Exchange Server and LC Server and those features are not included in this comparison. The basis of this evaluation is therefore the features in SharePoint.   The information that this competitive evaluation is based on comes primarily from the Swedish National Agency for School Improvement 2004 and the products homepages. Consequently there is a risk some features of certain products are missing.   3.4 Expert Analysis Cognitive Walkthrough The method used in the expert analysis was cognitive walkthrough as described in for example Dix et al. 2004. The origin of the cognitive walkthrough is the code walkthrough known from software engineering. Walkthroughs involve a detailed review of the steps that an interface will require a user to perform in order to accomplish some  21Methodology and Implementation    known task. The evaluators step through that action sequence to check it for potential usability problems. I choose this method because it is widely used in usability testing in the industry, at universities and also at Microsoft.   To do a cognitive walkthrough you need   An indication of who the users are and what kind of experience and knowledge the evaluators can assume about the users.   A prototype or a complete system.  A description of a representative task the user is to perform on the system.   A complete list of the actions needed to complete the task with the proposed system.   For each action, the evaluator tries to answer the following four questions  Is the effect of the action the same as the users goal at that point  Will the users see that the action is available This does not mean recognition, only to see if submenus etc are visible.  Once users have found the correct action, will they know it is the one they need This is recognition, the meaning and effect is clear.  After the action is taken, will the user understand the feedback they get Will shehe know that the task is completed  The expert analysis in this study is done on the Leaning Gateway pilot a trial version of the Learning Gateway in Nacka municipality and more specifically on the Project site set up for the final project for six students in the ninth grade at a school in Nacka. The analysis was done by Kristina Groth, PhD in Computer Science with help from the author. Focus was on the collaborative aspects of the Learning Gateway and consisted of five tasks specific for students and two tasks specific for teachers. The tasks were created by the author and can be found in appendix E. After the evaluation a brief semi structured interview was conducted.  3.5 Enduser Evaluation  Usability Testing, Questionnaires and Interviews The endusers of Learning Gateway in this study were students and teachers. The Learning Gateway has potential to also engage parents but it showed that the school I limited my study to, had not included any functions for them yet, so parents were not involved in this study. The Learning Gateway is installed at several schools around Sweden but my user studies only involve the school in Nacka. The focus is on collaboration and groupware usability so single user usability is only briefly explored.   The aim of this evaluation was to test the usability of the collaborative functions in the Learning Gateway. Usability testing includes a range of methods for having users try out a system. In a typical usability test, users perform a variety of tasks with a prototype or a system while observers record notes on what each user does and says. According to Dorohonceanu 2004, a typical usability test is conducted with one user at a time or two users working together. Testing may include collecting data on the paths users take to do tasks, the errors they make, when and where they are confused or frustrated, how fast they do a task, whether they succeed in doing the task, and how satisfied they are with the experience.    22Methodology and Implementation    The use of questionnaires means a good and inexpensive way to achieve structured, often numeric and easily analyzed information. But in general it is difficult to design a good questionnaire so Jan Trosts 1994 guidelines for questionnaires was used. According to his guidelines only one question per question was asked, normal language was used, negations were avoided, consequent and short formulations were used, and emotive words were avoided. He also recommended placing questions about background in the end because they are boring to answer, but that felt unnatural that guideline was discarded. Several persons read through my questionnaires to find for example ambiguities in the questions. To limit the number of questions no questions that measured the same thing were asked, which made it in impossible to measure the congruence, in other words the similarity between questions that measure the same thing. Questionnaires should always be accompanied by a cover letter and Trosts guidelines regarding them were followed Keep the letter short but always include sender, name of the survey, how the result will be used, a promise about anonymity, name of and telephone number to the person the respondents can call if they have any questions.   Interviews are often more complicated and expensive than questionnaires since they require more contact with the respondent. At the same time the answering frequency is much higher since one seldom cancels a planned interview. Besides this the respondents are more likely to tell the truth in interviews compared to questionnaires since lies are more easily revealed in interviews. Compared to questionnaires, an advantage is also that it is possible to handle misunderstandings and ask followup questions directly. In my case the questionnaires were handed out and completed in my presence, and as a result I could overcome that problem with questionnaires. In general, interviews go deeper than questionnaires, but questionnaires can serve as a good basis for interviews. A semistructured interview technique was used, with prepared but changeable questions. Neutrality was strived for during the interviews, even though being entirely neutral is not possible.   Usually studies and surveys are classified as either qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative studies are characterized by an aim to gain a deeper understanding and to also study the problems context. High level of structure, control and selectivity on the other hand distinguishes quantitative studies. Statistical surveys are an example of quantitative studies. In this masters project I have applied a qualitative method, since the goal has been to gain understanding, rather than to get exact numbers of how things relate to each other. I am aware that I could have gone deeper in the study though.   The number of participants in my usability studies was quite low seven developers, three students and one interviewed teacher plus his collection of opinions from several other teachers because of limited time and availability. Time is on the other hand always a limited. According to Nielsen 2000 however, it is sufficient with only five evaluators. With five participants you find most of the usability problems and three is the minimum, see figure 6. But of course it is always better to test only one compared to none.    23Methodology and Implementation      Figure 6. The proportion of usability problems that can be found through usability testing with different numbers of participants Nielsen 2000.  Student Evaluation The student evaluation took place at the students school and started with a presentation of the study and myself for the students and their teacher who wanted to attend. I described why I was doing this study, the agenda and I also asked about permission to record the evaluation with a video camera. Additionally I made it clear that I was not responsible for the development of the Learning Gateway and that they could feel free to criticize it without me being offended. They were also informed that this was not a test to see how well they managed to perform the tasks. I rather wanted to see if the Learning Gateway is usable and suits their needs.   To begin with I handed out background questionnaires to outline the students age, computer skills and familiarity with the Learning Gateway. It was followed by a pre test group discussionsemi structured interview that aimed to give a better understanding of the context and how they work today. After that I conducted a scenario based usability test with one student at a time. Each scenario was written on a separate paper and the students were encouraged to think aloud during the time they performed the tasks. In the meantime the other students were asked to use the Learning Gateway in an exploratory way and continuously fill out their Best and Worst forms. In other words to report what about the Learning Gateway they like best and what they think is negative with it. At this stage of the evaluation the students had at least been introduced to the basic functionality in the Learning Gateway and could therefore participate in the usability test despite their eventual previous unfamiliarity with the Learning Gateway. After the usability test I performed a posttest questionnaire. The answers from the posttest questionnaire was used in the following second interview.  The scenarios and questions are found translated from Swedish in Appendix F.    24Methodology and Implementation    Teacher Evaluation One of the teachers at the school studied was very engaged in the testing of the pilot version of Learning Gateway so he helped out with collecting the teachers opinions of the Learning Gateway through interviews and emails posted to him about the Learning Gateway. I also performed a 1.5h long interview with him. The basis of the discussioninterview is found in Appendix G.   3.6 Developer Evaluation Lab Task and Questionnaires  The developer evaluation consisted of a lab task in Swedish with pre and posttest questionnaires. I created the lab out from an existing English one that I altered. The reason for not creating a brand new lab myself was that the developing tool I was about to test Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 was not released until several months after I started this masters project. And when it was released there were no tutorials or equivalent, which I, as a rather inexperienced Visual Studio developer, would have needed to find and learn the new functions. Only the lab that I used in my testing was available as far as I and my colleges at Microsoft Sweden could see and appropriate for what I was testing. The pre and post task questionnaires were designed according to the guidelines presented in the Enduser evaluation chapter.  In this study the definition of a developer is a person fulltime employed by the municipality that spends at least 25 of his or her time on software development. This person would also be the one operating an eventual Learning Gateway. Development of applications so called web parts for the Learning Gateway can be done in many ways but here, only Visual Studio 2005 is tested. The reason for this is that this masters project was done at Microsoft and Visual Studio 2005 was just about to be released by the time of my project. Naturally this means that the results from the test are only valid for Visual Studio and solely gives an idea of the customizability of the Learning Gateway. The reason why the lab was done with a beta version is that the final version was not released. The beta was a second beta though, which means functionality was almost like in the final version.   Microsoft Visual Studio is a set of development tools for building ASP.NET Web applications, XML Web services, desktop applications, and mobile applications. Visual Basic, Visual C, Visual C, and Visual J all use the same integrated development environment IDE, which allows them to share tools and facilitates in the creation of mixedlanguage solutions MSDN Library 2005.  To find developers that fulfilled the requirements, Microsoft Publics contacts and search for developers on the Internet was used. 25 developers were initially contacted via email. The first email contained a short description of the study and information about the reward a free sample of Visual Studio 2005 when it is released during the autumn 2005 see Appendix H for the whole email. Several developers replied and after sorting out the ones that did not suit the requirements, seven developers remained. This was enough though to do usability testing according to the graph above. The developers were sent a CD with Visual Studio 2005 Beta 2 so that they could install the program on their computers. The lab with an introductory letter appendix I and a posttest questionnaire appendix J were sent via email. Attached were also the files needed for the lab and extra information documents for the interested. The developers got two weeks to finish the task and by the end of that time I had received five evaluations that were analyzed  25Methodology and Implementation    see the result chapter. One developer did not manage to complete the lab because of technical problems and the other one did not have the time for the lab in the end.   3.7 Method Criticism and Other Possible Methods A problematic aspect of groupware evaluation is that groupware is still not supported by any established evaluation methodologies. Labexperiments are more difficult to control and record compared to experiments on single user applications and they cannot imitate social and motivational dynamics of a group. Field studies must take into account the social situation, and the number of people and different sites involved complicates the studies Dix et al. 2004. This complexity has resulted in the wide variety of techniques applied nowadays to evaluate groupware systems. Both scientific, engineering and social science methodologies are being used, and there seems to be no agreement regarding which one has to be applied in a certain circumstance Pinelle and Gutwin, 2000.  In the expert analysis I could have chosen other methods than a cognitive walkthrough, for example heuristic or model based evaluation. Heuristic evaluation is a method for structuring the critique of a system using a set of relatively simple and general usability heuristics rules of thumb. Like cognitive walkthrough, heuristic evaluation is a common method for expert analysis. But the heuristics created originally by Nielsen focus on interactions of a single user. All the problems found will therefore derive from individual tasks only and there will still be collaboration aspects to test. When evaluating groupware, we are more interested in the applications support for collaborative behavior, but there are no established methods to test this, which is why I choose not to use heuristic evaluation. Also, the rules for heuristic evaluation are often criticized to be too generally applicable, i.e. they can be interpreted too widely, and that the method demands too many evaluators to be cost efficient. Modelbased evaluation is another expertbased approach that combines design specification and evaluation into the same framework. Models include GOMS Goals, Operators, Methods and Selection and the low level keystrokelevel. Since my project did not include design specification this method did not seem appropriate. All expert analyses, including cognitive walkthrough, are limited however since even experienced experts find it problematic to know how typical users will behave. Consequently they are never completely reliable.   Apart from the many positive aspects of questionnaires they are quite unsophisticated, limited and the method is inflexible for gathering information. Thats why I combined them with interviews in the enduser evaluation. Contextual inquiry aims at understanding the users work context, because many times, the environment in which people work really influences how people use a product. Unfortunately there was not enough time for a contextual inquiry but to compensate this I held the interviews in the students and teachers real work environment, to study physical arrangements and environmental concerns. Furthermore I tried to open up a dialogue to reveal the users opinions, experiences and motivations even though I had prepared questions.   A research method practiced by for example Microsofts Usability Group is the use of Probes, for example Userdiaries. User diaries the probes are given to a group of users who are told to keep a diary for a certain time and write down their experiences from the interaction with the artifact one wants to test. This method would also have been used if there had been time because it collects information relatively immediately compared to interviews, where you talk about the past. A problem with this method is that many users consider it to be too time consuming to keep diaries though. Additionally the material achieved can be so extensive that it is hard to grasp, although a rich material can be desirable of course.   26Methodology and Implementation     Another possible method would have been to create personas Cooper 1999. Personas are archetypal users that represent the needs of larger groups of users, in terms of their goals and personal characteristics. They act as standins for real users and help guide decisions about functionality and design. The method is most usable in the early stages of the design process though, and is not a typical evaluation tool, which is why I did not choose to use it.   A limitation characterizing usability tests is that they usually focus on firsttime usage, and have a limited coverage of the interface features Shneiderman, 1998. Therefore, it is difficult for them to verify how a system will perform after a certain period of regular use. At the same time one can argue that firsttime usage is the most important aspect since it shows how intuitive the system is. All information obtained from what the users say or write is of course a bit unreliable since the users often tell what they think that the interviewer wants or expects to hear. Furthermore, the information is described after the event and is postrationalized Jones et al. 2004. Therefore data logging would be a good and reliable complement. Data logging involves recording usage of and interactions with a system to identify if users demonstrate an understanding of it. Large amounts of data are gathered and are often analyzed statistically, although several visualization techniques have been developed. Logging lacks information about the wider context though and thus gives no indication of the persons activities and whether these activities are successful Jones et al. 2004. For my project, this was a too technically complicated method to use.   Developing for the Learning Gateway can be done with several different developing tools, not only Visual Studio that I tested. Therefore my study will only give an indication on whether it is customizable or not though.    3.8 Reliability and Validity  Reliability measures to what extent a method gives the same result on a different occasion, providing the other circumstances are the same Bell 2000. In interviews high reliability is obtained through standardized and structured interviews and good documentation. I used a semi structured interview technique, which can lower the reliability, but on the other hand I also used structured questionnaires and recorded all interviews and observations with a video camera. Validity indicates to what extent a question measures what it is supposed to measure Bell 2000. The interview questions and the questionnaires were reviewed thoroughly by different persons to increase the validity of my study. High validity means ability to draw general conclusions from the results. In qualitative studies, like I did, it is not possible to directly generalize the result since it is not statistically secured.  27Results    4 Results This chapter is a summary of the most important information gathered with help of the methods presented above.   4.1 Results from the Competitive Evaluation The competitive evaluation showed that Blackboard, Classfronter, Luvit, First Class and Dot.LRN were the main competitors when it comes to features which is the only thing compared here. Figure 7 shows a part of the competitive evaluation spreadsheet and appendix D shows the whole evaluation. Features like discussion boards, personal sites, search functionality and document libraries were offered by almost every competitor. But only SharePoint offered meeting workspaces and singlesign on, as far as I could see. Many competitors carefully pointed out that they now had version handling, and browser based customization, which indicates that the trends could be moving that way. Features that are missing in the Learning Gateway I studied are shared calendars which probably can be added though, courses I take, my grades and workflow. Workflow activities provide users with the ability to route content to others for review or approval, designating settings such as priority, deadline, and permissions.       Figure 7. A part of the competitive evaluation spreadsheet found in appendix D.    28Results    4.2 Results from the Expert Analysis The results from the expert analysis include a list of the interface problems found and recommendations on how they can be solved. The problems are divided into three groups Severe Problems, General Measures and Details. Even though the evaluation focused on the project space, most recommendations can most likely be applied to other parts of the portal. All references to graphical elements in the text below are written in italic, like for example Material.  Severe Problems Navigation Problem It is in general difficult to navigate on the Project site. Users easily get lost. One reason for this is the constantly changing left margin. How to go back is also not intuitive, there is a button named Startsida Home but it is placed in the top menu list that is mostly used by the administrators, not by the ordinary users. In the upper right corner there is a button called Up to the level above  here Project groups but the placement and the name do not make it intuitive. Furthermore it is complicated to know what menus that correspond to the task you are doing. For example, if you click on Material there are three menus One on the top, one just below it and another one to the left see figure 8.     Figure 8. Screenshot from the Project site in the Learning Gateway and the three different menus.  Recommendation Follow wellaccepted webnavigation principles and let the left margin stay constant always display the same menu items and by that way serve as the main navigation menu. Certainly this menu can be expanded in different ways to show more  29Results    options like in figure 9. If the left margin is constant it can be used instead of back combined with the back button in the browser. Note that this problem is primarily the SharePoint developing teams task to take care of.     Figure 9. Example of an expandable menu.   Visibility Problem Many actions that are not intended for students are visible and possible to perform as far as to the last step, for example the button to add a new event in the project planner. This makes the interface full of irrelevant text and links, which in turn makes the important information relatively less visible. Recommendation Actions that are available only for one user group should not be visible for the other user groups. If an action is available for a specific user group, but just not at the moment it should be marked gray according to platform conventions.   General Measures  Consistency and Standards Problem Save and close and OK buttons have more or less the same outcome when clicking but all the OKs are placed at the bottom of the pages and the save and close buttons are placed on the top of the pages, which is inconsistent. Recommendation All SaveCloseOK buttons should be placed in reading direction, in other words at the bottom of the page.   Problem Identical functions do not have the same name. For example, the shortcut button under Material Lgg till dokument Add document opens the page Material verfr document Upload document. Under material there is a button called verfr document Upload document that leads you to the same page. See figure 10. Additionally there is another button under Material that says New Document, which can be seen as confusingly similar to adding a document. New document opens a template for a word document that can be saved directly into the Material library. Recommendation Similar actions should be called the same thing to reduce confusion and increase productivity. Only use Lgg till nytt dokument when referring to uploading.   Problem Drag and drop does not work with for example adding documents to a document library like Material. Recommendation Drag and drop can facilitate efficient workflow and may therefore be enabled.  30Results             Figure 10. Same actions with different names. Transfer document and Add document leads to the same page.   Compatibility  Problem The Project site is not compatible to the browser Safari or Mac OS without nonpleasing changes in text flow and font sizes. With Mac OS the drop down menus on the Project site do not work and that changes the way the user interacts with the page. This might not be an issue for SharePoint portals at most companies, where the IT environment normally is quite homogenous. But in school settings, and especially when the Project site is supposed to be used from home, this incompatibility is not acceptable. Recommendation Make the Project site compatible with the most common alternatives to the browser Internet Explorer and compatible to Mac OS.    Error prevention and Help Problem When you add updated files to a document library there is no dialog box asking if you want to replace the existing file, it is replaced automatically. Recommendation Use dialog boxes to double check before replacing. However, this project site has version handling so a document is not really replaced, it is only saved as an earlier version. But since the users do not necessarily know that, they should be warned or informed.    31Results    Problem When you choose Edit in Microsoft Word the document is not checked out automatically. Recommendation Documents should be checked out to prevent sharing violation.   Problem There is only a general help function independent on where you are at the site. Recommendation Make the help specific for the current page or function to increase efficiency in the problem solving.   Details  Problem Site organization. The expression Material is very broad and for example Links can be seen as material. The material under Material consists only of student documents except for one file with information about the project. Recommendation Change the title Material to Students Documents and save Links as it is. Move the document with project information up to the top, close to the rest of the project information. The students probably have several documents each that could be useful to upload to Material. To maintain a good overview by then the list should be organized in folders, one per student.   Problem There should be some indication that clicking on Projektplanering Project planning results in a calendar view. Today there is very little extra information provided when clicking on an event in the project planner. Recommendation Put extra information in the Project description or take away the possibility to click on an event. In the calendar view unclear expressions like visa efter dag show after day and visa efter vecka show after week are used. Simply deleting the word efter after would make the buttons more easily understandable.   Problem All web parts on the Project site have clickable titles except from Medlemmar Members. Recommendation If clicking on a title opens a window with additional information it is useful. But then clicking should be enabled on every title. If, like today, the opened window reveals limited extra information that extra information should be shown in the first view and clicking should be disabled.   Problem The Project site and also the whole portal is slow, probably because of the https protocol. Recommendation This technical part is not the evaluator Groths area but in general preserve the security but increase speed if possible.  Problem There are expressions like Mtesarbetsyta Meeting workspace in the Project site, which are unknown concept for most people. Recommendation Include a definition of those concepts or use more familiar expressions. In the meeting workspace case an explanation is probably the only alternative.   Further Recommendations  Discussions Discussion boards where students and teachers could ask questions and look for answers would be useful on the Project site. First a general discussion on the first page for debates on topics concerning all students. Second specific discussion boards placed on the document area particular for each student perhaps a folder. There, the student and hisher teacher can  32Results    discuss the progress on the work How far has Lisa come on her essay What does she want me to take a look at It is possible that the second suggestion is not feasible to implement on the Project site. Today one can only discuss documents inside the file.   Synchronous discussions would add value to the Project site. Today the project space is strictly asynchronous but with possibility to see when other members are online realtime discussions can take place. The authors note This would require Live Communications Sever to be integrated in the Learning Gateway.   Surveys The builtin function to make surveys is unfortunately not utilized even though teachers almost certainly have questions they want to pose to the whole class or feedback they need on different issues.  Overview of the activity in the Project site As a teacher it could be useful to see user statistics, for example to see if the students have visited the site recently. This functionality is available if you choose to edit the page in MS FrontPage, see figure 11.     Figure 11. How to activate usage reports in Microsoft FrontPage.    33Results    Summary of Posttest Questionnaire The expert evaluator Kristina Groth concludes that the Learning Gateway is easy to use and easy to remember. The simple details are easy to learn but there is much confusion regarding navigation menus etc. She thinks that the Learning Gateway can facilitate the communication between teachers and students and regarding communication between students she is doubtful that there is a need for that. Concerning the user experience how enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing etc. a software application is she thinks it is high since the interface is clear and clean.   When it comes to the Learning Gateways potential to increase productivity she is not so sure. But she says it probably makes it more obvious where to find information and gives the teacher better control and makes it easier for them to keep an eye on their students. The average users requirements are more or less met by the site according Groth, especially with increased possibilities for discussions.   4.3 Results from the Enduser Evaluation  Students  The questionnaires and interview questions are found in appendix F.  The Users Background The three users all 15 years old, filled out a questionnaire about their background, which showed that they are familiar with computers, they use them daily and consider themselves to manage computer well. Yet they have only used the Learning Gateway a few minutes each during the class introduction to it. Therefore the students can be seen as almost first time users. The reason why they have not used the Learning Gateway more is due to the fact that the school does not have Microsoft Office 2003, only an earlier Office version, which meant that the functions they mainly needed, did not work. Incompatibility like this is a serious usability issue.   Summary of Pre Test Group Discussion  Generally the students ask the teachers for help with their tasks in connection with the lesson, before, during or after. Communication between the teachers and the students is limited to the time they are in the classroom. Email is sometimes used but is far from common. The students seemed rather surprised when I asked if email was used. The students do not consider this to be a problem though. In the classroom they get immediate answers to their questions, which they think is good. When you send email you never know when you can expect an answer one of them said. The students quite often do group work that continues a longer period but they cannot point out any collaboration problems that occur during that group work. Normally they sit together at school to finish the tasks in the group work and therefore they have never encountered problems with document sharing over distance.   Summary of the Scenarios The problems discovered during the scenarios are summarized and categorized below.   34Results    Navigation In the beginning the users had difficulties to find the way back when they did not end up in the right place. If you do not want to click several times on the back button in the browser. After a while the users learned to utilize the Home button in the upper left corner. It is not intuitive to click on the lists, for example the Material list figure 12. This list gets you to the page from where you can upload documents. Therefore it is complicated for the users to know how to carry out scenario 2. Besides this the users seem to think that navigation is reasonably intuitive.     Figure 12. The Material list.   Documents The users find uploading documents to be simple, which is very positive since this is one of the main functions on this site today. However, it is unclear for the user how to proceed when the document URL has been found through browsing. They seem to miss the Save and Close button, marked in figure 13a.    a     b  Figure 13 a The Save and close button and b the Shared Workspace menu. The menu here is in English, because this computer has Microsoft Word installed in English, this has not got to do with the Learning Gateway.   The users are also quite concerned about the fact that other students can open and edit their personal documents. They suggest that they should be able to edit their own documents but not their classmates. The Shared workspace menu figure 13b on the right of the document has far too many and unintelligible functions. Therefore it would be good with information boxes that appear on mouse over.    35Results    Links It is difficult to remove links. Documents can be deleted via the drop down lists but links cannot, which is very inconsequent. Additionally the links did not work when testing. The Learning Gateway did not seem to connect to the Internet but that could have been a temporary error.   Language The language is difficult to understand and it is a mix of Swedish and English not only on certain terms, which would have been acceptable. The terminology is not adjusted to the target group, for example they do not even understand the meaning of the term announcement avisering in Swedish. When the word is explained there is no problem for the students to create the announcements.   Log in For some reason several sign ins were needed per scenario during the testing, which normally does not happen in the Learning Gateway according to a teacher at the school in Nacka. But when it happens it is a great usability problem.   Error correction To remove documents, links and so on are in general more difficult than to add them, which breaks the usability design principle that it should be easy to correct mistakes. On the other hand one can argue that to remove for example a link by mistake is worse than to accidentally add one and not be able to remove it easily. Consequently the steps for removing links should be simplified, but not to an extent where it is so easy that users do it by mistake.   Summary of the Best and Worst Lists As described above socalled Best and Worst lists were created by the students where they described what they liked and disliked with the system. All comments are presented here, even the comments similar to the findings above are included.  Worst  Back buttons are missing.   Too difficult to understand navigation and language.  It is possible to make changes in other peoples documents.   It is difficult to find My Website.  If you click on your own document, you want to edit it and not only read it, which is the case now. To edit you have to click the arrow and choose Edit in Microsoft Word.   Sometimes the whole project site in the Learning Gateway is shut down when you click the close button the cross in Microsoft Word.  Best  It is good that you can read other students documents and get ideas from them.   36Results     Summary of the Posttest Questionnaire The questionnaires and interview questions from the Enduser evaluation are found in appendix F. Below follows a summary of the answers.  The overall impression of the Learning Gateway project site is over average.   It is neither easy nor difficult to use the site, or to learn how to use it.   Navigation is average.   The aesthetic design of the page is considered to be ok, but quite boring.   It is a bit more engaging to use the project site for schoolwork compared to do the work in an ordinary way.   The site causes some frustration and irritation since it is not working properly the whole time.  To use the project site means more benefits than disadvantages.   Summary of the Posttest Interview The students suppose that they maybe would ask their classmates for help with homework etc. if they were logged in to the Learning Gateway at the same time and were able to communicate through the site. With the Learning Gateway it would be easier to contact classmates they normally do not talk to at school, they say. When I suggested a bulletin board on the site they were relatively positive. They think that they would read other students texts but probably not make comments on them, since they only read because they are curious.   With a project site like this they believe that it would be easier to get comments from their teachers on their work during the work process, which is good. These students use MSN Messenger and they often ask questions to their friends about homework via Messenger. If a function for discussioninstant messaging would be incorporated into the Learning Gateway they therefore think they would use it. Concerning the functions provided they do not think any of the functions are unnecessary but they miss functions that would make it easier for them to contact their teachers, since they have so many different teachers.   4.4 Results from the Enduser Evaluation  Teachers  This is a summary of the opinions about Learning Gateway expressed during an interview with a teacher that has worked with the Learning Gateway.   One of the advantages with the Learning Gateway is that it provides means for working process oriented. But many teachers are not used to work that way, for example they normally do not give response to their students during the work process, only afterwards. The reason for this is in most cases that there are too many students and too little time. But there is a chance that the Learning Gateway can facilitate for students to help each other during the work process, which would change the situation. One should not implement a solution like the Learning gateway because one wishes to increase efficiency though.   The Learning Gateway could definitely support collaborative learning, providing that the teachers make task that encourage collaboration. For some reason the students think that they cannot contact their teachers digitally, for example via MSN Messenger. They seem  37Results    surprised that adults can use those programs. But solutions like Learning Gateway could make this easier and more natural. The Learning Gateway could also facilitate parents insight in their childrens schoolwork, providing the sign in issues are solved.  To create pages and sites in the Learning Gateway is very difficult for first time users. The great complexity of the system is not hidden for inexperienced users like one could wish. Interfaces should be intuitive and you should not need a manual, but that is not really the case with the Learning Gateway. There are so many different parts and functions and it is so large that you wonder, Where will this be saved What functions will there be on the page I create And Will I be able to change this later But at the same time those advanced functions must be available otherwise really usable, customized portals cannot be made. Readymade portals are not a solution. It is important though that the students do not get, for example, such great amounts of groups that they cannot handle them.   Normally no problems occur when using the Learning Gateway. It is stable and secure the problem is rather that one often does not understand how it works. But the help functions have almost never been used on the other hand. To correct mistakes is quite difficult, for example removing pages that did not come out as you wished. The document handling functions should also be improved, so it gets easier to edit documents.  The overall figure is that the Learning Gateway definitely could support communication and collaboration between teachers and students. It provides a new exiting way of learning and makes the work process smoother. There is a risk though those portal solutions make learning too individual and that the 24hour availability stresses the students.   This teacher also collected his colleagues opinions about the usability of the Learning Gateway. Here follows a summary of that material, mostly concerning the editing of the sites.    The language changes between English and Swedish, for example to add a listing is sometimes called Lgg till lista in Swedish, and sometimes Add listing in English.    The web parts in the webpart library web parts that you can add to a page changes depending on what page you are at, which is confusing.    If you are at the start page and use the search function you get no results.    In the calendar view you are not able to click an activity to see more information about that activity.    No log out button can be found.    In discussion boards for example, the user IDs and not the persons real names are shown.    When the teachers create a document they want to be able to directly upload it to the  Learning Gateway since they consider the browsing for documents too time consuming.    38Results     Sometimes the single sign on does not work, which bothers the teachers and they need to log in again to check email, read or add documents.    Some documents, for example .pdf, are not shown with their real icons in document libraries, which is confusing.    The slowness of the Learning Gateway due to the https protocol is unacceptable. If it is not possible to correct in another way they want to lower the security.    There seem to be a lack of consistency in the Learning Gateway. Sometimes things work and sometimes not. Probably this is not random, but since it appears random to the users there is something wrong with the user interface.    The administrative rights connected to the different users are not clear since some teachers are not allowed to edit the pages they should be able to edit etc.    Documents and pages that a user does not have access to should not be visible for that user. Teachers and students should have different views of the Learning Gateway different looks, different information.   The teachers want to be able to add alerts to their students and add class pages as links on the students pages My Web page. Today they only know how to add links and alert on your own pageaccount.   There is a need to see who is logged in.  4.5 Results from the Developer Evaluation Summary of the Developer Questionnaire All of the developers in my study normally used Windows OS and their knowledge and experience of Visual Studio varied from novice to a little experience of working with Visual Studio for several years ago. For the novices it was complicated to learn how to use VS2005. This was fun but way too difficult for me They had many problems, and most of them they did not manage to solve. They also found the layout to be difficult to navigate in and the terminology and language not the programming language though was difficult to understand. First time users seem to be doubtful that they could be productive in a relatively short time using VS2005. The word relatively was used in the questionnaire because what is seen as a short time to learn how to use an application varies very much. The important thing to distinguish was whether they perceived the time as short or long. First time users were also uncertain that VS2005 could be useful to developers at a municipal level. One of them said I thought it would be easier to work with VS2005 than it was, almost everything was problematic for me On the other hand, the developers with a slight experience of Visual Studio thought that they could be productive in short time. According to one of them the tool was easy to learn how to use. Except from minor problems it was very fun to use.   Two of the developers stated that they had problems with unintelligible error messages, for example when they wanted to preview their web parts in the browser. Also, they believe that  39Results    the error code messages demands quite some code knowledge. On the other hand they find it very helpful that you move to the incorrect code when clicking on the error code message. Almost every developer in my study encountered great problems with the installation of VS2005. The developers request good educational material and assistance on the web to get started with VS2005. Generally the developers considered the lab quite time consuming but fun. It took a long time to complete the lab but it was very well designed. And a developer with some previous VS experience wrote It was fun to renew my old knowledge and VS2005 is very user friendly.   40Analysis    5 Analysis  In this chapter the collected data and the results are analyzed and interpreted. The questions posed in the beginning of the thesis are discussed on the basis of the gathered information.   The questions to be answered in this thesis are, once again Does the Learning Gateway support and extend collaboration between endusers In other words, can the Learning Gateway be classified as good groupware How should a SharePoint implementation be designed to support collaboration And is development for the Learning Gateway usable for developers at a municipal level To answer the first and second question I initially evaluate the Learning Gateway on the basis of the general design principles, relevant for Groupware like the Learning Gateway, presented in the theory chapter. They are repeated in a shortened and interpreted version below.  5.1 General Design Principles for Groupware Note that the design principles are not ordered after relevance.    Provide a Locale spacecenterhomepage that collects people, artifacts and resources needed for a group to pursue group and task work.    Support Customization. Provide a way to tailor the groupware to match the needs of a specific group of users in their specific context. It should also be possible to structure and organize the groupwarelocales in a way that feels natural for a specific group of users. Allow individual views that reflect a specific users degree of focus and participation in a locale. If a user is a member of several locales  provide a way to organize and relate the locales to one another.    Hide complexity. Groupware is more technically complex than single user applications, but since groupware is used more seldom than single user applications it must be more easy to use. Therefore most of the unnecessary complexity should be hidden. Groupware cannot be simplified to any extent though, it still has to be advanced enough to support the complex human way of communicating.    Support Flexibility. Provide a way to add and remove members and documents, form sub groups, create new locales and remove old ones. Groupware should be dynamic, in other words evolve transparently along with the users and the artifacts. Different communication styles should also be supported.    Provide a Document repository  the knowledge base.    Provide an internal Search engine. Search usability is said to constitute the biggest difference between good and bad groupware.    Provide a Shared workspace for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration or meetings.   41Analysis      Provide a Conversation space for synchronous discussions on topics related to its domain.    Provide an Area for Floating questions in the community.   Support Awareness. Helps users to maintain a sense of shared place. Who is there What has happened to the shared objects And whenhowwhy did it happen    Support Heterogeneity. Support heterogeneous views that occur due to user preferences, available hardware and software or collaboration topics. Provide platform independence.    Support Application integration. Since groupware is used more seldom than single user applications, they should preferably be integrated to increase the frequency of use of the groupware. In that way the familiarity and thus the usability rise.   5.2 Analysis of the Learning Gateway  on the Basis of the Groupware Design Principles When evaluating the Learning Gateway on the basis of the groupware design principles one finds several positive aspects of it but also many constraints.   The Learning Gateway provides a good locale even though the focus is on gathering artifacts and resources rather than people. Customization is supported in various ways. The interface components in the Learning Gateway are individual modules  web parts, which are quite easy to change. But, that means change to another readymade module. To create completely new models seems too difficult see the developer analysis below. Apart from changing the web parts, customization is rather difficult because of the many functions, alternatives, menus, submenus and unexpected effects. In other words, the Learning Gateway is customizable to a great extent, but it is too difficult. Also regarding customization, at a higher level that is to say the whole schools sites for example, it is very important to define the user requirements at a specific school and tailor the implementation after them and not use standardize solutions or do random customizations.  The hidden complexity principle is not applied in the Learning Gateway, which means good overview is not achieved. For the advanced user the large amount of choices is probably very useful but most likely, the average user finds it confusing. This was confirmed by the interviewed teacher. The aim of all applications should be that beginners should be able to use the system effectively. A way of analyzing a systems learnability is to apply the 10 minute rule Preece et al. 2002. It proposes that beginners should be able to use a system in less than 10 minutes, if not the system fails. On the basis of the 10 minute rule the Learning Gateways learnability is low. On the other hand you can expect the users to be willing to spend quite some time learning the system if they are going to use it for several years, like in the case with the Learning Gateway. It should be possible to understand and use the most basic functions in the Learning Gateway after 10 minutes and the other, more advanced features could then be learned in an exploratory way during further usage.   42Analysis    Flexibility is supported even though it is not effortless. During the user tests several users complained about difficulties removing objects they had added to the Learning Gateway. To for example add and remove members, documents and locales is a fundamental function and it is crucial that these work very well. Since it has been showed that roles changes throughout groupware usage, the access rights connected to specific users must be made changeable. This seems to be a problem with the Learning Gateway according to the teachers. Throughout the semesters the groups that the students participate in change, some groups are added and some groups are removed, depending on the current courses. The students personal views my page should therefore be flexible and evolving so that it always shows an overview of the groups that a student is a part of.   A document repository called document library and a search engine are provided and on the basis of my testing they work well except from some usability constraints There were a number of complaints about the search engine on some pages and a few document icons did not show in the library. When creating documents in Word for example one can save it directly in the Learning Gateway, just as a teacher sought after. The fact that the specific teacher had not noticed is a usability problem though.    Shared workspaces are provided in shape of document workspaces and meeting workspaces but they did not feel relevant to test on the particular age group. In the usability testing with students there were notable difficulties handling the document workspaces though. The documents in the document library are opened in a shared documents mode when clicked on. This tends to be confusing for the students. As written above, the document workspace menu has definitely got too many options see figure 13b and for example the users do not know where a document will be saved when they click on Save.   When it comes to conversation spaces for synchronous collaboration the Learning Gateway does not have much to offer. At least that is valid for the implementation I studied. But as said before, there are several servers that can be added to the Learning Gateway, for example Microsoft Live Communication Server. With Live Communication Server instant messaging and live meetings are added to the Learning Gateway. If CSCL ComputerSupported Collaborative Learning should be supported synchronous features are needed. Otherwise the Learning Gateway is just document repository, even if it is an advanced one. Conversational spaces like digital whiteboards and areas for floating questions in the community are unfortunately missing today. There is also another aspect of synchronous groupware though. If one looks in groupware literature on the categories of groupware discussed there, the trend seems to move from synchronous, colocated activities to long term, distributed ones, like SharePoint. Thus this movement is away from colocated activities but it does not have to mean that we move away from synchronous features.   Regarding the awareness, and more specifically awareness about the shared objects, the Learning Gateway supports that through its good version handling system. It is easy to monitor what has happened with shared objects, who has made the changes and when. But again, the lack of Live Communication Server means that there are no possibilities to see who is logged in at the same time as you. The awareness of who is logged in and contactable was requested from both students and teachers.   The Learning Gateway fully supports heterogeneity when it comes to the ability to personalize the interface  heterogeneous views. But it is not platform independent since the interface problems comes up when using Mac and other browsers than Internet Explorer. The  43Analysis    Learning Gateway also requires the latest Microsoft software to function ideally, for example, many of the functions only work well with Microsoft Office 2003. And it is common knowledge that schools seldom have the time, money and skills to keep updated on the latest software versions. Poor versions of the Learning Gateway, in other words without Live Communication Server, Office 2003 and other needed software leads to unhappy users. This because it is obvious that some important addons are missing and the schools know that it cost extra money to get them.   Also concerning heterogeneity and platform independence one trend in daytoday computing is to be able to move seamlessly from large powerful workstations to small handheld devices. This means heterogeneity in processor speed, memory, input devices, displays and bandwidth for example. In the future this kind of heterogeneity must be taken care of by the Learning Gateway. Computers and the Internet are changing our ways of learning today, with for example increased flexibility. But we can expect that our mobile phones will become a valuable learning tool because of its total mobility and high usage.   The Learning Gateway supports application integration to a certain extent since one can edit MS Office documents via the document workspace. The integration should be taken further however. One of the usability issues with groupware is that it is used too seldom. Therefore the Learning Gateway should comprise other applications used at school, for example email and eventually homework distribution over the Internet. If so it would be used more often and it would be the true gateway it was intended to be. But then again addons have to be bought, like Exchange Server and Class Server.   5.3 Developer Analysis To answer the question whether development for the Learning Gateway is usable for developers at a municipal level I analyzed the results from the developer lab. As said above, a common belief at Microsoft is that Visual Studio has a low threshold of learning and makes beginners productive fast. This proved not to be valid if the beginners are first time users. For basic level developers this might be true though. The threshold of learning can probably never be totally eliminated, with the efficiency for advanced users kept unchanged. But it has to be lowered for Visual Studio 2005 because the users in this study found the tool very difficult even though they work as ITdevelopers.  Numerous problems were encountered during installation. Since it was not possible to test anything else than the beta version it is difficult to tell if those problems are connected to the beta exclusively. However, the results did not indicate that, since the problems were related to lack of understanding rather than malfunction and errors. According to Microsoft the installation problems could have been avoided if everyone had installed VS2005 on a clean machine, in other words, a machine with no other programs installed on it. As a counter argument one can mention that municipalities almost certainly do not have supplies of clean machines to install Visual Studio on, because of their wellknown low budget. In fact it is probable that no organizations have vast computer supplies. To require one computer per installation is not realistic. Additionally I could have provided the users with an installation manual together with the lab to avoid some problems. Manuals are not a good solution to low usability though. Instead the installation process should be shaped in a way that makes it selfexplanatory. For example Installation wizards should be designed so that they are comprehensible for beginners.   44Analysis     The overall impression of the developer lab was that Visual Studio is not usable for developers at a municipal level, which means that the Learning Gateway is not fully customizable. Developers at a municipal level are just a part of the large group inexperienced but very interested potential users of Visual Studio. The reactions from the contacted IT developers showed that the interest for Visual Studio was high even though many did not have time to participate in the lab. The majority also explicitly wrote that they thought it was fun to use Visual Studio, which is a basic condition for a successful system. If enthusiastic first time users like them abandon the tool because of all the initial usability problems, a large group of potential users are lost. This usability problem is a fact in organizations where there is no existing knowledge of Visual Studio, and new users therefore have no internal way of gaining understanding of the developing tool. The number of organizations like this is estimated to be high.   Additionally there are signs that we are moving to more customizable applications. And it is not only the Learning Gateway that would be more usable through customization development. Many applications would be more usable if there were easy tools to customize them, for example through development in Visual Studio 2005 providing beginners would consider the tool more easy to use than they obviously do today. 45Recommendations    6 Conclusions and Recommendations In this chapter the questions posed in the beginning of the thesis are answered as far as possible out from the results. The problems found and their solutions are summarized and the way the solutions can be implemented is presented. Suggested actions are also given under SharePoint Improvements and General Recommendations to Microsoft.   The expert analysis and the enduser tests with students and teachers all showed that the general opinion is that the Learning Gateway does support and extend collaboration but that there are many problems that need to be solved before it works efficiently. Suggestions on how these problems can be solved are presented here. The other question was if the Learning Gateway can be customized to suit a specific schools needs, in other words if development for the Learning Gateway is usable for developers at a municipal level. In my search for developers it showed that first there are not many developers according to our definition of developers above hired by the municipalities in Sweden. Second Amongst those developers there seems to be few experienced developers. From the questionnaires one can conclude that development in Visual Studio is too difficult for novices. This means that the belief that Visual Studio has a lower threshold of learning and that basic developers can be productive very fast with Visual Studio is not true. It is possible that Visual Studio is easier than other developing tools but still not easy enough for beginners like the developers at a municipal level. Accordingly, the Learning Gateway is not customizable under the specific circumstances.   6.1 Specific Design Guidelines  for the Learning Gateway These guidelines try to give a concrete answer to the question how a SharePoint implementation should be designed to support collaboration. They are based on the groupware design principles, the expert evaluation and the enduser evaluation. These suggestions can, in the future, serve as guidelines on how to designimplement a Learning Gateway at a school, and be used by Microsofts partners who are the ones that will perform the actual implementation.   1. Increase discussion areas and awareness Today the Learning Gateway works mainly as a document repository but to support collaboration there must be more communicationcollaboration possibilities on the different sites. Learning is a social activity that involves collaboration according to modern educational theories. Today the project space is strictly asynchronous happens in different times but synchronous realtime discussions like instant messaging would add much value to the Learning Gateway. This requires the ability to see if other members are logged in and accepts to be contacted, which would require Live Communications Sever to be integrated in the Learning Gateway. But if integrated this would increase the important awareness.   Discussion boards where students and teachers could ask each other questions should be added. One discussion board on the first page for debates on topics concerning all students  46Recommendations    and then specific discussion board for every class, project group and so on. Possibilities to discuss a particular students documents in a simple way are also wanted How far has Lisa come on her essay What does she want me to take a look at Today it is only possible to discuss documents inside the file, but the students work can include several files. Always show the real names and not the user ID of the debaters. Email should also be tightly incorporated in the Learning Gateway to facilitate usage. Other solutions to post questions to the teachers  like email via a simple web form on the site would also be good.   2. Carefully organize the rights connected to different accounts and roles in the system  It is central that only the persons intended have the rights to change content etc. to prevail the reliability of the system. The different roles and thus different administrative rights must be very clear. Today the students are concerned about the fact that their classmates can edit their personal documents, which of course is not acceptable. Shared documents on the other hand should be editable by the group of students sharing the document. The teachers want to be able to post alerts and links on the students pagesaccounts. At the moment they only know how to add links and alert on your own pageaccount. The very important single sign on sometimes does not work and you need to log in again to read or add documents for example. The reason or solution to this is not the authors area but when it happens the users get very bothered so it is crucial to sort this out. Additionally no log out button can be found.  3. Hide complexity and improve visibility Make actions, pages and document not intended for a specific user invisible. Today the interface is full of irrelevant text and links for example the button to add a new event in the project planner. This makes the important information relatively less visible and makes the whole Learning Gateway appear more cluttered and complex than is necessary. If an action is available for a specific user group, but just not at the moment it should be marked gray according to the specific platform conventions.   4. Use understandable and consistent language Adjust the language to the target group. For example the students do not understand the meaning of the term announcement, avisering in Swedish. There are also expressions like Meeting workspace Mtesarbetsyta in the Project site, which are unknown concept for most people. Hence include a definition of those concepts or use more familiar expressions. For meeting workspace an explanation is probably the only alternative. In the calendar view unclear expressions like show after day visa efter dag and show after week visa efter vecka are used. Simply deleting the word efter after would make the buttons more easily understandable. Material, like the document area is called, is also a very broad term. For example Links etc can be seen as material. If there, like in this case, the only things under Material are the students documents, then simply call it Students Documents.   Use the same name for identical functions to avoid unnecessary confusion and increase productivity. For example Add document is sometimes called Upload document but should constantly be called Add document, see figure 10. Moreover there is another button under Material that says New Document, which can be seen as confusingly similar to adding a document. New document opens a template for a word document that can be saved directly into the Material library. Only use Swedish in the Swedish version of Learning Gateway. Today the language changes between English and Swedish, for example to add a listing is sometimes called Lgg till lista in Swedish, and sometimes Add listing in  47Recommendations    English. English loanwords are definitely accepted. These are all small but important changes that will lead to less misunderstandings and increase efficiency.   5. Design away the need of manuals Make the implementation work well without manuals. Good interfaces should be self explanatory for normal usage. The home made manuals that started to spread amongst the teachers in Nacka can be seen as a failure for the Learning Gateways interface and the help function. Some of the problems originate in the SharePoint structure see SharePoint improvements but some are possible to design away in the implementation. Examples Make the pages as fool proof as possible so that the users feel safe to learn through trial and error rather than through manuals. This is related to the access rights above, because it should not be possible to accidentally delete others objects. Perform usability test on the implementation and change it according to the results of them. Simple usability tests can be found in Dumas A Practical Guide to Usability Testing 1999.  6. Implement surveys Add the builtin function to make surveys on relevant pages. This is a simple and smart way for teachers to pose questions to the whole class or to get feedback on different issues. 7. Log usage  Usage of the different sites should be logged so that, for example, sites that are often used can be moved higher up in the information structure. The user statistics could also increase the teachers awareness of the students activity. The user data should of course be treated anonymously as far as possible. This functionality is available if you choose to edit the page in MS FrontPage, see figure 11.  8. Increase engagement Make the page more fun The aesthetic design of todays project site is considered by the students to be ok, but quite boring. The user experience is very important for the frequency of use. The design should stay quite formal but depending on the age of the users it could definitely be cheered up remarkably with figures, illustrations and colors. Make the sites personal and do not only change to another readymade theme.   9. Support heterogeneity Teachers and students should have different views of the Learning Gateway different looks, different information.   10. Increase speed A major usability issue today is the slowness when using the Learning Gateway due to the https protocol etc. If this is possible for the one implementing the Learning Gateway at a school to solve it should be done immediately. The teachers are so bothered by this that they are willing to lower the security, but that should definitely not be done.   11. Design structured, consistent and according to user needs Disable the clicking if no additional information is provided when clicking and getting another view. For example when clicking on an event in the project planner you get very little extra information. To many pages, especially without new information, this just worsens the overview. Besides, some titles like Members and Material are clickable but some are not. Use links consistent.   48Recommendations     Indicate results of clicking. For example when clicking on Project planning you get an unexpected calendar view. If a calendar view is sought after the button taking you to that view should indicate that. In the calendar view on the other hand you are NOT able to click an activity to see more information about that activity, which is inconsistent.   Structure the pagesgroupslocales in a way that correspond to the organization of the specific school teams of teachers, lessons, physical locations and curriculum. No standard solutions will work. This structure will constantly evolve so the design should be flexible and easy to change.  6.2 How to Increase the Customizability  of the Learning Gateway  Developer Perspective Development for  advanced customization of the Learning Gateway turned out to be too difficult for developers at a municipal level. Below are some suggestions presented on how to improve the situation.   As concluded above, first time users of Visual Studio find it too difficult despite the fact that they are titled IT developers. Visual Studio might have a lower learning threshold than other developing tools but unfortunately it is not low enough. This eventual lead in usability over the competitors should therefore be utilized better. Today experienced users of other developing tools can move to Visual Studio quite easily but not the numerous new users. Advanced users are supported but not the beginners. Every advanced user has started as a beginner and therefore the tool that wins most beginners will be most successful. The first developing tool used will always have an important position amongst other tools. Beginners are an important user group if one wants to increase the number of users of a tool, without necessarily winning users from competitors.   This study showed a great interest for Visual Studio amongst IT developers with no experience and this initial interest should be taken care of. Make use of the attention during the release of Visual Studio 2005 and launch a program to introduce new users. This should preferably be taken care of by MSDN Microsoft Developer Network, and not only independent communities, since Microsoft should show that they support and welcome new users. To easily and understandable explain something advanced, like Visual Studio, requires deep knowledge, like the knowledge found at DPE the department responsible for MSDN Sweden.   Suggested actions  Make a part of MSDN www.microsoft.comsverigemsdn dedicated to new users called for example MSDN basics  MSDN for beginners  MSDN for dummies including    A Visual Studio Glossary, since the language and the terminology in Visual Studio proved to be too difficult.   Introductory material for Visual Studio easy and fun labs, lessons, walkthroughs and TV clips like the ones already at MSDN web TV.   Inspirational material to show the possibilities with Visual Studio 2005.   49Recommendations     Special community for new users, eventually connected to more advanced communities for complex questions. Of course MSDN community support could be utilized too.   This part of MSDN should be 100 in Swedish to feel familiar even though it belongs to a huge organization.   The atmosphere should be prestigeless and humble no one should feel too green.  Many of the developers in the study expressed how fun they thought it was to try Visual Studio. Take advantage of this and focus on making the introduction to VS enjoyable. Developers will then introduce themselves to Visual Studio on their spare time. Specifically for the Learning Gateway Inform the administrators of the Learning Gateway about this introductory material available so that they can learn how to really customize the Learning Gateway. Facilitate the sharing of the web parts produced at different schools.   If new users of Visual Studio are supported, they will develop their knowledge of the tool and turn in to skilled programmers that will give Visual Studio high credibility. A good developing tool supports new users and makes it possible for them to develop to advanced users. This is what Visual Studio should strive for.   6.3 SharePoint Improvements These suggestions can probably only be implemented by the SharePoint developing team.    Compatibility and heterogeneity. Make SharePoint and thus the Learning Gateway seamlessly compatible with other operating systems and browsers. Today there are remarkable interface changes when using the Learning Gateway with Mac OS and Safari browser. Even though the stationary computers at schools normally are PCs with Windows, the Learning Gateway will be used on the increasing number of laptops and from home where other software and hardware used. Show files other than Microsofts own, with correct icons. Now for example .pdf documents are shown with an unfamiliar icon.   Mobility. Make the Learning Gateway possible to use on handheld devices like pocket PCs and in the future on mobile phones to increase the flexibility of learning.    Error prevention and Help. Check out documents automatically to prevent sharing violation. Always enable redo, and ask twiceinform the users when deleting or replacing. When you add updated files today to a document library there is no dialog box asking if you want to replace the existing file, it is simply placed in the version history. Since the users do not necessarily know that, and might think they lost the file they should be informed. Make the help specific for the current page or function to increase efficiency in the problem solving.   The web parts in the web part library web parts that you can add to a page should not change depending on what page you are at.   Mouse overinformation. For example The Shared workspace menu has far too many and unintelligible functions. Therefore it would be very good with information boxes that appear on mouse over.    50Recommendations     Workflow. Enable Drag and drop in the document library to facilitate efficient workflow. Make it as easy to remove objects, as it is to add them. The difficulties with removing objects were pointed out by several users.  6.4 General Recommendations to Microsoft  Concerning the Learning Gateway  After studied and interviewed users of the Learning Gateway in the age of 15 it showed that it probably would be more useful for older students, from the Swedish Gymnasium level High school and higher. At least in the way it is designed today. Younger students do not collaborate in the way that is supported by the Learning Gateway and they cannot take advantage of all the advanced functions and the potential of the Learning Gateway. Perhaps the basic functionality is found to be so usable that this fact could be overseen though. Therefore it would be better if Microsoft focused on this older target group since it is not possible to make a solution like this that suits everyone from 7 years to grown ups.   Another solution to the problem above would be to make a redesigned version of SharePoint that from the beginning is shaped to suit young students. That would probably be smart since in interaction with the Learning Gateway it is quite noticeable that its base, SharePoint is developed for the industry and not especially for a learning environment. The focus is on archiving and sharing of existing knowledge artifacts  knowledge management. That is enough to support CSCW but not CSCL ComputerSupported Collaborative WorkLearning. SharePoint probably works well as the solution it was developed to be but when moved in to an educational environment it does not completely meet the needs there.  It is also important for Microsoft not to promote the Learning Gateway as a solution that increases efficiency for the teachers. At least not increased efficiency with respect to less work for the teachers. The teachers must be prepared to do some extra work at least in the beginning, even though they can expect plenty of positive effects of the Learning Gateway.   As said above, incomplete versions of the Learning Gateway lead to unsatisfied customers. Schools have a tight budget and will buy the cheapest alternative, in other words Learning Gateway with no extra servers. Then they will be constantly reminded of the lack of those extra servers since there are functions in the Learning Gateway not working without them. Probably they feel so unsatisfied that they will buy the extras and suddenly the expenses got higher than budgeted for. Instead Microsoft should sell full versions of the Learning Gateway with Live Communication Server, Class Server, Exchange and the latest Office package but probably for a lower price than today. Because it is when you integrate the different solutions that the Learning Gateway reaches its full potential.   The Office package and Exchange Server is important to add to the Learning Gateway because it leads to higher application integration. If oftenused applications are integrated with the Learning Gateway it will soon be familiar to the users and therefore more easy to use. Then it will become the true gateway it is intended to be.     51Discussion    7 Discussion  This chapter starts with reflections over the methods used and the work process. Then the future potential of the Learning Gateway is explored and suggestions on further research in this area are given.  7.1 Method Reflection To obtain valuable information from users is in general difficult, which was noticed in this study. The users can seldom express their needs. They often do not even know they have a need until they discover a product that fulfils the needs. Except for the observations, the information source in the study was mainly what the users said, for example what they said was problematic with the Learning Gateway, which might not have been what really was problematic. Longterm ethnographical studies to see how the users really interacted with the system would probably have given better information, even though those studies are far from uncomplicated. It is said that users often tell the interviewer what they think shehe wants to hear. The students in this study seemed to do that, probably because they were shy. When they were quiet it was difficult not to ask leading questions to make them talk. A more experienced interviewer would probably have waited longer for the answers, which probably were on the way. The influence of the interviewer on the persons interviewed is impossible to remove but because of the other positive aspects of interviewing the method still makes it excel over questionnaires etc.   Different methods were used in the student evaluation because of the expected broader scope of information gathered. However it showed that the same problems were found over and over again instead. This does not mean that it was totally ineffective to use several methods though, since it was proved that the problems really were problems. Similar problems were also found in the teacher evaluation. The students in this study were more familiar with computers than average, which means that for other students, the Learning Gateway might not be as easy to learn etc as they considered. In general more users should have been tested to get more accurate results, but the number of users is almost always a problem. The aim was to gain a better understanding of the usage of the Learning Gateway and that was achieved.   7.2 Work Process Reflection During this study a recurring difficulty has been to separate single user usability and groupware usability. Almost all collaborative functions include single user actions, which means they are impossible to separate. On the other hand there are several usability issues concerning only groupware, but when studying them it is very easy to involve single user actions. Therefore this thesis is not strictly focused on groupware usability as intended. Another problem was that, due to my strong interest in the area the literature study continued for a longer time than planned and was much broader than necessary.    52Discussion    The fact that there are very many people involved in the Learning Gateway worldwide at Microsoft makes it both easy and difficult to study. It was difficult for me as an outsider to stay aware of everything that happened around the Learning Gateway. And many people were also involved when deciding the focus of the study, which for that and other reasons took quite long time. At the same time there are many people to ask when questions arise. In general I spent too much time trying to find information on my own instead of asking questions though, which afterwards proved to be very time inefficient, even though it was very enlightening. Because of the technical complexity of the Learning Gateway and the terminology surrounding it and all other Microsoft products there is much to learn before a study like this can start. Probably some of these preparatory studies could have been left out, but that is always easy to say afterwards. Additionally many of the problems related to the Learning Gateway can only be solved by the persons developing it. The fact that they are situated so far away decreases the possible influence of this study.  7.3 Future  A problematic aspect in discussions about CSCL is that information and knowledge too often is mixed up. The transformation of information into knowledge is very complicated and also the transfer of knowledge between individuals. Therefore those aspects should get more attention in the discussion. Nowadays, the main issue is not the lack of the technology necessary to support certain activities, but the risk of focusing too much on technology without paying enough attention to its relation with the learning process and to the use students and teachers make of it.   As mentioned above, there has been a relatively recent shift of educational theories towards constructivism which considers learning to be a social activity that involves collaboration and knowledge to be actively constructed by individuals while working together. This movement applied on groupware could lead to CSCL tools that do not even provide managing, teaching or content modules. The focus would be entirely on communication and collaboration activities, on knowledge building rather than knowledge management. The Learning Gateway would be improved if it moved from being a document repository towards a collaboration and communications tool. And that its users should move towards a learning community that develops, defines and shares its knowledge. Many teachers seem to seek a collaborative tool that also facilitates their administrative work. That is understandable but the Learning Gateway first of all should support the students and teachers need of publication, cooperation, communication, instruction and support  in other words learning.  An interesting question to be answered somewhere else than in this thesis is what groupware should aim at beyond the reproduction of precomputer forms of interaction. The Learning Gateway has to show what advantages it has compared to ordinary, real world collaboration and free groupware web groups etc to be truly valuable.   53 8 References 8.1 Books Bell, Judith.

Well, better late than never.  Most systems today do not fall into one simple category but combine multiple tools into a platform. So SharePoint is probably primarily a file sharing system, but it includes some less developed interactive capabilities that make more appropriate as a platform for communities of practice.  All the best,  Etienne    My new research agenda is available at www.ewenger.comresearch httpwww.ewenger.comresearch  Check out our community of practice on communities of practice at www.cpsquare.org httpwww.cpsquare.org  For online workshops on communities of practice, check www.cpsquare.orgedu httpwww.cpsquare.orgedu  A study on communityoriented technology is available at www.ewenger.comtech httpwww.ewenger.comtech    Etienne Wenger P.O.

I have a question that I would be very grateful if you would answer  How would you classify Microsofts collaborative technology SharePoint when it is used in schools according to your classification model  httpwww.microsoft.comsharepoint Hoping to hear from you. Sincerely  Andrea Rosengren  62  63Appendix C Ten Usability Heuristics by Jakob Nielsen  Visibility of system status  The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.  Match between system and the real world  The system should speak the users language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than systemoriented terms. Follow realworld conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.  User control and freedom  Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.  Consistency and standards  Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.  Error prevention  Even better than good error messages is a careful design, which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place.  Recognition rather than recall  Make objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.  Flexibility and efficiency of use  Accelerators, unseen by the novice user, may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.  Aesthetic and minimalist design  Dialogues should not contain information, which is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.  Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors  Error messages should be expressed in plain language no codes, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.  Help and documentation  Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, focused on the users task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.        Nielsen 2004 httpwww.useit.compapersheuristicheuristiclist.html  Appendix D Competitive Evaluation    64      65  66     Appendix E Scenarios and Tasks of the Cognitive Walkthrough in the Expert Evaluation   Every task has a ideal way to perform it, which is described in user actions UA and system displays SD.

If you for some reason have not, please contact me or order it from httpwww.microsoft.combetaexperience. That is also the address if you want more information about Visual Studio.   The lab task will take approximately 70 min plus the time it will take to answer the questions. The programming language used in the lab is C concerning the ordinary language I apologize for the mixture of Swedish and English but since the lab is more like a walkthrough than an actual lab it should be possible to do without previous experience of C, or Visual Studio.   Please email the completed questionnaires to me before the 30th May. And as you know, you will get the latest version of Visual Studio 2005 sent to you by mail when it is released to the market as thanks for your help.

Web Parts r ett ramverk fr att bygga skrddarsydda portalliknande sidor, s kallade web part pages. Exempelvis r Microsofts Skolportal en portallsning byggd i SharePoint som anvnder sig av web parts. Web controls, user controls eller custom controls r alla olika typer av web parts. Slutanvndare kan anpassa sidorna genom att ndra layouten, lgga till eller ta bort web parts, redigera egenskaper, skapa kopplingar mellan web parts osv. De flesta frndringar p en sida kan gras utan att skriva ngon kod och dessa frndringar kan sparas specifikt fr olika anvndare.  Uppskattad  tidstgng till  denna labb  70 minuter  I denna labb kommer du att bygga en Web Part Page och anvnda den fr att lra knna den Web Parts infrastruktur som r inbyggd i ASP.NET. Under tiden du gr labben r det bra om du antecknar svrigheter och liknande s att du kan fylla i dem i utvrderingsformulret eftert. Titta grna igenom utvrderingen innan du brjar med labben. Eftersom labben egentligen mer har karaktren av en walkthrough p grundlggande niv fr du drfr grna anvnda Visual Studio p egen hand innan du fyller i utvrderingen.      77Utvecklarlabb Skapa individualiserbara applikationer med hjlp av Web Parts              78vning 1  Skapa en Web Parts sida I denna vning kommer du att skapa en ny webbsida och gra den till en Web Parts Page.
