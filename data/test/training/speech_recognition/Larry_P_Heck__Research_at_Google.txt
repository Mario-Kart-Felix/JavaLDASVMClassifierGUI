Heck Research Area(s) Machine Intelligence Natural Language Processing Co-Authors Dilek Hakkani-Tur FranÃ§oise Beaufays Gokhan Tur Oriol Vinyals Pararth Shah Thomas Dean Dr. Larry Heck is currently a Principal Research Scientist with Google Research. In this role, he is responsible for advanced R&D on dialog with machines. From 2009-Â­2014, he was the Chief Scientist of the Microsoft Speech products team and later a Distinguished Engineer in Microsoft Research. In 2009, he coÂ­-founded the initiative that led to Microsoftâ€™s Cortana personal assistant. From 2005 to 2009, he was Vice President of Search & Advertising Sciences at Yahoo!, responsible for the creation, development, and deployment of the algorithms powering Yahoo! Search, Yahoo! Sponsored Search, Yahoo! Content Match, and Yahoo! display advertising. From 1998 to 2005, he was with Nuance Communications and served as Vice President of R&D, responsible for natural language processing, speech recognition, voice authentication, and text-to-speech synthesis technology. He began his career as a researcher at the Stanford Research Institute (1992-1998), initially in the field of acoustics and later in speech research with the Speech Technology and Research (STAR) Laboratory. Dr. Heck received the PhD in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1991. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and has published over 80 scientific papers and holds over 50 United States patents.
