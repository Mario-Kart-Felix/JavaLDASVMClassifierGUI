The areas of developing data transmission solutions via powerlines include outdoor (local loop) and in-house (home networking) solutions. The obvious advantage of PLC is that it is everywhere in the developed world. PLC can deliver high speed, low cost Internet access with 'no new wires', as well as the capability for in-building Local Area Networks. Deregulation has been a major factor in the development of Powerline (tele)communications: Deregulation in telecommunications allows new market entrants to provide services along electricity networks Deregulation in the power supply sector increases the demand for specific energy distribution related information systems. Another opportunity for Powerline technology has been in the area of home-automation and in-house systems. Our Role & Activities ETSI technical committee PLT (Power Line Telecommunications) standardizes PLC (Powerline Communications) systems. PLT has the primary responsibility for standardization of communication devices operating on electrical networks. PLT develops ETSI deliverables to provide communications via the existing low, medium and high voltage power lines. Harmonised standards have been developed to allow presumption of conformity with the relevant EU/EC Directives: Commission Recommendation of 6 April 2005 on broadband electronic communications through powerlines 2005/292/EC . ETSI PLT studies the technical requirements to avoid interference with users of the radio spectrum. As well as working with ETSI technical committee ATTM/TM6, SmartM2M (on HGI-PAS) and ERM, ETSI PLT has liaisons with the ITU-T/SG15, Broadband Forum (BBF), PLC Forum and CENELEC SC205A to establish a fruitful co-operation with these two groups attended by PLC experts. ETSI TC PLT published TS 103 430 on coexistence of VDSL2 and PLT is aligned on Recommendation ITU-T G.9979 Amendment 1. PLT is developing Test Specifications for Plugtest on Coexistence G.Fast and PLT (SISO&MIMO) in coordination with BBF. PLT is working on update and re-publication (TS 103 477) of ETSI GS OSG 001. This GS was originally created under the ETSI ISG OSG. As this ISG is closed and no longer active, its scope now falls under the TC PLT. The security in GS OSG 001 has become obsolete and there was an urgent need to update it to ensure continued protection and security of utility and end user customer information within the use of this protocol. PLT works on Transcoding of HD and UHD video over powerline network. The PLT Chairman with the Support of the ETSI Secretariat is considering a smooth merge proposal of TC PLT with TC ATTM after summer 2017. This will provide sufficient time to negotiate the update of the ToR of TC ATTM before merging TC PLT into ATTM.
