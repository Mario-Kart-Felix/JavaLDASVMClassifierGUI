Environmental aspects considered include:  climatic and biological conditions chemically and mechanically active substances mechanical conditions during storage, transportation and while being used power supply issues including power distribution, earthing and bonding techniques thermal management for equipment and facilities noise emission of equipment. The Technical Committee EE is responsible for defining the environmental and infrastructural aspects for all telecommunication equipment and its environment, including equipment installed in subscriber premises. Where ever possible this will be achieved by references to existing international standards. The field includes: Environmental Conditions Power Supply, Bonding and related topics Mechanical Structure and Physical design Environmental matters associated with Mobile ICT devices Our Role & Activities ETSI technical committee Environmental Engineering (EE) is responsible for defining the environmental and infrastructural aspects for all telecommunication equipment and its environment, including equipment installed in subscriber premises. Wherever possible this will be achieved by references to existing international standards. To this end, the work is carried out in close co-operation with other standards bodies such as ITU-T , CENELEC  and the IEC . The committee is currently working on: Metrics and Measurement Method for Energy Efficiency of ICT equipment Standardization terms and trends in energy efficiency Energy aware networking measurement methods Standards The following is a list of the 20 latest published ETSI standards on environmental aspects. A full list of related standards in the public domain is accessible via the ETSI standards search . Via this interface you can also subscribe for alerts on updates of ETSI standards.
