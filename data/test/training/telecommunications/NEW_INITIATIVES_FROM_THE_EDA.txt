Averbal and a written submission have been madeto the standing committee investigating andreviewing the Regional Partnerships Program. A number of membershave presented at various locations around Australia. It is important that during a time when there are often pessimisticdiscussions about the future of the economy that economic developmentpractitioners provide every opportunity to support businesses andinitiatives that will deliver investment and employment growth. It is alsoimportant that the messages that are sent out are positive and aboutcreating opportunities for innovation and continuous improvement withinbusiness. The forthcoming EDA conference will highlight a number of ways thatthis can be done successfully using case studies and first handexperience. I encourage you and your colleagues to attend theconference in Brisbane to hear first hand how positive initiatives can beput in place in local economies and witness case studies that havedelivered tangible results to successful and sustainable communities.The EDA Board is very excited about the large number of people thathave been enrolled in the two professional development courses. EDAlooks forward to expanding this next year and creating moreopportunities for people to become certified practising economicdevelopment professionals. The EDA Board is also very interested in finding out who will win theawards this year in relation to economic development excellence. Theseawards of course will be announced as part of the EDA conference to beheld in Brisbane in October this year. The EDA Board is currently lookingat other opportunities to involve economic development professionals. This will include the signing of a number of memorandums ofunderstanding with likeminded organisations, also looking atentrepreneurial activities that may increase the focus upon EDA. Thisincludes developing a site selection service or footloose industriesseeking to locate in both urban, interface and regional areas. Whilst theprogram is in its infancy, it is likely that the program will deliver benefitsto EDA members in relation to attracting footloose investment in thelonger term.As always, if you are satisfied with what you have been getting fromEDA, please let other people know about the usefulness of thisorganisation. If you are not satisfied, please contact a member of theBoard. Please note that at the conference in October, the opportunitiesare there for people to come onto the Board and all applications arewelcomed.CONTENTSEDA news update 2State networks report 3News update 6Model methods for revitalising a town centre 12Uplifting the CBD of a regional city15Generating growth in the valley 19Boosting rural business development 21Making the future connections 22Planning for a global economy 24Realising the potential of knowledge based industries 27Powerful case for action 30Eco business is smart business 32Vision of a smart, sustainable city 34Reaping community benefits from carbon trading 37Creating sustainable businesses of the future 41Economic Development JournalThe Economic Development Journal is producedquarterly by the EDA for use by EDA members.

Given that EDAcommenced 5th February, an Audit is underway and anAudited Financial report will be circulated to membersprior to the AGM.Women in Local Government SurveyIn preparation for EDAs participation in the LGMAsWomen in Local Government Management Forum in earlySeptember, Director Margaret Nicholls circulated Fourquestions relating to this topic.

In similar Local Governmentprofessional bodies, fees account for less than one third ofannual revenue. The Board has been examining a numberof proposals which will provide additional enhancedservices, at a price, for members. This includes a register ofconsultants, and additional training activities. EDA has communicated regularly with members via itsweb based email service. These are sent out eitherglobally to all members or specifically to a particular Statemembership.

Their activities include workshops and miniconferences with opportunity for members to upgrade skillsand network with fellow practitioners.Western AustraliaIn Western Australia 16 members attended the EDA WAAGM on 25th July 2008 and the following members wereelected to the Management CommitteeJay Hardison Chair, Trevor Ayers Vice Chair,Marilyn Horgan Secretary, Ling Gaspar Treasurer,Kevin Dorotich and William BarryInquiry into a New RegionalDevelopment Funding ProgramSeveral members of the EDA WA State Practitioner NetworkSPN attended a Parliamentary Roundtable to giveevidence and present comments and opinions on theformation of a replacement program for RegionalDevelopment. Several points were emphasised The definition of region must include metropolitanregions There should be a tiered approach to funding approval.Projects of less than 50,000 Federal fundingcontribution should be able to be approved by the newRegional Development Australia RDA boards, withlarger programs requiring Departmental and Ministerialapproval All applications for Regional Development funding mustbe referred to the relevant RDA. The practice ofParliamentarians bypassing the RDA and takingsubmission directly to the Minister must not be supported There is a need to acknowledge that local business,economic andor community development is more thanjust infrastructure. There is also the softer side of localdevelopment based on skills development, strategydevelopment, targeted research etc etc. The phrase thatcaught the ear of the Parliamentarians was the glue thatholds a community together. We have been challengedto prepare a short paper on this for tabling with theInquiry and Another topic they showed some interest in was having asmuch of a focus on opportunities as we do or need whendesigning and administering a Regional DevelopmentProgram.EDA WA SPN did prepare a formal written response tothe Inquiry, and receipt of this has been acknowledged fromthe Committee, but it has not yet been published on the site.

Ms Allan saysVictoria has already created new regional developmentopportunities from existing major infrastructure projects likethe 688 million WimmeraMallee Pipeline project and the2 billion Food Bowl Modernisation project, which aims toreconfigure the GoulburnMurray irrigation system toreduce water losses.Ms Allan says there is a real opportunity to deliver shortterm construction jobs and longerterm employment as partof the major infrastructure projects expected to becommissioned by the Federal Government in rural Australia.The Regional Development Council has also decided toinvestigate the impact of skills and labour shortages onregional communities and to report on the issue to theCouncil of Australian Governments at its next meeting inOctober 2008.The Federal Government earlier this year announced that theinitial 20 billion earmarked for its Building Australia Fund willOffice energy efficiency program to expand nationallyAn innovative local government program that ishelping commercial office tenants reduce theirgreenhouse gas emissions in the cities of Sydney,North Sydney and Parramatta is to be expandednationally.The CitySwitch Green Office program is now to berolled out in the City of Melbourne, City of Perth,Adelaide City Council, and in metropolitan SydneysWilloughby City Council. It is hoped the nationallyexpanded program will, by 2012, obtain membershipof up to 700 businesses seeking to increase theirenergy efficiency rating and make greenhouse gasemission and cost savings.City of Sydney Lord Mayor, Clover Moore, says if allAustralias commercial office tenants adopted theenergy efficiency changes involved in CitySwitchGreen Office program, it could result in a saving of960,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions perannum.Businesses that join the CitySwitch Green Officeprogram commit to achieving an accredited 4 stars orhigher National Australian Built Environment RatingSystem NABERS Energy tenancy rating.NABERS Energy rates the efficiency of buildings andtenancies from 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars representingexceptional greenhouse performance. As most buildingstock is currently rated as 2.5 stars, each commercialoffice tenant that participates in the program will beencouraged to improve their energy tenancy rating byat least 2 stars.It is estimated that in Sydney alone a 2 star or moreenergy efficiency rating could help businesses tocollectively save about 36.5 million in energy costsand more than 329,000 tonnes of CO2 emissionsevery year.The participation of businesses in Adelaide,Melbourne and Perth in the program could lead tocompanies collectively making energy savings of up to67.3 million annually. More than 60 companies inthe cities of Sydney, North Sydney and Parramattahave joined the program.The national rollout of the CitySwitch Green Officeprogram  which was previously known as the 3CBDsprogram  was coordinated through the Council ofCapital City Lord Mayors.

This approach would ensure theeconomic benefits from the projects are retained in themunicipality.Ararat Rural City Councils Economic DevelopmentManager, Clyde Humphries, says the EconomicDevelopment Unit plans to shortly launch a Buy Localcampaign for small towns in the municipality to encourageresidents to support their local businesses and ensure theirongoing growth. The program will involve theestablishment of advertising stands in local general storeswhere business people can promote their businessesthrough tools such as business cards and pamphlets.Mr Humphries says the Economic Development Unit isalso driving the development of a groundbreaking pilotproject to grow algae for conversion to biofuel. Ifsuccessful, the council will approach local farmers to growalgae in otherwise useless saltwater ponds on theirproperties to provide a supplementary income to theirusual farming activities.The 32,000 pilot project, which has been funded byVictorias local government association, is beingundertaken by the councils Economic Development Unit inconjunction with the North Melbourne Institute of TAFE.The biofuel produced by the algae could also help thecouncil cut its fuel costs by reducing its reliance on fossilfuels to power its vehicle fleet.

The centralbusiness district had declined to the point where it wasconsidered to be a blight on the image and reputation ofthe city and its community. Shops were closing as businesses pulled out. Fortynineper cent of commercial tenancies were vacant. A noted economist remarked at the time that if vacancieshit 50, Gosnells could be regarded as an abovegroundgraveyard. However, the City of Gosnells took the initiative andbecame the driving force behind a project to revitalise thetown centre. The project went on to receive internationalrecognition such was its level of success and innovation. The City became the first Western Australian council andonly the second Australian local authority to win theprestigious Downtown Achievement Award at the 53rdAnnual International Downtown Association Conferenceand World Congress in New York in October 2007.The award was in recognition of the innovation the councilshowed in its efforts to revitalise the Gosnells Town Centre  aproject that now stands as a model for other localgovernments seeking toinvigorate the economic andsocial environment of urbancentres.Undertaking therevitalisation processLocated 17 km southeast ofPerth, the City of Gosnellscovers 127 square km and hasa population of more than95,000.The councils Gosnells TownCentre Revitalisation project isa good example of how theCity has used strong planninginitiatives and sheerdetermination to bring aboutmuchneeded economic andsocial change.The project, which started in the late 1990s, was the firsttime a WA local government had steered an urbanregeneration project of such magnitude.With limited capacity to raise revenue, the City lobbiedState and Federal governments for financial assistance,ultimately converting the citys 5 million startupcontribution into an 80 million government and privatesector investment portfolio.As part of its initial steps to improve the town centreseconomic health, Gosnells became the first localgovernment in Australia to commission an innovative,comprehensive community consultation survey using adynamic process called Simalto.The Simalto survey made it clear the local communitywanted radical action to save the town centre, and so theGosnells Town Centre Revitalisation scheme was born. Under the banner Bright Future the scheme includedplans to improve the Citys civic image, upgradestreetscapes, create better transport and solve traffic andparking problems.  12Volume 2 Number 3MODEL METHODS FOR REVITALISING A TOWN CENTREThe effort of suburban Perth municipality the City of Gosnells to revitalise the economic health of the citys town centrehas not only been a resounding success but stands as a model for other councils seeking to uplift business activity withinurban centres.Pioneer Park, a recently redeveloped area that is proving popular among families.Sustainable economic growth, safety, community focusand access to public services were key factors inaddressing the town centres problems  and today theresa vibrant feel to the new town centre.

Recent mediacoverage has focused on the rollout of a European sharedspace model that civilises streets by mixing pedestrianswith slowmoving traffic and minimal signage. But this is just one outcome of a much broader visionledagenda that has evolved over the past decade.Bendigos current program has emerged through a seriesof incremental and increasingly sophisticated initiativesaimed at supporting and strengthening its traditional citycentre. A cascading set of strategies and aspirations developed with broad community and stakeholder input has reaffirmed the commitment to protect and enhance thecity centre as the primary activity hub of the region,articulating principles and actions to pursue this goal. This has culminated in a bold, widelyagreed vision forthe citys central area that encompasses enhancedprosperity, amenity, activity, sustainability, communityidentity and social inclusion. However, in addition to having an integrated plan,Bendigo has also established an innovative mechanism tosupport integrated delivery.Urban from the startFrom its early days Bendigo has been anurban city, contemporary with theemerging industrial cities of Europe  butset in the bush on the inland foothills ofAustralias Great Divide. This European aspect was reinforced bythe pattern of street and spaces laid out forthe city and the grandeur of high Victorianpublic and private buildings developed latein the nineteenth century. The aggregateeffect of these historic influences has madeBendigo perhaps the most distinctive ofAustralias smaller cities. The wide Pall Mall boulevard definingthe urban heart from elegant Rosiland Parkis lined with grand Victorian public andprivate buildings, culminating in theCharing Cross intersection punctuated bythe Alexandra Fountain and guarded by a platoon ofmercantile premises standing shouldertoshoulder torepresent the importance of their respective institutions.The citys retail and business core is contained betweenPall Mall and the adjacent Bendigo Creek and the railwayline that caps a parallel ridgeline. These physical limits have resulted in a clustered citycentre lining an unusual street grid featuring one curvingstreet with the Victorian grandeur of the Town Hall at itsapex. Supplementing this tight grid is a mesh of shady arcadesand laneways dissecting the principal city blocks at apedestrian scale.Toward the end of the twentieth century the form andspirit of the city centre was bruised and diminished from theloss or defacement of significant buildings in the illconceived quest for modernity, the onslaught of cardomination and the consequences of economic changes. Community spirit was battered and optimism was testedwith the closure of some iconic industries. Disrespect for the citys inherited glories had reached itsextreme in the early 1970s when a proposal to demolishthe mansardroofed grandeur of the Shamrock Hotel wasaverted through the State Government introducing its firstUPLIFTING THE CBD OF A REGIONAL CITYGuided by a sound, integrated vision and using a placebased focus, Victorias City of Greater Bendigo has strengthenedbusiness activity in the citys centre. By Rod Duncan 16Volume 2 Number 3heritage legislation and acquiring the property for interimstewardship. Revival through refurbishmentBy the 1990s, the citys underlying potential wasrecognised and pursued by several pivotal visionarieswhose advocacy and perseverance incrementallyrevitalised public spaces and restored surroundingbuildings. A vigorous program of upgrading public spacesand adjacent private buildings continues. Over 12 km of overhead powerlines, poles andconnecting wires have been gradually removed from thecity skyline, enabling establishment of avenues formed byhundreds of deciduous street trees lining most streets. These trees complement Bendigos seasonality, providingvalued shade during hot summers then revealing the famedsunny, crisp winter days of the inland climate.Footpaths began to be upgraded using a consistent suiteof quality paving materials and elegant street furniture.Over the past decade, more than 10 linear kilometres offootpaths in the city centre have been upgraded, with moresuch works scheduled.Public realm works have been complemented byrefurbishment of prominent public and private buildings. Avariety of programs and mechanisms have been utilised toassist, support and encourage private building owners toreinstate traditional verandas, restore buildings andremove unsightly signage or additions. A bold catalyst project involved public purchase anddemolition of a 1960s motel in a neglected heritage street,enabling expansion of the citys Art Gallery to add acontemporary art wing to its impressive traditionalcollection. This, combined with refurbishment of an adjacent terraceof Victorian shopfronts stepping up View Street, publicrealm improvements and an enlightened exhibitionprogram, has achieved a transformation of the locality. Whilst the sole caf in View Street closed in frustration in1998, in June this year during an exhibition of ArchibaldPrize entries over 40,000 visitors crowded a street linedwith cafs, boutiques and collectables.Activity through qualityFrom the early commitment of an enlightened core, itbecame more widely apparent that attention to amenity,design quality and conservation was proving very effectivein delivering an enhanced urban environment which, inturn, was nurturing and delivering tangible economic,tourism and community benefits. This reflects a global recognition of the changing natureof urban economies, with emergence of knowledgebasedand creative businesses requiring entrepreneurs andemployees whose locational decisions are heavilyinfluenced by personal lifestyle choices. In short, a quality urban environment is a key elementinfluencing future economic health. Regional cities likeBendigo are proving an attractive option to a significantsegment of the growing creative and service economies. Increasingly cosmopolitan, wellconnected withMelbourne and its onward transport linkages, with housinghighly affordable relative to metropolitan areas, the cityhas strong population growth more than 1.5 per annumand has recently topped the 100,000 benchmark.In addition to its 100,000 citizens, it services a similarcatchment population, totalling an aggregate market ofabout 200,000. This gives the city centre an importantadministrative, civic and cultural role in addition to itsdominant position in the business and retail hierarchy.A significant component of the modern Bendigoeconomy is the emergence of its homegrown bank whichhas grown to be a successful leader in the regional bankingsector through innovative business models. The Bendigo Bank is completing construction of a 100million energyefficient headquarters in the heart of the city,counterpointing bold contemporary design with itstraditional setting.A centre of activityWhilst many other cities saw dilution in the importance oftheir traditional hearts through growth of suburbanshopping centres and office parks, in Bendigo theseimpacts were relatively minor and able to be absorbed. Aside from retailing, the city centre is the principal basefor office employment, professional services, culture,entertainment, civic administration, education and health.The city heart provides a strong focus for communityidentity, in turn aiding social inclusion, and is the venue formajor civic events such as the Easter Festival with itsChinese dragon parade.Bendigos city centre is a great example of a multifunctional activity centre  the interdependent cluster ofuses being advocated as the optimal model for urbansustainability in response to the challenges of climatechange and reduced carbon consumption. In 2005 the City of Greater Bendigo engaged itscommunity in a major visioning process known asBendigo 25 to set broad directions and priorities forcoming decades. One outcome was recognition of thepivotal importance of the city centre to the citys economyand identity. Along with a review of commercial land planning, thisstimulated the preparation of an integrated strategy for the 17Volume 2 Number 3city centre. The plan was not restricted to land use orphysical aspects, but took an integrated, crossdisciplinaryperspective embracing economic considerations, eventsand social activity, transport, design quality, communityidentity and inclusion. A joined up approachThe resulting CBD Plan New Visions, New OpportunitiesBendigo CBD Plan, 2005 provides a strong, agreedstatement of the vision for the city centre. The Bendigo CBDPlans key feature is its integrated or joined upperspective. This recognises the inherent interdependencyof urban systems and interventions. It also recognises that the benefits of a multifunctionalcentre can also make some issues and tasks more complexthan the easy but inferior option of monofunctionaldevelopment in greenfield locations. The integrated approach of the planestablishes a common base for reconcilingand resolving such issues, and highlights theresultant benefits. However, the plan alsorecognised that integrated implementationwould also be required for this to beeffectively brokered. A key recommendation of the plan wasestablishment of a place manager role tocoordinate and broker delivery of the vision.In mid2006, assisted by a StateGovernment priming grant, the City ofGreater Bendigo established the City CentreProgram, providing a joined up crossdisciplinary mechanism for coordinatingdelivery of the CBD Plan vision. The program comprises severalcomponents, enhancing internalcoordination amongst municipal functionsand with other public agencies, establishingenhanced relationships with private sectorinterests influencing change investors,landowners, business operators andproviding advocacy for the CBD Plan and itsprinciples, whilst establishing mechanics tosupport these functions.In its initial threeyear pilot phase, the CityCentre Program is utilising an operatingmodel that complements the traditionalsegmented specialist professionals anddivision of responsibilities, adding a holisticplacebased overview for all matters thatinvolve the city centre. Central to the effectiveness of thisapproach is the neutrality of the program within the citysorganisational structure. The Bendigo management structure includes a small CityStrategy directorate providing a highlevel strategicoverview across municipal interests, headed by a Directorpart of the Executive Management Team. Inclusion in this directorate avoids perception of primaryalliance with any of the three major and frequently rivalinterests dominating local government operations land useplanning, economic development and infrastructureprovision. This structural arrangement reinforces that the first loyaltyof the program is to the place the wellbeing andstrengthening of the city centre, and not primarily with any ofthe component professional fields or responsibility groups.Evidence of streetscaping beautification is everywhere, as seen inthis before and after shot. 18Volume 2 Number 3Establishment of a unit specificallydedicated to integrated delivery of an agreedvision for a specific place has resulted inseveral significant changes. It has elevatedadvocacy of the public interest in proposedor desired urban change.The CBD Plan provides a clear, agreedmessage. Through its holistic pursuit, theseinterests are asserted without dilution ordissection that can occur in specialist dealingsrelating to one aspect or step in the changeprocess. The program has enhanced internalcoordination and integration within municipaloperations, exercising legitimacy through therole, and with the CBD Plan in a manner thatdoes not unduly threaten establishedauthority. In its pilot format, the influence of theprogram relies on persuasion through thislegitimacy, rather than any formalisedauthority or referral function that may simply expand thecomplexity that already handicaps integrated decisionmaking. Relationships with the private sector stakeholders havealso been enhanced, with a clearer corporate messageabout expectations and aspirations, and a mechanism thatcan provide coordinated support and facilitation tosignificant projects consistent with the full suite of municipalinterests and objectives. Walk BendigoA highprofile early achievement of Bendigos strategyledapproach is the adoption of a new model for innercitystreets. Within the citys core retail area, the City of GreaterBendigo has committed to a shared space model mixingpedestrians, cyclists and motor vehicles in a lowspeed,highamenity environment with minimised regulation signs,lines and rules. This approach is also known as naked streets and hasseen rapid uptake in northern Europe. The lack of certaintyand quality of surfaces alerts motorists that they aresubservient users of the space, reducing speed andincreasing alertness.Bendigo has adapted the European model to Australiaswide, straight streets streets are about 30 metres betweenbuilding frontages, a common dimension in former Britishcolonies.Fortunately most streets in the retail core are not arterialroutes, so traffic using the centre either has a centraldestination or is taking a shortcut for which there arealternatives. This enables reconfiguration of a network of streets in thecity centre without reducing parking capacity or points ofaccess. This model provides a third option betweenconventional segregation of traffic modes and fullpedestrianisation.Under the banner of Walk Bendigo, this model isguiding a substantial shift of road space from vehicles topedestrians, with enhancement of the additional space tocreate a pleasant, safe and convenient environment forpedestrians  a central objective of the CBD Plan. The additional space is available for expanded onstreetdining, activities and mingling.Adoption of the shared space approach is not simplya traffic management initiative being undertaken inisolation or responding to a specific issue, but is theoutcome of a rigorous strategic process that identified thevision of enhanced pedestrian amenity, then sought amechanism to deliver this consistent with other objectives. This groundwork has achieved broad support for thisinnovative approach and enabled its rapidimplementation, with the first pilot section completed.Guided by a sound, integrated vision and implementedthrough a holistic placebased focus, Bendigo has beenable to improve the quality of outcomes and acceleratedelivery of its objective of strengthening the heart of the cityand region.Bendigos shared space model takes into account all street users.Rod Duncan is Manager of the City CentreProgram at the City of Greater Bendigo.

It was enough to gladden the heart of theshires Business Network Officer.Centred on Echuca, 220km north of Melbourne, the shireis home to just over 38,000 people. With a local economybased on agricultural production, the drought has had amajor impact which has flowed on to other businesses in theregion. Despite this, major retail chains are viewing regionaltowns with an interest that threatens the viability of localstrip shopping centres.Enter Streetlife, the Victorian Government program thataims to revitalise retail shopping strips.The shire gained funding through the program for aproject that ran in 2007, taking in Echuca and the towns ofKyabram, Rushworth, Stanhope and Tongala. Trading groups and Chambers of Commerce needed tothink more strategically in order to stay viable, according toAstrid OFarrell, Business Network Officer for the shire, whoattends their meetings regularly. Many of the groups werestruggling to come up with new ideas, struggling to getpeople to meetings and struggling to be effective, she said. My vision for the project was to reenergise the groupsthrough the introduction of strategyvision and then get afew runs on the board with promotions so that you convertthe cynics  wishful, I know. Initial surveyThe project began with a survey of each businesscommunity. The aim was to gain an understanding of howthey felt about doing business in their locality, and gaugetheir perceptions of the local chamber or trader group. Thesurveys then became the basis of the strategic planningphase of the project. Once each group had adopted its plan, the next stagewas to get the runs on the board necessary to reenthusethe traders. In each location they introduced new andexciting promotions, which have continued since the projectwas finalised.Sixtyfive kilometres southeast of Echuca, Rushworth hasa population of about 1040, and the traders group has 12members out of a possible 44 businesses. Their ShopRushworth and Win promotion ran for a month betweenmidOctober and midNovember 2007. Twenty businesses took part and customers submitted3220 entries representing a minimum spend of 16,100.The traders were delighted with the result and now intend torun it as an annual event.Stanhope, with a population just over 520, has 19members in its Chamber of Commerce out of a possible 22businesses. The consultant recommended a promotionsimilar to Rushworths game, but the Chamber decided ona discount voucher promotion run over one week. The 14 businesses considered suitable for this type ofpromotion all took part. It was not entirely successful.Businesses did not have enough lead time to come up witha good discount and order stock, it was not advertised wellenough to householders, nor run over a long enoughperiod. Nonetheless, the exercise did achieve one very positiveresult  it got the traders working together for the first time. They recognised that they have the ability to run simplepromotions that encourage people to shop locally. And theyall reported that they would take part in another promotionexercise. The networking between businesses stood out asthe most important outcome of the project in all six shoppingareas that took part. The Echuca Moama Business and Trades AssociationEMBTA discovered the benefits of this for the promotion itwas to run in March. Usually EMBTA struggles to getbusinesses involved in a promotion, but for this promotionthey have exceeded their target, said Astrid. There are 76 businesses involved and there were at least10 businesses who would have liked to be involved, butmissed the cutoff. Many of the groups increased theirmembership through the Streetlife program by inviting newbusinesses to become involved. Often youre preaching tothe converted, so new members is a sign of confidence andimproved networking.Despite a renewal of confidence, many groups are stilllooking to the council for motivation and support after theend of the project. The council once had an officer whowas involved with these groups and she ended up runningmany of their promotions and programs. The council foundthat the groups were too reliant on her and needed to takeownership themselves, Astrid said.

Individually, the organisations now partnered inConnecting the Coast had insufficient resources ormotivation to pursue any significant improvement in internetservices for the local area. These groups have worked soeffectively together because the Sunshine Coast RegionalCouncil was able to ensure all their needs were met, andshow that as a coordinated group they could achieve farmore then they could individually. This integrated approach to the development processand the delivery of new telecommunications infrastructure,while being unique for this kind of development project,addresses a common problem for regional economies,where the marketforces do not provide the desired outcomefor communities. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council believes thatConnecting the Coast is the prototype for privatepubliccollaborative projects of this kind, demonstrating theircapacity to innovate and achieve great results for theircommunity.The Sunshine Coast economy is characterised by factorssuch as its small scale, the need for environmentalsensitivity, a service industry base, and high levels ofcreative and cultural value. Within this context, supportingthe knowledge economy is essential to the regions futureprosperity, and resolving issues of connectivity  in terms ofinternet access and stakeholder relationships  is theessential element of the Connecting the Coast project. Delivering worldclass, highspeed broadband atmetropolitan prices will reduce the local economysreliance on more traditional industries such as retail andtourism aid the regeneration of communities which havelost their traditional economic base and enable the futureproofing of the Sunshine Coast region. For example Cooroy, an extimber town of less then7000 residents, has experienced great social andeconomic upheaval in the past six years, with the closureof two mills and several other anchor employment sourcesin town.

Connecting the Coast will enhance network accessthrough a mix of fibre optic cable, the provision of two newnetwork points, new wireless base stations and a new155MBps megabytes per second backhaul link betweenBrisbane and the Sunshine Coast. The combination ofwireless and fibre optic cable provides network securityand redundancy, with the capability to reach over half ofthe Sunshine Coast population and potentially 38,500businesses in the region.Connecting the Coast is creating catalytic change in theregion by supporting local business and innovationencouraging ecommerce on the Sunshine Coast deliveringbenefits to broadband consumers and improving theefficiency of essential services. The Sunshine Coast Regional Council is now looking topromote the use of new services and develop morestrategies for future development, while working with localorganisations to improve access to telecommunications bymandating broadband infrastructure in all newdevelopments.Other regions and levels of government are looking atConnecting the Coast as a template for the development oftelecommunications infrastructure in other regional areas.The Federal Government is interested in the outcomes andis seeking more material on the project from the SunshineCoast Regional Council.Michael Whereat is the  Principal EconomicDevelopment Officer  Telecommunications Professional ServicesEconomic Development Unit Central for theSunshine Coast Regional Council  Ph 07 5441 8481Email Michael.whereatsunshinecoast.qld.gov.auThe Small Towns Victoria Program completed the pilot ofthe Centre for Innovative and Entrepreneurial LeadershipsCIEL Business Vitality Initiative BVI pilot around the stateat the end of June. Mike Stolte, Director of the Canadabased notforprofit CIEL, trained five facilitators fromacross the state to deliver the pilot and possible futureprograms. The piloting of the economic developmentfocused BVI methodology is a first for Australia.The BVI helps townships to assess their capacity tosupport entrepreneurs and to foster small business growth.The BVI measures the perceptions of community leaders,business and industry leaders, education and healthproviders and residents about the current businessenvironment in their town and compares the results to anaverage of other townships to determine possible shortand longterm actions the community can undertake toimprove its business friendliness.The five pilot townships in Victoria Yarram, Dimboola,Myrtleford, Robinvale and Macarthur have each held twotownship meetings  the first with a small representativegroup and the second with the greater township  and arenow in the throes of delivering their selected actions. In the first meeting, business and community leaders metand considered each towns capacity to work withentrepreneurs and foster business growth. The townshipwas assessed through an intensive, one hundredquestionsurvey along with some group discussion work. The second meeting was a focus and action sessioninvolving the entire community. Each facilitator presentedfindings from the surveys completed and discussion groupsthat took place in the first session, along with someproposed actions. Everybody was asked to vote on theactions they believe to be of priority for the township.Following the prioritysetting exercise, the attendees selfselect an action work group to join. A reality check isperformed in the work groups in order to see if currentresources, energy and circumstances will allow thetownship to move forward with their selected priorityactions. All the pilot townships have the support of the trainedfacilitators over the next six months to support them, andtheir community sponsor the Economic DevelopmentOfficer from the local council in most cases.Full reports, summary reports and selectedactions from each pilot township are availableon the Small Towns section of the MunicipalAssociation of Victoria websitehttpwww.mav.asn.auecdrrdsmalltowns Business Vitality Initiative pilot  24Volume 2 Number 3PLANNING FOR A GLOBAL ECONOMYThe Scoresby Rowville Employment Precinct SREP,located in the City of Knox in Melbournes outer east, is apatch of land to keep an eye on. The area is a case studyof efforts to create a high technology, mixed use, highamenity precinct with a global reach. Whilst much of the surrounding regional industrialparcels comprise old economy businesses, the vision forthe SREP is to foster cutting edge businesses competing ina global environment within a high amenity, mixed usesetting. The evolution of the Precinct also providesimportant lessons on the links between planning controlsand economic development.The SREP covers approximately 241 hectares of landbounded by Ferntree Gully Road, Stud Road, WellingtonRoad and the new major road infrastructure in the region,Eastlink. The SREP has ample vacant land much of it in oneownership, sympathetic planning controls, many majorglobal companies, an emerging high technology businesscluster, sweeping views of the Dandenong Ranges, is nextto Eastlink and the Dandenong Valley Parklands, is in closeproximity to the Synchrotron in Clayton and adjacent toCouncils 50 hectare historic landholding, Stamford Park anew regional park in the making and nearby strategicredevelopment sites.Now the above may sound like a real estate pitch or awellhoned spiel from councils investment attraction officer.True  however a straight description of these attributesdoesnt reveal the challenges faced to date and thoseahead to realise the vision for the Precinct.Challenges for industryA key reason for councils support for the SREP is setagainst a backdrop of Australian business needing tobecome more global in outlook. Council wants to helpsecure businesses and investment that can compete withregions the world over. Research commissioned by councilundertaken by SGS Economics and Planning in 2000found that Knox and the region is not well represented byadvanced manufacturing and advanced business services. Many of the latter are concentrated in the inner city. Withtraditional manufacturing increasingly moving offshoreone of the regions key economic drivers, bold steps wererequired.This background research, which formed the basis formoving the Precinct forwards, found that many businessesoperating in the area had a global reach in research,manufacturing, administration and distribution activity. Thissuccess was attributed to a combination of location i.e. itis wellconnected to markets and workforce and site factorsi.e. suitable facilities and space in a high amenity settingfor a competitive price. Council used this as evidence tosupport the establishment of the SREP. Council argued thatthe specialisation of the Precinct in the global chain ofproduction was likely to be strongest in research,technology, regional distribution and industry.The Carribbean GroupThe Caribbean Group is the largest single land ownerwithin the SREP and has ample vacant land for futuredevelopment. The Group is the builder, developer,financier and longterm property owner of all buildingswithin the Caribbean Business Park. The Group has heldthe land since 1942 and is planning for the next stage ofthe Caribbean Business Parks development. This stage will consist of office towers overlooking thenetwork of lakes including the 20ha Lake Caribbean. Thedevelopment will have an emphasis on parkland and staffamenities, such as cafes, walking paths, exercise points,open space and greenery. All of the office buildings will bedesigned with the very latest building materials focusing onGreen Star principles.One of the exciting tenants of the Caribbean BusinessPark is MiniFab. This micronano biocompany createsadvanced products using unique scientific, engineeringand manufacturing knowhow. Its business is the design,integration and manufacture of polymer micro and nanoengineered systems for a wide range of industries, with afocus on biotechnology, health, agriculture, food andenvironmental sectors. It has customised GMP productioncleanrooms. MiniFab works with clients to develop product strategies,create manufacturing methods, and provide manufacturingsolutions from prototyping to batch scale manufacturing forregular compliance testing to volume manufacturing. TheCaribbean Group is one of a number of financial backers ofMiniFab and its 2002 establishment is evidence of a visionto steer the SREP towards more knowledgebased enterprise.Recognising the international challenges on local industry, Knox Council in eastern Melbourne is supporting efforts toattract knowledge based enterprise into one of the areas key commercial precincts. Grant Meyer outlines Knox Councilsadvocacy for changes in planning schemes to reflect the need to attract businesses which can succeed in the globaleconomy. By Grant Meyer 25Volume 2 Number 3The Knox Planning SchemeIn 2004, council was successful in having the SREP formallyrecognised in the Knox Planning Scheme AmendmentC22. This involved the employment land in the Precinctbeing rezoned from Industrial to Business. Thesignificance of this was to make it easier for new economyenterprises such as MiniFab to establish in the precinct. Inother words, encouraging the shift from the strong existingwarehousing and industry to more knowledgebasedenterprises.As part of Amendment C22, State Government placed acap of 20,000 sqm on standalone office floorspace withinthe Business 3 Zone schedule of SREP land. This was basedon their concerns that the Precinct was not well serviced bypublic transport and that stand alone office activities shouldbe located within designated Activity Centres. This was adisappointment to key landowners and Council and servedto inhibit the type of investment described in the vision forthe Precinct that was at the very heart of councils 2004Planning Scheme Amendment request.2008 Planning Scheme ChangesFour years passed and views within State Governmentmoderated. In May 2008, following advocacy from Counciland landowners, the Victorian Planning Minister removed acap on freestanding office floorspace of 20,000 squaremetres in the Precinct Amendment C73 to the KnoxPlanning Scheme.In terms of arguing the case for loosening the planningcontrols for the SREP, council put the following arguments toState Government There will be a substantial amount of additional officefloorspace required all over Melbourne. It cant all beaccommodated within designated existing ActivityCentres The SREP is on the Principal Public Transport Network andis serviced by the State Governments recently launchedSmart Bus route on Stud Road The Caribbean Business Park, which is a key landholdingon the SREP, should in time be a future Major ActivityCentre because of its employment significance andcapacity for future mixed use activities Its important that State Government gets a return on itsinvestment from the new Eastlink Tollway infrastructure The requirements of industry are changing and the KnoxPlanning Scheme needs to adapt The SREP should have a broad range of uses e.g.childcare, personal services, convenience, retail,hospitality and accommodation to make it a true ActivityCentre as defined by the Melbourne 2030 MetropolitanPlanning Strategy The landowners should be able to develop a substantialamount of future office floorspace in order to help arguethe case for a significant range of complimentaryinfrastructure and quality design Its likely that some of the existing warehouse functions onsite will be replaced over time as the balance of vacantland in the SREP is developed. Increasing land values willonly help to support these transitions and New development in the SREP should comprise highquality design with a big emphasis on ESD. Council was formally notified by the Minister forPlanning, Justin Madden, in a letter dated 7 May 2008,that he had prepared, adopted and approved AmendmentC73 to the Knox Planning Scheme. The Amendment Removed the restriction on the amount of officedevelopment that can be provided in the ScoresbyRowville Employment Precinct Deleted the requirement for offices to be used inconjunction with the industrial and other commercial useswithin the Precinct Simplified controls applying to the Precinct Specified that the future Neighbourhood Activity Centre isto be located within the vicinity of the current market siteand  Removed the prohibition on access to and from Eastlink. Of significance, the Minister provided his inprincipleendorsement of the Precinct being given future Melbourne2030 Major Activity Centre status. Key land owners arenow working closely with council and other relevantauthorities in preparing a Development Plan for the land toensure that it achieves its full potential as a major centre foremployment.The Ministers announcement is a very positive outcomeand follows extensive efforts by council going back overmany years. The freeing up of the planning controlsremoves a significant barrier to substantial new investmentand is consistent with the policy intent of councils recentlyadopted Knox Economic Development Strategy 2008 2018. It is also consistent with the 11 Council MelbourneSouth East Regional Economic Development Strategy Prosperity for the Next Generation, driven by theMelbourne South East group, of which Knox is a member.Stamford ParkPart of councils vision and interest in the SREP can be foundnext door. Adjacent to the SREP is councils Stamford Parksite comprising approximately 50ha, located on Stud RoadRowville, just north of the Stud Park Shopping Centre. The 26Volume 2 Number 3site is bordered by the Kingston Links Golf Course andRowville residential area to the south, the Kingsley Closeindustrial estate to the north and Corhanwarrabul Creekand Caribbean Gardens Estate to the west. Council recognises the need for a mix of communityrecreation, leisure and housing uses on site. In time it will bea major regional park. Melbourne Water and Parks Victoriahave committed substantial funds towards wetlands andshared paths. Discussions have commenced with thetraditional owners of the land and many local people areinvolved in the sites planning. Development and activitieson site will take place in an environmentally sustainableway. Stamford Park presents an ideal opportunity toachieve these aims in a way that captures the communitysinput and imagination.ConclusionIn summary, the SREP is an exciting economic developmentproject being pursued by council in partnership withlandowners, investors and State Government. The projecthas a big focus on creating a high amenity area with acomplementary mix of activities and uses.The close proximity of the SREP to Eastlink, access to askilled labour force, abundant land, willing investors, theSynchrotron and accompanying scientific community in theadjoining City of Monash are helping the stars to align inthis part of south eastern Melbourne.Commitment on the part of key landowners has provencrucial and councils advocacy together with StateGovernment support will now help to realise the vision forthe Precinct.Grant Meyer is the Coordinator PlaceManagement at Knox City Council.

The USbased Oregon Council for Knowledge andEconomic Development defines a knowledge economy asone where the keys to wealth and job creation are theextent to which ideas, innovation and technology areembedded in all sectors. Consistent across these andother definitions of a knowledge economy is thatknowledge is not a separate sector of the economy butinstead, is a pervasive input to all industries.Nevertheless, some industries have strongerknowledge traits than others. The QueenslandGovernment for example defines knowledgebasedindustries by the Australia and New Zealand StandardIndustrial Classification ANZSIC by utilising the OECDsScience, Technology and Industry Scoreboard. In thisframework knowledge based industries are those that arerelatively intensive in their inputs of technology and humancapital. Chief among these industries are aerospace,chemicalsbiotechnology, ICT equipment and services,and consumer electronics. In addition, there are a numberof knowledge intensive sectors in the servicestertiarysector of economies Queensland Government, 2005.The Queensland Government goes a step further thandefining knowledgebased industries by prioritising themin its economic development and strategic planning policyframeworks. A key economic development planningprinciple 9.1 of the South East Queensland Regional Planis to develop a diversified regional economy,characterised by knowledgebased, high valueaddingindustries that build on existing regional and subregionalcompetitive advantages and specialisations QueenslandGovernment, SEQ Regional Plan, 2005. Specific policies contained in the SEQ Regional Planinclude a desire to refine and implement subregionaleconomic development strategies that deliver high valueadded jobs and build knowledgebased industries, and totarget development of high valueadded and knowledgebased industries in the SEQ region.The original knowledgebased industry listing sourcedfrom the Queensland Government has been expanded bySGS Economics and Planning to incorporate the growingservices sector especially business, health and educationservices, key resource and agricultural subsectors suchas technical and specialist services to mining andagriculture, additional advanced manufacturing sectorslike machinery and equipment manufacturing and thecreative industries like film, entertainment software, musicand design. This broadens the research and technologyemphasis of industries that are considered to beknowledgebased. The list of knowledgebased industries by 4digitANZSIC classification is extensive over 85 individualindustry classifications in all. Therefore, in order to profilea regions knowledgebased industries, SGS Economicsand Planning has grouped the 4digit ANZSICclassifications into five broad segments based on logicalgroupings of related industry sectors. The five knowledgebased industry segments, which can typically be used toprofile the knowledgebased industry propensity of anyregion or locale are1. Advanced Manufacturing2. Scientific  Technical Services to Agriculture andMining3. Advanced Business Services4. Advanced Health  Education Services and5. Cultural  Recreational Services.As Professor Michael Porter, the originator of theeconomic cluster term has been quoted as saying onnumerous occasions, there are no low tech industries,only low tech firms. This reiterates the notion that allindustry sectors can potentially engage with and becomean integral component of a knowledge economy.Knowledge is Fundamental for Economic SuccessBut why are knowledge economies KBEs and knowledgebased industries KBIs so prominent in recent economicdevelopment theory and practice This can best beillustrated by two things  data which demonstrates therecent comparatively high rates of growth of local andregional economies with a high knowledge contentThere is a rapidly growing realisation that future prosperity will depend on how successfully regions and cities can attractand cultivate knowledgebased businesses. By Sasha Lennon 28Volume 2 Number 3relative to those without and international literature, basedon empirical evidence, which advocates the fundamentalimportance of knowledge economies in the late 20th andearly 21st Centuries.With respect to the latter, a number of prominentresearch reports prepared in recent years have linkedknowledge with economic development. For example The OECD 1998, p.4 in Technology, Productivity andJob Creation concluded that longterm growth rates inOECD economies depend on maintaining andexpanding the knowledge base, while making it moreresponsive to economic and social needs The OECDs 2002 Science, Technology, and IndustryOutlook found that growth in real value added forknowledge industries was consistently greater thanoverall growth rates for OECD member countries The World Bank 1998, p.16 in its World DevelopmentReport Knowledge for Development, stated thattodays most technologically advanced economies aretruly knowledgebased creating millions ofknowledgerelated jobs in an array of disciplines thathave emerged overnight and The Queensland Government is aware of the need totap into the knowledge economy and states thatknowledges strength is such that those countries whichadapt most readily and exploit the opportunities offeredby the knowledge driven economy will enjoy risingincomes and prosperity while those which lag behindmay face relative economic decline QueenslandGovernment, Department of State Development, 2005,p.2.Characteristics of Knowledge EconomiesSo what is it that differentiates a knowledge economy fromresource and productionbased economies and what sortsof attributes should cities and regions be nurturing andpromoting in order to facilitate the growth anddevelopment of their local knowledge economies Usingthe definitions referred to previously, it is considered thatthere are a number of key traits that are indicative of aknowledge economy, including A strong education  research presence collaboration between educationresearch institutionsand industry that results in the commercialisation of theirjoint work Industry Clusters  Networks  the formation ofinterdependent but competitive organisations that shareresearch and knowledge, trade goods and services,share lifestyle facilities and have a common pool ofknowledge workers Strong Innovation  Technology UptakeAcross the Economy  knowledge and technology isdiffused throughout the entire economy and not justselected industry sectors A Strong Local Industry Base  a knowledgeeconomy is built upon the existing economic strengths ofthe region High Levels of Trade Exports  businesses havean export orientation and awareness of new and betterways of producing goods and services Smart Infrastructure and Technology  aknowledge economy will, by nature, be a competitiveeconomy that is attractive for investment and Knowledge Workers  the economy is characterisedby a skilled and adaptable workforce, that is, peoplewho are able to sell their skills and expertise on theglobal market.While the literature on knowledge economies is vastand evolving such that efforts to pin down definitions ordraw boundaries are contestable, key themes do exist. Indefining the term knowledge economy it must berecognised that knowledge is applicable at every stageof a regions economic valueadded process. Importantly,for developed regional economies, knowledge isfundamental for economic growth.Knowledge Economy Differentiators  Seven Elements of SuccessWith these characteristics in mind, for local and regionalagents of change including the economic developmentunits of Councils, regional development organisations andothers looking to facilitate the sustainable economicFigure 1. Knowledge Based Industry SegmentsSource SGS Economics and Planning 29Volume 2 Number 3development of their regions, knowledgebased industriescan be nurtured by those willing to invest in and promotekey knowledge economy differentiators. These are thecritical attributes that KBIs and knowledge workers lookfor when making investment location decisions. Theyinclude1. Accessibility to quality education institutions forongoing skills development generating a highincidence of scientific and professional skills and asecure supply of technicaltrade skills2. An open, tolerant and supportive business culture thatpromotes competition, collaboration, entrepreneurship,risk taking, and openness to new ideas3. Infrastructure, that is, infrastructure items that supportbasic production processes such as transport,information technology  telecommunicationsincluding high speed broadband and facilities thatare supportive of the incubation of businesses and theefficient and effective commercialisation of ideas4.

Connectedness, that is, links between the regionsbusiness sector, government, its research and itseducational institutions to match the local skills flowwith regional requirements, and active networking withother worldwide knowledgebased centres.These are important considerations in planning forknowledge economy growth and development in urbanand regional Australia.ReferencesOECD 2002, The KnowledgeBased Economy, InScience, Technology, and Industry Outlook, ParisOECD 1998, Technology, Productivity and Job CreationBest Policy Practice, ParisPorter, M.E. 1996 Competitive Advantage,Agglomeration Economies and Regional Policy, inInternational Regional Science, 19 1  2 pp. 8594Queensland Government Office of Urban Managementand South East Queensland Regional Organisation ofCouncils June 2005, South East Queensland RegionalPlan 20052026 Queensland Government Department of StateDevelopment and Innovation 2005, KnowledgeBasedIndustries, Internal Working Paper, BrisbaneQueensland Government Department of Premier andCabinet 2005, Definition of Knowledge Intensive Exports,Internal Working Paper Trade Division, BrisbaneState Science and Technology Institute, 2006, AResource Guide for Technologybased Economic Development,viewed 18th October 2007httpwww.ssti.orgPublicationsOnlinepubsresourceguide.pdfWorld Bank 1998, World Development ReportKnowledge for Development, Washington DCSasha Lennon is a Brisbanebased Director ofnational consultancy firm SGS Economics andPlanning Pty Ltd.

The City of Greater Bendigos BusinessDevelopment Unit had established strong links with theBendigo Manufacturing Group, a coalition of the citys mainmanufacturing and mining industries which inject anestimated 2.2billion into the local economy and whoselivelihood is vital to the region.It was through this forum that electricity pricing arose asa matter of key concern, especially to those keen to promoteeconomic development in the region.Our first study in 2005 of 27 businesses spread across 30sites around central Victoria found they could shave 1.5million from their collective annual electricity bill of 12.3million just by improved tendering, negotiations andmanagement practices. But in the course of this study wediscovered significant differences between city and countrynetwork electricity pricing and decided to investigate further.The Business Development Unit dug deep and found thatwhen the national electricity market was established in2005, a fund was set up to research the impact ofprivatisation on domestic and commercial consumers inrural and regional Australia.The City subsequently became the first municipality to tapthis and, equipped with 70,000 and with support from theBendigo Manufacturing Group, commissioned consultantsKPMG to look into those price differences.The studys final report, released in May this year, showedthat nationally, country network electricity prices are alreadyup to 40 higher than in metropolitan areas. In Victoriacountry prices are 19 to 30 higher than in Melbourne.What we also discovered was that the difference will widenin some areas. For example subsidies, specifically theTransmission Equalisation Adjustment or TEA which wascreated to account for network cost differences whenVictorias power infrastructure was sold off in the 1990s, willwind down by 2020. As a result country users will be payinga further 410 more than their city counterparts.The studys findings shocked us but the feeling from otherregional centres was not to draw attention to the matter.They were frightened wed scare business from regionalareas. This is not our intention, but after long deliberationswe realised regional Australia had to draw attention to andaddress this difference to remain competitive locations forbusiness. The other point, of course, is that many regionalbusinesses invest nationally across state borders and to limitthe study to one state would have ignored this fact. The KPMG study, called the National Electricity EquityBusiness Project examined the electricity bills over 12months from November 2005 of 10 businesses in 27locations spread throughout Victoria, NSW, Queenslandand South Australia. The sites included a fast foodrestaurant, a supermarket, schools ranging from small tolarge, a small and a multistorey office block, as well ashospitals and manufacturing plants, both large and small.It clearly identified the source of the cost differencesbetween city and country, differences which have becomeclearer as Australias electricity supply industry becomesmore costreflective. The sources of those differences are nothard to imagine. There are network line losses. As electricitytravels down the line from the point of transmission tocustomers it meets greater resistance and is dissipated.There is the cost of maintaining poles and power linesand with less customers on rural and regional extensions,they are more costly to maintain. This density of distributionfactor means a highly urbanised population centre will havemore customers per kilometre of network and thereforelower costs per customer.Also, townships further from generation sources requirelong transmission lines, thereby driving up costs.Recognising this, a whole series of pricing equalisation orsubsidy schemes have been in place. But what is happeningwith Victorias TEA, is that this equalisation strategy is beingwound down. The impact of TEAs eventual removal will befelt in the network charge component of electricity pricing.An electricity bill is typically made up of energy, network,and other charges.Our NEE study found that the removal of the TEA on a lowvoltage customer such as a small manufacturing business inregional Victoria using around 1.4million kilowatt hours kWhwill boost its annual network charge by 1000 or about 1.6while the same business in metropolitan Melbourne will pay1000 less. The 2000 difference means the network chargeis about four per cent more in regional Victoria.For a high voltage manufacturing customer in regionalVictoria using, say nine million kilowatt hours annually, theblowout is higher, about 15,000 more, incurring networkcharges that are 10 more than an equivalent business inMelbourne. In this article, Brian Gould, the manager of the business development unit at the City of Greater Bendigo, arguesthat a governmentfunded Regional Network Fund would shore up business investment in regional Australia and helpclose the widening gap in network electricity prices between metropolitan and regional areas. 31Volume 2 Number 3Network charges are already significantly higher inregional areas across most of regional Australia. The same low voltage business customer in regionalVictoria already pays 19 more for their network chargethan their Melbourne counterpart. In NSW, regionalnetwork charges are 28 higher than in Sydney and inQueensland theyre 43 higher than in Brisbane. Our highvoltage nine million kilowatt hour manufacturer would alsobe much better off in those cities than regional areas wherethe annual network charges would be 31, 51 and 29higher respectively.All this should make disturbing reading for those keen toboost development in regional Australia. Copies of theNEE report are downloadable from the Key Strategies andProjects section at www.businessbendigo.com.auIn interviews conducted as part of the study, it was interestingto see that ninety per cent of businesses included in the studyknew about the different components of their electricity bills.Ninety per cent of them also knew about the network chargesthat apply to their business but far fewer knew about unwindingsubsidies and their potential impact on their businesses. Nineof them, for example, had sites in Victoria and of these only oneknew about the TEA or its unwinding.Half the businesses listed either tradition or history as thefactor that most influenced their location. Theyd been there50 to 100 years. Three said access to customers wasimportant. Two said access to suppliers and raw materialswas a significant consideration and four said electricitycosts were not a key consideration but given many areoperating in the dark when it comes to looming changes tonetwork charges, thats not unusual. Its likely that heightened awareness of these impendingchanges could make a difference to where they decide tolocate in the future. Do we wait until they find out and leave,or do we get out there and argue the merits for regionaldevelopment of addressing and minimising these differencesFor me, and the community I serve, the answer to that isunequivocal. We have to get out there and argue the case forbusiness development in regional Australia like crazy.This is what our Business Development Unit is now doing.Weve taken our case to Regional Cities Victoria, theMunicipal Association of Victoria and were now beginningto be heard at national conferences, the most recent beingthe Sustainable Economic Growth for Regional Australiaconference in Albury. The Ministerial Council on Energyand the Australian Energy Market Commission are our nextpoints of call but we need the might and power of all ofregional Australia behind this.The solution we are suggesting is outlined in the NEEreport. And it goes like this.We propose that governments  federal and state establish a Regional Network Fund overseen by a board. Itwould do two things. The first is to pay for any unplannedupgrading  extension of the distribution network wherecommunity benefits have been identified. Communitybenefits could be measured in the form of increasedemployment, increased economic output etc. Accordingly,the investment in such infrastructure would encouragedevelopment in regional Australia.The second is to subsidise businesses investing in new orexpanded commercial developments in regional areas sothat their capital contribution costs for the additional lineand services required are reduced. This would help offsetthe greater network charges they face for investing inregional areas and reduce the risk to networks that existingcustomers might leave or downsize.A Regional Network Fund would operate outside themarket. It would not, for instance, ask metropolitancustomers in urbanised areas with lower network charges tosubsidise regional customers as has happened in the past.But it would prevent businesses leaving regional economiesand support regional economies by providing jobs andwider economic growth.Such a fund might also offer serendipitous opportunitiesfor developing other forms of energy at strategic locationsin regional areas.It we are to retain, attract and grow business in theregions, citycompetitive energy prices, i.e. those that aremore equitable and fairer, are essential. Now its up toregional groups across Australia including councils,regional development associations and business advisorygroups to argue the case and convince all levels ofgovernment and the wider community that this is so.Brian Gould is leading the call for a Regional Network Fundto counter rising electricity prices in regional Australia.To contact Brian Gould, Ph 03 5434 6137Email b.gouldBendigo.vic.gov.au 32Volume 2 Number 3ECO BUSINESS IS SMART BUSINESSThe Eco Business program was born out of researchfindings that revealed that small to medium enterpriseswere often very high energy users. A lack of knowledge onenergy minimisation strategies, and being unaware of theirenvironmental impact, were regarded as being the mainreasons for this statistic. As a result, the Eco Business program was developed,combining technical data with broader social marketingtechniques to educate participants. Practical action plansare provided to these participants that can lead to newbehaviours, greenhouse gas abatements, and costefficiency.What is an Eco Business An Eco Business is a businessthat has a holistic view of their workplace and, whilst beingprofit driven, is equally conscientious about the impact ofits business on the environment, local community and thesociety in which it operates.The EcoBusiness Program is a direct outcome of the Cityof Joondalups approach to ensuring it addresses theimpact both it  and the local community  has on theenvironment. This has principally been driven throughparticipation in the Cities for Climate Protection program.It has now achieved stage 5 and is proceeding with theadvanced stages through CCP Plus accreditation. The EcoBusiness Program was first initiated as a pilotproject by the City of Joondalup and was later extended inpartnership with the Cities of Wanneroo and Stirling. Otherkey partners included sustainability specialists EcoSmartPrograms, the Australian Greenhouse Office AGO, andthe AusIndusty BESB program.The pilot program, developed in partnership withEcoSmart Programs, provided 30 local businessassessments that translated into 1195 of energy savingsper business on average and a reduction of 6.2 TonnesCO2 per annum for the businesses. A second program wasimplemented during 2007 for 75 businesses across theregion. In November 2007 the Program partners received198,000 in further funding which saw an additional 225businesses participate in the Program in the Joondalup andWanneroo region.The initial pilot project was funded entirely by the City ofJoondalup. The extension of the program, which providedan additional 75 business assessments, was cofunded bythe Australian Greenhouse Office along with contributionsfrom the Cities of Joondalup, Wanneroo and Stirling. Themost recent program has received funding from the FederalGovernment through the AusIndusty BESB program. The Eco Business Program provides an assessment,mentoring, recognition and community aware system thatprovides an efficient and effective way for Small to MediumEnterprises SMEs to improve their environmentalperformance. A core component is the evaluation systemdeveloped by EcoSmart Programs Small to MediumEnterprise SME business assessment and energymanagement methodology. This provides SMEs with a userfriendly and streamlinedactionable report Energy Action Plan, based ondata collected from a standardised assessment toolquestionnaire. This data is used to compute thebusiness energy profiles, energy savings potential,action plan and simple payback on energyefficiency options for decisionmaking and ease ofreference, based on the Program stages Scope Development Determine the scope ofthe assessment and the organisationalrequirements Energy Assessment Stage determine GHGemissions  Water and Waste Assessment Determinehow much water is used and how much waste isgenerated as well as any recycling activitiesundertaken Energy Action Plan Practical plan targetinga.

This was followed up byan onsite rating to determine the implementation ofthe action plan over a set time periodapproximately 612 weeks and identify the relevantEco Business Rating that was achieved.A key innovation of the program is the mentoringassistance and a community awareness campaign.The mentoring component helps businesses make thenecessary changes that minimise their greenhousegas emissions. The awareness campaign runsalongside the program to promote environmental themes tothe broader community and generate consumer demandfor participating Eco Businesses. The Programs website isfundamental to this outcome  www.ecobusiness.net.auThe Eco Business Program has been highly successful inincreasing energy awareness and savings among all of the184 businesses that have participated to date. It haspromoted energy efficiency by identifying what theaverage small business can do about reducing energyconsumption. Primarily this has been achieved through theenergy assessment process and the provision of acustomised Energy Action Plan delivered by projectpartners EcoSmart Programs.The measurable outcomes achieved by the Programthrough the 184 Action Plans were delivered. Collectively, thePlans identified a 10.5 reduction on annual energyconsumption, which translates into annual cost savings of307,430 and annual GHG abatements of 12,580 tonnesCO2. This represents an average reduction of 6380kWh perbusiness.Continual improvement is demonstrated by the growth inscope of the Eco Business Program. The focus of the Pilotwas to increase baseline awareness of energy issues,ostensibly through the structured Audit and Energy Plan.However, the most recent iteration of the Program hastargeted broader community education and included abasic system of accreditation for participating businesses.The principle stakeholders involved in the Eco BusinessProgram are primarily the participating business owners ormanagers who have the greatest interest in developingsustainable practices and in promoting themselves asenvironmentally aware. The key benefits of participating within the Eco BusinessProgram can be summarised into the following areas  Reducing energy costs  Includes costs associatedwith electricity, gas, travel, water and waste Reducing environmental impact  Reducinggreenhouse gas emissions and their contribution toclimate change Allowing businesses to differentiatethemselves  Businesses can use Eco Businessbranding in their advertising and promotions to appealto environmentally conscious consumers Leveraging community promotion  Businessesbenefit from a community awareness campaign designedto increase knowledge of local environmental issues andcrosspromote the Eco Business brand particularly throughthe Programs website  www.ecobusiness.net.au  Individualised Energy Action Plans  Onsiteevaluation of the business to maximise environmentalperformance and cost savings Oneonone mentoring support  Handsonsupport from Eco Business energy consultants and Information seminars  Latest information onmanagement practices, energy reduction, water use,waste management and transport.Secondary benefits of the Program have been togenerate extended behaviour change within thehouseholds of the employees and owners of the businessparticipants. At the community level that ProgramsCommunity Awareness Campaign has raised generalawareness within the community in regards to sustainablelifestyles. Through the Programs website the community isable to act on this sentiment to identify local Eco Businessbusinesses.For further information please contact BradCrooks at the City of Joondalup Ph 08 94004544 or at brad.crooksjoondalup.wa.gov.auRhonda Hardy, Manager Strategic Development, openingMentoring and Graduation session. 34Volume 2 Number 3VISION OF A SMART, SUSTAINABLE CITY Greater Springfield is one of the largest master plannedcommunities in the western world and the fastest growing inAustralia. So far 2.2 billion of development has beencompleted, representing only 11.5 of the total planned.Each year there is more than 600 million in developmentactivity under way as Greater Springfield gears up to caterfor an equivalent population of 105,000 by the year 2030. When we first set out to create a master plannedcommunity in the Western Corridor more than 16 yearsago, South East Queensland did not have a good trackrecord in urban planning. Many developers were gainingapproval for new suburban areas that mushroomed on theoutskirts of Brisbane, despite the obvious lack of properservices and infrastructure. Today many of these developments have been labelledby local authorities and planning bodies as poorlyplanned and they still lack vital services. The old saying ifyou fail to plan, you plan to fail is true of these areas andmany are now the focus of studies showing this kind ofurban sprawl creates illhealth and financial strain. If there is little or no infrastructure, facilities, retail or localjobs, people are forced to rely on their car to get to wherethey need to go. In communities where there is little or nowalkability people tend to lead sedentary lifestyles andhave to spend more on petrol, which in turn puts pressureon the family budget. These tougher economic times,together with some poor development outcomes in the past,have swung the spotlight onto the importance of properplanning. Working locally, living locally is the new mantra in a carbonconstrained world. Reducing travelling time and carbonexpenditure is an urgent priority for planners. One of the largest urban developments in Australia  the City of GreaterSpringfield in south eastern Queensland  is based on creating an integrated, holistic urbansphere where work, educationand living are brought together. The founder of Greater Springfield, Dr Maha Sinnathamby, outlines his visionin this article.Aerial image showing current status of the development taken April 2008 35Volume 2 Number 3Often we have to experience the consequences ofinaction before we understand the value in taking the rightsteps in the first place. Over the past few years globalwarming, prolonged drought and unseasonal, at timesdevastating, weather, have taught us about planning fornature and environmental sustainability.Now with the worlds economic woes wiping hundredsof billions of dollars off financial markets and theunprecedented high cost of depleting oil stocks, there isevidence both environmental, social and economicsustainability have to be primary considerations in goodplanning. If we knew our dams were going to run dry wewould have planned for better water management a lotsooner. If we knew petrol would surge towards 2.00 alitre, we might have bought the car with the smaller engine. They say hindsight has 2020 vision. We maintainforesight can be just as clear and far more powerful.Planning Greater Springfield was and continues to beabout planning for the future. Our aim is to create a citythat offers the best in lifestyle an integrated community thatoffers jobs, education, health and great liveability for105,000 future residents and workers, all of itunderpinned by technology. One of the key enabling projects for Greater Springfieldwas the decision to install dark fibre access to Brisbane CBD,to support education as a cornerstone of this development. Ifknowledge and information is power, then instant access toservices, such as a highspeed information and technologysuper highway, will certainly benefit all in Springfield. Everyone connected, all of the time, to an environmentwhere residents and businesses use connectivity toconverse, solve problems, share knowledge, conductbusiness, learn and teach. At the heart of technologyinfrastructure in Greater Springfield is the 232 millionplus fivestorey Polaris Data Centre, delivered inpartnership with Suncorp. The most high tech data centreever built in Australia, this Tier 3 IT storage facility willprovide a climate controlled and secure environment toprovide the highest level of support to bluechiporganisations. The Data Centre will house Greater Springfields ICTinfrastructure and avoid the need for allocating this space incommercial buildings. All buildings will be directlyinterlinked so telecommunication costs within Springfieldbecome virtually non existent. Construction of the worldclassPolaris Data Centre is due for completion at the end of2008. In addition to the Polaris Data Centre, Springfields CBDwill offer a range of working environments, including thecitys first high rise office building, Springfield Tower, whichhas just been completed. The Tower is a 4.5 Green Starbuilding and comprises approximately 10,000 squaremetres of AGrade office space. Health CityWhile technology is vital, at the core of the GreaterSpringfield concept is health and education. Recently weannounced our plan for health services, Health City, whichhas potential to become the blueprint for health reformacross Australia. Based on a model developed by worldrenowned Harvard Medical International HMI, HealthCity adopts principles of developing partnerships with allstakeholders and service providersthrough all health care services andinfrastructure which includesinnovative technology andmanagement approaches. The HMI model describes aHealth City with a privatepublicpartnership that would establish acomprehensive health and wellnesscampus, all forms of health care,integrated residential, education,research and ehealth. MaterHealth Services and the Universityof Queensland are already majorpartners for Greater SpringfieldsHealth City.In coming months, constructionwill begin on Stage One of agreenfield site at a cost of morethan 200 million. Oncecompleted Health City will feature450,000 square metres ofAn artists impression of Springfield Central  Greater Springfields developingCBD, as it may look in 2026 36Volume 2 Number 3integrated health care services including primary care,acute care, alternative care, aged care, retirement livingand hotels. Once established it will have a daytimeworkforce of 12,000 people and a night time workforce of8000. Education CityResearch and education at Health City go handinhandand Springfield Land Corporations commitment toeducation is one of the cornerstones of our philosophy.Education City, a joint venture between Springfield LandCorporation and Mirvac, is a unique campus that bringstogether education, training and learning providers in onelocation and is already home to providers such as theUniversity of Southern Queensland USQ, Bremer TAFE,and St Peters Lutheran College. Stage one of Education City was opened in March 2006and included the first stage of the University of SouthernQueensland USQ incorporating a sixstorey building and350seat auditorium a multieducation provider anacademic and vocational training building a childcarefacility and childcare training centre retail outlets and astudent accommodation village. Once complete, Education City, currently housing over2000 students, will be home to more than 10,000, inaddition to the 8000 school students already in the area.This encapsulates our approach it is not just aboutproviding health and education facilities but more aboutproviding an integrated lifestyle offering where Springfieldresidents can walk to work or university, and benefit fromchildcare and healthcare only a stones throw away. In the past a wellplanned development was underpinnedby its infrastructure of roads, sewerage and stormwater, allof which remains fundamental today. Springfield LandCorporation has anticipated the future growth of the cityand planned for much of the infrastructure, including ahighway with links to the major centres of South EastQueensland, and a future rail link. Greater Springfield has been the enabling catalyst for theWestern Corridor as evidenced by the State Governmentscommitment to invest in the Centenary Highway. The future living environment in Greater Springfield is avital part of the planning and development process. Onethird of Greater Springfield will always remain green spacewith over 855 hectares of preserved open space includinghike and bike trails around lakes and waterways which willmeander through subtropical parks and gardens. Driven journeyWhen we first saw the opportunity to create GreaterSpringfield some thought it was bizarre, even mad, but thejourney has been driven by the desire to do the right thing.We are creating a community that is self reliant, fullyintegrated and serviced as well as socially, economicallyand environmentally sustainable. When we first began this journey 16 years ago it wasnot even legally possible to build such a city and we hadto fight for legislation to allow plans to be implemented.We wanted to go further and do better than previousplanned communities. We wanted to combine the needsfor every aspect of living within the one master plannedenvelope work, education, entertainment, lifestyle,productivity, leisure and health. Although Greater Springfield is still a city in the making,it already stands as an unusual example of a masterplanned community and takes the concept of good urbanplanning far into the future. There is now no question thatwe need to create communities that are environmentally,socially and economically sustainable. In order to do thiswe have to employ all the fundamentals of good planningand ensure that the delivery makes it happen. Centrally located within one of the major growthcorridors of South East Queensland, this is a city that hassustainability, liveability, connectivity, walkability andaccessibility at its core. We are developing a city which isbringing together the very best in business, technology,education, retail, social facilities and lifestyle  this will bea smart city. We believe it sets a benchmark not only forAustralia but for the rest of the world. Dr Maha Sinnathamby is the Chairman ofSpringfield Land Corporation which is creatingGreater Springfield.

All levels of government, businessand communities will have to learn to live with the newdynamics of sustainable competition. Some commentators see costs and a challenge otherssuch as Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor ofCalifornia, see opportunities and have described oursituation as the third great environmental revolution.Dealing with climate change, reducing our carbonfootprint and learning to live with less intense energy formsthan oil will demand that we change how we live, thenature of business, the shape of cities and the nature ofagricultural production systems.North Queensland has focused on the potential of thenew dynamics of regional sustainable competition. Acollaborative partnership of councils, business andcommunity has formed a sustainable farming and soilcarbon sequestration industry cluster. The partnership, facilitated by Townsville Council,recognised that we are undergoing an historical shift incompetition from land, labour and capital to ideas,innovation, resource efficiency and entrepreneurship.Regions will compete on the knowledge intensity of theirproducts and services and on the basis of a low carbonfootprint. This cluster recognised the potential to build a nationallysignificant new knowledge industry based on carbontrading that provides a more financially viable basis forsustainable farming. The Australian Government hascommitted to a radical decarbonisation of 60 by 2050. Ross Garnaut recently released his second report for thegovernment on the introduction of an emissions tradingscheme by 2010. His report says the scheme should allowfor few exemptions and hence the need for all sectors tobuy carbon offsets to meet reduction targets. Carbon trading globally is growing at 20 p.a. andwas estimated at 63 billion for 2007 The Australian April19, 2008. When global emissions trading is introduced,it will be a trillion dollar global industry.The proposed new emissions trading scheme will have adramatic effect both on business, communities andcouncils. Councils will be faced with the challenge ofemissions reduction in their waste dumps, vehicle fleet,power usage and road and construction costs.The NQ regions economy is dependent on energyintensive mining, minerals processing, manufacturing andagricultural production. The introduction of a compulsorynational emissions trading scheme will have significantcosts  costs of carbon credits will have to be met eitherinternally or imported from global markets. Townsville Council is working closely with local industry to boost the regions economy by generating and trading carboncredits. The councils Manager Economic Development, Andrew McEwen, writes that such trading could generatemillions of dollars for local farmers and is being closely watched by other councils interested in replicating the model.We hope that you have enjoyed reading the EconomicDevelopment Journal.

North Queensland has the potential to act as a hubfor carbon trading for northern Australia. Carbon TownsvilleThe sustainable farming and soil carbon sequestrationcluster has worked with Townsville Carbon Exchange PtyLtd to develop Carbon Townsville. Carbon Townsville willbe governed by a community board and will act for thebenefit of the community. Townsville Carbon Exchange Pty Ltd is the operationalvehicle which performs the carbon trading function andmonitors progress of carbon activities. Carbon Townsvillewill promote carbon trading generally. A serviceagreement will provide a payment per tonne of carbontraded into a community benefit fund. These monies will be available to promote sustainablecommunities, sustainable farming and fund research toreduce North Queenslands carbon footprint. TheTownsville Carbon Exchange Pty Ltd will manage theprovision of services along the carbon value chain,including marketing and writing of contracts, soil carbontesting, carbon credit aggregation and sale and will beresponsible for ensuring that an independent accreditedauditor evaluates the value chain.Aggregation and sale of carbon creditsTownsville Carbon Exchange will provide wholesalecarbon credits to the Australian National ClimateExchange or a national ETS, which will be registered onthe National Environment Register. It will facilitate thedevelopment of a carbon trading knowledge networkcluster. A range of abatement methodologies are planned. Theseinclude Soil carbon sequestration Energy efficiency Renewable energy Biofuels and Demand Side Management DSM.Carbon credits can be established through emissionsreduction or abatement where an organisation orindividual changes or replaces a process or activity inorder to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases from itsbusiness as usual operations. Carbon Townsville will place initial emphasis ontransforming the regional agricultural economy throughinnovation via soil carbon sequestration technologies. The value chain validation processThe Garnaut report has identified the potential for carbonsoil sequestration, using biological farming methods, as 39Volume 2 Number 3one of the potential sources of significant carbon credits.The rules of the Kyoto Agreement provide for soilsequestration of carbon along with trees and resourceefficiency and renewable energies.The Kyoto rules require the following be met Prima facie scientific case that what is being purportedto occur is scientifically based That there is a verification process that measuresindependently the level of carbon content in the soilbefore and after the period That there is an independent accredited Kyoto auditorthat validates the authenticity of the value chain and That credits are aggregated and validated and acceptedfor trading.The Townsville Trading Exchange and the working groupfor Carbon Townsville have met with representatives of theAustralian Stock Exchange, EPA NSW and Zero Waste asindependent agents for the Australian Government. Thevarious meetings in February 2008 developed aframework for accreditation for carbon trading that is likelyto become the basis for forming an Australian standard. The Townsville Trading Exchange has the basis for aprima facie scientific case for soil sequestration that hasbeen presented to international conferences. There is anindependently validated method for remote sensing forcarbon credits with onground sample testing inaccordance with ISO9000. A quality assurance manual has been prepared formanaging the value chain process. Contracts are currently being prepared for farmers andother interested parties. The Townsville Trading ExchangePty Ltd is committed to commence wholesale trading inAugust 2008. There is significant interest from councils,NGOs, schools, indigenous communities, corporatebusinesses, farmers and graziers.Soil carbon sequestration processSoil carbon sequestration involves the use of biologicalagents being sprayed in a controlled manner on land. Thebiological agents extract carbon, nitrogen, phosphorusand water from the air and sequester it in the soil. Initially,a base line for the level of carbon on the land is establishedusing aerial spectroscopy and onground validation usingNATA certified laboratories. The contract with the landowner requires that a suitablebiological agent is sprayed three times over a twoyearperiod. Half the estimated carbon that can be sequestered iscommodified through the exchange. The Carbon Townsvillecertificates are registered on a national scheme for sale. Once the credits have been sold the landowner receives10 of the sale price, the carbon trading exchange 10for its services and 80 is held in Trust. At the end of thetwoyear period contract, the level of carbon is remeasuredand independently validated. If the estimated carbon credits are met, the landownerreceives the 80 of funds held in Trust. If the land has sequestered more than the estimatedamount, the full additional amount of carbon credits canimmediately be sold. The amount of carbon sequesteredvaries with the original quality of the land organic carboncontent. The lower the quality of soil, the higher will be thepotential for sequestration of carbon. Returns of 55 tonnesof carbon per hectare per annum have been achieved ona number of test farms and parkland sites over the past fiveyears. Significantly higher returns have been achieved ondegraded lands. The soil carbon sequestration process will plateau andreach a natural absorption limit. Farms using the VRM Ptybioagents have recorded rises for over five years. Thereturn on 1000 hectares at a price of 20 traded and 10wholesale would be in the order of 2.2 million over fouryears. The cost will vary with location because of differences inprice for the provision of the biological agents, sprayingregimes and the cost of aerial and ground carbonassessment. Urban costs for landowners are estimated at400 per hectare over four years. The net return to the landowner would conservatively be1.5m over four years. Indicative figures for Townsville andother councils, indigenous communities and farmerssuggests substantial multimillion dollar revenue streamsover a fouryear period. Carbon trading and regional economic developmentNetwork cluster analysis suggests there would be up to 32different business types that would make up the businessecosystem to support carbon trading and sustainablefarming. Given rapidly escalating fertiliser costs and thesavings made from bioagents, it is realistic to assume thata target of 1 million hectares horticultural and grazing isachievable within three to five years. The initial registration of interest from landholderssuggests the 2008 target of 100,000 hectares will beexceeded and that the 2009 onward targets are realistic.The injection of 1 billion into the rural and regionaleconomy will revitalise small towns and regional centresand contribute to the overall health of the NorthQueensland economy. The carbon trading cluster has the potential to add 5 to10 to the gross regional product GRP over five to 10years. This would provide an additional 1000 million in 40Volume 2 Number 3income to the region and up to 4000 jobs over five to 10years.Building sustainable agricultural systemsTransitioning to sustainable agricultural systems that canensure and secure affordable food has to address thechallenges of energy, ecological costs and reducing thecarbon footprint of agriculture. More resilient and sustainable methods need to beintroduced into agricultural and land management systemsthat can Reduce nutrient runoff into aquatic systems and naturalecosystems Reduce the impact on the Great Barrier Reef Provide for savings in terms of overall use of oil andfertilisers Reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the carbonfootprint Reverse decline in productivity for factor input offertilisers and Provide more affordable and secure highnutrient foods.The experience in North Queensland over five years ofusing biological systems for farming have shown significantgains against each of the criteria to measure landmanagement. The biological methods are reducing by 3040 the useof chemical fertilisers and reducing the runoff by thebiological process that holds the nutrients in the soil. Thenutrient runoff is reducing the nutrient load on theecosystems and the Barrier Reef. While more work is required, it is arguable thebiological methods that stabilise carbon cycle, nitrogenand reduce fertiliser use are significantly reducing theecologicalcarbon footprint. The research to date alsoindicates the biological agents are also sequestering waterfrom the air into the soil. This has significant potential for farming using lessground water. This has major implications for areas ofAustralia under water stress or with limited water security.ConclusionWe are on the cusp of a new environmental revolution thatis redefining competition and will reshape the nature ofbusiness and communities. The new emissions tradingschemes and carbon trading will bring both costs andbenefits. Townsville Carbon Exchange is a unique carbonexchange model in that it will work with local industry todevelop carbon abatement capacity. The sustainablefarming and carbon trading cluster will add significantly tothe resilience and adaptation capability of NorthQueensland. As the Mayor of Townsville, Cr Les Tyrell, said, thecarbon trading cluster will add significantly to the NorthQueensland economy, but most importantly contribute to arenaissance in rural economies through supporting moresustainable farming.Andrew McEwen is a Member of CarbonTownsville and Cofounder of the Centre forExcellence in Tropical Design, Sustainability Innovation.

Runningalongside these trends are new economic generators ofwealth, for example, healthy communities in which highlyskilled employees can live and work. These drivers mean thatbusinesses in the 21st century must adopt strategic planningmodels and operational methods that create value andmarkets now without compromising the future. This articleexplores the development some of the key components ofsustainable business development models and strategies.  Sustainability, Sustainable Developmentand Sustainable Business Development The principles of sustainability are increasingly seen as akey solution to emerging problems associated with climatechange, energy crisis, wealth inequities and sustainablelabour standards. Sustainable Development is based on theidea that business activities should be carried out at ratesthat are equal to or less than the earths natural capital orcapacity to support them, for example, by naturalenvironmental mitigation.Businesses will play a major role in driving sustainabilityas changing consumer preferences throw up newopportunities. Business can achieve this by creating valuein the present that does not compromise the ability to createfuture value. Sustainable Business Development aims toachieve sustainable business outcomes that balance theperformance objectives of the present with needs andexpectations of the future.Sustainable Business Development models seek toreconcile the key drivers of business such as profit,competitiveness, market share, and organisation capabilitywith the sustainability concepts of environment, economicgrowth, community cohesion and development andgovernment policy and leadership. Sustainable Business Development is a sub set ofsustainable development. Key sustainable businessdevelopment concepts include Adopting sustainability principles to a commercialcontext Creating value in a sustainable way Aligning business capabilities with external drivers of theeconomy, social and environmental forces and the valuesof the market, stakeholders and technology   Adopting strategies that manage the transformation ofthe business to produce future value and  Transforming and reinvigorating the company.Pathway to SustainableBusiness DevelopmentThe principles and approach of sustainable businessdevelopment have evolved in a series of generational stepssince the 1970s as shown in Table 1. Following initialminimal responses to environmental regulation in the 1980s,the approach by business has evolved to include systematicmanagement of environmental impacts and productstewardship in response to increasing community andcustomer concerns. In the 21st century, an increasing numberof leading businesses now focus on creating business valuethrough the sustainable business development approach.This involves identifying business value opportunities withinthe market, economy, environment and social context andintegrating them into systematic thinking for the present andfuture. Companies use such tools as balanced score card tocreate balanced solutions for all stakeholders. Sustainablebusiness development creates sustainable competitiveadvantage by reducing impacts, costs, increasing benefits,improved marketing position and improved reputation. TheThere are good reasons for taking Sustainable Business Development SBD seriously, as Ian Williamson outlines inthis analysis. 42Volume 2 Number 3approach is no longer confined to theenvironmental engineering department, but isrelevant to the entire organisation and its staff, forexample, designers, research and development,marketing, supply chain, lawyers andaccountants. Sustainability ReportingThe importance of sustainability as a guidingbusiness principle is reflected in the uptake offormal sustainability assessment and reportingby large companies in Australia and overseas.The assessment tools, measures and reportingframework is provided by the Global ReportingInitiative GRI 2002 Sustainability ReportingGuidelines. A recent survey of top ASX andunlisted companies, The state of Sustainability Reporting inAustralia 2005 conducted by the Centre for AustralianEthical Research CAER and KPMG found 24 of the entire 486 companies covered by the surveyare producing a sustainability report  The types of reports produced changed substantiallysince last year. Sustainability reports now dominate thefield of reporting increasing from 26 to 37 andcorporate social responsibility reports also showed aconsiderable increase from 9 to 18 and  The majority of the reports produced were standalone,as opposed to annual report or website sections.The report found that the reports are used tocommunicate information on environmental and other nonfinancial performance social and economic to theirstakeholders. The report foundIt is recognised as an important mechanism forimproving corporate sustainability performance. This isbased on generating business value through measurementand management of environmental risks and opportunities,and reporting this information in a fashion that responds tothe growing expectations of customers, business partners,investors and the wider community. Although corporatereporting is a relatively new approach to informingstakeholders about environmental performance, its uptakehas been strong and is increasing steadily  The State ofSustainability Reporting in Australia 2005.Linking Sustainability concepts toSustainable Business DevelopmentThe key principles of Sustainable Development andequivalent Sustainable Business Development concepts areshown in Table 2. The major SBD principles include theconcepts include Enterprise thinking Extending involvement ofbusiness to social and natural world  Value network Effectiveness creation and use ofnetworks with and external to the business Value creation Overarching goal of the business tocreate value over time and place  Innovativeness Ideal solutions eliminate waste andincrease value creation for all stakeholders. Developing Sustainable BusinessDevelopment StrategiesThe development of sustainable business strategies requiresthe achievement of short and longterm plans by thesystematic development of business, product andtechnological development programs.The key stages of the strategic process are shown inTable 3. Critical elements to the success of developing newsustainable business development strategies and programsinclude A sound understanding of the business environment andissues affecting its markets, customers, stakeholders andthe community 1  A understanding the importance of sustainable businessdevelopment processes as critical to ensuring the futurecreation of business value 2 The use of SBD to guide objectives, strategies andevaluation criteria 3  Sound policies to select and implement SBD programs 3 The use of clear change management processes tointroduce and integrate new programs across theorganisation 4 The use of Life Cycle Thinking to improve all aspects of theuse and impact of resources, technologies and products 4. Managing ChangeEffective management systems are required to managechanges to the new and existing programs inorganisations. Two approaches to the strategicmanagement of new strategies include the use oftransitional bottom up environmental managementsystems and transitional top down change processes.Timeline Generation Methods Drivers2000s 3Sustainable BusinessDevelopmentExceed expectations1990s 2 Pollution reductionProduct stewardship Exceed expectations1980s 1Regulation complianceEnvironmental ProtectionLaws  meet standards1970sMarket driven  minimum costSell productsTable 1 Pathway to Sustainable Business Development 43Volume 2 Number 3Table 2 The key principles of Sustainable Development and equivalent Sustainable Business Development conceptsSustainable DevelopmentPrinciplesSustainable BusinessConcepts ExplanationRight to coexist Enterprise thinking Extending thinking beyond the business entity Life Cycle Thinking LCT thinking Balanced scorecard.

One approach may be to usea combination of short term transformational wins andlong term transitional programs to put the enterprise on asustainable footing.Value Creation in Sustainable BusinessDevelopmentThe key goal of sustainable business development is thecontinued drive to create value for the enterprise. Thecreation of value is the major criteria for formulatingstrategies and program. Value creation derives fromincreasing the wealth of shareholders and meeting theneeds of customers and shareholders. In the newsustainability paradigm, this includes stakeholders with aninterest in creating wealth today without compromising theability of the company to create future wealth or diminishingthe future environmental, social and social capacity.From this perspective, sustainable solutions have thepotential to create more value than other alternatives byproviding business stability, resource certainty, capabilitydevelopment and performance interest. This means thatsolutions should aim to maximise value for all and wherepossible not trade off benefits of one stakeholder over another.The guiding criteria for creating sustainable value includevalue creation, insightfulness, equity, effectiveness and stability.Economic value can be measured by comparing benefitsto cost of a program, where Benefits equal direct and indirect tangible and intangiblebenefits, effects and knowledge including social andenvironmental impacts Costs equal to the sum of the direct and indirectinvestment, defects and burdens.The calculation of the value enables business tomake decisions based on the opportunity cost ofone venture compared to another. Sustainable Business Development strategiesinclude short term measures to create stability andsuccess, for example, promoting green products.Midterm strategies may seek to analyse andposition the business for change, for example,market positioning and assessment. A core thirdstrategy is to lead and instill new long termsustainable processes and direction, for example,by developing new cultures, product innovationsand building new value networks.
