S. Iyengar(Florida International University) Improving Disaster Management and Recovery techniques is one of national priorities given the huge toll caused by man-made and nature calamities. Data-driven disaster management aims at applying advanced data collection and analysis technologies to achieve more effective and responsive disaster management, and has undergone considerable progress in the last decade. However, to the best of our knowledge, currently there is no work that both summarizes recent progress and suggests future research directions for this emerging research area. To remedy this situation, we provide a systematic treatment of the recent developments in data-driven disaster management. Specifically, we first present a general overview on the requirements and system architectures of disaster management systems, and then summarize state of the art data-driven techniques that have been applied on improving situation awareness as well as in addressing users information needs in disaster management. We also discuss and categorize general data mining and machine learning techniques in disaster management, and finally recommend several research directions for further investigations. Hashing Techniques: A Survey and Taxonomy Dr. Lianhua Chi(IBM Research Australia); Prof. Xingquan Zhu With the rapid development of information storage and networking technologies, quintillion bytes of data are generated every day from social networks, business transactions, sensors, and many other domains. The increasing data volumes impose significant challenges to traditional data analysis tools in storing, processing, and analysing these extremely large-scale data. For decades, hashing is one of the most effective tools commonly used to compress data for fast access and analysis. Hashing techniques have also evolved from simple randomization approaches to advanced adaptive methods considering locality, structure, or label information of the data for effective hashing. This survey reviews and categorizes existing hashing techniques as a taxonomy, in order to provide a comprehensive view of mainstream hashing techniques for different types of data and domain applications. The taxonomy also studies uniqueness of each method and therefore can serve as technique references in understanding the niche of different hashing mechanisms for future development. Simulation and Experimentation Platforms for Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks: Advancements and Challenges Hanjiang Luo (Zibo Vocational Institute, Shenzhen University); Kaishun Wu (Shenzhen University); Rukhsana Ruby (Shenzhen University); Feng Hong (Ocean University of China); Zhongwen Guo (Ocean University of China); Lionel M. Ni (University of Macau) Ocean and water basically cover the major parts of our planet earth. In order to obtain the best utilization of the underlying resources on these parts of earth, people have made some research advancement. Specically, the research on underwater wireless acoustic sensor networks (UWA-SNs) has made a great progress. However, wide deployment of UWA-SNs is far from the reality due to several reasons. One important reason is that offshore deployment and eld-level experiments of ocean-centric applications are both expensive and labor-intensive. Other alternatives to attain this objective are to conduct simulation or experimentation which can reduce cost, and accelerate the research activities and their outcomes. However, designing efcient and reliable simulation and experimentation platforms are proved to be more challenging beyond the expectation. In this paper, we explore the main techniques (and their pros and cons) and components to develop simulation and experimentation platforms, and provide a comprehensive survey report in this area. We classify simulation and experimentation platforms based on some typical criteria, and then provide useful guidelines for researchers on choosing suitable platforms in accordance with their requirements. Finally, we address some open and un-resolved issues in this context, and provide some suggestions on future research. Smart Computing and Sensing Technologies for Animal Welfare: A Systematic Review Prof. Admela Jukan(Technische Universitat Carolo Wilhelmina zu Braunschweig); Dr. Xavier Masip-Bruin ; Dr. Nina Amla(National Science Foundation) Animals play a profoundly important and intricate role in our lives today. Dogs have been human companions for thousands of years, but they now work to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and rescue situations. Farm animals are a critical part of sustainable agriculture today, and there is increasing consumer interest in humanely raised livestock, and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint. Wild animals are threatened with extinction by human induced factors, and shrinking and compromised habitat. This review sets the goal to systematically survey the existing literature in smart computing and sensing technologies for domestic, farm and wild animal welfare. We use the notion of \emph{animal welfare} in broad terms, to review the technologies for assessing whether animals are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and also positively stimulated in their environment. Also the notion of \emph{smart computing and sensing} is used in broad terms, to refer to computing and sensing systems that are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of remote data collection, processing, exchange and analysis. The findings of this review are expected to motivate future research in computer science and engineering, as well as contribute to data, information and communication management for animal welfare. Systematic Review of Software Behavioral Model Consistency Checking Mrs. Faiz Ul Muram(University of Vienna); Dr. Huy Tran(University of Vienna); Prof. Uwe Zdun(University of Vienna) In software development, models are often used to represent multiple views of the same system. Such models need to be properly related to each other in order to provide a consistent description of the developed system. Models may contain contradictory system specifications, for instance, when they evolve independently. Therefore, it is very crucial to ensure that models conform to each other. In this context, we focus on consistency checking of behavior models. Several techniques and approaches have been proposed in the existing literature to support behavioral model consistency checking. This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that was carried out to obtain an overview of the various consistency concepts, problems, and solutions proposed regarding behavior models. In our study, the identification and selection of the primary studies was based on a well-planned search strategy. The search process identified a total of 1770 primary studies, out of which 96 have been thoroughly analyzed according to our predefined SLR protocol. The SLR aims to highlight the state-of-the-art of software behavior model consistency checking and identify potential gaps for future research. Evaluation of Knowledge Gaps for Mathematical Applications in Thermographic Image Processing Technique Mr. sayantan nath(Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad) This document deals with literature reviews on fire prevention method especially in mining industries by thermal image processing techniques. The fire protection system is crucial because of the total loss of human lives due to coal fire and fatal explosions in coalmines across the world in last few decades are huge. In this regards, the fire break out always take the first and foremost place in safety perspective with increasing demand for energy, coal supply and obviously in coal mining will continue to grow upto 2050. To detect the uncertain fire break out condition, thermal imaging technique has been considered most significant among several early warning methods to recognize spontaneous combustion of coal pile, e.g., temperature recordings by sensors, compaction testing of ore seam, gas tests, etc. The evolution of thermographic imaging technique assisted with numerous applications of mathematical models would be discussed in the light of safety dimension in mining industry in this manuscript elaborately. The missing links or unattended areas of mathematics in application of thermal image processing in mining especially in coal industry would be evolved as the gap in knowledge suggested in the conclusion of this article A Survey on Data Flow Testing Mr. Ting Su(Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing); Mr. Ke Wu(Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing); Dr. Weikai Miao(Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing); Prof. Geguan Pu(Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing); Prof. Jifeng He(Shanghai Key Laboratory of Trustworthy Computing); Prof. Yuting Chen(Shanghai Jiaotong University); Dr. Zhendong Su(University of California, Davis) Data flow testing (DFT) is a family of testing strategies designed to verify correct interactions between each program variables definition and its uses. Such a test objective of interest is referred to as a def-use pair. The goal of DFT is to exercise every pair w.r.t. different testing criteria (i.e., data flow coverage criteria). Herman introduced the concept of DFT in 1976. Since then, various data flow-based coverage criteria have been proposed. A number of studies have also been conducted, both theoretically and empirically, to analyze DFTs complexity and effectiveness. The effectiveness of DFT in fault detection has stimulated various approaches to pursue efficient and automated data flow testing. This survey presents a detailed overview of data flow testing, including challenges and approaches in enforcing and automating it: (1) It classifies and discusses techniques for test data generation, such as random testing, collateral coverage-based testing, search-based testing, symbolic execution-based testing and model checking-based testing; (2) it discusses techniques for tracking data flow coverage; (3) it summarizes recent advances and discusses future research directions toward more practical data flow testing; and (4) it presents several DFT applications, including software fault localization, web security testing, and specification consistency checking. Changes as First Class Citizens: A Research Perspective on Modern Software Tooling Quinten David Soetens (University of Antwerp); Romain Robbes (University of Chile); Serge Demeyer (University of Antwerp) Software must evolve to keep up with an ever-changing context, the real world. We discuss an emergent trend in software evolution research revolving around the central notion that drives evolution: Change. By reifying change, and by modelling it as a first-class entity, researchers can now analyse the complex phe- nomenon known as software evolution with an unprecedented degree of accuracy. We present a Systematic Mapping Study of 86 papers to give an overview on the state of the art in this area of research and present a roadmap with open issues and future directions. Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Team Sports Joachim Gudmundsson (University of Sydney); Michael Horton (University of Sydney) Team-based invasion sports such as football, basketball and hockey are similar in the sense that the players are able to move freely around the playing area; and that player and team performance cannot be fully analysed without considering the movements and interactions of all players as a group. State of the art object tracking systems now produce spatio-temporal traces of player trajectories with high definition and high frequency, and this, in turn, has facilitated a variety of research efforts, across many disciplines, to extract insight from the trajectories. We survey recent research efforts that use spatio-temporal data from team sports as input, and involve non-trivial computation. This article categorises the research efforts in a coherent framework and identifies a number of open research questions. Imitation Learning: A Survey of Learning Methods Ahmed Hussein (Robert Gordon University); Mohamed Medhat Gaber (Birmingham City University); Eyad Elyan (Robert Gordon University); Chrisina Jayne (Robert Gordon University) Imitation learning techniques aim to model human behavior in a given task. An agent is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years, however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this paper, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications and highlight current and future research directions. Deep Learning Advances in Computer Vision with 3D Data: A Survey Anastasia Ioannidou (ITI, CERTH); Elisavet Chatzilari (ITI, CERTH); Spiros Nikolopoulos (ITI, CERTH); Ioannis Kompatsiaris (ITI, CERTH) Deep learning has recently gained popularity achieving state-of-the-art performance in tasks involving text, sound or image processing. Due to its outstanding performance, there have been efforts to apply it in more challenging scenarios, e.g. 3D data processing. This article surveys methods applying deep learning on 3D data and provides a classification based on how they exploit them. From the results of the examined works, we conclude that systems employing 2D views of 3D data typically surpass voxel-based (3D) deep models which however can perform better with more layers and severe data augmentation. Therefore, larger-scale datasets and increased resolutions are required. CASE Tool Support for Variability Management in Software Product Lines Dr. Rabih Bashroush(University of East London); Mr. Muhammad Garba(University of East London); Dr. Rick Rabiser(Johannes Kepler University); Dr. Iris Groher(Johannes Kepler University); Dr. Goetz Botterweck(University of Limerick) Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of todays software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 30 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies. A Taxonomy and Survey of Cloud Resource Orchestration Techniques Denis Weerasiri (University of New South Wales); Moshe Chai Barukh (University of New South Wales); Boualem Benatallah (University of New South Wales); Quan Z. Sheng (Macquarie University); Rajiv Ranjan (University of Newcastle) Cloud services and applications prove indispensable amidst todays modern utility-based computing. The cloud has displayed disruptive and growing impact on everyday computing tasks. However, facilitating the orchestration of cloud resources in order to build such cloud services and applications is yet to unleash its entire magnitude of power. Accordingly, it is paramount to devise a unified and comprehensive analysis framework in order to accelerate fundamental understanding of cloud resource orchestration in terms of concepts, paradigms, languages, models and tools. This framework is essential to empower effective research, comprehension, comparison and selection of cloud resource orchestration models, languages, platforms and tools. This article provides such a comprehensive framework whilst analyzing the relevant state-of-the-art in cloud resource orchestration from a novel and holistic viewpoint. A Survey on Financial Applications of Metaheuristics Amparo Soler-Dominguez (Universitat Jaume I); Angel A. Juan (Open University of Catalonia); Renatas Kizys (University of Portsmouth) Modern heuristics or metaheuristics are optimization algorithms that have been increasingly used during the last decades to support complex decision making in a number of fields, such as logistics and transportation, telecommunication networks, bioinformatics, finance, etc. The continuous increase in computing power, together with advancements in metaheuristics frameworks and parallelization strategies, are empowering these types of algorithms as one of the best alternatives to solve rich and real-life combinatorial optimization problems that arise in a number of financial and banking activities. This paper reviews some of the works related to the use of metaheuristics in solving both classical and emergent problems in the finance arena. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes rich portfolio optimization, index tracking, enhanced indexation, credit risk, stock investments, financial project scheduling, option pricing, feature selection, bankruptcy and financial distress prediction, and credit risk assessment. The paper also discusses some open opportunities for researchers in the field, and forecast the evolution of metaheuristics to include real-life uncertainty conditions into the optimization problems being considered. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN): A survey on reliability, fault tolerance, and technologies coexistence Dr. Ahmed Al-Dubai (Edinburgh Napier University School of Computing); Miss Marwa Salayma(Edinburgh Napier University); Dr. Imed Romdhani(Edinburgh Napier University); Dr. Youssef Nasser(American University of Beirut) Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has been a key element in e-health to monitor bodies. This technology enables new applications under the umbrella of different domains, including the medical field, the entertainment and ambient intelligence areas. This survey paper places substantial emphasis on the concept and key features of the WBAN technology. First, the WBAN concept is introduced and a review of key applications facilitated by this networking technology is provided. The study then explores a wide variety of communication standards and methods deployed in this technology. Due to the sensitivity and criticality of the data carried and handled by WBAN, fault tolerance is a critical issue and widely discussed in this paper. Hence, this survey investigates thoroughly the reliability and fault tolerance paradigms suggested for WBANs. Open research and challenging issues pertaining to fault tolerance, coexistence and interference management and power consumption are also discussed along with some suggested trends in these aspects.
