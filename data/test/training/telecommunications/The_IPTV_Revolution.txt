June 23, 2006 The IPTV Revolution New Opportunities, New Challenges for Satellite Communications Systems www.globecommsystems.com A little bit of satellite goes a long way The IPTV Revolution Page 2    www.globecommsystems.com  Introduction  Advances in technology, improvements in communications infrastructure, and growing user demand are driving toward the creation of a single, common digital medium.  It will be a unified global platform capable of enabling transmission of digital information in virtually any form across broadband networks. We call it digital convergence.  While the term has been used and perhaps misused for years, it is clearly the right term for the revolutionary paradigm shift that is taking place in the telecommunications world today. 1  With the advent of Internet protocol television IPTV, the vision of a universal communications platform is quickly becoming a reality. The convergence of IPbased content delivery networks with traditional voice and data communications is creating exciting new services in multiple markets .  In the coming years, consumers will enjoy access to customized content, rich applications, and personalized interactive entertainment in homes, automobiles and handheld devices, all enabled by IPbased communication networks.  IPTV Defined  Internet Protocol Television IPTV is the television element of a multimedia offering, which may also include Internet, telephony, gaming, cellular, mobile, andor home networking services. In the context of this paper, IPTV is not streaming television broadcast over the Internet, but is a part of an overall managed service provided to a subscriber base through a closed network.   More than likely, that network is an existing telephone companys broadband network, developed for voice and data communication, and rapidly transitioning into a digitally convergent multimedia network utilizing IPTV to deliver television content. Necessitated by the fear that cable operators will and are addressing their residential voice markets, carrier operators are embracing IPTV as a weapon to not only counter the cable attack, but to capture new revenue from a market that they are not presently serving.  The major advantage of IPTV is its ability to provide a much richer television experience to the viewing audience through its addressability and interactive functionality. In todays fast paced world, the subscriber wants to watch what they want, when they want, and where they want. Instead of paying for channels that are rarely viewed, because of its addressability, IPTV allows the service provider to deliver to the subscriber only those channels that he or she wants to see. Programming is available to anyone who wants to see it and a la cart pricing will become the norm.2   The most unique and compelling feature of IPTV is the promise of its interactive functionality. Unlike most legacy cable television architectures, IPTV service necessitates twoway communications between the subscriber and the service provider. For IPTV, that communications medium is Internet protocol The IPTV Revolution Page 3    www.globecommsystems.com  over the service providers broadband network.  Twoway communication gives the subscriber access to customized television content as well as networked gaming, video conferencing, home networking, catalogue shopping, videoondemand, informationondemand, interactive education and much more. In turn, the service provider has the ability to provide targeted advertising, focused programming, and other value added features that will add to their revenue stream.  Todays incumbent telephone companies are at a disadvantage when compared to multiple service operators MSOs who can deliver tripleplay service Voice, Internet and Television. As such, they are in a race to achieve videoservice parity with cable operators and are looking at IPTV as means to compete and leapfrog the offerings of the competition.    The Cost of Content Aggregation   While a cable network transmits all channels to each user, the IPTV network transmits only the channels the viewer is actually watching.  That means an IPTV network can offer an effectively unlimited number of channels. The number of channels that can be offered on a cable network, however,  is limited by the 850 MHz spectrum allotted on its hybrid fiber coax plant.  In order to provide unlimited channels, hundreds of video program channels must be aggregated and made available for distribution to the subscriber.  This lends itself well to pointtomultipoint distribution over satellite. That is, a central content receive site or IPTV Super Headend will aggregate content from satellite downlinks and then distribute that content to local access points or regional headends over IP all the way to the subscriber.   Building an IPTV Super Headend can impose a high capital expenditure burden since multiple antennas are required to receive existing video content from multiple satellites across the satellite arc and each video stream must be transmitted in its own selfcontained single program transport stream SPTS as opposed to a multi program transport stream MPTS. Each channel must be received, decoded, deencrypted, and then encoded, encrypted and IPencapsulated for distribution to the regional sites. With hundreds of channels and redundancy, the cost for a large IPTV Super Headend can exceed 20 million dollars. Even more difficult for the uninitiated service provider is the acquisition of content where each individual channel of video content must be negotiated with the individual content owners. This can be long and burdensome process with both legal and financial considerations.   As a solution to the issues described above, companies including SES Americom with its IP PRIME service and Intelsat with its Ampiage service are building IPTV Super Headends and offering prepackaged, bundled, programming to the telephone companies.3  This alleviates the significant initial capital burden on the service provider and allows them to focus on their access The IPTV Revolution Page 4    www.globecommsystems.com  network and new product offerings. Prior to these new offerings, some of the smaller telephone companies have developed shared super headends andor built their own smaller capacity headends.  Inside the IPTV Super Headend  At the IPTV Super Headend, the Satellite Program Acquisition System receives video content from geosynchronous satellites in the local orbital arc for turnaround retransmission. Because the content is coming from diverse providers, the received video formats and standards may be different.  Some of the programs will be analog and some will be digital. They may or may not be encrypted. Some analog signals will use the NTSC video format and some may be PAL or SECAM. For digital transmission, there may be programs that are in the clear and others that are encrypted. In the U.S., depending on the encoding, the encryption may be Videocipher Motorola, PowerVu ScientificAtlanta, andor DVB Tandberg, Scopus and others.  Until the individual channel acquisition rights have been negotiated, there is no way of knowing the exact receive channel composition.  The initial approach is to provide a flexible design for the Super Headend that can accommodate multiple formats and make provision for standard converters and video processing equipment for some of the channels.  The Super Headend antenna diameter and type is provided in accordance with the expected EIRP of the carriers to be accessed and broadcast quality signaltonoise reception of the carriers. Low Noise Block LNB converters with Lband outputs are typically used allowing reception of the entire satellite band. If the distance between the antenna and receivers is greater than 100 meters, then usage of LBand fiber optic transmission of these widebandreceived carriers for distribution within the facility is recommended.   The sizes and type of satellite receiveonly antennas is determined by the proposed channel lineup.  If the majority of the channels can be accessed via satellite transponders located within a 70 viewing arc from the Super Headend location, then a multibeam receiveonly antenna system may be a good.   For its IP PRIME service, SES Americom utilizes a 7meter Simulsat multibeam antenna. The Simulsat antenna is parabolic in one plane and spherical in the other. At its maximum capacity, this unique design allows the Simulsat to perform like nearly threedozen parabolic earth station antennas. The Simulsat antenna is 2 FCC compliant and can capture satellite signals from up to 35 satellites within a 70 arc view. SES Americom has a 4.5meter full motion antenna in reserve as a backup in case of a failure of a feed or low noise block converter LNB.  Signals from the low noise block converters LNBs are routed to LBand patch panels located in an environmentally controlled equipment cabinet mounted on the antenna pad. The IPTV Revolution Page 5    www.globecommsystems.com   The equipment cabinet houses the subsystems required to support the antennalocated equipment, which includes patch panels, fiber optic transmitters and test facilities. This equipment cabinet can be mounted on the Simulsat antenna foundation or on a small foundation in close proximity to the antenna system.  Once terminated at the patch panel, the LNB outputs interface to the fiber optic transmitter assemblies.   Fiberoptic LBand interfaculty links IFLs offer a high performance, cost effective alternative to conventional coaxialcabled systems. They cover the range of 950 to 2150 MHz and are used for transmission over single mode fiber optic cables of block downconverted C, extended C, X or Kuband signals. The fiberoptic IFL functions as a transparent link between the satellite antenna and the Network Operations Center NOC or control room. System limitations in using coaxial cable are overcome by the simplicity and performance of fiberoptic connections to provide the highest levels in signal quality.  The Value of Redundancy For a Super Headend content aggregator, such as SES Americom, providing a highly reliable service offering is paramount.  Meeting this requirement providing 11 redundant Integrated Receiver Decoders IRDs with switching. That may require row upon row of cabinets with up to 400 IRDs and switches as well as associated support equipment.  Because the content is coming from diverse providers, video formats and standards may vary.  Some of the programs will be analog and some will be digital. They may or may not be encrypted. Some analog signals will use the NTSC video format and some may be PAL or SECAM. For digital transmission, there may be programs that are in the clear and others that are encrypted. There will be programs that are standard definition and programs that are high definition.   All of these programs must be received and transformed into one common format and, therefore, final selection of Integrated Receiver Decoders IRDs depends on the channel lineup, who the content providers are, and where their resources are located, as well as other factors.  Because the telephone companies are new to providing television to their customer base, they are able to take advantage of the latest technological advances. The latest IPTV systems use advanced MPEG4 AVC H.264 compression techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements significantly as compared to legacy MPEG2 compression systems. These new encoders, repurposed specifically for IPTV, not only compress and encode the program channel, they also IPencapsulate the stream and output it via 10100 baseT Ethernet ports.  Each individual video channel is encoded, IPencapsulated and processed as a separate stream utilizing User Datagram Protocol UDP. Following that, all of the individual video channels are multiplexed together using an Ethernet Service Switch ESS and are distributed to regional headends or other edge location via fiber or by satellite. For an IPTV Super Headend such as SES The IPTV Revolution Page 6    www.globecommsystems.com  Americom, the most costeffective method of distribution to many headends is via satellite. In this case, a dedicated satellite with multiple IPTV transponders is used for distribution, with each transponder carrying a minimum of twenty standard definition program streams or one high definition and ten standard definition program streams. The transponders capacity can be improved using the new DVBS2 modulation standard.  Protecting Intellectual Property The IPTV Super Headend provider has to guarantee that the content owners valuable program material reaches only authorized paying customers. As a minimum, they have to provide a Conditional Access CA system that encrypts the programming over the satellite link.  They may instead provide a Digital Rights Management DRM system that protects the program material from the source to the subscriber.  Integrators of IPTV Super Headends are presently offering service providers the option to receive the content with managed middleware and CADRM provided along with product life cycle support. The decision as to what is ultimately provided depends upon the capabilities of the service provider telephone company.  The multichannel IPTV stream also requires automated monitoring to ensure signal quality during acquisition and distribution. Within the Network Operations Center NOC at the Super Headend, there is a video monitor wall that not only provides the visual indication of quality but also measures video and audio parameters for quality.  In addition, the Super Headend has IP transport test equipment such as an IP Multicast Media Analyzer, which monitors each stream at the headend for jitter and delay, and an IP Probe to monitor the downstream remote sites for packet arrival.   Satellites can and do play a significant role in content aggregation and distribution of IPTV to not only the telephone carrier community, but can also provide the same service to the enterprise and mobile markets.  Regional Headends  The Regional Headend RHE is the local gateway to IPTV programming for telephone companies, broadband carriers, enterprises, and other new entrants into video services. The Regional Headend provides for content acquisition, content management, subscriber management, packaging and delivery of the programming to the carriers distribution network. An effective RHE is also the access point for other revenue generating services including ad insertion and video on demand.   With the advent of IPTV Super Headends, a new model of operation has become available. In the old model, the Regional Headend negotiated for and purchased all programming, built a program acquisition facility for acquiring content, encoded and IPencapsulated all channels, purchased a Middleware System, and installed an Encryption System. The IPTV Revolution Page 7    www.globecommsystems.com   In the new model pioneered by SES Americom and Intelsat, the Regional Headend     Purchases prepackaged, bundled, programming  Builds a regional program acquisition facility consisting of one 3.7 to 4.5meter antenna  Acquires the packaged programming already MPEG4 encoded and IPencapsulated  Has the option to receive the content with managed middleware and CADRM provided  Has the option to receive product life cycle support  This approach offers low initial capital expenditure, a payasyougrow philosophy, proven technology, a proven integration solution, lower operating costs, aggregated buying, and one source for content and distribution rights  Assuming that the Regional Headend subscribes to the new model, small 3.7 to 4.5meter antennas are installed and pointed at the each satellite of interest carrying aggregated video content. Multiple edge receivers located within the Regional Headend acquire the IPTV streaming content where, typically, one Edge Receiver will downconvert a full satellite transponder with 20 to 25 programs standard definition in each IP stream.  The Edge Receiver subsystem is designed to monitor, aggregate and distribute the outputs of multiple receive streams simultaneously to an Ethernet Service Switch ESS for distribution to the subscriber base.  IPTV providers typically need to receive local channels either offair or via local cable or fiber sources and integrate them into the overall content provided to the subscribers. After local reception, the content must be digitized, encoded, IPencapsulated and aggregated for transfer to the ESS. All of these channels, as well as the channels received from the Super Headend, must be monitored to ensure signal quality during acquisition and distribution. This requires a multiview processing system that not only provides the visual indication of quality but also measures video and audio parameters for quality much the same as described for the Super Headend, but sized for the number of operating channels.  The Power of Middleware Unlike satellite Direct to Home DTH service, where the Conditional Access CA System is key to the operation of the system, IPTV networks are managed by a Middleware System. Middleware is the operating system of IPTV, which supplies all of the essential tools for endtoend management. The Middleware System is involved with service management, content management, subscriber management, marketing, transactional processing, data interchange and reporting and more. The IPTV Revolution Page 8    www.globecommsystems.com   IPTV Middleware interfaces with the operators legacy subscriber management and billing system.  As such, it is responsible for the management and creation of bundled packages of content, the pricing of packages, and the assignment of packages.  As a content manager, IPTV Middleware is used to create, configure and manage the metadata associated with the video content, determining asset location, integration of content synopsis, posters, trailers and is used to assign ratings and genres, and rate codes.   IPTV Middleware also provides for channel management, interfaces with the Electronic Program Guide, WEB portal and most important provides for the Graphical User Interface GUI and navigation system within the subscribers set top box.   Video on Demand  With todays demanding constraints on time, viewers prefer to watch programming when it is convenient rather than when it is broadcast. Videoondemand VOD provides the viewer with that option. Described as a killer application, IPTV videoondemand provides each user with a world of choices  not in more channels to view, but in the ability to enjoy what they want, when they want.  VOD is one of the most important valueadded products that the Regional Headend operator can offer subscribers.  It provides the viewer with the ability to pause, fastforward, and rewind programming as often as they like.   Satellite plays an important role with regard to VOD where content aggregators, such as TVN, pitch the content over satellite to catchers at video distribution headends.  At the Regional Headend, VOD servers are deployed so that frequently accessed content can be cached and delivered efficiently. As was the case for live content, Middleware is the central foundation for VOD as well. The VOD Server is the playout engine of the system.  It interfaces with the Middleware Server, which controls settop box STB configurations, channel lineups, and access to VOD content. The VOD Server also has the appropriate software to interface with the catcher in order to transfer the video assets and metadata on an automated basis.  Since VOD content can come from multiple sources, an Ingest Gateway is used to provide an appropriate interface to each of the incoming sources.  VOD content is delivered as a file transfer, which may be used upon receipt or stored for later use.  The incoming VOD usually consists of a package of two to three files. For example, the video andor audio source material is encoded and converted to a digital file with it is a metadata file of descriptive material about the content, and also a file that is sometimes known as a smile page, which provides the television user interface screen related to the content.  Local content is extremely important with regard to VOD services.  As a part of the Regional Headend providers offering, a local encoding studio can The IPTV Revolution Page 9    www.globecommsystems.com  generate local content for storage in the VOD Server. The local encoding studio includes VTRs and other playout equipment, MPEG encoders, metadata generation software, VOD file packaging software, and other enhancements.    The security and management of the VOD content is also critical, which requires the VOD System to interface with the existing CADRN system.  Interactive Enhancements  One of the main attractions of IPTV is its ability to provide a much richer television experience through its addressability and interactive functionality.  That interactive functionality includes  Provision of customized content both with streaming video and VOD. Instead of paying for channels that are rarely viewed, IPTV subscribers receive only those channels that they want.   Communications capabilities such as video telephony, email, chat, and other options are all available on the television screen  Multiple PictureinPicture PIP, with the option to chose any specific one and to change camera angles, follow a favorite sports player or watch a favorite car in a race.  Networked Gaming, where viewer can play any game they want, when they want, with whomever they want.  Home networking, where the viewer can control electronic devices within the home from the television screen or by remote web access.  Realtime shopping from the television set.  Targeted Advertising, where the operator knows the subscribers preferences along the lines of the Amazon.com model.  Interactive enhancements mean an added source of revenue for telephone carriers, greater subscriber satisfaction and lower churn, bringing benefits to the operator and subscriber alike.  Conditional Access and  Digital Rights Management  The ability to acquire licenses from content owners is critical to the IPTV service providers deployment plans. Content owners want assurance that their content is secure from piracy from the moment it leaves their hands to the instant that it is played out of the subscribers set top box. In order to provide that assurance, service providers must demonstrate that they are providing a totally secure conditionalaccess and digital rights management system from endtoend. At the same time, all of the elements associated with the IPTV distribution The IPTV Revolution Page 10    www.globecommsystems.com  network must be compatible with and integrate with the CADRM system,4 from the streaming video platform and the VOD platform to the middleware and the subscribers set top box.  The encryption process must ensure that the content stays encrypted and secure as it moves from one device to the next and at the same time guarantee that interactive options such as the VOD trick play pause, fast forward, rewind work without any problems.   IPTV Issues  In the rush to deploy IPTV, the major issue facing the new technology is the lack of standards. This is particularly strange since the telephone industry has always been standardsconscious and has previously had some of the most comprehensive industry standards available. As of today, there is no standardized solution for an endtoend system to deliver rich content over IP.5   Presently, all operational IPTV systems are operating as closed networks. The system elements are purchased from various providers, integrated together to insure interoperability, and placed into service. One manifestation of this lack of standards becomes evident when selecting set top boxes. Manufacturers must design their set top boxes to work with multiple middleware software providers, multiple CADRM providers, multiple compression schemes and multiple access networks. The number of permutations is too many to count.   For example, there are operational IPTV systems utilizing MPEG2, MPEG4 AVC H.264, Windows Media 9 VC1, and various other proprietary versions of video compression all marketed for IPTV.  Another area where standards could play a critical role is in the management of quality of service QoS, particularly in the metrics needed to create a reference design for endtoend QoS testing that takes all traffic into account.  Several organizations, such as the Alliance for Telecommunication Industry Solutions ATIS and the International Telecommunications Union ITU6, have announced that they will be developing standards for IPTV.  It remains an open question whether deployment will outrace the generation of these new standards.  As identified by the ATIS IPTV Interoperability Forum IIF there is a need for industryaccepted standardized metrics and requirements for content security and the quality of content delivery the need for endtoend QoS functionality to support multiple services on the same network and the need for interoperability standards and testing of components in the video delivery network.7  The IPTV Revolution Page 11    www.globecommsystems.com  The Future of IPTV and Satellites Role  With all of the major and many of the smaller telephone companies around the world either deploying or committed to deploying IPTV, it seems apparent that Internet Protocol Television is an important driver of digital convergence.  The catalyst for this transformation is the competitive environment that exists today because of MSOs providing triple play services to the telco customer base.  The emergence of IPTV is enabling telephone companies to rapidly transform their business model in order to compete and survive in this new environment.    While IPTV has been identified as the technology of the future for the transmission of television over telephone networks, these same fundamental concepts can be applied to Digital Cable Broadcast, Digital Multimedia Broadcast, DVBT, DVBH, Enterprise Networks, and other applications. This is because IPTV is a digitally convergent element of a much larger universal IP platform.  It therefore benefits from IPs fundamental architecture, which makes the transmission medium independent of the Internet layer.  Satellite has both a present and future opportunity to provide content aggregation and edge distribution via Super Headend providers. Satellite will also provide a key role in the delivery of videoondemand content to the edge. Northern Sky Research foresees a healthy niche market for IPTV via satellite that reaches over US500 million by 2010, up from only 50 million in 2005. This increase primarily will come from revenuesharing arrangements among satellitebased service providers, content providers, and IPTV service providers. Worldwide IPTV service revenue estimates vary anywhere from 17 billion to 38 billion by the year 2010, depending on whose report you read.  Forecasts aside, it is clear that IPTV Super Headends are presently in service and the future of Internet Protocol Television appears bright.
