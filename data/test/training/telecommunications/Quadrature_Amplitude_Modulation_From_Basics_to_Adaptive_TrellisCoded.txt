Introduction and Background
This book is concerned with the issues of transmitting digital signals via multilevel modu
lation. We will be concerned with digital signals originating from a range of sources such
as from speech or video encoding, or data from computers. A typical digital information
transmission system is shown in Figure 1.1. The source encoder may be used to remove
some of the redundancy which occurs in many sources such as speech, typically reducing
the transmission rate of the source. The forward error correction (FEC) block then paradox
ically inserts redundancy, but in a carefully controlled manner. This redundancy is in the
form of parity check bits, and allows the FEC decoder to remove transmission errors caused
by channel impairments, but at the cost of an increase in transmission rate. The interleaver
systematically rearranges the bits to be transmitted, which has the effect of dispersing a short
burst of errors at the receiver, allowing the FEC to work more effectively. Lastly, the modu
lator generates bandlimited waveforms which can be transmitted over the bandwidthlimited
channel to the receiver, where the reverse functions are performed. Whilst we will discuss
all aspects of Figure 1.1, it is the generation of waveforms in the modulator in a manner
which reduces errors and increases the transmission rate within a given bandwidth, and the
subsequent decoding in the demodulator, which will be our main concern in this book
It is assumed that the majority of readers will be familiar with binary modulation schemes
such as binary phase shift keying (BPSK), frequency shift keying (FSK), etc. Those readers
who possess this knowledge might like to jump to Section 1.2. For those who are not familiar
with modulation schemes we give a short non-mathematical explanation of modulation and
constellation diagrams before detailing the history of QAM
1.1 Modulation Methods
Suppose the data we wish to transmit is digitally encoded speech having a bit rate of 16 kbits
and after FEC coding the data rate becomes 32 kb/s. If the radio channel to be used is centred
around 1 GHz, then in order to transmit the 32 kb/s we must arrange for some feature of a
GHz carrier to change at the data rate of 32 kb/s. If the phase of the carrier is switched at the
rate of 32 kb/s, being at 0 deg and 180 deg for bits having logical 0 or logical 1, respectively

1.1. MODULATION METHODS

then there are 1 × 109/32 × 103 = 31, 250 radio frequency (RF) oscillations per bit trans
mitted. Figure 1.2(a) and (b) show the waveforms at the output of the modulator when the
data is a logical 0 and a logical 1, respectively. On the left is the phasor diagram for a logical

4 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
the logical 1 by a phasor along the negative x-axis. This negative phasor represents a phase
shift of the carrier by 180 deg. Figure 1.2(c) shows the modulator output for a sequence of
data bits. Note that no filtering is used in this introductory example. Here the waveform can
be seen to change abruptly at the boundary between some of the data symbols. We will see
later that such abrupt changes can be problematic since they theoretically require an infinite
bandwidth, and ways are sought to avoid them. Figure 1.2(d) is called a constellation diagram
of phasor points, and as we are transmitting binary data there are only two points. As these
two points are at equal distance from the origin we would expect them to represent equal
magnitude carriers, and that the magnitude is indeed constant can be seen in Figure c
The bandwidth of the modulated signal in this example will be in excess of the signalling

rate of 32 kb/s due to the sudden transition between phase states. Later we will consider the
bandwidth of modulated signals in-depth. Suffice to say here that if we decreased the sig
nalling rate to 16 kb/s the bandwidth of the modulated signal will decrease. If the data rate is
32 kb/s, and the signalling rate becomes 16 kb/s, then every symbol transmitted must carry
two bits of information. This means that we must have four points on the constellation, and
clearly this can be done in many ways. Figure 1.3 shows some four-point constellations. The
two bits of information associated with every constellation point are marked on the figure. In
Figure 1.3(a) and (b) so-called quadrature modulation has been used as the points can only
be uniquely described using two orthogonal coordinate axes, each passing through the origin
The orthogonal coordinate axes have a phase rotation of 90 deg with respect to each other
and hence they have a so-called quadrature relationship. The pair of coordinate axes can be
associated with a pair of quadrature carriers, normally a sine and a cosine waveform, which
can be independently modulated and then transmitted within the same frequency band. Due
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
to their orthogonality they can be separated by the receiver. This implies that whatever sym
bol is chosen on one axis (say the x-axis in the case of Figure 1.3(a)) it will have no effect
on the data demodulated on the y-axis. Data can therefore be independently transmitted via
these two quadrature or orthogonal channels without any increase in error rate, although some
increase may result in practice and this is considered in later chapters. We have used I and
Q to signify the in-phase and quadrature components, respectively, where in-phase normally
represents the x-axis and quadrature the y-axis. Figure 1.3(c) and (d) show constellations
where the four points are only on one line. These are not quadrature constellations but ac
tually represent multilevel amplitude and phase modulation where both the carrier amplitude
and phase can take two discrete values
For the constellations in Figure 1.3(a) and (b) we have a constant amplitude signal, but
the carrier phase values at the beginning of each symbol period in Figure 1.3(b) would be
either 45 deg, 135 deg, 225 deg or315 deg. There are two magnitude values and two phase
values for the constellations in Figure 1.3(c) and d
In order to reduce the bandwidth of the modulated signal whilst maintaining the same
information transmission rate we can further decrease the symbol rate by adding more points
in the constellation. Such a reduction in the bandwidth requirement will allow us to transmit
more information in the spectrum we have been allocated. Such capability is normally con
sidered advantageous. If we combine the constellations of Figure 1.3(c) and (d) we obtain the
square QAM constellation having four bits per constellation point as displayed in Figure
We will spend much time in dealing with this constellation in this book. In general, grouping
n bits into one signalling symbol yields 2n constellation points, which are often referred to
as phasors, or complex vectors. The phasors associated with these points may have different
amplitude and/or phase values, and this type of modulation is therefore referred to as multi
level modulation, where the number of levels is equal to the number of constellation points
After transmission through the channel the receiver must identify the phasor transmitted, and
in doing so can determine the constellation point and hence the bits associated with this point
In this way the data is recovered. There are many problems with attempting to recover data
transmitted over both fixed channels such as telephone lines and radio channels and many of
these problems are given a whole chapter in this book. These problems are generally exacer
bated by changing from binary to multilevel modulation, and this is why binary modulation
is often preferred, despite its lower capacity. In order to introduce these problems, and to
provide a historical perspective to quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a brief history
of the development of QAM is presented
1.2 History of Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
1.2.1 Determining the Optimum Constellation
Towards the end of the 1950s there was a considerable amount of interest in digital phase
modulation transmission schemes [1] as an alternative to digital amplitude modulation. Dig
ital phase modulation schemes are those whereby the amplitude of the transmitted carrier is
held constant but the phase changed in response to the modulating signal. Such schemes have
constellation diagrams of the form shown in Figure 1.3(a). It was a natural extension of this
trend to consider the simultaneous use of both amplitude and phase modulation. The first
paper to suggest this idea was by C.R. Cahn in 1960, who described a combined phase and
6 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Figure 1.4: Square QAM constellation
amplitude modulation system [2]. He simply extended phase modulation to the multilevel
case by allowing there to be more than one transmitted amplitude at any allowed phase. This
had the effect of duplicating the original phase modulation or phase shift keying (PSK) con
stellation which essentially formed a circle. Such duplication led to a number of concentric
circles depending on the number of amplitude levels selected. Each circle had the same num
ber of phase points on each of its rings. Only Gaussian channels characteristic of telephone
lines impaired by thermal noise were considered. Using a series of approximations and a
wholly theoretical approach, he came to the conclusion that these amplitude and phase mod
ulation (AM-PM) systems allowed an increased throughput compared to phase modulation
systems when 16 or more states were used and suggested that such a system was practical to
construct
1.2.1.1 Coherent and Non-Coherent Reception
The fundamental problem with PSK is that of determining the phase of the transmitted signal
and hence decoding the transmitted information. This problem is also known as carrier re
covery as an attempt is made to recover the phase of the carrier. When a phase point at, say
90 deg is selected to reflect the information being transmitted, the phase of the transmitted
carrier is set to 90 deg. However, the phase of the carrier is often changed by the transmission
channel with the result that the receiver measures a different phase. This means that unless
the receiver knew what the phase change imposed by the channel was it would be unable to
determine the encoded information
This problem can be overcome in one of two ways. The first is to measure the phase
change imposed by the channel by a variety of means. The receiver can then determine the
transmitted phase. This is known as coherent detection. The second is to transmit differences
in phase, rather than absolute phase. The receiver then merely compares the previous phase
with the current phase and the phase change of the channel is removed. This assumes that
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
any phase change within the channel is relatively slow. This differential system is known as
non-coherent transmission. In his paper, Cahn considered both coherent and noncoherent
transmission, although for coherent transmission he assumed a hypothetical and unrealisable
perfect carrier recovery device. The process of carrier recovery is considered in Chapter
and the details of differential transmission are explained in Chapter
1.2.1.2 Clock Recovery
Alongside carrier recovery runs the problem of clock recovery. The recovered clock signal is
used to ensure appropriate sampling of the received signal. In Figure 1.2(c) a carrier signal
was shown which had vertical lines indicating each bit or symbol period. It was the phase
at the start of this period which was indicative of the encoded information. Unfortunately
the receiver has no knowledge of when these periods occur although it might know their
approximate duration. It is determining these symbol periods which is the task of clock
recovery. So carrier recovery estimates the phase of the transmitted carrier and clock recovery
estimates the instances at which the data changes from one symbol to another. Whilst the need
for carrier recovery can be removed through differential or non-coherent detection, there is
no way to remove the requirement for clock recovery
Clock recovery schemes tend to seek certain periodicities in the received signal and use
these to estimate the start of a symbol (actually they often attempt to select the centre of
a symbol for reasons which will be explained in later chapters). Clock recovery is often
a complex procedure, and poor clock recovery can substantially increase the bit error rate
(BER). The issue of clock recovery is considered in Chapter 6. In his work, Cahn overcame
the problem of clock recovery by assuming that he had some device capable of perfect clock
recovery. Such devices do not exist, so Cahn acknowledged that the error rate experienced in
practice would be worse than the value he had calculated, but as he was unable to compute
the errors introduced by a practical clock recovery system, this was the only course open to
him
1.2.1.3 The Type I, II and III Constellations
A few months later a paper was published by Hancock and Lucky [3] in which they expanded
upon the work of Cahn. In this paper they realised that the performance of the circular type
constellation could be improved by having more points on the outer ring than on the inner
ring. The rationale for this was that errors were caused when noise introduced into the signal
moved the received phasor from the transmitted constellation point to a different one. The
further apart constellation points could be placed, the less likely this was to happen. In
Cahn’s constellation, points on the inner ring were closest together in distance terms and so
most vulnerable to errors. They conceded that a system with unequal numbers of points on
each amplitude ring would be more complicated to implement, particularly in the case of
non-coherent detection. They called the constellation proposed by Cahn a Type I system, and
theirs a Type II system. Again using a mathematical approach they derived results similar to
Cahn’s for Type I systems and a 3 dB improvement for the Type II over the Type I system
The next major publication was some 18 months later, in 1962, by Campopiano and
Glazer [4]. They developed on the work of the previous papers but also introduced a new
constellation - the square QAM system, which they termed a Type III system. They described
8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Figure 1.5: Examples of types I, II and III QAM constellations
this system as “essentially the amplitude modulation and demodulation of two carriers that
have the same frequency but are in quadrature with each other” - the first time that combined
amplitude and phase modulation had been thought of as amplitude modulation on quadrature
carriers, although the acronym QAM was not suggested. They realised that the problem with
their Type III system was that it had to be used in a phase coherent mode, that is noncoherent
detection was not possible and so carrier recovery was necessary. Again, a theoretical analysis
was performed for Gaussian noise channels and the authors came to the conclusion that the
Type III system offered a very small improvement in performance over the Type II system
but thought that the implementation of the Type III system would be considerably simpler
than that of Types I and II. Examples of the different types of constellation are shown in
Figure
Three months later another paper was published by Hancock and Lucky [5] in which they
were probably unaware of the work done by Campopiano and Glazer. They attempted to
improve on their previous work on the Type II system by carrying out a theoretical analysis
supposedly leading to the optimal constellation for Gaussian channels. In this paper they de
cided that the optimum 16-level constellation had two amplitude rings with eight equispaced
points on each ring but with the rings shifted by 22.5 deg from each other. This constellation
is shown in Figure
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
Figure 1.6: Optimum 16-level constellation according to Lucky [5] c©IRE,
Again, they concluded that 16 was the minimum number of levels for AM-PM modulation
and that a SNR of at least 11 dB was required for efficient operation with a low probability
of bit error
After this paper there was a gap of nine years before any further significant advances were
published. This was probably due to the difficulties in implementing QAM systems with the
technology available and also because the need for increased data throughput was not yet
pressing. During this period the work discussed in the above papers was consolidated into a
number of books, particularly that by Lucky, Salz and Weldon [6]. Here they clearly distin
guished between quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes using square constella
tions and combined amplitude and phase modulation schemes using circular constellations
It was around this period that the acronym QAM started appearing in common usage along
with AM-PM to describe the different constellations
One of the earliest reports of the actual construction of a QAM system came from Salz
Sheenhan and Paris [7] of Bell Labs in 1971. They implemented circular constellations with
4 and 8 phase positions and 2 and 4 amplitude levels using coherent and non-coherent demod
ulation. Neither carrier nor clock recovery was attempted. Their results showed reasonable
agreement with the theoretical results derived up to that time. This work was accompanied by
that of Ho and Yeh [8] who improved the theory of circular AM-PM systems with algorithms
that could be solved on digital computers which were by that time becoming increasingly
available
Interest in QAM remained relatively low, however, until 1974. In that year there was
a number of significant papers published, considerably extending knowledge about quadra
ture amplitude modulation schemes. At this time, interest into optimum constellations was
revived with two papers, one from Foschini, Gitlin and Weinstein [9] and the other from
Thomas, Weidner and Durrani [10]. Foschini et al. attempted a theoretical derivation of the
ideal constellation using a gradient calculation approach. They came to the conclusion that
10 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Figure 1.7: Optimum 16-level constellation according to Foschini [9] c©IEEE,
the ideal constellation was based around an equilateral triangle construction leading to the
unusual 16-level constellation shown in Figure 1.7. This constellation has not found favour
in practical applications, since the complexities involved in its employment outweigh the
associated gains that were claimed for it
Their conclusions were that this constellation, when limited in terms of power and op
erated over Gaussian channels, offered a performance improvement of 0.5 dB over square
QAM constellations. Meanwhile Thomas et al., working at COMSAT, empirically generated
29 constellations and compared their error probabilities
1.2.2 Satellite Links
In the paper by Thomas et al. [10] they also mentioned the first application of QAM, for use
in satellite links. Satellite links have a particular problem in that satellites only have a limited
power available to them. Efficient amplifiers are necessary to use this power carefully, and
these had tended to employ a device known as a travelling wave tube (TWT). Such a device
introduces significant distortion in the transmitted signal and Thomas et al. considered the
effects of this distortion on the received waveform. They came to the interesting conclusion
that the Type II constellation (in this case 3 points on the inner ring and 5 on the outer) was
inferior to the Type I (4 points on inner and outer rings) due to the increased demand in
peak-to-average power ratio of the Type II constellation. Their overall conclusion was that
circular Type I constellations are superior in all cases. When they considered TWT distortion
they discovered that AM-PM schemes were inferior to PSK schemes because of the need to
significantly back off the amplifier to avoid severe amplitude distortion, and concluded that
better linear amplifiers would be required before AM-PM techniques could be successfully
used for satellite communications. They also considered the difficulties of implementing
various carrier recovery techniques, advising that decision directed carrier recovery would
be most appropriate, although few details were given as to how this was to be implemented
Decision directed carrier recovery is a process whereby the decoded signal is compared with
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
the closest constellation point and the phase difference between them is used to estimate the
error in the recovered carrier. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter
Commensurate with the increasing interest as to possible applications for QAM were the
two papers published in 1974 by Simon and Smith which concentrated on carrier recovery and
detection techniques. In the first of these [11] they noted the interest in QAM that was then
appearing for bandlimited systems, and addressed the problems of carrier recovery. They
considered only the 16-level square constellation and noted that the generation of a highly
accurate reconstructed carrier was essential for adequate performance. Their solution was to
demodulate the signal, quantise it, and then establish the polarity of error from the nearest
constellation point, and use it to update the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) used in the
carrier generation section. They provided a theoretical analysis and concluded that their car
rier recovery technique worked well in the case of high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio Gaussian
noise, although they noted that gain control was required and would considerably complicate
the implementation. They extended their work in Reference [12] where they considered off
set QAM or O-QAM. In this modulation scheme the signal to one of the quadrature arms was
delayed by half a symbol period in an attempt to prevent dramatic fluctuations of the signal
envelope, which was particularly useful in satellite communications. They noted similar re
sults for their decision directed carrier recovery scheme as when non-offset modulation was
used
1.2.2.1 Odd-Bit Constellations
Despite all the work on optimum constellations, by 1975 interest had centred on the square
QAM constellation. The shape of this was evident for even numbers of bits per symbol, but
if there was a requirement for an odd number of bits per symbol to be transmitted, the ideal
shape of the constellation was not obvious, with rectangular constellations having been tenta
tively suggested. Early in 1975 J.G. Smith, also working on satellite applications, published
a paper addressing this problem [13]. He noted that for even numbers of bits per symbol the
square constellation was the only viable choice.” In this paper he showed that what he termed
“symmetric” constellations offered about a 1 dB improvement over rectangular constellations
and he considered both constellations to be of the same implementational complexity. Fig
ure 1.8 shows an example of his symmetric constellation when there are 5 bits per symbol
1.2.3 QAM Modem Implementations
About this time, the Japanese started to show interest in QAM schemes as they considered
they might have application in both satellite and microwave radio links. In 1976 Miyauchi
Seki and Ishio published a paper devoted to implementation techniques [14]. They consid
ered implementation by superimposing two 4-level PSK modulation techniques at different
amplitudes to achieve a square QAM constellation and using a similar process in reverse at
the demodulator, giving them the advantage of being able to use existing PSK modulator
and demodulator circuits. This method of implementing QAM is discussed in Chapter
They implemented a prototype system without clock or carrier recovery and concluded that
its performance was sufficiently good to merit further investigation. Further groundwork was
covered in 1978 by W. Weber, again working on satellite applications, who considered differ
12 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Figure 1.8: Optimum 32-level constellation according to Smith [13] c©IEEE,
ential (i.e. non-coherent) encoding systems for the various constellations still in favour
His paper essentially added a theoretical basis to the differential techniques that had been in
use at that point, although suggesting that non-coherent demodulation techniques deserved
more attention
In late 1979 evidence of the construction of QAM prototype systems worldwide started
to emerge. A paper from the CNET laboratories in France by Dupuis et al. [16] considered
a 140 Mbit/s modem for use in point-to-point links in the 10-11 GHz band. This prototype
employed the square 16-level constellation and included carrier recovery, although no details
were given. Theoretical calculations of impairments were presented followed by measure
ments made over a 58 km hop near Paris. Their conclusions were that QAM had a number
of restrictions in its use, relating to its sensitivity to non-linearities, and that in the form they
had implemented it, PSK offered improved performance. However, they suggested that with
further work these problems might be overcome
The Japanese simultaneously announced results from a prototype 200 Mbit/s QAM
system in a paper by Horikawa, Murase and Saito [17]. They used differential coding cou
pled with a new form of carrier recovery based on a decision feedback method detailed
in Chapter 6). Their modem was primarily designed for satellite applications and their ex
periment included the use of TWT amplifiers, but was only carried out back-to-back in the
laboratory. Their conclusions were that their prototype had satisfactory performance and was
an efficient way to increase bandwidth efficiency
One of the last of the purely theoretical, as opposed to practical papers on QAM ap
peared in April 1980, marking the progression of QAM from a technical curiosity into a
practical system, some twenty years after its introduction. This came from V. Prabhu of
Bell Labs [18], further developing the theory to allow calculation of error probabilities in
the presence of co-channel interference. Prabhu concluded that 16-QAM had a cochannel
interference immunity superior to 16-PSK but inferior to PSK
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
1.2.3.1 Non-Linear Amplification
In 1982 there came a turning point in the use of QAM for satellite applications when Feher
turned his attention to this problem. His first major publication in this field [19] introduced
a new method of generation of QAM signals using highly non-linear amplifiers which he
termed non-linear amplified QAM (NLA-QAM). Two separate amplifiers for the QAM
case were used, one operating with half the output power of the other. The higher power
amplifier coded the two most significant bits of the 4-bit symbol only, and the lower power
amplifier coded only the two least significant bits. The amplified coded signals were then
summed at full output power to produce the QAM signal. Because both amplifiers were
therefore able to use constant envelope modulation they could be run at full power with re
sulting high efficiency, although with increased complexity due to the need for two amplifiers
and a hybrid combiner, compared to previous systems which used only a single amplifier
However, in satellite applications, complexity was relatively unimportant compared to power
efficiency, and this NLA technique offered a very substantial 5 dB power gain, considerably
increasing the potential of QAM in severely power limited applications
1.2.3.2 Frequency Selective Fading and Channel Equalisers
This work was soon followed by a performance study of a NLA 64-state system [20] which
extended the NLA scheme to 64 levels by using three amplifiers all operating at different
power levels. Performance estimates were achieved using computer simulation techniques
which included the effects of frequency selective fading
Frequency selective fading is essentially caused when there are a number of propagation
paths between the transmitter and receiver, imposed for example by the reflection of the radio
waves from nearby buldings or mountains. When the time delay of the longest path compared
to that of the shortest path becomes comparable to a symbol period, intersymbol interference
(ISI) arises. Since every time domain effect has an equivalent frequency domain effect, which
are related to eachother through the Fourier transform, a dispersive channel impulse response
results into an undulating frequency-domain channel transfer function, where the correspond
ing frequency-domain fluctuations are also referred to as ’frequency-selective’ fading. This
frequency-selective fading phenomenon may be mitigated with the aid of adaptive channel
equaliser techniques, which attempt to remove the channel-induced ISI. They do so by cal
culating the ISI introduced and then subtracting it from the received signals. They are often
extremely complex devices and are considered in detail in Chapter
On a historical note, in the context of linear equalizers pioneering work was carried out
amongst other researchers by Tufts [21], where the design of the transmitter and receiver was
jointly optimised. The optimisation was based on the minimisation of the MSE between the
transmitted signal and the equalized signal. This was achieved under the Zero Forcing ZF
condition, where the ISI was completely mitigated at the sampling instances. Subsequently
Smith [22] introduced a similar optimisation criterion with and without applying the ZF con
dition. Similar works as a result of these pioneering contributions were achieved by amongst
others Hänsler [23], Ericson [24] and Forney
The development of the DFE was initiated by the idea of using previous detected symbols
to compensate for the ISI in a dispersive channel, which was first proposed by Austin
This idea was adopted by Monsen [27], who managed to optimise the DFE based on minimiz
ing the MSE between the equalized symbol and the transmitted symbol. The optimisation of
14 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
the DFE based on joint minimization of both the noise and ISI was undertaken by Salz
which was subsequently extended to QAM systems by Falconer and Foschini [29]. At about
the same time, Price [30] optimised the DFE by utilizing the so-called ZF criterion, where all
the ISI was compensated by the DFE. The pioneering work achieved so far assumed perfect
decision feedback and that the number of taps of the DFE was infinite. A more compre
hensive history of the linear equalizer and the DFE can be found in the classic papers by
Lucky [31] or by Belfiore [32] and a more recent survey was produced by Qureshi
In recent years, there has not been much development on the structure of the linear and
decision feedback equalizers. However considerable effort has been given to the investigation
of adaptive algorithms that are used to adapt the equalizers according to the prevalent CIR
These contributions will be elaborated in the next chapter. Nevertheless, some interesting
work on merging the MLSE detectors with the DFE has been achieved by Cheung et al
[34,35], Wu et al. [36,37] and Gu et al. [38]. In these contributions, the structure of the MLSE
and DFE was merged in order to yield an improved BER performance, when compared to the
DFE, albeit at the cost of increased complexity. However, the complexity incurred was less
when compared to that of the MLSE
In the context of error propagation in the DFE, which will be explained in Chapter
this phenomenon has been reported and researched in the past by Duttweiler et al. [39] and
more recently by Smee et al. [40] and Altekar et al. [41]. In this respect some solutions have
been proposed by amongst others, Tomlinson [42], Harashima [43], Russell et al. [44] and
Chiani [45], in reducing the impact of error propagation
1.2.3.3 History of Blind Equalisation
The philosophy of channel equalisation is that the transmitter sends known so-called channel
sounding symbols to the receiver. Upon receiving these known symbols the receiver typically
evaluates the difference between the pre-agreed transmitted signal as well as the received
signal and uses this error signal for adaptively adjusting the response of the equaliser, so that
it eliminates the channel-induced ISI. When the wireless channel’s impulse response changes
rapidly, the channel’s response has to be estimated at regular intervals, which requires the
frequent transmission of redundant channel-sounding symbols
By contrast, the principle of blind equalization is that no known channel-sounding sym
bols are transmitted over the channel for the sake of estimating its response, which allows the
system to maximise its effective throughput. This blind equalisation concept was originally
proposed by Sato [46]. Five years after Sato’s publication, the blind equalization problem
was further studied for example by Benveniste, Goursat and Ruget in [47], where several
blind equalization issues were clarified and a new algorithm was proposed [48]. At the same
time Godard [49] introduced a criterion, namely the so-called “constant modulus” (CM) cri
terion, leading to a new class of blind equalizers. Following Godard’s contribution a range
of studies were conducted employing the constant modulus criterion. Foschini [50] was the
first researcher studying the convergence properties of Godard’s equalizer upon assuming
an infinite equalizer length. Later, Ding et al. continued this study [51] and provided an
indepth analysis of the convergence issue in the context of a realistic equalizer. Although
numerous researchers studied this issue, nevertheless, a general solution is yet to be found
A plethora of authors have studied Godard’s equalizer, rendering it the most widely studied
blind equalizer. A well–known algorithm of the so-called Bussgang type [52, 53] was also
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
proposed by Picchi and Prati [54]. Their “Stop-and-Go” algorithm constitutes a combination
of the Decision-Directed algorithm [55] with Sato’s algorithm [46]. After 1991, a range of
different solutions to the blind equalization problem were proposed. Seshadri [56] suggested
the employment of the so-called M -algorithm, as a “substitute” for the Viterbi algorithm
for the blind scenario, combined with the so-called “least mean squares (LMS)” based CIR
estimation. This CIR estimation was replaced by “recursive least squares (RLS)” estimation
by Raheli, Polydoros and Tzou [58], combining the associated convolutional decoding with
the CIR estimation, leading to what was termed as “Per-Survivor Processing”. Since then
a number of papers have focused on this technique [58–67]. At the same time as Seshadri
Tong et al. [68] proposed a different approach to blind equalization, which used oversampling
in order to create a so-called “cyclostationary” received signal, and performed CIR estima
tion by measuring the autocorrelation function of this signal and by exploiting this signals
cyclostationarity. This technique was also applied to the case of ‘sampling’ the received sig
nals of different antennas (instead of oversampling the signal of a single antenna) and further
extended by Moulines et al. using a different method of CIR estimation, namely the so
called subspace method in [69]. Furthermore, Tsatsanis and Giannakis suggested that the
cyclostationarity can be induced by the transmitter upon transmitting the signal more than
once [70]. A number of further contributions have also been published in the context of these
techniques [71–86]. Finally, nearly coincidentally with Seshadri [56] and Tong et al.
Hatzinakos and Nikias [87] proposed a more sophisticated approach to blind equalization by
exploiting the so-called “tricepstrum” of the received signal. Until today, the blind equaliza
tion problem is an open research topic, attracting significant amount of research. A general
answer to the fundamental question “Under what circumstances is it preferable to use a blind
equalizer to a trained–equalizer ?” is yet to be provided. Despite the scarcity of reviews on
the topic, in the context of the Global System of Mobile Communications known as GSM
an impressive effort was made by Boss, Kammeyer and Petermann [88], who also proposed
two novel blind algorithms. We recommend furthermore the fractionally–spaced equaliza
tion review of Endres et al. [89] and the Constant Modulus overview of Johnson et al.
based on a specific type of equalizers, namely on the so-called “fractionally-spaced” equal
izers. A review of subspace–ML multichannel blind equalizers was provided by Tong and
Perreau [91]. Further important references are the monograph by Haykin [55], the relevant
section by Proakis [92] and the blind deconvolution book due to Nandi [93]. Comparative per
formance studies between various blind equalizers have also been performed. We recommend
the second–order statistics-based comparative performance studies of Becchetti et al.
Kristensson et al. [95] and Altuna et al. [96], which is based on the mobile environment as
well as the second–order statistics and PSP-based comparative study of Skowratanont and
Chambers [97]. Furthermore, we recommend the fractionally–spaced Bussgang algorithm
based comparative performance study by Shynk et al. [98], the CMA comparative perfor
mance study of Schirtzinger et al. [99] and the comparative convergence study by Endres et
al.
1.2.3.4 Filtering
In a book published around this time [101], Feher also suggested the use of non-linear fil
tering (NLF) for QAM satellite communications. Since the I and Q components of the time
domain QAM signal change their amplitude abruptly at the signalling intervals their trans
16 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
mission would require an infinite bandwidth. These abrupt changes are typically smoothed
by a bandlimiting filter. The design an implementation of such filters is critical, particu
larly when the NLA-QAM signal is filtered at high power level. In order to alleviate these
problems Feher developed the NLF technique along with Huang in 1979 which simplified
filter design by simply fitting a quarter raised cosine segment between two initially abruptly
changing symbols for both of the quadrature carriers. We have already hinted that filtering is
required to prevent abrupt changes in the transmitted signal. This issue is considered in more
rigour in Chapter 4. This allowed the generation of jitter-free bandlimited signals, which
had previously been a problem, improving clock recovery techniques. Feher’s work contin
ued to increase the number of levels used, with a paper on 256-QAM in May 1985
noting the problems that linear group delay distortion caused, and a paper in April 1986 on
512-QAM [103] which came to similar conclusions
1.2.4 Advanced Prototypes
Work was still continuing in France, Japan and also in New Zealand. CNET were continu
ing their attempt to overcome the problems they had found in their initial trials reported in
1979. A paper published in 1985 by M. Borgne [104] compared the performance of 16,
64 and 128 level QAM schemes using computer simulation with particular interest in the im
pairments likely to occur over point-to-point radio links. Borgne concluded that nonlinearity
cancellers and adaptive equalisers would be necessary for this application. Soon after this, the
first major paper on adaptive equalisers for QAM was published by Shafi and Moore
Much of this paper was concerned with clock and carrier recovery without going into detail
as to how these operations were performed. Details were provided of a fractional decision
feedback equaliser (DFE) which they considered suitable for point-to-point radio links. They
concluded that carrier recovery and clock timing was critical and likely to cause major prob
lems, which were somewhat ameliorated by their fractionally spaced system
Although lagging somewhat behind Feher, the Japanese made up for this delay by pub
lishing a very detailed paper describing the development of a 256-level QAM modem in Au
gust 1986. In this paper from Saito and Nakamura [106], the authors developed on the work
announced in 1979 by Saito et al. [14] which was discussed earlier. In this new paper they
detailed automatic gain control (which he termed automatic threshold control) and carrier
recovery methods. The carrier recovery was a slight enhancement to the system announced
in 1979 and the AGC system was based on decision directed methods. Details were given as
to how false lock problems were avoided (see Chapter 6) and the back-to-back prototype ex
periments gave results which the authors considered showed the feasibility of the QAM
modem. Evidence of the ever increasing interest in QAM was that in the IEEE special issue
on advances in digital communications by radio there was a substantial section devoted to
high-level modulation techniques. In a paper by Rustako et al. [107] which considered point
to-point applications, the standard times-two carrier recovery method for binary modulation
was expanded for QAM. The authors claimed the advantage of not requiring accurate data
decisions or interacting with any equaliser. They acknowledged that their system had the
disadvantage of slow reacquisition after fades and suggested that it would only be superior in
certain situations. This form of carrier recovery is considered in some detail in Chapter
Clearly, until the late 1980s developments were mainly targeted at telephone line and
point-to-point radio applications, which led to the definition of the CCITT telephone circuit
1.2. HISTORY OF QAM
modem standards V.29 to V.33 based on various QAM constellations ranging from uncoded
16-QAM to trellis coded (TC) 128-QAM. The basic concept of coded modulation is intro
duced in Chapter 8 along with the members of CCITT standard V-series modem scheme
family, including the V.29 - V.33 modems designed for telephone lines
1.2.5 QAM for Wireless Communications
Another major development occurred in 1987 when Sundberg, Wong and Steele published
a pair of papers [108, 109] considering QAM for voice transmission over Rayleigh fading
channels, the first major paper considering QAM for mobile radio applications. In these
papers, it was recognized that when a Gray code mapping scheme was used, some of the bits
constituting a symbol had different error rates from other bits. Gray coding is a method of
assigning bits to be transmitted to constellation points in an optimum manner and is discussed
in Chapter 5. For the 16-level constellation two classes of bits occurred, for the level
three classes and so on. Efficient mapping schemes for pulse code modulated (PCM) speech
coding were discussed where the most significant bits (MSBs) were mapped onto the class
with the highest integrity. A number of other schemes including variable threshold systems
and weighted systems were also discussed. Simulation and theoretical results were compared
and found to be in reasonable agreement. They used no carrier recovery, clock recovery
or AGC, assuming these to be ideal, and came to the conclusion that channel coding and
post-enhancement techniques would be required to achieve acceptable performance
This work was continued, resulting in a publication in 1990 by Hanzo, Steele and For
tune [110], again considering QAM for mobile radio transmission, where again a theoretical
argument was used to show that with a Gray encoded square constellation, the bits encoded
onto a single symbol could be split into a number of subclasses, each subclass having a dif
ferent average BER. The authors then showed that the difference in BER of these different
subclasses could be reduced by constellation distortion at the cost of slightly increased total
BER, but was best dealt with by using different error correction powers on the different
QAM subclasses. A 16 kbit/s sub-band speech coder was subjected to bit sensitivity analysis
and the most sensitive bits identified were mapped onto the higher integrity 16-QAM sub
classes, relegating the less sensitive speech bits to the lower integrity classes. Furthermore
different error correction coding powers were considered for each class of bits to optimise
performance. Again ideal clock and carrier recovery were used, although this time the prob
lem of automatic gain control (AGC) was addressed. It was suggested that as bandwidth
became increasingly congested in mobile radio, microcells would be introduced supplying
the required high SNRs with the lack of bandwidth being an incentive to use QAM
In the meantime, CNET were still continuing their study of QAM for point-to-point appli
cations, and Sari and Moridi published a paper [111] detailing an improved carrier recovery
system using a novel combination of phase and frequency detectors which seemed promis
ing. However, interest was now increasing in QAM for mobile radio usage and a paper was
published in 1989 by J. Chuang of Bell Labs [112] considering NLF-QAM for mobile radio
and concluding that NLF offered slight improvements over raised cosine filtering when there
was mild intersymbol interference ISI
A technique, known as the transparent tone in band method (TTIB) was proposed by
McGeehan and Bateman [113] from Bristol University, UK, which facilitated coherent de
tection of the square QAM scheme over fading channels and was shown to give good per
18 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
formance but at the cost of an increase in spectral occupancy. This important technique is
discussed in depth in Chapter 10. At an IEE colloquium on multilevel modulation techniques
in March 1990 a number of papers were presented considering QAM for mobile radio and
point-to-point applications. Matthews [114] proposed the use of a pilot tone located in the
centre of the frequency band for QAM transmissions over mobile channels
Huish discussed the use of QAM over fixed links, which was becoming increasingly
widespread [115]. Webb et al. presented two papers describing the problems of square
QAM constellations when used for mobile radio transmissions and introduced the star QAM
constellation with its inherent robustness in fading channels [116,
During the 1990s a number of publications emerged, describing various techniques de
signed for enhancing the achievable performance of QAM transmissions schemes, when com
municating over mobile radio channels. All of these techniques are described in detail in
Part II of the book, namely in Chapters 9 - 13. In December 1991 a paper appeared in the IEE
Proceedings [118] which considered the effects of channel coding, trellis coding and block
coding when applied to the star QAM constellation. This was followed by another paper
in the IEE Proceedings [119] considering equaliser techniques for QAM transmissions over
dispersive mobile radio channels. A review paper appearing in July 1992 [120] considered
areas where QAM could be put to most beneficial use within the mobile radio environment
and concluded that its advantages would be greatest in microcells. Further work on spectral
efficiency, particularly of multilevel modulation schemes [121] concluded that variable level
QAM modulation was substantially more efficient than all the other modulation schemes sim
ulated. Variable level QAM was first discussed in a paper by Steele and Webb in 1991
Further QAM schemes for hostile fading channels characteristic of mobile telephony can
be found in the following recent references [123–134, 134–157]. If Feher’s previously men
tioned NLA concept cannot be applied, then power-inefficient class A or AB linear amplifi
cation has to be used, which might become an impediment in lightweight, lowconsumption
handsets. However, the power consumption of the low-efficiency class A amplifier
is less critical than that of the digital speech and channel codecs. In many applications
QAM, transmitting 4 bits per symbol reduces the signalling rate by a factor of 4 and hence
mitigates channel dispersion, thereby removing the need for an equaliser, while the higher
SNR demand can be compensated by diversity reception
Significant contributions were made by Cavers, Stapleton et al. at Simon Fraser Uni
versity, Burnaby, Canada in the field of pre- and post-distorter design. Out-of-band emis
sions due to class AB amplifier non-linearities and hence adjacent channel interferences can
be reduced by some 15-20 dB using Stapleton’s adaptive predistorter [134, 134, 135] and a
class AB amplifier with 6 dB back-off, by adjusting the predistorter’s adaptive coefficients
using the complex convolution of the predistorter’s input signal and the amplifier’s output sig
nal. Further aspects of linearised power amplifier design are considered in references
and
A further important research trend is hallmarked by Cavers’ work targeted at pilot symbol
assisted modulation (PSAM) [138], where known pilot symbols are inserted in the informa
tion stream in order to allow the derivation of channel measurement information. The recov
ered received symbols are then used to linearly predict the channel’s attenuation and phase
This arrangement will be considered in Chapter 10. A range of advanced QAM modems
have also been proposed by Japanese researchers doing cutting-edge research in the field
including Sampei et al. [127, 128, 139, 140], Adachi [141] et al. and Sasaoka et al.
1.3. HISTORY OF NEAR-INSTANTANEOUSLY ADAPTIVE QAM
Since QAM research has reached a mature stage, a number of mobile speech, audio and
video transmission schemes have been proposed [156–168]. These system design examples
demonstrated that substantial system performance benefits accrue, when the entire system
is jointly optimised, rather than just a conglomerate of independent system components. A
range of digital video broadcasting (DVB) schemes will be the topic of Chapter
1.3 History of Near-Instantaneously Adaptive QAM
A comprehensive overview of adaptive transceivers was provided in [169] and this section is
also based on [169]. As we noted in the previous chapters, mobile communications channels
typically exhibit a near-instantaneously fluctuating time-variant channel quality
and hence conventional fixed-mode modems suffer from bursts of transmission errors, even
if the system was designed for providing a high link margin. An efficient approach to mitigat
ing these detrimental effects is to adaptively adjust the modulation and/or the channel coding
format as well as a range of other system parameters based on the near-instantaneous chan
nel quality information perceived by the receiver, which is fed back to the transmitter with the
aid of a feedback channel [173]. This plausible principle was recognised by Hayes [173] as
early as
It was also shown in the previous sections that these near-instantaneously adaptive
schemes require a reliable feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. However, the
channel quality variations have to be sufficiently slow for the transmitter to be able to adapt its
modulation and/or channel coding format appropriately. The performance of these schemes
can potentially be enhanced with the aid of channel quality prediction techniques [174]. As
an efficient fading counter-measure, Hayes [173] proposed the employment of transmission
power adaptation, while Cavers [175] suggested invoking a variable symbol duration scheme
in response to the perceived channel quality at the expense of a variable bandwidth require
ment. A disadvantage of the variable-power scheme is that it increases both the average
transmitted power requirements and the level of co-channel interference imposed on other
users, while requiring a high-linearity class-A or AB power amplifier, which exhibit a low
power-efficiency. As a more attractive alternative, the employment of AQAM was proposed
by Steele and Webb, which circumvented some of the above-mentioned disadvantages by
employing various star-QAM constellations [122,
With the advent of Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation (PSAM) [138, 139, 177], Otsuki et
al. [178] employed square-shaped AQAM constellations instead of star constellations
as a practical fading counter measure. With the aid of analysing the channel capacity of
Rayleigh fading channels [180], Goldsmith et al. [181] and Alouini et al. [182] showed
that combined variable-power, variable-rate adaptive schemes are attractive in terms of ap
proaching the capacity of the channel and characterised the achievable throughput perfor
mance of variable-power AQAM [181]. However, they also found that the extra through
put achieved by the additional variable-power assisted adaptation over the constantpower
variable-rate scheme is marginal for most types of fading channels [181,
In 1996 Torrance and Hanzo [184] proposed a set of mode switching levels s designed for
achieving a high average BPS throughput, while maintaining the target average BER. Their
method was based on defining a specific combined BPS/BER cost-function for transmission
over narrowband Rayleigh channels, which incorporated both the BPS throughput as well as
20 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
the target average BER of the system. Powell’s optimisation was invoked for finding a set
of mode switching thresholds, which were constant, regardless of the actual channel Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) encountered, i.e. irrespective of the prevalent instantaneous channel
conditions. However, in 2001 Choi and Hanzo [185] noted that a higher BPS throughput can
be achieved, if under high channel SNR conditions the activation of high-throughput AQAM
modes is further encouraged by lowering the AQAM mode switching thresholds. More explic
itly, a set of SNR-dependent AQAM mode switching levels was proposed [185], which keeps
the average BER constant, while maximising the achievable throughput. We note furthermore
that the set of switching levels derived in [184, 186] is based on Powell’s multidimensional
optimisation technique [187] and hence the optimisation process may become trapped in a lo
cal minimum. This problem was overcome by Choi and Hanzo upon deriving an optimum set
of switching levels [185], when employing the Lagrangian multiplier technique. It was shown
that this set of switching levels results in the global optimum in a sense that the corresponding
AQAM scheme obtains the maximum possible average BPS throughput, while maintaining
the target average BER. An important further development was Tang’s contribution [188] in
the area of contriving an intelligent learning scheme for the appropriate adjustment of the
AQAM switching thresholds
These contributions demonstrated that AQAM exhibited promising advantages, when
compared to fixed modulation schemes in terms of spectral efficiency, BER performance
and robustness against channel delay spread, etc. Various systems employing AQAM were
also characterised in [179]. The numerical upper bound performance of narrow-band BbB
AQAM over slow Rayleigh flat-fading channels was evaluated by Torrance and Hanzo
while over wide-band channels by Wong and Hanzo [190, 191]. Following these develop
ments, adaptive modulation was also studied in conjunction with channel coding and power
control techniques by Matsuoka et al. [192] as well as Goldsmith and Chua [193,
In the early phase of research more emphasis was dedicated to the system aspects of
adaptive modulation in a narrow-band environment. A reliable method of transmitting the
modulation control parameters was proposed by Otsuki et al. [178], where the parameters
were embedded in the transmission frame’s mid-amble using Walsh codes. Subsequently, at
the receiver the Walsh sequences were decoded using maximum likelihood detection. An
other technique of signalling the required modulation mode used was proposed by Torrance
and Hanzo [195], where the modulation control symbols were represented by unequal error
protection 5-PSK symbols. Symbol-by-Symbol (SbS) adaptive, rather than BbBadaptive
systems were proposed by Lau and Maric in [196], where the transmitter is capable of trans
mitting each symbol in a different modem mode, depending on the channel conditions. Natu
rally, the receiver has to synchronise with the transmitter in terms of the SbS-adapted mode
sequence, in order to correctly demodulate the received symbols and hence the employment
of BbB-adaptivity is less challenging, while attaining a similar performance to that of BbB
adaptive arrangements under typical channel conditions
The adaptive modulation philosophy was then extended to wideband multi-path environ
ments amongst others for example by Kamio et al. [197] by utilizing a bi-directional Decision
Feedback Equaliser (DFE) in a micro- and macro-cellular environment. This equalization
technique employed both forward and backward oriented channel estimation based on the
pre-amble and post-amble symbols in the transmitted frame. Equalizer tap gain interpolation
across the transmitted frame was also utilized for reducing the complexity in conjunction
with space diversity [197]. The authors concluded that the cell radius could be enlarged in
1.3. HISTORY OF NEAR-INSTANTANEOUSLY ADAPTIVE QAM
a macro-cellular system and a higher area-spectral efficiency could be attained for micro
cellular environments by utilizing adaptive modulation. The data transmission latency ef
fect, which occurred when the input data rate was higher than the instantaneous transmission
throughput was studied and solutions were formulated using frequency hopping [198] and
statistical multiplexing, where the number of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) times
lots allocated to a user was adaptively controlled
In reference [200] symbol rate adaptive modulation was applied, where the symbol rate or
the number of modulation levels was adapted by using 18 -rate QAM

4 -rate QAM

2 rate
16QAM as well as full-rate 16QAM and the criterion used for adapting the modem modes
was based on the instantaneous received signal to noise ratio and channel delay spread. The
slowly varying channel quality of the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) was rendered similar
by utilizing short frame duration Time Division Duplex (TDD) and the maximum normalised
delay spread simulated was 0.1. A variable channel coding rate was then introduced by Mat
suoka et al. in conjunction with adaptive modulation in reference [192], where the transmitted
burst incorporated an outer Reed Solomon code and an inner convolutional code in order to
achieve high-quality data transmission. The coding rate was varied according to the preva
lent channel quality using the same method, as in adaptive modulation in order to achieve a
certain target BER performance. A so-called channel margin was introduced in this contri
bution, which effectively increased the switching thresholds for the sake of preempting the
effects of channel quality estimation errors, although this inevitably reduced the achievable
BPS throughput
In an effort to improve the achievable performance versus complexity trade-off in the
context of AQAM, Yee and Hanzo [201] studied the design of various Radial Basis Func
tion (RBF) assisted neural network based schemes, while communicating over dispersive
channels. The advantage of these RBF-aided DFEs is that they are capable of delivering
error-free decisions even in scenarios, when the received phasors cannot be error-freely de
tected by the conventional DFE, since they cannot be separated into decision classes with
the aid of a linear decision boundary. In these so-called linearly non-separable decision sce
narios the RBF-assisted DFE still may remain capable of classifying the received phasors
into decision classes without decision errors. A further improved turbo BCH-coded version
of this RBF-aided system was characterised by Yee et al. in [202], while a turboequalised
RBF arrangement was the subject of the investigation conducted by Yee, Liew and Hanzo
in [203, 204]. The RBF-aided AQAM research has also been extended to the turbo equali
sation of a convolutional as well as space-time trellis coded arrangement proposed by Yee
Yeap and Hanzo [169,205,206]. The same authors then endeavoured to reduce the associated
implementation complexity of an RBF-aided QAM modem with the advent of employing a
separate in-phase / quadrature-phase turbo equalisation scheme in the quadrature arms of the
modem
As already mentioned above, the performance of channel coding in conjunction with
adaptive modulation in a narrow-band environment was also characterised by Chua and
Goldsmith [193]. In their contribution trellis and lattice codes were used without channel
interleaving, invoking a feedback path between the transmitter and receiver for modem mode
control purposes. Specifically, the simulation and theoretical results by Goldsmith and Chua
showed that a 3dB coding gain was achievable at a BER of 10−6 for a 4-sate trellis code
and 4dB by an 8-state trellis code in the context of the adaptive scheme over Rayleighfading
channels, while a 128-state code performed within 5dB of the Shannonian capacity limit
22 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
The effects of the delay in the AQAM mode signalling feedback path on the adaptive mo
dem’s performance were studied and this scheme exhibited a higher spectral efficiency, when
compared to the non-adaptive trellis coded performance. Goeckel [207] also contributed in
the area of adaptive coding and employed realistic outdated, rather than perfect fading esti
mates. Further research on adaptive multidimensional coded modulation was also conducted
by Hole et al. [208] for transmissions over flat fading channels. Pearce, Burr and Tozer
as well as Lau and Mcleod [210] have also analysed the performance trade-offs associated
with employing channel coding and adaptive modulation or adaptive trellis coding, respec
tively, as efficient fading counter measures. In an effort to provide a fair comparison of the
various coded modulation schemes known at the time of writing, Ng, Wong and Hanzo have
also studied Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM), Turbo TCM (TTCM), Bit-Interleaved Coded
Modulation (BICM) and Iterative-Decoding assisted BICM (BICM-ID), where TTCM was
found to be the best scheme at a given decoding complexity
Subsequent contributions by Suzuki et al. [212] incorporated space-diversity and power
adaptation in conjunction with adaptive modulation, for example in order to combat the ef
fects of the multi-path channel environment at a 10Mbits/s transmission rate. The maximum
tolerable delay-spread was deemed to be one symbol duration for a target mean BER perfor
mance of 0.1%. This was achieved in a TDMA scenario, where the channel estimates were
predicted based on the extrapolation of previous channel quality estimates. As mentioned
above, variable transmitted power was applied in combination with adaptive modulation in
reference [194], where the transmission rate and power adaptation was optimised for the sake
of achieving an increased spectral efficiency. In their treatise a slowly varying channel was
assumed and the instantaneous received power required for achieving a certain upper bound
performance was assumed to be known prior to transmission. Power control in conjunction
with a pre-distortion type non-linear power amplifier compensator was studied in the context
of adaptive modulation in reference [213]. This method was used to mitigate the nonlinearity
effects associated with the power amplifier, when QAM modulators were used
Results were also recorded concerning the performance of adaptive modulation in con
junction with different multiple access schemes in a narrow-band channel environment. In a
TDMA system, dynamic channel assignment was employed by Ikeda et al., where in addition
to assigning a different modulation mode to a different channel quality, priority was always
given to those users in their request for reserving time-slots, which benefitted from the best
channel quality [214]. The performance was compared to fixed channel assignment systems
where substantial gains were achieved in terms of system capacity. Furthermore, a lower
call termination probability was recorded. However, the probability of intra-cell handoff
increased as a result of the associated dynamic channel assignment (DCA) scheme, which
constantly searched for a high-quality, high-throughput time-slot for supporting the actively
communicating users. The application of adaptive modulation in packet transmission was
introduced by Ue, Sampei and Morinaga [215], where the results showed an improved BPS
throughput. The performance of adaptive modulation was also characterised in conjunction
with an automatic repeat request (ARQ) system in reference [216], where the transmitted
bits were encoded using a cyclic redundant code (CRC) and a convolutional punctured code
in order to increase the data throughput
A further treatise was published by Sampei, Morinaga and Hamaguchi [217] on labora
tory test results concerning the utilization of adaptive modulation in a TDD scenario, where
the modem mode switching criterion was based on the signal to noise ratio and on the nor
1.4. HISTORY OF OFDM-BASED QAM
malised delay-spread. In these experimental results, the channel quality estimation errors
degraded the performance and consequently - as laready alluded to earlier - a channel esti
mation error margin was introduced for mitigating this degradation. Explicitly, the channel
estimation error margin was defined as the measure of how much extra protection margin
must be added to the switching threshold levels for the sake of minimising the effects of the
channel estimation errors. The delay-spread also degraded the achievable performance due
to the associated irreducible BER, which was not compensated by the receiver. However
the performance of the adaptive scheme in a delay-spread impaired channel environment was
better, than that of a fixed modulation scheme. These experiments also concluded that the
AQAM scheme can be operated for a Doppler frequency of fd = 10Hz at a normalised delay
spread of 0.1 or for fd = 14Hz at a normalised delay spread of 0.02, which produced a mean
BER of 0.1% at a transmission rate of 1 Mbitss
Lastly, the data buffering-induced latency and co-channel interference aspects of AQAM
modems were investigated in [218, 219]. Specifically, the latency associated with storing the
information to be transmitted during severely degraded channel conditions was mitigated by
frequency hopping or statistical multiplexing. As expected, the latency is increased, when
either the mobile speed or the channel SNR are reduced, since both of these result in pro
longed low instantaneous SNR intervals. It was demonstrated that as a result of the proposed
measures, typically more than 4dB SNR reduction was achieved by the proposed adaptive
modems in comparison to the conventional fixed-mode benchmark modems employed. How
ever, the achievable gains depend strongly on the prevalant co-channel interference levels and
hence interference cancellation was invoked in [219] on the basis of adjusting the demodula
tion decision boundaries after estimating the interfering channel’s magnitude and phase
The associated AQAM principles may also be invoked in the context of multicarrier
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) modems [179]. This principle was first
proposed by Kalet [154] for employment in OFDM systems and was then further developed
for example by Czylwik et al. [220] as well as by Chow, Cioffi and Bingham [221]. The
associated concepts were detailed for example in [179] and they will also be augmented in
Part III of this monograph. Let us now briefly review the recent history of OFDMbased
QAM systems in the next section
1.4 History of OFDM-based QAM
1.4.1 History of OFDM
The first QAM-related so-called orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme
was proposed by Chang in 1966 [142] for dispersive fading channels, which has also un
dergone a dramatic evolution due to the efforts of Weinstein, Peled, Ruiz, Hirosaki, Kolb
Cimini, Schüssler, Preuss, Rückriem, Kalet et al. [142–155]. OFDM was standardised as the
European digital audio broadcast (DAB) as well as digital video broadcast (DVB) scheme
It constituted also a credible proposal for the recent third-generation mobile radio standard
competition in Europe. It was recently selected as the high performance local area network
(HIPERLAN) transmission technique
The system’s operational principle is that the original bandwidth is divided in a high
number of narrow sub-bands, in which the mobile channel can be considered nondispersive
Hence no channel equaliser is required and instead of implementing a bank of subchannel

modems they can be conveniently implemented by the help of a single fast fourier Trans
former (FFT). This scheme will be the topic of Chapters 15 -
These OFDM systems - often also termed as frequency division multiplexing FDM
or multi-tone systems - have been employed in military applications since the 1960s, for
example by Bello [222], Zimmerman [143], Powers and Zimmerman [223], Chang and
Gibby [224] and others. Saltzberg [225] studied a multi-carrier system employing orthog
onal time–staggered quadrature amplitude modulation (O-QAM) of the carriers
The employment of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to replace the banks of sinu
soidal generators and the demodulators was suggested by Weinstein and Ebert [144] in
which significantly reduces the implementation complexity of OFDM modems. In
Hirosaki [155] suggested an equalisation algorithm in order to suppress both intersymbol
and intersubcarrier interference caused by the channel impulse response or timing and fre
quency errors. Simplified OFDM modem implementations were studied by Peled [148] in
1980, while Hirosaki [149] introduced the DFT based implementation of Saltzberg’s OQAM
OFDM system. From Erlangen University, Kolb [150], Schüßler [151], Preuss [152] and
Rückriem [153] conducted further research into the application of OFDM. Cimini [145] and
Kalet [154] published analytical and early seminal experimental results on the performance
of OFDM modems in mobile communications channels
More recent advances in OFDM transmission were presented in the impressive stateof
the-art collection of works edited by Fazel and Fettweis [226], including the research by
Fettweis et al. at Dresden University, Rohling et al. at Braunschweig University, Vandendorp
at Loeven University, Huber et al. at Erlangen University, Lindner et al. at Ulm University
Kammeyer et al. at Brehmen University and Meyr et al. [227,228] at Aachen University, but
the individual contributions are too numerous to mention
While OFDM transmission over mobile communications channels can alleviate the prob
lem of multipath propagation, recent research efforts have focused on solving a set of inherent
difficulties regarding OFDM, namely the peak–to–mean power ratio, time and frequency syn
chronisation, and on mitigating the effects of the frequency selective fading channel. These
issues are addressed below in slightly more depth, while a treatment is given in Chapters
-
1.4.2 Peak-to-Mean Power Ratio
The peak-to-mean power ratio problem of OFDM systems has been detailed along with a
range of mitigating techniques in [172]. It is plausible that the OFDM signal - which is
the superposition of a high number of modulated sub-channel signals - may exhibit a high
instantaneous signal peak with respect to the average signal level. Furthermore, large sig
nal amplitude swings are encountered, when the time domain signal traverses from a low
instantaneous power waveform to a high power waveform, which may results in a high out
of-band (OOB) harmonic distortion power, unless the transmitter’s power amplifier exhibits
an extremely high linearity across the entire signal level range (Section 4.5.1). This then
potentially contaminates the adjacent channels with adjacent channel interference. Practical
amplifiers exhibit a finite amplitude range, in which they can be considered almost linear. In
order to prevent severe clipping of the high OFDM signal peaks - which is the main source
of OOB emissions - the power amplifier must not be driven into saturation and hence they
are typically operated with a certain so-called back-off, creating a certain ”head room” for
1.4. HISTORY OF OFDM-BASED QAM
the signal peaks, which reduces the risk of amplifier saturation and OOB emmission. Two
different families of solutions have been suggested in the literature, in order to mitigate these
problems, either reducing the peak-to-mean power ratio, or improving the amplification stage
of the transmitter
More explicitly, Shepherd [229], Jones [230], and Wulich [231] suggested different cod
ing techniques which aim to minimise the peak power of the OFDM signal by employing
different data encoding schemes before modulation, with the philosophy of choosing block
codes whose legitimate code words exhibit low so-called Crest factors or peak-to-mean power
envelope fluctuation. Müller [232], Pauli [233], May [234] and Wulich [235] suggested
different algorithms for post-processing the time domain OFDM signal prior to amplifica
tion, while Schmidt and Kammeyer [236] employed adaptive subcarrier allocation in order
to reduce the crest factor. Dinis and Gusmão [237–239] researched the use of twobranch
amplifiers, while the clustered OFDM technique introduced by Daneshrad, Cimini and Car
loni [240] operates with a set of parallel partial FFT processors with associated transmitting
chains. OFDM systems with increased robustness to non-linear distortion have been proposed
by Okada, Nishijima and Komaki [241] as well as by Dinis and Gusmão
1.4.3 Synchronisation
Time and frequency synchronisation between the transmitter and receiver are of crucial im
portance as regards to the performance of an OFDM link [243, 244]. A wide variety of tech
niques have been proposed for estimating and correcting both timing and carrier frequency
offsets at the OFDM receiver. Rough timing and frequency acquisition algorithms relying
on known pilot symbols or pilot tones embedded into the OFDM symbols have been sug
gested by Claßen [227], Warner [245], Sari [246], Moose [247], as well as Brüninghaus and
Rohling [248]. Fine frequency and timing tracking algorithms exploiting the OFDM signals
cyclic extension were published by Moose [247], Daffara [249] and Sandell
1.4.4 OFDMCDMA
Combining OFDM transmissions with code division multiple access (CDMA) [171] allows
us to exploit the wideband channel’s inherent frequency diversity by spreading each sym
bol across multiple subcarriers. This technique has been pioneered by Yee, Linnartz and
Fettweis [251], by Chouly, Brajal and Jourdan [252], as well as by Fettweis, Bahai and An
vari [253]. Fazel and Papke [254] investigated convolutional coding in conjunction with
OFDM/CDMA. Prasad and Hara [255] compared various methods of combining the two
techniques, identifying three different structures, namely multi-carrier CDMA MCCDMA
multi-carrier direct sequence CDMA (MC-DS-CDMA) and multi-tone CDMA MTCDMA
Like non-spread OFDM transmission, OFDM/CDMA methods suffer from high peakto
mean power ratios, which are dependent on the frequency domain spreading scheme, as in
vestigated by Choi, Kuan and Hanzo
1.4.5 Adaptive Antennas in OFDM Systems
The employment of adaptive antenna techniques in conjunction with OFDM transmissions
was shown to be advantageous in suppressing co-channel interference in cellular commu

nications systems. Li, Cimini and Sollenberger [257–259], Kim, Choi and Cho [260], Lin
Cimini and Chuang [261] as well as Münster et al. [262] have investigated algorithms for
multi-user channel estimation and interference suppression. To elaborate a little further, mul
tiple antenna assisted wireless communications systems are discussed in [172] in detail, when
incorporated in OFDM systems for the sake of increasing the number of users supported
Furthermore, multiple antenna aided space-time coding arrangements constitute the topic
of [170], where the main objective is the mitigation of the channel-induced fading, since
space-time codecs are capable of achieving substantial transmit diversity gains. A range of
space-time spreading aided CDMA schemes, which were designed with a similar objective to
space-time codecs, were characterised in [171]. Finally, multiple antenna based beamformers
are discussed in [263], where the basic design objective is to achieve angular selectivity and
hence mitigate the effects of co-channel interference
1.4.6 Decision-Directed Channel Estimation for OFDM
1.4.6.1 Decision-Directed Channel Estimation for Single-User OFDM
In recent years numerous research contributions have appeared on the topic of channel trans
fer function estimation techniques designed for employment in single-user, single transmit
antenna-assisted OFDM scenarios, since the availability of an accurate channel transfer func
tion estimate is one of the prerequisites for coherent symbol detection with an OFDM re
ceiver. The techniques proposed in the literature can be classified as pilot-assisted, decision
directed (DD) and blind channel estimation (CE) methods
In the context of pilot-assisted channel transfer function estimation a subset of the avail
able subcarriers is dedicated to the transmission of specific pilot symbols known to the re
ceiver, which are used for ”sampling” the desired channel transfer function. Based on these
samples of the frequency domain transfer function, the well-known process of interpolation
is used for generating a transfer function estimate for each subcarrier residing between the
pilots. This is achieved at the cost of a reduction in the number of useful subcarriers available
for data transmission. The family of pilot-assisted channel estimation techniques was investi
gated for example by Chang and Su [288], Höher [264,272,273], Itami et al. [277], Li
Tufvesson and Maseng [271], Wang and Liu [283], as well as Yang et al. [279, 284,
By contrast, in the context of Decision-Directed Channel Estimation (DDCE) all the
sliced and remodulated subcarrier data symbols are considered as pilots. In the absence
of symbol errors and also depending on the rate of channel fluctuation, it was found that
accurate channel transfer function estimates can be obtained, which often are of better qual
ity, in terms of the channel transfer function estimator’s mean-square error (MSE), than the
estimates offered by pilot-assisted schemes. This is because the latter arrangements usually
invoke relatively sparse pilot patterns
The family of decision-directed channel estimation techniques was investigated for exam
ple by van de Beek et al. [267], Edfors et al. [268,275], Li et al. [274], Li [286], Mignone and
Morello [270], Al-Susa and Ormondroyd [278], Frenger and Svensson [269], as well as Wil
son et al. [266]. Furthermore, the family of blind channnel estimation techniques was studied
by Lu and Wang [285], Necker and Stüber [289], as well as by Zhou and Giannakis
The various contributions have been summarized in Tables 1.1 and

1.4. HISTORY OF OFDM-BASED QAM
sociated with a relatively high rate of channel variation expressed in terms of the OFDM
symbol normalized Doppler frequency, linear prediction techniques well known from the
speech coding literature [168, 291] can be invoked. To elaborate a little further, we will
substitute the CIR-related tap estimation filter - which is part of the two-dimensional chan
nel transfer function estimator proposed in [274] - by a CIR-related tap prediction filter
The employment of this CIR-related tap prediction filter enables a more accurate estimation
of the channel transfer function encountered during the forthcoming transmission time slot
and thus potentially enhances the performance of the channel estimator. We will be follow
ing the general concepts described by Duel-Hallen et al. [292] and the ideas presented by
Frenger and Svensson [269], where frequency domain prediction filter-assisted DDCE was
proposed. Furthermore, we should mention the contributions of Tufvesson et al. [276,
where a prediction filter-assisted frequency domain pre-equalisation scheme was discussed
in the context of OFDM. In a further contribution by Al-Susa and Ormondroyd [278], adap
tive prediction filter-assisted DDCE designed for OFDM has been proposed upon invoking
techniques known from speech coding, such as the Levinson-Durbin algorithm or the Burg
algorithm [291, 294, 295] in order to determine the predictor coefficients
1.4.6.2 Decision-Directed Channel Estimation for Multi-User OFDM
In contrast to the above-mentioned single-user OFDM scenarios, in a multi-user OFDM sce
nario the signal received by each antenna is constituted by the superposition of the signal
contributions associated with the different users or transmit antennas. Note that in terms
of the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) structure of the channel the multi-user single
transmit antenna scenario is equivalent, for example, to a single-user space-time coded STC
scenario using multiple transmit antennas. For the latter a Least-Squares (LS) error channel
estimator was proposed by Li et al. [296], which aims at recovering the different transmit
antennas’ channel transfer functions on the basis of the output signal of a specific reception
antenna element and by also capitalising on the remodulated received symbols associated
with the different users. The performance of this estimator was found to be limited in terms
of the mean-square estimation error in scenarios, where the product of the number of trans
mit antennas and the number of CIR taps to be estimated per transmit antenna approaches the
total number of subcarriers hosted by an OFDM symbol. As a design alternative, in [297] a
DDCE was proposed by Jeon et al. for a space-time coded OFDM scenario of two transmit
antennas and two receive antennas
Specifically, the channel transfer function1 associated with each transmit-receive antenna
pair was estimated on the basis of the output signal of the specific receive antenna upon
subtracting the interfering signal contributions associated with the remaining transmit anten
nas. These interference contributions were estimated by capitalising on the knowledge of the
channel transfer functions of all interfering transmit antennas predicted during the (n− th
OFDM symbol period for the n-th OFDM symbol, also invoking the corresponding remod
ulated symbols associated with the n-th OFDM symbol. To elaborate further, the difference
between the subtraction-based channel transfer function estimator of [297] and the LS es
timator proposed by Li et al. in [296] is that in the former the channel transfer functions
predicted during the previous, i.e. the (n − 1)-th OFDM symbol period for the current, ie

the n-th OFDM symbol are employed for both symbol detection as well as for obtaining an
updated channel estimate for employment during the (n + 1)-th OFDM symbol period. In
the approach advocated in [297] the subtraction of the different transmit antennas’ interfering
signals is performed in the frequency domain
By contrast, in [298] a similar technique was proposed by Li with the aim of simplify
ing the DDCE approach of [296], which operates in the time domain. A prerequisite for the
operation of this parallel interference cancellation (PIC)-assisted DDCE is the availability of
a reliable estimate of the various channel transfer functions for the current OFDM symbol
which are employed in the cancellation process in order to obtain updated channel transfer
function estimates for the demodulation of the next OFDM symbol. In order to compen
sate for the channel’s variation as a function of the OFDM symbol index, linear prediction
techniques can be employed, as it was also proposed for example in [298]. However, due to
the estimator’s recursive structure, determining the optimum predictor coefficients is not as
straightforward as for the transversal FIR filter-assisted predictor
An overview of further publications on channel transfer factor estimation for OFDM sys
tems supported by multiple antennas is provided in Table 1.3, although these topics are be
yond the scope of this book. Various multiple antenna aided wireless communications sys
tems are discussed in [172] in detail, when incorporated in OFDM systems. Furthermore

space-time spreading is addressed in [171]. Finally, multiple antenna based beamformers are

1.4.7 Uplink Detection Techniques for Multi-User SDMAOFDM
The related family of Space-Division-Multiple-Access (SDMA) communication systems has
recently drawn wide reseach interests. In these systems the L different users’ transmitted
signals are separated at the base-station (BS) with the aid of their unique, user-specific spatial
signature, which is constituted by the P -element vector of channel transfer factors between
the users’ single transmit antenna and the P different receiver antenna elements at the BS
upon assuming flat-fading channel conditions such as those often experienced in the context
of each of the OFDM subcarriers
A whole host of multi-user detection (MUD) techniques known from CodeDivision
Multiple-Access (CDMA) communications lend themselves also to an application in the
context of SDMA-OFDM on a per-subcarrier basis. Some of these techniques are the Least
Squares (LS) [318, 324, 332, 334], Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) [310–313,
318, 322, 326, 334–336], Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) [309, 314, 318, 322,
329, 331, 333, 334, 336], Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) [330, 334] and Maximum
Likelihood (ML) detection [317,319–323,325,328,334,336]. A comprehensive overview of
recent publications on MUD techniques for MIMO systems is given in Tables 1.4 and
1.4.8 OFDM Applications
Due to their implementational complexity, OFDM applications have been scarce until quite
recently. Recently, however, OFDM has been adopted as the new European digital audio
broadcasting (DAB) standard [146, 147, 337–339] as well as for the terrestrial digital video
broadcasting (DVB) system [246, 340]. During this process the design of OFDM systems

has matured and their wide-range employment has become a cost-efficient commercial real
ity. In recent years OFDM schemes have found their way into wireless local area networks
(WLANs) as well, such as the 802.11 family
For fixed-wire applications, OFDM is employed in the asynchronous digital subscriber
line (ADSL) and high-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL) systems [341–344] and it has
also been suggested for power line communications systems [345, 346] due to its resilience
to time dispersive channels and narrow band interferers
OFDM applications were studied also within the various European Research projects
The MEDIAN project investigated a 155 Mbps wireless asynchronous transfer mode
(WATM) network [348–351], while the Magic WAND group [352,353] developed an OFDM
based WLAN. Hallmann and Rohling [354] presented a range of different OFDM systems
that were applicable to the European Telecommunications Standardisation Institute’s ETSI
recent personal communications oriented air interface concept
1.5 History of QAM-Based Coded Modulation
The history of channel coding or Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding dates back to Shan
non’s pioneering work [356] in 1948, in which he showed that it is possible to design a
communication system with any desired small probability of error, whenever the rate of trans
mission is smaller than the capacity of the channel. While Shannon outlined the theory that
explained the fundamental limits imposed on the efficiency of communications systems, he
provided no insights into how to actually approach these limits. This motivated the search for
codes that would produce arbitrarily small probability of error. Specifically, Hamming
and Golay [358] were the first to develop practical error control schemes. Convolutional
codes [359] were later introduced by Elias in 1955, while Viterbi [360] invented a maxi
mum likelihood sequence estimation algorithm in 1967 for efficiently decoding convolutional
codes. In 1974, Bahl proposed the more complex Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) algorithm
which is capable of achieving the minimum achievable BER
The first successful application of channel coding was the employment of convolutional
codes [359] in deep-space probes in the 1970s. However, for years to come, error con
trol coding was considered to have limited applicability, apart from deep-space communica
tions. Specifically, this is a power-limited scenario, which has no strict bandwidth limitation
By contrast mobile communications systems constitute a power- and bandwidth-limited sce
nario. In 1987, a bandwidth efficient Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) [361] scheme em
ploying symbol-based channel interleaving in conjunction with Set-Partitioning (SP)
assisted signal labelling was proposed by Ungerböck. Specifically, the TCM scheme, which
is based on combining convolutional codes with multidimensional signal sets, constitutes a
bandwidth efficient scheme that has been widely recognised as an efficient error control tech
nique suitable for applications in mobile communications [363]. Another powerful coded
modulation scheme utilising bit-based channel interleaving in conjunction with Gray signal
labelling, which is referred to as Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM), was proposed
by Zehavi [364] as well as by Caire, Taricco and Biglieri [365]. Another breakthrough in
the history of error control coding is the invention of turbo codes by Berrou, Glavieux and
Thitimajshima [366] in 1993. Convolutional codes were used as the component codes and
decoders based on the MAP algorithm were employed. The results proved that a performance
1.6. QAM IN MULTIPLE ANTENNA BASED SYSTEMS
close to the Shannon limit can be achieved in practice with the aid of binary codes. The at
tractive properties of turbo codes have attracted intensive research in this area
As a result, turbo coding has reached a state of maturity within just a few years and was
standardised in the recently ratified third-generation (3G) mobile radio systems
However, turbo codes often have a low coding rate and hence require considerable band
width expansion. Therefore, one of the objectives of turbo coding research is the design of
bandwidth-efficient turbo codes. In order to equip the family of binary turbo codes with a
higher spectral efficiency, BICM-based Turbo Coded Modulation (TuCM) [371] was pro
posed in 1994. Specifically, TuCM uses a binary turbo encoder, which is linked to a signal
mapper, after its output bits were suitably punctured and multiplexed for the sake of trans
mitting the desired number of information bits per transmitted symbol. In the TuCM scheme
of [371] Gray-coding based signal labelling was utilised. For example, two 1/2-rate Recursive
Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes are used for generating a total of four turbo coded bits
and this bit stream may be punctured for generating three bits, which are mapped to an PSK
modulation scheme. By contrast, in separate coding and modulation scheme, any modulation
schemes for example BPSK, may be used for transmitting the channel coded bits. Finally
without puncturing, 16QAM transmission would have to be used for maintaining the original
transmission bandwidth. Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation (TTCM) [372] is a more recently
proposed channel coding scheme that has a structure similar to that of the family of turbo
codes, but employs TCM schemes as its component codes. The TTCM symbols are transmit
ted alternatively from the first and the second constituent TCM encoders and symbolbased
interleavers are utilised for turbo interleaving and channel interleaving. It was shown in
that TTCM performs better than the TCM and TuCM schemes at a comparable complexity
In 1998, iterative joint decoding and demodulation assisted BICM referred to as BICMID
was proposed in [373, 374], which uses SP based signal labelling. The aim of BICM-ID is
to increase the Euclidean distance of BICM and hence to exploit the full advantage of bit in
terleaving with the aid of soft-decision feedback based iterative decoding [374]. Many other
bandwidth efficient schemes using turbo codes have been proposed in the literature [368], but
we will focus our study on TCM, BICM, TTCM and BICM-ID schemes in the context of
wireless channels in this part of the book
1.6 QAM in Multiple Antenna Based Systems
In recent years various smart antenna designs have emerged, which have found application
in diverse scenarios, as seen in Table 1.6. The main objective of employing smart antennas
is that of combating the effects of multipath fading on the desired signal and suppressing
interfering signals, thereby increasing both the performance and capacity of wireless sys
tems [375]. Specifically, in smart antenna assisted systems multiple antennas may be invoked
at the transmitter and/or the receiver, where the antennas may be arranged for achieving spa
tial diversity, directional beamforming or for attaining both diversity and beamforming. In
smart antenna systems the achievable performance improvements are usually a function of
the antenna spacing and that of the algorithms invoked for processing the signals received by
the antenna elements
In beamforming arrangements [263] typically λ/2-spaced antenna elements are used
for the sake of creating a spatially selective transmitter/receiver beam. Smart antennas using

MIMO systems also employ multiple antennas, but in contrast
to SDMA arrangements, not for the sake of supporting multiple

beamforming have widely been employed for mitigating the effects of various interfering
signals and for providing beamforming gain. Furthermore, the beamforming arrangement is
capable of suppressing co-channel interference, which allows the system to support multiple
users within the same bandwidth and/or same time-slot by separating them spatially. This
spatial separation becomes however only feasible, if the corresponding users are separable
in terms of the angle of arrival of their beams. These beamforming schemes, which employ
appropriately phased antenna array elements that are spaced at distances of λ/2 typically
result in an improved SINR distribution and enhanced network capacity
In contrast to the λ/2-spaced phased array elements, in spatial diversity schemes, such
as space-time coding [170] aided transmit diversity arangements, the multiple antennas are
positioned as far apart as possible. A typical antenna element spacing of 10λ [375] may be
used, so that the transmitted signals of the different antennas experience independent fading
when they reach the receiver. This is because the maximum diversity gain can be achieved
when the received signal replicas experience independent fading. Although spatial diversity
can be achieved by employing multiple antennas at either the base station, mobile station, or
both, it is more cost effective and practical to employ multiple transmit antennas at the base
station. A system having multiple receiver antennas has the potential of achieving receiver di
versity, while that employing multiple transmit antennas exhibits transmit diversity. Recently
the family of transmit diversity schemes based on space-time coding, either space-time block
codes or space-time trellis codes, has received wide attention and has been invoked in the
3rd-generation systems [263,376]. The aim of using spatial diversity is to provide both trans

mit as well as receive diversity and hence enhance the system’s integrity/robustness. This
typically results in a better physical-layer performance and hence a better network-layer per
formance, hence space-time codes indirectly increase not only the transmission integrity, but
also the achievable spectral efficiency
A third application of smart antennas is often referred to as Space Division Multiple
Access (SDMA), which exploits the unique, user-specific ”spatial signature” of the individual
users for differentiating amongst them. In simple conceptual terms one could argue that both
a conventional CDMA spreading code and the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) affect the
transmitted signal similarly - they are namely convolved with it. Hence, provided that the
CIR is accurately estimated, it becomes known and certainly unique, although - as opposed
to orthogonal Walsh-Hadamad spreading codes, for example - not orthogonal to the other
CIRs. Nonetheless, it may be used for uniquely identifying users after channel estimation
and hence for supporting several users within the same bandwidth. Provided that a powerful
multiuser detector is available, one can support even more users than the number of antennas
Hence this method enhances the achievable spectral efficiency directly
Finally, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems [309, 377–380] also employ
multiple antennas, but in contrast to SDMA arrangements, not for the sake of supporting
multiple users. Instead, they aim for increasing the throughput of a wireless system in terms
of the number of bits per symbol that can be transmitted by a single user in a given bandwidth
at a given integrity
1.7 Outline of the Book
1.7.1 Part I: QAM Basics
• In Chapter 2 we consider the communications channels over which we wish to send
our data. These channels are divided into Gaussian and mobile radio channels, and the
characteristics of each are explained

speech or other source waveforms are converted into a form suitable for transmission
over a channel, and introducing some of the fundamentals of modems

modulator, considering QAM constellations, pulse shaping techniques, methods of
generating and detecting QAM, as well as amplifier techniques to reduce the problems
associated with nonlinearities

aspects of QAM transmission, showing how the BER can be mathematically computed
for transmission over Gaussian channels

applicable mainly to systems operating over benign Gaussian channels, such as the
times-two and the early-late recovery schemes as well as their derivatives
• Chapter 7 continues our discourse by considering channel equalisers. First the family
of classic zero-forcing and least mean square equalisers, as well as Kalman filtering
38 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
based schemes are discussed. Then a large part of this chapter is dedicated to the
portrayal of blind channel equalisers
• Chapter 8 introduces the concept of classic trellis coded modulation schemes and deals
with the historically important family of modems designed for Gaussian channels such
as telephone lines
1.7.2 Part II: Adaptive QAM Techniques for Fading Channels
• Chapter 9 constitutes the first chapter of Part II of the book, focusing on QAMbased
wireless communication by providing a theoretical analysis of QAM transmission over
Rayleigh fading mobile radio channels using the so-called maximum minimum dis
tance square-shaped constellation
• Chapter 10 introduces the concept of differentially encoded QAM, which was de
signed for maintaining a low detection complexity, when communicating over hostile
wireless channels. These schemes are capable of operating without the employment
coherent carrier recovery arrangements, which are prone to false locking in the pres
ence of channel fading. This chapter also considers some of the practicalities of QAM
transmissions over these wireless links, including the effects of intentional constella
tion distortions on the probabilities of the four individual bits of a 4-bit symbol and of
hardware imperfections

mobile radio communications using QAM
• Chapter 22 provides a detailed mathematical characterisation of adaptive QAM sys
tems, which are capable of appropriately adjusting the number of bits per QAM symbol
on the basis of the instantaneous channel conditions. When the instantaneous channel
quality is high, a high number of bits is transmitted. By contrast, under hostile channel
conditions a low number of bits is transmitted for the sake of maintaining the target
integrity. These concepts are also extended to sophisticated space-time coded multi
carrier OFDM and MC-CDMA systems employing multiple transmitters and receivers

1.7. OUTLINE OF THE BOOK
1.7.3 Part III: Advanced QAM
Adaptive OFDM Systems
• In Chapter 15 we focus our attention on the employment of the Fourier transform
in order to show mathematically, how orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) schemes may be implemented at the cost of a low complexity
• In Chapter 16 the BER performance of OFDM modems in AWGN channels is studied
for a set of different modulation schemes in the subcarriers. The effects of amplitude
limiting of the transmitter’s output signal, caused by a simple clipping amplifier model
and of finite resolution D/A and A/D conversion on the system performance are inves
tigated. Oscillator phase noise is considered as a source of intersubcarrier interference
and its effects on the system performance are demonstrated
• In Chapter 17 the effects of time-dispersive frequency-selective Rayleigh fading chan
nels on OFDM transmissions are demonstrated. Channel estimation techniques are
presented which support the employment of coherent detection in frequency selective
channels. Additionally, differential detection is investigated, and the resulting system
performance over the different channels is compared
• Chapter 18 focuses our attention on the time and frequency synchronisation require
ments of OFDM transmissions and the effects of synchronisation errors are demon
strated. Two novel synchronisation algorithms designed for both transmission frame
and OFDM symbol synchronisation are suggested and compared. The resultant system
performance recorded, when communicating over fading wideband channels is exam
ined
• In Chapter 19, based on the results of Chapter 22 and Chapter 17, the employ
ment of adaptive modulation schemes is suggested for duplex point-to-point links over
frequency-selective time-varying channels. Different bit allocation schemes are inves
tigated and a simplified sub-band adaptivity OFDM scheme is suggested for alleviating
the associated signalling constraints. A range of blind modulation scheme detection al
gorithms are also investigated and compared. The employment of longblocklength
convolutional turbo codes is suggested for improving the system’s throughput and the
turbo coded adaptive OFDM modem’s performance is compared using different sets of
parameters. Then the effects of using pre-equalisation at the transmitter are examined
and a set of different pre-equalisation algorithms is introduced. A joint preequalisation
and adaptive modulation algorithm is proposed and its BER and throughput perfor
mance is studied
• In Chapter 20 the adaptive OFDM transmission ideas of Chapter 22 and Chapter
are extended further, in order to include adaptive error correction coding, based on
redundant residual number system (RRNS) and turbo BCH codes. A joint modulation
and code rate adaptation scheme is presented
• Chapter 21 is dedicated to an OFDM-based system design study, which identifies the
benefits and disadvantages of both space-time trellis as well as space-time block codes
versus adaptive modulation under various propagation conditions
40 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.7.4 Part IV: Advanced QAM
Turbo-Equalised Adaptive TCM, TTCM, BICM, BICM-ID and
Space-Time Coding Assisted OFDM, CDMA and MCCDMA
Systems
• In Chapter 24 four different coded modulation schemes, namely TCM, TTCM, BICM
and BICM-ID are introduced. The conceptual differences amongst these four coded
modulation schemes are studied in terms of their coding structure, signal labelling phi
losophy, interleaver type and decoding philosophy. The symbol-based MAP algorithm
operating in the logarithmic domain is also highlighted
• Chapter 25 studies the achievable performance of the above-mentioned coded mod
ulation schemes, when communicating over AWGN and narrowband fading channels
Multi-carrier Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is also combined
with the coded modulation schemes designed for communicating over wideband fad
ing channels. With the aid of multi-carrier OFDM the wideband channel is divided
into numerous narrowband sub-channels, each associated with an individual OFDM
subcarrier. The performance trends of the coded modulation schemes are studied in
the context of these OFDM sub-channels and compared in terms of the associated
decoding complexity, coding delay and effective throughput under the assumption of
encountering non-dispersive channel conditions in each subchannel
• In Chapter 26 the channel equalisation concepts of Chapter 7 are developed further
in the context of AQAM and both a conventional Decision Feedback Equaliser DFE
and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) based DFE are introduced. These schemes are
then combined with various coded modulation schemes communicating over wide
band fading channels. The concepts of conventional DFE based adaptive modulation
as well as RBF-based turbo equalisation and a reduced complexity RBF-based In
phase(I)/Quadrature-phase(Q) turbo equalisation scheme are also presented. We will
incorporate the various coded modulation schemes considered into these systems and
evaluate their performance in terms of the achievable BER, FER and effective through
put, when assuming a similar bandwidth, coding rate and decoding complexity for the
various arrangements
• In Chapter 27 the performance of the various coded modulation schemes is also
evaluated in conjunction with a Direct Sequence (DS) Code-Division Multiple Ac
cess (CDMA) system. Specifically, a DFE based Multi-User Detection (MUD) scheme
is introduced for assisting the fixed-mode coded modulation schemes as well as
the adaptive coded modulation schemes operating in conjunction with DSCDMA
when communicating over wideband fading channels. The concept of Genetic Algo
rithm (GA) based MUD is also highlighted, which is invoked in conjunction with the
coded modulation schemes for employment in the CDMA system. The performance of
this MUD is compared to that of the optimum MUD
• In Chapter 28 IQ-interleaved Coded Modulation (IQ-CM) schemes are introduced for
achieving IQ diversity. Space Time Block Coding (STBC) is also introduced for at
taining additional space/transmit and time diversity. The concept of DoubleSpreading
1.8. SUMMARY
aided Rake Receivers (DoS-RR) is proposed for achieving multipath diversity in a
CDMA downlink, when transmitting over wideband fading channels. Finally, a STBC
based IQ-CM assisted DoS-RR scheme is proposed for attaining transmit-, time-, IQ
and multipath-diversity, in a CDMA downlink, when communicating over wideband
fading channels
• Chapter 29 provides a comparative study of the various coded modulation schemes
studied in Part IV of the book, including suggestions for future research on coded
modulation aided transceivers
Finally, in Chapter 30 a variety of advanced QAM and OFDM assisted turbocoded
DVB schemes are proposed and analysed. Specifically, it compares the performance of
schemes that use blind-equalised QAM modems. It is demonstrated that in comparison
to the standard-based DVB systems the employment of turbo coding can provide an
extra 5-6 dB channel SNR gain and this can be exploited for example to double the
number of transmitted bits in a given bandwidth. This then ultimately allows us to
improve for example the associated video quality that can be guaranteed in a given
bandwidth at the cost of the associated additional implementational complexity
1.8 Summary
Here we conclude our introduction to QAM and the review of publications concerning QAM
as well as its various applications, spanning a period of four decades between the first the
oretical study conducted in the context of Gaussian channels, leading to a whole host of
applications in various sophisticated wireless systems operating in diverse propagation envi
ronments. We now embark on a detailed investigation of the topics introduced in this intro

Adaptive QAM Optimisation for

22.1 Motivation
In Chapter 21 we have considered the design trade-offs of adaptive versus space-time coded
transmissions. Although both methods aim for mitigating the effects of fading-induced chan
nel quality fluctuations, their approach is fundamentally different. Adaptive QAM aims for
adjusting the modulation modes for the sake of maintaining the target integrity, despite the
channel quality fluctuations. By contrast, space-time coding [170] employs multiple trans
mitters and receivers for the sake of directly mitigating the channel quality undulations. It
transpired that both techniques were capable of attaining a similar performance, although
AQAM imposed a lower complexity owing to employing a single transmitter and receiver
In this chapter our discourse evolves further by providing a comparative study of the
various approaches developed for optimising the AQAM switching thresholds and then em
ploying the thresholds in the context of both AQAM and space-time coded OFDM [172] as
well aS frequency-domain spread MC-CDMA
Let commence our detailed discourse with a glimpse of history. In recent years the con
cept of intelligent multi-mode, multimedia transceivers (IMMT) has emerged in the context
of wireless systems [167–172, 179, 641, 647, 648]. The range of various existing solutions
that have found favour in already operational standard systems was summarised in the ex
cellent overview by Nanda et al. [648]. The aim of these adaptive transceivers is to provide
mobile users with the best possible compromise amongst a number of contradicting design
factors, such as the power consumption of the hand-held portable station (PS), robustness
against transmission errors, spectral efficiency, teletraffic capacity, audio/video quality and
so forth

658 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
The fundamental limitation of wireless systems is constituted by their time- and
frequency-domain channel fading, as illustrated in Figure 22.1 [170] in terms of the Signal
to-Noise Ratio (SNR) fluctuations experienced by a modem over a dispersive channel. The
violent SNR fluctuations observed both versus time and versus frequency suggest that over
these channels no fixed-mode transceiver can be expected to provide an attractive perfor
mance, complexity and delay trade-off. Motivated by the above mentioned performance
limitations of fixed-mode transceivers, IMMTs have attracted considerable research interest
in the past decade [167, 168, 179, 641, 647, 648]. Some of these research results are collated

Figure 22.1: Instantaneous channel SNR versus time and frequency for a 512-subcarrier OFDM mo
dem in the context of a single-transmitter single-receiver as well as for the spacetime
block code G2 [617] using one, two and six receivers when communicating over an in
door wireless channel. The average channel SNR is 10 dB. c©IEEE, Liew and Hanzo
[170, 649],
In Figure 22.1 we show the instantaneous channel SNR experienced by the subcarrier
OFDM symbols for a single-transmitter, single-receiver scheme and for the space-time block
code G2 [617] using one, two and six receivers over the shortened WATM channel. The av
erage channel SNR is 10 dB. We can see in Figure 22.1 that the variation of the instantaneous
channel SNR for a single transmitter and single receiver is severe. The instantaneous channel
SNR may become as low as 4 dB due to deep fades of the channel. On the other hand, we can
see that for the space-time block code G2 using one receiver the variation in the instantaneous
22.1. MOTIVATION
channel SNR is slower and less severe. Explicitly, by employing multiple transmit antennas
as shown in Figure 22.1, we have reduced the effect of the channels’ deep fades significantly
This is advantageous in the context of adaptive modulation schemes, since higher-order mod
ulation modes can be employed, in order to increase the throughput of the system. However
as we increase the number of receivers, i.e. the diversity order, we observe that the variation
of the channel becomes slower. Effectively, by employing higher-order diversity, the fading
channels have been converted to AWGN-like channels, as evidenced by the scenario employ
ing the space-time block code G2 using six receivers. Since adaptive modulation only offers
advantages over fading channels, we argue that using adaptive modulation might become
unnecessary, as the diversity order is increased. Hence, adaptive modulation can be viewed
as a lower-complexity alternative to space-time coding, since only a single transmitter and
receiver is required
The above mentioned calamities inflicted by the wireless channel can be mitigated
by contriving a suite of near-instantaneously adaptive or Burst-by-Burst Adaptive
(BbBA) wideband single-carrier [179], multi-carrier or Orthogonal Frequency Divi
sion Multiplex [172] (OFDM) as well as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
transceivers. The aim of these IMMTs is to communicate over hostile mobile channels
at a higher integrity or higher throughput, than conventional fixed-mode transceivers
A number of existing wireless systems already support some grade of adaptivity and
future research is likely to promote these principles further by embedding them into
the already existing standards. For example, due to their high control channel rate
and with the advent of the well-known Orthogonal Variable Spreading Factor OVSF
codes the third-generation UTRA/IMT2000 systems are amenable to not only longterm
spreading factor reconfiguration, but also to near-instantaneous reconfiguration on a
10ms transmission burst-duration basis. The High-Speed Data Packet Access HSDPA
mode of the third-generation wireless systems has also opted for using adaptive modu
lation [169] and adaptive chennel coding
With the advent of BbBA QAM, OFDM or CDMA transmissions it becomes possible for
mobile stations (MS) to invoke for example in indoor scenarios or in the central propagation
cell region - where typically benign channel conditions prevail - a high-throughput modula
tion mode, such as 4 bit/symbol Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16QAM). By contrast, a
robust, but low-throughput modulation mode, such as 1 bit/symbol Binary Phase Shift Key
ing (BPSK) can be employed near the edge of the propagation cell, where hostile propagation
conditions prevail. The BbBA QAM, OFDM or CDMA mode switching regime is also ca
pable of reconfiguring the transceiver at the rate of the channel’s slow- or even fastfading
This may prevent premature hand-overs and - more importantly - unnecessary powering up
which would inflict an increased interference upon co-channel users, resulting in further po
tential power increments. This detrimental process could result in all mobiles operating at
unnecessarily high power levels
A specific property of these transceivers is that their bit rate fluctuates, as a function of
time. This is not an impediment in the context of data transmission. However, in interactive
speech [168] or video [167] communications appropriate source codecs have to be designed
which are capable of promptly reconfiguring themselves according to the nearinstantaneous
bitrate budget provided by the transceiver
The expected performance of our BbBA transceivers can be characterised with the aid of
a whole plethora of performance indicators. In simple terms, adaptive modems outperform
660 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
their individual fixed-mode counterparts, since given an average number of transmitted bits
per symbol (BPS), their average BER will be lower than that of the fixed-mode modems
From a different perspective, at a given BER their BPS throughput will be always higher
In general, the higher the tolerable BER, the closer the performance to that of the Gaussian
channel capacity. Again, this fact underlines the importance of designing programmablerate
error-resilient source codecs - such as the Advanced Multi-Rate (AMR) speech codec to be
employed in UMTS - which do not expect a low BER
Similarly, when employing the above BbBA or AQAM principles in the frequency do
main in the context of OFDM [179] or in conjunction with OVSF spreading codes in CDMA
systems, attractive system design trade-offs and a high over-all performance can be at
tained [167]. However, despite the extensive research in the field by the international commu
nity, there is a whole host of problems that remain to be solved and this monograph intends
to contribute towards these efforts
22.2 Adaptation Principles
AQAM is suitable for duplex communication between the MS and BS, since the AQAM
modes have to be adapted and signalled between them, in order to allow channel quality
estimates and signalling to take place. The AQAM mode adaptation is the action of the
transmitter in response to time–varying channel conditions. In order to efficiently react to the
changes in channel quality, the following steps have to be taken
• Channel quality estimation: In order to appropriately select the transmission param
eters to be employed for the next transmission, a reliable estimation of the channel
transfer function during the next active transmit timeslot is necessary
• Choice of the appropriate parameters for the next transmission: Based on the predic
tion of the channel conditions for the next timeslot, the transmitter has to select the
appropriate modulation and channel coding modes for the subcarriers
• Signalling or blind detection of the employed parameters: The receiver has to be in
formed, as to which demodulator parameters to employ for the received packet. This
information can either be conveyed within the OFDM symbol itself, at the cost of loss
of effective data throughput, or the receiver can attempt to estimate the parameters
employed by the remote transmitter by means of blind detection mechanisms
22.3 Channel Quality Metrics
The most reliable channel quality estimate is the bit error rate (BER), since it reflects the
channel quality, irrespective of the source or the nature of the quality degradation. The BER
can be estimated invoking a number of approaches
Firstly, the BER can be estimated with a certain granularity or accuracy, provided that
the system entails a channel decoder or - synonymously - Forward Error Correction FEC
decoder employing algebraic decoding
Secondly, if the system contains a soft-in-soft-out (SISO) channel decoder, the BER can
be estimated with the aid of the Logarithmic Likelihood Ratio (LLR), evaluated either at the
22.4. TRANSCEIVER PARAMETER ADAPTATION
input or the output of the channel decoder. A particularly attractive way of invoking LLRs
is employing powerful turbo codecs, which provide a reliable indication of the confidence
associated with a particular bit decision in the context of LLRs
Thirdly, in the event that no channel encoder / decoder (codec) is used in the system, the
channel quality expressed in terms of the BER can be estimated with the aid of the mean
squared error (MSE) at the output of the channel equaliser or the closely related metric of
Pseudo-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (Pseudo-SNR) [167]. The MSE or pseudo-SNR at the output
of the channel equaliser have the important advantage that they are capable of quantifying the
severity of the inter-symbol-interference (ISI) and/or Co-channel Interference (CCI) experi
enced, in other words quantifying the Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio SINR
As an example, let us consider OFDM. In OFDM modems [179] the bit error proba
bility in each subcarrier can be determined by the fluctuations of the channel’s instantaneous
frequency domain channel transfer function Hn, if no co-channel interference is present. The
estimate Ĥn of the channel transfer function can be acquired by means of pilot–tone based
channel estimation [179]. For CDMA transceivers similar techniques are applicable, which
constitute the topic of this monograph
The delay between the channel quality estimation and the actual transmission of a burst in
relation to the maximal Doppler frequency of the channel is crucial as regards to the adaptive
system’s performance. If the channel estimate is obsolete at the time of transmission, then
poor system performance will result
22.4 Transceiver Parameter Adaptation
Different transmission parameters - such as the modulation and coding modes - of the AQAM
single- and multi-carrier as well as CDMA transceivers can be adapted to the anticipated
channel conditions. For example, adapting the number of modulation levels in response to
the anticipated SNR encountered in each OFDM subcarrier can be employed, in order to
achieve a wide range of different trade–offs between the received data integrity and through
put. Corrupted subcarriers can be excluded from data transmission and left blank or used for
example for Crest–factor reduction. A range of different algorithms for selecting the appro
priate modulation modes have to be investigated by future research. The adaptive channel
coding parameters entail code rate, adaptive interleaving and puncturing for convolu
tional and turbo codes, or varying block lengths for block codes
Based on the estimated frequency–domain channel transfer function, spectral predis
tortion at the transmitter of one or both communicating stations can be invoked, in or
der to partially of fully counteract the frequency–selective fading of the timedispersive
channel. Unlike frequency–domain equalisation at the receiver — which corrects for the
amplitude– and phase–errors inflicted upon the subcarriers by the channel, but which can
not improve the SNR in poor quality OFDM subchannels — spectral pre–distortion at the
OFDM transmitter can deliver near–constant signal–to–noise levels for all subcarriers and
can be viewed as power control on a subcarrier–by–subcarrier basis
In addition to improving the system’s BER performance in time–dispersive channels
spectral pre–distortion can be employed in order to perform all channel estimation and equal
isation functions at only one of the two communicating duplex stations. Low–cost, low power
consumption mobile stations can communicate with a base station that performs the channel

estimation and frequency–domain equalisation of the uplink, and uses the estimated channel
transfer function for pre–distorting the down–link OFDM symbol. This setup would lead
to different overall channel quality on the up– and downlink, and the superior preequalised
downlink channel quality could be exploited by using a computationally less complex chan
nel decoder, having weaker error correction capabilities in the mobile station than in the base
station
If the channel’s frequency–domain transfer function is to be fully counteracted by the
spectral pre-distortion upon adapting the subcarrier power to the inverse of the channel trans
fer function, then the output power of the transmitter can become excessive, if heavily faded
subcarriers are present in the system’s frequency range. In order to limit the transmitters
maximal output power, hybrid channel pre–distortion and adaptive modulation schemes can
be devised, which would de–activate transmission in deeply faded subchannels, while retain
ing the benefits of pre–distortion in the remaining subcarriers
BbBA mode signalling plays an important role in adaptive systems and the range of
signalling options is summarised in Figure 22.2 for closed–loop signalling. If the channel
quality estimation and parameter adaptation have been performed at the transmitter of a par
ticular link, based on open–loop adaptation, then the resulting set of parameters has to be
communicated to the receiver in order to successfully demodulate and decode the OFDM
symbol. Once the receiver determined the requested parameter set to be used by the re
mote transmitter, then this information has to be signalled to the remote transmitter in the
reverse link. If this signalling information is corrupted, then the receiver is generally unable
to correctly decode the OFDM symbol corresponding to the incorrect signalling information
yielding an OFDM symbol error
Unlike adaptive serial systems, which employ the same set of parameters for all data
symbols in a transmission packet [179], adaptive OFDM systems [179] have to react to the
frequency selective nature of the channel, by adapting the modem parameters across the sub
carriers. The resulting signalling overhead may become significantly higher than that for se
rial modems, and can be prohibitive for example for subcarrier–by–subcarrier based modula
tion mode adaptation. In order to overcome these limitations, efficient and reliable signalling
22.5. MILESTONES IN ADAPTIVE MODULATION HISTORY
techniques have to be employed for practical implementation of adaptive OFDM modems
If some flexibility in choosing the transmission parameters is sacrificed in an adaptation
scheme, like in sub–band adaptive OFDM schemes [179], then the amount of signalling can
be reduced. Alternatively, blind parameter detection schemes can be devised, which require
little or no OFDM mode signalling information, respectively
In conclusion, fixed mode transceivers are incapable of achieving a good trade-off in
terms of performance and complexity. The proposed BbB adaptive system design paradigm
is more promising in this respect. A range of problems and solutions were highlighted in
conceptual terms with reference to an OFDM-based example, indicating the areas, where
substantial future research is required. A specific research topic, which raised substantial
research interest recently is invoking efficient channel quality prediction techniques
Before we commence our indepth discourse in the forthcoming chapters, in the next section
we provide a brief historical perspective on adaptive modulation
22.5 Milestones in Adaptive Modulation History
22.5.1 Adaptive Single- and Multi-carrier Modulation
A comprehensive overview of adaptive transceivers was provided in [169] and this section is
also based on [169]. As we noted in the previous chapters, mobile communications channels
typically exhibit a near-instantaneously fluctuating time-variant channel quality
and hence conventional fixed-mode modems suffer from bursts of transmission errors, even
if the system was designed for providing a high link margin. An efficient approach to mitigat
ing these detrimental effects is to adaptively adjust the modulation and/or the channel coding
format as well as a range of other system parameters based on the near-instantaneous chan
nel quality information perceived by the receiver, which is fed back to the transmitter with the
aid of a feedback channel [173]. This plausible principle was recognised by Hayes [173] as
early as
It was also shown in the previous sections that these near-instantaneously adaptive
schemes require a reliable feedback link from the receiver to the transmitter. However, the
channel quality variations have to be sufficiently slow for the transmitter to be able to adapt its
modulation and/or channel coding format appropriately. The performance of these schemes
can potentially be enhanced with the aid of channel quality prediction techniques [174]. As
an efficient fading counter-measure, Hayes [173] proposed the employment of transmission
power adaptation, while Cavers [175] suggested invoking a variable symbol duration scheme
in response to the perceived channel quality at the expense of a variable bandwidth require
ment. A disadvantage of the variable-power scheme is that it increases both the average
transmitted power requirements and the level of co-channel interference imposed on other
users, while requiring a high-linearity class-A or AB power amplifier, which exhibit a low
power-efficiency. As a more attractive alternative, the employment of AQAM was proposed
by Steele and Webb, which circumvented some of the above-mentioned disadvantages by
employing various star-QAM constellations [122,
With the advent of Pilot Symbol Assisted Modulation (PSAM) [138, 139, 177], Otsuki et
al. [178] employed square-shaped AQAM constellations instead of star constellations
as a practical fading counter measure. With the aid of analysing the channel capacity of
Rayleigh fading channels [180], Goldsmith et al. [181] and Alouini et al. [182] showed
664 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
that combined variable-power, variable-rate adaptive schemes are attractive in terms of ap
proaching the capacity of the channel and characterised the achievable throughput perfor
mance of variable-power AQAM [181]. However, they also found that the extra through
put achieved by the additional variable-power assisted adaptation over the constantpower
variable-rate scheme is marginal for most types of fading channels [181,
In 1996 Torrance and Hanzo [184] proposed a set of mode switching levels s designed for
achieving a high average BPS throughput, while maintaining the target average BER. Their
method was based on defining a specific combined BPS/BER cost-function for transmission
over narrowband Rayleigh channels, which incorporated both the BPS throughput as well as
the target average BER of the system. Powell’s optimisation was invoked for finding a set
of mode switching thresholds, which were constant, regardless of the actual channel Signal
to Noise Ratio (SNR) encountered, i.e. irrespective of the prevalent instantaneous channel
conditions. However, in 2001 Choi and Hanzo [185] noted that a higher BPS throughput can
be achieved, if under high channel SNR conditions the activation of high-throughput AQAM
modes is further encouraged by lowering the AQAM mode switching thresholds. More explic
itly, a set of SNR-dependent AQAM mode switching levels was proposed [185], which keeps
the average BER constant, while maximising the achievable throughput. We note furthermore
that the set of switching levels derived in [184, 186] is based on Powell’s multidimensional
optimisation technique [187] and hence the optimisation process may become trapped in a lo
cal minimum. This problem was overcome by Choi and Hanzo upon deriving an optimum set
of switching levels [185], when employing the Lagrangian multiplier technique. It was shown
that this set of switching levels results in the global optimum in a sense that the corresponding
AQAM scheme obtains the maximum possible average BPS throughput, while maintaining
the target average BER. An important further development was Tang’s contribution [188] in
the area of contriving an intelligent learning scheme for the appropriate adjustment of the
AQAM switching thresholds
These contributions demonstrated that AQAM exhibited promising advantages, when
compared to fixed modulation schemes in terms of spectral efficiency, BER performance
and robustness against channel delay spread, etc. Various systems employing AQAM were
also characterised in [179]. The numerical upper bound performance of narrow-band BbB
AQAM over slow Rayleigh flat-fading channels was evaluated by Torrance and Hanzo
while over wide-band channels by Wong and Hanzo [190, 191]. Following these develop
ments, adaptive modulation was also studied in conjunction with channel coding and power
control techniques by Matsuoka et al. [192] as well as Goldsmith and Chua [193,
In the early phase of research more emphasis was dedicated to the system aspects of
adaptive modulation in a narrow-band environment. A reliable method of transmitting the
modulation control parameters was proposed by Otsuki et al. [178], where the parameters
were embedded in the transmission frame’s mid-amble using Walsh codes. Subsequently, at
the receiver the Walsh sequences were decoded using maximum likelihood detection. An
other technique of signalling the required modulation mode used was proposed by Torrance
and Hanzo [195], where the modulation control symbols were represented by unequal error
protection 5-PSK symbols. Symbol-by-Symbol (SbS) adaptive, rather than BbBadaptive
systems were proposed by Lau and Maric in [196], where the transmitter is capable of trans
mitting each symbol in a different modem mode, depending on the channel conditions. Natu
rally, the receiver has to synchronise with the transmitter in terms of the SbS-adapted mode
sequence, in order to correctly demodulate the received symbols and hence the employment
22.5. MILESTONES IN ADAPTIVE MODULATION HISTORY
of BbB-adaptivity is less challenging, while attaining a similar performance to that of BbB
adaptive arrangements under typical channel conditions
The adaptive modulation philosophy was then extended to wideband multi-path environ
ments amongst others for example by Kamio et al. [197] by utilizing a bi-directional Decision
Feedback Equaliser (DFE) in a micro- and macro-cellular environment. This equalization
technique employed both forward and backward oriented channel estimation based on the
pre-amble and post-amble symbols in the transmitted frame. Equalizer tap gain interpolation
across the transmitted frame was also utilized for reducing the complexity in conjunction
with space diversity [197]. The authors concluded that the cell radius could be enlarged in
a macro-cellular system and a higher area-spectral efficiency could be attained for micro
cellular environments by utilizing adaptive modulation. The data transmission latency ef
fect, which occurred when the input data rate was higher than the instantaneous transmission
throughput was studied and solutions were formulated using frequency hopping [198] and
statistical multiplexing, where the number of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) times
lots allocated to a user was adaptively controlled
In reference [200] symbol rate adaptive modulation was applied, where the symbol rate or
the number of modulation levels was adapted by using 18 -rate QAM

4 -rate QAM

2 rate
16QAM as well as full-rate 16QAM and the criterion used for adapting the modem modes
was based on the instantaneous received signal to noise ratio and channel delay spread. The
slowly varying channel quality of the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) was rendered similar
by utilizing short frame duration Time Division Duplex (TDD) and the maximum normalised
delay spread simulated was 0.1. A variable channel coding rate was then introduced by Mat
suoka et al. in conjunction with adaptive modulation in reference [192], where the transmitted
burst incorporated an outer Reed Solomon code and an inner convolutional code in order to
achieve high-quality data transmission. The coding rate was varied according to the preva
lent channel quality using the same method, as in adaptive modulation in order to achieve a
certain target BER performance. A so-called channel margin was introduced in this contri
bution, which effectively increased the switching thresholds for the sake of preempting the
effects of channel quality estimation errors, although this inevitably reduced the achievable
BPS throughput
In an effort to improve the achievable performance versus complexity trade-off in the
context of AQAM, Yee and Hanzo [201] studied the design of various Radial Basis Func
tion (RBF) assisted neural network based schemes, while communicating over dispersive
channels. The advantage of these RBF-aided DFEs is that they are capable of delivering
error-free decisions even in scenarios, when the received phasors cannot be error-freely de
tected by the conventional DFE, since they cannot be separated into decision classes with
the aid of a linear decision boundary. In these so-called linearly non-separable decision sce
narios the RBF-assisted DFE still may remain capable of classifying the received phasors
into decision classes without decision errors. A further improved turbo BCH-coded version
of this RBF-aided system was characterised by Yee et al. in [202], while a turboequalised
RBF arrangement was the subject of the investigation conducted by Yee, Liew and Hanzo
in [203, 204]. The RBF-aided AQAM research has also been extended to the turbo equali
sation of a convolutional as well as space-time trellis coded arrangement proposed by Yee
Yeap and Hanzo [169,205,206]. The same authors then endeavoured to reduce the associated
implementation complexity of an RBF-aided QAM modem with the advent of employing a
separate in-phase / quadrature-phase turbo equalisation scheme in the quadrature arms of the
666 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
modem
As already mentioned above, the performance of channel coding in conjunction with
adaptive modulation in a narrow-band environment was also characterised by Chua and
Goldsmith [193]. In their contribution trellis and lattice codes were used without channel
interleaving, invoking a feedback path between the transmitter and receiver for modem mode
control purposes. Specifically, the simulation and theoretical results by Goldsmith and Chua
showed that a 3dB coding gain was achievable at a BER of 10−6 for a 4-sate trellis code
and 4dB by an 8-state trellis code in the context of the adaptive scheme over Rayleighfading
channels, while a 128-state code performed within 5dB of the Shannonian capacity limit
The effects of the delay in the AQAM mode signalling feedback path on the adaptive mo
dem’s performance were studied and this scheme exhibited a higher spectral efficiency, when
compared to the non-adaptive trellis coded performance. Goeckel [207] also contributed in
the area of adaptive coding and employed realistic outdated, rather than perfect fading esti
mates. Further research on adaptive multidimensional coded modulation was also conducted
by Hole et al. [208] for transmissions over flat fading channels. Pearce, Burr and Tozer
as well as Lau and Mcleod [210] have also analysed the performance trade-offs associated
with employing channel coding and adaptive modulation or adaptive trellis coding, respec
tively, as efficient fading counter measures. In an effort to provide a fair comparison of the
various coded modulation schemes known at the time of writing, Ng, Wong and Hanzo have
also studied Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM), Turbo TCM (TTCM), Bit-Interleaved Coded
Modulation (BICM) and Iterative-Decoding assisted BICM (BICM-ID), where TTCM was
found to be the best scheme at a given decoding complexity
Subsequent contributions by Suzuki et al. [212] incorporated space-diversity and power
adaptation in conjunction with adaptive modulation, for example in order to combat the ef
fects of the multi-path channel environment at a 10Mbits/s transmission rate. The maximum
tolerable delay-spread was deemed to be one symbol duration for a target mean BER perfor
mance of 0.1%. This was achieved in a TDMA scenario, where the channel estimates were
predicted based on the extrapolation of previous channel quality estimates. As mentioned
above, variable transmitted power was applied in combination with adaptive modulation in
reference [194], where the transmission rate and power adaptation was optimised for the sake
of achieving an increased spectral efficiency. In their treatise a slowly varying channel was
assumed and the instantaneous received power required for achieving a certain upper bound
performance was assumed to be known prior to transmission. Power control in conjunction
with a pre-distortion type non-linear power amplifier compensator was studied in the context
of adaptive modulation in reference [213]. This method was used to mitigate the nonlinearity
effects associated with the power amplifier, when QAM modulators were used
Results were also recorded concerning the performance of adaptive modulation in con
junction with different multiple access schemes in a narrow-band channel environment. In a
TDMA system, dynamic channel assignment was employed by Ikeda et al., where in addition
to assigning a different modulation mode to a different channel quality, priority was always
given to those users in their request for reserving time-slots, which benefitted from the best
channel quality [214]. The performance was compared to fixed channel assignment systems
where substantial gains were achieved in terms of system capacity. Furthermore, a lower
call termination probability was recorded. However, the probability of intra-cell handoff
increased as a result of the associated dynamic channel assignment (DCA) scheme, which
constantly searched for a high-quality, high-throughput time-slot for supporting the actively
22.5. MILESTONES IN ADAPTIVE MODULATION HISTORY
communicating users. The application of adaptive modulation in packet transmission was
introduced by Ue, Sampei and Morinaga [215], where the results showed an improved BPS
throughput. The performance of adaptive modulation was also characterised in conjunction
with an automatic repeat request (ARQ) system in reference [216], where the transmitted
bits were encoded using a cyclic redundant code (CRC) and a convolutional punctured code
in order to increase the data throughput
A further treatise was published by Sampei, Morinaga and Hamaguchi [217] on labora
tory test results concerning the utilization of adaptive modulation in a TDD scenario, where
the modem mode switching criterion was based on the signal to noise ratio and on the nor
malised delay-spread. In these experimental results, the channel quality estimation errors
degraded the performance and consequently - as laready alluded to earlier - a channel esti
mation error margin was introduced for mitigating this degradation. Explicitly, the channel
estimation error margin was defined as the measure of how much extra protection margin
must be added to the switching threshold levels for the sake of minimising the effects of the
channel estimation errors. The delay-spread also degraded the achievable performance due
to the associated irreducible BER, which was not compensated by the receiver. However
the performance of the adaptive scheme in a delay-spread impaired channel environment was
better, than that of a fixed modulation scheme. These experiments also concluded that the
AQAM scheme can be operated for a Doppler frequency of fd = 10Hz at a normalised delay
spread of 0.1 or for fd = 14Hz at a normalised delay spread of 0.02, which produced a mean
BER of 0.1% at a transmission rate of 1 Mbitss
Lastly, the data buffering-induced latency and co-channel interference aspects of AQAM
modems were investigated in [218, 219]. Specifically, the latency associated with storing the
information to be transmitted during severely degraded channel conditions was mitigated by
frequency hopping or statistical multiplexing. As expected, the latency is increased, when
either the mobile speed or the channel SNR are reduced, since both of these result in pro
longed low instantaneous SNR intervals. It was demonstrated that as a result of the proposed
measures, typically more than 4dB SNR reduction was achieved by the proposed adaptive
modems in comparison to the conventional fixed-mode benchmark modems employed. How
ever, the achievable gains depend strongly on the prevalant co-channel interference levels and
hence interference cancellation was invoked in [219] on the basis of adjusting the demodula
tion decision boundaries after estimating the interfering channel’s magnitude and phase
The associated principles can also be invoked in the context of multicarrier Orthogonal
Frequency Division Multiplex (OFDM) modems [179]. This principle was first proposed by
Kalet [154] and was then further developed for example by Czylwik et al. [220] as well as by
Chow, Cioffi and Bingham [221]. The associated concepts were detailed for example in
and will be also augmented in this monograph. Let us now briefly review the recent history
of the BbB adaptive concept in the context of CDMA in the next section
22.5.2 Adaptive Code Division Multiple Access
The techniques described in the context of single- and multi-carrier modulation are concep
tually similar to multi-rate transmission [650] in CDMA systems. However, in BbB adaptive
CDMA the transmission rate is modified according to the near-instantaneous channel quality
instead of the service required by the mobile user. BbB-adaptive CDMA systems are also
useful for employment in arbitrary propagation environments or in hand-over scenarios, such
668 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
as those encountered, when a mobile user moves from an indoor to an outdoor environment or
in a so-called ’birth-death’ scenario, where the number of transmitting CDMA users changes
frequently [651], thereby changing the interference dramatically. Various methods of multi
rate transmission have been proposed in the research literature. Below we will briefly discuss
some of the recent research issues in multi-rate and adaptive CDMA schemes
Ottosson and Svensson compared various multi-rate systems [650], including multiple
spreading factor (SF) based, multi-code and multi-level modulation schemes. According
to the multi-code philosophy, the SF is kept constant for all users, but multiple spreading
codes transmitted simultaneously are assigned to users requiring higher bit rates. In this case
- unless the spreading codes’s perfect orthogonality is retained after transmission over the
channel - the multiple codes of a particular user interfere with each other. This inevitebly
reduces the system’s performance
Multiple data rates can also be supported by a variable SF scheme, where the chip rate is
kept constant, but the data rates are varied, thereby effectively changing the SF of the spread
ing codes assigned to the users; at a fixed chip rate the lower the SF, the higher the supported
data rate. Performance comparisons for both of these schemes have been carried out by Ottos
son and Svensson [650], as well as by Ramakrishna and Holtzman [652], demonstrating that
both schemes achieved a similar performance. Adachi, Ohno, Higashi, Dohi and Okumura
proposed the employment of multi-code CDMA in conjunction with pilot symbolassisted
channel estimation, RAKE reception and antenna diversity for providing multi-rate capabili
ties [653,654]. The employment of multi-level modulation schemes was also investigated by
Ottosson and Svensson [650], where higher-rate users were assigned higher-order modulation
modes, transmitting several bits per symbol. However, it was concluded that the performance
experienced by users requiring higher rates was significantly worse, than that experienced
by the lower-rate users. The use of M -ary orthogonal modulation in providing variable rate
transmission was investigated by Schotten, Elders-Boll and Busboom [655]. According to
this method, each user was assigned an orthogonal sequence set, where the number of se
quences, M , in the set was dependent on the data rate required – the higher the rate required
the larger the sequence set. Each sequence in the set was mapped to a particular combination
of b = (log2 M) bits to be transmitted. The M -ary sequence was then spread with the aid of a
spreading code of a constant SF before transmission. It was found [655] that the performance
of the system depended not only on the MAI, but also on the Hamming distance between the
sequences in the M -ary sequence set
Saquib and Yates [656] investigated the employment of the decorrelating detector in con
junction with the multiple-SF scheme and proposed a modified decorrelating detector, which
utilized soft decisions and maximal ratio combining, in order to detect the bits of the different
rate users. Multi-rate transmission schemes involving interference cancellation receivers have
previously been investigated amongst others by Johansson and Svensson [657,658], as well as
by Juntti [659]. Typically, multiple users transmitting at different bit rates are supported in the
same CDMA system invoking multiple codes or different spreading factors. SIC schemes and
multi-stage cancellation schemes were used at the receiver for mitigating the MAI
where the bit rate of the users was dictated by the user requirements. The performance com
parison of various multiuser detectors in the context of a multiple-SF transmission scheme
was presented for example by Juntti [659], where the detectors compared were the decorrela
tor, the PIC receiver and the so-called group serial interference cancellation (GSIC) receiver
It was concluded that the GSIC and the decorrelator performed better than the PIC receiver
22.5. MILESTONES IN ADAPTIVE MODULATION HISTORY
but all the interference cancellation schemes including the GSIC, exhibited an error floor at
high SNRs due to error propagation
The bit rate of each user can also be adapted according to the near-instantaneous channel
quality, in order to mitigate the effects of channel quality fluctuations. Kim [660] analysed
the performance of two different methods of combating the near-instantaneous quality varia
tions of the mobile channel. Specifically, Kim studied the adaptation of the transmitter power
or the switching of the information rate, in order to suit the near-instantaneous channel con
ditions. It was demonstrated using a RAKE receiver that rate adaptation provided a higher
average information rate, than power adaptation for a given average transmit power and a
given BER [660]. Abeta, Sampei and Morinaga [661] conducted investigations into an adap
tive packet transmission based CDMA scheme, where the transmission rate was modified by
varying the channel code rate and the processing gain of the CDMA user, employing the car
rier to interference plus noise ratio (CINR) as the switching metric. When the channel quality
was favourable, the instantaneous bit rate was increased and conversely, the instantaneous bit
rate was reduced when the channel quality dropped. In order to maintain a constant overall
bit rate, when a high instantaneous bit rate was employed, the duration of the transmission
burst was reduced. Conversely, when the instantaneous bit rate was low, the duration of the
burst was extended. This resulted in a decrease in interference power, which translated to
an increase in system capacity. Hashimoto, Sampei and Morinaga [662] extended this work
also to demonstrate that the proposed system was capable of achieving a higher user capacity
with a reduced hand-off margin and lower average transmitter power. In these schemes the
conventional RAKE receiver was used for the detection of the data symbols. A variablerate
CDMA scheme – where the transmission rate was modified by varying the channel code rate
and, correspondingly, the M -ary modulation constellations – was investigated by Lau and
Maric [196]. As the channel code rate was increased, the bit-rate was increased by increasing
M correspondingly in the M -ary modulation scheme. Another adaptive system was proposed
by Tateesh, Atungsiri and Kondoz [663], where the rates of the speech and channel codecs
were varied adaptively [663]. In their adaptive system, the gross transmitted bit rate was kept
constant, but the speech codec and channel codec rates were varied according to the channel
quality. When the channel quality was low, a lower rate speech codec was used, resulting in
increased redundancy and thus a more powerful channel code could be employed. This re
sulted in an overall coding gain, although the speech quality dropped with decreasing speech
rate. A variable rate data transmission scheme was proposed by Okumura and Adachi
where the fluctuating transmission rate was mapped to discontinuous transmission, in order
to reduce the interference inflicted upon the other users, when there was no transmission
The transmission rate was detected blindly at the receiver with the help of cyclic redundancy
check decoding and RAKE receivers were employed for coherent reception, where pilot
symbol-assisted channel estimation was performed
The information rate can also be varied according to the channel quality, as it will be
demonstrated shortly. However, in comparison to conventional power control techniques
which again, may disadvantage other users in an effort to maintain the quality of the links
considered - the proposed technique does not disadvantage other users and increases the net
work capacity [169, 665]. The instantaneous channel quality can be estimated at the receiver
and the chosen information rate can then be communicated to the transmitter via explicit sig
nalling in a so-called closed-loop controlled scheme. Conversely, in an open-loop scheme
provided that the downlink and uplink channels exhibit a similar quality - the information rate

to the uplink and vice versa. The validity of the uplink/downlink similarity in TDDCDMA
systems has been studied by Miya et al. [580], Kato et al. [581] and Jeong et al.
22.6 Increasing the Average Transmit Power as a
Fading CounterMeasure
The radio frequency (RF) signal radiated from the transmitter’s antenna takes different routes
experiencing defraction, scattering and reflections, before it arrives at the receiver. Each
multi-path component arriving at the receiver simultaneously adds constructively or destruc
tively, resulting in fading of the combined signal. When there is no line-of-sight component
amongst these signals, the combined signal is characterized by Rayleigh fading. The in
stantaneous SNR (iSNR), γ, per transmitted symbol1 is depicted in Figure 22.3 for a typical
Rayleigh fading using the thick line. The Probability Density Function (PDF) of γ is given
1When no diversity is employed at the receiver, the SNR per symbol, γ, is the same as the channel SNR, γc. In
this case, we will use the term “SNR” without any adjective

As we can observe in Figure 22.3, pm(γ) exhibits high values during the deep channel enve
lope fades, where even the most robust modulation mode, namely BPSK, exhibits a bit error
probability p2(γ) > 10−1. By contrast even the error probability of the high-throughput
QAM mode, namely p16(γ), is below 10−2, when the iSNR γ exhibits a high peak. This wide
variation of the communication link’s quality is a fundamental problem in wireless radio com
munication systems. Hence, numerous techniques have been developed for combating this
problem, such as increasing the average transmit power, invoking diversity, channel inversion
channel coding and/or adaptive modulation techniques. In this section we will investigate the
efficiency of employing an increased average transmit power
As we observed in Figure 22.3, the instantaneous Bit Error Probability (BEP) becomes
excessive for sustaining an adequate service quality during instances, when the signal expe
riences a deep channel envelope fade. Let us define the cut-off BEP pc, below which the
Quality Of Service (QOS) becomes unacceptable. Then the outage probability Pout can be
defined as
Pout(γ̄, pc) , Pr[ pm(γ) > pc ] ,
where γ̄ is the average channel SNR dependent on the transmit power, pc is the cut-off BEP
and pm(γ) is the instantaneous BEP, conditioned on γ, for an m-ary modulation mode, given
for example by (22.2). We can reduce the outage probability of (22.4) by increasing the

transmit power, and hence increasing the average channel SNR γ̄. Let us briefly investigate
the efficiency of this scheme
Figure 22.4(a) depicts the instantaneous BEP as a function of the instantaneous channel
SNR. Once the cut-off BEP pc is determined as a QOS-related design parameter, the cor
responding cut-off SNR γo can be determined, as shown for example in Figure 22.4(a) for
pc = 0.05. Then, the outage probability of (22.4) can be calculated as
Pout = Pr[ γ < γo ] ,
and in physically tangible terms its value is equal to the area under the PDF curve of Fig
ure 22.4(b) surrounded by the left y-axis and γ = γo vertical line. Upon taking into account
that for high SNRs the PDFs of Figure 22.4(b) are near-linear, this area can be approximated
by γo/γ̄, considering that fγ̄(0) = 1/γ̄. Hence, the outage probability is inversely propor
tional to the transmit power, requiring an approximately 10-fold increased transmit power
for reducing the outage probability by an order of magnitude, as seen in Figure 22.4(c). The
exact value of the outage probability is given by

recorded for the cut-off BEP of pc = 0.05, where we can confirm the validity of the linearly
approximated outage probability2, when we have Pout <

Figure 22.5: Stylised model of near-instantaneous adaptive modulation scheme
In conclusion, we studied the efficiency of increasing the average transmit power as a
fading counter-measure and found that the outage probability as well as the average bit error
probability are inversely proportional to the average transmit power. Since the maximum
radiated powers of modems are regulated in order to reduce the co-channel interference and
transmit power, the acceptable transmit power increase may be limited and hence employing
this technique may not be sufficiently effective for achieving the desired link performance
We will show that the AQAM philosophy of the next section is a more attractive solution to
the problem of channel quality fluctuation experienced in wireless systems
22.7 System Description
A stylised model of our adaptive modulation scheme is illustrated in Figure 22.5, which
can be invoked in conjunction with any power control scheme. In our adaptive modulation
scheme, the modulation mode used is adapted on a near-instantaneous basis for the sake of
counteracting the effects of fading. Let us describe the detailed operation of the adaptive mo
dem scheme of Figure 22.5. Firstly, the channel quality ξ is estimated by the remote receiver
B. This channel quality measure ξ can be the instantaneous channel SNR, the Radio Signal
Strength Indicator (RSSI) output of the receiver [176], the decoded BER [176], the Signal to
Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) estimated at the output of the channel equalizer
or the SINR at the output of a CDMA joint detector [669]. The estimated channel quality per
ceived by receiver B is fed back to transmitter A with the aid of a feedback channel, as seen
in Figure 22.5. Then, the transmit mode control block of transmitter A selects the highest
throughput modulation mode k capable of maintaining the target BEP based on the channel
quality measure ξ and the specific set of adaptive mode switching levels s. Once k is selected
mk-ary modulation is performed at transmitter A in order to generate the transmitted signal
s(t), and the signal s(t) is transmitted through the channel
The general model and the set of important parameters specifying our constantpower
adaptive modulation scheme are described in the next subsection in order to develop the

underlying general theory. Then, in Subsection 22.7.2 several application examples are intro
duced
22.7.1 General Model
A K-mode adaptive modulation scheme adjusts its transmit mode k, where k
{0, 1 · · · K − 1}, by employing mk-ary modulation according to the nearinstantaneous
channel quality ξ perceived by receiver B of Figure 22.5. The mode selection rule is given
by
Choose mode k when sk ≤ ξ < sk+1 ,
where a switching level sk belongs to the set s = {sk | k = 0, 1, · · · ,K}. The Bits Per
Symbol (BPS) throughput bk of a specific modulation mode k is given by bk = log2(mk) if
mk 6= 0, otherwise bk =0. It is convenient to define the incremental BPS ck as ck bkbk
when k > 0 and c0 =b0, which quantifies the achievable BPS increase, when switching from
the lower-throughput mode k−1 to mode k
22.7.2 Examples
22.7.2.1 Five-Mode AQAM
A five-mode AQAM system has been studied extensively by many researchers, which was
motivated by the high performance of the Gray-mapped constituent modulation modes used

tigation, the near-instantaneous channel quality ξ is defined as instantaneous channel SNR
γ. The boundary switching levels are given as s0 = 0 and s5 = ∞. Figure 22.6 illustrates
operation of the five-mode AQAM scheme over a typical narrow-band Rayleigh fading chan
nel scenario. Transmitter A of Figure 22.5 keeps track of the channel SNR γ perceived by
receiver B with the aid of a low-BER, low-delay feedback channel - which can be created for
example by superimposing the values of ξ on the reverse direction transmitted messages of
transmitter B - and determines the highest-BPS modulation mode maintaining the target BEP
depending on which region γ falls into. The channel-quality related SNR regions are divided
by the modulation mode switching levels sk. More explicitly, the set of AQAM switching lev
els {sk} is determined such that the average BPS throughput is maximised, while satisfying
the average target BEP requirement, Ptarget. We assumed a target BEP of Ptarget =

Webb and Steele revived the research community’s interest on adaptive modulation, although
a similar concept was initially suggested by Hayes [173] in the 1960s. Webb and Steele re
ported the performance of adaptive star-QAM systems [176]. The parameters of their system
are summarised in Table

22.7.3 Characteristic Parameters
In this section, we introduce several parameters in order to characterize our adaptive mod
ulation scheme. The constituent mode selection probability (MSP) Mk is defined as the
probability of selecting the k-th mode from the set of K possible modulation modes, which
can be calculated as a function of the channel quality metric ξ, regardless of the specific

Mk = Pr[ sk ≤ ξ < sk+1 ]

∫ sk

where sk denotes the mode switching levels and f(ξ) is the probability density func

as

which in simple verbal terms can be formulated as the weighted sum of the throughput bk of

Let us now assume that we use the instantaneous SNR γ as the channel quality measure
which implies that no co-channel interference is present. By contrast, when operating in a co
channel interference limited environment, we can use the instantaneous SINR as the channel
quality measure ξ, provided that the co-channel interference has a near-Gaussian distribution
In such scenario, the mode-specific average BEP Pk can be written as
Pk
∫ sk

pmk(γ) f(γ) dγ ,
where pmk(γ) is the BEP of the mk-ary constituent modulation mode over the AWGN chan
nel and we used γ instead of ξ in order to explicitly indicate the employment of γ as the
channel quality measure. Then, the average BEP Pavg of our adaptive modulation scheme
22.7. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
can be represented as the sum of the BEPs of the specific constituent modes divided by the
average adaptive modem throughput B, formulated as

where bk is the BPS throughput of the k-th modulation mode, Pk is the mode-specific average
BEP given in (22.20) and B is the average adaptive modem throughput given in (22.15) or in

The aim of our adaptive system is to transmit as high a number of bits per symbol as
possible, while providing the required Quality of Service (QOS). More specifically, we are
aiming for maximizing the average BPS throughput B of (22.14), while satisfying the aver
age BEP requirement of Pavg ≤ Ptarget. Hence, we have to satisfy the constraint of meeting
Ptarget, while optimizing the design parameter of s, which is the set of modulationmode
switching levels. The determination of optimum switching levels will be investigated in Sec
tion 22.8. Since the calculation of the optimum switching levels typically requires the numer
ical computation of the parameters introduced in this section, it is advantageous to express
the parameters in a closed form, which is the objective of the next section
22.7.3.1 Closed Form Expressions for Transmission over Nakagami Fading Channels

where the parameter m governs the severity of fading and Γ(m) is the Gamma function
When m = 1, the PDF of (22.22) is reduced to the PDF of γ over Rayleigh fading channel
which is given in (22.1). As m increases, the fading behaves like Rician fading, and it be
comes the AWGN channel, when m tends to ∞. Here we restrict the value of m to be
a positive integer. In this case, the Nakagami fading model of (22.22), having a mean of
γ̄s = mγ̄, will be used to describe the PDF of the SNR per symbol γs in an m-antenna based
diversity assisted system employing Maximal Ratio Combining MRC
When the instantaneous channel SNR γ is used as the channel quality measure ξ in our
adaptive modulation scheme transmitting over a Nakagami channel, the parameters defined in
Section 22.7.3 can be expressed in a closed form. Specifically, the mode selection probability

The corresponding performance results of the adaptive modulation schemes communicating
over a flat-fading Rayleigh channel are presented in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the schemes

b(γ) by the thick line at the bottom. The average SNR is γ̄ = 10dB. (b) As the average
SNR increases, the higher-order AQAM modes are selected more often
22.8.1 Limiting the Peak Instantaneous BEP
The first attempt of finding the optimum switching levels that are capable of satisfying var
ious transmission integrity requirements was made by Webb and Steele [176]. They used
the BEP curves of each constituent modulation mode, obtained from simulations over an
AWGN channel, in order to find the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values, where each modu
lation mode satisfies the target BEP requirement [179]. This intuitive concept of determining
the switching levels has been widely used by researchers [178, 183] since then. The regime
proposed by Webb and Steele can be used for ensuring that the instantaneous BEP always
remains below a certain threshold BEP Pth. In order to satisfy this constraint, the first mod
ulation mode should be “no transmission”. In this case, the set of switching levels s is given
by
s = { s0 = 0, sk | pmk(sk) = Pth k ≥ 1} .
Figure 22.7 illustrates how this scheme operates over a Rayleigh channel, using the example
of the five-mode AQAM scheme described in Section 22.7.2.1. The average SNR was γ̄
10dB and the instantaneous target BEP was Pth = 3 × 10−2. Using the expression given in
(22.2) for pmk , the set of switching levels can be calculated for the instantaneous target BEP
which is given by s1 = 1.769, s2 = 3.537, s3 = 15.325 and s4 = 55.874. We can observe
that the instantaneous BEP represented as a thin line by the middle of trace of Figure a

widens. (b) The SNR gains of AQAM over the fixed-mode QAM scheme required for
achieving the same BPS throughput at the same average BEP of Pavg are in the range of
5dB to dB
was limited to values below Pth = 3×
At this particular average SNR predominantly the QPSK modulation mode was invoked
However, when the instantaneous channel quality is high, 16-QAM was invoked in order to
increase the BPS throughput. The mode selection probability Mk of (22.24) is shown in
Figure 22.7(b). Again, when the average SNR is γ̄ = 10dB, the QPSK mode is selected most
often, namely with the probability of about 0.5. The 16-QAM, No-Tx and BPSK modes have
had the mode selection probabilities of 0.15 to 0.2, while 64-QAM is not likely to be selected
in this situation. When the average SNR increases, the next higher order modulation mode
becomes the dominant modulation scheme one by one and eventually the highest order of
64-QAM mode of the five-mode AQAM scheme prevails
The effects of the number of modulation modes used in our AQAM scheme on the perfor
mance are depicted in Figure 22.8. The average BEP performance portrayed in Figure a
shows that the AQAM schemes maintain an average BEP lower than the peak instantaneous
BEP of Pth = 3×10−2 even in the low SNR region, at the cost of a reduced average through
put, which can be observed in Figure 22.8(b). As the number of the constituent modulation
modes employed of the AQAM increases, the SNR regions, where the average BEP is near
constant around Pavg = 10−2 expands to higher average SNR values. We can observe that
the AQAM scheme maintains a constant SNR gain over the highest-order constituent fixed
QAM mode, as the average SNR increases, at the cost of a negligible BPS throughput degra
dation. This is because the AQAM activates the low-order modulation modes or disables
transmissions completely, when the channel envelope is in a deep fade, in order to avoid

Figure 22.9: The performance of the six-mode AQAM employing the switching levels of (22.38) de
signed for limiting the peak instantaneous BEP
inflicting bursts of bit errors
Figure 22.8(b) compares the average BPS throughput of the AQAM scheme employing
various numbers of AQAM modes and those of the fixed QAM constituent modes achieving
the same average BER. When we want to achieve the target throughput of Bavg = 1 BPS
using the AQAM scheme, Figure 22.8(b) suggest that 3-mode AQAM employing NoTx
BPSK and QPSK is as good as four-mode AQAM, or in fact any other AQAM schemes
employing more than four modes. In this case, the SNR gain achievable by AQAM is dB
at the average BEP of Pavg = 1.154×10−2. For the average throughputs of Bavg = 2, 4 and
6, the SNR gains of the 6-mode AQAM schemes over the fixed QAM schemes are dB
5.82dB and 5.12dB, respectively
Figure 22.9 shows the performance of the six-mode AQAM scheme, which is an extended
version of the five-mode AQAM of Section 22.7.2.1, for the peak instantaneous BEP values
of Pth = 10−1, 10−2, 10−3, 10−4 and 10−5. We can observe in Figure 22.9(a) that the corre
sponding average BER Pavg decreases as Pth decreases. The average throughput curves seen
in Figure 22.9(b) indicate that as anticipated the increased average SNR facilitates attaining
an increased throughput by the AQAM scheme and there is a clear design trade-off between
the achievable average throughput and the peak instantaneous BEP. This is because predom
inantly lower-throughput, but more error-resilient AQAM modes have to be activated, when
the target BER is low. By contrast, higher-throughput but more error-sensitive AQAM modes
are favoured, when the tolerable BEP is increased
In conclusion, we introduced an adaptive modulation scheme, where the objective is to
limit the peak instantaneous BEP. A set of switching levels designed for meeting this ob
jective was given in (22.38), which is independent of the underlying fading channel and
the average SNR. The corresponding average BEP and throughput formulae were derived

regarding the design of the AQAM switching levels, while its drawback is that there is no di
rect relationship between the peak instantaneous BEP and the average BEP, which was used
as our performance measure. In the next section a different switching-level optimization phi
losophy is introduced and contrasted with the approach of designing the switching levels for
maintaining a given peak instantaneous BEP
22.8.2 Torrance’s Switching Levels
Torrance and Hanzo [184] proposed the employment of the following cost function and ap
plied Powell’s optimization method [187] for generating the optimum switching levels
ΩT (s)
dB

dB
[10 log10(max{Pavg(γ̄; s)/Pth, 1}) + Bmax −Bavg(γ̄; s)] ,
where the average BEP Pavg is given in (22.21), γ̄ is the average SNR per symbol, s is the set
of switching levels, Pth is the target average BER, Bmax is the BPS throughput of the highest
order constituent modulation mode and the average throughput Bavg is given in (22.14). The
idea behind employing the cost function ΩT is that of maximizing the average throughput
Bavg , while endeavouring to maintain the target average BEP Pth. Following the philosophy
of Section 22.8.1, the minimization of the cost function of (22.39) produces a set of constant
switching levels across the entire SNR range. However, since the calculation of Pavg and
Bavg requires the knowledge of the PDF of the instantaneous SNR γ per symbol, in reality
the set of switching levels s required for maintaining a constant Pavg is dependent on the
channel encountered and the receiver structure used
Figure 22.10 illustrates the operation of a five-mode AQAM scheme employing Tor
rance’s SNR-independent switching levels designed for maintaining the target average BEP
of Pth = 10−2 over a flat Rayleigh channel. The average SNR was γ̄ = 10dB and the tar
get average BEP was Pth = 10−2. Powell’s minimization [187] involved in the context of
(22.39) provides the set of optimised switching levels, given by s1 = 2.367, s2 =
s3 = 15.050 and s4 = 56.522. Upon comparing Figure 22.10(a) to Figure 22.7(a) we find
that the two schemes are nearly identical in terms of activating the various AQAM modes
according to the channel envelope trace, while the peak instantaneous BEP associated with
Torrance’s switching scheme is not constant. This is in contrast to the constant peak instan
taneous BEP values seen in Figure 22.7(a). The mode selection probabilities depicted in
Figure 22.10(b) are similar to those seen in Figure b
The average BEP curves, depicted in Figure 22.11(a) show that Torrance’s switching
levels support the AQAM scheme in successfully maintaining the target average BEP of
Pth =
−2 over the average SNR range of 0dB to 20dB, when five or six modem modes
are employed by the AQAM scheme. Most of the AQAM studies found in the literature have
applied Torrance’s switching levels owing to the above mentioned good agreement between
the design target Pth and the actual BEP performance Pavg

ploying the set of switching levels derived by Torrance and Hanzo [184] for achieving
the target average BEP of Pth = 10−2. (a) The instantaneous channel SNR γ is repre
sented as a thick line at the top part of the graph, the associated instantaneous BEP pe
as a thin line at the middle, and the instantaneous BPS throughput b(γ) as a thick line at
the bottom. The average SNR is γ̄ = 10dB. (b) As the SNR increases, the higherorder
AQAM modes are selected more often
ing various numbers of AQAM modes to the average BPS throughput of fixed-mode QAM
arrangements achieving the same average BEP, i.e. Pe = Pavg , which is not necessarily
identical to the target BEP of Pe = Pth. Specifically, the SNR values required by the fixed
mode scheme in order to achieve Pe = Pavg are represented by the markers ‘⊗’, while the
SNRs, where the target average BEP of Pe = Pth is achieved, is denoted by the markers
Compared to the fixed QAM schemes achieving Pe = Pavg , the SNR gains of the AQAM
scheme were 9.06dB, 7.02dB, 5.81dB and 8.74dB for the BPS throughput values of 1, 2,
and 6, respectively. By contrast, the corresponding SNR gains compared to the fixed QAM
schemes achieving Pe = Pth were 7.55dB, 6.26dB, 5.83dB and 1.45dB. We can observe
that the SNR gain of the AQAM arrangement over the 64-QAM scheme achieving a BEP of
Pe = Pth is small compared to the SNR gains attained in comparison to the lowerthroughput
fixed-mode modems. This is due to the fact that the AQAM scheme employing Torrances
switching levels allows the target BEP to drop at a high average SNR due to its suboptimum
thresholds, which prevents the scheme from increasing the average throughput steadily to
the maximum achievable BPS throughput. This phenomenon is more visible for low target
average BERs, as it can be observed in Figure
In conclusion, we reviewed an adaptive modulation scheme employing Torrance’s switch
ing levels [184], where the objective was to maximize the average BPS throughput, while
maintaining the target average BEP. Torrance’s switching levels are constant across the entire
SNR range and the average BEP Pavg of the AQAM scheme employing these switching lev

BEP Pavg is close to the target BEP of Pth = 10−2 over an average SNR range which
becomes wider, as the number of modulation modes increases. However, the fivemode
and six-mode AQAM schemes have a similar performance across much of the SNR

average SNR values, namely for γ̄ > dB

22.8.3 Cost Function Optimization as a Function of the Average SNR
In the previous section, we investigated Torrance’s switching levels [184] designed for
achieving a certain target average BEP. However, the actual average BEP of the AQAM sys
tem was not constant across the SNR range, implying that the average throughput could
potentially be further increased. Hence here we propose a modified cost function Ω(s;
putting more emphasis on achieving a higher throughput and optimise the switching levels
for a given SNR, rather than for the whole SNR range
Ω(s; γ̄) = 10 log10(max{Pavg(γ̄; s)/Pth, 1}) + ρ log10(Bmax/Bavg(γ̄; s)) ,
where s is a set of switching levels, γ̄ is the average SNR per symbol, Pavg is the average
BEP of the adaptive modulation scheme given in (22.21), Pth is the target average BEP of
the adaptive modulation scheme, Bmax is the BPS throughput of the highest order constituent

Figure 22.12: The performance of the six-mode AQAM scheme employing Torrance’s switching lev
els [184] for various target average BERs. When the average SNR is over 25dB and the
target average BEP is low, the average BEP of the AQAM scheme begins to decrease
preventing the scheme from increasing the average BPS throughput steadily
modulation mode. Furthermore, the average throughput Bavg is given in (22.14) and ρ is a
weighting factor, facilitating the above-mentioned BPS throughput enhancement. The first
term at the right hand side of (22.40) corresponds to a cost function, which accounts for the
difference, in the logarithmic domain, between the average BEP Pavg of the AQAM scheme
and the target BEP Pth. This term becomes zero, when Pavg ≤ Pth, contributing no cost
to the overall cost function Ω. On the other hand, the second term of (22.40) accounts for
the logarithmic distance between the maximum achievable BPS throughput Bmax and the
average BPS throughput Bavg of the AQAM scheme, which decreases, as Bavg approaches
Bmax. Applying Powell’s minimization [187] to this cost function under the constraint of
sk−1 ≤ sk, the optimum set of switching levels sopt(γ̄) can be obtained, resulting in the
highest average BPS throughput, while maintaining the target average BEP
Figure 22.13 depicts the switching levels versus the average SNR per symbol optimised in
this manner for a five-mode AQAM scheme achieving the target average BEP of Pth =
and 10−3. Since the switching levels are optimised for each specific average SNR value, they
are not constant across the entire SNR range. As the average SNR γ̄ increases, the switching
levels decrease in order to activate the higher-order mode modulation modes more often in
an effort to increase the BPS throughput. The low-order modulation modes are abandoned
one by one, as γ̄ increases, activating always the highest-order modulation mode, namely
64-QAM, when the average BEP of the fixed-mode 64-QAM scheme becomes lower, than
the target average BEP Pth. Let us define the avalanche SNR γ̄α of a K-mode adaptive
modulation scheme as the lowest SNR, where the target BEP is achieved, which can be

Figure 22.13: The switching levels optimised at each average SNR value in order to achieve the tar

increases, the switching levels decrease in order to activate the higher-order mode mod
ulation modes more often in an effort to increase the BPS throughput. The loworder
modulation modes are abandoned one by one as γ̄ increases, activating the highestorder
modulation mode, namely 64-QAM, all the time when the average BEP of the fixed
mode 64-QAM scheme becomes lower than the target average BEP Pth
formulated as
Pe,mK (γ̄α) = Pth ,
where mK is the highest order modulation mode, Pe,mK is the average BEP of the fixed
mode mK-ary modem activated at the average SNR of γ̄ and Pth is the target average BEP
of the adaptive modulation scheme. We can observe in Figure 22.13 that when the average
channel SNR is higher than the avalanche SNR, i.e. γ̄ ≥ γ̄α, the switching levels are reduced
to zero. Some of the optimised switching level versus SNR curves exhibit glitches, indicating
that the multi-dimensional optimization might result in local optima in some cases
The corresponding average BEP Pavg and the average throughput Bavg of the two to six
mode AQAM schemes designed for the target average BEP of Pth = 10−2 are depicted in
Figure 22.14. We can observe in Figure 22.14(a) that now the actual average BEP Pavg of the
AQAM scheme is exactly the same as the target BEP of Pth = 10−2, when the average SNR
is less than or equal to the avalanche SNR γ̄α. As the number of AQAM modulation modes K
increases, the range of average SNRs where the design target of Pavg = Pth is met extends to
a higher SNR, namely to the avalanche SNR. In Figure 22.14(b), the average BPS throughputs
of the AQAM modems employing the ‘per-SNR optimised’ switching levels introduced in
this section are represented in thick lines, while the BPS throughput of the six-mode AQAM
arrangement employing Torrance’s switching levels [184] is represented using a solid thin

target average BEP of Pe,mK = Pth are represented by the markers  As we can observe in
Figure 22.14(b) the new per-SNR optimised scheme produces a higher BPS throughput, than
the scheme using Torrance’s switching regime, when the average SNR γ̄ > 20dB. However
for the range of 8dB < γ̄ < 20dB, the BPS throughput of the new scheme is lower than that
of Torrance’s scheme, indicating that the multi-dimensional optimization technique might
reach local minima for some SNR values
Figure 22.15(a) shows that the six-mode AQAM scheme employing ‘per-SNR optimised
switching levels satisfies the target average BEP values of Pth = 10−1 to 10−4. However, the
corresponding average throughput performance shown in Figure 22.15(b) also indicates that
the thresholds generated by the multi-dimensional optimization were not satisfactory. The
BPS throughput achieved was heavily dependent on the value of the weighting factor ρ in
(22.40). The glitches seen in the BPS throughput curves in Figure 22.15(b) also suggest that
the optimization process might result in some local minima
We conclude that due to these problems it is hard to achieve a satisfactory BPS throughput
for adaptive modulation schemes employing the switching levels optimised for each SNR
value based on the heuristic cost function of (22.40), while the corresponding average BEP
exhibits a perfect agreement with the target average BEP

of the highest-order fixed-mode QAM scheme, i.e. that of 256-QAM. (b) For some
SNR values the BPS throughput performance of the six-mode AQAM scheme is not
satisfactory due to the fact that the multi-dimensional optimization algorithm becomes
trapped in local minima and hence fails to reach the global minimum
22.8.4 Lagrangian Method
As argued in the previous section, Powell’s minimization [187] of the cost function often
leads to a local minimum, rather than to the global minimum. Hence, here we adopt an
analytical approach to finding the globally optimised switching levels. Our aim is to optimise
the set of switching levels, s, so that the average BPS throughput B(γ̄; s) can be maximized
under the constraint of Pavg(γ̄; s) = Pth. Let us define PR for a K-mode adaptive modula
tion scheme as the sum of the mode-specific average BEP weighted by the BPS throughput
of the individual constituent mode
PR(γ̄; s)
K

where γ̄ is the average SNR per symbol, s is the set of switching levels, K is the number of
constituent modulation modes, bk is the BPS throughput of the k-th constituent mode and the
mode-specific average BEP Pk is given in (22.20) as
Pk
∫ sk
sk
pmk(γ) f(γ) dγ ,
692 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
where again, pmk(γ) is the BEP of the mk-ary modulation scheme over the AWGN channel
and f(γ) is the PDF of the SNR per symbol γ. Explicitly, (22.43) implies weighting the BEP
pmk(γ) by its probability of occurrence quantified in terms of its PDF and then averaging
i.e. integrating it over the range spanning from sk to sk+1. Then, with the aid of (22.21), the
average BEP constraint can also be written as
Pavg(γ̄; s) = Pth ⇐⇒ PR(γ̄; s) = Pth B(γ̄; s) .
Another rational constraint regarding the switching levels can be expressed as
sk ≤ sk+1 .
As we discussed before, our optimization goal is to maximize the objective function
B(γ̄; s) under the constraint of (22.44). The set of switching levels s has K + 1 levels in
it. However, considering that we have s0 = 0 and sK = ∞ in many adaptive modulation
schemes, we have K − 1 independent variables in s. Hence, the optimization task is a K −
dimensional optimization under a constraint [675]. It is a standard practice to introduce a
modified object function using a Lagrangian multiplier and convert the problem into a set of
one-dimensional optimization problems. The modified object function Λ can be formulated
employing a Lagrangian multiplier λ [675] as
Λ(s; γ̄) = B(γ̄; s) + λ {PR(γ̄; s)− Pth B(γ̄; s)}
= (1− λPth)B(γ̄; s) + λPR(γ̄; s) .
The optimum set of switching levels should satisfy

s


s
(B(γ̄; s) + λ {PR(γ̄; s)− Pth B(γ̄; s)}) = 0 and
PR(γ̄; s)− Pt B(γ̄; s) = 0 .
The following results are helpful in evaluating the partial differentiations in (22.48)

where bk is the BPS throughput of an mk-ary modem. Since the average throughput is given

= −ck f(sk) ,
where ck was defined as ck , bk − bk−1 in Section 22.7.1. Hence (22.48) can be evaluated
as

−ck(1− λPth) +

bk−1 pmk−1(sk)− bkpmksk

f(sk) = 0 for k = 1, 2, · · · ,K − 1

A trivial solution of (22.55) is f(sk) = 0. Certainly, {sk =∞, k = 1, 2, · · · ,K−1} satisfies
this condition. Again, the lowest throughput modulation mode is ‘No-Tx’ in our model
which corresponds to no transmission. When the PDF of γ satisfies f(0) = 0, {sk = 0, k
1, 2, · · · ,K − 1} can also be a solution, which corresponds to the fixed-mode mKary
modem. The corresponding avalanche SNR γ̄α can obtained by substituting {sk = 0, k
1, 2, · · · ,K − 1} into (22.49), which satisfies
pmK−1(γ̄α)− Pth = 0 .
When f(sk) 6= 0, Equation (22.55) can be simplified upon dividing both sides by fsk
yielding
−ck(1− λPth) +

bk−1 pmk−1(sk)− bkpmksk

= 0 for k = 1, 2, · · · ,K − 1

Rearranging (22.57) for k = 1 and assuming c1 6= 0, we have
1− λPth

c
{b0 pm0(s1)− b1pm1(s1)} .
Substituting (22.58) into (22.57) and assuming ck 6= 0 for k 6= 0, we have

c
{b0 pm0(s1)− b1pm1(s1)} .
In this context we note that the Lagrangian multiplier λ is not zero because substitution of
λ = 0 in (22.57) leads to−ck = 0, which is not true. Hence, we can eliminate the Lagrangian
multiplier dividing both sides of (22.59) by λ. Then we have
yk(sk) = y1(s1) for k = 2, 3, · · · K − 1 ,
where the function yk(sk) is defined as

which does not contain the Lagrangian multiplier λ and hence it will be referred to as the
‘Lagrangian-free function’. This function can be physically interpreted as the normalized

BEP difference between the adjacent AQAM modes. For example, y1(s1) = p2(s1) quan
tifies the BEP increase, when switching from the No-Tx mode to the BPSK mode, while
y2(s2) = 2 p4(s2) − p2(s2) indicates the BEP difference between the QPSK and BPSK
modes. These curve will be more explicitly discussed in the context of Figure 22.16. The
significance of (22.60) is that the relationship between the optimum switching levels sk
where k = 2, 3, · · · K − 1, and the lowest optimum switching level s1 is independent of the
underlying propagation scenario. Only the constituent modulation mode related parameters
such as bk, ck and pmk(γ), govern this relationship
Let us now investigate some properties of the Lagrangian-free function yk(sk) given in
(22.61). Considering that bk > bk−1 and pmk(sk) > pmk−1(sk), it is readily seen that the
value of yk(sk) is always positive. When sk = 0, yk(sk) becomes
yk(0)

The solution of yk(sk) = 1/2 can be either sk = 0 or bkpmk(sk) = bk−1pmk−1(sk). When
sk = 0, yk(sk) becomes yk(∞) = 0. We also conjecture that

which states that the k-th optimum switching level sk always increases, whenever the lowest
optimum switching level s1 increases. Our numerical evaluations suggest that this conjecture
appears to be true
As an example, let us consider the five-mode AQAM scheme introduced in Sec
tion 22.7.2.1. The parameters of the five-mode AQAM scheme are summarised in Table
Substituting these parameters into (22.60) and (22.61), we have the following set of equations
y1(s1) = p2(s1)
y2(s2) = 2 p4(s2)− p2(s2)
y3(s3) = 2 p16(s3)− p4(s3)
y4(s4) = 3 p64(s4)− 2 p16(s4)
The Lagrangian-free functions of (22.64) through (22.67) are depicted in Figure 22.16 for
Gray-mapped square-shaped QAM. As these functions are basically linear combinations of
BEP curves associated with AWGN channels, they exhibit waterfall-like shapes and asymp
totically approach 0.5, as the switching levels sk approach zero (or −∞ expressed in dB
While y1(s1) and y2(s2) are monotonic functions, y3(s3) and y4(s4) cross the y = 0.5 line at
s3 = −7.34 dB and s4 = 1.82 dB respectively, as it can be observed in Figure 22.16(b). One
should also notice that the trivial solutions of (22.60) are yk = 0.5 at sk = 0, k = 1, 2, 3,
as we have discussed before
For a given value of s1, the other switching levels can be determined as s2 = y

proaches 0.5. Observe that while y1(s1) and y2(s2) are monotonic functions, ys
and y4(s4) cross the y = 0.5 line
line across the corresponding point. From the crossover points found on the curves of y2, y
and y4 with the aid of the horizontal line, we can find the corresponding values of the other
switching levels, namely those of α2, α3 and α4. In a numerical sense, this solution cor
responds to a one-dimensional (1-D) root finding problem [187] (Chapter 9). Furthermore
the yk(sk) values are monotonic, provided that we have yk(sk) < 0.5 and this implies that
the roots found are unique. The numerical results shown in Figure 22.17 represent the direct
relationship between the optimum switching level s1 and the other optimum switching lev
els, namely s2, s3 and s4. While the optimum value of s2 shows a near-linear relationship
with respect to s1, those of s3 and s4 asymptotically approach two different constants, as
s1 becomes smaller. This corroborates the trends observed in Figure 22.16(b), where ys
and y4(s4) cross the y = 0.5 line at s3 = −7.34 dB and s4 = 1.82 dB, respectively. Since
the low-order modulation modes are abandoned at high average channel SNRs in order to
increase the average throughput, the high values of s1 on the horizontal axis of Figure
indicate encountering a low channel SNR, while low values of s1 suggest that high channel
SNRs are experienced, as it transpires for example from Figure
Since we can relate the other switching levels to s1, we have to determine the optimum
value of s1 for the given target BEP, Pth, and the PDF of the instantaneous channel SNR
f(γ), by solving the constraint equation given in (22.49). This problem also constitutes a
1-D root finding problem, rather than a multi-dimensional optimization problem, which was
the case in Sections 22.8.2 and 22.8.3. Let us define the constraint function Y (γ̄; s(s1)) using

Y (γ̄; s(s1)) , PR(γ̄; s(s1))− Pth B(γ̄; s(s1)),
where we represented the set of switching levels as a vector, which is the function of s1, in
order to emphasise that sk satisfies the relationships given by (22.60) and
More explicitly, Y (γ̄; s(s1)) of (22.68) can be physically interpreted as the difference
between PR(γ̄; s(s1)), namely the sum of the mode-specific average BEPs weighted by the
BPS throughput of the individual AQAM modes, as defined in (22.42) and the average BPS
throughput B(γ̄; s(s1)) weighted by the target BEP Pth. Considering the equivalence re
lationship given in (22.44), (22.68) reflects just another way of expressing the difference
between the average BEP Pavg of the adaptive scheme and the target BEP Pth
Even though the relationships implied in s(s1) are independent of the propagation con
ditions and the signalling power, the constraint function Y (γ̄; s(s1)) of (22.68) and hence
the actual values of the optimum switching levels are dependent on propagation conditions
through the PDF f(γ) of the SNR per symbol and on the average SNR per symbol
Let us find the initial value of Y (γ̄; s(s1)) defined in (22.68), when s1 = 0. An obvious
solution for sk when s1 = 0 is sk = 0 for k = 1, 2, · · · ,K − 1. In this case, Y (γ̄; ss
becomes
Y (γ̄; 0) = bK−1 (PmK−1(γ̄)− Pth),
where bK−1 is the BPS throughput of the highest-order constituent modulation mode, while
PmK−1(γ̄) is the average BEP of the highest-order constituent modulation mode for trans
mission over the underlying channel scenario and Pth is the target average BEP. The value of
Y (γ̄; 0) could be positive or negative, depending on the average SNR γ̄ and on the target aver
age BEP Pth. Another solution exists for sk when s1 = 0, if bk pmk(sk) = bk−1 pmksk
22.8. OPTIMUM SWITCHING LEVELS
The value of Y (γ̄; 0+) using this alternative solution turns out to be close to Y (γ̄; 0). How
ever, in the actual numerical evaluation of the initial value of Y , we should use Y (γ̄; 0+) for
ensuring the continuity of the function Y at s1 =
In order to find the minima and the maxima of Y , we have to evaluate the derivative of
Y (γ̄; s(s1)) with respect to s1. With the aid of (22.50) to (22.54), we have

Considering f(sk) ≥ 0 and using our conjecture that dskds1 > 0 given in (22.63), we can
conclude from (22.70) that dYds1 = 0 has roots, when f(sk) = 0 for all k or when b1 pms
b0 pm0(s1) = Pth. The former condition corresponds to either si = 0 for some PDF f(γ) or
to sk =∞ for all PDFs. By contrast, when the condition of b1 pm1(s1)−b0 pm0(s1) = Pth is
met, dY/ds1 = 0 has a unique solution. Investigating the sign of the first derivative between
these zeros, we can conclude that Y (γ̄; s1) has a global minimum of Ymin at s1 = ζ such
that b1 pm1(ζ)− b0 pm0(ζ) = Pth and a maximum of Ymax at s1 = 0 and another maximum
value at s1
Since Y (γ̄; s1) has a maximum value at s1 = ∞, let us find the corresponding maxi
mum value. Let us first consider lims1→∞ Pavg(γ̄; s(s1)), where upon exploiting

employing Gray-mapped square-constellation QAM operating over a flat Rayleigh fad

value, while approaching 0−, as s1 increases. The solution of Y (γ̄; s(s1)) = 0 exists
when Y (γ̄; 0) = 6{p64(γ̄) − Pth} > 0 and is unique
implying that Pavg(γ̄; sk) approaches zero from positive values, when s1 tends to∞. Since

From the analysis of the minimum and the maxima, we can conclude that the constraint
function Y (γ̄; s(s1)) defined in (22.68) has a unique zero only if Y (γ̄; 0+) > 0 at a switching
value of 0 < s1 < ζ, where ζ satisfies b1 pm1(ζ) − b0 pm0(ζ) = Pth. By contrast, when
Y (γ̄; 0+) < 0, the optimum switching levels are all zero and the adaptive modulation scheme
always employs the highest-order constituent modulation mode
As an example, let us evaluate the constraint function Y (γ̄; s1) for our five-mode AQAM
scheme operating over a flat Rayleigh fading channel. Figure 22.18 depicts the values of
Y (s1) for several values of the target average BEP Pth, when the average channel SNR is
30dB. We can observe that Y (s1) = 0 may have a root, depending on the target BEP Pth

When sk = 0 for k < 5, according to (22.21), (22.42) and (22.68) Y (s1) is reduced to
Y (γ̄; 0) = 6(P64(γ̄)− Pth) ,
where P64(γ̄) is the average BEP of 64-QAM over a flat Rayleigh channel. The value of
Y (γ̄; 0) in (22.79) can be negative or positive, depending on the target BEP Pth
We can observe in Figure 22.18 that the solution of Y (γ̄; s(s1)) = 0 is unique, when it ex
ists. The locus of the minimum Y (s1), i.e. the trace curve of points (Ymin(s1,min), smin
where Y has the minimum value, is also depicted in Figure 22.18. The locus is always below
the horizontal line of Y (s1) = 0 and asymptotically approaches this line, as the target BEP
Pth becomes smaller
Figure 22.19 depicts the switching levels optimised in this manner for our fivemode
AQAM scheme maintaining the target average BEPs of Pth = 10−2 and 10−3. The switching
levels obtained using Powell’s optimization method in Section 22.8.3 are represented as the
thin grey lines in Figure 22.19 for comparison. In this case all the modulation modes may
be activated with a certain probability, until the average SNR reaches the avalanche SNR
value, while the scheme derived using Powell’s optimization technique abandons the lower
throughput modulation modes one by one, as the average SNR increases
Figure 22.20 depicts the average throughput B expressed in BPS of the AQAM scheme
employing the switching levels optimised using the Lagrangian method. In Figure a

cussed in Section 22.8.2 is represented as a thin grey line. The Lagrangian multiplier based

responding BPS throughput of the AQAM scheme employing per-SNR optimised thresholds
determined using Powell’s method are also represented as thin lines for Pth = 10−1,
and 10−3. Comparing the BPS throughput curves, we can conclude that the per-SNR opti
mised Powell method of Section 22.8.3 resulted in imperfect optimization for some values of
the average SNR
In conclusion, we derived an optimum mode-switching regime for a general AQAM
scheme using the Lagrangian multiplier method and presented our numerical results for var
ious AQAM arrangements. Since the results showed that the Lagrangian optimization based
scheme is superior in comparison to the other methods investigated, we will employ these
switching levels in order to further investigate the performance of various adaptive modula
tion schemes
22.9 Results and Discussions
The average throughput performance of adaptive modulation schemes employing the globally
optimised mode-switching levels of Section 22.8.4 is presented in this section. The mobile

channel is modelled as a Nakagami-m fading channel. The performance results and discus
sions include the effects of the fading parameter m, that of the number of modulation modes
the influence of the various diversity schemes used and the range of Square QAM, Star QAM
and MPSK signalling constellations
22.9.1 Narrow-Band Nakagami-m Fading Channel
The PDF of the instantaneous channel SNR γ of a system transmitting over the Nakagami
fading channel is given in (22.22). The parameters characterising the operation of the adaptive
modulation scheme were summarised in Section
22.9.1.1 Adaptive PSK Modulation Schemes
Phase Shift Keying (PSK) has the advantage of exhibiting a constant envelope power, since
all the constellation points are located on a circle. Let us first consider the BEP of fixedmode
PSK schemes as a reference, so that we can compare the performance of adaptive PSK and
fixed-mode PSK schemes. The BEP of Gray-coded coherent M -ary PSK (MPSK), where
M = 2k, for transmission over the AWGN channel can be closely approximated by

Figure 22.21(a) shows the BEP of BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16PSK, 32PSK and 64PSK for
transmission over the AWGN channel. The differences of the required SNR per symbol
in order to achieve the BER of pMPSK(γ) = 10−6 for the modulation modes having a
throughput difference of 1 BPS are around 6dB, except between BPSK and QPSK, where a
3dB difference is observed

a flat Rayleigh channel, where m = 1. The BEP of MPSK over the AWGN channel given

performance of adaptive PSK schemes
The parameters of our nine-mode adaptive PSK scheme are summarised in Table
following the definitions of our generic model used for the adaptive modulation schemes de
veloped in Section 22.7.1. The models of other adaptive PSK schemes employing a different
number of modes can be readily obtained by increasing or reducing the number of columns in

Figure 22.22: ‘Lagrangian-free’ functions of (22.61) for a nine-mode adaptive PSK scheme. For a
given value of s1, there exist two solutions for sk satisfying yk(sk) = y1(s1). However
only the higher value of sk satisfies the constraint of sk−1 ≤ sk, ∀ k
s9 = ∞. In order to evaluate the performance of the nine-mode adaptive PSK scheme, we
have to obtain the optimum switching levels first. Let us evaluate the ‘Lagrangian-free’ func
tions defined in (22.61), using the parameters given in Table 22.5 and the BEP expressions
given in (22.80). The ‘Lagrangian-free’ functions of our nine-mode adaptive PSK scheme
are depicted in Figure 22.22. We can observe that there exist two solutions for sk satis
fying yk(sk) = y1(s1) for a given value of s1, which are given by the crossover points
over the horizontal lines at the various coordinate values scaled on the vertical axis. How
ever, only the higher value of sk satisfies the constraint of sk−1 ≤ sk, ∀ k. The enlarged
view near yk(sk) = 0.5 seen in Figure 22.22(b) reveals that y4(s4) may have no solution of
y4(s4) = y1(s1), when y1(s1) > 0.45. One option is to use a constant value of s4 = dB
where y4(s4) reaches its peak value. The other option is to set s4 = s3, effectively elim
inating 16PSK from the set of possible modulation modes. It was found that both policies
result in the same performance up to four effective decimal digits in terms of the average BPS
throughput
Upon solving yk(sk) = y1(s1), we arrive at the relationships sought between the first
optimum switching level s1 and the remaining optimum switching levels sk. Figure a
depicts these relationships. All the optimum switching levels, except for s1 and s2, approach
their asymptotic limit monotonically, as s1 decreases. A decreased value of s1 corresponds
to an increased value of the average SNR. Figure 22.23(b) illustrates the optimum switching
levels of a seven-mode adaptive PSK scheme operating over a Rayleigh channel associated
with m = 1 at the target BEP of Pth = 10−2. These switching levels were obtained by
solving (22.68). The optimum switching levels show a steady decrease in their values as the
average SNR increases, until it reaches the avalanche SNR value of γ̄ = 35dB, beyond which
always the highest-order PSK modulation mode, namely 64PSK, is activated

Having highlighted the evaluation of the optimum switching levels for an adaptive PSK
scheme, let us now consider the associated performance results. We are reminded that the
average BEP of our optimised adaptive scheme remains constant at Pavg = Pth, provided
that the average SNR is less than the avalanche SNR. Hence, the average BPS throughput and
the relative SNR gain of our APSK scheme in comparison to the corresponding fixedmode
modem are our concern
Let us now consider Figure 22.24, where the average BPS throughput of the various
adaptive PSK schemes operating over a Rayleigh channel associated with m = 1 are plotted
which were designed for the target BEP of Pth = 10−2 and Pth = 10−3. The markers
and  represent the required SNR of the various fixed-mode PSK schemes, while achiev
ing the same target BER as the adaptive schemes, operating over an AWGN channel and a
Rayleigh channel, respectively. It can be observed that introducing an additional constituent
mode into an adaptive PSK scheme does not make any impact on the average BPS through
put, when the average SNR is relatively low. For example, when the average SNR γ̄ is
less than 10dB in Figure 22.24(a), employing more than four APSK modes for the adaptive
scheme does not improve the average BPS throughput. In comparison to the various fixed
mode PSK modems, the adaptive modem achieved the SNR gains between 4dB and 8dB for
the target BEP of Pth = 10−2 and 10dB to 16dB for the target BEP of Pth = 10−3 over a
Rayleigh channel. Since no adaptive scheme operating over a fading channel can outperform
the corresponding fixed-mode counterpart operating over an AWGN channel, it is interesting
to investigate the performance differences between these two schemes. Figure 22.24 suggests
that the required SNR of our adaptive PSK modem achieving 1BPS for transmission over a
Rayleigh channel is approximately 1dB higher, than that of fixed-mode BPSK operating over

while achieving the same target BEP as the adaptive schemes, operating over an AWGN

only three modes, namely No-Tx, BPSK and QPSK for the adaptive PSK modem. For other
BPS throughput values, the corresponding SNR differences are in the range of 2dB to dB
while maintaining the BEP of Pth = 10−2 and 4dB for the BEP of Pth =
We observed in Figure 22.24 that the average BPS throughput of the various adaptive
PSK schemes is dependent on the target BEP. Hence, let us investigate the BPS performances
of the adaptive modems for the various values of target BEPs using the results depicted in
Figure 22.25. The average BPS throughputs of a nine-mode adaptive PSK scheme are repre
sented as various types of lines without markers depending on the target average BERs, while
those of the corresponding fixed PSK schemes are represented as various types of lines with
markers according to the key legend shown in Figure 22.25. We can observe that the differ
ence between the required SNRs of the adaptive schemes and fixed schemes increases, as the
target BEP decreases. It is interesting to note that the average BPS curves of the adaptive PSK
schemes seem to converge to a set of densely packed curves, as the target BEP decreases to
values around 10−4 − 10−6. In other words, the incremental SNR required for achieving the
next target BEP, which is an order of magnitude lower, decreases as the target BEP decreases
On the other hand, the incremental SNR for the same scenario of fixed modems seems to
remain nearly constant at 10dB. Comparing Figure 22.25(a) and Figure 22.25(b), we find
that this seemingly constant incremental SNR of the fixed-mode modems is reduced to about
5dB, as the fading becomes less severe, i.e. when the fading parameter becomes m =
Let us now investigate the effects of the Nakagami fading parameter m on the average
BPS throughput performance of various adaptive PSK schemes by observing Figure

and (b) Pth = 10−6. The performance advantage of employing adaptive PSK schemes
decreases, as the fading becomes less severe
The BPS throughput of the various fixed PSK schemes for transmission over an AWGN chan
nel is depicted in Figure 22.26 as the ultimate performance limit achievable by the adaptive
schemes operating over Nakagami fading channels. For example, when the channel exhibits
Rayleigh fading, i.e. when the fading parameter becomes m = 1, the adaptive PSK schemes
show 3dB to 4dB SNR penalty compared to their fixed-mode counterparts operating over the
AWGN channel. Compared to fixed-mode BPSK, the adaptive scheme required only a dB
higher SNR. As the fading becomes less severe, the average BPS throughput of the adaptive
PSK schemes approaches that of fixed-mode PSK operating over the AWGN channel. For
the target BEP of Pth = 10−3, the SNR gap between the BPS throughput curves becomes
higher. The adaptive PSK scheme operating over the Rayleigh channel required 4dB to dB
higher SNR for achieving the same throughput compared to the fixed PSK schemes operating
over the AWGN channel
Figure 22.27 summarises the relative SNR gains of our adaptive PSK schemes over the
corresponding fixed PSK schemes. For the target BEP of Pth = 10−3 the relative SNR
gain of the nine-mode adaptive scheme compared to BPSK changes from 15.5dB to dB
as the Nakagami fading parameter changes from 1 to 6. Observing Figure 22.27(a) and
Figure 22.27(b) we conclude that the advantages of employing adaptive PSK schemes are
more pronounced when
1) the fading is more severe
2) the target BEP is lower, and
3) the average BPS throughput is lower

Figure 22.28: The average BEP of various SQAM modulation schemes
Having studied the range of APSK schemes, let us in the next section consider the family
of adaptive coherently detected Star-QAM schemes
22.9.1.2 Adaptive Coherent Star QAM Schemes
In this section, we study the performance of adaptive coherent QAM schemes employing
Type-I Star constellations [179]. Even though non-coherent Star QAM (SQAM) schemes
are more popular owing to their robustness to fading without requiring pilot symbol assisted
channel estimation and Automatic Gain Control (AGC) at the receiver, the results provided
in this section can serve as benchmark results for non-coherent Star QAM schemes and the
coherent Square QAM schemes
The BEP of coherent Star QAM over an AWGN channel is derived in Appendix 31.1. It
is shown that their BEP can be expressed as
pSQAM (γ)

where Ai and ai are given in Appendix 31.1 for 8-Star, 16-Star, 32-Star and 64-Star QAM
The SNR-dependent optimum ring ratios were also derived in Appendix 31.1 for these Star
QAM modems. Figure 22.28(a) shows the BEP of BPSK, QPSK, 8-Star QAM, Star
QAM, 32-Star QAM and 64-Star QAM employing the optimum ring ratios over the AWGN
channel. Comparing Figure 22.21(a) and Figure 22.28(a), we can observe that 16-Star QAM
32-Star QAM and 64-Star QAM are more power-efficient than 16 PSK, 32 PSK and 64 PSK
respectively. However, the envelope power of the Star QAM signals is not constant, unlike
that of the PSK signals. Following an approach similar to that used in (22.84) and
the average BEP of the various SQAM schemes over a flat Nakagami-m fading channel can

Figure 22.28(b) shows the average BEP of various SQAM schemes for transmission over a

QAM schemes exhibit SNR advantages of around 3.5dB, 4dB, and 7dB compared to PSK
32-PSK and 64-PSK schemes at a BEP of 10−2. The BEP of SQAM for transmission over
the AWGN channel given in (22.87) and that over a Nakagami channel given in (22.88) will

Table 22.6: Parameters of a seven-mode adaptive Star QAM scheme following the definitions devel

The parameters of a seven-mode adaptive Star QAM scheme are summarised in Ta
ble 22.6 following the definitions of the generic model developed in Section 22.7.1 for adap
tive modulation schemes. Since the number of modes is K = 7, we have K + 1 =
mode-switching levels hosted by the vector s = {sk | k = 0, 1, 2, · · · , 7}. Let us assume
that s0 = 0 and s7 = ∞. Then, we have to determine the optimum values for the remaining
six switching levels using the technique developed in Section 22.8.4. The Lagrangianfree
functions corresponding to a seven-mode Star QAM scheme are depicted in Figure
and the relationships obtained for the switching levels are displayed in Figure 22.30(a). We
can observe that as seen for APSK in Figure 22.22 there exist two solutions for s6 satisfying
y6(s6) = y1(s1) for a given value of s1, when y1 ≤ 0.382. However, only the higher value
of sk satisfies the constraint of s6 ≥ s5. When s1 ≤ 7.9dB, the optimum value of s6 should
be set to s5, in order to guarantee s6 ≥ s5. Figure 22.30(b) illustrates the optimum switch
ing levels of a seven-mode adaptive Star QAM scheme operating over a Rayleigh channel
at the target BEP of Pth = 10−2. These switching levels were obtained by solving
The optimum switching levels show a steady decrease in their values, as the average SNR
increases, until they reach the avalanche SNR value of γ̄ = 28.5dB, beyond which always
the highest-order modulation mode, namely 64-Star QAM, is activated
Let us now investigate the associated performance results. We are reminded that the
average BEP of our optimised adaptive scheme remains constant at Pavg = Pth, provided

corresponding fixed-mode Star QAM schemes, while achieving the same target BEP
as the adaptive schemes, operating over an AWGN channel and a Rayleigh channel
respectively
that the average SNR is less than the avalanche SNR. Hence, the average BPS throughput
and the SNR gain of our adaptive modem in comparison to the corresponding fixedmode
modems are our concern
Let us first consider Figure 22.31, where the average BPS throughput of the various adap
tive Star QAM schemes operating over a Rayleigh channel associated with m = 1 is shown
at the target BEP of Pth = 10−2 and Pth = 10−3. The markers ‘⊗’ and  represent the re
quired SNR of the corresponding fixed-mode Star QAM schemes, while achieving the same
target BEP as the adaptive schemes, operating over an AWGN channel and a Rayleigh chan
nel, respectively. Comparing Figure 22.24(a) and Figure 22.31(a), we find that the tangent
of the average BPS curves of the adaptive Star QAM schemes is higher than that of adap
tive PSK schemes. Explicitly, the tangent of the Star QAM schemes is around BPSdB
whereas that of the APSK schemes was 0.18BPS/dB. This is due to the more powerefficient
constellation arrangement of Star QAM in comparison to the single-ring constellations of
the PSK modulations schemes. In comparison to the corresponding fixed-mode Star QAM
modems, the adaptive modem achieved an SNR gain of 6dB to 8dB for the target BEP of
Pth =
−2 and 12dB to 16dB for the target BEP of Pth = 10−3 over a Rayleigh chan
nel. Compared to the fixed-mode Star QAM schemes operating over an AWGN channel, our
adaptive schemes approached their performance within about 3dB in terms of the required
SNR value, while achieving the same target BEP of Pth = 10−2 and Pth =
Since Figure 22.31 suggests that the relative SNR gain of the adaptive schemes is de
pendent on the target BER, let us investigate the effects of the target BEP in more detail

Figure 22.32: The average BPS throughput of a seven-mode adaptive Star QAM scheme operating
over a Nakagami fading channel (a) m = 1 and (b) m = 2. The markers represent the
SNR required by the fixed-mode schemes for achieving the same BPS throughput and
the same average BER as the adaptive schemes
Figure 22.32 shows the BPS throughput of the various adaptive schemes at the target BEP
of Pth = 10−2 to Pth = 10−6. The average BPS throughput of a seven-mode adaptive
Star QAM scheme is represented with the aid of the various line types without markers, de
pending on the target average BERs, while those of the corresponding fixed-mode Star QAM
schemes are represented as various types of lines having markers according to the legends
shown in Figure 22.32. We can observe that the difference between the SNRs required for
the adaptive schemes and fixed schemes increases, as the target BEP decreases. The fixed
mode Star QAM schemes require additional SNRs of 10dB and 6dB in order to achieve an
order of magnitude lower BEP for the Nakagami fading parameters of m = 1 and m =
respectively. However, our adaptive schemes require additional SNRs of only 1dB to 3dB for
achieving the same goal
Let us now investigate the effects of the Nakagami fading parameter m on the average
BPS throughput performance of the various adaptive Star QAM schemes by observing Fig
ure 22.33. The BPS throughput of the fixed-mode Star QAM schemes for the transmission
over an AWGN channel is depicted in Figure 22.33 as the ultimate performance limit achiev
able by the adaptive schemes operating over Nakagami fading channels. As the Nakagami
fading parameter m increases from 1 to 2 and to 6, the SNR gap between the adaptive schemes
operating over a Nakagami fading channel and the fixed-mode schemes decreases. When the
average SNR is less than γ̄ ≤ 6dB, the average BPS throughput of our adaptive schemes de
creases, when the fading parameter m increases. The rationale of this phenomenon is that as
the channel becomes more and more like an AWGN channel, the probability of activating the
BPSK mode is reduced, resulting in more frequent activation of the No-Tx mode and hence
the corresponding average BPS throughput inevitably decreases

714 CHAPTER 22. ADAPTIVE QAM OPTIMISATION FOR OFDM AND MCCDMA
The effects of the Nakagami fading factor m on the SNR gain of our adaptive Star QAM
scheme can be observed in Figure 22.34. As expected, the relative SNR gain of the adaptive
schemes at a throughput of 1 BPS is the highest among the BPS throughputs considered
However, the order observed in terms of the SNR gain of the adaptive schemes does not
strictly follow the increasing BPS order at the target BEP of Pth = 10−3 and Pth =
as it did for the adaptive PSK schemes of Section 22.9.1.1. Even though the adaptive Star
QAM schemes exhibit a higher throughput, than the adaptive PSK schemes, the SNR gains
compared to their fixed-mode counterparts are more or less the same, showing typically less
than 1dB difference, except for the 5 BPS throughput scenario, where the adaptive QAM
scheme gained up to 1.3dB more in terms of the required SNR than the adaptive PSK scheme
Having studied the performance of a range of adaptive Star QAM schemes, in the next
section we consider adaptive modulation schemes employing the family of squareshaped
QAM constellations
22.9.1.3 Adaptive Coherent Square QAM Modulation Schemes
Since coherent Square M -ary QAM (MQAM) is the most power-efficient M -ary modulation
scheme [179] and the accurate channel estimation becomes possible with the advent of Pilot
Symbol Assisted Modulation (PSAM) techniques [138, 139, 177], Otsuki, Sampei and Mori
naga proposed to employ coherent square QAM as the constituent modulation modes for an
adaptive modulation scheme [178] instead of non-coherent Star QAM modulation [176]. In
this section, we study the various aspects of this adaptive square QAM scheme employing
the optimum switching levels of Section 22.8.4. The closed form BEP expressions of square
QAM over an AWGN channel can be found in (22.2) and that over a Nakagami channel can
be expressed using a similar form given in (22.88). The optimum switching levels of adaptive
Square QAM were studied in Section 22.8.4 as an example
The average BEP of our six-mode adaptive Square QAM scheme operating over a flat
Rayleigh fading channel is depicted in Figure 22.35(a), which shows that the modem main
tains the required constant target BER, until it reaches the BER curve of the specific fixed
mode modulation scheme employing the highest-order modulation mode, namely QAM
and then it follows the BEP curve of the 256-QAM mode. The various grey lines in the fig
ure represent the BEP of the fixed constituent modulation modes for transmission over a flat
Rayleigh fading channel. An arbitrarily low target BEP could be maintained at the expense
of a reduced throughput
The average throughput is shown in Figure 22.35(b) together with the estimated channel
capacity of the narrow-band Rayleigh channel [180, 181] and with the throughput of sev
eral variable-power, variable-rate modems reported in [183]. Specifically, Goldsmith and
Chua [183] studied the performance of their variable-power variable-rate adaptive modems
based on a BER bound of m-ary Square QAM, rather than using an exact BER expression
Since our adaptive Square QAM schemes do not vary the transmission power, our scheme
can be regarded as a sub-optimal policy viewed for their respective [183]. However, the
throughput performance of Figure 22.35(b) shows that the SNR degradation is within dB
in the low-SNR region and within half a dB in the high-SNR region, in comparison to the
ideal continuously variable-power adaptive QAM scheme employing a range of hypotheti
cal continuously variable-BPS QAM modes [183], represented as the ‘Goldsmith 1’ scheme
in the figure. Goldsmith and Chua [183] also reported the performance of a variablepower

QAM scheme operating over a flat Rayleigh channel (m = 1). (a) The constant tar
get average BEP is maintained over the entire range of the average SNR values up to
the avalanche SNR. (b) The average BPS throughput of the equivalent constantpower
adaptive scheme is compared to Goldsmith’s schemes [183]. The ‘Goldsmith 1’ and
‘Goldsmith 2’ schemes represent a variable-power adaptive scheme employing hypo
thetical continuously variable-BPS QAM modulation modes and Square QAM modes
respectively. The ‘Goldsmith 3’ scheme represents the simulation results associated with
a constant-power adaptive Square QAM reported in
discrete-rate and a constant-power discrete-rate scheme, which we represented as the Gold
smith 2’ and ‘Goldsmith 3’ scenarios in Figure 22.35(b), respectively. Since their results are
based on approximate BER formulas, the average BPS throughput performance of the Gold
smith 3’ scheme is optimistic, when the average SNR γ is less than 17dB. Considering that
our scheme achieves the maximum possible throughput the given average SNR value with
the aid of the globally optimised switching levels, the average throughput of the Goldsmith
3’ scheme is expected to be lower, than that of our scheme, as is the case when the average
SNR γ is higher than dB
Figure 22.36(a) depicts the average BPS throughput of our various adaptive Square QAM
schemes operating over a Rayleigh channel associated with m = 1 at the target BEP of Pth
10−3. Figure 22.36(a) shows that even though the constituent modulation modes of our
adaptive schemes do not include 3, 5 and 7-BPS constellations, the average BPS throughput
steadily increases without undulations. Compared to the fixed-mode Square QAM schemes
operating over an AWGN channel, our adaptive schemes require additional SNRs of less
than 3.5dB, when the throughput is below 6.5 BPS. The comparison of the average BPS
throughputs of the adaptive schemes employing PSK, Star QAM and Square QAM modems
as depicted in Figure 22.36(b), confirms the superiority of Square QAM over the other two
schemes in terms of the required average SNR for achieving the same throughput and the

and the third constituent modulation modes, their throughput performance shows virtually no
difference, when the average throughput is less than or equal to Bavg = 2 BPS
Let us now investigate the effects of the Nakagami fading parameter m on the average
BPS throughput performance of the adaptive Square QAM schemes observing Figure
The BPS throughput of the fixed-mode Square QAM schemes over an AWGN channel is de
picted in Figure 22.37 as the ultimate performance limit achievable by the adaptive schemes
operating over Nakagami fading channels. Similar observations can be made for the adaptive
Square QAM scheme, like for the adaptive Star QAM arrangement characterized in Fig
ure 22.33. A specific difference is, however, that the average BPS throughput recorded for
the fading parameter of m = 6 exhibits an undulating curve. For example, an increased m
value results in a limited improvement of the corresponding average BPS throughput near
the throughput values of 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 BPS. This is because our adaptive Square QAM
schemes do not use 3-, 5- and 7-BPS constituent modems, unlike the adaptive PSK and adap
tive Star QAM schemes. Figure 22.38 depicts the corresponding optimum modeswitching
levels for the six-mode adaptive Square QAM scheme. The black lines represent the switch

general, the lower the switching levels, the higher the average BPS throughput of the adap
tive modems. When the Nakagami fading parameter is m = 1, the switching levels decrease
monotonically, as the average SNR increases. However, when the fading severity parameter is

Figure 22.39: The mode selection probability of a six-mode adaptive Square QAM scheme operating
over Nakagami fading channels at the target BEP of Pth = 10−2. When the fading
becomes less severe, the mode selection scheme becomes more ‘selective’ in comparison
to that for m =
m = 6, the switching levels fluctuate, exhibiting several local minima around 8dB, 15dB and
21dB. In the extreme case of m→ ∞, i.e. when operating over an AWGN-like channel, the
switching levels would be s1 = s2 = 0 and sk = ∞ for other k values in the SNR range of
7.3dB < γ̄ < 14dB, s1 = s2 = s3 = 0 and s4 = s5 =∞ when we have 14dB < γ̄ < dB
sk = 0 except for s5 = ∞ when the SNR is in the range of 20dB < γ̄ < 25dB and fi
nally, all sk = 0 for ∀k, when γ̄ > 25dB, when considering the fixed-mode Square QAM
performance achieved over an AWGN channel represented by markers  in Figure
Observing Figure 22.39, we find that our adaptive schemes become highly ‘selective’, when
the Nakagami fading parameter becomes m = 6, exhibiting narrow triangular shapes. As m
increases, the shapes will eventually converge to Kronecker delta functions
A possible approach to reducing the undulating behaviour of the average BPS throughput
curve is the introduction of a 3-BPS and a 5-BPS mode as additional constituent modem
modes. The power-efficiency of 8-Star QAM and 32-Star QAM is insufficient for maintaining
a linear growth of the average BPS throughput, as we can observe in Figure 22.37. Instead
the most power-efficient 8-ary QAM scheme (see page 279 of [388]) and the so-called ary
cross-shaped QAM scheme have a potential of reducing these undulation effects. However
since we observed in Section 22.9.1.1 and Section 22.9.1.2 that the relative SNR advantage
of employing adaptive Square QAM rapidly reduces, when the Nakagami fading parameter
increases, even though the additional 3-BPS and 5-BPS modes are also used, there seems to
be no significant benefit in employing non-square shaped additional constellations
Again, we can observe in Figure 22.37 that when the average SNR is less than γ̄ ≤ dB
the average BPS throughput of our adaptive Square QAM scheme decreases, as the Nakagami
fading parameter m increases. As we discussed in Section 22.9.1.2, this is due to the less

The effects of the Nakagami fading factor m on the relative SNR gain of our adaptive
Square QAM scheme can be observed in Figure 22.40. The less severe the fading, the smaller
the relative SNR advantage of employing adaptive Square QAM in comparison to its fixed
mode counterparts. Except for the 1-BPS mode, the SNR gains become less than 0.5dB, when
m is increased to 6 at the target BEP of Pth = 10−3. The trend observed is the same at the
target BEP of Pth = 10−6, showing relatively higher gains in comparison to the Pth =

22.9.2 Performance over Narrow-band Rayleigh Channels Using An
tenna Diversity
In the last section, we observed that the adaptive modulation schemes employing Square
QAM modes exhibit the highest BPS throughput among the schemes investigated, when op
erating over Nakagami fading channels. Hence, in this section we study the performance of
the adaptive Square QAM schemes employing antenna diversity operating over independent
Rayleigh fading channels. The BEP expression of the fixed-mode coherent BPSK scheme
can be found on Page 781 of [388] and those of coherent Square QAM can be readily ex
tended using the equations in (22.2) and (22.3). Furthermore, the antenna diversity scheme
operating over independent narrow-band Rayleigh fading channels can be viewed as a spe
cial case of the two-dimensional (2D) Rake receiver analysed in Appendices 31.2 and

Figure 22.41 depicts the average BPS throughput performance of our adaptive schemes
employing Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) aided antenna diversity [381] (Chapters 5 and
6) operating over independent Rayleigh fading channels at the target average BEP of Pth
10−3 and Pth = 10−6. The markers represent the performance of the corresponding fixed
mode Square QAM modems in the same scenario. The average SNRs required achieving
the target BEP of the fixed-mode schemes and that of the adaptive schemes decrease, as the
antenna diversity order increases. However, the differences between the required SNRs of the
adaptive schemes and their fixed-mode counterparts also decrease, as the antenna diversity
order increases. The SNRs of both schemes required for achieving the target BEPs of Pth
10−3 and Pth = 10−6 are displayed in Figure 22.42, where we can observe that dual antenna
diversity is sufficient for the fixed-mode schemes in order to obtain half of the achievable SNR
gain of the six-antenna aided diversity scheme, whereas triple-antenna diversity is required
for the adaptive schemes operating in the same scenario. The corresponding first switching
levels s1 are depicted in Figure 22.43 for different orders of antenna diversity up to an order
of six. As the antenna diversity order increases, the avalanche SNR becomes lower and
the switching-threshold undulation effects begin to appear. The required values of the first
switching level s1 are within a range of about 1dB and 0.5dB for the target BEPs of Pth
10−3 and Pth = 10−6, respectively, before the avalanche SNR is reached. This suggests
that the optimum mode-switching levels are more dependent on the target BEP, than on the
number of diversity antennas

22.9.3 Performance over Wideband Rayleigh Channels using Antenna
Diversity
Wideband fading channels are characterized by their multi-path intensity profiles (MIP). In
order to study the performance of the various adaptive modulation schemes, we employ two
different MIP models in this section, namely the shortened Wireless Asynchronous Transfer
Mode (W-ATM) channel of Figure 17.3 for an indoor scenario and a Bad-Urban Reduced
model A (BU-RA) channel [676] for a hilly urban outdoor scenario. Their MIPs are depicted
in Figure 22.44. The W-ATM channel exhibits short-range, low-delay multi-path compo
nents, while the BU-RA channel exhibits six higher-delay multi-path components. Again
let us assume that our receivers are equipped with MRC Rake receivers [677], employing
a sufficiently higher number of Rake fingers, in order to capture all the multi-path compo
nents generated by our channel models. Furthermore, we employ antenna diversity
(Chapter 5) at the receivers. This combined diversity scheme is often referred to as a two
dimensional (2D) Rake receiver [678] (Page 263). The BEP of the 2D Rake receiver trans
mission over wide-band independent Rayleigh fading channels is analysed in Appendix
A closed-form expression for the mode-specific average BEP of a 2D-Rake assisted adaptive
Square QAM scheme is also given in Appendix 31.3. Hence, the performance of our D
Rake assisted adaptive modulation scheme employing the optimum switching levels can be
readily obtained
The average BPS throughputs of the 2D-Rake assisted adaptive schemes operating over
the two different types of wideband channel scenarios are presented in Figure 22.45 at
the target BEP of Pth = 10−2. The throughput performance depicted corresponds to the

upper-bound performance of Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access DSCDMA
or Multi-Carrier CDMA employing Rake receivers and the MRC-aided diversity assisted
scheme in the absence of Multiple Access Interference (MAI). We can observe that the BPS
throughput curves undulate, when the number of antennas D increases. This effect is more
pronounced for transmission over the BU-RA channel, since the BU-RA channel exhibits
six multi-path components, increasing the available diversity potential of the system approx
imately by a factor of two in comparison to that of the W-ATM channel. The performance
of our adaptive scheme employing more than three antennas for transmission over the BU
RA channel could not be obtained owing to numerical instability, since the associated curves
become similar to a series of step-functions, which is not analytic in mathematical terms
A similar observation can be made in the context of Figure 22.46, where the target BEP is
Pth =
−3. Comparing Figure 22.45 and Figure 22.46, we observe that the BPS throughput
curves corresponding to Pth = 10−3 are similar to shifted versions of those corresponding
to Pth = 10−2, which are shifted in the direction of increasing SNRs. On the other hand
the BPS throughput curves corresponding to Pth = 10−3 undulate more dramatically. When
the number of antennas is D = 3, the BPS throughput curves of the BU-RA channel ex
hibit a stair-case like shape. The corresponding mode switching levels and mode selection
probabilities are shown in Figure 22.47. Again, the switching levels heavily undulate. The
mode-selection probability curve of BPSK has a triangular shape, increasing linearly, as the
average SNR γ̄ increases to 2.5dB and decreasing linearly again as γ̄ increases from dB
On the other hand, the mode-selection probability curve of QPSK increases linearly and de
creases exponentially, since no 3-BPS mode is used. This explains, why the BPS throughput
curves increase in a near-linear fashion in the SNR range of 0 to 5dB and in a stair-case fash

assisted adaptive schemes and by the fixed-mode schemes operating over (a) the WATM
channel and (b) the BU-RA channel
ion beyond that point. We can conclude that the stair-case like shape in the upper SNR range
of SNR is a consequence of the absence of the 3-BPS, 5-BPS and 7-BPS modulation modes
in the set of constituent modulation modes employed. As we discussed in Section
this problem may be mitigated by introducing power-efficient 8 QAM, 32 QAM and
QAM modes
The average SNRs required achieving the target BEP of Pth = 10−3 by the DRake
assisted adaptive scheme and the fixed-mode schemes operating over wide-band fading chan
nels are depicted in Figure 22.48. Since the fixed-mode schemes employing Rake receivers
are already enjoying the diversity benefit of multi-path fading channels, the SNR advantages
of our adaptive schemes are less than 8dB and 2.6dB over the W-ATM channel and over the
BU-RA channel, respectively, even when a single antenna is employed. This relatively small
SNR gain in comparison to those observed over narrow-band fading channels in Figure
erodes as the number of antennas increases. For example, when the number of antennas is
D = 6, the SNR gains of the adaptive schemes operating over the W-ATM channel of Fig
ure 22.44(a) become virtually zero, where the combined channel becomes an AWGNlike
channel. On the other hand, D = 3 number of antennas is sufficient for the BU-RA channel
for exhibiting such a behaviour, since the underlying multi-path diversity provided by the
six-path BU-RA channel is higher than that of the tree-path W-ATM channel

The performance of the various adaptive Square QAM schemes has been studied also in
the context of multi-carrier systems [179, 644, 679] . The family of Orthogonal Frequency

into frequency non-selective or flat Rayleigh channels for each sub-carrier, provided that the
number of sub-carriers is sufficiently high. The power and bit allocation strategy of adap
tive OFDM has attracted substantial research interests [179]. OFDM is particularly suitable
for combined time-frequency domain processing [644]. Since each sub-carrier of an OFDM
system experiences a flat Rayleigh channel, we can apply adaptive modulation for each sub
carrier independently from other sub-carriers. Although a practical scheme would group the
sub-carriers into similar-quality sub-bands for the sake of reducing the associated modem
mode signalling requirements. The performance of this AQAM assisted OFDM AOFDM
scheme is identical to that of the adaptive scheme operating over flat Rayleigh fading chan
nels, characterized in Section
MC-CDMA [251, 254] receiver can be regarded as a frequency domain Rakereceiver
where the multiple carriers play a similar role to that of the time-domain Rake fingers. Our
simulation results showed that the single-user BEP performance of MC-CDMA employing
multiple antennas is essentially identical to that of the time-domain Rake receiver using an
tenna diversity, provided that the spreading factor is higher than the number of resolvable
multi-path components in the channel. Hence, the throughput of the Rake-receiver over the
three-path W-ATM channel [179] and the six-path BU-RA channel [676] studied in Sec
tion 22.9.3 can be used for investigating the upper-bound performance of adaptive MC
CDMA schemes over these channels. Figure 22.49 compares the average BPS throughput
performances of these schemes, where the throughput curves of the various adaptive schemes
are represented as three different types of lines, depending on the underlying channel scenar
ios, while the fixed-mode schemes are represented as three different types of markers. The
solid line corresponds to the performance of A-OFDM and the marker ‘•’ corresponds to
that of the fixed-mode OFDM. On the other hand, the dotted lines correspond to the BPS

throughput performance of adaptive MC-CDMA operating over wide-band channels and the
markers  and ‘⊗’ to those of the fixed-mode MC-CDMA schemes
It can be observed that fixed-mode MC-CDMA has a potential to outperform AOFDM
when the underlying channel provides sufficient diversity due to the high number of resolv
able multi-path components. For example, the performance of fixed-mode MC-CDMA op
erating over the W-ATM channel of Figure 22.44(a) is slightly lower than that of AOFDM
for the BPS range of less than or equal to 6 BPS, owing to the insufficient diversity po
tential of the wide-band channel. On the other hand, fixed-mode MC-CDMA outperforms
A-OFDM, when the channel is characterized by the BU-RA model of Figure 22.44(b). We
have to consider several factors, in order to answer, whether fixed-mode MC-CDMA is better
than A-OFDM. Firstly, fully loaded MC-CDMA, which can transmit the same number of
symbols as OFDM, suffers from multi-code interference and our simulation results showed
that the SNR degradation is about 2-4dB at the BEP of 10−3, when the Minimum Mean
Square Error Block Decision Feedback Equalizer (MMSE-BDFE) [680] based joint detector
is used at the receiver. Considering these SNR degradations, the throughput of fixedmode
MC-CDMA using the MMSE-BDFE joint detection receiver falls just below that of the A
OFDM scheme, when the channel is characterized by the BU-RA model. On the other hand
the adaptive schemes may suffer from inaccurate channel estimation/prediction and modem
mode signalling feedback delay [183]. Hence, the preference order of the various schemes
may depend on the channel scenario encountered, on the interference effects and other prac
tical issues, such as the aforementioned channel estimation accuracy, feedback delays, etc
22.9.5 Concatenated Space-Time Block Coded and Turbo Coded
Symbol-by-Symbol Adaptive OFDM and Multi-Carrier CDMA
In the previous sections we studied the performance of uncoded adaptive schemes. Since a
Forward Error Correction (FEC) code reduces the SNR required for achieving a given target
BEP at the expense of a reduced BPS throughput, it is interesting to investigate the perfor
mance of adaptive schemes employing FEC techniques. These investigations will allow us
to gauge, whether channel coding is capable of increasing the system’s effective throughput
when aiming for a specific target BER. Another important question to be answered is whether
there are any further potential performance advantages, when we combine adaptive modula
tion with space-time coding. We note in advance that our related investigations are included
here with a view to draw the reader’s attention to the associated system design tradeoffs
rather than to provide an indepth comparative study of adaptive modulation and spacetime
coding. Hence for reasons of space economy here we will be unable to elaborate on the phi
losophy of space-time coding, we will simply refer to the associated literature for background
reading
A variety of FEC techniques has been used in the context of adaptive modulation schemes
In their pioneering work on adaptive modulation, Webb and Steele [176] used a set of bi
nary BCH codes. Vucetic [682] employed various punctured convolutional codes in re
sponse to the time-variant channel status. On the other hand, various Trellis Coded Modula
tion (TCM) [495,496] schemes were used in the context of adaptive modulation by Alamouti
and Kallel [683], Goldsmith and Chua [684], as well as Hole, Holm and Øien [208]. Keller

codes in the context of adaptive multi-carrier modulation [685, 686]. Various turbo
coded adaptive modulation schemes have been investigated also by Liew, Wong, Yee and
Hanzo [202,687,688]. With the advent of space-time (ST) coding techniques
various concatenated coding schemes combining ST coding and FEC coding can be applied
in adaptive modulation schemes. In this section, we investigate the performance of vari
ous concatenated space-time block-coded and turbo-coded adaptive OFDM and MCCDMA
schemes

Figure 22.50: Transmitter structure and space-time block encoding scheme
Figure 22.50 portrays the stylised transmitter structure of our system. The source bits are
channel coded by a half-rate turbo convolutional encoder [689] using a constraint length of
K = 3 as well as an interleaver having a memory of L = 3072 bits and interleaved by a ran
dom block interleaver. Then, the AQAM block selects a modulation mode from the set of no
transmission, BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM and 64-QAM depending on the instantaneous channel
quality perceived by the receiver, according to the SNR-dependent optimum switching levels
derived in Section 22.8.4. It is assumed that the perfectly estimated channel quality experi
enced by receiver A is fed back to transmitter B superimposed on the next burst transmitted
to receiver B. The modulation mode switching levels of our AQAM scheme determine the
average BEP as well as the average throughput
The modulated symbol is now space-time encoded. As seen at the bottom of Figure
Alamouti’s space-time block code [617] is applied across the frequency domain. A pair of
the adjacent sub-carriers belonging to the same space-time encoding block is assumed to have
the same channel quality. We employed a Wireless Asynchronous Transfer Mode WATM
channel model of Figure 17.1 transmitting at a carrier frequency of 60GHz, at a sampling
rate of 225MHz and employing 512 sub-carriers. Specifically, we used a three-path fading
channel model, where the average SNR of each path is given by γ̄1 = 0.79192γ̄, γ̄2
0.12424γ̄ and γ̄3 = 0.08384γ̄. The Multi-path Intensity Profile (MIP) of the W-ATM channel
is illustrated in Figure 22.44(a) in Section 22.9.3. Each channel associated with a different
antenna is assumed to exhibit independent fading
The simulation results related to our uncoded adaptive modems are presented in Fig

10−3 when transmitting over the W-ATM channel model of Figurefig:10+420. (a) The
constant average BEP is maintained for AOFDM and single user AMC-CDMA, while
‘full-user’ AMC-CDMA exhibits a slightly higher average BEP due to the residual MUI
(b) The SNR gain of the adaptive modems decreases, as ST coding increases the diversity
order. The BPS curves appear in pairs, corresponding to AOFDM and AMC-CDMA
indicated by the thin and thick lines, respectively - for each of the four different ST code
configurations. The markers represent the SNRs required by the fixed-mode OFDM and
MC-CDMA schemes for maintaining the target BER of 10−3 in conjunction with the
four ST-coded schemes considered
ure 22.51. Since we employed the optimum switching levels derived in Section 22.8.4, both
our adaptive OFDM (AOFDM) and the adaptive single-user MC-CDMA AMCCDMA
modems maintain the constant target BER of 10−3 up to the ‘avalanche’ SNR value, and
then follow the BER curve of the 64-QAM mode. However, ‘full-user’ AMC-CDMA, which
is defined as an AMC-CDMA system supporting U = 16 users with the aid of a spreading
factor of G = 16 and employing the MMSE-BDFE Joint Detection (JD) receiver
exhibits a slightly higher average BER, than the target of Bt = 10−3 due to the residual
Multi-User Interference (MUI) of the imperfect joint detector. Since in Section 22.8.4 we
derived the optimum switching levels based on a single-user system, the levels are no longer
optimum, when residual MUI is present. The average throughputs of the various schemes
expressed in terms of BPS steadily increase and at high SNRs reach the throughput of
QAM, namely 6 BPS. The throughput degradation of ‘full-user’ MC-CDMA imposed by the
imperfect JD was within a fraction of a dB. Observe in Figure 22.51(a) that the analytical
and simulation results are in good agreement, which we denoted by the lines and distinct
symbols, respectively
The effects of ST coding on the average BPS throughput are displayed in Figure b
Specifically, the thick lines represent the average BPS throughput of our AMC-CDMA sche
me, while the thin lines represent those of our AOFDM modem. The four pairs of hollow

and filled markers associated with the four different ST-coded AOFDM and AMCCDMA
scenarios considered represent the BPS throughput versus SNR values associated with fixed
mode OFDM and fixed-mode MMSE-BDFE JD assisted MC-CDMA schemes. Specifically
observe for each of the 1, 2 and 4 BPS fixed-mode schemes that the right most markers
namely the circles, correspond to the 1-Tx / 1-Rx scenario, the squares to the 2-Tx / Rx
scheme, the triangles to the 1-Tx / 2-Rx arrangement and the diamonds to the 2-Tx / Rx
scenarios. First of all, we can observe that the BPS throughput curves of OFDM and single
user MC-CDMA are close to each other, namely within 1 dB for most of the SNR range. This
is surprising, considering that the fixed-mode MMSE-BDFE JD assisted MC-CDMA scheme
was reported to exhibit around 10dB SNR gain at a BEP of 10−3 and 30dB gain at a BEP
of 10−6 over OFDM [256]. This is confirmed in Figure 22.51(b) by observing that the SNR
difference between the ◦ and • markers is around 10dB, regardless whether the 4, 2 or 1 BPS
scenario is concerned
Let us now compare the SNR gains of the adaptive modems over the fixed modems. The
SNR difference between the BPS curve of AOFDM and the fixed-mode OFDM represented
by the symbol ◦ at the same throughput is around 15dB. The corresponding SNR difference
between the adaptive and fixed-mode 4, 2 or 1 BPS MC-CDMA modem is around 5dB. More
explicitly, since in the context of the W-ATM channel model of Figure 17.1 fixed-mode MC
CDMA appears to exhibit a 10dB SNR gain over fixed-mode OFDM, the additional 5dB SNR
gain of AMC-CDMA over its fixed-mode counterpart results in a total SNR gain of dB
over fixed-mode OFDM. Hence ultimately the performance of AOFDM and AMCCDMA
becomes similar
Let us now examine the effect of ST block coding. The SNR gain of the fixedmode
schemes due to the introduction of a 2-Tx / 1-Rx ST block code is represented as the SNR
difference between the two right most markers, namely circles and squares. These gains are
nearly 10dB for fixed-mode OFDM, while they are only 3dB for fixed-mode MCCDMA
modems. However, the corresponding gains are less than 1dB for both adaptive modems
namely for AOFDM and AMC-CDMA. Since the transmitter power is halved due to using
two Tx antennas in the ST codec, a 3dB channel SNR penalty was already applied to the
curves in Figure 22.51(b). The introduction of a second receive antenna instead of a sec
ond transmit antenna eliminates this 3dB penalty, which results in a better performance for
the 1-Tx/2-Rx scheme than for the 2-Tx/1-Rx arrangement. Finally, the 2-Tx / 2-Rx system
gives around 3-4dB SNR gain in the context of fixed-mode OFDM and a 2-3dB SNR gain
for fixed-mode MC-CDMA, in both cases over the 1-Tx / 2-Rx system. By contrast, the SNR
gain of the 2-Tx / 2-Rx scheme over the 1-Tx / 2-Rx based adaptive modems was, again, less
than 1dB in Figure 22.51(b). More importantly, for the 2-Tx / 2-Rx scenario the advantage of
employing adaptive modulation erodes, since the fixed-mode MC-CDMA modem performs
as well as the AMC-CDMA modem in this scenario. Moreover, the fixed-mode MCCDMA
modem still outperforms the fixed-mode OFDM modem by about 2dB. We conclude that
since the diversity-order increases with the introduction of ST block codes, the channel qual
ity variation becomes sufficiently small for the performance advantage of adaptive modems to
erode. This is achieved at the price of a higher complexity due to employing two transmitters
and two receivers in the ST coded system
When channel coding is employed in the fixed-mode multi-carrier systems, it is ex
pected that OFDM benefits more substantially from the frequency domain diversity than
MC-CDMA, which benefited more than OFDM without channel coding. The simulation

Figure 22.52: Performance of turbo convolutional coded fixed-mode OFDM and MC-CDMA for trans
mission over the W-ATM channel of Figure 17.1, indicating that JD MC-CDMA still
outperforms OFDM. However, the SNR gain of JD MC-CDMA over OFDM is reduced
to 1-2dB at a BEP of
results depicted in Figure 22.52 show that the various turbo-coded fixed-mode MCCDMA
systems consistently outperform OFDM. However, the SNR differences between the turbo
coded BER curves of OFDM and MC-CDMA are reduced considerably
The performance of the concatenated ST block coded and turbo convolutional coded
adaptive modems is depicted in Figure 22.53. We applied the optimum set of switching
levels designed in Section 22.8.4 for achieving an uncoded BEP of 3 × 10−2. This uncoded
target BEP was stipulated after observing that it is reduced by half-rate, K = 3 turbo con
volutional coding to a BEP below 10−7, when transmitting over AWGN channels. However
our simulation results yielded zero bit errors, when transmitting 109 bits, except for some
SNRs, when employing only a single antenna
Figure 22.53(a) shows the BEP of our turbo coded adaptive modems, when a single
antenna is used. We observe in the figure that the BEP reaches its highest value around
the ‘avalanche’ SNR point, where the adaptive modulation scheme consistently activates
64-QAM. The system is most vulnerable around this point. In order to interpret this phe
nomenon, let us briefly consider the associated interleaving aspects. For practical reasons we
have used a fixed interleaver length of L = 3072 bits. When the instantaneous channel qual
ity was high, the L = 3072 bits were spanning a shorter time-duration during their passage
over the fading channel, since the effective BPS throughput was high. Hence the channel
errors appeared more bursty, than in the lower-throughput AQAM modes, which conveyed
the L = 3072 bits over a longer time duration, hence dispersing the error bursts over a longer
duration of time. The uniform dispersion of erroneous bits versus time enhances the error cor
rection power of the turbo code. On the other hand, in the SNR region beyond the avalanche
SNR point seen in Figure 22.53(a) the system exhibited a lower uncoded BER, reducing the
coded BEP even further. This observation suggests that further research ought to determine
the set of switching thresholds directly for a coded adaptive system, rather than by simply

tive OFDM and MC-CDMA systems communicating over the W-ATM channel of Fig

for most of the SNR range, resulting in virtually error free transmission. (a) The coded
BEP becomes higher near the ‘avalanche’ SNR point, when a single antenna was used
(b) The coded adaptive modems have SNR gains up to 7dB compared to their uncoded
counterparts achieving a comparable average BER
estimating the uncoded BER, which is expected to result in near-error-free transmission
We can also observe that the turbo coded BEP of AOFDM is higher than that of AMC
CDMA in the SNR range of 10-20dB, even though the uncoded BER is the same. This
appears to be the effect of the limited exploitation of frequency domain diversity of coded
OFDM, compared to MC-CDMA, which leads to a more bursty uncoded error distribution
hence degrading the turbo coded performance. The fact that ST block coding aided multiple
antenna systems show virtually error free performance corroborates our argument
Figure 22.53(b) compares the throughputs of the coded adaptive modems and the uncoded
adaptive modems exhibiting a comparable average BER. The SNR gains due to channel cod
ing were in the range of 0dB to 8dB, depending on the SNR region and on the scenarios em
ployed. Each bundle of throughput curves corresponds to the scenarios of 1-Tx/1-Rx OFDM
1-Tx/1-Rx MC-CDMA, 2-Tx/1-Rx OFDM, 2-Tx/1-Rx MC-CDMA, 1-Tx/2-Rx OFDM,
Tx/2-Rx MC-CDMA, 2-Tx/2-Rx OFDM and 2-Tx/2-Rx MC-CDMA starting from the far
right curve, when viewed for throughput values higher than 0.5 BPS. The SNR difference
between the throughput curves of the ST and turbo coded AOFDM and those of the corre
sponding AMC-CDMA schemes was reduced compared to the uncoded performance curves
of Figure 22.51(b). The SNR gain owing to ST block coding assisted transmit diversity in the
context of AOFDM and AMC-CDMA was within 1dB due to the halved transmitter power
Therefore, again, ST block coding appears to be less effective in conjunction with adaptive
modems
22.10. SUMMARY
In conclusion, the performance of ST block coded constant-power adaptive multicarrier
modems employing optimum SNR-dependent modem mode switching levels were investi
gated in this section. The adaptive modems maintained the constant target BEP stipulated
whilst maximizing the average throughput. As expected, it was found that ST block coding
reduces the relative performance advantage of adaptive modulation, since it increases the di
versity order and eventually reduces the channel quality variations. When turbo convolutional
coding was concatenated to the ST block codes, near-error-free transmission was achieved at
the expense of halving the average throughput. Compared to the uncoded system, the turbo
coded system was capable of achieving a higher throughput in the low SNR region at the cost
of a higher complexity. The study of the relationship between the uncoded BEP and the cor
responding coded BEP showed that adaptive modems obtain higher coding gains, than that of
fixed modems. This was due to the fact that the adaptive modem avoids burst errors even in
deep channel fades by reducing the number of bits per modulated symbol eventually to zero
22.10 Summary
Following a brief introduction to several fading counter-measures, a general model was used
to describe several adaptive modulation schemes employing various constituent modulation
modes, such as PSK, Star QAM and Square QAM, as one of the attractive fading counter
measures. In Section 22.7.3.1, the closed form expressions were derived for the average BER
the average BPS throughput and the mode selection probability of the adaptive modulation
schemes, which were shown to be dependent on the mode-switching levels as well as on the
average SNR. After reviewing in Section 22.8.1, 22.8.2 and 22.8.3 the existing techniques
devised for determining the mode-switching levels, in Section 22.8.4 the optimum switching
levels achieving the highest possible BPS throughput while maintaining the average target
BEP were developed based on the Lagrangian optimization method
Then, in Section 22.9.1 the performance of uncoded adaptive PSK, Star QAM and Square
QAM was characterized, when the underlying channel was a Nakagami fading channel. It
was found that an adaptive scheme employing a k-BPS fixed-mode as the highest throughput
constituent modulation mode was sufficient for attaining all the benefits of adaptive modula
tion, while achieving an average throughput of up to (k−1) BPS. For example, a threemode
adaptive PSK scheme employing No-Tx, 1-BPS BPSK and 2-BPS QPSK modes attained the
maximum possible average BPS throughput of 1 BPS and hence adding higherthroughput
modes, such as 3-BPS 8-PSK to the three-mode adaptive PSK scheme resulting in a four
mode adaptive PSK scheme did not achieve a better performance across the 1 BPS through
put range. Instead, this four-mode adaptive PSK scheme extended the maximal achievable
BPS throughput by any adaptive PSK scheme to 2 BPS, while asymptotically achieving a
throughput of 3 BPS as the average SNR increases
On the other hand, the relative SNR advantage of adaptive schemes in comparison to
fixed-mode schemes increased as the target average BER became lower and decreased as the
fading became less severe. More explicitly, less severe fading corresponds to an increased
Nakagami fading parameter m, to an increased number of diversity antennas, or to an in
creased number of multi-path components encountered in wide-band fading channels. As the
fading becomes less severe, the average BPS throughput curves of our adaptive Square QAM
schemes exhibit undulations owing to the absence of 3-BPS, 5-BPS and 7-BPS square QAM

modes
The comparisons between fixed-mode MC-CDMA and adaptive OFDM (AOFDM) were
made based on different channel models. In Section 22.9.4 it was found that fixed-mode MC
CDMA might outperform adaptive OFDM, when the underlying channel provides sufficient
diversity. However, a definite conclusion could not be drawn since in practice MCCDMA
might suffer from MUI and AOFDM might suffer from imperfect channel quality estimation
and feedback delays
Concatenated space-time block coded and turbo convolutional-coded adaptive multi
carrier systems were investigated in Section 22.9.5. The coded schemes reduced the required
average SNR by about 6dB-7dB at throughput of 1 BPS achieving near error-free transmis
sion. It was also observed in Section 22.9.5 that increasing the number of transmit antennas
in adaptive schemes was not very effective, achieving less than 1dB SNR gain, due to the
fact that the transmit power per antenna had to be reduced in order to limit the total transmit
power for the sake of fair comparison

Capacity and Cutoff Rate of
Gaussian and Rayleigh Channels
23.1 Introduction
An important accomplishment of information theory is the determination of the channel ca
pacity, C, which quantifies the maximum achievable transmission rate, C∗, of a system com
municating over a bandlimited channel, while maintaining an arbitrarily low probability of
error. Given the fact that the available bandwidth of all transmission media is limited, it is de
sirable to transmit information as bandwidth-efficiently, as possible. This implies transmitting
as many bits per Hertz, as possible. In recent years the available wireless communications
frequency bands have been auctioned by the American, British, German and by other gover
ments to service provider companies at a high price and therefore its is of high commercial
interest to exploit the available bandwidth as best as possible. Quantifying these information
theoretic limits is the objective of this chapter. Given these limits, in the rest of the book
we will aim for quantifying the various system’s ability to perform as close to the limits as
possible. This issue was first discussed in a rudimentary fashion in the context of Figure
and here we will considerably deepen our approach
The units of the channel capacity C and relative or normalised channel capacity C∗
C/T are bit per symbol and bit per second, respectively, where T is the symbol period. The
capacity of a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) AWGN channel was quantified by Shannon
in 1948 [551]. Since then, substantial research efforts have been invested in finding channel
codes that would produce an arbitrarily low probability of error at a transmission rate close to
C∗. Normalising the channel capacity with respect to the bandwidth occupied yields another
useful parameter, namely the bandwidth efficiency η. A lower bound to the channel capacity
referred to as the channel’s cutoff rate is another useful parameter. The cutoff rate, R
has been also referred to as the “practically achievable capacity”, since the complexity of a
coded system becomes substantially higher, when communicating near R0, in comparison to
transmissions at rates below R0 [494, 502,

23.2. CHANNEL CAPACITY
23.2 Channel Capacity
Let the input and output of the Discrete Memoryless Channel (DMC) [388] be X and Y
respectively, where X may assume one of K discrete-amplitude values, while Y can be one of
J legitimate discrete-amplitude values. The assignment of x = ak and y = bj corresponds to
encountering two specific events. Let the probability of encountering each event be denoted
as
p(k) = P (x = ak),
p(j) = P (y = bj),
while the conditional probability of receiving y = bj , given that x = ak was transmitted be
denoted as
p(j|k) = P (y = bj |x = ak).
Mutual information is by definition a measure of “information about the event x = ak pro
vided by the occurrence of the event y = bj”, which is defined as
IX;Y (ak; bj) = log

where the base of the logarithm is 2 and hence the units of mutual information are bits

738 CHAPTER 23. CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF GAUSSIAN AND RAYLEIGH CHANNELS
Naturally, in practise we do not have control over the probability of the channel’s input sym
bols and hence depending on the specific probabilities of the channel input symbols we may
not be able to approach the capacity of the channel
23.2.1 Vector Channel Model
It was argued in [503, pp. 348-351] that bandlimited signals having a finite energy may be
described as vectors having a dimensionality of
N = 2WT,
provided that the following assumptions are satisfied
1) the waveform is constrained to an ideal lowpass or bandpass bandwidth, W ; and
2) the waveform is limited to the time interval, 0 ≤ t ≤ T
Strictly speaking assumptions 1 and 2 cannot be fulfilled simultaneously, because accord
ing to the properties of the Fourier transform a finite-bandwidth signal has an infinite time
domain support and vice-versa. Let us however briefly consider a full-response Minimum
Shift Keying (MSK) [388] modulator, where the modulated signal’s spectrum has a sinc
function shape. The first and highest spectral side-lobe of the sinc-shaped spectrum is about
20 dB lower than the main spectral lobe, as seen for example in Figure 13.15 of [369]. Hence
we may argue that although the time-domain signalling pulse is time-limited, the correspond
ing spectrum has a low energy outside the main spectral lobe. This line of argument may be
continued by considering for example partial-response Gaussian MSK (GMSK) signalling
which results in substantially lower spectral side-lobes, than MSK, again as seen for ex
ample in Figure 13.15 of [369]. In fact the time-domain Gaussian pulse is known to have
the smoothest possible time-domain signalling pulse evolution, resulting in the most com
pact spectral-domain representation and a more-or-less bandlimited spectrum. Hence loosely
speaking we may argue that although according to the Fourier transform the spectraldomain
support of a finite-duration signal is infinite, for practical reasons the signal may be consid
ered both time- and band-limited. Similar arguments are also valid in case of fullresponse
Nyquist signalling based system such as those considered in this monograph
A set of functions is said to be orthonormal, if the functions are orthogonal to each other
and they are also normalised to unit energy within a common interval of T = T2 − T
yielding [693, p.

Orthonormal functions {φn(t)} can be generated using a variety of different methods, such
as the Fourier series and Gram-Schmidt procedures [388, pp. 167-173]. However, the dimen
sionality of the signal space remains N = 2WT , as long as the signals are being time and
bandlimited in the sense as argued above. Specifically, a bandlimited continuous-time sig
nalling waveform, x(t), can be expressed as a linear combination of orthonormal functions

for all n, where the integration is over the signalling period T . Let us now represent the

N -dimensional real-valued vectors. Note that x and y may be discrete-valued or continuous
valued, depending on the channel encountered
A relative of the DMC is the Continuous-Input Continuous-Output Memoryless Channel
(CCMC) [388], where the corresponding coefficients of x and y are continuous-valued as
indicated below
x[n] ∈ [−∞,+∞],
y[n] ∈ [−∞,+∞], n = 1, . . . , N.
This model is applicable to a scenario employing an analogue modulation scheme, such
as amplitude, phase or frequency modulation. The channel capacity of the DMC in Equa

where again, x = (x[1], . . . , x[N ]) and y = (y[1], . . . , y[N ]) are N -dimensional signals at

Another relative of the DMC is the Discrete-Input Continuous-Output Memoryless Chan
nel (DCMC) [388], where the channel input belongs to the discrete set of M -ary values
x ∈ {xm : m = 1, . . . ,M}.
More explicitly, the channel input xm = (xm[1], . . . , xm[N ]) is a log2(M)-bit symbol hav
ing N discrete-valued coefficients. By contrast, the channel output y has continuousvalued
coefficients
y[n] ∈ [−∞,+∞], n = 1, . . . , N.

23.2.2 The Capacity of AWGN Channels
The Shannon bound of an AWGN channel is obtained by finding the capacity of a continuous
input continuous-output AWGN channel, where the modulated signal itself, x(t), may be
modelled by bandlimited Gaussian noise 1 at the channel input, which is contaminated by
the AWGN channel noise n(t). After bandlimiting, the samples of both noise sources are
taken at the Nyquist rate. These samples are independent identical distributed (iid) Gaussian
random variables with zero mean having a variance of σ2 for x(t) and N0/2 for n(t). The
resultant sampled waveforms can be described as vectors of N discrete-time but continuous
valued samples, where N = 2WT is the signal dimensionality defined in Equation
Upon exploiting that the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) of p(x), p(y) and p(y|x) are
Gaussian, the Shannon bound can be derived from Equation 23.14 as [551,

log2(1 + γ) [bit/symbol],
where γ is the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR). Note that when the channel input is a continuous
valued variable corresponding to an analogue modulation scheme, the capacity is only re
stricted either by the signalling energy and hence γ or by the bandwidth W [388]. Therefore
we will refer to the capacity of the CCMC as the unrestricted bound
Let us now consider the achievable capacity of DCMC, when transmitting the N

23.2.3 The Capacity of Uncorrelated Rayleigh Fading Channels
Let us define h = hi + jhq as the complex uncorrelated Rayleigh fading coefficient, where
hi and hq are the in-phase and quadrature-phase coefficients, respectively. Specifically, hi
and hq are zero mean iid Gaussian random variables, each having a variance of σ2r =
Note that σ2r is normalised to 1/2 so that the average energy of |h|2 is unity. Furthermore the

The capacity of continuous-input continuous-output uncorrelated (memoryless) Rayleigh

probability of encountering the specific SNR determined by the Rayleigh fading magnitude

Equation 23.26 is taken over χ22[n] and Ω[n]. Note that the relationship between Equa

Note that when the channel is real, where only the in-phase coefficient hi is considered

the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading coefficient is given by h = hi. Explicitly, hi is a zero mean
iid Gaussian random variable having a variance of σ2r = 1. We also have

2, which is
a chi-squared distributed random variable with one degree of freedom. Hence, for the case
of N -dimensional M -ary real signals, such as M -ary orthogonal signalling [388] having

23.3 Channel Cutoff Rate
The cutoff rate R0 of the channel is defined as a channel capacity related quantity such that
for any R < R0, it is possible to construct a channel code having a block length n and
coding rate of at least R capable of maintaining an average error probability that obeys Pe
2−n(R0−R) [388]. As mentioned before, R0 has also been referred to as the practically
achievable capacity” of channel coded systems, where communication at rates above R0 is
typically far more complex to implement, than at rates below R0 [494,502,691]. For example
as soon as the coding rate reaches R0, the expected number of computation per nodes in the
context of sequential decoding [502] tends to infinity. Although it is maintained that turbo
codes are indeed capable of operating at rates above R0, their decoding does get substantially
more complex, as R exceeds R
Apart from the above complexity-related context, R0 is also used as an analytical bound
limiting the bit error ratio performance of various classes of random codes designed for spe
cific channels [365, 700]. Furthermore, R0 constitutes a lower bound of the channel capacity
and it is more straightforward to compute compared to the channel capacity. In general, the
cutoff rate associated with M -ary QAM/PSK signalling and a Rician fading channel in the
presence of perfect channel magnitude and phase estimates is given by
R0 = 2 log2(M)− log

AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels
23.4 Bandwidth Efficiency
The capacity analysis of the CCMC and DCMC provided in Section 23.2 determines the
maximum number of information bits conveyed per transmitted symbol, as a function of the
SNR. The system’s bandwidth efficiency may be expressed as the capacity C normalised by
the product of the bandwidth W occupied and the symbol period T , given by

23.5 Channel Capacity and Cutoff Rate of M -ary Modula
tion
In this section we will quantify the capacity, cutoff rate, bandwidth efficiency and normalised
cutoff rate of the AWGN and the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels for a range of M ary
signalling sets based on the DCMC model. The unrestricted bounds of the AWGN and uncor
related Rayleigh fading channels based on the CCMC model are also plotted for comparisons
Explicitly, the capacity of the AWGN CCMC and DCMC is computed using Equation
and Equation 23.21, respectively. By contrast, the capacity of the uncorrelated Rayleigh fad
ing CCMC may be computed using Equation 23.25, while that of the DCMC is quantified
using Equations 23.26, 23.28 and 23.29. On the other hand, the cutoff rate of the channel
is determined using Equation 23.30 as well as Equations 23.32 and 23.33 for the AWGN
and Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. Finally, the bandwidth efficiency curves of the
DCMC and CCMC are evaluated using Equations 23.34 and 23.35, while the normalised
cutoff rate of the DCMC is computed using Equation
23.5.1 Introduction
An M -ary modulator is a device that maps each of the discrete-time symbols belonging to
a set of M alphabets into one of the M continuous-time analogue waveforms suitable for
transmission over the physical channel. There are many types of modulation techniques
differing in the way they manipulate an electromagnetic signal. Such manipulations include
changing the amplitude, frequency or phase angle of a sinusoidal signal, the polarisation of
the electromagnetic radiation or the pulse position within a modulation interval
746 CHAPTER 23. CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF GAUSSIAN AND RAYLEIGH CHANNELS
There are several different signalling pulse shaping functions. Most often, pulse shaping
is carried out in the frequency-domain by designing a Nyquist filter having a certain rolloff
factor α, as shown in Figure 4.6. Alternatively, pulse shaping may be implemented in the
time-domain, as seen in Figure 4.15. The choice of the pulse shaping function influences the
spectrum of the transmitted signal. More specifically, rectangular signalling pulses give rise
to an infinite bandwidth requirement. By contrast, the raised cosine time-domain pulse shap
ing principle of Figure 4.6 results in a more compact spectrum. On one hand, the halfcycle
sinusoidal time-domain pulse shaping function was utilised in the Minimum Shift Keying
(MSK) scheme of [388, pp. 197-199]. On the other hand, the Q2PSK and Q2AM schemes
outlined in Chapter 13 employ both sinusoidal and cosinusoidal pulse shaping functions. For
the sake of simplicity, we will employ the rectangular time-domain pulse shaping function
for illustrating the implementation of M -ary modulation techniques. We define the signalling
pulse duration as Tp and the modulated symbol duration as Ts. As seen in Figure 4.5 for ex
ample, the baseband equivalent filter response of a rectangular frequency-domain Nyquist
filter associated with α = 0 spans from −fN = −1/2Tp to fN = 1/2Tp. Hence the band
width required is given by W = 2fN = 1/Tp and the number of signal dimensions is given
by Equation 23.8 as N = 2WTs, when obeying the assumptions made in Section
As explained in Section 13.2, we note that the MSK scheme exploits only two out of
the four possible signalling dimensions available. On the other hand, when the channel is
strictly bandlimited, the Q2PSK and Q2AM signalling schemes outlined in Chapter 13 have
an identical bandwidth efficiency to their classic QPSK and QAM counterparts, despite being
more difficult to implement. Furthermore, the MSK, Q2PSK and Q2AM signalling schemes
require two different carrier frequencies as we have shown briefly in Equations 13.4 and
of Chapter 13. Therefore, we do not study the family of MSK, Q2PSK and Q2AM signalling
schemes in this chapter
23.5.2 M -ary Phase Shift Keying
M -ary Phase Shift Keying (PSK) constitutes a signalling scheme, where the logMbit
information to be transmitted is mapped to M number of phases of the transmitted carrier

Specifically, each phasor xm of the PSK signalling set has an equal energy and its signalling

Es. Figure 23.1 depicts an example of
PSK signalling having M = 16 for the sake of conveying 4 information bits per symbol. In
the context of classic M -ary PSK signalling, the duration of the rectangular signalling pulse
Tp equals the modulated symbol duration Ts, as illustrated in Figure 23.1. Therefore, the
bandwidth required is W = 1/Tp = 1/Ts Hz and the number of dimensions offered by the
signal space is N = 2WTs = 2. During a symbol duration Ts, a phasor xm chosen from the
M legitimate phasors in the constellation is transmitted. Since we have WTs = N/2 =
the asymptotic value of the bandwidth efficiency is similar to that of the achievable capacity
of the classic PSK signalling sets. Note that when we have M = 2, 2-PSK signalling utilises
only 1 out of the 2 possible signalling dimensions
We may conclude that PSK signalling does not constitute an efficient scheme, since it
has to obey the PSK limit [705], which is significantly lower than the unrestricted bound of
Equation 23.18. The PSK limit for AWGN channels is given by [705, pp.

occurrence given by the Rayleigh-faded magnitude χ22, which was defined in Section

23.5. CHANNEL CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF M -ARY MODULATION
cutoff rate and PSK limit of the M -ary PSK signals, when communicating over AWGN and
Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. As we can observe from Figure 23.2(a), at a capacity
of b = 3 bit/symbol the SNR performance of the 2b+1 = 16-PSK scheme is about 3 dB
better than that of the 2b = 8-PSK scheme, when communicating over an AWGN chan
nel. Even more significantly, when communicating over a Rayleigh fading channel, the SNR
performance of the 16-PSK scheme is about 13 dB better than that of the 8-PSK scheme
at a capacity of 3 bit/symbol, as it is shown in Figure 23.3(a). However, at a capacity of
b = 3 bit/symbol, the PSK schemes having M > 2b+1 yield very little additional SNR gain in
comparison to 16-PSK. More explicitly, all PSK signalling schemes having M > 16 perform
virtually identically to 16-PSK at a capacity of b = 3 bit/symbol, when communicating over
AWGN channels, as evidenced by Figure 23.2(a). When communicating over uncorrelated
Rayleigh fading channels, an SNR gain of less than 0.5 dB is obtained by a PSK signalling
schemes having M > 16 in comparison to 16-PSK at a capacity of b = 3 bit/symbol, as it
is shown in Figure 23.3(a). Similar observations are also true for b ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 6}, as it is
evidenced by Figures 23.2 and 23.3. Therefore, in order to approach the achievable capac
ity of b bit/symbol, it is better to employ 2b+1-PSK, rather than 2b-PSK. At first sight this
statement may seem inplausible, however, we will show in Chapter 24 that this is exactly the
motivation of Ungerböck’s Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) scheme, where the modulation
constellation size is doubled for the sake of accommodating an extra bit. This extra bit is used
in TCM for error correction, potentially allowing us to operate without errors at the cost of a
higher complexity but at a lower SNR, i.e. to approach the capacity limit more closely. As a
further observation, by doubling M from 2b to 2b+1 most of the total achievable gain can be
obtained, when aiming for a capacity of C = b bit/symbol and any further expansion of the
modulation constellation is only likely to yield marginal SNR benefits
By comparing Figures 23.2 and 23.3, we notice that the SNR or Eb/N0 gap between
the capacity and cutoff rate of the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel is wider than that
observed for the AWGN channel. For example, at a capacity of 3 bit/symbol the SNR gap be
tween the capacity curve and cutoff rate curve of 16-PSK communicating over AWGN chan
nels and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels is about 1 dB (as shown in Figure a
and 4 dB (as shown in Figure 23.3(a)), respectively. This implies that it is harder to reach the
capacity of the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel compared to that of the AWGN channel
Additionally, the SNR gap between the capacity of M -ary PSK and the unrestricted bound
becomes larger for increasing values of M at a capacity of (log2(M) − 1) bit/symbol. For
example, when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, the SNR gap be
tween the capacity curve of 4-PSK and the unrestricted bound at 1 bit/symbol is only about
1 dB. By contrast, the SNR gap between the capacity curve of 64-PSK and the unrestricted
bound is approximately 10 dB, as we can observe from Figure 23.3(a). This is a consequence
of the convergence of the PSK curves to the ultimate PSK limit mentioned earlier
23.5.3 M -ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
M -ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) may be viewed as a combination of two
independent Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) schemes. The modulated signalling wave
forms may be expressed as in Equation 23.41 and the two orthonormal basis functions are
similar to that of PSK, which are given by Equations 23.42 and 23.43. Specifically, the QAM
signalling set maps each message block onto a rectangular phasor constellation based on the

originally proposed in [496], exhibits a higher minimum Euclidean distance compared to the
rectangular 8-QAM of [388, p. 180], although its peak-to-mean envelope and its phasejitter

rectangular signalling pulse Tp equals the modulated symbol duration Ts, as depicted in Fig
ure 23.5. Therefore, the bandwidth required is W = 1/Tp = 1/Ts Hz and the number of
dimensions of the signalling space is N = 2WTs = 2. During a symbol duration Ts, a
phasor xm chosen from the M legitimate phasors of the constellation is transmitted. Since
we have WTs = N/2 = 1, the asymptotic value of the bandwidth efficiency is similar to that
of the achievable capacity of the classic QAM signalling sets
Figures 23.6 and 23.7 show the achievable capacity, cutoff rate, bandwidth efficiency
and normalised cutoff rate of the family of M -ary QAM signals, when communicating over
AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. Similar to our finding in the context of
752 CHAPTER 23. CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF GAUSSIAN AND RAYLEIGH CHANNELS
the M -ary PSK results of Section 23.5.2, in order to achieve a capacity of b bit/symbol, it is
better to employ 2b+1-ary QAM, rather than the QAM scheme having M = 2b or M > b
Explicitly, by doubling M from 2b to 2b+1 most of the achievable capacity gain may be ob
tained when aiming for a capacity of C = b bit/symbol. For example, as evidenced in Fig
ure 23.7(a), the SNR required for 8-QAM, 16-QAM, 32-QAM and 64-QAM is about 28 dB
12 dB, 11 dB and 11 dB, respectively, when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fad
ing channels at a capacity of b = 3 bit/symbol. It is also harder to approach the capacity of the
Rayleigh fading channel compared to the AWGN channel in the context of QAM, as a con
sequence of having a wider SNR gap between the capacity and cutoff rate of Rayleigh fading
channels compared to that of the AWGN channels. For example, at a capacity of 3 bitsymbol
the SNR gap between the capacity curve and cutoff rate curve of 16-QAM when communi
cating over AWGN channels and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels is about 2 dB as
shown in Figure 23.6(a)) and 5 dB (as shown in Figure 23.7(a)), respectively. However, as
seen by comparing Figures 23.3(a) and 23.7(a), the SNR performance difference between
the unrestricted bound and the capacity of M -ary QAM is significantly smaller than that of
the M -ary PSK scheme of Section 23.5.2. As we can see from Figures 23.3(a) and a
the SNR requirement of 5 bit/symbol signalling at the unrestricted bound as well as when
using 64-QAM and 64-PSK communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels is
approximately 17 dB, as well as 20 dB and 26 dB, respectively. This indicates that QAM is
potentially more bandwidth efficient than PSK. Again, a practical manifestation of this state
ment will be detailed in the context of TCM in Chapter 24, where the expanded signalling
constellation accommodates an error correction code, potentially allowing the expanded pha
sor constellation to approach the capacity more closely owing to its better error resilience
despite its reduced minimum distance amongst the constellation points
23.5.4 M -ary Orthogonal Signalling
M -ary orthogonal signalling constitutes a transmission scheme, where log2(M) number of
bits are mapped to M orthogonal waveforms, as for example in the IS-95 CDMA standard
which is also known as cdmaOne [706]. The bandwidth requirement of M -ary orthogonal
signalling is given by [388, p.
W
M
Ts
,
where Ts is the symbol duration and hence this signalling scheme may also be interpreted as
a collection of phasor points in the N = 2WTs = M -dimensional phasor space, where only
one phasor point is located on each of the M coordinate axes. The M -dimensional signalling
vectors can be represented as [388,

which may be constructed from non-overlapping signalling pulses as follows
φm[i]

0, i 6= m.
Note that M -ary orthogonal signalling is more power-efficient and more error-resilient, but
less bandwidth efficient compared to classic M -ary PSK and QAM [388, p. 284]. Figure
depicts an example of the M -ary orthogonal signalling scheme having M = N = 16 for the
sake of conveying 4 information bits per symbol. In M -ary orthogonal signalling, the dura
tion of the rectangular pulse is given by Tp = Ts/M , as seen in Figure 23.8. However, the
bandwidth required is given by Equation 23.50 as W = M2Ts = 1/2Tp Hz, which is different
from that of the QAM and PSK schemes. The number of dimensions of the signalling space is
N = 2WTs = M . During a symbol duration Ts, only one pulse duration is active, while the
rest are inactive, when the orthonormal basis functions are constructed as nonoverlapping
pulses according to Equation 23.53. Since we have WTs = N/2 = M/2, the asymptotic
value of bandwidth efficiency is different from that of the capacity of the M -ary orthogonal
signalling sets for values of M >
Figures 23.9 and 23.10 show the capacity, cutoff rate, bandwidth efficiency and nor
malised cutoff rate of M -ary orthogonal signalling, when communicating over AWGN and
Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. Note that the unrestricted bound of Equation
is dependent on WT = N/2, hence it is different for different dimensionality values N
However, the normalised unrestricted bound expressed in Equation 23.35 is independent of
WT = N/2. As shown in Figures 23.9(a) and 23.10(a), the channel capacity curves reach
the asymptotic performance of log2(M) bit/symbol at low SNRs, when increasing the value
of M . This trend is different from the channel capacity curves recorded for classic PSK
and QAM. As depicted in Figures 23.9(b) and 23.10(b), unlike for classic PSK and QAM
signals, the bandwidth efficiency of M -ary orthogonal signalling is farther away from the
unrestricted bound at low Eb/N0 values as M decreases. This phenomenon is a consequence
of having non-zero centre of gravity or mean in M -ary orthogonal signalling, which is given

dB. Hence, as
M increases, the bandwidth efficiency curves converge more closely to the Shannon bound
However, since we have WT = M/2 > 1 for M > 2, the asymptotic value of the band
width efficiency is a factor of M/2 lower than that of the capacity of the M-ary orthogonal
signalling set. Therefore, as M → ∞, we have η = CM/2 → 0, which implies having a zero
bandwidth efficiency. Similar to the related findings for classic PSK and QAM, the SNR gap
between the capacity and cutoff rate of the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel is wider
than that of the AWGN channel. For example, at a capacity of 2 bit/symbol the SNR gap
between the capacity curve and cutoff rate curve of 8-orthogonal signalling communicating
over AWGN channels and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels is about 2 dB (as shown in
Figure 23.9(a)) and 5.5 dB (as shown in Figure 23.10(a)), respectively. This indicates that it
is harder to reach the capacity of the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel compared to that
of the AWGN channel
23.5.5 L-Orthogonal PSK Signalling
L-orthogonal PSK signalling constitutes a hybrid form of M -ary orthogonal and classic PSK
signalling [698,699], comprised of V number of independent L-ary PSK subsets. Therefore
the total number of available signalling waveforms is M = V L and hence the number of bits
transmitted per signalling symbol is log2(V L). The total number of dimensions is N = 2V

Furthermore, the orthonormal basis function φv = (φv[1], φv[2], . . . , φv[V ]) is a vector of

tion
Specifically, the vector of an L-orthogonal PSK signalling set having L = 8 and V =

where the total number of legitimate waveforms is M = V L = 16 and hence the number
of bits per symbol is log2(M) = 4. Explicitly, the L-orthogonal PSK signalling set hav
ing L = 8 and V = 2 is illustrated in Figure 23.11. As we can see from Figure
the duration of the rectangular pulse is given by Tp = Ts/V and during a modulated sym
bol duration Ts, only one signalling pulse of duration Tp is active, while the rest of them
inactive when the orthonormal basis functions are constructed as non-overlapping pulses ac
cording to Equation 23.53. A phasor xm chosen from the L = 8 legitimate phasors in the
8-PSK constellation is transmitted, when the corresponding pulse-slot is active. The band
width required is W = 1/Tp = V/Ts, hence the number of dimensions of the signal space is
N = 2WTs = 2V . Therefore, we have
V = WTs
N

.
Since we have WTs = N/2 = V , the asymptotic value of bandwidth efficiency is a factor
of V lower than the capacity. When V = 1, we have L = M and hence L-orthogonal PSK
signalling becomes analogous to classic M -ary PSK signalling. Note that L-orthogonal PSK
signalling requires only V = N/2 number of timeslots for conveying a symbol, whereas the
M -ary orthogonal signalling waveforms of Section 23.5.4 require N number of timeslots for

sion rate of L-orthogonal PSK signalling is a factor of two higher than that of M -ary orthog
onal signalling. Furthermore, at a given dimensionality N there are M = V L = NL
number of waveforms in the context of L-orthogonal PSK signalling, which is a factor of
L/2 times higher than that of classic M -ary orthogonal signalling. However, at a given value
of M , L-orthogonal PSK signalling is V = M/L times less bandwidth efficient, than the
classic M -ary PSK signalling scheme
Figures 23.12 and 23.13 portray the capacity, cutoff rate, bandwidth efficiency and nor
malised cutoff rate of L-orthogonal PSK signalling schemes having V = 2, when commu
nicating over AWGN and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. Similar to
classic PSK signalling, most of the achievable gain has already been attained by doubling the
value of L and very little additional gain may be achieved, if L is further increased. More
758 CHAPTER 23. CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF GAUSSIAN AND RAYLEIGH CHANNELS
explicitly, as we can observe from Figure 23.13(a), the 16-orthogonal PSK having V =
is approximately 14 dBs better than the 8-orthogonal PSK having V = 2 at a capacity of
bit/symbol. It is also harder to approach the capacity of the uncoded Rayleigh fading channel
compared to the AWGN channel, since there is a wider SNR gap between the capacity and
cutoff rate of the Rayleigh fading channel compared to that of the AWGN channel
Since we have M = V L for the L-orthogonal PSK signalling, the capacity of L
orthogonal PSK signalling is log

L

= log2(V ) bit higher than that of the classic Lary
PSK subset. However, the bandwidth efficiency of L-orthogonal PSK signalling is V log2(L)log2(V L
times lower than that of its L-ary PSK subset. For example, 16-PSK signalling has a ca
pacity of C = 4 bit/symbol and bandwidth efficiency of η = 4 bit/s/Hz. By contrast, the
L-orthogonal PSK signalling employing V = 2 number of 16-PSK subsets has C = 5 and
η = 2.5. Therefore, L-orthogonal PSK signalling having V = 2 and L = 16 is 5 − 4 =
bit higher than 16-PSK in terms of capacity, but it is 4/2.5 = 1.6 times lower than PSK
in terms of bandwidth efficiency, where log2(V ) = 1 and
V logL
log2(V L

As we can see from Figures 23.12 and 23.13, L-orthogonal PSK signalling also exhibits
an PSK limit. In general, the ultimate limit of L-orthogonal PSK signalling when communi
cating over AWGN channels may be derived from Equation 23.46 as

where EsN0 = V γ according to Equation 23.22, since we have V = N/2 and γ is the SNR

nicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels can be expressed as

unchanged. The L-orthogonal PSK limit curves calculated for V = 1, 2, 4 and 8 are
illustrated in Figures 23.14(a) and 23.15(a). In terms of the achievable bandwidth efficiency
according to Equations 23.34 and 23.59, we may express the normalised L-orthogonal PSK

Therefore, the gradient of the normalised L-orthogonal PSK limit is reduced by a factor of V
as portrayed in Figures 23.14(b) and 23.15(b). From Figures 23.12, 23.13, 23.14 and
we can see that L-orthogonal PSK signalling becomes inefficient for a large value of L and V
For example, when communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, the SNR gap
between the capacity curve of 4-orthogonal PSK and the unrestricted bound at 2 bitsymbol
is only about 1.5 dB. By contrast, the SNR gap between the capacity curve of orthogonal
PSK and the unrestricted bound is approximately 13.5 dB, as we can observe from Fig
ure 23.13(a), when we have V = 2. Furthermore, the L-orthogonal PSK limit curves is
760 CHAPTER 23. CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF GAUSSIAN AND RAYLEIGH CHANNELS
farther away from the unrestricted bound for higher values of V , as we can observe from
Figure 23.15(b). More specifically, at a bandwidth efficiency of η = 2 bit/s/Hz the EbN
gap between the unrestricted bound and L-orthogonal PSK limit curves plotted for V =
and V = 4 is about 4.5 dB and 19.5 dB, respectively, as it is evidenced by Figure b
23.5.6 L-Orthogonal QAM Signalling
The novel message of this section is that L-orthogonal signalling may also incorporate QAM
subsets instead of the PSK subsets, which have to obey the ultimate PSK limit. Explicitly
L-orthogonal QAM signalling constitutes a hybrid form of M -ary orthogonal and QAM sig
nalling. Similar to L-orthogonal PSK, it comprised of V independent L-ary QAM subsets
The total number of legitimate waveforms is M = V L and the number of transmitted bits per
symbol is log2(V L). The total number of dimensions is N = 2V . The vector representation
of L-orthogonal QAM signalling may be formulated as

where xLQAMl is the classic 2-dimensional L-ary QAM signal vector given by Equa

Figure 23.16 depicts an example of the L-orthogonal QAM signalling scheme having
L = 4 and V = 4, which conveys 4 information bits per symbol. In the L-orthogonal QAM
signalling scheme, the duration of the rectangular signalling pulse is given by Tp = Ts/V
23.5. CHANNEL CAPACITY AND CUTOFF RATE OF M -ARY MODULATION
as it was shown in Figure 23.5. Therefore, the bandwidth required is W = 1/Tp = V/Ts Hz
and the number of dimensions of the signalling space is N = 2WTs = 2V . A phasor
xm chosen from the L legitimate phasors in the 4-QAM constellation is transmitted for a
signalling pulse duration of Tp, followed by silence for the rest of the (V − 1) timeslots
since the orthonormal basis functions are constructed as non-overlapping pulses according to
Equation 23.53. Since we have WTs = N/2 = V , the asymptotic value of the bandwidth
efficiency of L-orthogonal QAM signalling is a factor of V lower than the capacity. More
explicitly, the vector of an L-orthogonal QAM signalling set having L = 4 and V = 4 may

where the number of signalling waveforms is M = V L = 16 and the number of signalling
dimensions is N = 2V = 8. Again, when we have V = 1, the L-orthogonal QAM scheme
becomes a classic QAM signalling scheme. We can expect the L-orthogonal QAM scheme
to exhibit a better performance, in terms of bandwidth efficiency versus Eb/N0 and capac
ity versus SNR, than that of L-orthogonal PSK, since the performance of QAM studied in
Section 23.5.3 was shown to be better than that of PSK studied in Section
Figures 23.17 and 23.18 characterise the capacity, cutoff rate, bandwidth efficiency and
normalised cutoff rate of L-orthogonal QAM signalling schemes, when communicating over
both AWGN and uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels, respectively. Similar to classic
QAM signalling, most of the achievable gain are already attained by doubling the modu
lation levels M from L to 2L, when aiming for a capacity of log2(V L) bit/symbol. More
explicitly, as we can observe from Figure 23.18(a), the 16-orthogonal QAM having V =
is approximately 18 dBs better than the 8-orthogonal QAM having V = 2 at a capacity
of 4 bit/symbol. Again, the SNR gap between the capacity and cutoff rate of the uncorre
lated Rayleigh fading channel is wider than that of the AWGN channel. Specifically, the
SNR gap between the capacity and cutoff rate of the uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channel
is approximately 6 dBs at a capacity of 4 bit/symbol, in the context of 16-orthogonal QAM
having V = 2 as shown in Figure 23.18(a). By contrast, as we can see from Figure a
the corresponding SNR gap between the capacity and cutoff rate of AWGN is only about

nel compared to the AWGN channel for the L-orthogonal QAM signalling scheme. Similar
to the L-orthogonal QAM signalling, the L-orthogonal QAM signalling is capable of achiev
ing log2(V ) bits higher throughput than that of the classic L-ary QAM subset, at a cost of

times lower bandwidth efficiency than that of the L-ary QAM subset. Although the
SNR gap between L-orthogonal QAM signalling and the unrestricted bound becomes wider
upon increasing L and V , yet this gap is significantly narrower than that of Lorthogonal
PSK signalling. For example, the L-orthogonal QAM scheme outperforms the Lorthogonal
PSK scheme by an SNR gain of 7 dB, when employing L = 64 and V = 2 at a capacity of
6 bit/symbol, as evidenced by Figures 23.13(a) and 23.18(a). Since we have WTs = V , the
asymptotic value of the bandwidth efficiency is V times lower than that of the capacity, as
shown in Figures 23.17 and
Note that both L-orthogonal PSK signalling and L-orthogonal QAM signalling schemes
23.6. SUMMARY
have twice the bandwidth efficiency compared to the M -ary orthogonal signalling scheme
at a given number of modulation levels M . For instance, the M = 8-orthogonal signalling
scheme can only achieve a throughput of 0.75 bit/s/Hz, as seen in Figure 23.10(b). However
both L-orthogonal PSK signalling and L-orthogonal QAM signalling having M = V L
2×4 = 8 may achieve a throughput of 1.5 bit/s/Hz, as seen in Figures 23.13(b) and b
Furthermore, it was shown in [388] that orthogonal signalling schemes, such as M -ary or
thogonal signalling is more error resilient than non-orthogonal signalling schemes, such as the
classic QAM arrangement. Hence we can expect the L-orthogonal QAM signalling scheme
to be more error resilient than the classic QAM signalling arrangement
23.6 Summary
In this chapter, we have studied the capacity C, cutoff rate R0, bandwidth efficiency η and
the normalised cutoff rate R0,η of M -ary PSK, M -ary QAM, M -ary orthogonal signalling as
well as the hybrid of PSK/QAM and orthogonal signalling schemes. The novel contributions
of this chapter are
• the introduction of Equation 23.28 for evaluating the performance of N dimensional
M -ary signalling schemes communicating over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels
• the introduction of Equation 23.47, which quantifies the ultimate PSK limit for trans
mission over uncorrelated Rayleigh fading channels
• the introduction of L-orthogonal QAM signalling, as an extension of Lorthogonal
PSK signalling
• the introduction of Equations 23.56 and 23.65 for representing L-orthogonal signalling
employing PSK and QAM subsets, respectively, and
• the introduction of Equations 23.62 and 23.63 for quantifying the ultimate limits of
L-orthogonal PSK signalling
This study quantified the maximum achievable capacity for a range of M -ary digital sig
nalling set for transmission over both AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels, in the quest for
more error-resilient, power-efficient and bandwidth-efficient channel coding schemes
As we have seen in Section 23.5 that it is beneficial to double the number of modulation
levels M from 2b to 2b+1, when aiming for a capacity of b bit/symbol in all the M ary
signalling schemes studied. In the forthcoming chapters, we will study a range of bandwidth
efficient coded modulation schemes based on both M -ary PSK and QAM signalling, where
the number of modulation levels is increased by introducing an extra parity bit in each of
the original b-bit information symbol. Since the L-orthogonal QAM signalling scheme was
shown in Section 23.5.6 to be more bandwidth efficient compared to the M -ary orthogonal
signalling and L-orthogonal PSK signalling schemes, as well as being more errorresilient
than the classic PSK and QAM schemes, future research might show the benefits of designing
coded modulation schemes based on the family of L-orthogonal QAM signalling scheme

24.1 Motivation
The objective of channel coding is to combat the effects of channel impairment and thereby
aid the receiver in its decision making process. The design of a good channel coding and
modulation scheme depends on a range of contradictory factors, some of which are portrayed
in Figure 24.1. Specifically, given a certain transmission channel, it is always feasible to
design a coding and modulation system which is capable of further reducing the Bit Error
Ratio (BER) and/or Frame Error Ratio (FER) achieved. The gain quantified in terms of the
bit energy reduction at a certain BER/FER, achieved by the employment of channel coding
with respect to the uncoded system is termed the coding gain. However, this implies further
investments in terms of the required implementational complexity and coding/interleaving de
lay as well as reducing the effective throughput. Different solutions accrue, when designing a
coding and modulation scheme, which aim for optimising different features. For example, in
a power-limited scenario, the system’s bandwidth can be extended for the sake of accommo
dating a low rate code. By contrast, the effective throughput of the system can be reduced for

the sake of absorbing more parity information. To elaborate further, in a bandwidthlimited
and power-limited scenario a more complex, but a higher coding gain code can be employed
The system’s effective throughput can be increased by increasing the coding rate at the cost
of sacrificing the achievable transmission integrity. The coding and modulation scheme’s de
sign also depends on the channel’s characteristics. More specifically, the associated bit and
frame error statistics change, when the channel exhibits different statistical characteristics
On the other hand, a joint channel coding and modulation scheme can be designed by
employing high rate channel coding schemes in conjunction with multidimensional or high
level modulation schemes. In this coded modulation scheme a coding gain may be achieved
without bandwidth expansion. In this part of the book a variety of coded modulation assisted
systems will be proposed and investigated in mobile wireless propagation environments
24.2 A Historical Perspective on Coded Modulation
The history of channel coding or Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding dates back to Shan
non’s pioneering work [356] in 1948, in which he showed that it is possible to design a
communication system with any desired small probability of error, whenever the rate of trans
mission is smaller than the capacity of the channel. While Shannon outlined the theory that
explained the fundamental limits imposed on the efficiency of communications systems, he
provided no insights into how to actually approach these limits. This motivated the search for
codes that would produce arbitrarily small probability of error. Specifically, Hamming
and Golay [358] were the first to develop practical error control schemes. Convolutional
codes [359] were later introduced by Elias in 1955, while Viterbi [360] invented a maxi
mum likelihood sequence estimation algorithm in 1967 for efficiently decoding convolutional
codes. In 1974, Bahl proposed the more complex Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) algorithm
which is capable of achieving the minimum achievable BER
The first successful application of channel coding was the employment of convolutional
codes [359] in deep-space probes in the 1970s. However, for years to come, error con
trol coding was considered to have limited applicability, apart from deep-space communica
tions. Specifically, this is a power-limited scenario, which has no strict bandwidth limitation
By contrast mobile communications systems constitute a power- and bandwidth-limited sce
nario. In 1987, a bandwidth efficient Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM) [361] scheme em
ploying symbol-based channel interleaving in conjunction with Set-Partitioning (SP)
assisted signal labelling was proposed by Ungerböck. Specifically, the TCM scheme, which
is based on combining convolutional codes with multidimensional signal sets, constitutes a
bandwidth efficient scheme that has been widely recognised as an efficient error control tech
nique suitable for applications in mobile communications [363]. Another powerful coded
modulation scheme utilising bit-based channel interleaving in conjunction with Gray signal
labelling, which is referred to as Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM), was proposed
by Zehavi [364] as well as by Caire, Taricco and Biglieri [365]. Another breakthrough in
the history of error control coding is the invention of turbo codes by Berrou, Glavieux and
Thitimajshima [366] in 1993. Convolutional codes were used as the component codes and
decoders based on the MAP algorithm were employed. The results proved that a performance
close to the Shannon limit can be achieved in practice with the aid of binary codes. The at
tractive properties of turbo codes have attracted intensive research in this area
766 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
As a result, turbo coding has reached a state of maturity within just a few years and was
standardised in the recently ratified third-generation (3G) mobile radio systems
However, turbo codes often have a low coding rate and hence require considerable band
width expansion. Therefore, one of the objectives of turbo coding research is the design of
bandwidth-efficient turbo codes. In order to equip the family of binary turbo codes with a
higher spectral efficiency, BICM-based Turbo Coded Modulation (TuCM) [371] was pro
posed in 1994. Specifically, TuCM uses a binary turbo encoder, which is linked to a signal
mapper, after its output bits were suitably punctured and multiplexed for the sake of trans
mitting the desired number of information bits per transmitted symbol. In the TuCM scheme
of [371] Gray-coding based signal labelling was utilised. For example, two 1/2-rate Recursive
Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes are used for generating a total of four turbo coded bits
and this bit stream may be punctured for generating three bits, which are mapped to an PSK
modulation scheme. By contrast, in separate coding and modulation scheme, any modulation
schemes for example BPSK, may be used for transmitting the channel coded bits. Finally
without puncturing, 16QAM transmission would have to be used for maintaining the original
transmission bandwidth. Turbo Trellis Coded Modulation (TTCM) [372] is a more recently
proposed channel coding scheme that has a structure similar to that of the family of turbo
codes, but employs TCM schemes as its component codes. The TTCM symbols are transmit
ted alternatively from the first and the second constituent TCM encoders and symbolbased
interleavers are utilised for turbo interleaving and channel interleaving. It was shown in
that TTCM performs better than the TCM and TuCM schemes at a comparable complexity
In 1998, iterative joint decoding and demodulation assisted BICM referred to as BICMID
was proposed in [373, 374], which uses SP based signal labelling. The aim of BICM-ID is
to increase the Euclidean distance of BICM and hence to exploit the full advantage of bit in
terleaving with the aid of soft-decision feedback based iterative decoding [374]. Many other
bandwidth efficient schemes using turbo codes have been proposed in the literature [368], but
we will focus our study on TCM, BICM, TTCM and BICM-ID schemes in the context of
wireless channels in this part of the book
The radio spectrum is a scarce resource. Therefore, one of the most important objectives
in the design of digital cellular systems is the efficient exploitation of the available spectrum
in order to accommodate the ever-increasing traffic demands. Trellis-Coded Modulation
(TCM) [496], which will be detailed in Section 24.3, was proposed originally for Gaussian
channels, but it was further developed for applications in mobile communications
Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation (TTCM) [709], which will be augmented in Section
is a more recent joint coding and modulation scheme that has a structure similar to that of
the family of power-efficient binary turbo codes [366, 367], but employs TCM schemes as
component codes. TTCM [709] requires approximately 0.5 dB lower Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR) at a Bit Error Ratio (BER) of 10−4 than binary turbo codes when communicating us
ing 8PSK over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels. TCM and TTCM invoked
Set Partitioning (SP) based signal labelling, as will be discussed in the context of Figure
in order to achieve a higher Euclidean distance between the unprotected bits of the constella
tion, as we will show during our further discourse. It was shown in [496] that parallel trellis
transitions can be associated with the unprotected information bits; as we will augment in
Figure 24.3(b), this reduced the decoding complexity. Furthermore, in our TCM and TTCM
oriented investigations random symbol interleavers, rather than bit interleavers, were utilised
since these schemes operate on the basis of symbol, rather than bit, decisions
24.3. TRELLIS-CODED MODULATION
Another coded modulation scheme distinguishing itself by utilising bit-based interleaving
in conjunction with Gray signal constellation labelling is referred to as Bit-Interleaved Coded
Modulation (BICM) [364]. More explicitly, BICM combines conventional convolutional
codes with several independent bit interleavers, in order to increase the achievable diversity
order to the binary Hamming distance of a code for transmission over fading channels
as will be shown in Section 24.6.1. The number of parallel bit interleavers equals the num
ber of coded bits in a symbol for the BICM scheme proposed in [364]. The performance
of BICM is better than that of TCM over uncorrelated or perfectly interleaved narrowband
Rayleigh fading channels, but worse than that of TCM in Gaussian channels owing to the re
duced Euclidean distance of the bit-interleaved scheme [364], as will be demonstrated in Sec
tion 24.6.1. Recently iterative joint decoding and demodulation assisted BICM BICMID
was proposed in an effort to further increase the achievable performance
which uses SP-based signal labelling. The approach of BICM-ID is to increase the Euclidean
distance of BICM, as will be shown in Section 24.7, and hence to exploit the full advantage
of bit interleaving with the aid of soft-decision feedback-based iterative decoding
In this chapter we embark on studying the properties of the above-mentioned TCM
TTCM, BICM and BICM-ID schemes in the context of Phase Shift Keying (PSK) and
Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) schemes. Specifically, the code generator poly
nomials of 4-level QAM (4QAM) or Quadrature PSK (QPSK), 8-level PSK (8PSK), level
QAM (16QAM) and 64-level QAM (64QAM) will be given in Tables 24.1, 24.2, 24.3 and

24.3 Trellis-Coded Modulation
The basic idea of TCM is that instead of sending a symbol formed by m̄ information bits, for
example two information bits for 4PSK, we introduce a parity bit, while maintaining the same
effective throughput of 2 bits/symbol by doubling the number of constellation points in the
original constellation to eight, i.e. by extending it to 8PSK. As a consequence, the redundant
bit can be absorbed by the expansion of the signal constellation, instead of accepting a
increase in the signalling rate, i.e. bandwidth. A positive coding gain is achieved when
the detrimental effect of decreasing the Euclidean distance of the neighbouring phasors is
outweighted by the coding gain of the convolutional coding incorporated
has written an excellent tutorial paper [361], which fully describes TCM, and which this
section is based upon. TCM schemes employ redundant non-binary modulation in combi
nation with a finite state Forward Error Control (FEC) encoder, which governs the selection
of the coded signal sequences. Essentially the expansion of the original symbol set absorbs
more bits per symbol than required by the data rate, and these extra bit(s) are used by a
convolutional encoder which restricts the possible state transitions amongst consecutive pha
sors to certain legitimate constellations. In the receiver, the noisy signals are decoded by a
trellis-based soft-decision maximum likelihood sequence decoder. This takes the incoming
data stream and attempts to map it onto each of the legitimate phasor sequences allowed by
the constraints imposed by the encoder. The best fitting symbol sequence having the mini
mum Euclidean distance from the received sequence is used as the most likely estimate of the
transmitted sequence
Simple four-state TCM schemes, where the four-state adjective refers to the number
768 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
of possible states that the encoder can be in, are capable of improving the robustness of
8PSK-based TCM transmission against additive noise in terms of the required SNR by dB
compared to conventional uncoded 4PSK modulation. With the aid of more complex TCM
schemes the coding gain can reach 6 dB [361]. As opposed to traditional error correction
schemes, these gains are obtained without bandwidth expansion, or without the reduction
of the effective information rate. Again, this is because the FEC encoder’s parity bits are
absorbed by expanding the signal constellation in order to transmit a higher number of bits
per symbol. The term ‘trellis’ is used, because these schemes can be described by a state
transition diagram similar to the trellis diagrams of binary convolutional codes [714]. The
difference is that in the TCM scheme the trellis branches are labelled with redundant non
binary modulation phasors, rather than with binary code symbols
24.3.1 TCM Principle
We now illustrate the principle of TCM using the example of a four-state trellis code for
8PSK modulation, since this relatively simple case assists us in understanding the principles
involved
The partitioned signal set proposed by [361, 496] is shown in Figure 24.2, where the
binary phasor identifiers are now not Gray encoded. Observe in the figure that the Euclidean
distance amongst constellation points is increased at every partitioning step. The underlined
last two bits, namely bit 0 and bit 1, are used for identifying one of the four partitioned sets
while bit 2 finally pinpoints a specific phasor in each partitioned set
The signal sets and state transition diagrams for (a) uncoded 4PSK modulation and b
coded 8PSK modulation using four trellis states are given in Figure 24.3, while the corre
sponding four-state encoder-based modulator structure is shown in Figure 24.4. Observe that
after differential encoding bit 2 is fed directly to the 8PSK signal mapper, whilst bit 1 is
half-rate convolutionally encoded by a two-stage four-state linear circuit. The convolutional
encoder adds the parity bit, bit 0, to the sequence, and again these two protected bits are used
for identifying which constellation subset the bits will be assigned to, whilst the more widely
spaced constellation points will be selected according to the unprotected bit
The trellis diagram for 4PSK is a trivial one-state trellis, which portrays uncoded PSK
from the viewpoint of TCM. Every connected path through the trellis represents a legitimate
signal sequence where no redundancy-related transition constraints apply. In both systems
starting from any state, four transitions can occur, as required for encoding two bitssymbol
The four parallel transitions in the state trellis diagram of Figure 24.3(a) do not restrict the
sequence of 4PSK symbols that can be transmitted, since there is no channel coding and
therefore all trellis paths are legitimate. Hence the optimum detector can only make nearest
phasor-based decisions for each individual symbol received. The smallest distance between
the 4PSK phasors is

2, denoted as d0, and this is termed the free distance of the uncoded
4PSK constellation. Each 4PSK symbol has two nearest neighbours at this distance. Each
phasor is represented by a two-bit symbol and transitions from any state to any other state are
legitimate
The situation for 8PSK TCM is a little less simplistic. The trellis diagram of Fig
ure 24.3(b) is constituted by four states according to the four possible states of the shift
register encoder of Figure 24.4, which we represent by the four vertically stacked bold nodes

lutional encoder’s shift register is clocked. This event is characterised by a transition in the
trellis from state Sn to state Sn+1, tracking one of the four possible paths corresponding to
the four possible input symbols
In the four-state trellis of Figure 24.3(b) associated with the 8PSK TCM scheme, the trel
lis transitions occur in pairs and the states corresponding to the bold nodes are represented
by the shift-register states S0n and S

n in Figure 24.4. Owing to the limitations imposed by
the convolutional encoder of Figure 24.4 on the legitimate set of consecutive symbols only
a limited set of state transitions associated with certain phasor sequence is possible. These
limitations allow us to detect and to reject illegitimate symbol sequences, namely those which
were not legitimately produced by the encoder, but rather produced by the error-prone chan
nel. For example, when the shift register of Figure 24.4 is in state (0,0), only the transitions
to the phasor points (0,2,4,6) are legitimate, whilst those to phasor points (1,3,5,7) are illegit
imate. This is readily seen, because the linear encoder circuit of Figure 24.4 cannot produce

Figure 24.3(b) that the underlined bit 1 and bit 0 identify four twin-phasor subsets, where
the phasors are opposite to each other in the constellation and hence have a high intrasubset

There are other possible codes, which would result in for example four distinct transitions
from each state to all possible successor states, but the one selected here proved to be the
most effective [361]. Within the 8PSK constellation we have the following distances: d0
2 sin(π/8), d1

2 and d2 = 2. The 8PSK signals are assigned to the transitions in the
four-state trellis in accordance with the following rules
1) Parallel trellis transitions are associated with phasors having the maximum possible
distance, namely (d2), between them, which is characteristic of phasor points in the
subsets (0,4), (1,5), (2,6) and (3,7). Since these parallel transitions belong to the same
subset of Figure 24.3(b) and are controlled by the unprotected bit 2, symbols associated
with them should be as far apart as possible
2) All four-state transitions originating from, or merging into, any one of the states are
labelled with phasors having a distance of at least d1

2 between them. These are
the phasors belonging to subsets (0,2,4,6) or
3) All 8PSK signals are used in the trellis diagram with equal probability
772 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
Observe that the assignment of bits to the 8PSK constellation of Figure 24.3(b) does not
obey Gray coding and hence adjacent phasors can have arbitrary Hamming distances between
them. The bit mapping and encoding process employed was rather designed for exploiting
the high Euclidean distances between sets of points in the constellation. The underlined bit
and bit 0 of Figure 24.3(b) representing the convolutional codec’s output are identical for
all parallel branches of the trellis. For example, the branches labelled with phasors 0 and
between the identical consecutive states of (0,0) and (0,0) are associated with (bit 1)=0 and
(bit 0)=0, while the uncoded bit 2 can be either ‘0’ or ‘1’, yielding the phasors 0 and 4, re
spectively. However, owing to appropriate code design this unprotected bit has the maximum
protection distance, namely d2 = 2, requiring the corruption of phasor 0 into phasor 4, in
order to inflict a single bit error in the position of bit

Figure 24.5: Diverging trellis paths for the computation of dfree. The parallel paths labelled by the
symbols 0 and 4 are associated with the uncoded bits ‘0’ and ‘1’, respectively, as well as
with the farthest phasors in the constellation of Figure b
The effect of channel errors exhibits itself at the decoder by diverging from the trellis
path encountered in the encoder. Let us consider the example of Figure 24.5, where the
encoder generated the phasors 0-0-0 commencing from state (0,0), but owing to channel
errors the decoder’s trellis path was different from this, since the phasor sequence 2-1-2 was
encountered. The so-called free distance of a TCM scheme can be computed as the lower one
of two distances. Namely, the Euclidean distances between the phasors labelling the parallel
branches in the trellis of Figure 24.3(b) associated with the uncoded bit(s), which is d2 =
in our example, as well as the distances between trellis paths diverging and remerging after
a number of consecutive trellis transitions, as seen in Figure 24.5 in the first and last of the
four consecutive (0,0) states. The lower one of these two distances characterises the error
resilience of the underlying TCM scheme, since the error event associated with it will be
the one most frequently encountered owing to channel effects. Specifically, if the received
24.3. TRELLIS-CODED MODULATION
phasors are at a Euclidean distance higher than half of the code’s free distance from the
transmitted phasor, an erroneous decision will be made. It is essential to ensure that by using
an appropriate code design the number of decoded bit errors is minimised in the most likely
error events, and this is akin to the philosophy of using Gray coding in a nontrelliscoded
constellation
The Euclidean distance between the phasors of Figure 24.3(b) associated with the par
allel branches is d2 = 2 in our example. The distance between the diverging trellis paths
of Figure 24.3(b) labelled by the phasor sequences of 0-0-0 and 2-1-2 following the states
{(0,0),(0,0),(0,0),(0,0)} and {(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,0)} respectively, portrayed in Figure
is inferred from Figure 24.3(b) as d1-d0-d1. By inspecting all the remerging paths of the
trellis in Figure 24.3(b) we infer that this diverging path has the shortest accumulated Free
Euclidean Distance (FED) that can be found, since all other diverging paths have higher ac
cumulated FED from the error-free 0-0-0 path. Furthermore, this is the only path having the
minimum free distance of

d21 + d

1. More specifically, the free distance of this TCM
sequence is given by
dfree = mind

d21 + d

Explicitly, since the term under the square root in Equation 24.1 is higher than d2 = 2, the
free distance of this TCM scheme is given ultimately by the Euclidean distance between the
parallel trellis branches associated with the uncoded bit 2, ie
dfree = 2.
The free distance of the uncoded 4PSK constellation of Figure 24.3(a) was d0

hence the employment of TCM has increased the minimum distance between the constella
tion points by a factor of g

= 2, which corresponds to 3 dB. There is
only one nearest-neighbour phasor at dfree = 2, corresponding to the π-rotated phasor in
Figure 24.3(b). Consequently the phasor arrangement can be rotated by π, whilst retaining
all of its properties, but other rotations are not admissible
The number of erroneous decoded bits induced by the diverging path 2-1-2 is seen from
the phasor constellation of Figure 24.3(b) to be 1-1-1, yielding a total of three bit errors. The
more likely event of a bit 2 error, which is associated with a Euclidean distance of d2 =
yields only a single bit error
Soft-decision-based decoding can be accomplished in two steps. The first step is known
as subset decoding, where within each phasor subset assigned to parallel transitions, i.e. to
the uncoded bit(s), the phasor closest to the received channel output in terms of Euclidean
distance is determined. Having resolved which of the parallel paths was more likely to have
been encountered by the encoder, we can remove the parallel transitions, hence arriving at
a conventional trellis. In the second step the Viterbi algorithm is used for finding the most
likely signal path through the trellis with the minimum sum of squared Euclidean distances
from the sequence of noisy channel outputs received. Only the signals already selected by
the subset decoding are considered. For a description of the Viterbi algorithm the reader is

24.3.2 Optimum TCM Codes
Ungerböck’s TCM encoder is a specific convolutional encoder selected from the family of
Recursive Systematic Convolutional (RSC) codes [496], which attaches one parity bit to each
information symbol. Only m̃ out of m̄ information bits are RSC encoded and hence only
2m̃ branches will diverge from and merge into each trellis state. When not all information
bits are RSC encoded, i.e. m̃ < m̄, 2m̄−m̃ parallel transitions are associated with each of
the 2m̃ branches. Therefore a total of 2m̃ × 2m̄−m̃ = 2m̄ transitions occur at each trellis
stage. The memory length ν of a code defines the number of shift-register stages in the
encoder. Figure 24.6 shows the TCM encoder using an eight-state Ungerböck code

ping of bits to the constellation points was highlighted in Figure
which has a high FED for the sake of attaining a high performance over AWGN channels
It is a systematic encoder, which attaches an extra parity bit to the original 2-bit information
word. The resulting 3-bit codewords generated by the 2-bit input binary sequence are then
interleaved by a symbol interleaver in order to disperse the bursty symbol errors induced by
the fading channel. Then, these 3-bit codewords are modulated onto one of the 23 =
possible constellation points of an 8PSK modulator
The connections between the information bits and the modulo-2 adders, as shown in
Figure 24.6, are given by the generator polynomials. The coefficients of these polynomials
are defined as

where D represents the delay due to one register stage. The coefficient hji takes the value of

polynomial H0(D) is the feedback generator polynomial and H j(D) for j ≥ 1 is the gener
ator polynomial associated with the jth information bit. Hence, the generator polynomial of

Ungerböck suggested [496] that all feedback polynomials should have coefficients h0ν
h00 = 1. This guarantees the realisability of the encoders shown in Figures 24.4 and
Furthermore, all generator polynomials should also have coefficients hjν = h

This ensures that at time n the input bits of the TCM encoder have no influence on the
parity bit to be generated, nor on the input of the first binary storage element in the encoder
Therefore, whenever two paths diverge from or merge into a common state in the trellis, the
parity bit must be the same for these transitions, whereas the other bits differ in at least one
bit [496]. Phasors associated with diverging and merging transitions therefore have at least
a distance of d1 between them, as we can see from Figure 24.3(b). Table 24.1 summarises
the generator polynomials of some TCM codes, which were obtained with the aid of an
exhaustive computer search conducted by Ungerböck [361], where m̃ (≤ m̄) indicates the
number of information bits to be encoded, out of the m̄ information bits in a symbol
24.3.3 TCM Code Design for Fading Channels
It was shown in Section 24.3.1 that the design of TCM for transmission over AWGN chan
nels is motivated by the maximisation of the FED, dfree. By contrast, the design of TCM
concerned for transmission over fading channels is motivated by minimising the length of
the shortest error event path and the product of the branch distances along that particular
path

where C is a constant that depends on the weight distribution of the code, which quantifies the
number of trellises associated with all possible Hamming distances measured with respect to
the all-zero path [370]. The variable B in Equation 24.5 is the number of binary input bits of
the TCM encoder during each transmission interval, i.e the information bits per symbol, while
K̄ is the Rician fading parameter [370] and Es/N0 is the channel’s symbol energy to noise
spectral density ratio. Furthermore, L is defined as the ‘length’ of the shortest error event path
in [718] or as the Effective Code Length (ECL) in [701,719] or as the code’s diversity in
Explicity, L is expressed as the number of erroneously decoded TCM symbols asociated with
the shortest error event path. Note that, in conventional TCM each trellis branch is labelled
by one TCM symbol. Therefore, L can be expressed as the number of trellis branches having
erroneously decoded symbol, in the shortest error event path. Most of the time, L is equal
to the number of trellis branches on this path. It is clear from Equation 24.5 that Pb varies
inversely proportionally with (Es/N0)L and this ratio can be increased by increasing the
code’s diversity [708]. More specifically, in [718], the authors pointed out that the shortest
error event paths are not necessarily associated with the minimum accumulated FED error
events. For example, let the all-zero path be the correct path. Then the code characterised by
the trellis seen in Figure 24.7 exhibits a minimum squared FED of
d2free = d

1 + d

0 + d


= 4.585,
from the 0-0-0 path associated with the transmission of three consecutive 0 symbols from the
path labelled with the transmitted symbols of 6-7-6. However, this is not the shortest error
event path, since its length is L = 3, which is longer than the path labelled with transmitted
symbols of 2-4, which has a length of L = 2 and a FED of d2free = d

1 + d

2 = 6. Hence, the
‘length’ of the shortest error event path is L = 2 for this code, which, again, has a squared
Euclidean distance of 6. In summary, the number of bit errors associated with the above
L = 3 and L = 2 shortest error event paths is seven and two, respectively, clearly favouring
the L = 2 path, which had a higher accumulated FED of 6 than that of the 4.585 FED of the
L = 3 path. Hence, it is worth noting that if the code was designed based on the minimum
FED, it may not minimise the number of bit errors. Hence, as an alternative design approach
in Section 24.6 we will study BICM, which relies on the shortest error event path L or the
bit-based Hamming distance of the code and hence minimises the BER
The design of coded modulation schemes is affected by a variety of factors. A high
squared FED is desired for AWGN channels, while a high ECL and a high minimum product
distance are desired for fading channels [708]. In general, a code’s diversity or ECL is quan
tified in terms of the length of the shortest error event path L, which may be increased for
example by simple repetition coding, although at the cost of reducing the effective data rate
proportionately. Alternatively, space-time-coded multiple transmitter/receiver structures can
be used, which increase the scheme’s cost and complexity. Finally, simple interleaving can
be invoked, which induces latency. In our approach, symbol-based interleaving is employed

24.3.4 Set Partitioning
As we have seen in Figure 24.5, if higher-order modulation schemes, such as 16QAM or
64QAM, are used, parallel transitions may appear in the trellis diagram of the TCM scheme
when not all information bits are convolutional channel encoded or when the number of
states in the convolutional encoder has to be kept low for complexity reasons. As noted
before, in order to avoid encountering high error probabilities, the parallel transitions should
be assigned to constellation points exhibiting a high Euclidean distance. Ungerböck solved
this problem by introducing the set partitioning technique. Specifically, the signal set is split
into a number of subsets, such that the minimum Euclidean distance of the signal points in
the new subset is increased at every partitioning step
In order to elaborate a little further, Figure 24.8 illustrates the set partitioning of QAM
Here we used the R = 34 -rate code of Table 24.1. This is a relatively high-rate code, which
would not be sufficiently powerful if we employed it for protecting all three original infor
mation bits. Moreover, if we protect for example two out of the three information bits, we
can use a more potent 23 -rate code for the protection of the more vulnerable two informa

tion bits and leave the most error-resilient bit of the 4-bit constellation unprotected. This is
justifiable, since we can observe in Figure 24.8 that the minimum Euclidean distance of the
constellation points increases from Level 0 to Level 3 of the constellation partitioning tree
This indicates that the bits labelling or identifying the specific partitions have to be protected
by the RSC code, since they label phasors that have a low Euclidean distance. By contrast
the intra-set distance at Level 3 is the highest, suggesting a low probability of corruption
Hence the corresponding bit, bit 3, can be left unprotected. The partitioning in Figure
can be continued, until there is only one phasor or constellation point left in each subset
The intra-subset distance increases as we traverse down the partition tree. The first partition
level, Level 0, is labelled by the parity bit, and the next two levels by the coded bits. Finally
the uncoded bit labels the lowest level, Level 3, in the constellation, which has the largest
minimum Euclidean distance
Conventional TCM schemes are typically decoded/demodulated with the aid of the ap
24.4. THE SYMBOL-BASED MAP ALGORITHM
propriately modified Viterbi Algorithm (VA) [720]. Furthermore, the VA is a maximum
likelihood sequence estimation algorithm, which does not guarantee that the Symbol Error
Ratio (SER) is minimised, although it achieves a performance near the minimum SER. By
contrast, the symbol-based MAP algorithm [709] guarantees the minimum SER, albeit at
the cost of a significantly increased complexity. Hence the symbol-based MAP algorithm
has been used for the decoding of TCM sequences. We will, however, in Section 24.5, also
consider Turbo TCM (TTCM), where instead of the VA-based sequence estimation, symbol
by-symbol-based soft information has to be exchanged between the TCM decoders of the
TTCM scheme. Hence in the next section we will present the symbol-based MAP algorithm
24.4 The Symbol-based MAP Algorithm
In this section, the non-binary or symbol-based Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP) decoding al
gorithm will be presented. The binary MAP algorithm was first presented in [583], while
the non-binary MAP algorithm was proposed in [709]. A reduced-complexity version of
the MAP algorithm, operating in the logarithmic domain (log-domain) after transforming the
operands and the operations to this domain will also be presented. In our forthcoming dis
course we use p(x) to denote the probability of the event x, and, given a symbol sequence
yk, we denote by yba the sequence of symbols given by ya, ya+1, . . . , yb
24.4.1 Problem Description
The problem that the MAP algorithm has to solve is presented in Figure 24.9. An infor
mation source produces a sequence of N information symbols uk, k = 1, 2, . . . , N . Each
information symbol can assume M different values, i.e. uk ∈ {0, 1, . . . ,M − 1}, where M
is typically a power of two, so that each information symbol carries m̄ = log2M information
bits. We assume here that the symbols are to be transmitted over an AWGN channel. To this
end, the m̄-bit symbols are first fed into an encoder for generating a sequence of N channel
symbols xk ∈ X , where X denotes the set of complex values belonging to some phasor
constellations such as an increased-order QAM or PSK constellation, having M possible val
ues carrying m = log2M bits. Again, the channel symbols are transmitted over an AWGN
channel and the received symbols are
yk = xk + nk,
where nk represents the complex AWGN samples. The received symbols are fed to the
decoder, which has the task of producing an estimate ûk of the 2m̄-ary information sequence
based on the 2m-ary received sequence, where m > m̄. If the goal of the decoder is that
of minimising the number of symbol errors, where a symbol error occurs when uk 6= uk
then the best decoder is the MAP decoder [583]. This decoder computes the A Posteriori
Probability (APP) Ak,m for every 2m̄-ary information symbol uk that the information symbol
value was m given the received sequence, i.e. computes Ak,m = p(uk = m|yN1 ), for m
0, 1, . . . ,M − 1, k = 1, 2, . . . , N . Then it decides that the information symbol was the one
having the highest probability, i.e. ûk = m if Ak,m ≥ Ak,i for i = 0 . . . M − 1. In order to
realise a MAP decoder one has to devise a suitable algorithm for computing the APP
780 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
Encoder Channel Decoder
ûkuk xk yk
Figure 24.9: The transmission system
In order to compute the APP, we must specify how the encoder operates. We consider a
trellis encoder. The operation of a trellis encoder can be described by its trellis. The trellis
seen in Figure 24.10, is constituted by (N + 1) · S nodes arranged in (N + 1) columns
of S nodes. There are M branches emerging from each node, which arrive at nodes in the
immediately following column. The trellis structure repeats itself identically between each
pair of columns
It is possible to identify a set of paths originating from the nodes in the first column and
terminating in a node of the last column. Each path will comprise exactly N branches. When
employing a trellis-encoder, the input sequence unambiguously determines a single path in
the trellis. This path is identified by labelling the M branches emerging from each node by
the M possible values of the original information symbols, although only the labelling of the
first branch at m = 0 and the last branch at m = M − 1 are shown in Figure 24.10 due to
space limitations. Then, commencing from a specified node in the first column, we use the
first input symbol, u1, to decide which branch is to be chosen. If u1 = m, we choose the
branch labeled with m, and move to the corresponding node in the second column that this
branch leads to. In this node we use the second information symbol, u2, for selecting a further
branch and so on. In this way the information sequence identifies a path in the trellis. In order
to complete the encoding operation, we have to produce the symbols to be transmitted over
the channel, namely x1, x2, . . . , xN from the information symbols u1, u2, . . . , uN . To this
end we add a second label to each branch, which is the corresponding phasor constellation
point that is transmitted when the branch is encountered
In a trellis it is convenient to attach a time index to each column, from 0 to N , and to
number the nodes in each column from 0 to S − 1. This allows us to introduce the concept
of trellis states at time k. Specifically, during the encoding process, we say that the trellis
is in state i at time k, and write sk = i, if the path determined by the information sequence
crosses the i-th node of the k-th column. The structure of a trellis encoder is specified by two
functions. The first function is N(j,m) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , S − 1}, which specifies the trellis’ next
state, namely sk = N(j,m), when the information symbol is uk = m and the previous state
is sk−1 = j as seen in Figure 24.10. In order to specify the symbol transmitted when this
branch is encountered, we use the function L(j,m) ∈ X . To summarize, there is a branch
leading from state sk−1 = j to state sk = N(j,m), which is encountered if the input symbol
is uk = m, and the corresponding transmitted symbol is L(j,m). It is useful to consider a
third function, P (i,m) ∈ {0, 1, . . . , S − 1} specifying the previous state sk−1 = P (i,m) of
the trellis when the present state is sk = i, and the last original information symbol is uk = m
as seen in Figure 24.10. The aim of the MAP decoding algorithm is to find the path in the
trellis that is associated with the most likely transmitted symbols, i.e. that of minimising

24.4.2 Detailed Description of the Symbol-based MAP Algorithm
Having described the problem to be solved by the MAP decoder and the encoder structure
we now seek an algorithm capable of computing the APP, i.e. Ak,m = p(uk = m|yN1 ). The
easiest way of computing these probabilities is by determining the sum of a different set of
probabilities, namely p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 ), where again, yN1 denotes the symbol
sequence y1, y2, . . . , yN . This is because we can devise a recursive way of computing the
second set of probabilities, as we traverse through the trellis from state to state which reduces
782 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
the detection complexity. Thus we write
Ak,m = p(uk = m|yN1 )
S

ij
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 ),
where the summation implies adding all probabilities associated with the nodes j and i la
beled by uk = m and the problem is now that of computing p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1
j|yN1 ). As a preliminary consideration we note that this probability is zero, if the specific
branch of the trellis emerging from state j and merging into state i is not labeled with the
input symbol m. Hence, we can eliminate the corresponding terms of the summation. Thus
upon denoting the specific set of pairs i, j, by Im for which a trellis branch labeled with m
exists that traverses from state j to state i, we can rewrite Equation 24.8 as
Ak,m

ijIm
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 ).
If i, j ∈ Im, then we can compute the probabilities p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1
as [583,
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 )

γk(j,m) = p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = j).
In order to simplify our discourse, we defer the proof of Equation 24.10 to Section
where we also show how the αk−1(j) values and the βk(i) values can be efficiently computed
using the γk(j,m) values. In our forthcoming discourse we study the γk(j,m) values and
further simplify Equation
The first simplification is to note that we do not necessarily need the exact Ak,m values
but only their ratios. In fact, for a fixed k, the vector Ak,m, being a probability vector, must
sum to unity. Thus, by normalising the sum in Equation 24.9 to unity, we can compute the
exact value of Ak,m from Āk,m with the aid of
Āk,m = Ck ·Ak,m.
For this reason we will omit the common normalisation factor of Ck = 1p(yN1
in Equation
24.10. Then, upon substituting Equation 24.10 into Equation 24.9 we have
Āk,m

ijIm
βk(i) · αk−1(j) · γk(j,m).
A second simplification is to note that in Equation 24.13 the value of i is uniquely specified
by the pair j and m, since i, j ∈ Im. Specifically, since i is the state reached after emerging
24.4. THE SYMBOL-BASED MAP ALGORITHM
from state j when the input symbol is m, we have i = N(j,m) where N(j,m) was defined
at the end of Section 24.4.1. Thus we can rewrite 1 Equation 24.13 as
Āk,m
S

j
βk(N(j,m)) · αk−1(j) · γk(j,m).
Before we proceed, it is worth presenting Bayes’ rule, which is applied repeatedly
throughout this section. This rule gives the joint probability of “a and b”, P (a, b), in terms of
the conditional probability of “a given b”, P (a|b), as
P (a, b) = P (a|b) · P (b) = P (b|a) · P (a).
Two useful consequences of Bayes’ rule are
P (a, b, c) = P (a|b, c) · P (b, c)
and
P (a, b|c) = P (a, b, c

= P (a|b, c).P (b|c).
Let us now consider the term γk(j,m) = p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = j) of Equation
which can be rewritten using the relationship of Equation 24.17 as
γk(j,m) = p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = j) = p(yk|uk = m, sk−1 = j) · p(uk = m|sk−1 = j

Let us now study the multiplicative terms at the right of Equation 24.18, where p(yk|uk
m, sk−1 = j) is the probability that we receive yk, when the branch emerging from state
sk−1 = j of Figure 24.10 labeled with the information symbol uk = m is encountered. When
this branch is encountered, the symbol transmitted is xk = L(j,m), as seen in Figure
Thus, the probability of receiving the sample yk, given that the previous state was sk−1 = j
and the transition symbol encountered was uk = m can be written as
p(yk|uk = m, sk−1 = j) = p(yk|xk = L(j,m)) = ηk(j,m).
By remembering that yk = xk + nk, and that nk is the complex AWGN, we can compute
ηk(j,m) as
ηk(j,m) = e

where σ2 = N0/2 is the noise’s variance and N0 is the noise’s Power Spectral Density PSD
In verbal terms, Equation 24.20 indicates that the probability expressed in Equation 24.19 is
a function of the distance between the received noisy sample yk and the transmitted noiseless
sample xk = L(j,m). Observe in Equation 24.20 that we dropped the multiplicative factor
of 12πσ2 , since it constitutes another scaling factor, which can be viewed as comprised in the
constant Ck associated with Āk,m = CkAk,m. As to the second multiplicative term at the
righthand side of Equation 24.18, note that p(uk = m|sk−1 = j) = p(uk = m), since
the original information to be transmitted is independent of the previous trellis state. The
probabilities
Πk,m = p(uk = m)
are the a priori probabilities of the information symbols. Typically the information symbols
are independent and equiprobable, hence Πk,m = 1/M . However, if we have some prior
knowledge about the transmitted symbols, this can be used as their a priori probability
As we will see, a turbo decoder will have some a priori knowledge about the transmitted
symbols after the first iteration. We now rewrite Equation 24.18 using Equation 24.19 and
the a priori probabilities as
γk(j,m) = Πk,m · ηk(j,m).
Then, by substituting Equation 24.22 into Equation 24.14 and exchanging the order of sum

called forward recursive variable and β is the so-called backward recursive variable. As the
first step of decoding, we have to compute all the values of γk using Equation 24.22, which
depend only on the current received symbol yk, for k = 1, · · · , N . Then, we can compute
αk−1 and βk based on these γk values with the aid of Equation
Now, we commence our discourse by considering the additive terms in Equation
which we formulated with the aids of Bayes’ rule in Equations 24.15 to 24.17 as
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 )

p(yN1
· p(yN1 , uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j),
and consider the term p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, yN1 ). We can write
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, y

= p(yNk+1|uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, yk1 ) · p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, yk1 ).
24.4. THE SYMBOL-BASED MAP ALGORITHM
Let us now simplify the first multiplicative term of Equation 24.25 by noting that if the cur
rent state sk is known, the decoded output sequence probability is not affected by either the
previous state sk−1, the input symbol uk or the previous received symbol sequence yk1 . Thus
Equation 24.25 can be rewritten as
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, y
N
1 ) = py
N
k+1|sk = i) · p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, yk1
= p(yNk+1|sk = i)·p(yk−11 |uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, yk)·p(yk, uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j

Again, we simplify the second multiplicative term of Equation 24.26 by noting that, if sk
is known, the received symbol sequence yk−11 is not affected by either sk, uk or yk, hence we
can rewrite Equation 24.26 as
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 ) = p(yNk+1|sk = i) · p(yk−11 |sk−1 = j) · p(yk, uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j

By multiplying and dividing the second and the third multiplicative term, respectively, with
p(sk−1 = j), we can rearrange Equation 24.27 to
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 ) = p(yNk+1|sk = i) · p(yk−11 sk−1 = j) · p(yk, uk = m, sk = i|sk−1 = j

Then, by introducing
βk(i) = py
N
k+1|sk = i)
and
αk−1(j) = py
k
1 , sk−1 = j)
we have
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j|yN1 ) = βk(i) · αk−1(j) · p(yk, uk = m, sk = i|sk−1 = j

If i, j /∈ Im, the above probability is zero, since no branch exists leading from state j to state
i, when the information symbol is m. Thus we assume i, j ∈ Im. In this case we can simplify
the second multiplicative term of Equation 24.31 as
p(yk, uk = m, sk = i|sk−1 = j) = p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = j).
Upon defining
γk(j,m) = p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = j)
and upon substituting Equation 24.32 and Equation 24.33 in Equation 24.31 we obtain
p(uk = m, sk = i, sk−1 = j, y
N
1 ) = βk(i) · αk−1(j) · γk(j,m),
and upon substituting Equation 24.34 in Equation 24.24 we obtain Equation 24.10, QED

24.4.3.1 Backward Recursive Computation of ki
Let us now highlight how the values βk(i) can be used, in order to ’backward’ recursively
compute βk−1(P (i,m) = j) from βk(i). With the aid of the definition in Equation 24.29 we
have
βk−1(j) = py
N
k |sk−1 = j) = p(yk, yNk+1|sk−1 = j),
which can be reformulated in terms of p(yk, yNk+1, sk = i|sk−1 = j), by summing these
probabilities for all the trellis states i = 0 . . . (S − 1), which are reached from sk−1 = j
yielding

With reference to the trellis diagram of Figure 24.10 we note that the received symbol se
quence yNk+1 is not affected by yk and sk−1, if sk is given. Thus from Equations 24.36,
and 24.15-24.17 we obtain

S

i
p(yNk+1|sk = i)·p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j)
S

βk(i)·p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j

Let us now consider the summation over the index range of i = 0 . . . (S−1), and note that for
a fixed j the probability p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j) will be non-zero only, if a branch exists that
leads from state j to state i. Thus there are only M specific values of i, which contribute to
the summation, namely the values of i = N(j,m) for some m. We can thus rewrite Equation
24.37 as
βk−1(j)
M

m
βk(N(j,m)) · p(yk, sk = N(j,m)|sk−1 = j),
where for the second multiplicative term we have p(yk, sk = N(j,m)|sk−1 = j)
p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = j) = γk(j,m). Hence we can write
βk−1(j)
M

m
βk(N(j,m))γk(j,m).
Equation 24.39 facilitates the ’backward’ recursive calculation of the βk(N(j,m) = i) val
ues, commencing from βN (N(j,m) = i). In order to determine this boundary value we note
24.4. THE SYMBOL-BASED MAP ALGORITHM
that by using Equation 24.39 for computing βN−1(j) we have
βN−1(j) = p(yN |sN−1 = j)

m
βN (N(j,m)) · p(yN , uN = m|sN−1 = j)
and that in order to render the above expression true we have to choose

24.4.3.2 Forward Recursive Computation of ki
In this section we recursively derive the values αk(N(j,m) = i) from αk−1(P (i,m) = j
Upon exploiting Equation 24.30 we have
αk(i) = py

We can compute the right-hand side form of Equation 24.42 using the probability

j = 0 . . . (S − 1), from which the state sk = i is reached, as follows
αk(i)

p(yk, y

This can be reformatted using Equations 24.15-24.17 as
αk(i)
S

j
p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j, yk−11 ) · p(yk−11 , sk−1 = j).
With reference to the trellis diagram of Figure 24.10 we note that the received symbol se
quence yk−11 has no effect on the first multiplicative term of Equation 24.43, if sk−1 is given
Thus from Equation 24.43 we obtain
αk(i)
S

j
p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j) · p(yk−11 , sk−1 = j
and with the aid of definition in Equation 24.30 we have
αk(i)
S

j
p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j) · αk−1(j).
Let us now consider the summation over the index range of j = 0 . . . (S − 1) and note that
for a fixed i, the probability of p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = j) will be non-zero only, if a branch
exists from state j to state i. Thus there are only M non-zero values of j, which contribute
to the summation in Equation 24.44, namely the values j = P (i,m) for a given m. We can
788 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
thus rewrite Equation 24.44 as
αk(i)
M

m
αk−1(P (i,m)) · p(yk, sk = i|sk−1 = P (i,m)).
For the second multiplicative term of Equation 24.45 we have p(yk, sk = i|sk−1
P (i,m)) = p(yk, uk = m|sk−1 = P (i,m)) = γk(P (i,m),m), hence we can write
αk(i)
M

m
αk−1(P (i,m)) · γk(P (i,m),m).
Equation 24.46 allows the recursive calculation of the αk−1(P (i,m) = j) values, commenc
ing from α0(j). In order to determine this boundary value we note that α0(j) = p(s0 = j
i.e. α0(j) is the a priori probability of the first state j leading to state i. Conventionally, we
commence the encoding from the first state, i.e. from state j = 0. In this case the boundary
conditions are
α0(j)

1 if j =
0 if j 6= 0
Let us now consider how the above recursive computations can be carried out more efficiently
in the logarithmic domain
24.4.4 The MAP Algorithm in the LogarithmicDomain
In this section we will describe the operation of the MAP algorithm in logarithmic do
main (log-domain). In 1995, Robertson proposed the Log-Map algorithm [638], which dra
matically reduces the complexity of the MAP algorithm, while attaining an identical perfor
mance to that of the MAP algorithm. The Max-Log-MAP algorithm constitutes a further
substantial simplification, which performs however suboptimally compared to the LogMAP
algorithm. Specifically, in the log-domain multiplications correspond to additions, which are
significantly less demanding in terms of computational complexity. A further simplification
accrues by using the Jacobian logarithm [638] as follows
g(Φ1,Φ2) = lne
Φ1 + e
= max{Φ1,Φ2}+ ln(1 + e
= max{Φ1,Φ2}+ fc(|Φ1 − Φ2|),
where the summation of eΦ1 + eΦ2 is replaced by selecting the maximum of the terms
and Φ2 and adding a correction term fc that depends on the Euclidean distance of both terms
For the summation of more than two terms, i.e. for example for the summations seen in
Equations 24.39 and 24.46, nesting of the g(Φ1,Φ2) terms in Equation 24.48 can be carried
out as follows
ln
I

i
eΦi) = g(ΦI , g(ΦI−1, . . . g(Φ3, g(Φ2,Φ1)) . . .)).
24.4. THE SYMBOL-BASED MAP ALGORITHM
The correction term fc in Equation 24.48 can be determined with the aid of three different
methods
• The Exact-Log-MAP algorithm, which is characterised by calculating the exact value
of the correction term fc as
fc = ln(1 + e
−|Φ1+Φ2|).
The corresponding performance is identical to that of the MAP algorithm
• The Approx-Log-MAP algorithm invokes an approximation of the correction term fc
Robertson [638] found that a look-up table containing eight values for fc, ranging
between 0 and 5, gives practically the same performance as the Exact-Log-MAP algo
rithm
• The Max-Log-MAP algorithm, which retains only the maximum value in Equation
24.48, hence ignoring the correction term fc. However, the Approx-Log-MAP algo
rithm is only marginally more complex, than the Max-Log-MAP algorithm, although
it has a superior performance
For these reasons, our simulations have been carried out by employing the ApproxLogMAP
algorithm. Explicitly, an addition operation is substituted with an addition, a subtraction
a table look-up and a maximum-search operation according to Equation 24.48, when the
Approx-Log-MAP algorithm is employed
24.4.5 Symbol-based MAP Algorithm Summary
Let us now summarize the operations of the symbol-based MAP algorithm using Fig
ure 24.11. We assume that the a priori probabilities Πk(i) in Equation 24.21 were known
These are either all equal to 1/M or they are constituted by additional external information
The first step is to compute the set of probabilities ηk(i,m) from Equation 24.20 as
ηk(j,m) = e
ykLjm

2σ2 .
From these and the a priori probabilities, the γk(i,m) values are computed according to
Equation 24.22 as
γk(j,m) = Πk,m · ηk(j,m).
The above values are then used to recursively compute the values αk−1(j) employing Equa
tions 24.46 and 24.47 as
αk(i)
M

m
αk−1(P (i,m)) · γk(P (i,m),m),
and the values βk(i) using Equations 24.39 and 24.41 as

Finally, the APP can be obtained using Equation
Āk,m = Πk,m

βk(N(j,m)) · αk−1(j) · ηk(j,m).
When considering the implementation of the MAP algorithm, one can opt for computing
and storing the ηk(j,m) values, and use these values together with the a priori probabilities
for determining the values γk(j,m) during decoding. In order to compute the probabilities
ηk(j,m) it is convenient to separately evaluate the exponential function of Equation
for every k and for every possible value of the transmitted symbol. As described in Section
24.4.1, a sequence of N information symbols was produced by the information source and
each information symbol can assume M possible values, while the number of encoder states
is S. There are M = 2 · M possible transmitted symbols, since the size of the original
signal constellation was doubled by the trellis encoder. Thus N · 2 ·M evaluations of the
exponential function of Equation 24.51 are needed. Using the online computation of the
γk(j,m) values, two multiplications are required for computing one additive term in each of
Equation 24.53 and 24.54, and there are N ·S terms to be computed, each requiring M terms
to be summed. Hence 2 · N · M · S multiplications and N ·M · S additions are required
for computing the forward recursion α or the backward recursion β. Approximately three
multiplications are required for computing each additive term in Equation 24.55, and there
are N ·M terms to be computed, each requiring S terms to be summed. Hence, the total
24.5. TURBO TRELLIS-CODED MODULATION
implementational complexity entails 7 ·N ·M · S multiplications, 3 ·N ·M · S summations
and N · 2 ·M exponential function evaluations, which is directly proportional to the length
N of the transmitted sequence, to the number of code states S and to the number of different
values M assumed by the input symbols
The computational complexity can be reduced by implementing the algorithm in the log
domain, where the evaluation of the exponential function in Equation 24.51 is avoided. The
multiplications and additions in Equations 24.52 to 24.55 are replaced by additions and Ja
cobian comparisons, respectively. Hence the total implementational complexity imposed is
7 ·N ·M · S additions and 3 ·N ·M · S Jacobian comparisons
When implementing the MAP decoder presented here it is necessary to control the dy
namic range of the likelihood terms computed in Equations 24.53 to 24.55. This is because
these values tend to become lower and lower due to the multiplication of small values. The
dynamic range can be controlled by normalising the sum of the αk(i) and the βk(i) values to
unity at every particular k symbol. The resulting symbol values will not be affected, since the
normalization only affects the scaling factors Ck in Equation 24.12. However, this problem
can be avoided, when the MAP algorithm is implemented in the logdomain
To conclude, let us note that the MAP decoder presented here is suitable for the decoding
of finite-length, preferably short, sequences. When long sequences are transmitted, the em
ployment of this decoder is impractical, since the associated memory requirements increase
linearly with the sequence-length. In this case the MAP decoder has to be modified. A MAP
decoder designed for long sequences was first presented in [723]. An efficient implementa
tion, derived by adapting the algorithm of [583], was proposed by Piazzo in [724]. Having
described the symbol-based MAP algorithm, let us now consider Turbo TCM (TTCM) and
the way it invokes the MAP procedure
24.5 Turbo Trellis-Coded Modulation
24.5.1 TTCM Encoder
It is worth describing the signal set dimensionality (D̄) [725, 726] before we proceed. For
a specific 2D̄ code, we have one 2D̄ symbol per codeword. For a general multidimensional
code having a dimensionality of D = 2 · n where n > 0 is an integer, one DD̄ codeword
is comprised of n 2D̄ sub-codewords. The basic concept of the multidimensional signal
mapping [725] is to assign more than one 2D̄ symbol to one codeword, in order to increase
the spectral efficiency, which is defined as the number of information bits transmitted per
channel symbol. For instance, a 2D̄ 8PSK TCM code seen in Table 24.2 maps n = D2 =
three-bit 2D̄ symbol to one 2D̄ codeword, where the number of information bits per D
codeword is m̄ = 2 yielding a spectral efficiency of m̄/n = 2 information bits per symbol
However, a 4D̄ 8PSK TCM code seen in Table 24.2 maps n = D2 = 2 three-bit 2D̄ symbols to
one six-bit 4D̄ codeword using the mapping rule of [725], where the number of information
bits per 4D̄ codeword is m̄ = 5, yielding a spectral efficiency of m̄/n = 2.5 information bits
per symbol. However, during our further discourse we only consider 2D̄ signal sets
Employing TTCM [709] avoids the obvious disadvantage of rate loss that one would incur
when applying the principle of parallel concatenation to TCM without invoking puncturing
Specifically, this is achieved by puncturing the parity information in a particular manner, so
that all information bits are sent only once, and the parity bits are provided alternatively by
792 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
the two component TCM encoders. The TTCM encoder is shown in Figure 24.12, which
comprises two identical TCM encoders linked by a symbol interleaver
Let the memory of the interleaver be N symbols. The number of modulated symbols per
block is N.n, where n = D2 is an integer and D is the number of dimensions of the signal
set. The number of information bits transmitted per block is N.m̄, where m̄ is the number of
information bits per symbol. The encoder is clocked at a rate of n.T , where T is the symbol
duration of each transmitted 2(m̄+1)/n-ary 2D̄ symbol. At each step, m̄ information bits are
input to the TTCM encoder and n symbols each constituted by m̄ + 1 bits are transmitted
yielding a coding rate of m̄m̄+1

Figure 24.12: Schematic of the TTCM encoder. The selector enables the transmission of the informa
tion bits only once and selects alternative parity bits from the constituent encoders seen
at the top and bottom [709] c©IEEE, 1998, Robertson and Worz
Each component TCM encoder consists of an Ungerböck encoder and a signal mapper
The first TCM encoder operates on the original input bit sequence, while the second TCM
encoder manipulates the interleaved version of the input bit sequence. The signal mapper
translates the codewords into complex symbols using the SP-based labelling method of Sec
tion 24.3.4. A complex symbol represents the amplitude and phase information passed to the
modulator in the system seen in Figure 24.12. The complex output symbols of the signal map
per at the bottom of Figure 24.12 are symbol de-interleaved according to the inverse opera
tion of the interleaver. Again, the interleaver and de-interleaver are symbol interleavers
Owing to invoking the de-interleaver of Figure 24.12 at the output of the component encoder
seen at the bottom, the TTCM codewords of both component encoders have identical infor
mation bits before the selector. Hence, the selector that alternatively selects the symbols of
the upper and lower component encoders is effectively a puncturer that punctures the parity
bits of the output symbols
The output of the selector is then forwarded to the channel interleaver, which is, again
another symbol interleaver. The task of the channel interleaver is to effectively disperse the
bursty symbol errors experienced during transmission over fading channels. This increases
the diversity order of the code [708, 718]. Finally, the output symbols are modulated and
transmitted through the channel
Table 24.2 shows the generator polynomials of some component TCM codes that can
be employed in the TTCM scheme. These generator polynomials were obtained by Robert
son and Wörz [709] using an exhaustive computer search of all polynomials and finding the
one that maximises the minimal Euclidean distance, taking also into account the alternative

of the code, ν denotes the code memory, 420 denotes the squared Euclidean distance of the
signal set itself and d2free denotes the squared FED of the TCM code
selection of parity bits for the TTCM scheme. In Table 24.2, m̃ denotes the number of in
formation bits to be encoded out of the total m̄ information bits in a symbol, 420 denotes
the squared Euclidean distance of the signal set itself, i.e. after TCM signal expansion, and
d2free denotes the squared FED of the TCM constituent codes, as defined in Section
Since d2free/420 > 0, the ‘punctured’ TCM codes constructed in Table 24.2 exhibit a positive
coding gain in comparison to the uncoded but expanded signal set, although not necessarily
in comparison to the uncoded and unexpanded original signal set. Nonetheless, the design
target is to provide a coding gain also in comparison to the uncoded and unexpanded original
signal set at least for the targeted operational SNR range of the system
Considering the 8PSK example of Table 24.2, where 420 = d28PSK applies, we have
dfreed

8PSK = 3. However, when we compare the ‘punctured’ 8PSK TCM codes to the
original uncoded QPSK, signal set we have dfreed

QPSK = d

free/2 = 0.878 [709], which
implies attaining a negative coding gain. However, when the iterative decoding scheme of
TTCM is invoked, we attain a significant positive coding gain, as we will demonstrate in the
following chapters
24.5.2 TTCM Decoder
The concept of a priori, a posteriori and extrinsic information is illustrated in Fig
ure 24.13. The associated concept is portrayed in more detail in Figure 24.14. The TTCM
decoder structure of Figure 24.14(b) is similar to that of binary turbo codes shown in Fig
ure 24.14(a), except that there is a difference in the nature of the information passed from one
decoder to the other and in the treatment of the very first decoding step. Specifically, each
decoder alternately processes its corresponding encoder’s channel-impaired output symbol
and then the other encoder’s channel-impaired output symbol
In a binary turbo coding scheme the component encoders’ output can be split into three
additive parts for each information bit uk at step k, when operating in the logarithmic or LLR
domain [638] as shown in Figure 24.14(a), which are

arrows apply only to one specific information bit for the binary turbo decoder, or a group
of m̄ information bits for the TTCM decoder [709] c©IEEE, 1998, Robertson and Worz
The interleavers/de-interleavers are not shown and the notations P, S, A and E denote
the parity information, systematic information, a priori probabilities and extrinsic
probabilities, respectively. Upper (lower) case letters represent the probabilities of the
upper (lower) component decoder
24.5. TURBO TRELLIS-CODED MODULATION
1) the systematic component (S/s), i.e. the corresponding received systematic value for
bit uk
2) the a priori or intrinsic component (A/a), i.e. the information provided by the other
component decoder for bit uk; and
3) the extrinsic information component related to bit uk (E/e), which depends not on
bit uk itself but on the surrounding bits
These components are impaired by independent noise and fading effects. In turbo codes, only
the extrinsic component should be passed on to the other component decoder, so that the
intrinsic information directly related to a bit is not reused in the other component decoder
[366]. This measure is necessary in turbo codes for avoiding the prevention of achieving
iterative gains, due to the dependence of the constituent decoders’ information on each other
However, in a symbol-based non-binary TTCM scheme the m̄ systematic information
bits and the parity bit are transmitted together in the same non-binary symbol. Hence, the
systematic component of the non-binary symbol, namely the original information bits, can
not be separated from the extrinsic component, since the noise and/or fading that affects
the parity component also affects the systematic component. Therefore, in this scenario the
symbol-based information can be split into only two components
1) the a priori component of a non-binary symbol (A/a), which is provided by the other
component decoder, and
2) the inseparable extrinsic as well as systematic component of a non-binary symbol
([E&S]/[e&s]), as can be seen from Figure b
Each decoder passes only the latter information to the next component decoder while the
a priori information is removed at each component decoder’s output, as seen in Fig
ure 24.14(b), where, again, the extrinsic and systematic components are inseparable
As described in Section 24.5.1, the number of modulated symbols per block is N ·n, with
n = D2 , where D is the number of dimensions of the signal set. Hence for a 2D̄ signal set
we have n = 1 and the number of modulated symbols per block is N . Therefore the symbol
interleaver of length N will interleave a block of N complex symbols. Let us consider D
modulation having a coding rate of m̄m̄+1 for the following example
The received symbols are input to the ‘Metric’ block of Figure 24.15, in order to gen
erate a set of M = 2m̄+1 symbol probabilities for quantifying the likelihood that a certain
symbol of the M-ary constellation was transmitted. The selector switches seen at the input of
the ‘Symbol by Symbol MAP’ decoder select the current symbol’s reliability metric, which
is produced at the output of the ‘Metric’ block, if the current symbol was not punctured by
the corresponding encoder. Otherwise puncturing will be applied where the probabilities of
the various legitimate symbols at index k are set to 1 or to 0 in the log-domain. The upper
(lower) case letters denote the set of probabilities of the upper (lower) component decoder, as
shown in the figure. The ‘Metric’ block provides the decoder with the inseparable parity and
systematic ([P&S] or [p&s]) information, and the second input to the decoder is the a priori
(A or a) information provided by the other component decoder. The MAP decoder then pro
vides the a posteriori (A + [E&S] or a + [e&s]) information at its output. Then A (or a
is subtracted from the a posteriori information, so that the same information is not used

(lower) case letters represent the probabilities of the upper (lower) component decoder
more than once in the other component decoder, since otherwise the component decoders
corresponding information would become dependent on each other, which would preclude
the achievement of iteration gains. The resulting [E&S or e&s] information is symbol in
terleaved (or de-interleaved) in order to present the a (or A) input for the other component
decoder in the required order. This decoding process will continue iteratively, in order to
offer an improved version of the set of symbol reliabilities for the other component decoder
One iteration comprises the decoding of the received symbols by both the component de
coders once. Finally, the a posteriori information of the lower component decoder will be
de-interleaved in order to extract m̄ decoded information bits per symbol. Hard decision
implies selecting the specific symbol which exhibits the maximum a posteriori probabil
ity associated with the m̄-bit information symbol out of the 2m̄ probability values. Having
described the operation of the symbol-based TTCM technique, which does not protect all
transmitted bits of the symbols, let us now consider bit-interleaved coded modulation as a
design alternative
24.6 Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation
Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) was proposed by [364] with the aim of increas
ing the diversity order of Ungerböck’s TCM schemes which was quantified in Section
24.6. BIT-INTERLEAVED CODED MODULATION
Again, the diversity order of a code is defined as the ‘length’ of the shortest error event path
expressed in terms of the number of trellis stages encountered, before remerging with the all
zero path [718] or, equivalently, defined as the minimum Hamming distance of the code
where the diversity order of TCM using a symbol-based interleaver is the minimum number
of different symbols between the erroneous path and the correct path along the shortest error
event path. Hence, in a TCM scenario having parallel transitions, as shown in Figure
the code’s diversity order is one, since the shortest error event path consists of one branch
This implies that parallel transitions should be avoided in TCM codes if it was possible, and
if there were no parallel branches, any increase in diversity would be obtained by increas
ing the constraint length of the code. Unfortunately no TCM codes exist where the parallel
transitions associated with the unprotected bits are avoided. In order to circumvent this prob
lem, Zehavi’s idea [364] was to render the code’s diversity equal to the smallest number of
different bits, rather than to that of the different channel symbols, by employing bitbased
interleaving, as will be highlighted below

The BICM encoder is shown in Figure 24.16. In comparison to the TCM encoder of Fig
ure 24.6, the differences are that BICM uses independent bit interleavers for all the bits of
a symbol and non-systematic convolutional codes, rather than a single symbol-based inter
leaver and systematic RSC codes protecting some of the bits. The number of bit interleavers
equals the number of bits assigned to the non-binary codeword. The purpose of bit interleav
ing is
• to disperse the bursty errors induced by the correlated fading and to maximise the
diversity order of the system
• to render the bits associated with a given transmitted symbol uncorrelated or indepen
dent of each other

forming the BICM encoder [364,728], where none of the bits are unprotected and instead
of the SP-based labelling as seen in Figure 24.2 here Gray labelling is employed
The interleaved bits are then grouped into non-binary symbols, where Gray-coded labelling
is used for the sake of optimising the performance of the BICM scheme. The BICM en
coder uses ’s non-systematic convolutional code proposed on page 331 of [728], which ex
hibits the highest possible free Hamming distance, hence attaining optimum performance
over Rayleigh fading channels. Figure 24.17 shows Paaske’s non-systematic eight-state code
of rate-2/3, exhibiting a free bit-based Hamming distance of four. The BICM decoder im

plements the inverse process, as shown in Figure 24.18. In the demodulator module six bit
metrics associated with the three bit positions, each having binary values of 0 and 1, are gen
erated from each channel symbol. These bit metrics are de-interleaved by three independent
bit de-interleavers, in order to form the estimated codewords. Then the convolutional de
coder of Figure 24.18 is invoked for decoding these codewords, generating the best possible
estimate of the original information bit sequence
From Equation 24.5 we know that the average bit error probability of a coded modulation
scheme using MPSK over Rayleigh fading channels at high SNRs is inversely proportional
to (Es/N0)L, where Es/N0 is the channel’s symbol energy to noise spectral density ratio
and L is the minimum Hamming distance or the code’s diversity order. When bit-based inter
leavers are employed in BICM instead of the symbol-based interleaver employed in TCM, the
minimum Hamming distance of BICM is quantified in terms of the number of different bits
between the erroneous path in the shortest error event and the correct path. Since in BICM
the bit-based minimum Hamming distance is maximised, BICM will give a lower bit error
24.6. BIT-INTERLEAVED CODED MODULATION
probability in Rayleigh fading channels than that of TCM that maximises the FED. Again
the design of BICM is aimed at providing maximum minimum Hamming distance, rather
than providing maximum FED, as in TCM schemes. Moreover, we note that attaining a max
imum FED is desired for transmission over Gaussian channels, as shown in Section
Hence, the performance of BICM is not as good as that of TCM in AWGN channels. The
reduced FED of BICM is due to the ‘random’ modulation imposed by the ‘random’ bit in
terleavers [364], where the m-bit BICM symbol is randomised by the m number of bit inter
leavers. Again, m̄ denotes the number of information bits, while m denotes the total number
of bits in a 2m-ary modulated symbol

Considering Paaske’s eight-state convolutional code [728] in Figure 24.19 as an example
the BICM encoding process is illustrated here. The corresponding generator polynomial is
shown in Equation 24.57. A two-bit information word, namely u = (u1, u0), is encoded in
each cycle in order to form a three-bit codeword, c = (c2, c1, c0). The encoder has three
shift registers, namely S0, S1 and S2, as shown in the figure. The three-bit binary contents
of these registers represent eight states, as follows
S = (S2, S1, S0) ∈ {000, 001, . . . , 111} = {0, 1, . . . , 7}.
The input sequence, u, generates a new state S and a new codeword c at each encoding

Table 24.5: The codeword generation and state transition table of the non-systematic convolutional
encoder of Figure 24.19. The state transition diagram is seen in Figure
cycle. Table 24.5 illustrates the codewords generated and the associated state transitions
The encoding process can also be represented with the aid of the trellis diagram of Fig
ure 24.20. Specifically, the top part of Table 24.20 contains the codewords c = (c2, c1, c
as a function of the encoder state S = (S2, S1, S0) as well as that of the information word
u = (u1, u0), while the bottom section contains the next states, again as a function of S
and u. For example, if the input is u = (u1, u0) = (1, 1) = 3 when the shift register is
in state S = (S2, S1, S0) = (1, 1, 0) = 6, the shift register will change its state to state
S = (S2, S1, S0) = (1, 1, 1) = 7 and c = (c2, c1, c0) = (0, 1, 0) = 2 will be the generated
codeword. Hence, if the input binary sequence is {01 10 01 00 10 10→} with the rightmost
being the first input bit, the corresponding information words are {1 2 1 0 2 2 →}. Before
any decoding takes place, the shift register is initialised to zero. Therefore, as seen at the
right of Figure 24.20, when the first information word of u1 = 2 arrives, the state changes
from S−1 = 0 to S = 4, generating the first codeword c1 = 6 as seen in the bottom and top
sections of Table 24.5, respectively. Then the second information word of u2 = 2 changes
the state from S−1 = 4 to S = 6, generating the second codeword of c2 = 2. The pro
cess continues in a similiar manner according to the transition table, namely Table 24.5. The
codewords generated as seen at the right of Figure 24.20 are {4 0 0 1 2 6 →}, and the state
transitions are {2 ← 4 ← 1 ← 2 ← 6 ← 4 ← 0}. Then the bits constituting the codeword
sequence are interleaved by the three bit interleavers of Figure 24.17, before they are assigned
to the corresponding 8PSK constellation points

24.7. BIT-INTERLEAVED CODED MODULATION WITH ITERATIVE DECODING
24.7 Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation with Iterative De
coding
BICM using Iterative Decoding (BICM-ID) was proposed by [373, 710] for further improv
ing the FED of Zehavi’s BICM scheme, although BICM already improved the diversity order
of Ungerböck’s TCM scheme. This FED improvement can be achieved with the aid of com
bining SP-based constellation labelling, as in TCM, and by invoking soft-decision feedback
from the decoder’s output to the demodulator’s input, in order to exchange softdecision
based information between them. As we will see below, this is advantageous, since upon
each iteration the channel decoder improves the reliability of the soft information passed to
the demodulator
24.7.1 Labelling Method
Let us now consider the mapping of the interleaved bits to the phasor constellation in this
section. Figure 24.21 shows the process of subset partitioning for each of the three bit posi
tions for both Gray labelling and in the context of SP labelling. The shaded regions shown
inside the circle correspond to the subset χ(i, 1) defined in Equation 24.64, and the unshaded
regions to χ(i, 0), i = 0, 1, 2, where i indicates the bit position in the three-bit BICMPSK
symbol. These are also the decision regions for each bit, if hard-decision-based BICM de
modulation is used for detecting each bit individually. The two labelling methods seen in
Figure 24.21 have the same intersubset distances, although a different number of nearest
neighbours. For example, χ(0, 1), which denotes the region where bit 0 equals to 1, is di
vided into two regions in the context of Gray labelling, as can be seen in Figure a
By contrast, in the context of SP labelling seen in Figure 24.21(b), χ(0, 1) is divided into
four regions. Clearly, Gray labelling has a lower number of nearest neighbours compared
to SP-based labelling. The higher the number of nearest neighbours, the higher the chances
for a bit to be decoded into the wrong region. Hence, Gray labelling is a more appropriate
mapping during the first decoding iteration, and hence it was adopted by the noniterative
BICM scheme of Figure
During the second decoding iteration in BICM-ID, given the feedback information repre
senting Bit 1 and Bit 2 of the coded symbol, the constellation associated with Bit 0 is confined
to a pair of constellation points, as shown at the right of Figure 24.22. Therefore, as far as
Bit 0 is concerned, the 8PSK phasor constellation is translated into four binary constellations
where one of the four possible specific BPSK constellations is selected by the feedback Bit
and Bit 2. The same is true for the constellations associated with both Bit 1 and Bit 2, given
the feedback information of the corresponding other two bits
In order to optimise the second-pass decoding performance of BICM-ID, one must max
imise the minimum Euclidean distance between any two points of all the 2m−1 = 4 possible
phasor pairs at the left (Bit 2), centre (Bit 1) and the right (Bit 0) of Figure 24.22. Clearly
SP-based labelling serves this aim better, when compared to Gray labelling, since the cor
responding minimum Euclidean distance of SP-based labelling is higher than that of Gray
labelling for both Bit 1 and Bit 2, as illustrated at the left and the centre of Figure
Although the first-pass performance is important, in order to prevent error precipitation due
to erroneous feedback bits, the error propagation is effectively controlled by the soft feedback
of the decoder. Therefore, BICM-ID assisted by soft decision feedback uses SP labelling

constellation for Bit i where Bit i = b ∈ {0, 1} [373] c©IEEE, 1999, Li and Ritcey
Specifically, the desired high Euclidean distance for Bit 2 in Figure 24.22(b) is only at
tainable when Bit 1 and Bit 0 are correctly decoded and fed back to the SP-based demod
ulator. If the values to be fed back are not correctly decoded, the desired high Euclidean
distance will not be achieved and error propagation will occur. On the other hand, an opti
mum convolutional code having a high binary Hamming distance is capable of providing a
high reliability for the decoded bits. Therefore, an optimum convolutional code using appro
priate signal labelling is capable of ‘indirectly’ translating the high binary Hamming distance
between coded bits into a high Euclidean distance between the phasor pairs portrayed in Fig
ure 24.22. In short, BICM-ID converts a 2m-ary signalling scheme to m independent parallel
binary schemes by the employment of m number of independent bit interleavers and involves
an iterative decoding method. This simultaneously facilitates attaining a high diversity order
with the advent of the bit interleavers, as well as achieving a high FED with the aid of the
iterative decoding and SP-based labelling. Hence, BICM-ID effectively combines powerful
binary codes with bandwidth-efficient modulation

24.7.2 Interleaver Design
The interleaver design is important as regards the performance of BICM-ID. In [711], Li
introduced certain constraints on the design of the interleaver, in order to maximise the mini
mum Euclidean distance between the two points in the 2m−1 possible specific BPSK constel
lations. However, we advocate a more simple approach, where the m number of interleavers
used for the 2m-ary modulation scheme are generated randomly and separately, without any
interactions between them. The resultant minimum Euclidean distance is less than that of the
scheme proposed in [711], but the error bursts inflicted by correlated fading are expected to
be randomised effectively by the independent bit interleavers. This was expected to give a
better performance over fading channels at the cost of a slight performance degradation over
AWGN channels, when compared to Li’s scheme [711]. However, as we will demonstrate in
the context of our simulation results in Section 25.2.2, our independent random interleaver
design and Li’s design perform similarly
806 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY

The BICM-ID scheme using soft-decision feedback is shown in Figure 24.23. The in
terleavers used are all bit-based, as in the BICM scheme of Figure 24.17, although for the
sake of simplicity here only one interleaver is shown. A Soft-Input Soft-Output (SISO)
decoder is used in the receiver module and the decoder’s output is fed back to the input of
the demodulator. The SISO decoder of the BICM-ID scheme is actually a MAP decoder that
computes the a posteriori probabilities for the non-systematically channel-coded bits and
the original information bits

and Es is the energy per transmitted symbol. In conjunction with a rate-2/3 code, the energy

yt = ρtxt + nt,
where ρt is the Rayleigh-distributed fading amplitude [370] having an expectation value of
E[ρ2t ] = 1, while nt is the complex AWGN exhibiting a variance of
2 = N0/2 where N0 is
the noise’s PSD. For AWGN channels we have ρt = 1 and the Probability Density Function

where i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, b ∈ {0, 1} and xt = µ(vt). Furthermore, the signal after the demodulator
of Figure 24.23 is described by the demapping of the bits [∇0(xt),∇1(xt),∇2(xt)] where
∇i(xt) ∈ {0, 1} is the value of the ith bit of the three-bit label assigned to xt. With the aid
of Bayes’ rule in Equations 24.15 to 24.17 we obtain
P (vit = b|yt)

P (yt|xt)P (xt),
where the subset χ(i, b) is described as
χ(i, b) = {µ([∇0(xt),∇1(xt),∇2(xt)]) | ∇j(xt) ∈ {0, 1}, j 6= i},
which contains all the phasors for which ∇i(xt) = b holds. For 8PSK, where m = 3, the
size of each such subset is 2m−1 = 4 as portrayed in Figure 24.21. This implies that only the
a priori probabilities of m − 1 = 2 bits out of the total of m = 3 bits per channel symbol
have to be considered, in order to compute the bit metric of a particular bit
Now using the notation of et al. [731], the a priori probabilities of an original uncoded
information bit at time index t and bit index i, namely uit being 0 and 1, are denoted by
P (uit = 0; I) and P u
i
t = 1; I) respectively, while I refers to the a prIori probabilities
808 CHAPTER 24. CODED MODULATION THEORY
of the bit. This notation is simplified to P (uit; I), when no confusion arises, as shown in
Figure 24.23. Similarly, P (cit; I) denotes the a priori probabilities of a legitimate coded bit
at time index t and position index i. Finally, P (uit;O) and P c
i
t;O) denote the extrinsic
a pOsteriori information of the original information bits and coded bits, respectively
The a priori probability P (xt) in Equation 24.63 is unavailable during the first-pass de
coding, hence an equal likelihood is assumed for all the 2m legitimate symbols. This renders
the extrinsic a posteriori bit probabilities, P (vit = b;O), equal to P v
i
t = b|yt), when
ignoring the common constant factors. Then, the SISO decoder of Figure 24.23(b) is used
for generating the extrinsic a posteriori bit probabilities P (uit;O) of the information bits
as well as the extrinsic a posteriori bit probabilities P (cit;O) of the coded bits, from the
de-interleaved probabilities P (vit = b;O), as seen in Figure 24.23(b). Since P u
i
t; I) is
unavailable, it is not used in the entire decoding process
During the second iteration P (cit;O) is interleaved and fed back to the input of the de
modulator in the correct order in the form of P (vit; I), as seen in Figure 24.23(b). Assuming
that the probabilities P (v0t ; I), P v

t ; I) and P v

t ; I) are independent by the employment of
three independent bit interleavers, we have for each xt ∈
P (xt) = P xtxtxt



j
P (vjt = ∇j(xt); I),
where ∇j(xt) ∈ {0, 1} is the value of the jth bit of the three-bit label for xt. Now that we
have the a priori probability P (xt) of the transmitted symbol xt, the extrinsic a posteriori
bit probabilities for the second decoding iteration can be computed using Equations 24.63 and
24.65, yielding
P (vit = b;O)
P (vit = byt
P (vit = b; I


xtib

P ytxt

j i
P (vjt = ∇j(xt); I


i ∈ {0, 1, 2}, b ∈ {0, 1}.
As seen from Equation 24.66, in order to recalculate the metric for a bit we only need the
a priori probabilities of the other two bits in the same channel symbol. After interleaving
in the feedback loop of Figure 24.23, the regenerated bit metrics are tentatively soft demod
ulated again and the process of passing information between the demodulator and decoder
is continued. The final decoded output is the hard-decision-based extrinsic bit probability
