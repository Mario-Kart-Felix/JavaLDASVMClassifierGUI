INTRODUCTIONLTHOUGH Business Intelligence BI has been developing for  over 20 years,  many organizations are notable to make from it the effective tool for decision making orcreating the competitive advantage 1, 2.  One of the reason of this fact is that they do not know a theoretical foundation how to diagnose measure BI using in organizations.So, the systematic and deliberate study on possibilities thatoffer BI for organizations and the ways of its assessment iscrucial. The research questions I ask in this study are  1what  possibilities  offer  BI  systems for  different  organizations, 2 how to measure and evaluate the BI maturity  inorganizations The study was based on 1 a critical analysis of literature, 2 a observation of different BI initiativesundertaken  in  various  organizations,  as  well  as  on  3semistructured interviews conducted in polish organizationsin  2012.  Some  interviews,  conducted  in  20  polish  enterprises, were held with over 80 responders executives, seniormembers of staff, and ICT specialists They represented theservice sector telecommunications T4, consulting C4,banking B4, insurance I4, marketing agencies MA4.AThe reminder of my paper is organized as follows. Firstly,the idea of BI is described. Next, the issue of BI maturitymodels is recognized. Finally,  Garters Model for BusinessIntelligence and Performance Management is used to assessthe level of BI maturity in surveyed organizations. The paper provides valuable information on the possibilities that offer BI systems for organizations and the ways oftheir  evaluation.  It  is  dedicated for  decisionmakers,  managers and ICT specialists interested in using BI systems inorganizations.  The study  makes useful contribution to theliterature and theorists on the idea of BI, BI using in organizations, and  the ways of its assessment.  II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORKS ON BUSINESSINTELLIGENCEA. The issue of Business IntelligenceFrom a historical perspective, Business Intelligence BIis a popularized, umbrella term introduced by Howard Dresner of the Gartner Group in 1989 to describe a set of concepts and methods to improve business decision making byusing factbased support systems 3. BI involves collecting,storing  and  presenting  data,  and  managing  knowledge  bymeans of employing different analytic tools. Intelligent dataanalysis is usually obtained by OLAP OnLine AnalyticalProcessing,  data  mining  and  data  warehouses  techniques 4. With the passing of time, the term BI has been understoodmuch more broadly, namely, as a connecting factor of different components of decision support infrastructure 5, andproviding comprehensive information for policy makers 6.Hence, many definitions of BI focus on the capability of anenterprise to improve  business efficiency and to  achievehigher business goals. It is said that BI provides a means toobtain crucial information to  improve strategic decisionsand, therefore,  plays an important role in current decisionsupport systems 7. The term Business Intelligence BI isoften used as a broad category of technologies, applications,and processes for gathering, storing, accessing, and analyzing data to help users make better decisions 8. More generally, BI can be understood as a process providing better insight in a company and its chain of actions. According to many authors there are distinguished 3 agesin the development of BI BI 1.0, BI 2.0, BI 3.0. The first age of BI, called BI 1.0. falls on seventies  andeighties  of XX century. It is closely related with the management information systems MIS, executive informationsystems EIS, and decision support systems DSS. Generally, the first applications from this age were dedicated onCelina M. OlszakUniversity of Economics in Katowiceul. Bogucicka 3b, 40287 Katowice, PolandEmail celina.olszakue.katowice.plAssessment of  Business Intelligence Maturity in the SelectedOrganizationsProceedings of the 2013 Federated Conference onComputer Science and Information Systems pp. 951958978146734471525.00 c 2013, IEEE 951mainframes. They were able to process the simple tasks foroperational and tactical management. They were characterized by production the simple reporting and represented simple,  static applications.  Individual  reports  were written byexpert programmers. BI 1.0 was focused on delivery to theconsumer and market leaders include SAS, IBM 9. The second age of BI 19902005  BI 2.0 is the type ofenterprise  scale  BI we see  today.  It  means a  concept andmethodologies for improvement of business decisions usingfacts and information from supporting systems 33. It  ischaracterized by enduser friendlier clientbased BI tools andcentralized. Data warehouse configured to deliver preformatted information to specialists analysts and users within management. So, the role of BI 2.0 and its impact on organizations compared to BI 1.0 has been changed. From simple,static analytical applications, BI 2.0 has  evolved into solutions that can be used in strategic planning, predictive modeling, forecasting, monitoring  operations, and  studying theprofitability of products 1,10.  BI 2.0 is focused on creation  and  delivery for  consumers  and  market  leaders  include Business Objects, Cognos, Hyperion, Microsoft, Teradata, Oracle. BI 3.0. presents a new era in the evolution of BI. Thanksto web and mobile technologies it appears intelligent business network for every one. There is a growing acceptanceof the idea that analysis is a collaborative not only singularand social effort. It  focuses on a collaborative workgroupswhich  are  selfregulated  and  on  information  outcomeswithin the confines  of  core business  interaction with customers, employees,  regulators etc. There is common sensethat  BI  3.0  should  go  beyond  reliance  on  structured  dataavailable in  internal  sources  but  should use also external,mostly unstructured data in  various formats  social  mediaposts, free form web content, images, and video files 11.BI 3.0 is concentrated on creation, delivery and management for consumers 9. According to Scott 12  there are5 core attributes that support BI 3.0 philosophy proactive,realtime,  integrated  with  business  processes,  operationalavailable to line workers, and extended to reach beyond theboundaries of the organizations to improve information delivery and decision support functionality for all.  It  is indicated also that there is no reason to depreciate in BI 3.0 thefunctions known from BI 2.0 like reporting, OLAP, datamining. They have still their strong position. BI 3.0 philosophy is to raise the added value of BI tools architecture byanchoring collaborative style of information search and analysis with intuitive and selfservice user interface that delivers  timely  and  highly  relevant  insights  to  anyone  who isproperly authorized and needs them 11. According  to  Chatter  13  there  are  3  prerequisites  forsoftware tools to be recognized as a BI 3.0 tools be social,relevant automatically delivers relevant insights that usersreally need according to their situation and user profile, andfully selfservice intuitiveness.The analysis of different articles, papers and reports showthat BI is mainly identified with tools, technologies, and software products. BI is usedto collect,  integrate,  analyze and make data available14.  It  includes  data  warehouse,  data  mining  andOLAP  Online  Analytical  Processing.  Data  warehouse is a key technology, integrating heterogenic datafrom different information sources for analytical purposes 7. Hence, it is assumed that the main tasks to befaced by BI include intelligent exploration, integration,aggregation  and  a  multidimensional  analysis  of  dataoriginating from various information resources 15 knowledge management. BI is the capability of the organization to explain, plan, predict, solve problems andlearn  in  order  to  increase  organizational  knowledge16. BI is assumed to be solution that is responsiblefor  transcription of  data into information and knowledge 10  decision support  systems.  BI is  considered  as  a  newgeneration  of  decision  supports  systems.  They differfrom  previous  management  information  systems  in,first  of  all,  their  wider  thematic  range,  multivariateanalysis,  semistructured data originating from different  sources  and  multidimensional  data  presentation17, 16, 6, 18 dashboards. Dashboards are the becoming the preferredmethod for delivering and displaying BI to users. Theyare  more  visual  and  intuitive,  and  typically  providelinkages that enable immediate action to be taken 5 new working culture with information  BI constitutesan important upturn in techniques of working with information  4.  It  means  specific  philosophy  andmethodology that would refer to working with information and knowledge, open communication and knowledge sharing 10. The BI users must know more thanjust  technology   business  and soft  skills  are neededtoo process. The process constitutes of activities to gather,select,  aggregate,  analyze,  and  distribute  information19. Some of these activities are the responsibility ofthe BI staff, while others are the joint responsibility ofthe BI staff and the business units 8 analytics and advanced analyses. The term analytics,introduced by Davenport and Harris 20, means theextensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models, factbased management to drive decisions and actions.  Analytics are asubset of what has come to be called BI a set of technologies and processes that use data to understand andanalyze business performance Competitive Business Intelligence CI. Another subsetof BI is CI. Its goal is to provide a balanced picture ofthe environment to the decision makers 15. CI is theanalytical process that transforms scattered informationabout competitors and customers into relevant, accurate952 PROCEEDINGS OF THE FEDCSIS. KRAKOW, 2013and usable  strategic  knowledge on market  evolution,business opportunities and threats.B. Business Intelligence in organizationsAccording to Goodhue, Wixom and Watson 8 there arethree  targets  that  organizations  can  aim  for   whenimplementing BI  single or a few applications. They are used in selecteddepartments marketing, sale, controlling etc. to support  effective  marketing  campaigns,  to  analyze  profitability different products and to monitor the behaviorsof customers BI infrastructure.  The organizations create  an  infrastructure for BI by clearing up and defining their data,establishing efficient process to move data from sourcesystems to a highly extensible data warehouse, implementing a variety of BI tools and applications, and investing in BI user training organizational transformation. BI systems are used inorder  to  introduce  new  business  model  oriented  onchange management, knowledge management and customer relationship management.  BI aims to run company differently. In this case, some investments in hugecorporate data warehouse are needed. Many case studies confirm that BI may be utilized in anorganization for 11, 21, 22 increasing  the  effectiveness  of  strategic,  tactic  andoperational  planning  including  first  of  all  amodelling different variants in the development of anorganization  b  informing  about  the  realization  ofenterprises  strategy,  mission,  goals  and  tasks  cproviding information on trends, results of introducedchanges  and  realization  of  plans  d  identifyingproblems and bottlenecks to be tackled e providinganalyses  of  the  best  and  the  worst  products,employees,  regions  f  providing  analyses  ofdeviations from the realization of plans for particularorganizational  units or  individuals  g  and providinginformation on the enterprises environment  creating or improving relations with customers, mainlya  providing  sales  representatives  with  adequateknowledge  about  customers  so  that  they  couldpromptly meet their customers needs b following thelevel of customers satisfaction together with efficiencyof business practices c and identifying market trends analysing  and  improving  business  processes  andoperational  efficiency  of  an  organization  particularlyby means of a providing knowledge and experienceemerged while developing and launching new productsonto the market b providing knowledge on particularbusiness  processes  c  exchanging  of  knowledgeamong research teams and corporate departments.The most spectacular results,  from using BI,  have beenobserved while running promotional campaigns, anticipatingsales and customer behaviors, creating loyalty policies andinvestigating anomalies and frauds 23.  The studies showthat BI may also generates a wide variety of organizationalbenefits 8. Some BI benefits are tangible and easy to measure e.g., the reduction of software and hardware licensesand fees. Other benefits, such as improved quality and timeliness  of  information  or  improvement  of  business  processand the enabling of new ways of doing business, are muchmore difficult to quantify, but they may generate a competitive advantage or open up new markets for the company. According to Howson 24, who examined 513 organizations,to the most significant measures of success of BI projectsbelong  improved  business  performance,  better  access  todata, support of key stakeholders, user perception that it ismission critical, return on investment, percentage of activeusers, costs savings, defined users.C. Business Intelligence maturity modelsThe  effective  development  of  BI  in  the  organizationshould be based on scientific theories. It seems that theory ofmaturity models gives the good foundation 25.  The termof maturity describes a state of being complete, perfect orready. To reach this a desired state of maturity, an evolutionary transformation path from an initial to a target stage needsto be progressed 26. Maturity models are used to guidethis transformation process. They help define and categorizethe state of an organizational capability 27. Maturity modelfor  BI  helps  organization  to  answer  for  these  questionswhere in the organization is most of the reporting and business  analysis  done today,  who is  using business  reports,analysis and success indicators, what drives BI in the organization, which strategies for developing BI are in use today, and what business value does BI bring 28.A high number of maturity models for BI has been proposed 26, 29, 27, 30.One of the most popular is Gartners Maturity Model forBusiness Intelligence and Performance Management. It describes a roadmap for organizations to find out where theyare in their usage of BI. It provides a path for progress bywhich they can benefit from BI initiatives. The model recognizes  five  levels  of  maturity  unaware,  tactical,  focused,strategic, and pervasive. The assessment includes three keyareas people, processes, metrics and technology 28, 29,30. The first level is often described as information anarchy. It means that data are incomplete, incorrect, inconsistent  and  organization  does  not  have defined  metrics.  Theuses of reporting tools are limited. The second level of BImaturity means that the organization starts to invest into BI.Metrics are usually used on the department level only. Mostof the data, tools, and applications are in silos. Users areoften not skilled enough in order to take advantage of the BIsystem.  At  the  third  BI  maturity  level  the  organizationachieves its first success and obtains some business benefitsfrom BI, but it still applies to a limited part of the organization.  Management  dashboards  are  often  requested  at  thislevel. At the strategic level, organizations have a clear business strategy for BI development. The application of BI isCELINA OLSZAK ASSESSMENT OF BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MATURITY 953often extended to customers and suppliers.  It  supports thetactical and strategic decision making. Sponsors come fromthe highest  management.  At the last  BI maturity level,  BIpays pervasive role for all areas of the business and corporate culture. BI provides flexibility for adapting to the fastbusiness changes and information demand. The users haveaccess  to  information  and  analysis  needed  for  creating  abusiness value and influence business performance. The usage of BI is available to customers, suppliers, and other business partners.Moving  from  one  maturity  level  to  another  requireschanges in all of the characteristics that make up these stagese.g.,  changes in management vision, founding,  data management 8.III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGYThe aim of the survey was to assess the BI using in 20purposefully  selected  organizations,  and  to  determine  thefactors that allow the firms to achieve high competences inBI, and consequently various business benefits 2.

KRAKOW, 2013nique  of  an  indepth  interview.  Types  of  core  interviewsquestions relevant to this paper are reflected in table 1. The survey was conducted in 2012 among purposefullyselected firms in Poland that are considered to be advancedin BI.  They represented the service sector telecommunications T4, consulting C4, banking B4, insurance I4,marketing agencies MA4. Interviews were held with executives, senior members of staff and ICT specialists. Interviewees were selected on their involvement in BI or on theirability to offer an insight based on experience in BI and related  decision  support  systems.  Gartners  Maturity  Modelfor Business Intelligence and Performance Management described in the previous section,  for the assessment of theBImaturity level in selected organizations, was used. IV. FINDINGSMy research confirmed that BI identified in the literaturewas  also  experienced  in  selected  organizations.  Table  2presents the answers for asked questions. The BI maturity insurveyed  organizations  mapping  onto  Gartners  MaturityModel for Business Intelligence and Performance Management  and  factors  that  allow them to  achieve  the  variousbusiness benefits with BI, are indicated in table 3. V. DISCUSSIONThe collected and processed data were mapped onto Gartners Maturity Model for Business Intelligence and Performance Management. The obtained results allow to state thatamong 20 surveyed organizations two organizations fall intothe category of pervasive level. These were telecommunication company and marketing agency. Their analytical andBI competences are aimed at business benefits, like acquiring new customers, launching new products and new channels of sale. BI competences are treated by these organizations as theircore competences that help them to compete on the market.Organizations achieve significant economic benefits and useBI for marketing analyses sales profitability, profit margins,meeting  sales  targets,  time  of  orders,  customer  analysestime  of  maintaining  contacts  with  customers,  customerTABLE II.TYPES OF ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERSNo Asked questions during interviews Answers  number of organizations1 How do you define BI Tools  to  manage  information  9,  data  warehouse  5,  analyticalapplications 4, new way of doing business 22 What do you use BI for reporting, adhoc reporting, analyzing, alerting, predictive modeling, operationalizing, optimization, activating, etc. Reporting 15, adhoc reporting 9, analyzing 12, alerting 2, predictivemodeling 2, optimization 3, activating 23 Does your organization have a defined BI strategy Comprehensive BI strategy 5, partly defined BI strategy 12, none 34 Does your organization have defined business processesDefined basic processes 9, defined core business processes 6, not defined 5 5 Does your organizationdepartment have defined metricsMetrics for selected departments 13, metrics for the whole organization4, none metrics 36 Assess the quality of data used in your organization complete, correct, consistent highmediumpoor quality data, etc.High quality data 6, medium quality data 11, rather poor quality data 37 Are you skilled enough in order to take advantage of BI systems Skilled enough 7, not skilled enough 8, poor skilled 58 Do you use management dashboards Used management dashboards in limited scope 14, used management dashboards in whole organization 4, not used 29 Is your BI unlimited to the partdepartment of organizationBI limited to the part of organization 15, unlimited 510 Are you motivated to use BI how Users motivated by training 8, motivated by bonuses 6, not motivated 611 Do you use BI for analyzing customers, suppliers, competitors and other business partnersBI for analyzing customers 17, suppliers 14, competitors 5, other stakeholders 412 Who is the sponsorship of BI in your organization CIO 3, senior management 6, business analyst 4, ICT specialists 7 13 What kind of BI software do you use Regional data warehouse 9, centralized data warehouse 5, operational data bases 614 Describe some successesfailures from using BI Success acquiring new customers 14, acquiring new suppliers 11, increase of sale 8, fraud detection 6, launching new channels of sale 3, launching new products 3.

The common analytical approach is used by the whole organization where broadly supported factbased and learning culture is cultivated. The interviewees confirmed that the factors that help those organizations  to  stay  at  that  high  maturity  level  in  BI,  includestrong support of CEO and all users trust in BI.An interesting group was made up of organizations classified  at  the  fourth  BI  maturity  level.  Four  organizations1MA, 1T, 2B in my study fit into the strategic level. Theydo not compete through BI, but they have high competences in  using  different  BI  analyses,  like  financial  analysesreviewing  of  costs  and  revenues,  calculation  andcomparative  analyses  of  corporate  income  statements,analyses  of  corporate  balance  sheet  and  profitability,customer  profitability,  customer  segmentation,  improvingmarketing effectiveness. It seems that there is a very little tobe done in order to use BI for making significant changes inrunning a business.  Therefore,  shifting these organizationsfrom strategic to pervasive level requires more supportfrom  CEO  and  hisher  real  passion.  The  intervieweesindicated  the  greater  need  for  motivation  of  users  forcollecting, analyzing and using information.The  survey  has  shown  that  up  to  9  organizations  2T,1MA, 2C, 2I, 2B use BI on the department level. Althoughthey would be much more common in a random sample, andperhaps the largest group. BI in these organizations has notbeen playing a strategic role and benefits from it are limited.BI is used to perform ad hoc reporting and to answer questions related to departments ongoing operations, uptodatefinancial standing, sales and cooperation with suppliers andcustomers.  BI and management are often not aligned. Theobservation and interviews with senior executives allow tostate that the lack of appropriate knowledge about possibilities of BI among staff results in a relatively low use of it.Therefore, the main tasks for organizations include first ofall developing corporate culture based on facts and learning,TABLE III.OVERVIEW OF BI MATURITY LEVELS IN SURVEYED ORGANIZATIONSLevel People Process Metrics and technology Scope of benefitsUnaware Users do not know their own data requirements orhow to use themUsers do not know business processes data are poor qualityLack of appropriate hardware andsoftware the metrics are not defined the use of reporting is limited Almost noneTactical2I,2C,1MAThe users take the first BI initiativeslow support from senior executivesIdentification of basic business processesRegional data warehouses are built analyzing trends and past data first interactive reporting tools metrics are usually used on the department level onlyLow benefits limited to small group of users better access to data and static reportingSuccess factors support from senior management, appropriate BI tools, quality of data, defined business processes and metricsFocused2T, 1MA, 2C, 2I, 2BUsers try to optimize the efficiency of individual departments by BIStandardization of business processes and building best practices in BI Management dashboards are used a centralized data warehouse is built adhoc reporting, query drilldownBenefits limited to departments and business units improvement of internal business processesand decision making on operational levelSuccess factors developing corporate culture based on facts, stating clearly BI strategy, implementing training system on BIStrategic1MA, 1T,2B Users have high BI capabilities, but often notaligned with right roleBusiness process management based on facts Highquality data have BI strategy using more complex prediction and modeling tools data miningBenefits for the whole organization integrated analysis for finance, logistics, production improvement of decision making on all levels of managementSuccess factors support from CEO, motivation of users for collecting, analyzing and using informationPervasive1T, 1MAUsers have capabilities and time to use BI skill training in BI users are encouraged to collect, process analyze and share information CEO passion and broadbased management commitmentBroadly supported, processoriented culture based on facts, learning and sharing of knowledge Enterprisewide BI architecture largely implemented customized reports business and BI are aligned and cooperativeBenefits for the whole environment competing inBI new ways of doing business Success factors strong support of CEO, effective HRM and all users trust in BI956 PROCEEDINGS OF THE FEDCSIS. KRAKOW, 2013stating clearly BI strategy and implementing training systemon BI. I found in my study that 5 organizations 2I, 2C, 1MAare at the position of tactical maturity level. They use atraditional  approach  to  management,  focused  more on theperforming the basic tasks of departments than on businessprocesses. The knowledge about BI in these organizations israther  low and identified mainly with regional  data warehouses or databases. Only basic business processes are recognized and basic metrics are used. The interviewees indicated that many users have some problems with recognizingtheir own data after processing. The users  have rather lowexperience with other types of management information systems. Their intellectual resources are not adequate in orderto develop complex BI infrastructure and to use it for improvement of business processes and decisionmaking. To conclude the discussion on the use of BI in surveyedorganizations, I wonder why organizations in a similar segment, with similar financial resources and comparable BI infrastructure, derive from BI such diverse benefits e.g. in thestudied case, telecommunications companies and advertisingagencies. Seeking the answer to this question it should benoted that the organizations, that have been classified intothe  category of   BI pervasive  level,  were  highly determined to collect,  process,  analyze,  and share  information.Corporate culture based on facts and learning helped them touse chances offered by BI. The most important factors thatdecided on the success of BI  initiatives refer not to the technology, but  to the strong believe of all users in BI. VI. CONCLUSIONSThe main conclusion of this study is that BI systems maybe a trigger for making more effective decisions, improvingbusiness processes and business performance, as well as doing  new business.  Observation  and  conducted  discussionswith interviews let to state, that the factors that allow organizations to achieve business benefits with BI, include first ofall management leadership and support, corporate culture,expressed by effective information resources  management,clearly stated strategy and objectives, and  use of appropriateBI technologies.  Additionally,  the  important  factors  wereclearly  defined  business  processes,  business  performancemeasurement, incentive system to encourage collecting, analyzing information and knowledge sharing, appropriate resources financial, intellectual, training and education on BIand knowledge management. The research has made a theoretical contribution to ourunderstanding of BI issue. The outcomes extend current theory on BI and provide useful information, which hopefullywill help the organizations to understand the consequencesof the different ways of BI using, as well as, to determine thefactors on which they should give particular attention whilebuilding different BI applications.REFERENCES1 T.
