IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING, VOL. 55, NO. 2, JUNE 2009 315An Overview of IPTV Standards DevelopmentJulien Maisonneuve, Muriel Deschanel, Juergen Heiles, Wei Li, Hong Liu, Randy Sharpe, and Yiyan WuAbstractIn the last few years, IPTV has emerged as oneof the major distribution and access techniques for broadbandmultimedia services. It is one of the primary growth areas for thetelecommunications industry. However, existing IPTV systemsare generally based on proprietary implementations that do notprovide interoperability. Recently, many international standardbodies have published, or are developing, a series of IPTV relatedstandards.. This paper is an overview of the most significant recentand upcoming IPTV standards.Index TermsBroadcast, IPTV, multicast, networks.I. INTRODUCTIONTELEVISION distribution is one of the largest technologyinfrastructures deployed after telephone and electricpower networks. Digital technologies have completely transformed the telephone system creating a much more versatileand dynamic telecommunications infrastructure and services.The television distribution is now undergoing a similar digitalrevolution. Internet Protocol Television, or IPTV, is one of thepromising techniques which takes a step further by mergingtelecommunications and digital television delivery services,unleashing new, more personal options to consumers, andfulfilling the promises of a real home broadband multimediaexperience.By early 2009, there should be more than 25 million IPTVusers in the world. Now it is a good time to take a step back andlook at what has been achieved, what is missing and what thefuture might be holding.The motivation for this IPTV special edition also resides inthe completion of a number of standardization activities thathave taken several years to achieve. It is interesting to take alook at what standards have to offer, and how they might changethe landscape of IPTV in the years to come.Manuscript received January 28, 2009 revised February 17, 2009.

An Opening MarketIPTV has been a significant driver for telecom investments forthe last few years. The bandwidth requirements of video transmission make it one of, if not the most, demanding massmarkettelecommunication applications to date. Transmission of a Standard Definition SD video stream takes several Mbits, whileHigh Definition HD reaches into the tens Mbits. This is farmore than what is required for voice transmission typically 32to 64 Kbits, or even to browse the internet.As a result, IPTV has been the best motivation for operatorsto deploy higherspeed DSL no longer 256784 Kbits but up to28 Mbits, and to consider deploying optical fiber beyond central offices to curb cabinets FTTC, buildings or even homesFTTH. These capacity upgrades also bring much higher Internet communication speed and enable new services such asvideo telephony or file sharing, but it is not certain that in isolation they would have been a sufficient motivation for operatorsto invest in massive new infrastructures, or indeed for customersto pay premium subscriptions. IPTV has been the catalyst for atechnology leap.Because the basic technologyIPis the same for the Internet connection and IPTV, it enables a more fluid mix of services that can share the available bandwidth more consistently.B. Differences Between TV, IPTV and WebTVThe advantages and challenges of IPTV reside in the differences between existing terrestrial broadcasting TV, cable TVand satellite TV 25. IPTV differentiates from traditional terrestrial broadcasting TV in many ways. Table I lists some majordifferences between these two services.Comparing with existing cable TV and satellite TV, IPTVdistinguishes itself with full interactivity, high personalizationand flexibility as shown in Table II.IPTV is not TV that is broadcasted over the Internet. Thereare actually wide spread confusions between Internet TV andIPTV. Table III illustrates a comparison between the two.0018931625.00  2009 IEEEAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London. Downloaded on June 07,2010 at 193859 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

IPTV and StandardsInterestingly, because IPTV is deployed within private IPnetworks and it does not consume rare and shared resourcessuch as radio spectrum, there has been no immediate need tostandardize systems and architectures. Indeed, one operator canchoose to deploy several IPTV systems on the same networkwithout major ill effects if you exclude overall cost, the needfor a dedicated set top box and distribution network bandwidthoccupied by several systems operating in parallel.This low level of constraint and the lack of a readily availableand comprehensive IPTV standard lead to a flurry of proprietaryimplementations that now constitute the base of all IPTV systems in operation over the world. However, those systems arestill based on a number of key standards that had already reachedprevalence at design time.Digital Video is not a new standardization subject, it has beenseen as a key development sector for more than 20 years. Inthat space, some groups and organizations have gained almostuniversal recognition. The first one is probably MPEG MotionPicture Expert Group for its video coding MPEG2, MPEG4and transmission protocols MPEG TS.Because of the unavoidable role of IP, the second one wouldcertainly be IETF Internet Engineering Task Force for its delivery and control protocols RTPRTCP, RTSP, SDP, SIP, etc..Fig. 1. Structure of IPTV systems.Many other organizations have worked on IPTV specifications, but none has yet gained the industrywide recognition andthere are no deployed systems based on those standards at thistime. Before we start standards review, it is important to obtaina generic picture that will help to outline the differences andcommon points between the proposed standard architectures.D. Structure of IPTV SystemsBy definition, IPTV is about sending video streams froma source a streaming device where the content is distributedfrom to a terminal. Video traffic can be divided in two categories broadcast and video on demand. The former generallyrequires the use of IP multicast to reduce the network bandwidth required to carry the video streams by sharing it betweenusers. The latter generally uses plain Unicast point to pointdelivery, but may be accelerated by interposing Content Delivery Networks.To get access to video content either content on demand orbroadcast, a terminal needs to be aware of its existence and howto access it this is the role of the service guide.The following diagram Fig. 1 gives a very high level architecture of an IPTV system.While the interface to the access network is generallycommon, there are significant variations on how the othercomponents e.g. control subsystem, Service Guide, etc. arestructured and behave. In a setting where even subtle variationson protocols or data formats can be a barrier to interoperability,these differences created several families of systems, andcorresponding standards have been developed.II. IPTV STANDARDIZATION ACTIVITIESA. IPTV Standard Development at DVB ProjectTraditionally, Digital Video Broadcasting DVB services aredelivered over broadcasting networks, i.e. a onetomany unidirectional architecture. The advent of highspeed bidirectionalconsumer broadband networks means that there is an increasingdemand to offer DVB services over IP Internet Protocol networks. The delivery of TV services using bidirectional IP overa broadband network presents a particular set of challenges, especially when integrated with a range of other IP services.DVB projects task, in response to calls from the industry, isto help define and develop appropriate standards for the deliveryof DVB services over such networks, and to provide a means ofAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London.

AN OVERVIEW OF IPTV STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT 317integrating them with other broadband services, whilst maintaining maximum interoperability with existing DVB broadcaststandards.DVB was one of the pioneer organizations to start standardization work on the delivery of TV services over IP networks.The DVB TMIPI Technical ModuleInternet Protocol Infrastructure working group was set up back in 2000. Eight yearslater, DVB released the fourth revision of the Transport ofMPEG 2 TS Based DVB Services over IP Based Networksspecification, also referred to as the DVBIPTV 1.4 handbook,and soon to be published by ETSI as TS102 034 v1.4.1 1.DVB is led by commercial requirements which have evolvedover time as services have been introduced and deployed. Thishas led to continuing updates of DVBIPTV specifications.The goal of the DVBIPTV handbook is to specify technologies on the interface between an IP network and a Home Network End Device HNED, for example a SetTop Box, enabling deployment of TV services over IPbased networks andmass production of IPTV receivers by Consumer Electronicsmanufacturers. The technologies specified, implemented in aDVBIPTV HNED, should allow a consumer to buy such a receiver in offtheshelf, connect it to a broadband network, andbe able to choose and consume DVB services available over theIP network. The specification covers several types of IPTV services, such as Live Media Broadcast i.e. TV or radio services,Content on Demand, and content download services.The following key functionalities are specified by the DVBIPTV handbook The delivery of DVB MPEG2 TS based services overbidirectional IP networks for Live Media Broadcast services i.e. TV or radio services and Content on DemandCoD services. The transport part of the specificationcovers the encapsulation of MPEG2 TS services forstreaming delivery over IP and the protocols to be used toaccess such services. Quality of Service is covered, basedon Differentiated Services DiffServ. The delivery of Content Download Services CDSs.CDSs provide the download of content items to a localstorage of the HNED via a broadband IP connection.CDSs can be used to provide IPTV services in areas wherea broadband connection suitable for streaming services isnot available or prone to errors, for simultaneous deliveryof multiple content items to HNEDs or for reduced costoffers as the bandwidth consumption may be limitedcompared to streaming services. Two types of services aresupported push download services where the distributiondecision is taken by the service provider without explicitrequest from the user and pull download services wherethe download is requested by the user. The Service Discovery and Selection SDS mechanismfor DVB based AV services over bidirectional IP networks. The service discovery information, its data formatand the protocols to use for carriage of this informationare defined. Both push and pull models of delivery aresupported. Binarization encoding of SDS information isspecified and can optionally be used if required. Supportfor advanced codecs, logical channel numbering and signaling regional DVBIPTV services is provided. The use of command and control applicationlevel protocolRTSP to control CoD services and optionally to join multicast services. The assignment of an IP Address to a Home Network EndDevice HNED to get onto the network. The specificationis based on DHCP and is restricted to the scenarios wherean HNED has a single interface onto the home networkand there is a single Delivery Network Gateway DNGper home network segment. The File Upload System Stub FUSS which is mandatoryand allows the system software of an HNED to be updatedon a powercycle or reboot. The sending of the system software will be handled by the mechanisms in the optionalRemote Management and Firmware Update System forDVBIPTV Services RMSFUS specification, ETSI TS102 824 2. Discovery of Broadband Content Guides including thirdparty. The Broadband Content Guide is a content guidethat is delivered over an alwayson bidirectional IP network and is provided as a separate specification, ETSI TS102 539 3. An optional protocol for Application Layer FECALFEC protection of streaming media for DVBIPTVservices carried over RTP transport. This ALFEC protocol is a layered protocol with a base layer and zero ormore optional enhancement layers. The base layer is asimple packetbased interleaved parity code based on asubset of SMPTE 202214. The base layer shall be usedwherever ALFEC is used. The enhancement layer is aRaptor code, as defined in ETSI TS 126 346 5 and ETSITS 102 472 6 and may optionally be used to providefurther packet loss protection. An optional retransmission mechanism RET to providefor protection against packet loss of DVBIPTV servicescarried over RTP transport. It specifies the mechanism toprovide immediate feedback FB towards the networkusing RTCP and how to retransmit the missing packets.Packet loss repair can be achieved using the optional ALFECsolution, the optional retransmission solution or a combinationof both solutions.The DVBIPTV handbook specifies technologies on the interface to the HNED and only the minimum necessary for interoperability. The implementation of the HNED is left to theCE Consumer Electronic manufacturers. The same applies forthe implementation of networking and service provider systems,as long as their implementations meet the requirements on thestandardized HNED interface.Fig. 2 defines a reference model of the home network andsome key interfaces. The key interface for standardization in theDVBIPTV handbook is the IP Infrastructure1 IPI1 interface. The advanced home network functionality is not coveredin the current DVBIPTV handbook and will be defined in a separate specification.Fig. 3 is a logical diagram of the highlevel protocols on theIPI1 interface, specified in the DVBIPTV 1.4 handbook for enabling DVB services over IPbased networks and the associateddelivery and network support services. The organization of thisprotocol stack is based on the hierarchical structure frequentlyAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London.

Home network reference model.Fig. 3. Diagram of the protocol stack for DVBIPTV services.applied in equipment design, i.e. service offering and applications, middleware and functions, IP protocols and transport, andPHYMAClink layers. This follows the ISOOSI layering convention in general terms.The top layer of this stack signifies the service offering intended by the Service Provider. This consists of programs, information about programs, multicast andor unicast IP addressesi.e. the essential items needed to enable a DVB service over anIP network.The IP protocol and transport layer attempts to identify whichprotocols and transports are required and map the usage of thoseprotocols and transports to the functions of the layers above.Operators require the flexibility to deploy IPTV servicesaccording to their market requirements and business models,taking into account the access network capabilities such aslimited bit rate. As an example, they may initially deploy onlyone type of IPTV service e.g. only live TV or only ContentDownload, or they may want to mix a DVBIPTV compliantIPTV service with a proprietary IPTV service e.g. a DVBcompliant live TV service, and a proprietary Video on Demandportal. The DVBIPTV handbook does not define subsets andit became evident that a small set of service oriented profileswere required to facilitate and maximize the stepwise deployment of IPTV services. This is essential for lowercost anddifferentiated services that do not require full implementationof the DVBIPTV handbook.ETSI TS102 826 7 defines four service oriented profiles A basic profile to accommodate existing IPTV deployments of live TV services. This is the first step to achievea basic degree of DVBIPTV compliance. Live Media Broadcast profile to build live IPTV servicescarried over multicast transport and using SDS for discovery with legacy SIPSI metadata support. Content on Demand profile to build OnDemand IPTV services carried over unicast transport, RTSP connection, andrequiring BCG Broadcast Content Guide discovery withTVAnytime metadata support. Content Download profile to build services of contentavailable for download either in push or pull modes.The structure used to define a profile is presented in moredetails in Fig. 4.DVB has also defined IPTV profiles for its interactive middleware specifications, DVBMHP and GEM.IPTV continues to be a very active and evolving activity inDVB with many stakeholders involved both in the technical andcommercial groups. Future releases of the specification will seemany new and exciting features including a solution for fastchannel change which gives great improvement on zapping timebetween TV services. Many research works have been done inthis area 3235.However, the distribution of audiovisual content is evolvingquickly and DVB needs to prepare the next steps. Work has nowbeen organized around two tracks. Track 1 covers delivery ofAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London. Downloaded on June 07,2010 at 193859 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

Relationship between profile, module, option and extension.DVB services over managed IP networks and Track 2 coversdelivery over the Open Internet.The technical work on DVBIPTV so far has been part ofTrack 1 which will continue to evolve and will include in thefuture more flexible stream composition to enhance IPTV services, more straightforward interfaces to nPlay solutions e.g.telecommunication, mobile, etc., and also support for hybridDVB broadcast and DVBIPTV services. The recently startedTrack 2 will cover the distribution of commercial content overthe Open Internet. DVB will endeavor to continue collaborationwith other standards development organizations through formalliaisons as it is recognized that cooperation is essential to thesuccess of DVB solutions for IPTV in particular in the area ofnPlay.B. ETSI TISPANETSI TISPAN European Telecommunications StandardsInstitute Telecommunications and Internet converged Servicesand Protocols for Advanced Networking was chartered in2004 to standardize Fixed NGN, working alongside 3GPPwhich concentrated on mobile NGN. TISPAN NGN R1 wascompleted in 2005 and focused on networking and VOIPaspects. After more than two years of hard work, TISPAN haspublished NGN R2 in June 2008. There are two variants ofIPTV in TISPAN R2 and also in R3, differing in how they usethe IMS IP Multimedia Subsystem, originated in the mobileworld of 3GPP components.TISPAN is open to all ETSI members and associate members. Members usually are European companies, while associatemembers can come from other countries typically from Asia orAmerica. A number of nonEuropean companies participate asfull members through European subsidiaries. TISPAN membership is mainly composed of telecom vendors and operators.TISPAN and IPTV In TISPAN, IPTV is not the primary focusof activities. To some extent IPTV can be seen as an application a Service, among others such as voice services that is provided over a network and benefits from an existing ecosystem.IPTV is thus reusing the properties of TISPAN NGN, such asQoS, user and service profiles, authentication with variants,charging, etc.NGN R1 did not address IPTV, but it was quickly recognizedthat IPTV became a key application for NGN networks. IPTVhad higher bandwidth requirements than most existing applications such as voice and potential for rapid massmarket deployment more than videoconferencing. As a result, a numberof participants started to develop requirements for IPTV in late2005 8. Two philosophies were developed on how those requirements should be fulfilled one was to adapt existing IETFprotocols to an NGN environment, the other to reuse the IMSmachinery for providing IPTV services. Because of the waythose two specifications were developed, they do not share manycomponents and can be described separately.Dedicated IPTV This IPTV variant 9 was designed as anadaptation for NGN of the principles used in many existingIPTV systems and mainly DVBIP as shown in Fig. 5. It isbased on proven IETF protocols HTTP, RTSP, IGMP used ina straightforward way. Authentication needs to be supportedwithin the dedicated IPTV subsystem, but it otherwise makesuse of the NGN elements used to store user profiles UPSF andcontrol network characteristics and QoS NASS and RACS. Inaddition, it can make use of NGN charging. It supports 3 types ofIPTV services with trick play pause, rewind, forward Broadcast, Content on demand, and NPVR network personal videorecorder.The interaction between the User Equipment and the networkconforms to the DVBIP 1.3 specification 1, as outlined in12 and uses HTTP and RTSP to control sessions. IGMP isused to access multicast channels from the terminal. Bandwidthreservation is performed on the RACS through the Gq interface,just as other TISPAN applications.IMSBased IPTV This IPTV variant 14 was designed totake advantage of the benefits of the 3GPP IMS, originally developed to support IP multimedia communications in mobilenetworks as shown in Fig. 6. It relies on the use of the core IMSand manages most interactions through the SIP session initiation protocol 13 protocol. As a result, it benefits from the popular IMS features implicit authentication, roaming across IMSAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London.

TISPAN dedicated IPTV architecture.Fig. 6. TISPAN IMSbased IPTV architecture.networks, and natural interfacing to NGN components UPSF,NASS, RACS, charging. It supports 3 types of IPTV serviceswith trick play pause, rewind, forward Broadcast, Content ondemand, and NPVR network personal video recorder.Handling of Content on Demand session is very close to thenatural IMS model where session establishment and media control are joined SIPSDP interaction yields a bandwidthallocated session to the Media Delivery Function. Media controlpause, rewind, forward, etc. is then performed using a directRTSP connection to the Media Server.Broadcast sessions are treated differently since they requireseparation in two conceptual steps, one to reserve bandwidthand another to gain access to multicast channels. To improveperformance, channel switching does not go through the IMScore unless session parameters bandwidth or charging change.As a result a third step is introduced to inform the IPTV application of which channel a user settles upon.The startup procedure begins with IMS registration of the userequipment, and is followed by a service discovery procedure.The latter can take two forms one is to use SIP to get the discovery data, and the other uses HTTP to get to the DVB ServiceDiscovery and selection mechanism. The User Equipment canalso get access to DVB BCG or OMA BCAST ESG.The specification makes ample use of SIP extensions such assubscribe and notify to provide additional services. The specification is following the same principles as the ones of the OpenIPTV Forum, but differs in a few aspects, making interoperability unlikely without some alignment work.Perspectives on TISPAN R3 In Release 3, the two families ofspecifications will support new features described in 9 IPTVpresence, access to third party content, P2P distribution, interface with a Content Distribution Network, Forward Error Correction, NPVR command from another terminal and more features that are added progressively. The R3 dedicated IPTV specification is 11 and the IMSbased IPTV specification is 15.Assessment After a few years of work, ETSI TISPANcomes up with two reasonably complete IPTV specificationsone based on IMS and the other based on DVBIP 1.3. Theyinnovate in their degree of integration in the telecom network,Authorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London. Downloaded on June 07,2010 at 193859 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

AN OVERVIEW OF IPTV STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT 321and borrow very significant elements from other existing specifications mainly DVBIP.There are only a limited number of common components between these two specifications, less than what was achievablewhen looking at the diagrams of ATIS IIF and ITUT FG IPTV.The specifications level of maturity has prompted otherorganizations such as MSF MultiService Forum to reusethe specifications for interoperability testing. There is a nearfeature parity between the two, and their success will thus betested in the market, according to their respective merits andperformances.C. ATIS IIFThe Alliance for Telecommunications Industry SolutionsATIS is a leading standards development and technicalplanning organization committed to rapidly developing andpromoting technical and operations standards for the communications and related information technologies industryworldwide using a pragmatic, flexible and open approach.Participants from more than 300 communications companiesare active in ATIS 22 industry committees, Incubator SolutionsPrograms, and other activities httpwww.atis.org.The ATIS Board of Directors approved the formation of theIPTV Interoperability Forum IIF in July 2005.

ITUT IPTV Focus Group and GSIThe International Telecommunications UnionTelecommunication Standardization Sector ITUT, formerly CCITT is aGenevabased United Nations UN organization responsiblefor fostering cooperative standards for telecommunicationsequipment and systems. The ITUT mission is to ensure theefficient and timely production of standards referred to asRecommendations covering all fields of telecommunicationson a worldwide basis, as well as defining tariff and accountingprinciples for international telecommunication services. Giventhat IPTV is becoming an increasingly important service in themarket, and that more and more manufacturers and operatorsare facing challenges from technical as well as regulatoryissues, ITUT has received proposals to strengthen its work onIPTV standardization. There is an urgent need to increase theinternational effort on various issues, in particular, interoperability and gap analysis of IPTV standards. Since late 2005,ITUT Study Group Chairmen have studied possible measuresto take care of the IPTV study within ITUT, including coordination with other Standardization Developing OrganizationsSDOs. During the TSB directors consultation meeting onIPTV standardization 22, the consensus had been reached tosupport the TSB Director to create, according to ITUT Recommendation A.7 23, a focus group, the IPTV Focus GroupFG IPTV. Focus Group is a more efficient way to allow ITUto take the lead in coordinating and developing global standardsto enable rapid progress and to avoid market fragmentation.The mission of FG IPTV was agreed on this TSB directorsmeeting 22 as The mission of IPTV FG is to coordinate andpromote the development of global IPTV standards taking intoaccount the existing work of the ITU study groups as well asStandards Developing Organizations, Fora and Consortia.Different from Study Groups SGs, the FG IPTV opens toITU member states, sector members and associates, and it alsoopens to any individual from a country which is a member ofITU who wishes to contribute to the work this includes individuals who are also members of international, regional andnational organizations. This provides ITUT the way of responding to market needs very quickly and of doing the job inthe most efficient, transparent and professional manner.As a start point, the following goals of FG IPTV weredeveloped Definition of IPTV Review and gap analysis of existing standards and ongoingworks Coordination of existing standardization activities Harmonization of the development of new standardsAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London.

FG IPTV and IPTV GSI compositions. Encourage interoperability with existing systems wherepossibleFrom July 2006 until December 2007, a total of seven meetings were held. As illustrated in Fig. 7, the FG IPTV separatedits tasks into six areas corresponding to six Working GroupsWGs. Significant progresses have been made in these sixareas. Each area has produced enriched documents coveringmost of the IPTV worldwide development efforts.The FG IPTV ended in December 2007 and its documentswere transferred to the appropriate study groups via StudyGroup 13. The ongoing work has been carried out under theumbrella of a Global Standards Initiative IPTVGSI viarelated study groups SGs. Fig. 7 shows the IPTVGSI relatedSGs. The IPTVGSI focuses on speedy preparation of ITUTRecommendations standards based on the output of the FocusGroup as well as the detailed protocols necessary.Some important achievements towards IPTV standardizationare listed belowDefinition of IPTV The consensus was reached during thefirst FG IPTV meeting on the IPTV definition 24 IPTV isdefined as multimedia services such as televisionvideo audiotextgraphicsdata delivered over IP based networks managed toprovide the required level of QoSQoE, security, interactivityand reliability.IPTV Domains Four IPTV domains are identified includingcontent provider, service provider, network provider and enduser.IPTV Architectural Approaches Three IPTV architectureapproaches are identified that enable service providers to deliver IPTV services. These include NonNGN IPTV functionalarchitecture NonNGN IPTV, NGNbased nonIMS IPTVfunctional architecture NGNNonIMS IPTV 26, 27, NGNIMSbased IPTV functional architecture NGNIMSIPTV28.IPTV Functional Architecture Fig. 8 provides an overviewof the IPTV functional architecture. Functions and functionalblocks described in this clause are common to all architecturalapproaches. Various IPTV architectural options and more detailed architectural descriptions can be found in 29.Quality of Experience QoE Dimensions QoE is defined in30 as the overall acceptability of an application or service, asperceived subjectively by the enduser. Quality of Service QoSis defined in 31 as the collective effect of performance whichdetermines the degree of satisfaction of a user of the service. Intelecommunications, QoS is usually a measure of performanceof the network itself.Fig. 9 shows factors contributing to QoE.In upcoming IPTVGSI events, regular ITUT workingmethods and procedures will apply by means of the workcarried out by the experts of the relevant Study Groups whereglobal standards will be developed.Up to now, a total of five IPTVGSI events have been held.For example, SG13 next generation networks further detailsthe IPTV architectural design issues including requirements,network control, service management, traffic classification, etc.SG16 multimedia terminals, systems and applications continuously completes the IPTV terminal device basic models, service discovery and consumption mechanisms, multicast function support, broadcastcentric IPTV terminal middleware, etc.SG12 is working towards the completion of new recommendations on IPTV QoE, performance monitoring, etc. The IPTVGSI events see many new draft recommendations on differentaspects Questions in various Study Groups.E. Open IPTV ForumThe Open IPTV Forum is a panindustry initiative with theobjective to specify a common and open endtoend solution forsupplying a variety of IPTV and internet multimedia servicesto retail based consumer equipment in the home. The Forum,which is open to participation from the communications,entertainment and other relevant industries, will focus on thedevelopment of open standards that will help streamline andaccelerate deployments of IPTV technologies, and maximizethe benefits of IPTV for consumers, network operators, contentproviders, service providers, consumer electronics manufacturers and home and network infrastructure providers.The Forum was founded in January 2007 by Ericsson, FranceTelecom, Nokia Siemens Networks, Panasonic, Philips, SamAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London.

IPTV architectural overview.Fig. 9. QoE dimensions.sung, Sony and Telecom Italia. While standardization for IPTVwas already going on at that time in several standardizationbodies, the founding members noted that a single specificationthat covers all aspects of endtoend solutions for IPTV and multimedia services delivered both via Managed Networks and theOpen Internet as shown in Fig. 10 was missing. Such a specification will ensure the interoperability between consumer equipment and the service offerings, which will make it possible forthe end users to easily access their choice of content and servicesoffered from multiple service providers. The Forums plan is toextend the specification work with a certification and logo program in order to foster interoperability. In the mean time theForum membership has increased to over 60 members coveringmost parts of the IPTV ecosystem.An important objective of the Forum is to base its specifications on existing technologies and open standards as much aspossible. The intention of the Forum is not to create yet anotherstandardization initiative, but to define a complete delivery solution by profiling existing standards and filling the gaps wherenecessary. The Forum will work closely with existing standardization efforts and address those areas which need enhancements by actively contributing the work of the Forum. Currentlythe Forum is in the process to setup liaison activities with relevant standardization organizations and fora.Fig. 10. Open IPTV forum scope.The Forums directions are set by the Steering Group, supported by four adhoc groups for working procedures, administration and budget, certification and logo program and standards coordination as shown in Fig. 11. Five working groupsare assigned to drive the Forums specification, interoperability,testing, and marketing activities. Requirements specified by theRequirements Working Group are the starting point of any specification work. These requirements are defined based on usercases contributed by the Forums members. Based on the requirements a functional architecture is defined by the Architecture Working Group in order to provide the directions for thetechnical specifications defined by the Solution Working Group.The Solution Working Group has several Task Forces to coverspecific areas of the overall solutions like protocols, codecs,metadata, content protection and application execution environments. Based on the technical specification, the Interoperability Test Working Group will define test specifications as inputfor the planned certification  logo program. The objective ofthe Marketing Working Group is to communicate and promotethe Forums activities and specifications in order to obtain widerrecognition and support in the industry and from endusers.Authorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London.

Open IPTV forum organization.The Forum has just published its technical specification workfor Release 1. Release 1 focuses on basic IPTV services likescheduled content service, content on demand and personalvideo recording. In addition the integration with communication services like chatting and messaging and interactiveapplications are in the focus. For a detailed description ofthe Release 1 services and functions see 16. The Release 1Requirements 17 and Architecture 18 are already finalizedand publicly available. The technical specifications are expected to be finalized in mid of 2008. In parallel the work onrequirements for Release 2 has already started. It will extendthe Open IPTV Forum specifications with enhanced interactivefunctions, tighter integration with communication services,new advertising features and the support of converged services,which can be accessed on various end devices connected viafixed and mobile access networks. This will allow the end userto consume and control IPTV services not only on the TV, butalso on the PC, mobile phone and PDA at home or on the move.As an unique approach, the Forum covers IPTV and multimedia services available both via a Managed Network and theOpen Internet. A common UserNetwork Interface UNI willensure that the end user has access to a variety of services offered by multiple service providers both over Managed Networks and the Open Internet. This will make the overall service offering more attractive and result in a wider availability ofend devices as they will not be dedicated to a specific serviceoffering. It is expected that Open IPTV Forum compliant enddevices will become available for the retail market, giving theend user a choice between different devices and different serviceofferings and as such stimulating the overall IPTV market. Inorder to achieve the goal of a common UNI, but still be open fordifferent business models, the Forum has defined several functional entities within the consumer domain as shown in Fig. 12.The Open IPTV Forum Terminal Function OITF providesthe basic functionality to access IPTV services via the Open Internet. This includes services discovery, user profile management, metadata processing, content streaming, content and service protection, audio and video decoding, service monitoringand a declarative application environment for server based applications and access to web based services. Service discovery,Fig. 12. Open IPTV forum consumer domain architecture.metadata, content delivery and AV codecs will be based onthe DVB IPTV specifications, while the declarative applicationenvironment will be based on CEHTML as defined by CEAConsumer Electronics Association. Optionally storage functionality for local PVR Personal Video Recorder and content download services and DLNA Digital Living Network Alliance Digital Media Player DMP and Digital Media ServerDMS functionality can be included. The latter two allow access to content from other DLNA devices DMP functionalityand make Open IPTV Forum services available to other DLNAdevices DMS functionality on the residential network.For managed network services, the IP Multimedia SubsystemIMS Gateway IG is introduced. The managed network isbased on IMS as defined by 3GPP and ETSI TISPAN. IMSprovides authentication, session management, resource and admission control, billing and user management functions. TheIG contains the IMS client for authentication and session management, and optionally the Universal Integrated Circuit CardUICC for IMS Services Identity Module ISIM based authentication. It provides session management for IPTV services likeCoD and scheduled content offerings, but also the integrationwith IMS based communication services like presence, callerID, chatting and messaging.In case support for local applications e.g. advanced interactive applications, home control is needed, the ApplicationGateway AG has to be used. It allows Java based applicationsto be installed from the network and run locally in the consumerdomain. The AG has the capability to control and intercept themedia stream for the purpose of inserting content generated orstored in the AG into that media stream. It can also interact withthe IG in order to access and control managed network services.While the OITF Open IPTV Terminal Function uses a specific Content and Service Protection CSP solution, it will alsobe possible to support alternative CSP solutions via the CSPGateway CP. The CP terminates the alternative CSP schemeAuthorized licensed use limited to Imperial College London. Downloaded on June 07,2010 at 193859 UTC from IEEE Xplore.

AN OVERVIEW OF IPTV STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT 327and uses DLNA link protection for secure communication between itself and the OITF and AG.The Wide Area Network WAN gateway WG representsthe residential gateway including network attachment and remote management functionality.The functional gateway entities can be implemented in different physical devices. The OITF, AG and IG can be for example part of an IPTV settop box. Networked TVs with integrated IPTV settop box functionality may implement the OITFfunction only. In this case IG, AG and CP have to be provided byadditional devices e.g. a residential gateway that already supports IMSSIP functions for Voice over IP as needed.With its objective to define an interoperable endtoend solution both for Managed Networks and the Open Internet, theintegration of communication services and the support of webbased applications and services, the Open IPTV Forum provides a unique approach to foster and widen the IPTV market.Having its work based on already existing specifications and ongoing work in other standardization bodies and fora will reducethe time to market and helps to increase the acceptance of theForums work.III. CONCLUSIONSWe have just reviewed the five major IPTV standard organizations and the corresponding specifications that werecompleted in 2008 some of which are still being extended in2009. It should be noted that in the meantime, another organizationThe Object Mobile Alliance OMAhas steppedforward to start a new work item on IPTV as a follow up to itswork on Mobile TV OMA BCAST. There are not only significant overlaps among existing specifications, developments alsoseem to evolve towards more divergence within IPTV systems.As before, the upcoming specifications share a lot of commonelements, but fall short of providing interoperability betweenthemselves because they differ in many details. There is thus astrong risk to see new standardbased technology islands emergealongside the existing proprietary islands. Because of the largenumber of alternatives, there is a fair chance that one or severalof those islands will eventually wither and die.However, there will still be issues of interoperability betweenIPTV systems, and possibly with mobile TV systems. The pursuit of a single IPTV standard may have failed, but there maystill be room to achieve convergence standards that will bringtogether those technology islands for the purpose of bridgingtheir functionality. This is work that the ETSI MCD TC initiative has started to explore.With so many available standards, vendors and operators willneed to make hard choices, and interoperability may not be possible before another generation of standards is born, or one winsover all the others. Both ways are open, and they may take lesstime than the previous round of exploratory standards. It mightbe a long and tortuous path.The published standards dealt with basic IPTV scenarios, butthe current standard work comes closer to stateoftheart developments. In the past years, a significant amount of researchhas been done on IPTV related issues, such as channel zapping, QoSQoE, admission control, and network interconnectivity 3238. Many articles in this Special Issue focus onmore advanced issues that researchers are exploring for the nextgeneration of IPTV systems and services.REFERENCES1 Transport of MPEG2 TSBased DVB Services Over IP Based Networks., ETSI TS 102 034.2 Remote Management and Firmware Update System for DVB IP Services, ETSI TS 102 824.3 Carriage of Broadband Content Guide BCG Information Over Internet Protocol, ETSI TS 102 539.4 Forward Error Correction for RealTime VideoAudio Transport OverIP Networks, SMPTE specification 202212007.5 Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTS MultimediaBroadcastMulticast Service MBMS Protocols and codecs 3GPPTS 26.346 Release 6, ETSI TS 126 346.6 Digital Video Broadcasting DVBIP Datacast over DVBH ContentDelivery Protocols, ETSI TS 102 472.7 DVBIPTV Profiles for TS 102 034, ETSI TS102 826.8 TISPAN Service Layer Requirements to integrate NGN Services andIPTV, ETSI TS 181 016, Ver. 2.0.0.9 TISPAN Service Layer Requirements to integrate NGN services andIPTV R3, ETSI TS 181 016 Ver. 3.0.1.10 TISPAN IPTV Architecture Dedicated subsystem for IPTV functions,ETSI TS 182 028 , Ver. 2.0.0.11 TISPAN IPTV Architecture Dedicated Subsystem for IPTV Functions,ETSI TS 182 028, Ver. 3.0.0.12 DVB Bluebook A128 0207 DVBIP Phase 1.3 in the Context of ETSITISPAN NGN.13 Session Initiation Protocol, IETF RFC 3261.14 TISPAN IPTV Architecture IPTV Functions Supported by the IMSSubsystem, ETSI TS 182 027, Ver. 2.0.15 TISPAN IPTV Architecture IPTV Functions Supported by the IMSSubsystem, ETSI TS 182 027, Ver. 3.0.16 Open IPTV Forum, Services and Functions for Release 1, Version 1.0., Online.
