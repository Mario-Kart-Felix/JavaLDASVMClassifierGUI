Abstract— In this paper, a simple cost-effective
solution is proposed, by which devices used in this project can
be controlled remotely while the user is anywhere across the
globe. Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Messaging
Service (MMS) is a mechanism of delivery of short messages
and also image over the mobile networks that are widely spread
across the globe. The main objective is to create a command or
programming language that will control the devices such as
GSM modem connected to computer sending an image to the
centre database through the GSM network provided. In order
to operate this project automatically, Visual Basic 6.0 was
chosen in the writing of the program as it is the easiest
programming language compared to other programming
language. It is also reliable to all devices used in this project.
After receiving the MMS, the received data will be stored in the
database before analyzing the image.

Index Terms—GSM, MMS, database, communications.

I. INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, the implementation of Speed
Trap Image Transfer through GSM Network has been
attempted by using the internet and through power-line
modems. However, these solutions are not only complex but
also require a physical connection to access those devices. In
case of controlling through internet, the main problems are
each controllable device requires separate Ethernet card and
IP addresses to control, it also requires internet connection to
each device. A simple, cost-effective solution is proposed by
which devices as mentioned above can be controlled
remotely, while the user is anywhere across the globe just by
sending appropriate SMS message, which is cheaper than
dialing and costs more or less the same with respect to
geographical distance.

Nowadays, SMS has become very popular [3]. It is a
store-and-forward way of transmitting messages to and from
mobiles [5]. Each short message can be no longer than 160
characters [2]. These characters can be text (alphanumeric) or
binary Non-Text Short messages. An interesting feature of
SMS is return receipts. This means that the sender has an
option of receiving a receipt notifying that the SMS was
successfully delivered to the intended recipient. Since SMS
uses signaling channels for its transmission/reception as
opposed to dedicated data channels, these messages can be
sent/received simultaneously with the voice/data/fax services
over GSM networks. Moreover, SMS supports national and
international roaming. With PCS networks based on all the




three technologies (GSM, CDMA and TDMA) supporting
SMS, SMS has been rendered a universal mobile data
service.

A. Problem Statement
Geographically, Malaysia and Thailand are connected
while Singapore is separated by Strait of Tebrau. From
several profitable aspect for Malaysia, Malaysian
government has built a North-South Expressway linking all
three country from the north to the south nationwide which
starts from Bukit Kayu Hitam, Kedah (Malaysia-Thailand's
border) to the south of the country ended at Johore Bharu
(Malaysia-Singapore's border).  Singapore is connected to
this highway via a causeway across the strait.
Besides the benefit obtained from the tourism industry
especially from Singapore and Thailand, there is also
problem arising with regard to over-speeding foreign
vehicles on the North-South Highway (NSH).   Despite a lot
of summon given to them, it seems that the problems never
come to an end simply because the Malaysian authority has
no real-time offence data to track the vehicle at the
check-point before leaving this country.
By using high speed digital camera, photo of
over-speeding foreign vehicle can be recorded and sent to
Malaysian Police Department and Malaysian Immigration
Department data bases using MMS. These data bases can be
accessed by the personnel at the check point simply by key-in
the vehicle registration number on real-time basis.  Upon
conviction, an appropriate amount of summon will be
imposed to the driver and has to be settled before leaving the
country.

Auto speed trap camera will capture image of the vehicle
that breaks of the Malaysian traffic law. Then the picture
is saved in the computer that connected to the GSM
modem.

ii. Second Process:

Any picture that appears at the image stored folder in the
computer will be immediately sent to the central database
through GSM network.

iii. Third Process:

At this stage the data received from the GSM network will
be processed and analyzed using image processing
software before link to the database to trace the owner’s
profile of the vehicles.


iv. Forth Process:

This is the last stage of the system which is used to trace
the owner profile of the vehicles at the central database
for appropriate action.
II. RELATED WORK
A. Global System for Mobile Communications
In 1991, the first GSM systems were ready to be brought
into friendly-user operation. In the same year, the meaning of
the acronym GSM was changed to stand for Global System
for Mobile Communications. The year 1991 also saw the
definition of the first derivative of GSM, the Digital Cellular
System 1800 (DCS 1800), which more or less translate the
GSM system into 1800 MHz frequency range. In the United
States, DCS 1800 was adapted to the 1900 MHz band
(Personal Communication System 1900, or PCS 1900) [3].
By 1992, many European countries had operational networks,
and GSM started to attract interest worldwide [1] [2]. Time
has brought substantial technological progress to the GSM
hardware. GSM has proved to be a major commercial success
for system manufacturers as well as for network operators.
B. GSM Architecture
The GSM network architecture can be divided into three
main components. These components are the subscribers
which hold the mobile station, namely the GSM terminal, the
base station subsystems, which controls the radio link with
the mobile station and the network subsystem, which
performs the switching of calls and other management task
such as authentication [14]. Figure 2 shows the main element
of the GSM architecture. Every line which connecting all
subsystem and element are the method of interfacing between
each other.


Figure 2. GSM Architecture
C. Mobile Station
The mobile station (MS) and the base station subsystem
communicate across the Um interface also known as the air
interface or radio link. The base station subsystem
communicates with the network subsystem across the Abis
interface. The mobile station consists of physical terminal
and contains the radio transceiver, the display and digital
signal processors and the subscriber identity module (SIM).
The SIM provides the user with the ability to access their
subscribed services irrespective of the location and the
terminal used [1]. The insertion of the SIM in any GSM
cellular phone allows the user to access a network, give and
receive phone calls and make use of all the subscribed
services.
D. Base Stations Subsystems
The base station subsystem is composed of two parts: the
base transceiver station (BTS) and the base station controller
(BSC). They communicate across the specified Abis
interface thus allowing network operators to use components
made by different suppliers. The base transceiver station

WCECS 2008, October 22 - 24, 2008, San Francisco, USA
ISBN: 978-988-98671-0-2 WCECS




houses the radio transceiver that defines a cell and handle the
radio link protocols with the mobile station. Depending on
the density of the area, more or fewer BTSs are needed to
provide the appropriate capacity to the cell. Digital
communication system (DCS) networks working at 1800
MHz need twice the number of BTSs to cover the same area
as GSM networks, but provide twice as much capacity.
E. Network Subsystem
The mobile service switching center (MSC) is the main
component of the network subsystem. It provides the same
functionality as a switching node in a PSTN or ISDN but also
takes care of all the functionality needed to handle a mobile
subscriber such as registration, authentication, location
updating, handovers and routing to a roaming subscriber. The
MSC also act as a gateway to the public switched telephone
network (PSTN) or integrated services digital network
(ISDN), and provides the interface to the short messaging
service centre (SMSC).
F. Short Message Services
Developed as part of the GSM Phase 2 specification [5],
SMS is based on the capability of a digital cellular terminal to
send or receive alphanumeric messages. The short messages
can be up to 140 bytes in length, and are delivered within a
few second where GSM coverage is available. More than a
common paging service, the delivery of the message is
guaranteed even when the cellular terminal is unavailable
(e.g. when the terminal is switched off or outside the area off
our outside the area of coverage). The network will hold the
message and deliver it shortly after the cellular terminal
announces its presence on the network. The fact that SMS
(through GSM) supports international roaming with very low
latency makes it particularly suitable for applications such as
paging, E-mail or voicemail notification, messaging services
for multiple users etc. However, the facilities offered to users
and the charges for these facilities still mainly depend on the
level of service provided by the network operator [4].

G. Multimedia Messaging Services
For the phone user, MMS is very similar to Short Message
Service (SMS)-it provides automatic, immediate delivery of
user-created content from phone to phone. The message
addressing used is primarily phone numbers, thus the traffic
goes from phone to phone. MMS also provides support for
e-mail addressing, so that messages can also be sent by
e-mail. In addition to the familiar text content of SMS, MMS
messages can contain still images, voice or audio clips, and
later also video clips and presentation information [14]. An
MMS message is a multimedia presentation in a single
entry-it is not a text file with attachments. MMS is bearer
independent and is not limited to only GSM or WCDMA
networks.

III. DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM
A. Microsoft Visual Basic
Visual Basic 6.0 is a visual programming languages based
It is the computer language of choice among those of us who
design software to interface to the real world. It provides and
easy operator uses a mouse or keyboard to select ‘buttons’ or
other ‘controls’ to cause things happen or see things happen
with easy to understand ‘ layouts’ and graphics. VB was
derived heavily from BASIC and enables the rapid
application development (RAD) of graphical user interface
(GUI) applications, which is also able to access to databases
using Data access Object (DAO) such as mySQL or
Microsoft Access, Remote Data Objects (RDO) for
controlling object, or ActiveX Data Object (ADO) which
works as a add-on to visual Basic program, and creation of
ActiveX controls and objects. A programmer can put
together an application using the components provide with
Visual Basic itself. Programs written in Visual basic can also
be used with Windows application programming Interface
(API), but doing so requires external function declarations.
Visual Basic 6.0 was chosen in the writing of the program as
it is the easiest programming language compared to other
programming language. It is also reliable to all devices used
in this project.
B. ActiveX Control
An ActiveX control is essential a simple OLE object that
supports the unknown interface. It is usually support many
more interfaces in order to offer functionality, but all
additional interfaces can be viewed as optional and such a
container should not rely on any additional interface being
supported. By not specifying additional interfaces that a
control must support a control can efficiently target a
particular are of functionality without having to support
particular interface to quality as a control. As always with
OLE, whether in a control or a container, it should never be
assumed that an interface is available, and standard
return-checking conventions should always be followed. It is
important for a control or container to degrade gracefully and
offer alternative functionality if a required interface is not
available.

C. Rabbit Microprocessor RCM3200
Rabbit Semiconductor was formed expressly to design a
better microprocessor for use in small and medium-scale
controllers. The first microprocessor was the Rabbit 2000.
The second microprocessor, now available, is the Rabbit
3200. Rabbit microprocessor designers have had years of
experience using Z80, Z180, and HD64180 microprocessors
in small controllers. The Rabbit shares a similar architecture
and a high degree of compatibility with these
microprocessors, but it is a vast improvement [6]. Figure 3
shows prototype of Rabbit Microprocessor RCM 3200.

The Rabbit 3200 hardware and software interfaces
are as uncluttered and are as foolproof as possible. The
Rabbit has outstanding computation speed for a
microprocessor with an 8-bit bus. This is because the
Z80-derived instruction set is very compact, and the timing of
the memory interface allows higher clock speeds for a given
memory speed. RCM 3200 must be pair with RCM 3000
which act as a trainer. Figure 4 shows prototype of Rabbit
Microprocessor RCM 3000.

D. WaveCom M1306B GSM/GPRS Modem
Hardware used for this project is WaveCom M1306B
GSM/GPRS Modem or Fastrack Modem. This modem was
design by using dual band 900/1800MHz Fastrack M1306B
offers GPRS Class 10 Capability with Open AT and IT
protocols such as IP connectivity as standard features. Beside
that, it also work as fully functional GSM/GPRS modem with
data, voice, fax and SMS capability, the Fastrack features
comes with an internal SIM tray and SIM interface, a 15-pin
sub-D RS232 interface for serial communication, and a 4-pin
Molex connector allowing it to be powered from a
5.5-32VDC supply or one of our mains adaptors [7]. Figure 5
is the physical look of WaveCom GSM/GPRS modem

IV. METHODOLOGY
The project is divided into two main components hardware
and software. Both the hardware and software are further
broken down into several individual subsystems. Each
subsystem is tested and implemented separately, and
integrated together to construct the final project. This section
describes the development stage of hardware, and software
that compliment the hardware.

The main part of this project was to send the image of
over-speeding vehicles through GSM network. There are five
phases involved in its implementation i.e. Preliminary
Investigation, Analysis, Design, Implementation and lastly
Maintenance. The methodology of work is as shown in
Figure 6.


Figure 6. Phases in Methodology

This project is divided into two major parts; hardware
design and software development. The hardware part
involves developing and testing the hardware to determine
the operation of the hardware and to obtain the output format
of the hardware. Programming involves two stages; compile
and simulate. The design of the system program consists of
image capturing, image sending and receiving in a form of
MMS through GSM network, and image storing in the
database. In the implementation stage, the steps involved
connecting GSM modem to Comport, Clearing Message
Inbox, Sending the image in form of MMS, New Message
Indication and Receiving MMS and Store the received MMS
V. EXPECTED RESULTS
At the end of this project, Speed Trap Image Transfer
through GSM Network will function as what it was designed
which is able to send and receive the MMS by using GSM
modem to the other GSM modem at the central database
system once the picture of a vehicle is captured. The image
that been captured then will be stored in a picture
storage/folder before the next process of the system takes
place and the detail of the vehicle owner will be traced at the
centre data base.
VI. CONCLUSION
The proposed project was indeed possible to be implemented
using the available enabling technology such as GSM
modem, GSM network and software such as Visual Basic
6.0, Dynamic C and ActiveX Control. The project will
somehow help the relevant authority in Malaysia to nab the
errant drivers that flout the highway’s law of the country and
eventually help in eradicating highway accident due to
over-speeding.
