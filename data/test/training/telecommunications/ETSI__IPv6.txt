As a result, new entrants are unable to join the Internet. The Internet has become a critical global infrastructure and its upgrade is essential to keep the Internet growing. It is particularly important for the new technologies that will adopt it such as the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and 5G. IPv6 provides enhanced features compared with IPv4 and its use will allow the Internet to grow. Global deployment of IPv6 has begun, with some countries achieving more than 30% user penetration: http://labs.apnic.net/dists/v6dcc.html . Already over 260 million users are accessing the Internet over IPv6, probably without even knowing it. It is important to avoid numerous temporary fixes and to manage the transition to IPv6 cleanly. Harmonization and interoperability will be crucial to the emerging technologies that will rely on the Internet. Our Role & Activities Industry Specification Group on IPv6 Integration (ISG IP6) ISG IP6 is addressing the transition from IPv4 to IPv6, which will support the sustainability and growth of the Internet and enable it to cater for the new technologies based on it. The group’s task is to: outline best practices gather support create awareness of the impact of IPv6 for critical stakeholders such as enterprises, Internet service providers, governments, safety and emergency services and the education sector We have also begun work on the impact of IPv6 on emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things, smart grids, OpenStack-based Cloud computing, Software-Defined Networking-Network Functions Virtualization and the 5G mobile wireless Internet. Integrated Broadband Cable Telecommunication Networks committee (TC CABLE) TC CABLE is: developing tests for each of the five transition technologies (NAT64, MAP-E, DS-Lite, 464XLAT and 6RD) for communication between IPv6 and IPv4 preparing a strategy to guide network operators when deploying these transition technologies in operational networks Standards The following is a list of the latest published ETSI specifications on transition to IPv6. A full list of related standards in the public domain is accessible via the ETSI standards search . Via this interface you can also subscribe for alerts on updates of ETSI standards.
