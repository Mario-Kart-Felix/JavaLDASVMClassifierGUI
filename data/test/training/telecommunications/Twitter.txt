For ten years, the County had connected schools and other public facilities with leased lines from the local cable company but Comcast was threatening to radically increase its prices after the lease expired in 2010. Knowing that the County had few  choices and little bargaining power under Florida law, County Chief  Information Officer Kevin Kryzda had to find an alternative to a Comcastinspired 800 increase in costs in coming years.Kryzda embarked on what he termed the rubber chicken circuit to encourage local leaders and elected officials to consider building a countyowned network rather than continuing to lease services indefinitely. Analyses suggested the investment would save money for the taxpayers, provide a nextgeneration fiber optic network that was almost limitless, dramatically increase the reliability of  network connections, and eliminate the Countys dependence on Comcast.Despite strong opposition from Comcast, the County moved forward with the plan with support from the school district and local businesses. By exploring a variety of partnerships with other public entities, Kryzda reduced the original estimated cost of 9.8 million to 4.14 million. The school district paid for 1.3 million of  the capital costs out of  an existing capital budget and will recoup its investment in five years. Savings after year six will be at least 340,000 per year. The school district pays 6,120 per year to connect 26 sites with gigabit connections. Comparing connections supplied by ATT to the remaining two school district sites not connected by the County, the County network delivers 14,161 times the capacity provided by ATT per dollar.The dark fiber from Comcast had no redundancy and was deployed on poles, leaving it vulnerable to hurricanes. The new  Countyowned network was built underground with redundancy, a dramatic improvement.A local hospital is leasing dark fiber from the network, allowing it to explore nextgeneration services at an affordable rate. Revenue from the hospital put the County in the black, meaning that the County has not had to increase its telecommunications costs relative to what it had been previously been paying despite now  having a far superior network. Over twenty years, the cost savings are estimated at over 30 million compared to leasing connections.The community has become more selfreliant and has more control over its future budgets, no longer fearing rate hikes from Comcast or other providers. Though a partnership with an existing local Internet Service Provider provider, some in the County have additional choices for broadband.  Martin County has no plans to offer services directly to residents or businesses, but the presence of its network has fundamentally altered the market, to the benefit of  residents and local businesses.Institute for Local Self Reliance  1                   Introduc8onMartin County covers 750 square miles, including 200 square miles of  water, from beaches on the east to Lake Okeechobee on the west. Tourism and retirement have played a major role in the Countys economy.  A mild climate attracts retirees at a high rate relative to the rest of the state. People over the age of  65 comprise about 27 percent of the countys 150,000 residents. The county operates water and wastewater utilities but does not have its own electric utility. The County Information Technology IT Department has long operated i ts own telecommunications network, largely over lines leased from the cable company. In the Beginning was Dark FiberLike any local government, Martin County has public facilities schools, police, fire, etc. scattered across its footprint that need to communicate with each other and the outside world. Since 1999, Martin County operated its own network at minimal cost using dark fiber lines leased from the incumbent cable company as part of its video franchise agreement. The original franchise was negotiated with Adelphia, which Comcast assumed after Adelphia went bankrupt amidst scandal and mismanagement.Dark fiber is another term for fiber optic cable without any network gear attached. Martin County leased the dark fiber from Comcast and used its own networking gear to provide services to public buildings. At least two fiber strands, sometimes as many as eight, ran from the County Administrative Center to each of the 54 county locations for a total cost of 10,500 per month 121,500 each year.Regardless of  whether it used 10Mbps, 100Mbps, or 1000Mbps 1 gigabit, Martin Countys bill to Comcast remained fixed at 10,500 per month. If it wanted higher capacities, the County simply had to invest in more expensive electronics lasers, routers, etc.. However, a weakness in the Comcast system was that the connections were aerial and lacking in redundancy.1  Institute for Local Self Reliance  1                   FloridaMartin CountySaint LucieCountyPalm BeachCountyLake OkeechobeeAtlantic OceanThe franchise agreement with Comcast was set to expire in 2009 and changes in the regulatory environment had reduced the Countys negotiating power relative to Comcast. The Florida Consumer Choice Act of  2007 moved franchise authority to the State and limited what communities could require of telecommunications providers that wanted to use the publics RightofWay see box. Unlike Adelphia, Comcast tends not to lease dark fiber. Rather than allowing Martin County to continue leasing dedicated strands of fiber, Comcast wanted the County to move to managed services. The managed services approach would give more control to Comcast, which could then charge more for higher tiers of capacity. And Comcast would likely engage in oversubscription, a common practice where the provider takes a single 100Mbps connection and sells it to multiple customers, promising each up to 100Mbps. This arrangement means that subscribers could see speeds of  100Mbps but congestion would result in slower speeds most of  the time.  An analogy would be selling access to a highway with a speed limit of 65mph but rush hour conditions render the top theoretical speed meaningless.Moving from dark fiber, where Martin County owned and operated its own electronics, to managed services would strand the investments in equipment made by the County and school district. Comcast was not the only provider in Florida to phase out dark fiber contracts. After ATT took over BellSouth in Florida, it too ceased leasing dark fiber and pushed managed services contracts.Institute for Local Self Reliance                       2Florida Consumer Choice ActIn order to offer cable and broadband, cable companies need access to poles and other assets that are located on property throughout the community. This property is commonly called the rightofway ROW. Cable companies have historically had to negotiate with each local government for permission to use the rightofway. They typically paid a recurring franchise fee, made a few television channels available to the public, agreed to minimum quality standards, and sometimes provided some form of broadband network for the local government.The Florida Consumer Choice Act of 2007 eliminated the need for companies to negotiate with each community for access to poles, conduits and other assets on public property. The Act was justified as a way to encourage competition in cable television and broadband. However, states that have adopted this statewide franchise model have the same general set of DSLcable choices and see the same regular rate increases as states that have not revoked local authority to manage the rightofway. For more information, see Statewide Video Franchising Legislation A Comparative Study of Outcomes in Texas, California, and Michigan by the Center for Science, Technology,  Public Policy at the University of Minnesota.Dark Fiber v Managed ServicesWhen Martin County was leasing dark fiber, it decided what equipment to use on its network. It is that equipment that sends laser pulses over the fiber, bringing it to life. The County could decide whether to pay x for equipment that will allow 100 megabit connections or pay y to move data at gigabits per second. However, decisions about equipment go far beyond just capacity. Some equipment is more reliable, some allows for Qualify of Service specifications, and so on. Comcast prefers to sell what it calls managed services, where it would tell Martin County it can pay x for 100Mbps, y for 1Gbps, etc. However, Comcast would decide what equipment is used, taking control out of the hands of the County and limiting its options. Generally, the markup on buying capacity from a cable or telephone company is far higher than what it would cost an entity like Martin County to do over dark fiber.Comcast Nego8a8onsMartin County Chief  Information Officer CIO Kevin Kryzda wrote a letter to Comcast in 2006, stating the Countys intention to negotiate a new agreement to continue leasing dark fiber. Comcast did not respond  and had little reason to  because the Florida Consumer Choice Act of 2007 would soon pass, eliminating local authority to negotiate a video franchise agreement. Statewide franchising would leave the County in a much worse negotiating position.Toward the end of  2009, Comcast offered to extend the dark fiber lease through 2010, on a monthtomonth basis, for 12,075 per month a 18,900 increase for the year. At the end of the year, Comcast intended to raise the monthly rate to 18,113, providing fresh motivation to Kryzda to find a long term solution for the Countys telecommunications needs.Kryzda knew  the County had few  options. The County had little bargaining power with Comcast and no other company had the willingness or capacity to replace the dark fiber network. Both Comcast and ATT only wanted to sell the more profitable managed services.Shortly thereafter, Comcast proposed a new  5year lease agreement that would phase out the dark fiber network. Over the course of  the proposed lease, monthly payments would jump from 12,075 in the first year to 98,261 in the fifth year, an increase of 814 over the proposed 5year contract see Table 1. After the fifth year, the County would purchase managed services from Comcast.Kevin Kryzda characterized Comcasts strategy as take it or leave it.2But behind the scenes, Kryzda had already been exploring a long term solution a countyowned network. Even before Comcast presented the ultimatum to the community, he had developed an alternative vision that would result in a better network for the County at a lower cost.The Rubber Chicken CircuitKevin Kryzda became the catalyst, pushing Martin County to embrace his alternative vision. Kryzda had joined Martin County in 1983 as an Engineering Technician and worked his way up through the Information Technology Department. He was named CIO in 1999. In 2006, Kryzda anticipated the shift in balance of power that would come with the Florida Consumer Choice Act of  2007. Even though he had not yet negotiated with Comcast, he knew what to expect. More engineer than public speaker, Kryzda nonetheless began planning to hit what he termed the rubber chicken circuit to give a series of presentations to explain why the County should build its own network. 3 Institute for Local Self Reliance                       3Comcast Proposal for Contract RenewalProposed INET extension from Comcast 12200919992009  dark fiber leaseFY10 FY11 FY12 FY13 FY14 FY15Comcast Monthly Charge10,500 12,075 18,113 45,282 98,261 98,261 98,261 increase from previous year15 50 150 117 0 0Table 1  This table shows Comcasts proposal to the County  to continue leasing services after the Fiber Lease extension would expire. After FY15, the County  would have to transition to managed services, presumably  at still higher cost, rather than continuing to lease dark fiber.Kryzda also knew  the County would have to at least appear ready to go its own way in order to gain a better deal from Comcastthe moment of realization came for me early on, in 2007 or 2008, that I had to get support for doing something about the eventual departure from Comcast.  The best outcome, at the time, might have been for Comcast to finally relent and offer the same network at a reasonable price even double what the County was paying at the outset might have been reasonable.4 Kryzda tapped other local governments that had considered building communityowned networks to learn how  to explain network technology and economics to local leaders without either frightening them or putting them to sleep. He also started to prepare the Board of  Commissioners for Comcasts inevitable backlash. Before long, local officials asked him to attend meetings requested by Comcast. Kryzda was a man on a mission. He talked with Board members from the local hospital system, members of the Economic Development Commission, and large local employers who would have use for high bandwidth and redundant connections. Though the County had no plans to offer services directly to any businesses or residents, the network could potentially lease dark fiber to businesses or a new  service provider that would add competition to the community.PuHng the Pieces TogetherIn 2008, Kryzda worked with the Martin County Bond Council and a local law  firm to estimate the cost of  a publicly owned network. Though Comcasts dark fiber comprised the majority of the existing network, the County and school district had supplemented those connections over the years with their own fiber optic investments. The County and school already owned all the gear necessary to operate the network, they just needed to replace the spans owned by Comcast. County IT staff, with help from Technology Assurance Labs in Orlando, estimated the new network would cost 9.8 million. Looking for opportunities to bring down the cost of the network, Kryzda turned to Don Donaldson, Martin Countys Engineering Director. The Florida Department of Transportation FDOT had received a grant from the Federal Highway A d m i n i s t r a t i o n  F H A  d e s i g n a t e d f o r transportation and public safety to expand the current Intelligent Transportation System, originally built in 1999. Intelligent Transportation Systems use communications and computers, along with sensing and detecting technologies, to manage intersections with realtime information. Goals include less traffic congestion, reduced pollution, and improved safety. Knowing that FDOT designated the grant for installing conduit and fiber in more intersections throughout the County, Kryzda initiated a conversation about merging pieces of  their networks to share costs. Donaldson was initially apprehensive because FDOT maintains a strict interpretation of US Code Article 29, requiring FHA grants for transportation to be used exclusively for transportation services. Kryzda believed they could find a way to collaborate. Rather than sharing fiber, he inquired, might the County network be allowed to share conduit that would be laid for the transportation project The two systems would not be commingling assets, simply sharing empty space. Donaldson agreed.Using new  routes along the targeted traffic corridors, Kryzda contracted with a design engineer to adjust the network design. The contract cost 33,000 but cut 2.5 million off the networks price tag, reducing it to 7.3 million.  Kryzda credits this kind of  collaboration and creative thinking for making the network attractive to elected officials and ultimately for its construction. The Martin County School District, which used the same network as the County, was enthusiastic about the Countyowned network proposal. Due to state mandates for online Institute for Local Self Reliance                       4testing and online instruction for every grade, the school district needed access to a high capacity, nextgeneration network. In a letter of  support Steve Weil, Executive Director of  Operations at the Martin County School District stated, The Districts use of the high speed network has changed from luxury to necessity. 5  A 2012 report from the State Educational Technology Directors Association supports Weils conclusion, noting that school district networks should have 1 Gbps connections between facilities by 201415 and 10Gbps by 201718.6Weils enthusiastic letter anticipated benefits such as controlling service levels and speed, prioritizing traffic, and making upgrades easier. The school district accounted for 30 percent of the dark fiber and agreed to contribute 30 percent of the cost of creating the new  network even before the decision to build the network was approved by the Board. The school district would be 30 percent owners, with a pro rata share in any future benefits or expenses. Because it had funds available from an existing capital budget before the project began, the schools participation also reduced the total borrowing required.Planning, Financing, and BuildingOn April 20, 2010, Kryzda presented the Long Term County Network Proposal to the Martin County Commission. Letters of  support from the Business Development Board of Martin County, the school district, and the Economic Council of Martin County documented the need for a countyowned network. The proposed network would not merely duplicate what Comcast previously provided. The new  network would be far superior and faulttolerant. A single accident on Comcasts network c o u l d c u t o f f f i r s t  r e s p o n d e r s f r o m communications. The Countys network would be built underground and use a ring topology that would allow  for uninterrupted service even if  an accident severed a cable.A business analysis by consulting firm Rice, Williams Associates concluded that a primary source of anticipated revenue would come from leasing connections to the Martin County Public Schools while a small revenue stream could come from other institutional clients, and several local townships. The firm believed the network a sound investment due to the Countys strong credit rating, the downward price trend in the construction market, the situation with the Comcast lease, and the potential value of  the network. Not only would the County save money, it would have far greater capacity and greater reliability than if it continued leasing services from Comcast.The Commission voted unanimously to issue an RFP for the construction of the network, which would give major carriers an opportunity to bid, even if just to offer dark fiber. Unsurprisingly, the Countys plan to build its own network led Comcast to quickly change its negotiating tactics. After the Board authorized the RFP in April 2010, Comcast suddenly revised its previous take it or leave it offer, cutting prices in half. Rather than stepping into the fifth year at 98,261, the revised offer was 45,000 and would transition to managed services in the sixth year. Comcasts changed posit ion shows the importance of  local government establishing a viable alternative to depending on a distant corporation. Martin Countys examination of  a publicly owned network would have saved the County 2 million over the next five years if it had accepted Comcasts revised offer as compared to the first.Martin County Commissioners, however, had already seen the benefits of  a carrier independent network and were moving forward.ATT submitted a bid to provide services as a vendor, but its approach was similar to Comcasts original highpriced approach. Comcast did not submit a bid. Kryzda notes that Comcast instead spent significant time during the RFP bid period lobbying the Board of Commissioners to reconsider their risky investment.Institute for Local Self Reliance                       5A local publicprivate relationship presented itself during the RFP. Indiantown Telecommunications Service ITS is a relatively small, rural local exchange carrier located in the center of the county. Between 2006 and 2010, ITS invested in its own fiber network, installing fiber optic cable in and around the cen te r o f the coun ty. ITS approached Martin County and Kryzda, offering a 43mile fiber swap. ITS would use Martin County fiber to expand its service area and Martin County would use existing ITS fiber to avoid trenching and installation costs. The savings associated with the agreement brought the expected cost of  building the network down to 4.14 million. To pay for its share, the County arranged a 15 year, 3.12 million bank loan with First Southwest Company at 3.25 interest, resulting in annual debt service of 270,000. Kryzda had adopted an aggressive goal of completing the Community Broadband Network CBN before the end of  July, 2011, when the Comcast Fiber Lease extension would expire. The County was so convinced it would succeed it did not budget for lease payments beyond July of 2011. It was an ambitious strategy, but the selfimposed deadline worked. The construction for the project commenced on January 3rd, 2011 and the County no longer required Comcasts leased lines after July 31. However, the full network took a little longer to complete. The County first connected each sites with a single connection to make the deadline and then later added the redundant connections to complete a network comprised of seven rings.

At a February, 2011 meeting, while the network was still being built, Martin County Commissioners voted unanimously to spend 250,000 to expand the network to Port St. Lucies network. The town of Port St. Lucie, sits about 7 miles past the County line, but the Board wanted to seek out possible economic opportunities. The new  connection would link the Martin Memorial Hospital to its Health System in Tradition, a Port St. Lucie community.7  The Health System has 19 facilities in Martin and St. Lucie Counties, some administrative and others clinical. In addition to traditional use of Internet applications, the System makes use of telehealth applications. The Martin Health System MHS uses EPIC, a stateoftheart clinical medical record system, for sharing health records making clinical processes more efficient and effective for patient care.8  EPIC allows the Health System to be compliant with the federal mandate to convert all medical records in the U.S. to electronic format by 2014. According to Kryzda, that one relationship put them in the black.9 In short, the hospital lease covered the gap between what the County had been paying to lease the dark fiber network from Comcast and the higher debt service cost from building its own network. Without the dark fiber lease to MHS, the network would have still been a good investment compared to the cost of leasing from Comcast but the MHS lease actually reduced the Countys expenses.10The total annual operating and maintenance costs of the network are estimated at 51,000 each year. The equipment used to operate the network has long been budgeted for separately as part of the County and school district IT budgets.The school district expects to recoup its 1.3 million capital investment in less than 5 years. If the original Comcast offer had been accepted, the school district would have continued to pay 30 percent of the lease, increasing its costs to 348,886 annually by 2013.11 Instead, the school is paying a meager 12 percent of the operations and maintenance costs of  the network each year.12 For 6,120 each year, the school connects 26 facilities with 1Gbps connections.The school has two additional sites served by ATT MetroE connections at a much slower 10 Mbps.13 The cost of that service, which is 1100 th as fast as the Countyowned network, is 5,268 per month.14 At first glance, this suggests that the County network is not only 100 times faster than ATT, but also 10 times less expensive. But the true difference is even greater, as illustrated in Table 3. During the five year amortization period for the school districts capital investment, the County network provides 9.77 Mbps for each 100 compared to the .03 Mbps delivered by ATT. But after the costs are amortized, the Institute for Local Self Reliance                       7County Network Superior to ATT Connec8onsYearly Cost Yearly CostSite Mbps Mbps  100ATT 63,216 31,608 10 0.03CBN Year 15 266,120 10,235.38 1000 9.77CBN Year 5 6,120 235.38 1000 424.84Table 3  Of  the school districts  28 sites, 26 are connected to the County  Broadband Network at 1Gbps and 2 are connected using MetroE from ATT at 10Mbps. Breaking out the cost and capacity  on a per site basis, ATT delivers only  .03 Mbps for each 100 spent whereas the County  network delivers 9.77 Mbps during the years over which the capital cost is amortized and 424.84 Mbps in later years.Countys network delivers 14,161 times the capacity of ATT per dollar.Kat ie Preston, Director of  Educat ional Technology at the Martin County School District says of the networkThe CBN provides a scalable fully redundant network with a life expectancy of 25 years. This jointly owned and maintained network replaced the traditional, nonredundant, carrier provided, connectivity that was consuming a large portion of the school districts operating budget. The new network has allowed us to meet the ever increasing needs related to online curriculum and testing and will allow us to meet future requirements through simple and affordable equipment upgrades.15Public safety in Martin County has improved as well. By sharing conduit and routes, twice as many intersections are hooked into the Intelligent Transportation System as would have been absent the collaboration.16New, unanticipated uses for the County network appear on a regular basis. Three public safety towers are now  on the network, saving 73,000 in annual connectivity and surveillance costs. When the past public safety network carrier, ATT, proposed moving the signal to its new  MetroE2 system, the price jumped dramatically. Martin County moved its public safety system on to the new  County network instead. Call center operators insist the new  connections are far superior than what was offered by ATT.The network runs approximately 154 miles throughout the county. In addition to serving the County facilities and the school district, the towns of Jupiter Island, Sewells Point, the City of  Stuart, and Martin Health Systems take full advantage of the CBNs capabilities. The Future of Mar8n Countys New NetworkOne of Kryzdas unforeseen responsibilities throughout the process has been managing expectations. At the beginning of the discussion to build a community network, it was obvious that the Commission wanted to capitalize on greater connectivity for the entire County. The Commission stated that it wanted to avoid a proprietary network, serving only community anchor institutions. Early ideas were to find a way to offer bandwidth to public institutions, government, businesses and residents. Legal restrictions, however, make it difficult for the County to offer telecommunications services to residents and businesses see Barriers to Public Ownership Box. Institute for Local Self Reliance                       8Barriers to Public OwnershipI f t h e C o u n t y w a n t s t o p r o v i d e telecommunications services to nongovernmental entities, it must adhere to Florida Stat. 350.81.2 Dark fiber is not considered a telecommunications service.Florida Stat. 350.81 dictates a stringent and burdensome set of rules, regulations, and requirements that discourage publicly owned networks from providing services to residents and businesses.  Among the various restrictions on publicly owned networks is one that requires a referendum if  the network is funded with revenue bonds that take longer than 15 years to mature. Under the law, publicly owned networks must be selfsustaining within four years, a provision that is not required of  the private sector. If  four years is not sufficient, the networks owners must make plans to stop providing services, find a private partner, dispose of the system, or obtain approval for some other use of  the system. A fouryear deadline is particularly difficult to meet when a community network invests in expensive fibertothehome services. In January 2011, the Board of  Commissioners hired Cherrystone Management Consultants Inc. to provide a study on new  ways to generate r e v e n u e w i t h t h e n e t w o r k . S o m e recommendations in the report included selling broadband capacity to wireline and wireless carriers, ISPs, the State of  Florida, and commercial entities. Cherrystone also suggested Martin County become a Global Broadband Gateway Port Community. Another possibility was seeking a partnership with Comcast to offer services on the new  network, although that suggestion was not received with much enthusiasm on either side. Kryzda does not anticipate providing commercial services to residents or businesses directly. Based on a legal analysis done by Baller Herbst Law  Group, a preeminent telecommunications law  resource, such a move could be difficult under existing law  see Barriers to Public Ownership box. Florida has created special regulations for publicly owned networks in addition to all the regulations on private companies that would already apply to the County. Thus far, Martin County is only considering leasing dark fiber on a casebycase basis and possibly offering Internet access to government entities. ConclusionFrom the start, Kryzda kept his eye on the prize obtaining the best deal for the County and the taxpayers. He credits collaboration with partners, l ike the School Board and the County Transportation Department, as keys to success along with creative thinking. Finding existing assets and incorporating them into a network design saves money and firms up relationships across agency lines. This network was a success from day one. The County maintains control over its network, including budgeting for future upgrades rather than fearing the next round of  negotiations with Comcast. The cost of the network to the County is far less than what it would have had to pay Comcast to deliver a comparatively inferior service. Between the school districts contribution and the hospitals dark fiber lease, the County has virtually unlimited capacity and could actually generate additional revenue by leasing additional strands of  fiber. Through the partnership with ITS, residents and businesses in parts of  the County have gained an additional Internet Service Provider to choose from. Local governments across the nation face a classic whyrentwhenyoucanown analysis for telecommunications services. These services will be necessary for as far into the future as anyone can presently imagine. One of the important lessons from Martin County is that smart public investments can result in large savings, and smart partnerships can result in even more savings. Additionally, the cost of the network would have been higher had Martin County not previously built its own spans of  fiber optic cable incrementally as opportunities presented themselves.Institute for Local Self Reliance                       9Mar8n County Network SavingsAnnual AverageTotalSavingsOver 20 years 1.5 Million 30.3 MillionOver 15 years 1.3 Million 19.8 MillionOver 10 years 1.1 Million 11.3 MillionTable 4 Projected savings of the Martin County Broadband network compared to leasing services from Comcast.Palm Beach CountyNearby Palm Beach County also has its own network connecting public facilities.

Individual agencies, such as FDOT and the school district, had built their own smaller internal networks that served their own purposes. The new network linked them together, creating a network of 154 miles of fiber, including 54 miles of new construction. Using the total miles of fiber, the county prorated for each agency based on the miles needed to connect facilities to the network.13 As neither site is on land owned by the County, they decided not to connect them with the network.14 In 2012, 49 of the ATT connection is reimbursed by Erate, but that percentage changes from year to year. Erate is a federal program that subsidizes the cost of connections to schools and libraries.15 Email from Katie Preston, May 17, 2012.16 Martin County makes troublefree transition to broadband cable system, By Jim Mayfield, Treasure Coast Palm, July 29, 2011.
