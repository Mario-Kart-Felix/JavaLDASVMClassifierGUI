INTRODUCTIONElectrodynamics was discovered and formalized in the19th century. The 20th century was then profoundly affected by its applications. A similar adventure is possibly happening for quantum mechanics, discovered andformalized during the last century. Indeed, although thelaser and semiconductors are already common, applications of the most radical predictions of quantum mechanics have been thought of only recently and their full powerremains a fresh gold mine for the physicists and engineersof the 21st century.The most peculiar characteristics of quantum mechanics are the existence of indivisible quanta and of entangled systems. Both of these are at the root of QuantumCryptography QC which could very well be the firstcommercial application of quantum physics at the individual quantum level. In addition to quantum mechanics, the 20th century has been marked by two other majorscientific revolutions the theory of information and relativity. The status of the latter is well recognized. Itis less known that the concept of information, nowadaysmeasured in bits, and the formalization of probabilities isquite recent1, although they have a tremendous impacton our daily life. It is fascinating to realize that QC lies atthe intersection of quantum mechanics and informationtheory and that, moreover, the tension between quantum mechanics and relativity  the famous EPR paradoxEinsteinet al.1935  is closely connected to the securityof QC. Let us add a further point for the young physicists.Contrary to laser and semiconductor physics, which aremanifestations of quantum physics at the ensemble leveland can thus be described by semiclassical models, QC,and even much more quantum computers, require a fullquantum mechanical description this may offer interesting jobs for physicists well trained in the subtleties oftheir science.This review article has several objectives. First wepresent the basic intuition behind QC. Indeed the basicidea is so beautiful and simple that every physicist andevery student should be given the pleasure to enjoy it.The general principle is then set in the broader context ofmodern cryptology section II B and made more precisesection II C. Chapter III discusses the main technological challenges. Then, chapters IV and V present the mostcommon implementation of QC using weak laser pulsesand photon pairs, respectively. Finally, the importantand difficult problems of eavesdropping and of securityproofs are discussed in chapter VI, where the emphasis ismore on the variety of questions than on technical issues.We tried to write the different parts of this review in such1The Russian mathematician A.N. Kolmogorow 1956 iscredited with being the first to have consistently formulateda mathematical theory of probabilities in the 1940s.a way that they can be read independently.II. A BEAUTIFUL IDEAThe idea of QC was first proposed only in the 1970sby Wiesner2 1983 and by Charles H. Bennett fromIBM and Gilles Brassard fromMontreal University 1984,19853. However, this idea is so simple that actually every first year student since the infancy of quantum mechanics could have discovered it Nevertheless, it is onlynowadays that the matter is mature and information security important enough, and  interestingly  only nowadays that physicists are ready to consider quantum mechanics, not only as a strange theory good for paradoxes,but also as a tool for new engineering. Apparently, information theory, classical cryptography, quantum physicsand quantum optics had first to develop into mature sciences. It is certainly not a coincidence that QC and, moregenerally, quantum information has been developed by acommunity including many computer scientists and moremathematics oriented young physicists. A broader interest than traditional physics was needed.A. The intuitionQuantum Physics is wellknown for being counterintuitive, or even bizarre. We teach students that Quantum Physics establishes a set of negative rules statingthings that cannot be done. For example1. Every measurement perturbs the system.2. One cannot determine simultaneously the positionand the momentum of a particle with arbitrary highaccuracy.3. One cannot measure the polarization of a photon inthe verticalhorizontal basis and simultaneously inthe diagonal basis.2Stephen Wiesner, then at Columbia University, was thefirst one to propose ideas closely related to QC, already inthe 1970s. However, his revolutionary paper appeared only adecade later. Since it is difficult to find, let us mention his abstract The uncertainty principle imposes restrictions on thecapacity of certain types of communication channels. This paper will show that in compensation for this quantum noise,quantum mechanics allows us novel forms of coding withoutanalogue in communication channels adequately described byclassical physics.3Artur Ekert 1991 from Oxford University discovered QCindependently, though from a different perspective see paragraph IID3.24. One cannot draw pictures of individual quantumprocesses.5. One cannot duplicate an unknown quantum state.This negative viewpoint on Quantum Physics, due toits contrast to classical physics, has only recently beenturned positive and QC is one of the best illustrationsof this psychological revolution. Actually, one could caricature Quantum Information Processing as the scienceof turning Quantum conundrums into potentially usefulapplications.Let us illustrate this for QC. One of the basic negativestatement of Quantum Physics readsEvery measurement perturbs the system 1except if the quantum state is compatible with the measurement. The positive side of this axiom can be seenwhen applied to a communication between Alice andBob the conventional names of the sender and receiver,respectively, provided the communication is quantum.The latter means that the support of information arequantum systems, like, for example, individual photons.Indeed, then axiom 1 applies also to the eavesdroppers,i.e. to a malicious Eve the conventional name given tothe adversary in cryptology. Hence, Eve cannot get anyinformation about the communication without introducing perturbations which would reveal her presence.To make this intuition more precise, imagine that Alicecodes information in individual photons which she sendsto Bob. If Bob receives the photons unperturbed, then,by the basic axiom 1, the photons were not measured.No measurement implies that Eve did not get any information about the photons note that acquiring information is synonymous to carrying out measurements.Consequently, after exchanging the photons, Alice andBob can check whether someone was listening theysimply compare a randomly chosen subset of their datausing a public channel. If Bob received the randomlychosen subset unperturbed then the logic goes as followsNo perturbation  No measurement No eavesdropping 2It is as simple as thatActually, there are two more points to add. First, inorder to ensure that axiom 1 applies, Alice encodes herinformation in nonorthogonal states we shall illustratethis in the sections II C and IID. Second, as we havepresented it so far, Alice and Bob could discover anyeavesdropper, but only after they exchanged their message. It would of course be much better to ensure theprivacy in advance, and not afterwards To achieve this,Alice and Bob complement the above simple idea with asecond idea, again a very simple one, and one which isentirely classical. Alice and Bob do not use the quantumchannel to transmit information, but only to transmit arandom sequence of bits, i.e. a key. Now, if the key isunperturbed, then Quantum Physics guarantees that noone got any information about this key by eavesdroppingi.e. measuring the quantum communication channel.In this case, Alice and Bob can safely use this key toencode messages. If, on the contrary, the key turns outto be perturbed, then Alice and Bob simply disregard itsince the key does not contain any information, they didnot lose any.Let us make this general idea somewhat more precise, anticipating section II C. In practice, the individualquanta used by Alice and Bob, often called qubits forquantum bits, are encoded in individual photons. Forexample, vertical and horizontal polarization code for bitvalue zero and one, respectively. The second basis, canthen be the diagonal one 45o linear polarization, with45o for bit 1 and 45o for bit 0, respectively see Fig.1. Alternatively, the circular polarization basis couldbe used as second basis. For photons the quantum communication channel can either be free space see sectionIVE or optical fibers  special fibers or the ones used instandard telecommunication  section III B. The communication channel is thus not really quantum. What isquantum are the information carriers.But before continuing, we need to see how QC couldfit in the existing cryptosystems. For this purpose thenext section briefly surveys some of the main aspects ofmodern cryptology.B. Classical cryptographyCryptography is the art of rendering a message unintelligible to any unauthorized party. It is part of thebroader field of cryptology, which also includes cryptoanalysis, the art of code breaking for a historical perspective, see Singh 1999. To achieve this goal, an algorithm also called a cryptosystem or cipher is used tocombine a message with some additional information known as the key  and produce a cryptogram. Thistechnique is known as encryption. For a cryptosystemto be secure, it should be impossible to unlock the cryptogram without the key. In practice, this demand is oftensoftened so that the system is just extremely difficult tocrack. The idea is that the message should remain protected at least as long as the information it contains isvaluable. Although confidentiality is the traditional application of cryptography, it is used nowadays to achievebroader objectives, such as authentication, digital signatures and nonrepudiation Brassard 1988.1. Asymmetrical publickey cryptosystemsCryptosytems come in two main classes  depending onwhether Alice and Bob use the same key. Asymmetrical3systems involve the use of different keys for encryptionand decryption. They are commonly known as publickeycryptosystems. Their principle was first proposed in 1976by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who were thenat Stanford University in the US. The first actual implementation was then developed by Ronald Rivest, AdiShamir,and Leonard Adleman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 19784. It is known as RSA and isstill widely used. If Bob wants to be able to receive messages encrypted with a public key cryptosystem, he mustfirst choose a private key, which he keeps secret. Then,he computes from this private key a public key, whichhe discloses to any interested party. Alice uses this publickey to encrypt her message. She transmits the encryptedmessage to Bob, who decrypts it with the private key.Publickey cryptosystems are convenient and they havethus become very popular over the last 20 years. Thesecurity of the internet, for example, is partially basedon such systems. They can be thought of as a mailbox,where anybody can insert a letter. Only the legitimateowner can then recover it, by opening it with his privatekey.The security of public key cryptosystems is based oncomputational complexity. The idea is to use mathematical objects called oneway functions. By definition, itis easy to compute the function fx given the variablex, but difficult to reverse the calculation and compute xfrom fx. In the context of computational complexity,the word difficult means that the time to do a taskgrows exponentially with the number of bits in the input, while easy means that it grows polynomially. Intuitively, it is easy to understand that it only takes a fewseconds to work out 67  71, but it takes much longerto find the prime factors of 4757. However, factoring hasa trapdoor, which means that it is easy to do the calculation in the difficult direction provided that you havesome additional information. For example, if you weretold that 67 was one of the prime factors of 4757, thecalculation would be relatively simple. The security ofRSA is actually based on the factorization of large integers.In spite of its elegance suffers from a major flaw.Whether factoring is difficult or not could never beproven. This implies that the existence of a fast algorithm for factorization cannot be ruled out. In addition, the discovery in 1994 by Peter Shor of a polynomialalgorithm allowing fast factorization of integers with aquantum computer puts additional doubts on the nonexistence of a polynomial algorithm for classical comput4According to the British Government, public key cryptography was originally invented at the Government Communications Headquarters in Cheltenham as early as in 1973. For anhistorical account, see for example the book by Simon Singh1999.ers.Similarly, all publickey cryptosystems rely on unproven assumptions for their security, which could themselves be weakened or suppressed by theoretical or practical advances. So far, no one has proved the existence ofany oneway function with a trapdoor. In other words,the existence of secure asymmetric cryptosystems is notproven. This casts an intolerable threat on these cryptosystems.In a society where information and secure communication is of utmost importance, as in ours, one cannottolerate such a threat. Think, for instance, that anovernight breakthrough in mathematics could make electronic money instantaneously worthless. To limit sucheconomical and social risks, there is no possibility butto turn to symmetrical cryptosystems. QC has a role toplay in such alternative systems.2. Symmetrical secretkey cryptosystemsSymmetrical ciphers require the use of a single key forboth encryption and decryption. These systems can bethought of as a safe, where the message is locked by Alice with a key. Bob in turns uses a copy of this key tounlock the safe. The onetime pad, first proposed byGilbert Vernam of ATT in 1926, belongs to this category. In this scheme, Alice encrypts her message, a stringof bits denoted by the binary number m1, using a randomly generated key k. She simply adds each bit of themessage with the corresponding bit of the key to obtainthe scrambled text s  m1  k, where  denotes thebinary addition modulo 2 without carry. It is then sentto Bob, who decrypts the message by subtracting the keysk  m1kk  m1. Because the bits of the scrambled text are as random as those of the key, they do notcontain any information. This cryptosystem is thus provably secure in the sense of information theory Shannon1949. Actually, this is today the only provably securecryptosystemAlthough perfectly secure, the problem with this system is that it is essential for Alice and Bob to possess acommon secret key, which must be at least as long as themessage itself. They can only use the key for a single encryption  hence the name onetime pad. If they usedthe key more than once, Eve could record all of the scrambled messages and start to build up a picture of the plaintexts and thus also of the key. If Eve recorded two different messages encrypted with the same key, she could addthe scrambled text to obtain the sum of the plain textss1s2  m1km2k  m1m2kk  m1m2,where we used the fact that  is commutative. Furthermore, the key has to be transmitted by some trustedmeans, such as a courier, or through a personal meetingbetween Alice and Bob. This procedure can be complexand expensive, and may even amount to a loophole inthe system.4Because of the problem of distributing long sequencesof key bits, the onetime pad is currently used only for themost critical applications. The symmetrical cryptosystems in use for routine applications such as ecommerceemploy rather short keys. In the case of the Data Encryption Standard also known as DES, promoted by theUnited States National Institute of Standards and Technology, a 56 bits key is combined with the plain textdivided in blocks in a rather complicated way, involvingpermutations and nonlinear functions to produce the cipher text blocks see Stallings 1999 for a didactic presentation. Other cryptosystems e.g. IDEA or AESfollow similar principles. Like asymmetrical cryptosystems, they offer only computational security. Howeverfor a given key length, symmetrical systems are more secure than their asymmetrical counterparts.In practical implementations, asymmetrical algorithmsare not so much used for encryption, because of theirslowness, but to distribute session keys for symmetricalcryptosystems such as DES. Because the security of thosealgorithms is not proven see paragraph II B 1, the security of the whole implementation can be compromised. Ifthey were broken by mathematical advances, QC wouldconstitute the only way to solve the key distributionproblem.3. The onetimepad as classical teleportationThe onetimepad has an interesting characteristic.Assume that Alice aims at transferring to Bob a faithfulcopy of a classical system, without giving any information to Eve about this system. For this purpose Aliceand Bob have only access to an insecure classical channel. This is possible provided they share an arbitrarylong secret key. Indeed, in principle Alice can measurethe state of her classical system with arbitrary high precision and then use the onetimepad to securely communicate this information to Bob who can then, in principle,reconstruct a copy of the classical system. This somewhat artificial use of the onetimepad has an interestingquantum relative, see section II E.C. The example of the BB84 protocol1. PrincipleThe first protocol for QC has been proposed in 1984by Charles H. Bennett, from IBM NewYork, and GillesBrassard, from the University of Montreal, hence thename BB84 under which this protocol is recognized nowadays. They published their work in a conference in India, totally unknown to physicists. This underlines atonce that QC needs the collaboration between differentcommunities, with different jargons and different habitsand conventions5. The interdisciplinary character of QCis the probable reason for its relatively slow start, butit certainly contributes crucially to the vast and fast expansion over the recent years.We shall explain the BB84 protocol using the languageof spin 12 , but clearly any 2level quantum system woulddo. The protocol uses 4 quantum states that constitute2 bases, think of the states up  , down  , left  and right  . The bases are maximally conjugate inthe sense that any pair of vectors, one from each basis,has the same overlap, e.g.   2  12 . Conventionally, one attributes the binary value 0 to states   and  and the value 1 to the other two states, and callsthe states qubits for quantum bits. In the first step,Alice sends individual spins to Bob in states chosen atrandom among the 4 basic states in Fig. 1 the spinstates  , ,   and   are identified with thepolarization states horizontal, verical, 45o and45o, respectively. How she chooses at random isa delicate problem in practice see section III D, but inprinciple she could use her free will. The individual spinscould be sent all at once, or one after the other muchmore practical the only restriction being that Alice andBob can establish a onetoone correspondence betweenthe transmitted and the received spins. Next, Bob measures the incoming spins in one of the two bases, chosenat random using a random number generator independent from that of Alice. At this point, whenever theyused the same basis, they get perfectly correlated results.However, whenever they used different basis, they getuncorrelated results. Hence, on average, Bob obtains astring of bits with 25 errors, called the raw key. This error rate is so large that standard error correction schemeswould fail. But in this protocol, as we shall see, Alice andBob know which bits are perfectly correlated the ones forwhich Alice and Bob used the same basis and which onesare completely uncorrelated all the other ones. Hence,a straightforward error correction scheme is possible Foreach bit Bob announces publicly in which basis he measured the corresponding qubit but he does not tell theresult he obtained. Alice then only tells whether or notthe state in which she encoded that qubit is compatiblewith the basis announced by Bob. If the state is compatible, they keep the bit, if not they disregard it. Inthis way about 50 of the bit string is discarded. Thisshorter key obtained after bases reconciliation is calledthe sifted key6. The fact that Alice and Bob use a publicchannel at some stage of their protocol is very common5For instance, it is amusing to note that physicists mustpublish in reputed journals while conference proceedings areof secondary importance. For computer science, on the contrary, the proceedings of the best conferences are consideredas the top, while journals are secondary6This terminology has been introduced by Ekert and Huttner in 1994.5in cryptoprotocols. This channel does not have to beconfidential, but has to be authentic. Hence, any adversary Eve can listen to all the communication on thepublic channel, but she cant modify it. In practice Alice and Bob may use the same transmission channel toimplement both the quantum and the classical channels.Note that neither Alice nor Bob can decide which keyresults from the protocol7. Indeed, it is the conjunctionof both of their random choices which produces the key.Let us now consider the security of the above idealprotocol ideal because so far we did not take into account unavoidable noise due to technical imperfections.Assume that some adversary Eve intercepts a qubit propagating from Alice to Bob. This is very easy, but if Bobdoes not receive an expected qubit, he will simply informAlice to disregard it. Hence, in this way Eve only lowersthe bit rate possibly down to zero, but she does notgain any useful information. For real eavesdropping Evemust send a qubit to Bob. Ideally she would like to sendthis qubit in its original state, keeping a copy for herself.2. No cloning theoremFollowingWootters and Zurek 1982 it is easy to provethat perfect copying is impossible in the quantum worldsee also Milonni and Hardies 1982, Dieks 1982, and theanticipating intuition by Wigner in 1961. Let  denotethe original state of the qubit, b the blank copy8 anddenote 0  HQCM the initial state of Eves quantumcopy machine, where the Hilbert space HQCM of thequantum cloning machine is arbitrary. The ideal machinewould produce  b  0      f 3where f denotes the final state of Eves machine whichmight depend on . Accordingly, using obvious notations, , b, 0   , , f 4and  , b, 0   , , f. 5By linearity of quantum dynamics it follows that , b, 0  12    b, 0 6 12 , , f  , , f. 77Alice and Bob can however determine the statistics of thekey.8b corresponds to the stock of white paper in everydaysphotocopy machine. We shall assume that exceptionally thisstock is not empty, a purely theoretical assumption, as is wellknown.But the latter state differs from the ideal copy  ,, f, whatever the states f are.Consequently, Eve cant keep a perfect quantum copy,because perfect quantum copy machines cant exist. Thepossibility to copy classical information is probably oneof the most characteristic features of information in theevery day sense. The fact that quantum states, nowadaysoften called quantum information, cant be copied is certainly one of the most specific attributes which make thisnew kind of information so different, hence so attractive.Actually, this negative rule has clearly its positive side,since it prevents Eve from perfect eavesdropping, andhence makes QC potentially secure.3. Interceptresend strategyWe have seen that the eavesdropper needs to send aqubit to Bob, while keeping a necessarily imperfect copyfor herself. How imperfect the copy has to be, according to quantum theory, is a delicate problem that weshall address in chapter VI. Here, let us develop a simple eavesdropping strategy, called interceptresend. Thissimple and even practical attack consists in Eve measuring each qubit in one of the two basis, precisely as Bobdoes. Then, she resends to Bob another qubit in thestate corresponding to her measurement result. In abouthalf of the cases Eve will be lucky and choose the basiscompatible with the state prepared by Alice. In thesecases she resends to Bob a qubit in the correct state andAlice and Bob wont notice her intervention. However, inthe other 50 cases, Eve unluckily uses the basis incompatible with the state prepared by Alice. This necessarilyhappens, since Eve has no information on Alices randomgenerator hence the importance that this generator istruly random. In these cases the qubits sent out by Eveare in states with overlap 12 with the correct states. Alice and Bob discover thus her intervention in about halfof these cases, since they get uncorrelated results. Altogether, if Eve uses this interceptresend strategy, she gets50 information, while Alice and Bob have about 25of errors in their sifted key, i.e. after they eliminated thecases in which they used incompatible states, there arestill about 25 errors. They can thus easily detect thepresence of Eve. If, however, Eve applies this strategy toonly a fraction of the communication, 10 lets say, thenthe error rate will be only 2.5 while Eves informationwould be 5. The next section explains how Alice andBob can counter such attacks.4. Error correction, privacy amplification and quantumsecret growingAt this point in the BB84 protocol, Alice and Bobshare a socalled sifted key. But this key contains errors.The errors are caused as well by technical imperfections,6as possibly by Eves intervention. Realistic error rateson the sifted key using todays technology are of a fewpercent. This contrasts strongly with the 109 typical inoptical communication. Of course, the few percent errorswill be corrected down to the standard 109 during theclassical error correction step of the protocol. In orderto avoid confusion, especially among the optical communication specialists, Beat Perny from Swisscom and PaulTownsend, then with BT, proposed to name the errorrate on the sifted key QBER, for Quantum Bit ErrorRate, to make it clearly distinct from the BER used instandard communications.Such a situation where the legitimate partners shareclassical information, with high but not 100 correlation and with possibly some correlation to a third partyis common to all quantum cryptosystems. Actually, itis also a standard starting point for classical informationbased cryptosystems where one assumes that somehowAlice, Bob and Eve have random variables ,  and , respectively, with joint probability distribution P , , .Consequently, the last step in a QC protocol uses classical algorithms, first to correct the errors, next to lowerEves information on the final key, a process called privacy amplification.The first mention of privacy amplification appears inBennett, Brassard and Robert 1988. It was then extended in collaboration with C. Crepeau and U. Maurerfrom the University of Montreal and the ETH Zurich, respectively Bennett et al. 1995, see also Bennett et al.1992a. Interestingly, this work motivated by QC foundapplications in standard informationbased cryptographyMaurer 1993, Maurer and Wolf 1999.Assume that such a joint probability distributionP , ,  exists. Near the end of this section, we comment on this assumption. Alice and Bob have access onlyto the marginal distribution P , . From this and fromthe laws of quantum mechanics, they have to deduce constraints on the complete scenario P , , , in particularthey have to bound Eves information see sections VIEand VIG. Given P , , , necessary and sufficient conditions for a positive secret key rate between Alice andBob, S, , are not yet known. However, a usefullower bound is given by the difference between Alice andBobs mutual Shannon information I,  and Eves mutual information Csiszar and Korner 1978, and theorem1 in section VIGS,   maxI,   I, , I,   I, 8Intuitively, this result states that secure key distillationBennett et al. 1992a is possible whenever Bob has moreinformation than Eve.The bound 8 is tight if Alice and Bob are restrictedto oneway communication, but for twoway communication, secret key agreement might be possible even when8 is not satisfied see next paragraph II C5.Without discussing any algorithm in detail, let us givesome intuition how Alice and Bob can establish a secret key when condition 8 is satisfied. First, once thesifted key is obtained i.e. after the bases have been announced, Alice and Bob publicly compare a randomlychosen subset of it. In this way they estimate the errorrate more generally, they estimate their marginal probability distribution P , . These publicly disclosedbits are then discarded. Next, either condition 8 is notsatisfied and they stop the protocol. Or condition 8is satisfied and they use some standard error correctionprotocol to get a shorter key without errors.With the simplest error correction protocol, Alice randomly chooses pairs of bits and announces their XORvalue i.e. their sum modulo 2. Bob replies either accept if he has the same XOR value for his correspondingbits, or reject if not. In the first case, Alice and Bobkeep the first bit of the pair and eliminate the second one,while in the second case they eliminate both bits. In reality, more complex and efficient algorithms are used.After error correction, Alice and Bob have identicalcopies of a key, but Eve may still have some informationabout it compatible with condition 8. Alice and Bobthus need to lower Eves information down to an arbitrarily low value using some privacy amplification protocols.These classical protocols typically work as follows. Aliceagain randomly choses pairs of bits and computes theirXOR value. But, contrary to error correction she doesnot announce this XOR value. She only announces whichbits she chose e.g. bit number 103 and 537. Alice andBob then replace the two bits by their XOR value. Inthis way they shorten their key while keeping it errorfree, but if Eve has only partial information on the twobits, her information on the XOR value is even lower.Consider for example that Eve knows only the value ofthe first bit, and nothing about the second one. Thenshe has no information at all on the XOR value. Also, ifEve knows the value of both bits with 60 probability,then the probability that she guesses correctly the valueof the XOR is only of 0.62  0.42  52. This processwould have to be repeated several times more efficientalgorithms use larger blocks Brassard and Salvail 1993.The error correction and privacy amplification algorithms sketched above are purely classical algorithms.This illustrates that QC is a truly interdisciplinary field.Actually, the above presentation is incomplete. Indeed,in this presentation, we have assumed that Eve has measured her probe before Alice and Bob run the error correction and privacy amplification algorithms, hence thatP , ,  exists. In practice this is a very reasonableassumption, but, in principle, Eve could wait until theend of all the protocol, and then optimize her measurements accordingly. Such delayed choice eavesdropping7strategies9 are discussed in chapter VI.It should now be clear that QC does not provide acomplete solution for all cryptographic purposes10. Actually, quite on the contrary, QC can only be used asa complement to standard symmetrical cryptosystems.Accordingly, a more precise name for QC is QuantumKey Distribution, since this is all QC does. Nevertheless,we prefer to keep the well known terminology which givesits title to this review.Finally, let us emphasize that every key distributionsystem must incorporate some authentification schemethe two parties must identify themselves. If not, Alicecould actually be communicating directly with Eve Astraightforward possibility is that Alice and Bob initiallyshare a short secret. Then QC provides them with alonger one and, for example, they each keep a small portion for authentification at the next session Bennett etal. 1992a. From this perspective, QC is a QuantumSecret Growing protocol.5. Advantage distillationQC has triggered and still triggers research in classicalinformation theory. The best known example is probably the development of privacy amplification algorithmsBennett et al. 1988 and 1995. This in turn triggeredthe development of new cryptosystems based on weak butclassical signals, emitted for instance by satellites Maurer 199311. These new developments required secret keyagreement protocols that can be used even when the condition 8 doesnt apply. Such protocols, called advantagedistillation, necessarily use two way communication andare much less efficient than privacy amplification. Usually, they are not considered in the literature on QC.But, conceptually, they are remarkable from at least twopoints of view. First it is somewhat surprising that secret key agreement is possible even if Alice and Bob startwith less mutual Shannon information than Eve. However, they can take advantage of the authenticated publicchannel Alice and Bob can decide which series of realiza9Note however that Eve has to choose the interaction between her probe and the qubits before the public discussionphase of the protocol.10For a while it was thought that bit commitment see, e.g.,Brassard 1988, a powerful primitive in cryptology, could berealized using quantum principles. However, Dominic Mayers1996a and 1997 and Lo and Chau 1998 proved it to beimpossible see also Brassard et al. 1998.11Note that here the confidentiality is not guaranteed bythe laws of physics, but relies on the assumption that Evestechnology is limited, e.g. her antenna is finite, her detectorshave limited efficiencies.tion to keep, whereas Eve cant influence this process12Maurer 1993, Maurer and Wolf 1999.Recently a second remarkable connection betweenquantum and classical secret key agreement has been discovered assuming they use the Ekert protocol describedin paragraph IID 3 If Eve follows the strategy which optimizes her Shannon information, under the assumptionthat she attacks the qubit one at a time the socalledindividual attacks, see section VIE, then Alice and Bobcan use advantage distillation if and only if Alice andBobs qubits are still entangled they can thus use quantum privacy amplification Deutsch et al. 1996 Gisinand Wolf 1999. This connection between the conceptof entanglement, central to quantum information theory,and the concept of intrinsic classical information, central to classical information based cryptography Maurerand Wolf 1999, has been shown to be general Gisinand Wolf 2000. The connection seems even to extend tobound entanglement Gisin et al. 2000.D. Other protocols1. 2state protocolIn 1992 Charles H. Bennett noticed that actually 4states is more than necessary for QC all what is reallyneeded is 2 nonorthogonal states. Indeed the security relies on the impossibility for any adversary to distinguishunambiguously and without perturbation between thedifferent states that Alice may send to Bob, hence 2 statesare necessary and if they are incompatible i.e. not mutually orthogonal, then 2 states are also sufficient. This isa conceptually important clarification. It also made several of the first experimental demonstrations easier thisis further discussed in section IVD. But in practice itis not a good solution. Indeed, although 2 nonorthogonal states cant be distinguished unambiguously withoutperturbation, one can unambiguously distinguish themat the cost of some losses Ivanovic 1987, Peres 1988.This possibility has even been demonstrated in practiceHuttner et al. 1996, Clarke et al. 2000. Hence, Aliceand Bob would have to monitor the attenuation of the12The idea is that Alice picks out several instances where shegot the same bit and communicates the instances  but notthe bit  to Bob. Bob replies yes only if it happens that for allthese instances he also has the same bit value. For large errorrates this is unlikely, but when it happens there is a largechance that both have the same bit. Eve cant influence thechoice of the instances. All she can do is to use a majorityvote for the cases accepted by Bob. The probability that Evemakes an error can be much larger than the probability thatBob makes an error i.e. that all his instances are wrong,even if Eves initial information is larger than Bobs.8quantum channel and even this is not entirely safe if Evecould replace the channel by a more transparent one, seesection VIH. The twostate protocol can also be implemented using an interference between a macroscopicbright pulse and a dim pulse with less than one photon onaverage Bennett, 1992. The presence of the bright pulsemakes this protocol specially resistant to eavesdropping,even in settings with high attenuation. Indeed Bob canmonitor the bright pulses, to make sure that Eve does notremove any. In this case, Eve cannot eliminate the dimpulse without revealing her presence, because the interference of the bright pulse with vacuum would introduceerrors. A practical implementation of this protocol isdiscussed in section IVD. Huttner et al. extended thisreference beam monitoring to the fourstates protocol in1995.2. 6state protocolWhile two states are enough and four states are standard, a 6state protocol respects much more the symmetry of the qubit state space, see Fig. 2 Bruss 1998,BechmannPasquinucci and Gisin 1999. The 6 statesconstitute 3 bases, hence the probability that Alice andBob chose the same basis is only of 13 . But the symmetry of this protocol greatly simplifies the security analysis and reduces Eves optimal information gain for agiven error rate QBER. If Eve measures every photon,the QBER is 33, compared to 25 in the case of theBB84 protocol.3. EPR protocolThis variation of the BB84 protocol is of special conceptual, historical and practical interest. The idea is dueto Artur Ekert 1991 from Oxford University, who, whileelaborating on a suggestion of David Deutsch 1985, discovered QC independently of the BB84 paper. Intellectually, it is very satisfactory to see this direct connection to the famous EPR paradox Einstein, Podolski andRosen 1935 the initially philosophical debate turned totheoretical physics with Bells inequality 1964, then toexperimental physics Freedmann and Clauser 1972, Fryand Thompson 1976, and Aspect, Dalibard and Roger1982, and is now  thanks to Ekerts ingenious idea part of applied physics.The idea consists in replacing the quantum channelcarrying qubits from Alice to Bob by a channel carrying2 qubits from a common source, one qubit to Alice andone to Bob. A first possibility would be that the sourceemits the two qubits always in the same state chosen randomly among the 4 states of the BB84 protocol. Aliceand Bob would then both measure their qubit in one ofthe two bases, again chosen independently and randomly.The source then announces the bases and Alice and Bobkeep the data only when they happen to have done theirmeasurements in the compatible basis. If the source isreliable, this protocol is equivalent to the BB84 one Every thing is as if the qubit propagates backwards in timefrom Alice to the source, and then forwards to Bob Butbetter than trusting the source, which could be in Eveshand, the Ekert protocol assumes that the 2 qubits areemitted in a maximally entangled state like 12 ,   , . 9Then, when Alice and Bob happen to use the same basis,both the xbasis or both the ybasis, i.e. in about halfof the cases, their results are identical, providing themwith a common key. Note the similarity between the 1qubit BB84 protocol illustrated in Fig. 1 and the 2qubitEkert protocol of Fig. 3. The analogy can be even madestronger by noting that for all unitary evolutions U1 andU2, the following equality holdU1  U2  1  U2U t1 10where U t1 denotes the transpose.In his 1991 paper Artur Ekert suggested to base thesecurity of this 2qubit protocol on Bells inequality, aninequality which demonstrates that some correlation predicted by quantum mechanics cant be reproduced byany local theory Bell 1964. For this, Alice and Bobhave a third choice of basis see Fig. 4. In this way theprobability that they happen to choose the same basisis reduced from 12 to29 , but at the same time as theyestablish a key they collect enough data to test Bell inequality13. They can thus check that the source reallyemits the entangled state 9 and not merely productstates. The following year Bennett, Brassard and Mermin 1992b criticized Ekerts letter, arguing that theviolation of Bell inequality is not necessary for the security of QC and emphasizing the close connection betweenthe Ekert and the BB84 schemes. This criticism mightbe missing an important point. Indeed, although the exact relation between security and Bell inequality is notyet fully known, there are clear results establishing fascinating connections, see section VIF. In October 1992,an article by Bennett, Brassard and Ekert demonstratedthat the founding fathers joined forces to develop the fieldin a pleasant atmosphere Bennett et al. 1992c13A maximal violation of Bell inequality is necessary to ruleout tampering by Eve. In this case, the QBER must necessarily be equal to zero. With a nonmaximal violation, astypically obtained in experimental systems, Alice and Bobcan distil a secure key using error correction and privacyamplification.94. Other variationsThere is a large collection of variations around theBB84 protocol. Let us mention a few, chosen somewhatarbitrarily. First, one can assume that the two basesare not chosen with equal probability Ardehali et al.1998. This has the nice consequence that the probability that Alice and Bob choose the same basis is largerthan 12 , increasing thus the transmission rate of the siftedkey. However, this protocol makes Eves job easier as sheis more likely to guess correctly the used basis. Consequently, it is not clear whether the final key rate, aftererror correction and privacy amplification, is higher ornot.Another variation consists in using quantum systems ofdimension larger than 2 BechmannPasquinucci and Tittel 2000, BechmannPasquinucci and Peres 2000, Bourennane et al. 2001a. Again, the practical value of this ideahas not yet been fully determined.A third variation worth mentioning is due to Goldenberg and Vaidman, from TelAviv University 1995.They suggested to prepare the qubits in a superpositionof two spatially separated states, then to send one component of this superposition and to wait until Bob receivedit before sending the second component. This doesntsound of great practical value, but has the nice conceptual feature that the minimal two states do not need tobe mutually orthogonal.E. Quantum teleportation as QuantumonetimepadSince its discovery in 1993 by a surprisingly largegroup of physicists, Quantum teleportation Bennett etal. 1993 received a lot of attention in the scientific community as well as in the general public. The dream ofbeaming travellers through the Universe is exciting, butcompletely out of the realm of any foreseeable technology. However, quantum teleportation can be seen as thefully quantum version of the onetimepad, see paragraphII B 3, hence as the ultimate form of QC. Similarly toclassical teleportation, lets assume that Alice aims attransferring to Bob a faithful copy of a quantum system.If Alice has full knowledge of the quantum state, theproblem is not really a quantum one Alice informationis classical. If, on the opposite, Alice does not know thequantum state, she cannot send a copy, since quantumcopying is impossible according to quantum physics seeparagraph IIC 2. Nor can she send classical instructions,since this would allow the production of many copies.However, if Alice and Bob share arbitrarily many entangled qubits, sometimes called a quantum key, and share aclassical communication channel then the quantum teleportation protocol provides them with a mean to transferthe quantum state of the system from Alice to Bob. Inthe course of running this protocol, Alices quantum system is destroyed without Alice learning anything aboutthe quantum state, while Bobs qubit ends in a stateisomorphic to the state of the original system but Bobdoesnt learn anything about the quantum state. If theinitial quantum system is a quantum message coded inthe form of a sequence of qubits, then this quantum message is faithfully and securely transferred to Bob, withoutany information leaking to the outside world i.e. to anyone not sharing the prior entanglement with Alice andBob. Finally, the quantum message could be formed ofa 4 letter quantum alphabet constituted by the 4 statesof the BB84 protocol. With futuristic, but not impossible technology, Alice and Bob could have their entangledqubits in appropriate wallets and could establish a totallysecure communication at any time, without even havingto know where the partner is located provided they cancommunicate classically.F. Optical amplification, quantum nondemolitionmeasurements and optimal quantum cloningAfter almost every general talk on QC, two questionsarise what about optical amplifiers and what aboutquantum nondemolition measurements In this sectionwe briefly address these questions.Let us start with the second one, being the easiest. Theterminology quantum nondemolition measurement issimply a confusing one There is nothing like a quantum measurement that does not perturb i.e. modifythe quantum state, except if the state happens to be aneigenstate of the observable. Hence, if for some reasonone conjectures that a quantum system is in some stateor in a state among a set of mutually orthogonal ones,this can be in principle tested repeatedly Braginsky andKhalili 1992. But if the state is only restricted to be ina finite set containing nonorthogonal states, as in QC,then there is no way to perform a measurement withoutdemolishing perturbing the state. Now, in QC theterminology nondemolition measurement is also usedwith a different meaning one measures the number ofphotons in a pulse without affecting the degree of freedom coding the qubit e.g. the polarization, see sectionVIH, or one detects the presence of a photon withoutdestroying it Nogues et al. 1999. Such measurementsare usually called ideal measurements, or projectivemeasurements, because they produce the least possibleperturbation Piron 1990 and because they can be represented by projectors. It is important to stress that theseideal measurements do not invalidate the security ofQC.Let us consider now optical amplifiers a laser medium,but without mirrors, so that amplification takes place ina single pass, see Desurvire 1994. They are widely usedin todays optical communication networks. However,they are of no use for quantum communication. Indeed,as seen in section II C, the copying of quantum information is impossible. Here we illustrate this characteristic10of quantum information with the example of optical amplifiers the necessary presence of spontaneous emissionwhenever there is stimulated emission, prevents perfectcopying. Let us clarify this important and often confusing point, following the work of Simon et al. 1999 and2000 see also Kempe et al. 2000, and De Martini et al.2000. Let the two basic qubit states 0 and 1 be physically implemented by two optical modes 0  1, 0 and1  0, 1. n,mph  k, la denotes thus the state ofn photons in mode 1 and m in mode 2, and k, l  0 1the ground excited state of 2level atoms coupled tomode 1 and 2, respectively. Hence spontaneous emissioncorresponds to0, 0ph  1, 0a  1, 0ph  0, 0a, 110, 0ph  0, 1a  0, 1ph  0, 0a 12and stimulated emission to1, 0ph  1, 0a 22, 0ph  0, 0a, 130, 1ph  0, 1a 20, 2ph  0, 0a 14where the2 factor takes into account the ratio stimulatedspontaneous emission. Let the initial state of theatom be a mixture of the following two states each withequal weight 500, 1a 1, 0a 15By symmetry, it suffices to consider one possible initialstate of the qubit, e.g. 1 photon in the first mode 1, 0ph.The initial state of the photonatom system is thus amixture1, 0ph  1, 0a or 1, 0ph  0, 1a 16This corresponds to the first order term in an evolutionwith a Hamiltonian in the interaction picture H a11  a11  a22  a22. After some time the2photon component of the evolved states reads22, 0ph  0, 0a or 1, 1ph  0, 0a 17The correspondence with a pair of spin 12 goes as follows2, 0    0, 2    181, 1ph   12    19Tracing over the amplifier i.e. the 2level atom, anideal amplifier achieves the following transformationP  2P  P 20where the P s indicate projectors i.e. pure state densitymatrices and the lack of normalization results from thefirst order expansion used in 11 to 14. Accordingly,after normalization, each photon is in state Tr1ph mode2P  P32P 121321The corresponding fidelity isF 2  1235622which is precisely the optimal fidelity compatible withquantum mechanics Buzek and Hillery 1996, Bruss etal 1998, Gisin and Massar 1997. In other words, if westart with a single photon in an arbitrary state, and passit through an amplifier, then due to the effect of spontaneous emission the fidelity of the state exiting the amplifier, in the cases where it consists of exactly two photons,with the initial state will be equal to at most 56. Notethat if it were possible to make better copies, then, usingEPR correlations between spatially separated systems,signaling at arbitrarily fast speed would also be possibleGisin 1998.11III. TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGESThe very first demonstration of QC was a table top experiment performed at the IBM laboratory in the early1990s over a distance of 30 cm Bennett et al. 1992a,marking the start of impressive experimental improvements during the last years. The 30 cm distance is oflittle practical interest. Either the distance should beeven shorter, think of a credit card and the ATM machine Huttner et al. 1996b, but in this case all of Alices components should fit on the credit card. A niceidea, but still impractical with present technology. Orthe distance should be much longer, at least in the kmrange. Most of the research so far uses optical fibers toguide the photons from Alice to Bob and we shall mainlyconcentrate here on such systems. There is, however, alsosome very significant research on free space systems, seesection IVE.Once the medium is chosen, there remain the questionsof the source and detectors. Since they have to be compatible, the crucial choice is the wavelength. There aretwo main possibilities. Either one chooses a wavelengtharound 800 nm where efficient photon counters are commercially available, or one chooses a wavelength compatible with todays telecommunication optical fibers, i.e.near 1300 nm or 1550 nm. The first choice requires freespace transmission or the use of special fibers, hence theinstalled telecommunication networks cant be used. Thesecond choice requires the improvement or developmentof new detectors, not based on silicon semiconductors,which are transparent above 1000 nm wavelength.In case of transmission using optical fibers, it is stillunclear which of the two alternatives will turn out to bethe best choice. If QC finds niche markets, it is conceivable that special fibers will be installed for that purpose.But it is equally conceivable that new commercial detectors will soon make it much easier to detect single photons at telecommunication wavelengths. Actually, thelatter possibility is very likely, as several research groupsand industries are already working on it. There is another good reason to bet on this solution the qualityof telecommunication fibers is much higher than that ofany special fiber, in particular the attenuation is muchlower this is why the telecommunication industry chosethese wavelengths at 800 nm, the attenuation is about2 dBkm i.e. half the photons are lost after 1.5 km,while it is only of the order of 0.35 and 0.20 dBkm at1300 nm and 1550 nm, respectively 50 loss after about9 and 15 km 14.In case of free space transmission, the choice of wavelength is straightforward since the region where goodphoton detectors exist  around 800 nm  coincides with14 The losses in dB ldb can be calculated from the losses inpercent l ldB  10 log101l100.the one where absorption is low. However, free spacetransmission is restricted to lineof sight links and is veryweather dependent.In the next sections we successively consider the questions how to produce single photons section III A,how to transmit them section III B, how to detectsingle photons section III C, and finally how to exploit the intrinsic randomness of quantum processes tobuild random generators section III D.A. Photon sourcesOptical quantum cryptography is based on the use ofsingle photon Fock states. Unfortunately, these statesare difficult to realize experimentally. Nowadays, practical implementations rely on faint laser pulses or entangled photon pairs, where both the photon as well as thephotonpair number distribution obeys Poisson statistics.Hence, both possibilities suffer from a small probabilityof generating more than one photon or photon pair atthe same time. For large losses in the quantum channel even small fractions of these multiphotons can haveimportant consequences on the security of the key seesection VIH, leading to interest in photon guns, seeparagraph III A 3. In this section we briefly commenton sources based on faint pulses as well as on entangled photonpairs, and we compare their advantages anddrawbacks.1. Faint laser pulsesThere is a very simple solution to approximate singlephoton Fock states coherent states with an ultralowmean photon number . They can easily be realized using only standard semiconductor lasers and calibratedattenuators. The probability to find n photons in such acoherent state follows the Poisson statisticsP n,  nne. 23Accordingly, the probability that a nonempty weak coherent pulse contains more than 1 photon,P n  1n  0,   1 P 0,  P 1, 1 P 0, 1 e1  1 e 224can be made arbitrarily small. Weak pulses are thus extremely practical and have indeed been used in the vastmajority of experiments. However, they have one major drawback. When  is small, most pulses are emptyP n  0  1 . In principle, the resulting decrease inbit rate could be compensated for thanks to the achievable GHz modulation rates of telecommunication lasers.12But in practice the problem comes from the detectorsdark counts i.e. a click without a photon arriving.Indeed, the detectors must be active for all pulses, including the empty ones. Hence the total dark countsincrease with the lasers modulation rate and the ratioof the detected photons over the dark counts i.e. thesignal to noise ratio decreases with  see section IVA.The problem is especially severe for longer wavelengthswhere photon detectors based on Indium Gallium Arsenide semiconductors InGaAs are needed see sectionIII C since the noise of these detectors explodes if theyare opened too frequently in practice with a rate largerthan a few MHz. This prevents the use of really lowphoton numbers, smaller than approximately 1. Mostexperiments to date relied on   0.1, meaning that 5of the nonempty pulses contain more than one photon.However, it is important to stress that, as pointed outby Lutkenhaus 2000, there is an optimal  dependingon the transmission losses 15. After key distillation, thesecurity is just as good with faint laser pulses as withFock states. The price to pay for using such states lies ina reduction of the bit rate.2. Photon pairs generated by parametric downconversionAnother way to create pseudo singlephoton states isthe generation of photon pairs and the use of one photonas a trigger for the other one Hong and Mandel 1986.In contrast to the sources discussed before, the seconddetector must be activated only whenever the first onedetected a photon, hence when   1, and not whenevera pump pulse has been emitted, therefore circumventingthe problem of empty pulses.The photon pairs are generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion in a 2 nonlinear crystal16. Inthis process, the inverse of the wellknown frequency doubling, one photon spontaneously splits into two daughterphotons  traditionally called signal and idler photon conserving total energy and momentum. In this context, momentum conservation is called phase matching,and can be achieved despite chromatic dispersion by exploiting the birefringence of the nonlinear crystal. Thephase matching allows to choose the wavelength, and determines the bandwidth of the downconverted photons.15Contrary to a frequent misconception, there is nothing special about a  value of 0.1, eventhough it has been selectedby most experimentalists. The optimal value  i.e. the valuethat yields the highest key exchange rate after distillation depends on the optical losses in the channel and on assumptions about Eves technology see VIH and VI I.16 For a review see Rarity and Tapster 1988, and for latestdevelopments Tittel et al. 1999, Kwiat et al. 1999, Jenneweinet al. 2000b, Tanzilli et al. 2001.The latter is in general rather large and varies from a fewnanometers up to some tens of nanometers. For the nondegenerate case one typically gets 510 nm, whereas inthe degenerate case central frequency of both photonsequal the bandwidth can be as large as 70 nm.This photon pair creation process is very inefficient,typically it needs some 1010 pump photons to create onepair in a given mode17. The number of photon pairs permode is thermally distributed within the coherence timeof the photons, and follows a poissonian distribution forlarger time windows Walls and Milburn 1995. With apump power of 1 mW, about 106 pairs per second canbe collected in single mode fibers. Accordingly, in a timewindow of roughly 1ns the conditional probability to finda second pair having detected one is 106  109  0.1.In case of continuous pumping, this time window is givenby the detector resolution. Tolerating, e.g. 1 of thesemultipair events, one can generate 107 pairs per second,using a realistic 10 mW pump. Detecting for example10  of the trigger photons, the second detector has tobe activated 106 times per second. In comparison, theexample of 1 of multiphoton events corresponds in thecase of faint laser pulses to a mean photon number of  0.02. In order to get the same number 106 of nonemptypulses per second, a pulse rate of 50 MHz is needed. For agiven photon statistics, photon pairs allow thus to workwith lower pulse rates e.g. 50 times lower and hencereduced detectorinduced errors. However, due to limitedcoupling efficiency into optical fibers, the probability tofind the sister photon after detection of the trigger photonin the respective fiber is in practice lower than 1. Thismeans that the effective photon number is not one, butrather   23 Ribordy et al. 2001, still well above  0.02.Photon pairs generated by parametric down conversionoffer a further major advantage if they are not merelyused as pseudo singlephoton source, but if their entanglement is exploited. Entanglement leads to quantumcorrelations which can be used for key generation, seeparagraph II D 3 and chapter V. In this case, if two photon pairs are emitted within the same time window buttheir measurement basis is choosen independently, theyproduce completely uncorrelated results. Hence, depending on the realization, the problem of multiple photon canbe avoided, see section VI J.Figure 5 shows one of our sources creating entangledphoton pairs at 1310 nm wavelength as used in tests ofBell inequalities over 10 kilometers Tittel et al. 1998.Although not as simple as faint laser sources, diodepumped photon pair sources emitting in the near infraredcan be made compact, robust and rather handy.17Recently we achieved a conversion rate of 106 using anoptical waveguide in a periodically poled LiNbO3 crystalTanzilli et al. 2001.133. Photon gunsThe ideal single photon source is a device that whenone pulls the trigger, and only then, emits one and onlyone photon. Hence the name photon gun. Although photon antibunching has been demonstrated already yearsago Kimble et al. 1977, a practical and handy device isstill awaited. At present, there are essentially three different experimental approaches that come more or lessclose to this ideal.A first idea is to work with a single twolevel quantum system that can obviously not emit two photons ata time. The manipulation of single trapped atoms orions requires a much too involved technical effort. Single organics dye molecules in solvents S.C. Kitson et al.1998 or solids Brunel et al. 1999, Fleury et al. 2000are easier to handle but only offer limited stability atroom temperature. Promising candidates, however, arenitrogenvacancy centers in diamond, a substitutional nitrogen atom with a vacancy trapped at an adjacent lattice position Kurtsiefer et al. 2000, Brouri et al. 2000.It is possible to excite individual nitrogen atoms with a532 nm laser beam, which will subsequently emit a fluorescence photon around 700 nm 12ns decay time. Thefluorescence exhibits strong photon antibunching andthe samples are stable at room temperature. However,the big remaining experimental challenge is to increasethe collection efficiency currently about 0.1 in orderto obtain mean photon numbers close to 1. To obtainthis, an optical cavity or a photonic bandgap structuremust suppress the emission in all spatial modes but one.In addition, the spectral bandwith of this type of sourceis broad of the order of 100 nm, enhancing the effect ofpertubations in a quantum channel.A second approach is to generate photons by singleelectrons in a mesoscopic pn junction. The idea is totake profit of the fact that thermal electrons show antibunching Pauli exclusion principle in contrast to photons Imamoglu and Yamamoto, 1994. First experimental results have been presented Kim et al. 1999, however with extremely low efficiencies, and only at a temperature of 50mKFinally, another approach is to use the photon emission of electronhole pairs in a semiconductor quantumdot. The frequency of the emitted photon depends on thenumber of electronhole pairs present in the dot. Afterone creates several such pairs by optical pumping, theywill sequentially recombine and hence emit photons atdifferent frequencies. Therefore, by spectral filtering asinglephoton pulse can be obtained Gerard et al. 1999,Santori et al. 2000, and Michler et al. 2000. These dotscan be integrated in solidstates microcavities with strongenhancements of the spontaneous emission Gerard et al.1998.In summary, todays photon guns are still too complicated to be used in a QCprototype. Moreover, due totheir low quantum efficiencies they do not offer an advantage with respect to faint laser pulses with extremelylow mean photon numbers .B. Quantum channelsThe single photon source and the detectors must beconnected by a quantum channel. Such a channel isactually nothing specially quantum, except that it is intended to carry information encoded in individual quantum systems. Here individual doesnt mean nondecomposible, it is meant in opposition to ensemble.The idea is that the information is coded in a physicalsystem only once, contrary to classical communicationwhere many photons carry the same information. Notethat the present day limit for fiberbased classical opticalcommunication is already down to a few tens of photons,although in practice one usually uses many more. Withthe increasing bit rate and the limited mean power  imposed to avoid nonlinear effects in silica fibers  thesefigures are likely to get closer and closer to the quantumdomain.The individual quantum systems are usually 2levelsystems, called qubits. During their propagation theymust be protected from environmental noise. Here environment refers to everything outside the degree offreedom used for the encoding, which is not necessarily outside the physical system. If, for example, the information is encoded in the polarization state, then theoptical frequencies of the photon is part of the environment. Hence, coupling between the polarization and theoptical frequency has to be mastered18 e.g. avoid wavelength sensitive polarizers and birefringence. Moreover,the sender of the qubits should avoid any correlation between the polarization and the spectrum of the photons.Another difficulty is that the bases used by Alice tocode the qubits and the bases used by Bob for his measurements must be related by a known and stable unitary transformation. Once this unitary transformationis known, Alice and Bob can compensate for it and getthe expected correlation between their preparations andmeasurements. If it changes with time, they need an active feedback to track it, and if the changes are too fastthe communication must be interrupted.1. Singlemode fibersLight is guided in optical fibers thanks to the refractive index profile nx, y across the section of the fiberstraditionally, the zaxis is along the propagation direction. Over the last 25 years, a lot of effort has been18Note that, as we will see in chapter V, using entangledphotons prevents such information leakage.14made to reduce transmission losses  initially several dBper km , and nowadays, the attenuation is as low as2dBkm at 800nm wavelength, 0.35 dBkm at 1310 nm,and 0.2 dBkm at 1550 nm see Fig. 6. It is amusingto note that the dynamical equation describing opticalpulse propagation in the usual slowly varying envelopeaproximation is identical to the Schrodinger equation,with V x, y  nx, y Snyder 1983. Hence a positivebump in the refractive index corresponds to a potentialwell. The region of the well is called the fiber core. Ifthe core is large, many bound modes exist, corresponding to many guided modes in the fiber. Such fibers arecalled multimode fibers, their core being usually 50 micrometer in diameter. The modes couple easily, actingon the qubit like a nonisolated environment. Hence multimode fibers are not appropriate as quantum channelssee however Townsend 1998a and 1998b. If, however,the core is small enough diameter of the order of a fewwavelengths then a single spatial mode is guided. Suchfibers are called singlemode fibers. For telecommunications wavelength i.e. 1.3 and 1.5 m, their core is typically 8 m in diameter. Singlemode fibers are very wellsuited to carry single quanta. For example, the opticalphase at the output of a fiber is in a stable relation withthe phase at the input, provided the fiber doesnt getelongated. Hence, fiber interferometers are very stable, afact exploited in many instruments and sensors see, e.g.,Cancellieri 1993.Accordingly, a singlemode fiber with perfect cylindricsymmetry would provide an ideal quantum channel. Butall real fibers have some asymmetries and then the twopolarization modes are no longer degenerate but each hasits own propagation constant. A similar effect is causedby chromatic dispersion, where the group delay dependson the wavelength. Both dispersion effects are the subject of the next paragraphs.2. Polarization effects in singlemode fibersPolarization effects in singlemode fibers are a commonsource of problems in all optical communication schemes,as well classical as quantum ones. In recent years this hasbeen a major topic for RD in classical optical communication Gisin et al. 1995. As a result, todays fibersare much better than the fibers a decade ago. Nowadays, the remaining birefringence is small enough for thetelecom industry, but for quantum communication, anybirefringence, even extremely small, will always remaina concern. All fiber based implementations of QC haveto face this problem. This is clearly true for polarizationbased systems but it is equally a concern for phase basedsystems, since the interference visibility depends on thepolarization states. Hence, although polarization effectsare not the only source of difficulties, we shall describethem in some detail, distinguishing between 4 effects thegeometrical one, birefringence, polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent losses.The Geometric phase as encountered when guidinglight in an optical fiber is a special case of the Berryphase19 which results when any parameter describing aproperty of the system under concern, here the kvectorcharacterizing the propagation of the light field, undergoes an adiabatic change. Think first of a linear polarization state, lets say vertical at the input. Will it stillbe vertical at the output Vertical with respect to whatCertainly not the gravitational field One can follow thatlinear polarization by hand along the fiber and see howit may change even along a closed loop. If the loop staysin a plane, the state after a loop coincides with the inputstate. But if the loop explores the 3 dimensions of ourspace, then the final state will differ from the initial oneby an angle. Similar reasoning holds for the axes of elliptical polarization states. The two circular polarizationstates are the eigenstates during parallel transport theyacquire opposite phases, called the Berry phase. Thepresence of a geometrical phase is not fatal for quantumcommunication, it simply means that initially Alice andBob have to align their systems by defining for instancethe vertical and diagonal directions i.e. performing theunitary transformation mentioned before. If these varyslowly, they can be tracked, though this requires an active feedback. However, if the variations are too fast,the communication might be interrupted. Hence, aerialcables that swing in the wind are not appropriate except with selfcompensating configurations, see paragraphIVC2.Birefringence is the presence of two different phasevelocities for two orthogonal polarization states. It iscaused by asymmetries in the fiber geometry and in theresidual stress distribution inside and around the core.Some fibers are made birefringent on purpose. Suchfibers are called polarization maintaining PM fibers because the birefringence is large enough to effectively uncouple the two polarization eigenmodes. But note thatonly these two orthogonal polarization modes are maintained all the other modes, on the contrary, evolve veryquickly, making this kind of fiber completely unsuitablefor polarizationbased QC systems20. The global effectof the birefringence is equivalent to an arbitrary combination of two waveplates, that is, it corresponds to aunitary transformation. If this transformation is stable,19Introduced by Michael Berry in 1984, then observed inoptical fiber by Tomita and Chiao 1986, and on the singlephoton level by Hariharan et al. 1993, studied in connectionto photon pairs by Brendel et al. 1995.20PM fibers might be of use for phase based QC systems.However, this requires the whole setup  transmission linesas well as interferometers at Alices and Bobs  to be madeof PM fibers. While this is principally possible, the need ofinstalling a completely new fiber network makes this solutionnot very practical.15Alice and Bob can compensate for it. The effect of birefringence is thus similar to the geometrical effect, though,in addition to a rotation, it may also affect the ellipticity. Stability of birefringence requires slow thermal andmechanical variations.Polarization Mode Dispersion PMD is the presence of two different group velocities for two orthogonalpolarization modes. It is due to a delicate combinationof two causes. First, birefringence produces locally twogroup velocities. For optical fibers, this local modal dispersion is in good approximation equal to the phase dispersion, of the order of a few pskm. Hence, locally anoptical pulse tends to split into a fast mode and a slowmode. But because the birefringence is small, the twomodes couple easily. Hence any small imperfection alongthe fiber produces polarization mode coupling some energy of the fast mode couples into the slow mode andviceversa. PMD is thus similar to a random walk21 andgrows only with the square root of the fiber length. Itis expressed in pskm, with values as low as 0.1 pskmformodern fibers and possibly as high as 0.5 or even 1 pskmfor older ones.Typical lengths for the polarization mode couplingvary from a few meters up to hundreds of meters. Thestronger the coupling, the weaker the PMD the twomodes do not have time to move away between the couplings. In modern fibers, the couplings are even artificially increased during the drawing process of the fibersHart et al. 1994, Li and Nolan 1998. Since the couplings are exceedingly sensitive, the only reasonable description is a statistical one, hence PMD is described asa statistical distribution of delays  . For long enoughfibers, the statistics is Maxwellian and PMD is related tothe fiber length , the mean coupling length h, the meanmodal birefringence B and to the RMS delay as followsGisin et al. 1995 PMD 2  Bhh.PMD could cause depolarization which would be devastating for quantum communication, similar to any decoherence in quantum information processing. But fortunately, for quantum communication the remedy is easy, itsuffices to use a source with a coherence time larger thanthe largest delay  . Hence, when laser pulses are usedwith typical spectral widths   1 nm, correspondingto a coherence time  3 ps, see paragraph IIIA 1, PMDis no real problem. For photons created by parametricdown conversion, however, PMD can impose severe limitations since   10 nm coherence time  300 fs isnot unusual.Polarization Dependent Losses PDL is a differential attenuation between two orthogonal polarizationmodes. This effect is negligible in fibers, but can be sig21In contrast to Brownian motion describing particles diffusion in space as time passes, here photons diffuse in time asthey propagate along the fiber.nificant in components like phase modulators. In particular, some integrated optics waveguides actually guideonly one mode and thus behave almost like polarizerse.g. proton exchange waveguides in LiNbO3. PDLis usually stable, but if connected to a fiber with somebirefringence, the relation between the polarization stateand the PDL may fluctuate, producing random outcomesElamari et al. 1998. PDL cannot be described by a unitary operator acting in the polarization state space butit is of course unitary in a larger space Huttner et al.1996a. It does thus not preserve the scalar product. Inparticular, it can turn nonorthogonal states into orthogonal ones which can then be distinguished unambiguouslyat the cost of some loss Huttner et al. 1996a, Clarke etal. 2000. Note that this could be used by Eve, speciallyto eavesdrop on the 2state protocol paragraph IID 1.Let us conclude this paragraph on polarization effectsin fibers by mentioning that they can be passively compensated, provided one uses a goreturn configuration,using Faraday mirrors, as described in section IVC2.3. Chromatic dispersion effects in singlemode fibersIn addition to polarization effects, chromatic dispersion CD can cause problems for quantum cryptographyas well. For instance, as explained in sections IVC andVB, schemes implementing phase or phaseandtimecoding rely on photons arriving at well defined times,that is on photons well localized in space. However, indispersive media like optical fibers, different group velocities act as a noisy environment on the localization ofthe photon as well as on the phase acquired in an interferometer. Hence, the broadening of photons featuringnonzero bandwidth, or, in other words, the coupling between frequency and position must be circumvented orcontrolled. This implies working with photons of smallbandwidth, or, as long as the bandwidth is not too large,operating close to the wavelength 0 where chromaticdispersion is zero, i.e. for standard fibers around 1310nm. Fortunately, fiber losses are relatively small at thiswavelength and amount to 0.35 dBkm. This regionis called the second telecommunication window22. Thereare also special fibers, called dispersionshifted, with arefractive index profile such that the chromatic dispersion goes to zero around 1550 nm, where the attenuationis minimal Neumann 198823.22The first one, around 800 nm, is almost no longer used. Itwas motivated by the early existence of sources and detectorsat this wavelength. The third window is around 1550 nmwhere the attenuation reaches an absolute minimum Thomaset al. 2000 and where erbium doped fibers provide convenientamplifiers Desurvire 1994.23Chromatic dispersion in fibers is mainly due to the material, essentially silicon, but also to the refractive index profile.16CD does not constitute a problem in case of faint laserpulses where the bandwidth is small. However, it becomes a serious issue when utilizing photon pairs created by parametric downconversion. For instance, sending photons of 70 nm bandwidth as used in our longdistance Bell inequality tests, Tittel et al. 1998 down10 km of optical fibers leads to a temporal spread ofaround 500 ps assuming photons centered at 0 and atypical dispersion slope of 0.086 psnm2km . However, thiscan be compensated for when using energytime entangled photons Franson 1992, Steinberg et al. 1992a and1992b, Larchuk et al. 1995. In contrast to polarization coding where frequency and the physical propertyused to implement the qubit are not conjugate variables,frequency and time thus position constitute a Fourierpair. The strict energy anticorrelation of signal and idlerphoton enables one to achieve a dispersion for one photon which is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign tothat of the sister photon, corresponding thus to the samedelay24 see Fig. 7. The effect of broadening of the twowave packets then cancels out and two simultaneouslyemitted photons stay coincident. However, note that thearrival time of the pair varies with respect to its emissiontime. The frequency anticorrelation provides also thebasis for avoiding decrease of visibility due to differentwavepacket broadening in the two arms of an interferometer. And since the CD properties of optical fibers donot change with time  in contrast to birefringence  noonline tracking and compensation is required. It thusturns out that phase and phasetime coding is particularly suited to transmission over long distances in opticalfibers nonlinear effects decohering the qubit energyare completely negligible, and CD effects acting on thelocalization can be avoided or compensated for in manycases.4. Freespace linksAlthough telecommunication based on optical fibers isvery advanced nowadays, such channels may not alwaysbe available. Hence, there is also some effort in developing free space lineofsight communication systems not only for classical data transmission but for quantumcryptography as well see Hughes et al. 2000a and Gorman et al. 2000.Indeed, longer wavelengths feel regions further away from thecore where the refractive index is lower. Dispersionshiftedfibers have, however, been abandoned by todays industry, because it turned out to be simpler to compensate for the globalchromatic dispersion by adding an extra fiber with high negative dispersion. The additional loss is then compensated byan erbium doped fiber amplifier.24Assuming a predominantly linear dependence of CD infunction of the optical frequency, a realistic assumption.Transmission over free space features some advantages compared to the use of optical fibers. The atmosphere has a high transmission window at a wavelengthof around 770 nm see Fig. 8 where photons can easily be detected using commercial, high efficiency photoncounting modules see chapter III C 1. Furthermore, theatmosphere is only weakly dispersive and essentially nonbirefringent25 at these wavelengths. It will thus not alterthe polarization state of a photon.However, there are some drawbacks concerning freespace links as well. In contrast to transmitting a signalin a guiding medium where the energy is protected andremains localized in a small region in space, the energytransmitted via a freespace link spreads out, leading tohigher and varying transmission losses. In addition toloss of energy, ambient daylight, or even light from themoon at night, might couple into the receiver, leadingto a higher error rate. However, the latter errors can bemaintained at a reasonable level by using a combinationof spectral filtering  1 nm interference filters, spatialfiltering at the receiver and timing discrimination usinga coincidence window of typically a few ns. Finally, itis clear that the performance of freespace systems depends dramatically on atmospheric conditions and ispossible only with clear weather.Finally, let us briefly comment on the different sourcesleading to coupling losses. A first concern is the transmission of the signals through a turbulent medium, leading to arrivaltime jitter and beam wander hence problems with beam pointing. However, as the timescales foratmospheric turbulences involved are rather small around 0.1 to 0.01 s , the time jitter due to a variation of the effective refractive index can be compensatedfor by sending a reference pulse at a different wavelengthat short time around 100 ns before each signal pulse.Since this reference pulse experiences the same atmospheric conditions as the subsequent one, the signal willarrive essentially without jitter in the timewindow defined by the arrival of the reference pulse. In addition,the reference pulse can be reflected back to the transmitter and used to correct the direction of the laser beam bymeans of adaptive optics, hence to compensate for beamwander and to ensure good beam pointingAnother issue is the beam divergence, hence increase ofspot size at the receiver end caused by diffraction at thetransmitter aperture. Using for example 20 cm diameteroptics, the diffraction limited spot size after 300 km isof  1 m. This effect can in principle be kept smalltaking advantage of larger optics. However, it can alsobe of advantage to have a spot size large compared to thereceivers aperture in order to ensure constant couplingin case of remaining beam wander. In their 2000 paper,25In contrast to an optical fiber, air is not subject to stress,hence isotropic.17Gilbert and Hamrick provide a comprehensive discussionof freespace channels in the context of QC.C. Singlephoton detectionWith the availability of pseudo singlephoton andphotonpair sources, the success of quantum cryptography is essentially dependent on the possibility to detectsingle photons. In principle, this can be achieved usinga variety of techniques, for instance photomultipliers,avalanchephotodiodes, multichannel plates, superconducting Josephson junctions. The ideal detector shouldfulfill the following requirements it should feature a high quantum detection efficiency over a large spectral range, the probability of generating noise, that is a signalwithout a photon arriving, should be small, to ensure a good timing resolution, the time between detection of a photon and generation of anelectrical signal should be as constant as possible,i.e. the time jitter should be small, the recovery time i.e. the deadtime should besmall to allow high data rates.In addition, it is important to keep the detectorshandy. For instance, a detector which needs liquid helium or even nitrogen cooling would certainly render acommercial development difficult.Unfortunately, it turns out that it is impossible to meetall mentioned points at the same time. Today, the bestchoice is avalanche photodiodes APD. Three differentsemiconductor materials are used either Silicon, Germanium or Indium Gallium Arsenide, depending on thewavelengths.APDs are usually operated in socalled Geiger mode.In this mode, the applied voltage exceeds the breakdownvoltage, leading an absorbed photon to trigger an electron avalanche consisting of thousands of carriers. To reset the diode, this macroscopic current must be quenched the emission of charges stopped and the diode rechargedCova et al. 1996. Three main possibilities exist In passivequenching circuits, a large 50500 kresistor is connected in series with the APD seee.g. Brown et al. 1986. This causes a decrease ofthe voltage across the APD as soon as an avalanchestarts. When it drops below breakdown voltage,the avalanche stops and the diode recharges. Therecovery time of the diode is given by its capacitance and by the value of the quench resistor. Themaximum count rate varies from some hundred kHzto a few MHz. In active quenching circuits, the bias voltage isactively lowered below the breakdown voltage assoon as the leading edge of the avalanche currentis detected see e.g. Brown et al. 1987. Thismode enables higher count rates compared to passive quenching up to tens of MHz, since the deadtime can be as short as some tens of ns. However, the fast electronic feedback system rendersactive quenching circuits much more complicatedthan passive ones. Finally, in gated mode operation, the bias voltage is kept below the breakdown voltage and israised above only for a short time when a photonis expected to arrive, typically a few ns. Maximum countrates similar to active quenching circuits can be obtained using less complicated electronics. Gated mode operation is commonly used inquantum cryptography based on faint laser pulseswhere the arrivaltimes of the photons are wellknown. However, it only applies if prior timinginformation is available. For 2photon schemes, itis most often combined with one passive quencheddetector, generating the trigger signal for the gateddetector.Apart from Geiger mode, Brown et al. also investigated the performance of Silicon APDs operated in subGeiger mode Brown et al. 1989. In this mode, the biasvoltage is kept slightly smaller than the breakdown voltage such that the multiplication factor  around 100 already enables to detect an avalanche, however, is stillsmall enough to prevent real breakdowns. Unfortunately,the singlephoton counting performance in this mode israther bad and initial efforts have not been continued,the major problem being the need for extremely lownoiseamplifiers.An avalanche engendered by carriers created in theconduction band of the diode can not only be causedby an impinging photon, but also by unwanted causes.These might be thermal or bandtoband tunneling processes, or emissions from trapping levels populated whilea current transits through the diode. The first two causesproduce avalanches not due to photons and are referredto as darkcounts. The third process depends on previousavalanches and its effect is called afterpulses. Since thenumber of trapped charges decreases exponentially withtime, these afterpulses can be limited by applying largedeadtimes. Thus, there is a tradeoff between high countrates and low afterpulses. The timeconstant of the exponential decrease of afterpulses shortens for higher temperatures of the diode. Unfortunately, operating APDsat higher temperature leads to a higher fraction of thermal noise, that is higher dark counts. There is thus againa tradeoff to be optimized. Finally, increasing the biasvoltage leads to a larger quantum efficiency and a smallertime jitter, at the cost of an increase in the noise.18We thus see that the optimal operating parameters,voltage, temperature and dead time i.e. maximum countrate depend on the very application. Besides, since therelative magnitude of efficiency, thermal noise and after pulses varies with the type of semiconductor materialused, no general solution exists. In the two next paragraphs we briefly present the different types of APDs.The first paragraph focuses on Silicon APDs which enable the detection of photons at wavelengths below 1m,the second one comments on Germanium and on IndiumGallium Arsenide APDs for photon counting at telecommunication wavelength. The different behaviour of thethree types is shown in Fig. 9. Although the best figure of merit for quantum cryptography is the ratio ofdark count rate R per time unit to detection efficiency ,we depict here the betterknown noise equivalent powerNEP which shows similar behaviour. The NEP is defined as the optical power required to measure a unitysignaltonoise ratio, and is given byNEP h2R. 25Here, h is Plancks constant and  is the frequency of theimpinging photons.1. Photon counting at wavelengths below 1.1 mSince the beginning of the 80s, a lot of work hasbeen done to characterize Silicon APDs for single photon counting Ingerson 1983, Brown 1986, Brown 1987,Brown 1989, Spinelli 1996, and the performance of SiAPDs has continuously been improved. Since the firsttest of Bell inequality using SiAPDs by Shih and Alley in 1988, they have completely replaced the photomultipliers used until then in the domain of fundamentalquantum optics, known now as quantum communication.Today, quantum efficiencies of up to 76 Kwiat et al.1993 and time jitter down to 28 ps Cova et al. 1989have been reported. Commercial single photon countingmodules are available EGG SPCMAQ151, featuringquantum efficiencies of 70  at a wavelength of 700 nm, atime jitter of around 300 psec and maximum count rateslarger than 5 MHz. Temperatures of 20oC  sufficient tokeep thermally generated dark counts as low as 50 Hz can easily be achieved using Peltier cooling. Single photon counters based on Silicon APDs thus offer an almostperfect solution for all applications where photons of awavelength below 1 m can be used. Apart from fundamental quantum optics, this includes quantum cryptography in free space and in optical fibers, however, due tohigh losses, the latter one only over short distances.2. Photon counting at telecommunication wavelengthsWhen working in the second telecommunication window 1.3m, one has to take advantage of APDs madefrom Germanium or InGaAsInP semiconductor materials. In the third window 1.55 m, the only option isInGaAsInP APDs.Photon counting with Germanium APDs, althoughknown for 30 years Haecker, Groezinger and Pilkuhn1971, started to be used in the domain of quantum communication with the need of transmitting single photonsover long distances using optical fibers, hence with thenecessity to work at telecommunications wavelength. In1993, Townsend, Rarity and Tapster Townsend et al.1993a implemented a single photon interference schemefor quantum cryptography over a distance of 10 km, andin 1994, Tapster, Rarity and Owens 1994 demonstrateda violation of Bell inequalities over 4 km. These experiments where the first ones to take advantage of Ge APDsoperated in passively quenched Geiger mode. At a temperature of 77K which can be achieved using either liquidnitrogen or Stirling engine cooling, typical quantum efficiencies of about 15  at dark count rates of 25 kHzcan be found Owens et al. 1994, and time jitter downto 100 ps have been observed Lacaita et al. 1994  anormal value being 200300 ps.Traditionally, Germanium APDs have been implemented in the domain of longdistance quantum communication. However, this type of diode is currently getting replaced by InGaAs APDs and it is more and moredifficult to find Germanium APDs on the market. Motivated by pioneering research reported already in 1985Levine, Bethea and Campbell 1985, latest research focusses on InGaAs APDs, allowing single photon detectionin both telecommunication windows. Starting with workby Zappa et al. 1994, InGaAs APDs as single photoncounters have meanwhile been characterized thoroughlyLacaita et al. 1996, Ribordy et al. 1998, Hiskett et al.2000, Karlsson et al. 1999, and Rarity et al. 2000, Stuckiet al. 2001, and first implementations for quantum cryptography have been reported Ribordy 1998, Bourennaneet al. 1999, Bethune and Risk 2000, Hughes et al. 2000b,Ribordy et al. 2000. However, if operating Ge APDsis already inconvenient compared to Silicon APDs, thehandiness of InGaAs APDs is even worse, the problembeing a extremely high afterpulse fraction. Therefore,operation in passive quenching mode is impossible forapplications where noise is crucial. In gated mode, InGaAs APDs feature a better performance for single photon counting at 1.3 m compared to Ge APDs. For instance, at a temperature of 77 K and a dark count probability of 105 per 2.6 ns gate, quantum efficiencies ofaround 30 and of 17 have been reported for InGaAsand Ge APDs, respectively Ribordy et al. 1998, whilethe time jitter of both devices is comparable. If workingat a wavelength of 1.55 m, the temperature has to beincreased for single photon detection. At 173 K and adark count rate of now 104, a quantum efficiency of 6can still be observed using InGaAsInP devices while thesame figure for Germanium APDs is close to zero.To date, no industrial effort has been done to optimize APDs operating at telecommunication wavelength19for photon counting, and their performance is still farbehind the one of Silicon APDs26. However, there isno fundamental reasons why photon counting at wavelengths above 1 m should be more delicate than below,except that the photons are less energetic. The real reasons for the lack of commercial products are, first, thatSilicon, the most common semiconductor, is not sensitivethe band gap is too large, and secondly that the market for photon counting is not yet mature. But, withoutgreat risk, one can forecast that good commercial photon counters will become available in the near future, andthat this will have a major impact on quantum cryptography.D. Quantum random number generatorsThe key used in the onetimepad must be secret andused only once. Consequently, it must be as long as themessage and must be perfectly random. The later pointproves to be a delicate and interesting one. Computersare deterministic systems that cannot create truly random numbers. But all secure cryptosystems, both classical and quantum ones, require truly random numbers27Hence, the random numbers must be created by a random physical process. Moreover, to make sure that therandom process is not merely looking random with somehidden deterministic pattern, it is necessary that it iscompletely understood. It is thus of interest to implement a simple process in order to gain confidence in itsproper operation.A natural solution is to rely on the random choice ofa single photon at a beamsplitter28 Rarity et al. 1994.In this case the randomness is in principle guaranteed bythe laws of quantum mechanics, though, one still has tobe very careful not to introduce any experimental artefact that could correlate adjacent bits. Different experimental realizations have been demonstrated Hildebrand2001, Stefanov et al. 2000, Jennewein et al. 2000aand prototypes are commercially available www.gapoptique.unige.ch. One particular problem is the deadtime of the detectors, that may introduce a strong anticorrelation between neighboring bits. Similarly, afterpulses may provoke a correlation. These detectorrelatedeffects increase with higher pulse rates, limiting the bitrate of quantum number generator to some MHz.26The first commercial photon counter at telecommunicationwavelengths came out only this year Hamamatsu photomultiplier R550972. However, the efficiency does not yet allowan implementation for quantum cryptography.27The pin number that the bank attributes to your creditcard must be random. If not, someone knows it28Strictly speaking, the choice is made only once the photonsare detected at one of the outports.In the BB84 protocol Alice has to choose randomlybetween four different states and Bob between two bases.The limited random number generation rate may forceAlice to produce her numbers in advance and store them,opening a security weakness. On Bobs side the randombit creation rate can be lower since, in principle, the basismust be changed only after a photon has been detected,which normally happens at rates below 1 MHz. However,one has to make sure that this doesnt give the spy anopportunity for a Trojan horse attack see section VIKAn elegant configuration integrating the random number generator into the QC system consists in using a passive choice of bases, as discussed in chapter V Muller etal. 1993. However, the problem of detector inducedcorrelation remains.E. Quantum repeatersTodays fiber based QC systems are limited to tens ofkilometers. This is due to the combination of fiber lossesand detectors noise. The losses by themselves do onlyreduce the bit rate exponentially with the distance, butwith perfect detectors the distance would not be limited.However, because of the dark counts, each time a photon is lost there is a chance that a dark count producesan error. Hence, when the probability of a dark countbecomes comparable to the probability that a photonis correctly detected, the signal to noise ratio tends to0 more precisely the mutual information I,  tendsto a lower bound29. In this section we briefly explainhow the use of entangled photons and of entanglementswapping Zukowski et al. 1993 could open ways toextend the achievable distances in a foreseeable futuresome prior knowledge of entanglement swapping is assumed. Let us denote tlink the transmission coefficienti.e. tlinkprobability that a photon sent by Alice getsto one of Bobs detectors,  the detectors efficiency andpdark the dark count probability per time bin. With aperfect single photon source, the probability Praw of acorrect qubit detection reads Praw  tlink, while theprobability Pdet of an error is Pdet  1  tlinkpdark.Accordingly, the QBER PdetPrawPdet and the normalizednet rate reads net  Praw  Pdet  fctQBER wherethe function fct denotes the fraction of bits remainingafter error correction and privacy amplification. For thesake of illustration we simply assume a linear dependencedropping to zero for QBER 15 This simplificationdoes not affect the qualitative results of this section.For a more precise calculation, see Lutkenhaus 2000.29The absolute lower bound is 0, but dependening on theassumed eavesdropping strategy, Eve could take advantage ofthe losses. In the latter case, the lower bound is given by hermutual information I, .20fctQBER  1  QBER15 . The corresponding net ratenet is displayed on Fig. 10. Note that it drops to zeronear 90 km.Let us now assume that instead of a perfect singlephoton source, Alice and Bob use a perfect 2photonsource set in the middle of their quantum channel. Eachphoton has then a probabilitytlink to get to a detector. The probability of a correct joined detection is thusPraw  tlink2, while an error occurs with probabilityPdet  1tlink2p2dark 2tlink1tlinkpdarkboth photon lost and 2 dark counts, or one photonlost and one dark count. This can be convenientlyrewritten as Praw  tlinkn and Pdet  t1nlink  1 t1nlinkpdarkn  tlinkn valid for any division of the linkinto n equallength sections and n detectors. Note thatthe measurements performed at the nodes between Aliceand Bob do transmit swap the entanglement to the twinphotons, without revealing any information about thequbit these measurements are called Bellmeasurementsand are the core of entanglement swapping and of quantum teleportation. The corresponding net rates are displayed in Fig. 10. Clearly, the rates for short distancesare smaller when several detectors are used, because oftheir limited efficiencies here we assume   10. Butthe distance before the net rate drops to zero is extendedto longer distances Intuitively, this can be understoodas follows. Lets consider that a logical qubit propagatesfrom Alice to Bob although some photons propagate inthe opposite direction. Then, each 2photon source andeach Bellmeasurement acts on this logical qubit as a kindof QNDmeasurement they test whether the logical qubitis still there In this way, Bob activates his detectors onlywhen there is a large chance t1nlink that the photon getsto his detectors.Note that if in addition to the detectors noise thereis noise due to decoherence, then the above idea can beextended, using entanglement purification. This is essentially the idea of quantum repeaters Briegel et al. 1998,Dur et al. 1999.IV. EXPERIMENTAL QUANTUMCRYPTOGRAPHY WITH FAINT LASERPULSESExperimental quantum key distribution was demonstrated for the first time in 1989 it was published onlyin 1992 by Bennett et al. 1992a. Since then, tremendous progress has been made. Today, several groups haveshown that quantum key distribution is possible, evenoutside the laboratory. In principle, any twolevel quantum system could be used to implement QC. In practice,all implementations have relied on photons. The reasonis that their interaction with the environment, also calleddecoherence, can be controlled and moderated. In addition, researchers can benefit from all the tools developedin the past two decades for optical telecommunications.It is unlikely that other carriers will be employed in theforeseeable future.Comparing different QCsetups is a difficult task, sinceseveral criteria must be taken into account. What matters in the end is of course the rate of corrected secret bitsdistilled bit rate, Rdist that can be transmitted and thetransmission distance. One can already note that withpresent and near future technology, it will probably notbe possible to achieve rates of the order of gigahertz,nowadays common with conventional optical communication systems in their comprehensive paper publishedin 2000, Gilbert and Hamrick discuss practical methodsto achieve high bit rate QC. This implies that encryption with a key exchanged through QC is to be limitedto highly confidential information. While the determination of the transmission distance and rate of detectionthe raw bit rate, Rraw is straightforward, estimatingthe net rate is rather difficult. Although in principle errors in the bit sequence follow only from tampering bya malevolent eavesdropper, the situation is rather different in reality. Discrepancies in the keys of Alice andBob also always happen because of experimental imperfections. The error rate here called quantum bit errorrate, or QBER can be easily determined. Similarly, theerror correction procedure is rather simple. Error correction leads to a first reduction of the key rate that depends strongly on the QBER. The real problem consistin estimating the information obtained by Eve, a quantity necessary for privacy amplification. It does not onlydepend on the QBER, but also on other factors, like thephoton number statistics of the source, or the way thechoice of the measurement basis is made. Moreover ina pragmatic approach, one might also accept restrictionson Eves technology, limiting her strategies and therefore also the information she can obtain per error sheintroduces. Since the efficiency of privacy amplificationrapidly decreases when the QBER increases, the distilledbit rate depends dramatically on Eves information andhence on the assumptions made. One can define as themaximum transmission distance, the distance where thedistilled rate reaches zero. This can give an idea of the21difficulty to evaluate a QC system from a physical pointof view.Technological aspects must also be taken into account.In this article we do not focus on all the published performances in particular not on the key rates, whichstrongly depend on present technology and the financialpossibilities of the research teams having carried out theexperiments. On the contrary, we try to weight the intrinsic technological difficulties associated with each setup and to anticipate certain technological advances. Andlast but not least the cost of the realization of a prototypeshould also be considered.In this chapter, we first deduce a general formula forthe QBER and consider its impact on the distilled rate.We then review faint pulses implementations. We classthem according to the property used to encode the qubitsvalue and follow a rough chronological order. Finally, weassess the possibility to adopt the various setups for therealization of an industrial prototype. Systems based onentangled photon pairs are presented in the next chapter.A. Quantum Bit Error RateThe QBER is defined as the number of wrong bits tothe total number of received bits30 and is normally inthe order of a few percent. In the following we will useit expressed as a function of ratesQBER NwrongNright NwrongRerrorRsift Rerror RerrorRsift26where the sifted key corresponds to the cases in whichAlice and Bob made compatible choices of bases, henceits rate is half that of the raw key.The raw rate is essentially the product of the pulserate frep, the mean number of photon per pulse , theprobability tlink of a photon to arrive at the analyzer andthe probability  of the photon being detectedRsift 12Rraw 12q frep  tlink  27The factor q q1, typically 1 or 12  must be introducedfor some phasecoding setups in order to correct for noninterfering path combinations see, e.g., sections IVCand VB.One can distinguish three different contributions toRerror. The first one arises because of photons endingup in the wrong detector, due to unperfect interferenceor polarization contrast. The rate Ropt is given by the30In the followin we are considering systems implementingthe BB84 protocol. For other protocols some of the formulashave to be slightly adapted.product of the sifted key rate and the probability popt ofa photon going in the wrong detectorRopt  Rsift popt 12q frep  tlink popt  28This contribution can be considered, for a given setup,as an intrinsic error rate indicating the suitability to useit for QC. We will discuss it below in the case of eachparticular system.The second contribution, Rdet, arises from the detectordark counts or from remaining environmental stray lightin free space setups. This rate is independent of the bitrate31. Of course, only dark counts falling in a short timewindow when a photon is expected give rise to errors.Rdet 1212freppdarkn 29where pdark is the probability of registering a dark countper timewindow and per detector, and n is the number ofdetectors. The two 12 factors are related to the fact thata dark count has a 50 chance to happen with Alice andBob having chosen incompatible bases thus eliminatedduring sifting and a 50 chance to arise in the correctdetector.Finally error counts can arise from uncorrelated photons, because of imperfect photon sourcesRacc 1212paccfreptlinkn 30This factor appears only in systems based on entangledphotons, where the photons belonging to different pairsbut arriving in the same time window are not necessarilyin the same state. The quantity pacc is the probability tofind a second pair within the time window, knowing thata first one was created32.The QBER can now be expressed as followsQBER Ropt Rdet RaccRsift31 popt pdark  ntlink    2  q  pacc2  q   32 QBERopt QBERdet QBERacc 33We analyze now these three contributions. The firstone, QBERopt, is independent on the transmission distance it is independent of tlink. It can be considered asa measure of the optical quality of the setup, dependingonly on the polarisation or interference fringe contrast.31This is true provided that afterpulses see section IIICdo not contribute to the dark counts.32Note that a passive choice of measurement basis impliesthat four detectors or two detectors during two time windows are activated for every pulse, leading thus to a doublingof Rdet and Racc.22The technical effort needed to obtain, and more important, to maintain a givenQBERopt is an important criterion for evaluating different QCsetups. In polarizationbased systems, its rather simple to achieve a polarisation contrast of 1001, corresponding to a QBERopt of1. In fiber based QC, the problem is to maintain thisvalue in spite of polarisation fluctuations and depolarisation in the fiber link. For phase coding setups, QBERoptand the interference visibility are related byQBERopt 1 V234A visibility of 98 translates thus into an optical errorrate of 1. Such a value implies the use of well alignedand stable interferometers. In bulk optics perfect modeoverlap is difficult to achieve, but the polarization is stable. In singlemode fiber interferometers, on the contrary,perfect mode overlap is automatically achieved, but thepolarisation must be controlled and chromatic dispersioncan constitute a problem.The second contribution, QBERdet, increases with distance, since the darkcount rate remains constant whilethe bit rate goes down like tlink. It depends entirely onthe ratio of the dark count rate to the quantum efficiency.At present, good singlephoton detectors are not commercially available for telecommunication wavelengths. Thespan of QC is not limited by decoherence. As QBERoptis essentially independent of the fiber length, it is thedetector noise that limits the transmission distance.Finally, the QBERacc contribution is present only insome 2photon schemes in which multiphoton pulses areprocessed in such a way that they do not necessarilyencode the same bit value see e.g. paragraphs VB1and VB2. Indeed, although in all systems there is aprobability for multiphoton pulses, in most these contribute only to the information available to Eve see section VIH and not to the QBER. But for implementations featuring passive choice by each photon, the multiphoton pulses do not contribute to Eves information butto the error rate see section VI J.Now, let us calculate the useful bit rate as a function of the distance. Rsift and QBER are given as afunction of tlink in eq. 27 and 32 respectively. Thefiber link transmission decreases exponentially with thelength. The fraction of bits lost due to error correction and privacy amplification is a function of QBERand depends on Eves strategy. The number of remaining bits Rnet is given by the sifted key rate multipliedby the difference of the AliceBob mutual Shannon information I,  and Eves maximal Shannon informationImax, Rnet  RsiftI,  Imax, 35The latter are calculated here according to eq. 64 and66 section VIE, considering only individual attacksand no multiphoton pulses. We obtain Rnet useful bitrate after error correction and privacy amplification fordifferent wavelengths as shown in Fig. 11. There is firstan exponential decrease, then, due to error correctionand privacy amplification, the bit rates fall rapidly downto zero. This is most evident comparing the curves 1550nm and 1550 nm single since the latter features 10times less QBER. One can see that the maximum rangeis about 100 km. In practice it is closer to 50 km, dueto nonideal error correction and privacy amplification,multiphoton pulses and other optical losses not considered here. Finally, let us mention that typical key creation rates of the order of a thousand bits per second overdistances of a few tens of kilometers have been demonstrated experimentally see, for example, Ribordy et al.2000 or Townsend 1998b.B. Polarization codingEncoding the qubits in the polarization of photons isa natural solution. The first demonstration of QC byCharles Bennett and his coworkers Bennett et al. 1992amade use of this choice. They realized a system whereAlice and Bob exchanged faint light pulses produced bya LED and containing less than one photon on averageover a distance of 30 cm in air. In spite of the small scaleof this experiment, it had an important impact on thecommunity in the sense that it showed that it was notunreasonable to use single photons instead of classicalpulses for encoding bits.A typical system for QC with the BB84 four statesprotocol using the polarization of photons is shown inFig. 12. Alices system consists of four laser diodes. Theyemit short classical photon pulses  1ns polarized at45, 0, 45, and 90. For a given qubit, a singlediode is triggered. The pulses are then attenuated by aset of filters to reduce the average number of photons wellbelow 1, and sent along the quantum channel to Alice.It is essential that the pulses remain polarized for Bobto be able to extract the information encoded by Alice.As discussed in paragraph III B 2, polarization mode dispersion may depolarize the photons, provided the delayit introduces between both polarization modes is largerthan the coherence time. This sets a constraint on thetype of lasers used by Alice.When reaching Bob, the pulses are extracted from thefiber. They travel through a set of waveplates used to recover the initial polarization states by compensating thetransformation induced by the optical fiber paragraphIII B 2. The pulses reach then a symmetric beamsplitter, implementing the basis choice. Transmitted photonsare analyzed in the verticalhorizontal basis with a polarizing beamsplitter and two photon counting detectors.The polarization state of the reflected photons is first rotated with a waveplate by 45 45 to 0. The photonsare then analyzed with a second set of polarizing beamsplitter and photon counting detectors. This implements23the diagonal basis. For illustration, let us follow a photonpolarized at 45, we see that its state of polarization isarbitrarily transformed in the optical fiber. At Bobs end,the polarization controller must be set to bring it backto 45. If it chooses the output of the beamsplittercorresponding to the verticalhorizontal basis, it will experience equal reflection and transmission probability atthe polarizing beamsplittter, yielding a random outcome.On the other hand, if it chooses the diagonal basis, itsstate will be rotated to 90. The polarizing beamsplitter will then reflect it with unit probability, yielding adeterministic outcome.Instead of Alice using four lasers and Bob two polarizing beamsplitters, it is also possible to implement thissystem with active polarization modulators such as Pockels cells. For emission, the modulator is randomly activated for each pulse to rotate the state of polarizationto one of the four states, while, at the receiver, it randomly rotates half of the incoming pulses by 45. It isalso possible to realize the whole system with fiber opticscomponents.Antoine Muller and his coworkers at the University ofGeneva used such a system to perform QC experimentsover optical fibers 1993, see also Breguet et al. 1994.They created a key over a distance of 1100 meters withphotons at 800 nm. In order to increase the transmissiondistance, they repeated the experiment with photons at1300nm Muller et al.1995 and 1996 and created a keyover a distance of 23 kilometers. An interesting featureof this experiment is that the quantum channel connecting Alice and Bob consisted in an optical fiber part of aninstalled cable, used by the telecommunication companySwisscom for carrying phone conversations. It runs between the Swiss cities of Geneva and Nyon, under LakeGeneva Fig. 13. This was the first time QC was performed outside of a physics laboratory. It had a strongimpact on the interest of the wider public for the newfield of quantum communication.These two experiments highlighted the fact that thepolarization transformation induced by a long opticalfiber was unstable over time. Indeed, when monitoringthe QBER of their system, Muller noticed that, althoughit remained stable and low for some time of the order ofseveral minutes, it would suddenly increase after a while,indicating a modification of the polarization transformation in the fiber. This implies that a real fiber based QCsystem requires active alignment to compensate for thisevolution. Although not impossible, such a procedure iscertainly difficult. James Franson did indeed implementan active feedback aligment system  1995, but did notpursue along this direction. It is interesting to note thatreplacing standard fibers with polarization maintainingfibers does not solve the problem. The reason is that, inspite of their name, these fibers do not maintain polarization, as explained in paragraph III B 2.Recently, Paul Townsend of BT Laboratories also investigated such polarization encoding systems for QC onshortspan links up to 10 kilometers 1998a and 1998bwith photons at 800nm. It is interesting to note that,although he used standard telecommunications fiberswhich can support more than one spatial mode at thiswavelength, he was able to ensure singlemode propagation by carefully controlling the launching conditions.Because of the problem discussed above, polarizationcoding does not seem to be the best choice for QC inoptical fibers. Nevertheless, this problem is drasticallyimproved when considering free space key exchange, asthe air has essentially no birefringence at all see sectionIVE.C. Phase codingThe idea of encoding the value of qubits in the phaseof photons was first mentioned by Bennett in the paperwhere he introduced the twostates protocol 1992. It isindeed a very natural choice for optics specialists. Statepreparation and analysis are then performed with interferometers, that can be realized with singlemode opticalfibers components.Fig. 14 presents an optical fiber version of a MachZehnder interferometer. It is made out of two symmetriccouplers  the equivalent of beamsplitters  connectedto each other, with one phase modulator in each arm.One can inject light in the setup using a continuous andclassical source, and monitor the intensity at the outputports. Provided that the coherence length of the lightused is larger than the path mismatch in the interferometers, interference fringes can be recorded. Taking intoaccount the 2phase shift experienced upon reflectionat a beamsplitter, the effect of the phase modulators Aand B and the path length difference L, the intensity in the output port labeled 0 is given byI0  I  cos2A  B  kL236where k is the wave number and I the intensity of thesource. If the phase term is equal to 2  n where nis an integer, destructive interference is obtained. Therefore the intensity registered in port 0 reaches a minimum and all the light exits in port 1. When the phaseterm is equal to n, the situation is reversed constructive interference is obtained in port 0, while the intensity in port 1 goes to a minimum. With intermediatephase settings, light can be recorded in both ports. Thisdevice acts like an optical switch. It is essential to keepthe path difference stable in order to record stationaryinterferences.Although we discussed the behavior of this interferometer for classical light, it works exactly the same when asingle photon is injected. The probability to detect thephoton in one output port can be varied by changing thephase. It is the fiber optic version of Youngs slits experiment, where the arms of the interferometer replace theapertures.24This interferometer combined with a single photonsource and photon counting detectors can be used forQC. Alices setup consists of the source, the first couplerand the first phase modulator, while Bob takes the second modulator and coupler, as well as the detectors. Letus consider the implementation of the fourstates BB84protocol. On the one hand, Alice can apply one of fourphase shifts 0, 2, , 32 to encode a bit value. Sheassociates 0 and 2 to bit 0, and  and 32 to bit1. On the other hand, Bob performs a basis choice byapplying randomly a phase shift of either 0 or 2, andhe associates the detector connected to the output port0 to a bit value of 0, and the detector connected tothe port 1 to 1. When the difference of their phase isequal to 0 or , Alice and Bob are using compatible basesand they obtain deterministic results. In such cases, Alice can infer from the phase shift she applied, the outputport chosen by the photon at Bobs end and hence thebit value he registered. Bob, on his side, deduces fromthe output port chosen by the photon, the phase thatAlice selected. When the phase difference equals 2 or32, the bases are incompatible and the photon choosesrandomly which port it takes at Bobs coupler. This issummarized in Table 1. We must stress that it is essential with this scheme to keep the path difference stableduring a key exchange session. It should not change bymore than a fraction of a wavelength of the photons. Adrift of the length of one arm would indeed change thephase relation between Alice and Bob, and induce errorsin their bit sequence.Alice BobBit value A B A  B Bit value0 0 0 0 00 0 2 32 1  0  11  2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 01 32 0 32 1 32 2  1Table 1 Implementation of the BB84 fourstates protocol with phase encoding.It is interesting to note that encoding qubits with 2paths interferometers is formally isomorphic to polarization encoding. The two arms correspond to a natural basis, and the weights cj of each qubit state  c1ei2, c2ei2are determined by the coupling ratioof the first beam splitter while the relative phase  is introduced in the interferometer. The Poincare sphere representation, which applies to all twolevels quantum systems, can also be used to represent phasecoding states.In this case, the azimuth angle represents the relativephase between the light having propagated along the twoarms. The elevation corresponds to the coupling ratio ofthe first beamsplitter. States produced by a switch areon the poles, while those resulting from the use of a 5050beamsplitter lie on the equator. Figure 15 illustrates thisanalogy. Consequently, all polarization schemes can alsobe implemented using phase coding. Similarly, every coding using 2path interferometers can be realized using polarization. However, in practice one choice is often moreconvenient than the other, depending on circumstanceslike the nature of the quantum channel33.1. The double MachZehnder implementationAlthough the scheme presented in the previous paragraph works perfectly well on an optical table, it is impossible to keep the path difference stable when Alice andBob are separated by more than a few meters. As mentioned above, the relative length of the arms should notchange by more than a fraction of a wavelength. Considering a separation between Alice and Bob of 1 kilometerfor example, it is clear that it is not possible to preventpath difference changes smaller than 1m caused by environmental variations. In his 1992 letter, Bennett alsoshowed how to get round this problem. He suggested touse two unbalanced MachZehnder interferometers connected in series by a single optical fiber see Fig. 16,both Alice and Bob being equipped with one. Whenmonitoring counts as a function of the time since theemission of the photons, Bob obtains three peaks seethe inset in Fig. 16. The first one corresponds to thecases where the photons chose the short path both inAlices and in Bobs interferometers, while the last onecorresponds to photons taking twice the long paths. Finally, the central peak corresponds to photons choosingthe short path in Alices interferometer and the long onein Bobs, and to the opposite. If these two processes areindistinguishable, they produce interference. A timingwindow can be used to discriminate between interferingand noninterfering events. Disregarding the latter, it isthen possible for Alice and Bob to exchange a key.The advantage of this setup is that both halves ofthe photon travel in the same optical fiber. They experience thus the same optical length in the environmentallysensitive part of the system, provided that the variationsin the fiber are slower than their temporal separations,determined by the interferometers imbalance  5ns.This condition is much less difficult to fulfill. In order toobtain a good interference visibility, and hence a low error rate, the imbalancements of the interferometers must33Note, in addition, that using manypath interferometersopens up the possibility to code quantum systems of dimensions larger than 2, like qutrits, ququarts, etc. BechmannPasquinucci and Tittel 2000, BechmannPasquinucci andPeres 2000, Bourennane et al. 2001a.25be equal within a fraction of the coherence time of thephotons. This implies that the path differences must bematched within a few millimeters, which does not constitute a problem. Besides, the imbalancement must bechosen so that it is possible to clearly distinguish thethree temporal peaks and thus discriminate interferingfrom noninterfering events. It must then typically belarger than the pulse length and than the timing jitterof the photon counting detectors. In practice, the secondcondition is the most stringent one. Assuming a timejitter of the order of 500ps, an imbalancement of at least1.5ns keeps the overlap between the peaks low.The main difficulty associated with this QC scheme isthat the imbalancements of Alices and Bobs interferometers must be kept stable within a fraction of the wavelength of the photons during a key exchange to maintaincorrect phase relations. This implies that the interferometers must lie in containers whose temperature is stabilized. In addition, for long key exchanges an activesystem is necessary to compensate the drifts34. Finally,in order to ensure the indistinguishability of both interfering processes, one must make sure that in each interferometer the polarization transformation induced by theshort path is the same as the one induced by the long one.Alice as much as Bob must then use a polarization controller to fulfill this condition. However, the polarizationtransformation in short optical fibers whose temperatureis kept stable, and which do not experience strains, israther stable. This adjustment does thus not need to berepeated frequently.Paul Tapster and John Rarity from DERA workingwith Paul Townsend were the first ones to test this system over a fiber optic spool of 10 kilometers 1993a and1993b. Townsend later improved the interferometer byreplacing Bobs input coupler by a polarization splitterto suppress the lateral noninterfering peaks 1994. Inthis case, it is unfortunately again necessary to align thepolarization state of the photons at Bobs, in addition tothe stabilization of the interferometers imbalancement.He later thoroughly investigated key exchange with phasecoding and improved the transmission distance Marandand Townsend 1995, Townsend 1998b. He also testedthe possibility to multiplex at two different wavelengthsa quantum channel with conventional data transmissionover a single optical fiber Townsend 1997a. RichardHughes and his coworkers from Los Alamos NationalLaboratory also extensively tested such an interferome34Polarization coding requires the optimization of three parameters three parameters are necessary for unitary polarization control. In comparison, phase coding requires optimization of only one parameter. This is possible because thecoupling ratios of the beamsplitters are fixed. Both solutionswould be equivalent if one could limit the polarization evolution to rotations of the elliptic states, without changes in theellipticity.ter 1996 and 2000b, up to distances of 48 km of installedoptical fiber 35.2. The PlugPlay systemsAs discussed in the two previous sections, both polarization and phase coding require active compensation ofoptical path fluctuations. A simple approach would beto alternate between adjustment periods, where pulsescontaining large numbers of photons are exchanged between Alice and Bob to adjust the compensating systemcorrecting for slow drifts in phase or polarization, andqubits transmission periods, where the number of photons is reduced to a quantum level.An approach invented in 1989 by Martinelli, then atCISE Tecnologie Innovative in Milano, allows to automatically and passively compensate all polarization fluctuations in an optical fiber see also Martinelli, 1992.Let us consider first what happens to the state of polarization of a pulse of light travelling through an optical fiber, before being reflected by a Faraday mirror a mirror with a 4 Faraday rotator36  in front, andcoming back. We must first define a convenient description of the change in polarization of light reflected bya mirror under perpendicular incidence. Let the mirrorbe in the xy plane and z be the optical axis. Clearly,all linear polarization states are unchanged by a reflection. But righthanded circular polarization is changedinto lefthanded and viceversa. Actually, after a reflection the rotation continues in the same sense, but sincethe propagation direction is reversed, righthanded andlefthanded are swapped. The same holds for elliptic polarization states the axes of the ellipse are unchanged,35Note that in this experiment Hughes and his coworkersused an unusually high mean number of photons per pulseThey used a mean photon number of approximately 0.6 inthe central interference peak, corresponding to a   1.2 inthe pulses leaving Alice. The latter value is the relevant onefor an eavesdropping analysis, since Eve could use an interferometer  conceivable with present technology  where thefirst coupler is replaced by an optical switch and which allowsher to exploit all the photons sent by Alice.. In the light ofthis high  and of the optical losses 22.8 dB, one may arguethat this implementation was not secure, even when takinginto account only socalled realistic eavesdropping strategiessee VI I. Finally, it is possible to estimate the results thatother groups would have obtained if they had used a similarvalue of . One then finds that key distribution distancesof the same order could have been achieved. This illustratesthat the distance is a somewhat arbitrary figure of merit fora QC system.36These components, commercially available, are extremelycompact and convenient when using telecommunicationswavelengths, which is not true for other wavelengths.26but right and left are exchanged. Accordingly, on thePoincare sphere the polarization transformation upon reflection is described by a symmetry through the equatorial plane the north and south hemispheres are exchanged m  m1,m2,m3. Or in terms of the qubitstate vectorT 122137This is a simple representation, but some attention hasto be paid. Indeed this transformation is not a unitaryone Actually, the above description switches from arighthanded reference frame XY Z to a left handed oneXY Z, where Z  Z. There is nothing wrong in doingso and this explains the nonunitary polarization transformation37. Note that other descriptions are possible,but they require to artificially break the XY symmetry.The main reason for choosing this particular transformation is that the description of the polarization evolutionin the optical fiber before and after the reflection is thenstraightforward. Indeed, let U  eiB2 describe thisevolution under the effect of some modal birefringenceB in a fiber section of length   is the vector whosecomponents are the Pauli matrices. Then, the evolutionafter reflection is simply described by the inverse operator U1  eiB2. Now that we have a description forthe mirror, let us add the Faraday rotator. It producesa 2 rotation of the Poincare sphere around the northsouth axis F  eiz4 see Fig. 17. Because theFaraday effect is nonreciprocal remember that it is dueto a magnetic field which can be thought of as producedby a spiraling electric current, the direction of rotationaround the northsouth axis is independent of the lightpropagation direction. Accordingly, after reflection onthe mirror, the second passage through the Faraday rotator rotates the polarization in the same direction seeagain Fig. 17 and is described by the same operator F .Consequently, the total effect of a Faraday mirror is tochange any incoming polarization state into its orthogonal state m  m. This is best seen on Fig. 17, but canalso be expressed mathematicallyFTF 122138Finally, the whole optical fiber can be modelled as consisting of a discrete number of birefringent elements. If37Note that this transformation is positive, but not completely positive. It is thus closely connected to the partialtransposition map Peres 1996. If several photons are entangled, then it is crucial to describe all of them in frames withthe same chirality. Actually that this is necessary is the content of the PeresHorodecki entanglement witness Horodeckiet al. 1996.there are N such elements in front of the Faraday mirror,the change in polarization during a round trip can beexpressed as recall that the operator FTF only changesthe sign of the corresponding Bloch vector m  U11 ...U1N FTFUN ...U1  FTF 39The output polarization state is thus orthogonal to theinput one, regardless of any birefringence in the fibers.This approach can thus correct for time varying birefringence changes, provided that they are slow compared tothe time required for the light to make a round trip afew hundreds of microseconds.By combining this approach with timemultiplexingin a long path interferometer, it is possible to implement a quantum cryptography system based on phasecoding where all optical and mechanical fluctuations areautomatically and passively compensated Muller et al.1997. We performed a first experiment in early 1997Zbinden et al., 1997, and a key was exchanged over aninstalled optical fiber cable of 23 km the same one as inthe case of polarization coding mentioned before. Thissetup features a high interference contrast fringe visibility of 99.8 and an excellent long term stability andclearly established the value of the approach for QC. Thefact that no optical adjustments are necessary earned itthe nickname of plug  play setup. It is interesting tonote that the idea of combining timemultiplexing withFaraday mirrors was first used to implement an opticalmicrophone Breguet and Gisin, 199538.However, our first realization still suffered from certainoptical inefficiencies, and has been improved since then.Similar to the setup tested in 1997, the new system isbased on time multiplexing as well, where the interferingpulses travel along the same optical path, however, indifferent time ordering. A schematic is shown in Fig. 18.Briefly, to understand the general idea, pulses emittedat Bobs can travel either via the short arm at Bobs, bereflected at the Faraday mirror FM at Alices and finally,back at Bobs, travel via the long arm. Or, they travelfirst via the long arm at Bobs, get reflected at Alices,travel via the short arm at Bobs and then superposewith the first mentioned possibility on beamsplitter C1.We now explain the realization of this scheme more indetail A short and bright laser pulse is injected in thesystem through a circulator. It splits at a coupler. Oneof the half pulses, labeled P1, propagates through theshort arm of Bobs setup directly to a polarizing beamsplitter. The polarization transformation in this arm isset so that it is fully transmitted. P1 is then sent ontothe fiber optic link. The second half pulse, labeled P2,38Note that since then, we have used this interferometer forvarious other applications nonlinear index of refraction measurement in fibers Vinegoni et al., 2000a, optical switchVinegoni et al., 2000b.27takes the long arm to the polarizing beamsplitter. Thepolarization evolution is such that it is reflected. A phasemodulator present in this long arm is left inactive so thatit imparts no phase shift to the outgoing pulse. P2 isalso sent onto the link, with a delay of the order of 200ns. Both half pulses travel to Alice. P1 goes through acoupler. The diverted light is detected with a classicaldetector to provide a timing signal. This detector is alsoimportant in preventing so called Trojan Horse attacksdiscussed in section VIK. The nondiverted light propagates then through an attenuator and a optical delayline  consisting simply of an optical fiber spool  whoserole will be explained later. Finally it passes a phasemodulator, before being reflected by Faraday mirror. P2follows the same path. Alice activates briefly her modulator to apply a phase shift on P1 only, in order to encodea bit value exactly like in the traditional phase codingscheme. The attenuator is set so that when the pulsesleave Alice, they do not contain more than a fraction of aphoton. When they reach the PBS after their return tripthrough the link, the polarization state of the pulses isexactly orthogonal to what it was when they left, thanksto the effect of the Faraday mirror. P1 is then reflectedinstead of being transmitted. It takes the long arm tothe coupler. When it passes, Bob activates his modulator to apply a phase shift used to implement his basischoice. Similarly, P2 is transmitted and takes the shortarm. Both pulses reach the coupler at the same time andthey interfere. Singlephoton detectors are then use torecord the output port chosen by the photon.We implemented with this setup the full four statesBB84 protocol. The system was tested once again onthe same installed optical fiber cable linking Geneva andNyon 23 km, see Fig. 13 at 1300 nm and observeda very low QBERopt  1.4 Ribordy et al. 1998 and2000. Proprietary electronics and software were developed to allow fully automated and userfriendly operationof the system. Because of the intrinsically bidirectionalnature of this system, great attention must be paid toRayleigh backscattering. The light traveling in an opticalfiber undergoes scattering by inhomogeneities. A smallfraction 1 of this light is recaptured by the fiberin the backward direction. When the repetition rate ishigh enough, pulses traveling to Alice and back from hermust intersect at some point along the line. Their intensity is however strongly different. The pulses are morethan a thousand times brighter before than after reflection from Alice. Backscattered photons can accompanya quantum pulse propagating back to Bob and inducefalse counts. We avoided this problem by making surethat pulses traveling from and to Bob are not present inthe line simultaneously. They are emitted in the formof trains by Bob. Alice stores these trains in her opticaldelay line, which consists of an optical fiber spool. Bobwaits until all the pulses of a train have reached him, before sending the next one. Although it completely solvesthe problem of Rayleigh backscattering induced errors,this configuration has the disadvantage of reducing theeffective repetition frequency. A storage line half long asthe transmission line amounts to a reduction of the bitrate by a factor of approximately three.Researchers at IBM developed a similar system simultaneously and independently Bethune and Risk, 2000,also working at 1300 nm. However, they avoided theproblems associated with Rayleigh backscattering, by reducing the intensity of the pulses emitted by Bob. Asthese cannot be used for synchronization purposes anylonger, they added a classical channel wavelength multiplexed 1550 nm in the line, to allow Bob and Aliceto synchronize their systems. They tested their setupon a 10 km long optical fiber spool. Both of these systems are equivalent and exhibit similar performances. Inaddition, the group of Anders Karlsson at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm verified in 1999 thatthis technique also works at a wavelength of 1550 nmBourennane et al., 1999 and Bourennane et al., 2000.These experiments demonstrate the potential of plug playlike systems for real world quantum key distribution. They certainly constitute a good candidate for therealization of prototypes.Their main disadvantage with respect to the other systems discussed in this section is that they are more sensitive to Trojan horse strategies see section VIK. Indeed,Eve could send a probe beam and recover it through thestrong reflection by the mirror at the end of Alices system. To prevent such an attack, Alice adds an attenuator to reduce the amount of light propagating throughher system. In addition, she must monitor the incomingintensity using a classical linear detector. Besides, systems based on this approach cannot be operated with atrue singlephoton source, and will thus not benefit fromthe progress in this field 39.D. Frequency codingPhase based systems for QC require phase synchronization and stabilization. Because of the high frequency ofoptical waves approximately 200 THz at 1550 nm, thiscondition is difficult to fulfill. One solution is to use selfaligned systems like the plugplay setups discussedin the previous section. Prof. Goedgebuer and his teamfrom the University of Besancon, in France, introducedan alternative solution Sun et al. 1995, Mazurenko et al.1997, Merolla et al. 1999 see also Molotkov 1998. Notethat the title of this section is not completely correct inthe sense that the value of the qubits is not coded in thefrequency of the light, but in the relative phase betweensidebands of a central optical frequency.39The fact that the pulses travel along a round trip impliesthat losses are doubled, yielding a reduced counting rate.28Their system is depicted in Fig. 19. A source emitsshort pulses of classical monochromatic light with angular frequency S . A first phase modulator PMA modulates the phase of this beam with a frequency   Sand a small modulation depth. Two sidebands are thusgenerated at frequencies S. The phase modulator isdriven by a radiofrequency oscillatorRFOA whose phaseA can be varied. Finally, the beam is attenuated so thatthe sidebands contain much less than one photon perpulse, while the central peak remains classical. After thetransmission link, the beam experiences a second phasemodulation applied by PMB. This phase modulator isdriven by a second radiofrequency oscillator RFOB withthe same frequency  and a phase B. These oscillatorsmust be synchronized. After passing through this device,the beam contains the original central frequency S, thesidebands created by Alice, and the sidebands created byBob. The sidebands at frequencies S   are mutuallycoherent and thus yield interference. Bob can then recordthe interference pattern in these sidebands, after removalof the central frequency and the higher order sidebandswith a spectral filter.To implement the B92 protocol see paragraph IID 1,Alice randomly chooses the value of the phase A, foreach pulse. She associates a bit value of 0 to the phase0 and the bit 1 to phase . Bob also chooses randomlywhether to apply a phase B of 0 or . One can see thatif A  B  0, the interference is constructive andBobs singlephoton detector has a nonzero probabilityof recording a count. This probability depends on thenumber of photons present initially in the sideband, aswell as the losses induced by the channel. On the otherhand, if A  B  , interference is destructive andno count will ever be recorded. Consequently, Bob caninfer, everytime he records a count, that he applied thesame phase as Alice. When a given pulse does not yielda detection, the reason can be that the phases appliedwere different and destructive interference took place. Itcan also mean that the phases were actually equal, butthe pulse was empty or the photon got lost. Bob cannotdecide between these two possibilities. From a conceptual point of view, Alice sends one of two nonorthogonalstates. There is then no way for Bob to distinguish between them deterministically. However he can perform ageneralized measurement, also known as a positive operator value measurement, which will sometimes fail to givean answer, and at all other times gives the correct one.Eve could perform the same measurement as Bob.When she obtains an inconclusive result, she could justblock both the sideband and the central frequency sothat she does not have to guess a value and does not riskintroducing an error. To prevent her from doing that,Bob verifies the presence of this central frequency. Nowif Eve tries to conceal her presence by blocking only thesideband, the reference central frequency will still havea certain probability of introducing an error. It is thuspossible to catch Eve in both cases. The monitoring ofthe reference beam is essential in all twostates protocolto reveal eavesdropping. In addition, it was shown thatthis reference beam monitoring can be extended to thefourstates protocol Huttner et al., 1995.The advantage of this setup is that the interferenceis controlled by the phase of the radiofrequency oscillators. Their frequency is 6 orders of magnitude smallerthan the optical frequency, and thus considerably easierto stabilize and synchronize. It is indeed a relatively simple task that can be achieved by electronic means. TheBesancon group performed key distribution with such asystem. The source they used was a DBR laser diodeat a wavelength of 1540 nm and a bandwidth of 1 MHz.It was externally modulated to obtain 50 ns pulses, thusincreasing the bandwidth to about 20 MHz. They usedtwo identical LiNbO3 phase modulators operating at afrequency 2  300MHz. Their spectral filter wasa FabryPerot cavity with a finesse of 55. Its resolutionwas 36 MHz. They performed key distribution over a20 km long singlemode optical fiber spool, recording aQBERopt contribution of approximately 4. They estimated that 2 can be attributed to the transmissionof the central frequency by the FabryPerot cavity. Notealso that the detector noise is relatively large due to thelarge pulse durations. Both these errors could be loweredby increasing the separation between the central peakand the sidebands, allowing reduced pulse widths, henceshorter detection times and lower darkcounts. Nevertheless, a compromise must be found since, in addition totechnical drawbacks of high speed modulation, the polarization transformation in an optical fiber depends onthe wavelength. The remaining 2 of the QBERopt isdue to polarization effects in the setup.This system is another possible candidate. Its mainadvantage is the fact that it could be used with a truesinglephoton source, if it existed. On the other hand,the contribution of imperfect interference visibility to theerror rate is significantly higher than that measured withplugplay systems. In addition, if this system is to betruly independent of polarization, it is essential to ensurethat the phase modulators have very low polarizationdependency. In addition, the stability of the frequencyfilter may constitute a practical difficulty.E. Free space lineofsight applicationsSince optical fiber channels may not always be available, several groups are trying to develop free space lineofsight QC systems, capable for example to distribute akey between buildings rooftops in an urban setting.It may of course sound difficult to detect single photons amidst background light, but the first experimentsdemonstrated the possibility of free space QC. Besides,sending photons through the atmosphere also has advantages, since this medium is essentially not birefringentsee paragraph III B 4. It is then possible to use plainpolarization coding. In addition, one can ensure a very29high channel transmission over large distances by choosing carefully the wavelength of the photons see againparagraph III B 4. The atmosphere has for example ahigh transmission window in the vicinity of 770 nmtransmission as high as 80 between a ground stationand a satellite, which happens to be compatible withcommercial silicon APD photon counting modules detection efficiency as high as 65 and low noise.The systems developed for free space applications areactually very similar to the one shown in Fig. 12. Themain difference is that the emitter and receiver are connected to telescopes pointing at each other, instead ofan optical fiber. The contribution of background lightto errors can be maintained at a reasonable level by using a combination of timing discrimination coincidencewindows of typically a few ns, spectral filtering  1 nminterference filters and spatial filtering coupling into anoptical fiber. This can be illustrated with the following simple calculation. Let us suppose that the isotropicspectral background radiance is 102 Wm2 nm sr at800 nm. This corresponds to the spectral radiance of aclear zenith sky with a sun elevation of 77 Zissis andLarocca, 1978. The divergence  of a Gaussian beamwith radius w0 is given by   w0. The product ofbeam telescope crosssection and solid angle, which is aconstant, is therefore w202  2. By multiplying theradiance by 2, one obtains the spectral power density.With an interference filter of 1 nm width, the power onthe detector is 6  1015 W, corresponding to 2  104 photons per second or 2  105 photons per ns time window.This quantity is approximately two orders of magnitudelarger than the dark count probability of Si APDs, butstill compatible with the requirements of QC. Besides theperformance of free space QC systems depends dramatically on atmospheric conditions and air quality. This isproblematic for urban applications where pollution andaerosols degrade the transparency of air.The first free space QC experiment over a distance ofmore than a few centimeters 40 was performed by Jacobsand Franson in 1996. They exchanged a key over a distance of 150 m in a hallway illuminated with standardfluorescent lighting and 75 m outdoor in bright daylightwithout excessive QBER. Hughes and his team were thefirst to exchange a key over more than one kilometer under outdoor nighttime conditions Buttler et al. 1998,and Hughes et al. 2000a. More recently, they even improved their system to reach a distance of 1.6 km underdaylight conditions Buttler et al. 2000. Finally Rarityand his coworkers performed a similar experiment wherethey exchanged a key over a distance of 1.9 km undernighttime conditions Gorman et al. 2000.40Remember that Bennett and his coworkers performed thefirst demonstration of QC over 30 cm in air Bennett et al.1992a.Before quantum repeaters become available and allowto overcome the distance limitation of fiber based QC,free space systems seem to offer the only possibility forQC over distances of more than a few dozens kilometers. A QC link could be established between groundbased stations and a low orbit 300 to 1200 km satellite. The idea is first to exchange a key kA between Aliceand a satellite, using QC, next to establish another keykB between Bob and the same satellite. Then the satellite publicly announces the value K  kA  kB obtainedafter an XOR of the two keys  represents here theXOR operator or equivalently the binary addition modulo 2 without carry. Bob subtracts then his key fromthis value to recover Alices key kA  K  kB 41. Thefact that the key is known to the satellite operator maybe at first sight seen as a disadvantage. But this pointmight on the contrary be a very positive one for the development of QC, since governments always like to keepcontrol of communications Although this has not yetbeen demonstrated, Hughes as well as Rarity have estimated  in view of their free space experiments  thatthe difficulty can be mastered. The main difficulty wouldcome from beam pointing  dont forget that the satellites will move with respect to the ground  and wandering induced by turbulences. In order to reduce this latterproblem the photons would in practice probably be sentdown from the satellite. Atmospheric turbulences are indeed almost entirely concentrated on the first kilometerabove the earth surface. Another possibility to compensate for beam wander is to use adaptative optics. Freespace QC experiments over distances of the order of 2km constitute major steps towards key exchange with asatellite. According to Buttler et al. 2000, the opticaldepth is indeed similar to the effective atmospheric thickness that would be encountered in a surfacetosatelliteapplication.F. Multiusers implementationsPaul Townsend and colleagues investigated the application of QC over multiuser optical fiber networksPhoenix et al 1995, Townsend et al. 1994, Townsend1997b. They used a passive optical fiber network architecture where one Alice  the network manager  isconnected to multiple network users i.e. many Bobs, seeFig. 20. The goal is for Alice to establish a verifiablysecure and unique key with each Bob. In the classicallimit, the information transmitted by Alice is gathered byall Bobs. However, because of their quantum behavior,41This scheme could also be used with optical fiber implementation provided that secure nodes exist. In the case of asatellite, one tacitly assumes that it constitutes such a securenode.30the photons are effectively routed at the beamsplitter toone, and only one, of the users. Using the double MachZehnder configuration discussed above, they tested suchan arrangement with three Bobs. Nevertheless, becauseof the fact that QC requires a direct and low attenuationoptical channel between Alice and Bob, the possibility toimplement it over large and complex networks appearslimited.V. EXPERIMENTAL QUANTUMCRYPTOGRAPHY WITH PHOTON PAIRSThe possibility to use entangled photon pairs for quantum cryptography was first proposed by Ekert in 1991.In a subsequent paper, he investigated, with other researchers, the feasibility of a practical system Ekert etal., 1992. Although all tests of Bell inequalities for areview, see for example, Zeilinger 1999 can be seen asexperiments of quantum cryptography, systems specifically designed to meet the special requirements of QC,like quick change of bases, were first implemented onlyrecently 42. In 1999, three groups demonstrated quantum cryptography based on the properties of entangledphotons. They were reported in the same issue of Phys.Rev. Lett. Jennewein et al. 2000b, Naik et al. 2000,Tittel et al. 2000, illustrating the fast progress in thestill new field of quantum communication.When using photon pairs for QC, one advantage liesin the fact that one can remove empty pulses, since thedetection of one photon of a pair reveals the presence ofa companion. In principle, it is thus possible to havea probability of emitting a nonempty pulse equal toone43. It is beneficial only because presently availablesinglephoton detector feature high dark count probability. The difficulty to always collect both photons of a pairsomewhat reduces this advantage. One frequently hearsthat photonpairs have also the advantage of avoidingmultiphoton pulses, but this is not correct. For a givenmean photon number, the probability that a nonemptypulse contains more than one photon is essentially thesame for weak pulses and for photon pairs see paragraphIIIA 2. Second, using entangled photons pairs preventsunintended information leakage in unused degrees of freedom Mayers and Yao 1998. Observing a QBER smallerthan approximately 15, or equivalently that Bells inequality is violated, indeed guarantees that the photonsare entangled and so that the different states are notfully distinguishable through other degrees of freedom.A third advantage was indicated recently by new andelaborate eavesdropping analyses. The fact that passivestate preparation can be implemented prevents multiphoton splitting attacks see section VI J.42This definition of quantum cryptography applies to the famous experiment by Aspect and his coworkers testing Bellinequalities with time varying analyzers Aspect et al., 1982.QC had however not yet been invented. It also applies to themore recent experiments closing the locality loopholes, likethe one performed in Innsbruck using fast polarization modulators Weihs et al. 1998 or the one performed in Genevausing two analyzers on each side Tittel et al. 1999 Gisin andZbinden 1999.43Photon pair sources are often, though not always, pumpedcontinuously. In these cases, the time window determined bya trigger detector and electronics defines an effective pulse.31The coupling between the optical frequency and theproperty used to encode the qubit, i.e. decoherence, israther easy to master when using faint laser pulses. However, this issue is more serious when using photon pairs,because of the larger spectral width. For example, for aspectral width of 5 nm FWHM  a typical value, equivalent to a coherence time of 1 ps  and a fiber with a typicalPMD of 0.2 pskm, transmission over a few kilometersinduces significant depolarization, as discussed in paragraph III B 2. In case of polarizationentangled photons,this gradually destroys their correlation. Although it is inprinciple possible to compensate this effect, the statisticalnature of the PMD makes this impractical44. Althoughperfectly fine for freespace QC see section IVE, polarization entanglement is thus not adequate for QC overlong optical fibers. A similar effect arises when dealingwith energytime entangled photons. Here, the chromaticdispersion destroys the strong timecorrelations betweenthe photons forming a pair. However, as discussed inparagraph III B 3, it is possible to passively compensatefor this effect using either additional fibers with oppositedispersion, or exploiting the inherent energy correlationof photon pairs.Generally speaking, entanglement based systems arefar more complex than faint laser pulses setups. Theywill most certainly not be used in the short term for therealization of industrial prototypes. In addition the current experimental key creation rates obtained with thesesystems are at least two orders of magnitude smaller thanthose obtained with faint laser pulses setups net rate inthe order of a few tens of bits per second rather than a fewthousands bits per second for a 10 km distance. Nevertheless, they offer interesting possibilities in the context of cryptographic optical networks The photon pairssource can indeed be operated by a key provider and situated somewhere in between potential QC customers. Inthis case, the operator of the source has no way to get anyinformation about the key obtained by Alice and Bob.It is interesting to emphasize the close analogy between1 and 2photon schemes, which was first noted by Bennett, Brassard and Mermin 1992. Indeed, in a 2photonscheme, one can always consider that when Alice detectsher photon, she effectively prepares Bobs photon in agiven state. In the 1photon analog, Alices detectorsare replaced by sources, while the photon pair source between Alice and Bob is bypassed. The difference betweenthese schemes lies only in practical issues, like the spectral widths of the light. Alternatively, one can look atthis analogy from a different point of view in 2photon44In the case of weak pulses we saw that a full round trip together with the use of Faraday mirrors circumvents the problem see paragraph IVC2. However, since the channel losson the way from the source to the Faraday mirror inevitablyincreases the empty pulses fraction, the main advantage ofphoton pairs vanishes in such a configuration.schemes, everything is as if Alices photon propagatedbackwards in time from Alice to the source and then forwards from the source to Bob.A. Polarization entanglementA first class of experiments takes advantage ofpolarizationentangled photon pairs. The setup, depictedin Fig. 21, is similar to the scheme used for polarizationcoding based on faint pulses. A twophoton source emitspairs of entangled photons flying back to back towardsAlice and Bob. Each photon is analyzed with a polarizing beamsplitter whose orientation with respect to acommon reference system can be changed rapidly. Twoexperiments, have been reported in the spring of 2000Jennewein et al. 2000b, Naik et al. 2000. Both usedphoton pairs at a wavelength of 700 nm, which were detected with commercial single photon detectors based onSilicon APDs. To create the photon pairs, both groupstook advantage of parametric downconversion in one ortwo BBO crystals pumped by an argonion laser. The analyzers consisted of fast modulators, used to rotate thepolarization state of the photons, in front of polarizingbeamsplitters.The group of Anton Zeilinger, then at the University ofInnsbruck, demonstrated such a cryptosystem, includingerror correction, over a distance of 360 meters Jenneweinet al. 2000b. Inspired by a test of Bell inequalitiesperformed with the same setup a year earlier Weihs etal., 1998, the twophoton source was located near thecenter between the two analyzers. Special optical fibers,designed for guiding only a single mode at 700 nm, wereused to transmit the photons to the two analyzers. Theresults of the remote measurements were recorded locallyand the processes of key sifting and of error correctionimplemented at a later stage, long after the distributionof the qubits. Two different protocols were implementedone based on Wigners inequality a special form of Bellinequalities, and the other one following BB84.The group of Paul Kwiat then at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory, demonstrated the Ekert protocol Naik et al.2000. This experiment was a tabletop realization withthe source and the analyzers only separated by a fewmeters. The quantum channel consisted of a short freespace distance. In addition to performing QC, the researchers simulated different eavesdropping strategies aswell. As predicted by the theory, they observed a rise ofthe QBER with an increase of the information obtainedby the eavesdropper. Moreover, they also recently implemented the sixstate protocol described in paragraphIID 2, and observed the predicted QBER increase to 33Enzer et al. 2001.The main advantage of polarization entanglement isthe fact that analyzers are simple and efficient. It istherefore relatively easy to obtain high contrast. Naikand coworkers, for example, measured a polarization32extinction of 97, mainly limited by electronic imperfections of the fast modulators. This amounts to aQBERopt contribution of only 1.5. In addition, theconstraint on the coherence length of the pump laser isnot very stringent note that if it is shorter than thelength of the crystal some difficulties can appear, but wewill not mention them here.In spite of their qualities, it would be difficult to reproduce these experiments on distances of more than a fewkilometers of optical fiber. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, polarization is indeed not robustenough to decoherence in optical fibers. In addition, thepolarization state transformation induced by an installedfiber frequently fluctuates, making an active alignmentsystem absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, these experiments are very interesting in the context of free spaceQC.B. Energytime entanglement1. PhasecodingThe other class of experiments takes advantage ofenergytime entangled photon pairs. The idea originatesfrom an arrangement proposed by Franson in 1989 totest Bell inequalities. As we will see below, it is comparable to the double MachZehnder configuration discussed in section IVC1. A source emits pairs of energycorrelated photons with both particles created at exactlythe same, however uncertain time see Fig. 22. Thiscan be achieved by pumping a nonlinear crystal witha pump of large coherence time. The pairs of downconverted photons are then split, and one photon is sentto each party down quantum channels. Both Alice andBob possess a widely, but identically unbalanced MachZehnder interferometer, with photon counting detectorsconnected to the outputs. Locally, if Alice or Bob changethe phase of their interferometer, no effect on the countrates is observed, since the imbalancement prevents anysinglephoton interference. Looking at the detectiontimeat Bobs with respect to the arrival time at Alices, threedifferent values are possible for each combination of detectors. The different possibilities in a time spectrumare shown in Fig. 22. First, both photons can propagatethrough the short arms of the interferometers. Next, onecan take the long arm at Alices, while the other onetakes the short one at Bobs. The opposite is also possible. Finally, both photons can propagate through thelong arms. When the path differences of the interferometers are matched within a fraction of the coherence lengthof the downconverted photons, the shortshort and thelonglong processes are indistinguishable, provided thatthe coherence length of the pump photon is larger thanthe pathlength difference. Conditioning detection onlyon the central time peak, one observes twophoton interferences which depends on the sum of the relative phasesin Alices and Bobs interferometer  nonlocal quantumcorrelation Franson 198945  see Fig. 22. The phasein the interferometers at Alices and Bobs can, for example, be adjusted so that both photons always emergefrom the same output port. It is then possible to exchange bits by associating values to the two ports. Thisis, however, not sufficient. A second measurement basismust be implemented, to ensure security against eavesdropping attempts. This can be done for example byadding a second interferometer to the systems see Fig.23. In the latter case, when reaching an analyzer, aphoton chooses randomly to go to one or the other interferometer. The second set of interferometers can beadjusted to also yield perfect correlations between output ports. The relative phase between their arms shouldhowever be chosen so that when the photons go to interferometers not associated, the outcomes are completelyuncorrelated.Such a system features a passive state preparation byAlice, yielding security against multiphoton splitting attacks see section VI J. In addition, it also features apassive basis choice by Bob, which constitutes an elegantsolution neither a random number generator, nor anactive modulator are necessary. It is nevertheless clearthat QBERdet and QBERacc defined in eq. 33 aredoubled since the number of activated detectors is twiceas high. This disadvantage is however not as importantas it first appears since the alternative, a fast modulator, introduces losses close to 3dB, also resulting in anincrease of these error contributions. The striking similarity between this scheme and the double MachZehnderarrangement discussed in the context of faint laser pulsesin section IVC1 is obvious when comparing Fig. 24 andFig. 16This scheme has been realized in the first half of 2000by our group at Geneva University Ribordy et al., 2001.It constitutes the first experiment in which an asymmetric setup, optimized for QC was used instead of a systemdesigned for tests of Bell inequality and having a sourcelocated in the center between Alice and Bob see Fig.25. The twophoton source a KNbO3 crystal pumpedby a doubled NdYAG laser provides energytime entangled photons at nondegenerate wavelengths  one around810 nm, the other one centered at 1550 nm. This choiceallows to use high efficiency silicon based single photoncounters featuring low noise to detect the photons of thelower wavelength. To avoid the high transmission lossesat this wavelength in optical fibers, the distance betweenthe source and the corresponding analyzer is very short,45The imbalancement of the interferometers must be largeenough so that the middle peak can easily be distinguishedfrom the satellite ones. This minimal imbalancement is determined by the convolution of the detectors jitter tens ofps, the electronic jitter from tens to hundreds of ps and thesinglephoton coherence time 1ps.33of the order of a few meters. The other photon, at thewavelength where fiber losses are minimal, is sent viaan optical fiber to Bobs interferometer and is then detected by InGaAs APDs. The decoherence induced bychromatic dispersion is limited by the use of dispersionshifted optical fiber see section III B 3.Implementing the BB84 protocols in the way discussedabove, with a total of four interferometers, is difficult.They must indeed be aligned and their relative phasekept accurately stable during the whole key distributionsession. To simplify this problem, we devised birefringentinterferometers with polarization multiplexing of the twobases. Consequently, the constraint on the stability of theinterferometers is equivalent to that encountered in thefaint pulses double MachZehnder system. We obtainedinterference visibilities of typically 92, yielding in turna QBERopt contribution of about 4. We demonstratedQC over a transmission distance of 8.5 km in a laboratorysetting using a fiber on a spool and generated severalMbits of key in hour long sessions. This is the largestspan realized to date for QC with photon pairs.As already mentioned, it is essential for this scheme tohave a pump laser whose coherence length is larger thanthe path imbalancement of the interferometers. In addition, its wavelength must remain stable during a key exchange session. These requirements imply that the pumplaser must be somewhat more elaborate than in the caseof polarization entanglement.2. Phasetime codingWe have mentioned in section IVC that states generated by twopaths interferometers are twolevels quantumsystems. They can also be represented on a Poincaresphere. The fourstates used for phase coding in theprevious section would lie on the equator of the sphere,equally distributed. The coupling ratio of the beamsplitter is indeed 50, and they differ only by a phase difference introduced between the components propagatingthrough either arm. In principle, the fourstate protocol can be equally well implemented with only two stateson the equator and the two other ones on the poles. Inthis section, we present a system exploiting such a setof states. Proposed by our group in 1999 Brendel etal., 1999, the scheme follows in principle the Fransonconfiguration described in the context of phase coding.However, it is based on a pulsed source emitting entangled photons in socalled energytime Bell states Tittelet al. 2000. The emission time of the photon pair istherefore given by a superposition of only two discreteterms, instead of a wide and continuous range boundedonly by the large coherence length of the pump laser seeparagraph VB1.Consider Fig. 26. If Alice registers the arrival timesof the photons with respect to the emission time of thepump pulse t0, she finds the photons in one of three timeslots note that she has two detectors to take into account. For instance, detection of a photon in the firstslot corresponds to pump photon having traveled via theshort arm and downconverted photon via the short arm.To keep it short, we refer to this process as  s P ,  s A,where P stands for the pump and A for Alices photon46. However, the characterization of the completephoton pair is still ambiguous, since, at this point, thepath of the photon having traveled to Bob short or longin his interferometer is unknown to Alice. Figure 26illustrates all processes leading to a detection in the different time slots both at Alices and at Bobs detector.Obviously, this reasoning holds for any combination oftwo detectors. In order to build up the secret key, Alice and Bob now publicly agree about the events whereboth detected a photon in one of the satellite peaks without revealing in which one  or both in the centralpeak  without revealing the detector. This procedurecorresponds to keysifting. For instance, in the examplediscussed above, if Bob tells Alice that he also detectedhis photon in a satellite peak, she knows that it musthave been the left peak as well. This is due to the factthat the pump photon has traveled via the short arm hence Bob can detect his photon either in the left satelliteor in the central peak. The same holds for Bob who nowknows that Alices photon traveled via the short arm inher interferometer. Therefore, in case of joint detectionin a satellite peak, Alice and Bob must have correlateddetection times. Assigning a bit value to each side peak,Alice and Bob can exchange a sequence of correlated bits.The cases where both find the photon in the centraltime slot are used to implement the second basis. Theycorrespond to the  s P ,  l A l B and  l P ,  s A s Bpossibilities. If these are indistinguishable, one obtainstwophoton interferences, exactly as in the case discussedin the previous paragraph on phase coding. Adjustingthe phases, and maintaining them stable, perfect correlations between output ports chosen by the photons atAlices and Bobs interferometers are used to establishthe key bits in this second basis.Phasetime coding has recently been implemented in alaboratory experiment by our group Tittel et al., 2000and was reported at the same time as the two polarization entanglementbased schemes mentioned above. Acontrast of approximately 93 was obtained, yielding aQBERopt contribution of 3.5, similar to that obtainedwith the phase coding scheme. This experiment will berepeated over long distances, since losses in optical fibersare low at the downconverted photons wavelength 1300nm.An advantage of this setup is that coding in the timebasis is particularly stable. In addition, the coherencelength of the pump laser is not critical anymore. It is46Note that it does not constitute a product state.34however necessary to use relatively short pulses  500ps powerful enough to induce a significant downconversion probability.Phasetime coding, as discussed in this section, canalso be realized with faint laser pulses BechmannPasquinucci and Tittel, 2000. The 1photon configuration has though never been realized. It would be similar to the double MachZehnder discussed in paragraphIVC1, but with the first coupler replaced by an activeswitch. For the timebasis, Alice would set the switcheither to full transmission or to full reflection, while forthe energybasis she would set it at 50. This illustrateshow considerations initiated on photon pairs can yieldadvances on faint pulses systems.3. Quantum secret sharingIn addition to QC using phasetime coding, we used thesetup depicted in Fig. 26 for the first proofofprincipledemonstration of quantum secret sharing  the generalization of quantum key distribution to more than twoparties Tittel et al., 2001. In this new application ofquantum communication, Alice distributes a secret key totwo other users, Bob and Charlie, in a way that neitherBob nor Charlie alone have any information about thekey, but that together they have full information. Likewith traditional QC, an eavesdropper trying to get someinformation about the key creates errors in the transmission data and thus reveals her presence. The motivationbehind quantum secret sharing is to guarantee that Boband Charlie cooperate  one of them might be dishonest in order to obtain a given piece of information. In contrast with previous proposals using threeparticle GHZstates Zukowski et al.,1998, and Hillery et al., 1999,pairs of entangled photons in socalled energytime Bellstates were used to mimic the necessary quantum correlation of three entangled qubits, albeit only two photons exist at the same time. This is possible becauseof the symmetry between the preparation device actingon the pump pulse and the devices analyzing the downconverted photons. Therefore, the emission of a pumppulse can be considered as the detection of a photon with100 efficiency, and the scheme features a much highercoincidence rate than that expected with the initially proposed triplephoton schemes.VI. EAVESDROPPINGA. Problems and ObjectivesAfter the qubit exchange and bases reconciliation, Alice and Bob each have a sifted key. Ideally, these areidentical. But in real life, there are always some errorsand Alice and Bob must apply some classical informationprocessing protocols, like error correction and privacyamplification, to their data see paragraph IIC 4. Thefirst protocol is necessary to obtain identical keys, thesecond to obtain a secret key. Essentially, the problemof eavesdropping is to find protocols which, given thatAlice and Bob can only measure the QBER, either provides Alice and Bob with a provenly secure key, or stopsthe protocol and informs the users that the key distribution has failed. This is a delicate question, really at theintersection between quantum physics and informationtheory. Actually, there is not one, but several eavesdropping problems, depending on the precise protocol, on thedegree of idealization one admits, on the technologicalpower one assumes Eve has and on the assumed fidelityof Alice and Bobs equipment. Let us immediately stressthat the complete analysis of eavesdropping on quantumchannel is by far not yet finished. In this chapter wereview some of the problems and solutions, without anyclaim of mathematical rigor nor complete cover of thehuge and fast evolving literature.The general objective of eavesdropping analysis is tofind ultimate and practical proofs of security for somequantum cryptosystems. Ultimate means that the security is guaranteed against entire classes of eavesdropping attacks, even if Eve uses not only the best of todays technology, but any conceivable technology of tomorrow. They take the form of theorems, with clearlystated assumptions expressed in mathematical terms. Incontrast, practical proofs deal with some actual pieces ofhardware and software. There is thus a tension betweenultimate and practical proofs. Indeed the first onesfavor general abstract assumptions, whereas the secondones concentrate on physical implementations of the general concepts. Nevertheless, it is worth aiming at findingsuch proofs. In addition to the security issue, they provide illuminating lessons for our general understandingof quantum information.In the ideal game Eve has perfect technology she isonly limited by the laws of quantum mechanics, but notat all by todays technology 47. In particular, Eve can47The question whether QC would survive the discovery ofthe currently unknown validity limits of quantum mechanicsis interesting. Let us argue that it is likely that quantum mechanics will always adequately describe photons at telecomand vsible wavelengths, like classical mechanics always adequately describes the fall of apples, whatever the future of35not clone the qubits, as this is incompatible with quantum dynamics see paragraph IIC 2, but Eve is free touse any unitary interaction between one or several qubitsand an auxiliary system of her choice. Moreover, afterthe interaction, Eve may keep her auxiliary system unperturbed, in particular in complete isolation from theenvironment, for an arbitrarily long time. Finally, after listening to all the public discussion between Aliceand Bob, she can perform the measurement of her choiceon her system, being again limited only by the laws ofquantum mechanics. Moreover, one assumes that all errors are due to Eve. It is tempting to assume that someerrors are due to Alices and Bobs instruments and thisprobably makes sense in practice. But there is the dangerthat Eve replaces them with higher quality instrumentssee next sectionIn the next section we elaborate on the most relevantdifferences between the above ideal game ideal especially from Eves point of view and real systems. Next,we return to the idealized situation and present severaleavesdropping strategies, starting from the simplest ones,where explicit formulas can be written down and endingwith a general abstract security proof. Finally, we discus practical eavesdropping attacks and comment on thecomplexity of real systems security.B. Idealized versus real implementationAlice and Bob use technology available today. Thistrivial remark has several implications. First, all realcomponents are imperfect, so that the qubits are prepared and detected not exactly in the basis described bythe theory. Moreover, a real source always has a finiteprobability to produce more than one photon. Dependingon the details of the encoding device, all photons carrythe same qubit see section VI J. Hence, in principle,Eve could measure the photon number, without perturbing the qubit. This is discussed in section VIH. Recallthat ideally, Alice should emit single qubitphotons, i.e.each logical qubit should be encoded in a single degreeof freedom of a single photon.On Bobs side the situation is, first, that the efficiencyof his detectors is quite limited and, next, that the darkcounts spontaneous counts not produced by photonsare non negligible. The limited efficiency is analogous tothe losses in the quantum channel. The analysis of thedark counts is more delicate and no complete solutionis known. Conservatively, Lutkenhaus 2000 assumesin his analysis that all dark counts provide informationto Eve. He also advises that whenever two detectorsfire simultaneously generally due to a real photon anda dark count, Bob should not disregard such events butphysics might be.choose a value at random. Note also that the differentcontributions of dark count to the total QBER dependon whether Bobs choice of basis is implemented using anactive or a passive switch see section IVA.Next, one usually assumes that Alice and Bob havethoroughly checked their equipments and that it is functioning according to the specifications. This is not particular to quantum cryptography, but is quite a delicatequestion, as Eve could be the actual manufacturer of theequipment Classical cryptosystems must also be carefully tested, like any commercial apparatuses. Testing acryptosystem is however delicate, because in cryptography the client buys confidence and security, two qualitiesdifficult to quantify. D. Mayers and A. Yao 1998 proposed to use Bell inequality to test that the equipmentsreally obey quantum mechanics, but even this is not entirely satisfactory. Indeed and interestingly, one of themost subtle loopholes in all present day tests of Bell inequality, the detection loophole, can be exploited to produce a purely classical software mimicking all quantumcorrelation Gisin and Gisin 1999. This illustrates onceagain how close practical issues in QC are to philosophical debates about the foundations of quantum physicsFinally, one has to assume that Alice and Bob are perfectly isolated from Eve. Without such an assumptionthe entire game would be meaningless clearly, Eve isnot allowed to look over Alices shoulder But this elementary assumption is again a nontrivial one. Whatif Eve uses the quantum channel connecting Alice to theoutside world Ideally, the channel should incorporate anisolator 48 to keep Eve from shining light into Alices output port to examine the interior of her laboratory. Butall isolators operate only on a finite bandwidth, hencethere should also be a filter. But filters have only a finiteefficiency. And so on. Except for section VIK where thisassumption is discussed, we henceforth assume that Aliceand Bob are isolated from Eve.C. Individual, joint and collective attacksIn order to simplify the problem, several eavesdropping strategies of restricted generalities have been definedLutkenhaus 1996, Biham and Mor 1997a and 1997b andanalyzed. Of particular interest is the assumption thatEve attaches independent probes to each qubit and measures her probes one after the other. This class of attacksis called individual attacks, also known as incoherent attacks. This important class is analyzed in sections VIDand VIE. Two other classes of eavesdropping strategies let Eve process several qubits coherently, hence thename of coherent attacks. The most general coherent at48Optical isolators, based on the Faraday effect, let light passthrough only in one direction.36tacks are called joint attacks, while an intermediate classassumes that Eve attaches one probe per qubit, like inindividual attacks, but can measure several probes coherently, like in coherent attacks. This intermediate class iscalled collective attacks. It is not known whether thisclass is less efficient than the most general joint one. It isalso not known whether it is more efficient than the simpler individual attacks. Actually, it is not even knownwhether joint attacks are more efficient than individualonesFor joint and collective attacks, the usual assumptionis that Eve measures her probe only after Alice and Bobhave completed all their public discussion about basesreconciliation, error correction and privacy amplification.But for the more realistic individual attacks, one assumesthat Eve waits only until the bases reconciliation phaseof the public discussion49. The motivation for this isthat one hardly sees what Eve could gain waiting for thepublic discussion on error correction and privacy amplification before measuring her probes, since she is anywaygoing to measure them independently.Individual attacks have the nice feature that the problem can be entirely translated into a classical one Alice,Bob and Eve all have classical information in the formof random variables ,  an , respectively, and the lawsof quantum mechanics imposes constraints on the jointprobability distribution P , , . Such classical scenarios have been widely studied by the classical cryptologycommunity and many results can thus be directly applied.D. Simple individual attacks interceptresend,measurement in the intermediate basisThe simplest attack for Eve consists in intercepting allphotons individually, to measure them in a basis chosen randomly among the two bases used by Alice and tosend new photons to Bob prepared according to her result. As presented in paragraph IIC 3 and assuming thatthe BB84 protocol is used, Eve gets thus 0.5 bit of information per bit in the sifted key, for an induced QBERof 25. Let us illustrate the general formalism on thissimple example. Eves mean information gain on Alicesbit, I, , equals their relative entropy decreaseI,   Ha priori Ha posteriori 40i.e. I,  is the number of bits one can save writing when knowing . Since the a priori probability for Alicesbit is uniform, Ha priori  1. The a posteriori entropy49With todays technology, it might even be fair to assume,in individual attacks, that Eve must measure her probe beforethe basis reconciliation.has to be averaged over all possible results r that Evemight getHa posteriori rP rHir 41Hir  iP ir logP ir 42where the a posteriori probability of bit i given Evesresult r is given by Bayess theoremP ir  P riP iP r43with P r i P riP i. In the case of interceptresend, Eve gets one out of 4 possible results r  , ,,. After the basis has been revealed, Alices inputassumes one out of 2 values i  ,  assuming the basis was used, the other case is completely analogous.One gets P i  r   1, P i  r   12 andP r  12 . Hence, I,   1 12h1 12h12   1 12  12with hp  p log2p  1 p log21 p.Another strategy for Eve, not more difficult to implement, consists in measuring the photons in the intermediate basis see Fig. 27, also known as the Breidbart basis Bennett et al. 1992a. In this way theprobability that Eve guesses the correct bit value isp  cos82  12 24  0.854, corresponding to aQBER2p1 p  25 and Shannon information gainper bit ofI  1Hp  0.399. 44Consequently, this strategy is less advantageous for Evethan the interceptresend one. Note however, that withthis strategy Eves probability to guess the correct bitvalue is 85., compared to only 75 in the interceptresend case. This is possible because in the latter caseEves information is deterministic in half the cases, whilein the first one Eves information is always probabilisticformally this results from the convexity of the entropyfunction.E. Symmetric individual attacksIn this section we present in some details how Evecould get a maximum Shannon information for a fixedQBER, assuming a perfect single qubit source and restricting Eve to attacks on one qubit after the other i.e.individual attacks. The motivation is that this idealized situation is rather easy to treat and nicely illustratesseveral of the subtleties of the subject. Here we concentrate on the BB84 4state protocol, for related results onthe 2state and the 6state protocols see Fuchs and Peres1996 and BechmannPasquinucci and Gisin 1999, respectively.37The general idea of eavesdropping on a quantum channel goes as follows. When a qubit propagates from Alice to Bob, Eve can let a system of her choice, called aprobe, interact with the qubit see Fig. 28. She canfreely choose the probe and its initial state, but it has tobe a system satisfying the quantum rules i.e. describedin some Hilbert space. Eve can also choose the interaction, but it should be independent of the qubit state andshe should follow the laws of quantum mechanics, i.e. herinteraction is described by a unitary operator. After theinteraction a qubit has to go to Bob in section VIH weconsider lossy channels, so that Bob does not always expect a qubit, a fact that Eve can take advantage of. Itmakes no difference whether this qubit is the original onepossibly in a modified state or not. Actually the question does not even make sense since a qubit is nothingbut a qubit But in the formalism it is convenient to usethe same Hilbert space for the qubit sent by Alice andthat received by Bob this is no loss of generality, sincethe swap operator  defined by    for all , is unitary and could be appended to Eves interaction.LetHEve and C2HEve be the Hilbert spaces of Evesprobe and of the total qubitprobe system, respectively.If m, 0 and U denote the qubit and the probes initialstates and the unitary interaction, respectively, then thestate of the qubit received by Bob is given by the densitymatrix obtained by tracing out Eves probeBobm  TrHEveU m, 0m, 0U . 45The symmetry of the BB84 protocol makes it very natural to assume that Bobs state is related to Alices mby a simple shrinking factor50   0, 1 see Fig. 29Bobm 1  m2. 46Eavesdroppings that satisfy the above condition arecalled symmetric attacks.Since the qubit state space is 2dimensional, the unitary operator is entirely determined by its action on twostates, for example the   and   states in this sectionwe use spin 12 notations for the qubits. It is convenientto write the states after the unitary interaction in theSchmidt form Peres 1997U  , 0           4750Chris Fuchs and Asher Peres were the first ones to derivethe result presented in this section, using numerical optimization. Almost simultaneously Robert Griffiths and his student ChiSheng Niu derived it under very general conditionsand Nicolas Gisin using the symmetry argument used here.These 5 authors joined efforts in a common paper Fuchs etal. 1997. The result of this section is thus also valid withoutthis symmetry assumption.U  , 0           48where the 4 states , ,  and  belong to Eves probeHilbert space HEve and satisfy    and   .By symmetry 2  2  F and 2  2  D.Unitarity imposes F D  1 and   0. 49The s correspond to Eves state when Bob gets thequbit undisturbed, while the s are Eves state whenthe qubit is disturbed.Let us emphasize that this is the most general unitaryinteraction satisfying 46. One finds that the shrinkingfactor is given by   F  D. Accordingly, if Alicesends   and Bob measures in the compatible basis,then  Bobm   F is the probability that Bobgets the correct result. Hence F is the fidelity and D theQBER.Note that only 4 states span Eves relevant state space.Hence, Eves effective Hilbert space is at most of dimension 4, no matter how subtle she might be51 This greatlysimplifies the analysis.The symmetry imposes that the attack on the otherbasis satisfiesU  , 0  U  , 0  , 025012         51          52          53where 12       54 12       55Similarly, 12       56 12       57Condition 46 for the  ,   basis implies   and   . By proper choice of the phases, can be made real. By condition 49  isthen also real. Symmetry implies then   .51Actually, Niu and Griffiths 1999 showed that 2dimensional probes suffice for Eve to get as much informationas with the strategy presented here, though in their case theattack is not symmetric one basis is more disturbed than theother.38A straightforward computation concludes that all scalarproducts among Eves states are real and that the sgenerate a subspace orthogonal to the s    0. 58Finally, using 2  F , i.e. that the shrinking is thesame for all states, one obtains a relation between theprobe states overlaps and the fidelityF  1  2  59where the hats denote normalized states, e.g.  D .Consequently, the entire class of symmetric individualattacks depends only on 2 real parameters52 cosx  and cosy  Thanks to the symmetry, it suffices to analyze thisscenario for the case that Alice sends the   state andBob measures in the ,  basis if not, Alice, Bob andEve disregard the data. Since Eve knows the basis, sheknows that her probe is in one of the following two mixedstatesEve  FP  DP  60Eve  FP  DP . 61An optimummeasurement strategy for Eve to distinguishbetween Eve and Eve consists in first distinguishing whether her state is in the subspace generated by and  or the one generated by  and . This is possible, since the two subspaces are mutually orthogonal.Eve has then to distinguish between two pure states, either with overlap cosx, or with overlap cosy. The firstalternative happens with probability F , the second onewith probability D. The optimal measurement distinguishing two states with overlap cosx is known to provide Eve with the correct guess with probability 1sinx2Peres 1997. Eves maximal Shannon information, attained when she does the optimal measurements, is thusgiven byI,   F 1 h1  sinx262 D 1 h1  siny26352Interestingly, when the symmetry is extended to a thirdmaximally conjugated basis, as natural in the 6state protocolof paragraph IID2, then the number of parameters reducesto one. This parameter measures the relative quality of Bobsand Eves copy of the qubit send by Alice. When bothcopies are of equal quality, one recovers the optimal cloningpresented in section II F BechmannPasquinucci and Gisin1999.where hp  p log2p  1 log21  p. For a givenerror rate D, this information is maximal when x  y.Consequently, for D  1cosx2 , one hasImax,   1 h1  sinx2. 64This provides the explicit and analytic optimum eavesdropping strategy. For x  0 the QBER i.e. D andthe information gain are zero. For x  2 the QBERis 12 and the information gain 1. For small QBERs, theinformation gain grows linearlyImax,  2ln2D OD2  2.9 D 65Once Alice, Bob and Eve have measured their quantumsystems, they are left with classical random variables , and , respectively. Secret key agreement between Aliceand Bob is then possible using only error correction andprivacy amplification if and only if the AliceBob mutualShannon information I,  is larger than the AliceEveor the BobEve mutual information53, I,   I, or I,   I, . It is thus interesting to compareEves maximal information 64 with Bobs Shannon information. The latter depends only on the error rate DI,   1 hD 66 1 D log2D  1D log21 D 67Bobs and Eves information are plotted on Fig. 30. Asexpected, for low error rates D, Bobs information islarger. But, more errors provide Eve with more information, while Bobs information gets lower. Hence, bothinformation curves cross at a specific error rate D0I,   Imax,   D  D0 1 122 1568Consequently, the security criteria against individual attacks for the BB84 protocol readsBB84 secure  D  D0 1 12269For QBERs larger than D0 no oneway communication error correction and privacy amplification protocolcan provide Alice and Bob with a secret key immuneagainst any individual attacks.53Note, however, that if this condition is not satisfied, otherprotocols might sometimes be used, see paragraph IIC 5.These protocols are significantly less efficient and are usually not considered as part of standard QC. Note also thatin the scenario analysed in this section I,   I, .39Let us mention that more general classical protocols,called advantage distillation paragraph IIC 5, using twoway communication, exist. These can guarantee secrecyif and only if Eves intervention does not disentangle Alice and Bobs qubits assuming they use the Ekert version of the BB84 protocol Gisin and Wolf 2000. IfEve optimizes her Shannon information, as discussed inthis section, this disentanglementlimit corresponds to aQBER 1  12  30 Gisin and Wolf 1999. But,using more brutal strategies, Eve can disentangled Aliceand Bob already for a QBER of 25, see Fig. 30. Thelatter is thus the absolute upper limit, taking into account the most general secretkey protocols. In practice,the limit 68 is more realistic, since advantage distillation algorithms are much less efficient than the classicalprivacy amplification ones.F. Connection to Bell inequalityThere is an intriguing connection between the abovetight bound 69 and the CHSH form of Bell inequalityBell 1964, Clauser et al. 1969, Clauser and Shimony1978, Zeilinger 1999S  Ea, b  Ea, b  Ea, b Ea, b  2 70where Ea, b is the correlation between Alice and Bobsdata when measuring a1 and 1b, where a denotesan observable with eigenvalues 1 parameterized by thelabel a. Recall that Bell inequalities are necessarily satisfied by all local models, but are violated by quantummechanics54. To establish this connection, assume thatthe same quantum channel is used to test Bell inequality.It is wellknown that for error free channels, a maximalviolation by a factor2 is achievable Smax  22  2.However, if the channel is imperfect, or equivalently ifsome perturbator Eve acts on the channel, then the quantum correlation Ea, bD is reduced,Ea, bD  F Ea, bD  Ea, b 71 1 2D  Ea, b 72where Ea, b denote the correlation for the unperturbedchannel. The achievable amount of violation is then reduced to SmaxD  1  2D22 and for large perturbations no violation at all can be achieved. Interestingly,the critical perturbation D up to which a violation canbe observed is precisely the same D0 as the limit derivedin the previous section for the security of the BB84 protocol54Let us stress that the CHSHBell inequality is the strongestpossible for two qubits. Indeed, this inequality is violated ifand only if the correlation cant be reproduced by a localhidden variable model Pitowski 1989.SmaxD  2  D  D0 1 122. 73This is a surprising and appealing connection betweenthe security of QC and tests of quantum nonlocality.One could argue that this connection is quite natural,since, if Bell inequality were not violated, then quantummechanics would be incomplete and no secure communication could be based on such an incomplete theory.In some sense, Eves information is like probabilistic local hidden variables. However, the connection between69 and 73 has not been generalized to other protocols.A complete picture of these connections is thus not yetavailable.Let us emphasize that nonlocality plays no direct rolein QC. Indeed, generally, Alice is in the absolute pastof Bob. Nevertheless, Bell inequality can be violated aswell by space like separated events as by time like separated events. However, the independence assumptionnecessary to derive Bell inequality is justified by localityconsiderations only for spacelike separated events.G. Ultimate security proofsThe security proof of QC with perfect apparatuses anda noisefree channel is straightforward. However, the factthat security can still be proven for imperfect apparatusesand noisy channels is far from obvious. Clearly, something has to be assumed about the apparatuses. In thissection we simply make the hypothesis that they are perfect. For the channel which is not under Alice and Bobscontrol, however, nothing is assumed. The question isthen up to which QBER can Alice and Bob apply error correction and privacy amplification to their classicalbits In the previous sections we found that the thresholdis close to a QBER of 15, assuming individual attacks.But in principle Eve could manipulate several qubits coherently. How much help to Eve this possibility providesis still unknown, though some bounds are known. Already in 1996, Dominic Mayers 1996b presented themain ideas on how to prove security55. In 1998, two major papers were made public on the Los Alamos archivesMayers 1998, and Lo and Chau 1999. Nowadays, theseproofs are generally considered as valid, thanks  among55I NG vividly remember the 1996 ISI workshop in Torino,sponsored by ElsagBailey, were I ended my talk stressing theimportance of security proofs. Dominic Mayers stood up, gavesome explanation, and wrote a formula on a transparency,claiming that this was the result of his proof. I think it isfair to say that no one in the audience understood Mayersexplanation. But I kept the transparency and it contains thebasic eq. 76 up to a factor 2, which corresponds to animprovement of Mayers result obtained in 2000 by Shor andPreskill, using also ideas from Lo and Chau40others  to the works of P. Shor and J. Preskill 2000,H. Inamori et al. 2001 and of E. Biham et al. 1999.But it is worth noting that during the first years afterthe first disclosure of these proofs, essentially nobody inthe community understood themHere we shall present the argument in a form quitedifferent from the original proofs. Our presentation aimsat being transparent in the sense that it rests on twotheorems. The proofs of the theorems are hard and willbe omitted. However, their claims are easy to understandand rather intuitive. Once one accepts the theorems, thesecurity proof is rather straightforward.The general idea is that at some point Alice, Bob andEve perform measurements on their quantum systems.The outcomes provide them with classical random variables ,  and , respectively, with P , ,  the jointprobability distribution. The first theorem, a standardof classical information based cryptography, states necessary and sufficient condition on P , ,  for the possibility that Alice and Bob extract a secret key fromP , ,  Csiszar and Korner 1978. The second theorem is a clever version of Heisenbergs uncertainty relation expressed in terms of available information Hall1995 it sets a bound on the sum of the informationavailable to Bob and to Eve on Alices key.Theorem 1. For a given P , , , Alice and Bobcan establish a secret key using only error correction and classical privacy amplification if and only ifI,   I,  or I,   I, , where I,  HH denotes the mutual information, with Hthe Shannon entropy.Theorem 2. Let E and B be two observables in an Ndimensional Hilbert space. Denote , ,  and  thecorresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, respectively,and let c  max,. ThenI,   I,   2 log2Nc, 74where I,   H  H and I,   H H are the entropy differences corresponding to theprobability distribution of the eigenvalues  prior to anddeduced from any measurement by Eve and Bob, respectively.The first theorem states that Bob must have more information on Alices bits than Eve see Fig. 31. Sinceerror correction and privacy amplification can be implemented using only 1way communication, theorem 1 canbe understood intuitively as follows. The initial situation is depicted in a. During the public phase of theprotocol, because of the 1way communication, Eve receives as much information as Bob, the initial informationdifference  thus remains. After error correction, Bobsinformation equals 1, as illustrated on b. After privacyamplification Eves information is zero. In c Bob has replaced all bits to be disregarded by random bits. Hencethe key has still the original length, but his informationhas decreased. Finally, removing the random bits, thekey is shortened to the initial information difference, seed. Bob has full information on this final key, while Evehas none.The second theorem states that if Eve performs a measurement providing her with some information I, ,then, because of the perturbation, Bobs information isnecessarily limited. Using these two theorems, the argument now runs as follows. Suppose Alice sends outa large number of qubits and that n where received byBob in the correct basis. The relevant Hilbert spacesdimension is thus N  2n. Let us relabel the bases usedfor each of the n qubits such that Alice used n timesthe xbasis. Hence, Bobs observable is the ntime tensor product x  ...  x. By symmetry, Eves optimalinformation on the correct bases is precisely the same asher optimal information on the incorrect ones Mayers1998. Hence one can bound her information assumingshe measures z  ...  z . Accordingly, c  2n2 andtheorem 2 impliesI,   I,   2 log22n2n2  n 75That is, the sum of Eves and Bobs information perqubit is smaller or equal to 1. This is quite an intuitive result together, Eve and Bob cannot get moreinformation than sent out by Alice Next, combiningthe bound 75 with theorem 1, one deduces that a secret key is achievable whenever I,   n2. UsingI,   n 1D log2D 1 D log21D oneobtains the sufficient condition on the error rate D i.e.the QBERD log2D  1D log21D 1276i.e. D  11.This bound, QBER11, is precisely that obtainedin Mayers proof after improvement by P. Shor and J.Preskill 2000. The above proof is, strickly speaking,only valid if the key is much longer than the number ofqubits that Eve attacks coherently, so that the Shannoninformations we used represent averages over many independent realisations of classical random variables. Inother words, assuming that Eve can attack coherently alarge but finite number n0 of qubits, Alice and Bob canuse the above proof to secure keys much longer than n0bits. If one assumes that Eve has an unlimited power,able to attack coherently any number of qubits, then theabove proof does not apply, but Mayers proof can stillbe used and provides precisely the same bound.This 11 bound for coherent attacks is clearly compatible with the 15 bound found for individual attacks.The 15 bound is also a necessary one, since an expliciteavesdropping strategy reaching this bound is presentedin section VIE. It is not known what happens in theintermediate range 11  QBER  15, but the following is plausible. If Eve is limited to coherent attackson a finite number of qubits, then in the limit of arbitrarily long keys, she has a negligibly small probabilitythat the bits combined by Alice and Bob during the error41correction and privacy amplification protocols originatefrom qubits attacked coherently. Consequently, the 15bound would still be valid partial results in favor of thisconjecture can be found in Cirac and Gisin 1997, andin BechmannPasquinucci and Gisin 1999. However, ifEve has unlimited power, in particular, if she can coherently attack an unlimited number of qubits, then the 11bound might be required.To conclude this section, let us stress that the abovesecurity proof equally applies to the 6state protocolparagraph IID 2. It also extends straightforwardly toprotocols using larger alphabets BechmannPasquinucciand Tittel 2000, BechmannPasquinucci and Peres 2000,Bourennane et al. 2001a, Bourennane et al. 2001b.H. Photon number measurements, lossless channelsIn section III A we saw that all real photon sourceshave a finite probability to emit more than 1 photon. Ifall emitted photons encode the same qubit, Eve can takeadvantage of this. In principle, she can first measurethe number of photons in each pulse, without disturbingthe degree of freedom encoding the qubits56. Such measurements are sometimes called Quantum Non Demolition QND measurements, because they do not perturbthe qubit, in particular they do not destroy the photons.This is possible because Eve knows in advance that Alice sends a mixture of states with well defined photonnumbers57, see section II F. Next, if Eve finds morethan one photon, she keeps one and sends the othersto Bob. In order to prevent that Bob detects a lowerqubit rate, Eve must use a channel with lower losses. Using an ideally lossless quantum channel, Eve can even,under certain conditions, keep one photon and increasethe probability that pulses with more than one photonget to Bob Thirdly, when Eve finds one photon, shemay destroy it with a certain probability, such that shedoes not affect the total number of qubits received byBob. Consequently, if the probability that a nonemptypulse has more than one photon on Alices side is largerthan the probability that a nonempty pulse is detected56For polarization coding, this is quite clear. But for phasecoding one may think incorrectly that phase and photonnumber are incompatible However, the phase used for encoding is a relative phase between two modes. Whether thesemodes are polarization modes or correspond to different timesdetermined e.g. by the relative length of interferometers,does not matter.57Recall that a mixture of coherent states ei with arandom phase , as produced by lasers when no phase reference in available, is equal to a mixture of photon number states n with Poisson statistics20eiei d2n0nnenn, where   2.by Bob, then Eve can get full information without introducing any perturbation This is possible only when theQC protocol is not perfectly implemented, but this is arealistic situation Huttner et al. 1995, Yuen 1997.The QND atacks have recently received a lot of attention Lutkenhaus 2000, Brassard et al. 2000. Thedebate is not yet settled. We would like to argue thatit might be unrealistic, or even unphysical, to assumethat Eve can perform ideal QND attacks. Indeed, firstshe needs the capacity to perform QND photon numbermeasurements. Although impossible with todays technology, this is a reasonable assumption Nogues et al.1999. Next, she should be able to keep her photon untilAlice and Bob reveal the basis. In principle this couldbe achieved using a lossless channel in a loop. We discuss this eventuality below. Another possibility wouldbe that Eve maps her photon to a quantum memory.This does not exist today, but might well exist in thefuture. Note that the quantum memory should have essentially unlimited time, since Alice and Bob could easilywait for minutes before revealing the bases58. Finally,Eve must access a lossless channel, or at least a channel with losses lower than that used by Alice and Bob.This might be the most tricky point. Indeed, besidesusing a shorter channel, what can Eve do The telecom fibers are already at the physical limits of what canbe achieved Thomas et al. 2000. The loss is almostentirely due to the Rayleigh scattering which is unavoidable solve the Schrodinger equation in a medium withinhomogeneities and you get scattering. And when theinhomogeneities are due to the molecular stucture of themedium, it is difficult to imagine lossless fibers The 0.18dBkm attenuation in silica fibers at 1550 nm is a lowerbound which is based on physics, not on technology59.Note that using the air is not a viable solution, since theattenuation at the telecom wavelengths is rather high.Vacuum, the only way to avoid Rayleigh scattering, hasalso limitations, due to diffraction, again an unavoidablephysical phenomenon. In the end, it seems that Eve hasonly two possibilities left. Either she uses teleportationwith extremely high success probability and fidelity or58The quantum part of the protocol could run continuously,storing large ammount of raw classical data. But the classicalpart of the protocol, processing these raw data, could takeplace just seconds before the key is used.59Photonics crystal fibers have the potential to overcomethe Rayleigh scaterring limit. Actually, there are two kindsof such fibers. The first kind guides light by total internalreflection, like in ordinary fibers. In these most of the lightalso propagates in silica, and thus the loss limit is similar. Inthe second kind, most of the light propagates in air, thus thetheoretical loss limit is lower. However, today the losses areextremely high, in the range of hundreds of dBkm. The bestreported result that we are aware of is 11 dBkm and it wasobtained with a fiber of the first kind Canning et al. 2000.42she converts the photons to another wavelength without perturbing the qubit. Both of these solutions areseemingly unrealistic in any foreseeable future.Consequently, when considering the type of attacksdiscussed in this section, it is essential to distinguish theultimate proofs from the practical ones discussed in thefirst part of this chapter. Indeed, the assumptions aboutthe defects of Alice and Bobs apparatuses must be veryspecific and might thus be of limited interest. While forpractical considerations, these assumptions must be verygeneral and might thus be excessive.I. A realistic beamsplitter attackThe attack presented in the previous section takes advantage of the pulses containing more than one photon.However, as discussed, it uses unrealistic assumptions.In this section, following N. Lutkenhaus 2000 and M.Dusek et al 2000, we briefly comment on a realistic attack, also exploiting the multiphoton pulses for details,see Felix et al. 2001, where this and another examplesare presented. Assume that Eve splits all pulses in two,analysing each half in one of the two bases, using photon counting devices able to distinguish pulses with 0,1 and 2 photons see Fig. 32. In practice this couldbe realized using many single photon counters in parallel. This requires nearly perfect detectors, but at leastone does not need to assume technology completely outof todays realm. Whenever Eve detects two photonsin the same output, she sends a photon in the corresponding state into Bobs apparatus. Since Eves information is classical, she can overcome all the losses of thequantum channel. In all other cases, Eve sends nothing to Bob. In this way, Eve sends a fraction 38 of thepulses containing at least 2 photons to Bob. On these,she introduces a QBER16 and gets an informationIA,E  23  4  QBER. Bob doesnt see any reduction in the number of detected photons, provided thetransmission coefficient of the quantum channel t satisfiest  38Probn  2n  1  31677where the last expression assumes Poissonian photon distribution. Accordingly, for a fixed QBER, this attacksprovides Eve with twice the information she would getusing the intercept resend strategy. To counter such anattack, Alice should use a mean photon number  suchthat Eve can only use this attack on a fraction of thepulses. For example, Alice could use pulses weak enoughthat Eves mean information gain is identical to the oneshe would obtain with the simple intercept resend strategy see paragraph IIC 3. For 10, 14 and 20 dB attenuation, this corresponds to   0.25, 0.1 and 0.025,respectively.J. Multiphoton pulses and passive choice of statesMultiphoton pulses do not necessarily constitute athreat for the key security, but limit the key creationrate because they imply that more bits must be discardedduring key distillation. This fact is based on the assumption that all photons in a pulse carry the same qubit, sothat Eve does not need to copy the qubit going to Bob,but merely keeps the copy that Alice inadvertently provides. When using weak pulses, it seems unavoidablethat all the photons in a pulse carry the same qubit.However, in 2photon implementations, each photon onAlices side chooses independently a state in the experiments of Ribordy et al. 2001 and Tittel et al. 2000, eachphoton chooses randomly both its basis and its bit valuein the experiments of Naik et al. 2000 and Jennewein etal. 2000b, the bit value choice only is random. Hence,when two photon pairs are simultaneously produced, byaccident, the two twins carry independent qubits. Consequently, Eve cant take advantage of such multiphotontwinpulses. This might be one of the main advantagesof the 2photon schemes compared to the much simplerweakpulse schemes. But the multiphoton problem isthen on Bobs side who gets a noisy signal, consistingpartly in photons not in Alices stateK. Trojan Horse AttacksAll eavesdropping strategies discussed up to now consisted of Eves attempt to get a maximum informationout of the qubits exchanged by Alice and Bob. But Evecan also follow a completely different strategy she canherself send signals that enter Alice and Bobs officesthrough the quantum channel. This kind of strategiesare called Trojan horse attacks. For example, Eve cansend light pulses into the fiber entering Alice or Bob apparatuses and analyze the backreflected light. In thisway, it is in principle possible to detect which laser justflashed, or which detector just fired, or the settings ofphase and polarization modulators. This cannot be simply prevented by using a shutter, since Alice and Bobmust leave the door open for the photons to go outand in, respectively.In most QCsetups the amount of backreflected lightcan be made very small and sensing the apparatuses withlight pulses through the quantum channel is difficult.Nevertheless, this attack is especially threatening in theplugplay scheme on Alices side section IVC2, sincea mirror is used to send the light pulses back to Bob.So in principle, Eve can send strong light pulses to Aliceand sense the applied phase shift. However, by applyingthe phase shift only during a short time tphasea fewnanoseconds, Alice can oblige Eve to send the spyingpulse at the same time as Bob. Remember that in theplugplay scheme pulse coming from Bob are macroscopic and an attenuator at Alice reduces them to the43below one photon level, say 0.1 photons per pulse. Hence,if Eve wants to get, say 1 photon per pulse, she has tosend 10 times Bobs pulse energy. Since Alice is detecting Bobs pulses for triggering her apparatus, she mustbe able to detect an increase of energy of these pulsesin order to reveal the presence of a spying pulse. Thisis a relatively easy task, provided that Eves pulses lookthe same as Bobs. But, Eve could of course use anotherwavelength or ultrashort pulses or very long pulses withlow intensity, hence the importance of tphase, therefore Alice must introduce an optical bandpass filter witha transmission spectrum corresponding to the sensitivityspectrum of her detector, and choose a tphase that fitsto the bandwidth of her detector.There is no doubt that Trojan horse attacks can beprevented by technical measures. However, the fact thatthis class of attacks exist illustrates that the security ofQC can never be guaranteed only by the principles ofquantum mechanics, but necessarily relies also on technical measures that are subject to discussions 60.L. Real security technology, cost and complexityDespite the elegant and generality of security proofs,the dream of a QC system whose security relies entirelyon quantum principles is unrealistic. The technologicalimplementation of the abstract principles will always bequestionable. It is likely that they will remain the weakest point in all systems. Moreover, one should rememberthe obvious equationInfinite security  Infinite cost 78 Zero practical interestOn the other hand, however, one should not underestimate the following two advantages of QC. First, itis much easier to forecast progress in technology than inmathematics the danger that QC breaks down overnightis negligible, contrary to publickey cryptosystems. Next,the security of QC depends on the technological level ofthe adversary at the time of the key exchange, contraryto complexity based systems whose coded message canbe registered and broken thanks to future progress. Thelatter point is relevant for secrets whose value last manyyears.One often points at the low bit rate as one of the current limitations of QC. However, it is important to stressthat QC must not necessarily be used in conjunction withonetime pad encryption. It can also be used to providea key for a symmetrical cipher  such as AES  whosesecurity is greatly enhanced by frequent key changes.60Another technological loophole, recently pointed out byKurtsiefer et al., is the possible information leakage causedby light emitted by APDs during their breakdown 2001.To conclude this chapter, let us briefly elaborate onthe differences and similarities between technological andmathematical complexity and on their possible connections and implications. Mathematical complexity meansthat the number of steps needed to run complex algorithms explodes exponentially when the size of the inputdata grows linearly. Similarly, one can define technological complexity of a quantum computer by an explodingdifficulty to process coherently all the qubits necessaryto run a noncomplex algorithm on a linearly growingnumber of input data. It might be interesting to consider the possibility that the relation between these twoconcepts of complexity is deeper. It could be that thesolution of a problem requires either a complex classical algorithm or a quantum one which itself requires acomplex quantum computer61.VII. CONCLUSIONQuantum cryptography is a fascinating illustration ofthe dialog between basic and applied physics. It is basedon a beautiful combinations of concepts from quantumphysics and information theory and made possible thanksto the tremendous progress in quantum optics and in thetechnology of optical fibers and of free space optical communication. Its security principle relies on deep theoremsin classical information theory and on a profound understanding of the Heisenbergs uncertainty principle, as illustrated by theorems 1 and 2 in section VIG the onlymathematically involved theorems in this review. Letus also emphasize the important contributions of QC toclassical cryptography privacy amplification and classical bound information paragraphs II C 4 and II C5 areexamples of concepts in classical information whose discovery were much inspired by QC. Moreover, the fascinating tension between quantum physics and relativity,as illustrated by Bells inequality, is not far away, as discussed in section VIF. Now, despite the huge progressover the recent years, many open questions and technological challenges remain.One technological challenge at present concerns improved detectors compatible with telecom fibers. Twoother issues concern free space QC and quantum repeaters. The first is presently the only way to realizeQC over thousands of kilometers using near future technology see section IVE. The idea of quantum repeaterssection III E is to encode the qubits in such a way that ifthe error rate is low, then errors can be detected and corrected entirely in the quantum domain. The hope is that61Penrose 1994 pushes these speculations even further,suggesting that spontaneous collapses stop quantum computers whenever they try to compute beyond a certaincomplexity.44such techniques could extend the range of quantum communication to essentially unlimited distances. Indeed,Hans Briegel, then at Innsbruck University 1998, andcoworkers, showed that the number of additional qubitsneeded for quantum repeaters can be made smaller thanthe numbers of qubits needed to improved the fidelity ofthe quantum channel Dur et al. 1999. One could thusovercome the decoherence problem. However, the mainpractical limitation is not decoherence but loss mostphotons never get to Bob, but those which get there,exhibit high fidelity.On the open questions side, let us emphasize threemain concerns. First, complete and realistic analysesof the security issues are still missing. Next, figures ofmerit to compare QC schemes based on different quantum systems with different dimensions for example arestill awaited. Finally, the delicate question of how totest the apparatuses did not yet receive enough attention. Indeed, a potential customer of quantum cryptography buys confidence and secrecy, two qualities hard toquantify. Interestingly, both of these issues have a connection with Bell inequality see sections VIF and VIB.But, clearly, this connection can not be phrased in the oldcontext of local hidden variables, but rather in the context of the security of tomorrows communications. Here,like in all the field of quantum information, old conceptsare renewed by looking at them from a fresh perspectivelets exploit the quantum weirdnessQC could well be the first application of quantum mechanics at the single quanta level. Experiments havedemonstrated that keys can be exchanged over distancesof a few tens of kilometers at rates at least of the orderof a thousand bits per second. There is no doubt thatthe technology can be mastered and the question is notwhether QC will find commercial applications, but when.Indeed, presently QC is still very limited in distance andin secretbit rate. Moreover, public key systems occupythe market and, being pure software, are tremendouslyeasier to manage. Every so often, the news is that someclassical ciphersystem has been broken. This would beimpossible with properly implemented QC. But this apparent strength of QC might turn out to be its weakpoint the security agencies would equally be unable tobreak quantum cryptogramsACKNOWLEDGMENTSWork supported by the Swiss FNRS and the Europeanprojects EQCSPOT and QUCOMM financed by the SwissOFES.

Eavesdropping on a quantum channel. Eve extracts information out of the quantum channel between Aliceand Bob at the cost of introducing noise into that channel.FIG. 29. Poincare representation of the BB84 states in theevent of a symmetrical attack. The state received by Bob afterthe interaction of Eves probe is related to the one sent byAlice by a simple shrinking factor.

Eve and Bob information versus the QBER, hereplotted for incoherent eavesdropping on the 4state protocol.For QBERs below QBER0, Bob has more information thanEve and secretkey agreement can be achieved using classicalerror correction and privacy amplification. These can, in principle, be implemented using only 1way communication. Thesecretkey rate can be as large as the information differences.For QBERs above QBER0  D0, Bob has a disadvantagewith respect to Eve. Nevertheless, Alice and Bob can applyquantum privacy amplification up to the QBER corresponding to the interceptresend eavesdropping strategies, IR4 andIR6 for the 4state and 6state protocols, respectively. Alternatively, they can apply a classical protocol called advantagedistillation which is effective precisely up to the same maximal QBER IR4 and IR6. Both the quantum and the classicalprotocols require then 2way communication. Note that forthe eavesdropping strategy optimal from Eve Shannon pointof view on the 4state protocol, QBER0 correspond preciselyto the noise threshold above which a Bell inequality can nolonger be violated.56FIG. 31. Intuitive illustration of theorem 1. The initialsituation is depicted in a. During the 1way public discussionphase of the protocol Eve receives as much information asBob, the initial information difference  thus remains. Aftererror correction, Bobs information equals 1, as illustrated onb. After privacy amplification Eves information is zero. Inc Bob has replaced all bits to be disregarded by random bits.Hence the key has still the original length, but his informationhas decreased. Finally, removing the random bits, the key isshortened to the initial information difference, see d. Bobhas full information on this final key, while Eve has none.FIG. 32. Realistic beamsplitter attack. Eve stops allpulses. The two photon pulses have a 50 probability tobe analyzed by the same analyzer. If this analyzer is compatible with the state prepared by Alice, then both photon aredetected at the same outcome if not there is a 50 chancethat they are detected at the same outcome. Hence, thereis a probability of 38 that Eve detects both photons at thesame outcome. In such a case, and only in such a case, sheresends a photon to Bob. In 23 of these cases she introducesno errors since she identified the correct state and gets fullinformation in the remaining cases she has a probability 12to introduce an error and gains no information. The totalQBER is thus 16 and Eves information gain 23.57
