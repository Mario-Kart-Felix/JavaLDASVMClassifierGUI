Offshore outsourcing has been seen as one solution to the dilemma, and lucrative outsourcing businesses have evolved in many countries. Vietnam is now emerging within this global outsourcing sector. This study conducts an indepth literature review and analyzes a number of important issues related to developing countries in general and Vietnam in particular, as an offshore outsourcing destination for Finnish companies for developing their software. From the analysis, an integrative conceptual model of software development through offshore outsourcing was developed. The study found challenges as well as potential in Vietnams software outsourcing industry. In addition, it provides valuable information for practitioners interested in outsourcing to Vietnam and for further research within the area.  INTRODUCTION Offshore software development has become a rapidly growing practice in the information technology IT industry. Rationale for outsourcing varies from financial aspects, renewing management agenda and focusing on core competencies, to technical and political reasons Lacity  Willcocks, 2001 Sparrow, 2003 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009 Nahar, 2010. The financial aspects are reducing costs, generating cash, and replacing capital outlays with periodic payments. Technical motives are improving quality, gaining access to new talent and technology, and availability of service providers with expertise and economies of scale. Political reasons deal with dissatisfaction with internal departments and managers, viewing IT as a support function rather than a key asset, and pressure from service providers, as well as a desire to follow trends receiving attention in trade journals and press Smith et al., 1998. Development of online databases, collaborative online and other tools, different sourcing strategies and cooperation models develop many opportunities for companies to effectively and precisely executing outsourcing projects. Hoch et al. 2000 addressed that even though there is high potential for attaining wealth and profits in the software business, only a few companies have succeeded to remain in the market and flourish.  Today offshore outsourcing is more a norm rather than a specialty. Nevertheless, implementing a successful offshore outsourcing project is not an easy task. In addition to the traditional risks software projects face, such as organizational, technical and communication, offshore Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 40 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy outsourcing projects require more attention on managerial and cultural aspects Beulen  Ribbers, 2002 Narayanaswamy  Henry, 2005 Wei  Peach, 2006 Yalaho  Nahar, 2008. Vast distances between software development centres, cultural aspects and barriers emphasize the need for offshore outsourcing projects to be well managed. Time zone differences also magnify the requirement for managing offshore outsourcing projects successfully.  Carmel 2003a developed a 4tier taxonomy of software exporting nations classifying the software industry. In this categorization, Vietnam resided in the last tier of Infant stage software exporting nations. The characteristics of this tier are under five years of maturity, under 100 organizations and companies, and export revenues between US25 million and US100 million. Along with Vietnam, fourth tier nations include Cuba, Egypt, Indonesia and Bangladesh. These nations face challenges related to infrastructure, cultural and sociopolitical issues, and partner preconceptions Heeks, 1999 Coward, 2003. The top tier consists of organization for economic cooperation and development OECD countries, such as the United States US, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Finland and the new comer of the 1990s, India. These countries have a software export maturity of over 15 years, hundreds of organizations and significantly over US1 billion of export revenues Carmel, 2003a. Indian ITBPO industry attained aggregate returns of US71.6 billion in 2009. Of this, the software and services segment accounted for US59.6 billion. As per NASSCOM, the Indian IT exports are anticipated to attain US175 billion by 2020 out of which the domestic sector will account for US50 billion in earnings. India continues to be the most favoured destination for companies looking to offshore their IT and backoffice functions India Business Dictionary, 2010. Currently, Vietnam Software Association VINASA has 198 members and it intends to increase its membership base to 500 companies by 2015 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010a. FPT Software and TMA Solutions, two of the member companies of VINASA have had outsourcing experience since 1999 FPT Software, 2006. The revenue of FPT Software in the first quarter of 2010 was approximately US12 million FPT Software, 2010. Vietnam is making an impressive progress in offshore outsourcing and has the potential of becoming a significant player in the global software market in the future.  Nearly 90 million inhabitants Excel Brothers Inc., 2010 make Vietnam the 13th most populous country in the world Wikipedia, 2009. The advantage of big population is the prospect of a large skill pool. In fact, today Vietnam outputs 15,000 information and communication technology ICT masters and engineers from local universities and another 10,000 ICT college graduates annually Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010b.  The success of Indias IT industry, especially software and services sectors have fuelled other Asian countries to develop their assets as they seek to improve economic growth and general quality of life. India is the most dominant country in Asia. Its success has been built on strong government involvement, large skill pools, proficiency in the English language, and a focus on quality improvement, assurance, quality and process certificates. Therefore, these incentives have helped it to become a dominant player in the IT business Cusumano, 2006 Eischen, 2003 NASSCOM, 2008. The success of India has inspired other Asian countries to develop their software and IT industries and Vietnam is no exception.  An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 41 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy The governments strong support, such as tax incentives, infrastructure development, low labour costs and potential skill pools Dzung, 2008 Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004 Nguyen, 2004 could, for example, enhance Vietnams competitive advantage as they did for India a decade before. These programs and the low cost environment have attracted many major foreign multinational companies to invest in Vietnam. Even the major Indian IT companies, whose success and growth have come from providing outsourcing services, have decided to expand and create joint ventures and offices in Vietnam Vietnam Software Association, 2006.   Finland, in contrast, is one of the leading countries in the technological world. It is technologically a highly developed country and is regarded as a location for increasing technological knowledge and expertise. The software industry is one of Finlands most important industry sectors. Despite investing larger share of GDP into developing the software industry, the internationally successful Finnish software companies are still few in number. The size of the industry was about 3.06 billion Euros at the end of 2009, while it was 3.09 billion Euros in 2008. There are currently more than 1000 software companies in Finland. In 2009, there were only seven Finnish software companies among the top 100 European software vendors. Revenues are relatively low when compared to top countries. Most companies are small or medium sized, i.e. one third employs fewer than five professionals. There are about 33,00048,000 people working in software development in Finland, however of which most likely more than half are working outside the software industry Ronkko et al., 2010. Finnish software companies financial structure is rather conservative with little debt or outside funding Lassila et al., 2006. Although it is reliable, the lack of venture capital can hinder swift growth and internationalization.   As a software development outsourcing destination, Vietnam has not been widely researched by the academic community. This research was conducted to find out the possibilities that can be offered to Finnish companies by Vietnam and Vietnamese software outsourcing service providers. Limited research exists on the subject of Vietnamese software outsourcing and almost no research has been done from the Finnish software companies perspective. Hence, there is a research gap that requires further investigation. The main research question of this study is How can Vietnamese outsourcing service providers serve Finnish software outsourcers This study conducts an indepth literature review and analyzes a number of important issues related to this research problem see the literature review section. Through an extensive literature review we also find out the current state of Vietnamese software companies, earlier experiences of Finnish companies engagements with offshore outsourcing, and practical and special issues involved with Vietnam and Vietnamese service providing companies. From the analysis, an integrative conceptual model of software development through offshore outsourcing is developed.  The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows a research method and literature review on Vietnam as an offshore outsourcing destination for Finnish companies for developing their software products are conducted first. Based on the literature review an integrative conceptual model of offshore outsourcing of software development to developing countries i.e. Vietnam is developed. Finally, conclusions and implications are discussed, and future research direction is suggested.     Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L.

This study evaluated a representative sample of research published in journals, books, conference proceedings, etc. dealing with a offshore outsourcing, b offshore software development, c IT industry in developing countries, especially in Vietnam, d approaches for IT outsourcing to developing countries and to Vietnam, and e Finnish outsourcing service users.  Several methods of locating published materials were used. We searched the databases, such as EBSCO, EEBO, Linda, Nelli, ScienceDirect, Emerald, ACM, and JSTOR using a combination of the following keywords offshore outsourcing, offshore software development outsourcing, offshore software development outsourcing process, IT industry in Vietnam and China, factors affecting IT industry success in developing countries, advantages of developing countries IT outsourcing service providersvendors, challenges of developing countries IT outsourcing service providersvendors, Vietnamese IT service providersvendors, advantages of Vietnamese software outsourcing service providersvendors, challenges of Vietnamese software outsourcing service providersvendors, Finnish IT outsourcing service usersoutsourcing companies, Finnish companies IT outsourcing engagement with Vietnamese software service providers, types of IT outsourcing to developing countries, business models and pricing models for IT outsourcing to Vietnam, Vietnam as an offshore outsourcing destination, to name a few. In addition, we reviewed some books and proceedings that were not included in the databases mentioned above. Through the abovementioned processes the relevant materials were collected.  Abstracts and conclusions were reviewed quickly those unrelated to the research problem and objectives were rejected. We learnt that a great deal of research has been done on offshore outsourcing in general, but very limited research has been done on the subject of software development outsourcing to Vietnam and almost no research has been done from the Finnish software companies perspective. After a preliminary reading, some additional papers that seemed not to be related to our research, were omitted. The rest of the papers were thoroughly read and we identified related information regarding our research problem, research objectives, and thoughtsideas for this study. As part of the analysis, these papers were used as references in developing the conceptual model for offshore outsourcing of software development to developing countries i.e. Vietnam.

Vietnam as an offshore outsourcing destination Vietnams IT Industry has experienced a vast development recently. Software sales revenue saw a fourfold increase from US250 million in 2005 to 680 million in 2008 and 850 million in 2009. Revenue was expected to exceed 1billion by the yearend Vietnam Business and Economy News, 2010. Vietnams IT market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 12 over the 20102014 period. The domestic market for IT products and services is projected to reach US1.9 billion in 2010 and US2.9 billion by 2014 Business Monitor International, 2010a. Vietnams software market is developing swiftly and is offering a good investment potential for foreign companies. VINASA is the leading nongovernmental organization of Vietnamese software companies and is an equivalent of Indias NASSCOM. It has 198 member companies, contributing 70 of the IT industrys total revenue and employing 60 of the industrys total employees. Over the past several years, it has helped its member companies improve their presence in the local market by connecting with international IT businesses, expanding export outlets, establishing trademarks, and developing human resources Vietnam Business and Economy News, 2010. In addition, an impressive list of foreign companies have entered Vietnam, such as Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Cisco Systems, Accenture, Apple, Oracle, HewlettPackard, AlcatelLucent, Acer, Sony, Hitachi, Sanyo, Bayer, BMG, more than 20 Danish companies, and so on.  According to Business Monitor International 2010a, there are around 10,000 firms currently licensed to provide IT services, but only onethird are actually operating in Vietnam. Another study shows that there are approximately 4,000 ICT companies and around 460,000 employees working in the ICT sector in Vietnam. Most of the software companies are small over 80 of these employs under 50 professionals and there are about 20 companies with more than 100500 employees. There are also some companies with more than 1,000 employees, such as FPT software, FPT Information Systems, TMA Solutions, PSV, etc. Of the 460,000 employed in the ICT sector, 90,000 are in the software and digital content sector Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010b. However, over the last few years, the Vietnamese software and IT services companies are enjoying significant development in size, quality and quantity. The number of fixed telephone and mobile subscribers was over 30 million in 2006 Ministry of Posts  Telematics, 2006 and 115.7 million in 2009 Smith, 2010. In addition, the number of internet users has grown from 12 million in 2006 HoChiMinh Computer Association, 2006 to 24.7 million in 2009 Smith, 2010. Strong domestic demand has built a solid foundation for domestic industries to develop and evolve. The government has also become aware of the impact IT can make to economic development and has considered IT as a driving force for economic and social progress. To promote and enhance IT industry and especially the software industry, the state has issued several policies that aim to Nguyen, 2004 Jenkins, 2004 a set up a favourable investment environment, b expand An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 45 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy the market, c develop human resources, d protect copyrights, and e create favourable telecommunication infrastructures. For Vietnamese software companies, these policies are concretized by Athukorala, 2006 Auffret, 2003 Nguyen, 2004 a a four year exemption from income tax from the first year a company has a taxable income, b preferential income taxation for software industry staff, c 0 Value Added Tax for software products and services, d 0 import tax for materials directly used for software production, e 0 export tax for software products, f subsidized internet connection fees for companies operating in software parks, and g exemption for all local and foreign software companies, or have diminished land tax and costs of using and renting land. However, Vietnamese ICT policies are too broad and too many. The Vietnamese Government allowed 22 agencies to regulate different facets of ICT, thus confounding the users and impeding progress Information and Communication Technology in Vietnam, 2003. The domestic ICT market growth is severely hindered by poor intellectual property protection. Business Software Alliance 2006 stated that piracy rate in Vietnam was the highest 90 in the world in 2005 and an estimated US38 million was lost due to pirated software. In 2009, software piracy rate was over 85 in Vietnam Excel Brothers Inc., 2010. In respect of the above mentioned current statistical data, it can be seen that Vietnam is already in Tier 3 of Carmels 2003a software exporting nations taxonomy. Carmel defined the thresholds for Tier 3 as emerging software exporting nations over five years of maturity critical mass of organizations in tens and export revenues over US25 million. As mentioned earlier, companies such as FPT Software and TMA Solutions have outsourcing experience since 1999. Besides, there are many other outsourcing service providers who are serving international clients and new ones are rising constantly.  An ambitious IT plan for 20102020 undertaken by Vietnamese government may shape many segments of the Vietnamese IT market. It is evident that Vietnams gradual integration into global trade networks ASEAN, WTO is increasing the opportunities for foreign investors and importers. Vietnams IT industry may make strong progress due to growing PC penetration, improvement of IT infrastructure, economic growth, gradual implementation of a range of government IT initiatives and ambitious plans. ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IT OUTSOURCING SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR WESTERN OUTSOURCERS  Cost reductions and abundance of workforce  Today, offshore outsourcing to developing countries is becoming a common practice. The most dominant rationale for offshore outsourcing has been cutting costs. In fact, Carmel and Agarwal 2002 found out that costs were the most significant driver in their fourstage Sourcing of IT Work Offshore Maturity model. Erber and SayedAhmed 2005 suggest that total expected cost savings as high as 40 simply can not be ignored. Cost savings can be gained by cutting labour costs, IT development time, maintenance costs and the timeframe of production processes overall. Software production is a knowledge intensive and complex task where most of the work is done by human intelligence. It is estimated that 70 of a software projects costs are generated by staff expenditures Li  Gao, 2003. Therefore, the most effective way to cut costs Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 46 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy is to reduce personnel costs. Developing countries often offer significantly lower wage levels than developed countries.  Although fixed costs  such as hardware, office and tools expenditures  are not utterly significant in software production, companies can avoid investments by buying outsourcing services, or transferring work to a cheaper country Karolak, 1998. In this case, the investment responsibilities are shifted to the service providers. In addition, on top of low prices, developing countries governments offer promoting incentives for the software industry, especially for companies with exporting activities. These subsidies vary from favourable policy making and human resource development programs to infrastructure subsidies, and tax and import relief Nguyen, 2004 Tan  Leewongcharoen, 2005. The costs are not the only advantage of developing countries and are becoming a less prominent factor. The software industry has been suffering from a skilled workforce shortage. Developing countries, such as India, China and the Southeast Asian countries, have big populations and favourable demographic profiles, i.e. huge portions of the population are aged 15 to 59. In addition, developing countries can annually produce a large amount of IT graduates to fulfil the skills demand. India has successfully developed its education system. However, not every country excels in human resource development like India. For example, Indonesia produced only 5,000 software graduates in 2003 and Thailand roughly employs 40,000 professionals Bruell, 2003 Software Park Thailand, 2007. China is also focusing to improve its human resources to compete with India. In 2004, it produced 56,000 Master and Doctoral graduates in engineering, 8,000 in economics, 17,000 in management, and 17,000 in science. This does not include colleges and other private education institutions National Bureau of Statistica China, 2007. Thus, outsourcing to developing countries can ease the pervasive demand shortage of software professionals. These talents give access to innovative technologies, improve product quality and foster innovation creation. For example, many companies are specialized in niche products or services and thus, have developed a special skill set. The differences in offshore outsourcing between developing countries  e.g. Mainland China vs. Vietnam  A lot of issues have been discussed relating to the similarities, differences, opportunities, strategies and threats between Chinas and Indias IT outsourcing industries. Today, India and China have become the most popular destinations in global outsourcing as both countries offer skilled human resources, cost advantages, quality services, quantity and capabilities of service providers, to name a few. However, so far such kind of discussion between Chinas and Vietnams IT outsourcing industries has got very limited academic attention. Thus, the focal point of this section is to explore these two particular countries IT outsourcing industries from different dimensions to reveal the important characteristics and features of each individual industry.  IT Outsourcing Industry. Chinas IT outsourcing industry is increasingly becoming more mature and rational. Around 85 of Chinas IT outsourcing industry is based on the domestic market, while only 15 on the international market Wang, 2010. In 2009, the total international service outsourcing contracts value was US20.01 billion Devott, 2009. The total value of the Chinese software market is forecasted to reach US11.1 billion in 2010. IT services segment is An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 47 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy projected to achieve a CAGR of 15 between 2010 and 2014 Business Monitor International, 2010b. Jain 2010 addressed in a recent report that China still takes up a small portion of the global total. Despite rapid development, the Chinese outsourcing industry only accounted for 4 of the global total in 2009.  Vietnams IT outsourcing industry, both in terms of domestic and international markets is also growing, but it is considerably small compared to China and other top outsourcing nations. According to Vietnam Business and Economy News 2010, software sales revenue was increased from US680 million in 2008 to US850 million in 2009. Business Monitor International 2010a highlighted that the Vietnamese IT market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 12 over the period of 20102014. The domestic market for IT products and services is projected to reach US2.9 billion by 2014.  Government Policies and Support. The Chinese government has issued a number of favorable policies which may assist the development of Chinas IT outsourcing industry. Wang 2010 stated that with the support of 101001000 project implemented by the Ministry of Commerce, China has chosen 20 cities as model cities of outsourcing which include not only firsttier cities, but also second and thirdtier cities. Consequently, outsourcing businesses are spreading across China at a high speed. Chinese Authorities have been offering strong support to local companies by providing incentive packages and relieving business tax on offshore contracts until 2014 DAltorio, 2010. Expanding to the European and American markets remains the major strategy of the Chinese government and companies. The Chinese government has started awarding Chinas leading and growing service providers. This example has been a true inspiration for other companies as well. The main objective of ICT 2020 vision set up by the Vietnamese government is to develop a technologysavvy workforce for both domestic and global markets and transform Vietnam into a powerful ICT country by 2020 Vietnam Business News, 2010c. To fulfil this vision, the government has started implementing a series of policies, such as developing a number of new software bases along with several new software businesses in Vietnam, developing partnerships with some of the worlds most dominant companies such as Microsoft, IBM, Intel, etc. Microsoft in partnership with the Vietnamese Ministry of Education and Training MoET has developed education programs. These programs include teacher and student education and IT access programs, partners network readiness programs, local IT software startup programs, an innovation centre to train and certify local IT professionals, etc. Vietnam Business News, 2010c. All the abovementioned initiatives are likely to have an impact on the Vietnams IT industry competitive landscape. In addition, a number of associations China Software Industry Association CSIA of China, VINASA of Vietnam, etc. along with the governments of both countries are persistently supporting the promotion and development of IT outsourcing industries. Chinese governments support towards software and services outsourcing industry in particular is huge and large compared to Vietnamese government support.   Education and Training Systems. In the 5 years plan 20062010, a key issue was listed by the Chinese government that is how to Construct the IT Talents Highland Ju, 2008. Keeping it Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 48 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy in mind, the Chinese government is investing heavily in a improving tertiary education, b developing a number of IT schools and colleges, and c establishing English language training centers, etc. Education budget was about US8.11 billion in 2008 this figure being a 45 increase over that of the year of 2007 ChinaToday.com, 2010. However, the education and training of software engineering is still weak in China. Most of software education and training in China does not match the real demands of business.  The education systems shortcomings have created significant challenges for foreign companies seeking to recruit and retain potential Vietnamese employees Vietnam Business News, 2010a. To overcome these shortcomings various strategies are gradually getting implemented in Vietnam. For example, Microsoft is currently contributing to human capital development through capacity building programs in Vietnam. In addition to this, to obtain an innovative mixed education program based on international education models, a number of Vietnamese Universities are having educational collaboration in advanced IT training for Master and PhD students, with wellknown universities all over the world, such as Portland State University in Portland, Oregon, etc. Excel Brothers Inc., 2010. Many foreign companies and universities have established a number of training centres, colleges and universities with Chinese and Vietnamese universities, training centres, software companies and software parks. This is another way to accelerate the growth of the software and services industries in both countries.  IT Workforce. China is graduating around 350,000 engineers and technologists every year. The central government of China aims to increase software professionals to around 600,000 graduates per year Cochrane, 2006.  The Vietnamese Ministry of Information and Telecommunication aspires to produce 528,000 IT professionals by 2020. Vietnam also aspires to develop 25,000 software testing engineers and quickly become an attractive center for investors in the software testing sector Vietnam Business and Economy News, 2010.  In addition, an increasing number of overseas Chinese and Vietnamese graduates are returning to homes to make contribution to their respective software industry. China has more software professionals and they have more diversified technical skills than Vietnam. Vietnams advantage will lie in having a younger population as compared to Chinas fastaging population.  However, there is a real shortage of business analyst, highlevel system architects, designers, product managers, and project managers in both countries. Employee turnover in China and India can be over 10 or even higher whereas in Vietnam it is less than 5 Fire Code JSC, 2008. Most Chinese companies do little to develop and keep their employees.   Infrastructure. IT infrastructure in major Chinese provinces is highly developed but the poor telecom infrastructure is especially evident in the poorer rural areas of the country. All kinds of infrastructures are much more developed in China. Vietnam has an urgent need to upgrade its national infrastructure roads, electricity, telecommunications, Internet bandwidth and access.   An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 49 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy New software parks and companies are rapidly increasing in many cities in China. Currently there are 10 software parks operating in Vietnam. These software parks cannot meet the Governments target annual growth rate of 3540. In addition, Vietnamese authorities and agencies have been building and operating many new software parks, which often house not only Vietnamese software companies and joint ventures, but also 100 foreignowned companies Excel Brothers Inc., 2010. Nonetheless, China has much more software parks than Vietnam.  Legal Systems. Software piracy in China is over 95 and in Vietnam over 85, compared with 76 in neighbouring Thailand Excel Brothers Inc., 2010. Despite the high risk to intellectual property IP theft, many large hightech companies are outsourcing their work to China and Vietnam. Vietnam is steadily improving IP rights protection. More bureaucratic barrier exists in Vietnam than in China.  Language and Culture. China has language advantages in terms of Japanese. Vietnamese employees are more proficient in English than Chinese employees. This is because unlike Chinese language, Vietnamese language uses the Latin alphabet and English is a highly popular language in Vietnam.  There are also cultural similarities between Chinese, Japanese and South Koreans. Vietnam has long been exposed to French, North American, Japanese and Chinese cultures that make it easier for them to execute multicultural outsourcing projects in Vietnam than China. However, both Vietnam and China face cultural differences with Western clients, expenses to travel to offshore clientsmarkets, managerial overheads, timezone differences, etc. Economical and Political Situation. Vietnams economy is not as developed as Chinas economy but it is growing. China is already the third largest economy in the world and it accounts for 7.5 of the worlds total economic activity Money Morning, 2010. China has absorbed foreign direct investment FDI many times more than that by Vietnam. A significant portion of the FDI goes to software and services outsourcing industry in both countries.  Although high political stability and security remain in both countries, Vietnam is much more stable politically and socially than China. IT Services Providing Companies. There are more than 13,000 IT services companies in China ChinaKnowledge, 2010. Totally new 4175 service outsourcing companies emerged in 2009 Devott, 200. Among the top 1000 Chinese companies, 95 have developed offshore outsourcing strategies Wang, 2010.  There are approximately 4,000 ICT companies and around 460,000 employees working in the ICT sector in Vietnam. A majority of these companies are small. Of the 460,000 employed 130,000 in the IT application sector and 90,000 in the software and digital content sector Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010b.  Vietnam is lagging behind China in process capability, software quality certifications, and project management skills. Until now a very few Vietnamese companies have CMM level 5. However, Vietnamese IT companies are persistently putting high efforts to earn international Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L.

Vietnam is a more competitive country than China in terms of qualityprice ratio. Vietnam is rapidly developing as an IT outsourcing destination.   Salary. Software engineers in China can earn annually 7,200, while in Beijing they can earn 9,360. A software engineer can earn an annual salary of 7,056 in Dalian, or salary of 5,760 in Jinan. Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen lead with an average annual salary of 6,687, 6,481 and 5,872 respectively Seeking Alpha, 2009.  Mainland China is a market with numerous IT production activities with high growth rates, resulting in a rapid wage increase of 2540 a year. Salary levels in the country are also three times higher than those in Vietnam. Thus a huge number of big IT companies are looking for new and more suitable business environments, such as Vietnam Vietnam Business News, 2010b. If labor costs increase with such a speed, then China may start sending the jobs to the next lowercost country such as, Vietnam. Marketing Capability. China follows a complicated, personal networkdriven business approach DAltorio, 2010. The market orientation of Chinese is not significantly different from their Vietnamese counterparts. There is a big gap of capacity development between Chinese and Vietnamese companies. To put it simply, both countries have been encountering problems such as, insufficient communication skills, poor international business cultural background, limited overseas marketsclients, lack of cooperative strategies with others, to name a few.  To conclude, many companies are interested in using any of these two countries as an outsourcing destination. However, it can always be a challenge to decide which country best fits their offshore outsourcing objectives and which service providers in the preferred country best fits the requirements of their projects. Yet, there exist many risks in both Chinas and Vietnams IT outsourcing industries and all these risks need to be alleviated.  ADVANTAGES AND CHALLENGES OF VIETNAMESE SOFTWARE OUTSOURCING SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR FINNISH OUTSOURCERS  Dynamic, flexible and cost effective software and services development  Executing offshore outsourcing projects successfully, can be a major value driver for Finnish software companies. It can be a major factor determining company success or failure. Using offshore outsourcing, companies can optimize production costs as well as enabling them to shift resources towards the most valuable projects and products.  The Vietnamese offshore outsourcing industry is in its infancy and the size of the outsourcing service providers are small, but they are often dynamic and flexible Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004 Vietnam Outsourcing Portal, 2010a. The Vietnamese IT market is steadily growing and domestic consumption is adding to its significance. Software parks are being built with modern infrastructure. An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 51 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy Vietnam now has a strong pool of IT employees and is producing 15,000 university graduates and 10,000 college graduates annually Vietnam Outsourcing Portal, 2010b. They are young, creative, hardworking, proWestern, and possess a good educational background. Vietnamese primary education emphasizes science, math and logic that provide a solid foundation for successful IT work. In the case of English proficiency, Vietnam pales compared to India, but usage of roman alphabets and historical heritage generates a better awareness of French and English than surrounding East Asian countries Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004 Vietnam Outsourcing Portal, 2010b. The Vietnamese culture emphasizes collectivism and loyalty, and thus, attrition rates are currently low less than 5 Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004 Fire Code JSC, 2008. Low rates result from increased familiarity and trust within outsourcing service users and service providers, as well as ensuring continuity and control. In addition, it will decrease the overhead costs. From a political and societal point of view, Vietnam is a very stable and secure country. This has been also recognized by the West and Vietnam has been accepted into various trade agreements WTO, AFTA, ASEAN, Bilateral Trade Agreement with US, trade agreement with the EU and organizations Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004 Excel Brothers inc., 2010. The Vietnamese government has recognized the significance of the software industry for the countrys economical and societal advancement by granting many incentives and subsidies, such as free export and valueadded tax for software products, subsidizing infrastructure improvements, improving education and training systems, etc. Today, the number of Vietnamese citizens living in Finland is around 1,600 Statistics Finland, 2007. The offshore Vietnamese diaspora, Viet Kieu, can operate across cultures and languages, moreover, be the key to cushion the illeffects of culture. In addition, the Viet Kieu can be a source of capital and knowhow. To enhance their remigration, government offers a range of incentives from tax breaks to direct ownership of homes and businesses Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004. On top of the aforementioned factors, Vietnam holds one major and often a key decisionmaking factor  relatively low costs, even compared to China. In Vietnam, currently the monthly salary can be estimated to range between US250300 for newcomers, US400500 for the more experienced and US550900 for the highly educated and experienced people Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010b. Salary levels in Vietnam are three times cheaper than China Vietnam Business News, 2010b. Even some studies say, in Vietnam labor costs are 90 less than in the USA Fire Code JSC, 2008. This cost advantage has been noticed by foreign multinational companies and even Indian outsourcing service providers have opened offices in Vietnam. Furthermore, the approximately 40 50 lower wages are a significant advantage over the market leader, India. Limited resources, technical expertise and experience  The coin always has two sides. Software companies in Vietnam are in most cases small, possess limited resources and lack stateoftheart knowledge and experience in business administration Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004. According to Chidamber 2003, they are less trained than Carmels 2003a other Tier 3 or Tier 4 nations. They lack information about markets and customers, and marketing activities are underdeveloped. Thus, software companies face barriers Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L.

VINASA, established in 2002, is the leading nongovernmental organization and one of their main goals is to overcome this challenge Vietnam Software Association, 2006. The role of VINASA is crucial as it is the main voice of software companies in governmental committees and on the international stage. However, VINASA is also young in operation and is still being developed.  Vietnamese research and development RD capacity is limited and not invested appropriately. This is due to limited resources, unconvertible currency  dong  along with an underdeveloped banking and funding sector. Most of the bank loans are still going to stateowned companies where profit margins are slim or none Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004. The credibility of Vietnamese outsourcing service providers is also quite slim, as only a few have international experience and international quality certificates. Currently, more than 20 Vietnamese software companies have obtained international quality management certificates, such as CMMI5, CMM4 or 3 and more than 40 companies have been certified with ISO 90013, TL 9000 and ISO 27001 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, 2010b BusinessinAsia.com, 2010. By 2020, Vietnam will need 528,000 employees in IT fields, including 148,000 professionals in the software sector. Due to shortcomings in education system and limited training capability, Vietnam may not satisfy international demands Vietnam Business  Economy News, 2010.  Vietnamese IT firms employees are often new graduates with limited practical experiences, teamwork capacity and management skills. In addition, the education system is rather chaotic as the tertiary education system is not cohesive and the assortment of certificates creates confusion HoChiMinh Computer Association, 2006 Vietnam Business News, 2010a. Despite stability, the Vietnamese administration has a reputation of being slow moving, extremely corrupt and capricious when dealing with foreign companies Gallaugher  Stoller, 2004. The Vietnam Corruption Perception Index rank was 116th of 178 countries Transparency International, 2010 and even ministers were caught in corruption scandals Transparency International, 2005. In addition, weak IP rights protection and enforcement, as well as a weak legal system and policy enforcement create an unfavourable situation for the IT offshore outsourcing industry. Although its piracy rate has been gradually going down, Vietnam is still among the top20 countries violating the IP rights protection Dzung, 2008 Excel Brothers Inc., 2010. These problems are currently being addressed by the government, such as adding transparency, comprehensive and concrete policies, but the speed of change is rather sluggish. Like many other developing countries, Vietnams general infrastructure level is low, even though it is developing fast. The situation is adequate in software parks and big cities, but commonly in poor condition elsewhere. Although, the Vietnamese government has invested heavily in communications technology, almost doubling the capacity of wired telephone connections, the telecommunication and internet connection are often expensive and unstable HoChiHinh Software Association, 2006 Dzung, 2008. In addition, the flow of information on the internet is strictly controlled by the government, as it was banned before 1997. For example, the capacity of the global internet gateways of Vietnam, controlled by both stateowned VNPT and FPT Telecom HoChiMinh Software Association, 2006.

APPROACHES OF WESTERN COMPANIES TO USE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS IT OUTSOURCING DESTINATIONS  Types of offshore outsourcing  Outsourcing can be divided into the following taxonomy Lacity  Hirchheim, 1993, 1995 Nahar et al., 2002 Lane et al., 2005 Siemens IT Solutions and Services, 2007 body shopping, staff augmentation, project management, selective sourcing and total outsourcing. Body shopping is usually chosen when an organization wants to fulfil short term demands. Commonly, it is implemented by the use of contract programmerspersonnel, usually within organizations facilities, i.e. onsite, that is managed by company management. Staff augmentation is an arrangement wherein the service provider agrees to offer specific skilled human resource to supplement personnel from the clients side. In this mode of operation, the service provider does not take on any accountability or risk. Project management outsourcing handles a specific project or a portion of IT work where the outsourcing service provider is responsible for managing and completing the project. Selective sourcing is an option, where each company decides to outsource a selected IT function to external service providers, while retaining the budget internally between 20 and 80. Total outsourcing occurs when the service provider is in total charge of the IT work. In total outsourcing, most of the IT work over 80 is handled by an external service provider, or retained within company walls. This taxonomy defines different level of service provider commitment and responsibilities. Sharma 2006 presents four models to effectively utilize global software development resources. The models are jobshop, componentresponsibility, productincubation, and business incubation. In the jobshop model, companies retain product architecture and design at their home office while coding, testing and sustenance engineering are sent to lowcost destinations, such as Vietnam or China or India. Componentresponsibility model takes advantage of the service providers specialization, because the responsibility of components or subproducts is handled by different development sites. Those sites have full responsibility for the software development cycle from design to coding and testing. This requires more collaboration between service providers and service users to fully receive all benefits. The productincubation model is usually exercised by startups, because it requires none or little technical and engineering knowledge. In this model, companies deal out all the engineering responsibilities to an external service provider while keeping all the customerinvolving tasks such as sales, marketing and all other nonengineering activities, including product management, closer to the market and the customer. The final model, businessincubation, is often used by the multinational companies to incubate new businesses and associated business models within the emerging markets themselves. This is an experimental model where companies try out new ideas and create a better position in the emerging market. The abovementioned models and factors deal with service users strategies and capabilities. Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 54 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy A special issue both service providers and users must pay attention to is the choosing of an appropriate pricing model during the contract negotiations. According to Robinson and Kalakota 2004, the most popular pricing models are a fixed, b transactional, c activitybased, d costplus, e gainsharing or riskreward, and f hybrid pricing models. Each of these pricing models has its pros and cons, so suits different needs. The fixed pricing model is often chosen because it leaves little room for misinterpretations and is easy to budget, especially if the volumes can be predicted. In this model, both service user and service provider agree about the software products, or services to be developed in exchange for a fixed price. Failing to accurately estimate the needed resources and time, or any other failure to fulfil the contractual obligations within the specified time, will negatively affect the revenue of the service providers. Another popular pricing model, especially in the field of business process outsourcing, is the transactional pricing model, or traditionally unit pricing. In this model, the service user pays the service provider according to the produced unit of work. The advantages are ease of design and implementation, ease of understanding and budgeting, and clearly defined terms with little risk for misinterpretations. It is similar to fixed pricing model. A more complex and flexible pricing model is the activitybased pricing model, where a service user agrees to pay a flat fee for covering the service providers fixed costs, such as leases, hardware, software and telecommunication. This models strengths are accurately reflected costs according to real outputs, overpricing to cover risks is not necessary, and it allows companies to more precisely track costs. The costplus pricing model is often used as a temporary contractual measure. It consists of a fee for cost of services plus a mutually agreed extra upon profit margin. Costplus pricing is an effective nature of the contract in transition. Costplus pricing protects service users from protective overpricing by the service providers. Conversely, costplus pricing protects service providers from losses due to volatile volumes and business levels by being guaranteed a profit. In difference to the previous pricing models, the gainsharing pricing model may contain one or many of the aforementioned pricing structures, in addition to concentrating on rewarding improvements and exceptional performance by benchmarking the defined key performance indicators, or areas that require progress. The gainsharing model implies service providers continuously work harder to create value  when the customers benefits, they will too. Hybrid pricing models can be used when none of the earlier pricing models alone fit the needs of both parties. Hybrid modelling is any combination of pricing models, and it will add complexity to the contract negotiations and performance monitoring, but it responds better to the specific requirements of each outsourcing project. Another popular model is time and material based pricing model. This model is used, when the scope, specification and implementation plans cannot be accurately defined for a software development project. This model offers the flexibility of varying the size and workloads of the software development team assigned to the project, while optimizing time and costs Sharp Interactive, 2011.  An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 55 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy The current status of IT outsourcing practices in Finland and Vietnam  A few large and mediumsized Finnish IT companies are acting as service providers for foreign and domestic clients. For example, Tieto, a Finnish company is one of the leading IT service providers in Nordic countries providing IT, RD and consultation services. It has operations in more than 25 countries and having approximately 17,000 employees tieto.com, 2010.  In our recent interviews with a number of Finnish IT executives, we learnt that several of these Finnish companies have established their subsidiaries software and services development centres in onshore, near shore e.g. Sweden, Estonia, Russia, Hungary, Romania and offshore e.g. China, India. Some of these companies are service providers, who are developing software products and services for their clients as well as some are clients, who are developing software products and services for their parent companies. They are utilizing single or multivendors or dual approaches and deploying a number of offshore business models, such as offshore development centres, pure outsourcing, managed outsourcing, pure captive centre, collaborative onsiteoffshore development, etc. Even many Finnish IT services companies are adopting a global delivery model based on four components onshore same country as client onsite at the client site, near shore country near to client country and offshore. It is evident that some Finnish companies are expanding their business portfolio through mergers and acquisitions. In addition, Nokia attracts outsourcing service providers searching for partnerships with Finnish companies.  The subsequent types of outsourcing are commonly used by Finnish IT companies higher level requirement analysis, programming, testing, shared responsibility, project management, subcontractor responsibility and business process outsourcing. Other forms of RD outsourcing are rarely used. It is apparent that selective outsourcing is highly preferred by the Finnish companies.  According to, Vietnamese ICT Delegation 2008, about 20 wellknown Vietnamese software and ICT companies had visited two cities i.e. Helsinki and Turku in Finland in October 2008, in order to get a better understanding of the ICT sector in Finland as well as initiating cooperation with Finnish companies. The seminars dealt comprehensively with these two countries mutual interests in the ICT sector. In addition, the Vietnamese delegates had visited many key players of the Finnish innovation system, information society and universities.  The Embassy of Finland in Hanoi assisted in organizing and financing the trip. The main objectives of this trip were to support capacitybuilding of the private sector in Vietnam and enhance FinnishVietnamese business partnerships. After this event, several Finnish companies had visited Vietnam to explore the offshore outsourcing opportunities and a few of them may have already entered Vietnam.  SPECIAL ISSUES FOR FINNISH COMPANIES IN USING VIETNAM AS AN OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING DESTINATION  Compared to other Nordic countries, it is obvious that Finnish IT companies are using offshore outsourcing in a limited scale. To put it simply, Finnish software companies have not yet Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 56 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy discovered offshore outsourcing as a feasible approach for producing software. The factors limiting offshore outsourcing are the immature product development processes that Finnish software companies are using, inefficiency in finding the right modules to be outsourced, inability in giving in detail specific requirements Ronkko et al., 2007, small size of the companies, lack of international business knowhow, to name a few. Therefore, with low experience levels both in Finland and in Vietnam, companies should take extra care of the outsourcing process. Kyostila and Cardwell 2005 and Yalaho and Nahar 2009 revealed that from the Finnish managers point of view, a competence of workforce, b English language skills, c wage rates, d level of IP rights protection, and e social and political stability were the most important location factors. These factors should be taken into account when service users decide the outsourcing strategy. In addition, Asian culture, including Vietnamese, has large impact on business relationships. The cultural difference creates a significant barrier to the outsourcing process and must be managed. For example, sometimes Asian employees seem to lack initiative, but this is due to the large power distance as they are expecting those in higher hierarchies to give out orders. In addition, uncertainty avoidance means that risk taking is not favoured. The next significant issue in Asian culture is trust. Thus, trust creation often requires time and personal contacts lengthen sales cycles and increase costs Beulen  Ribbers, 2002. Finnish companies should start with small projects to gain the crucial experience and management knowhow, as well as preparing their organizations and working methods for offshore outsourcing software development. Carmel and Agarwal 2002 found that domestic mindset and inexperience were the two major factors for companies not to implement offshore outsourcing. The organizational culture and change resistance can also hinder a companys willingness to outsource. Another factor favouring offshore outsourcing in Finland is that domestic service providers prefer long term contracts and charge more for contracts under six months Nahar et al., 2002. Long term contracts will lessen the flexibility that can be achieved by outsourcing. SPECIAL ISSUES FOR VIETNAMESE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE OUTSOURCING SERVICES TO FINNISH COMPANIES  This subsection adds to the discussion about the specific circumstances of Vietnamese outsourcing service providers providing their services for Finnish outsourcing service users. Currently, India and China are the most preferred offshore outsourcing destinations among Finnish software companies. In addition, near shore destinations, such as the Baltic countries, Russia, Hungary and Romania are also favoured. Thus, Vietnam must create a competitive advantage over these nations to entice the Finns to enter the Vietnamese offshore outsourcing market. Nahar et al. 2002 addressed that work permit and visa barriers often prohibit Finnish companies using the bodyshopping strategy. Therefore, Vietnamese companies options are narrowed down to offshore software development services and cooperation. An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 57 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy As discussed earlier, there are approximately 1,600 Vietnamese diaspora living in Finland. Many of the Finnish Viet Kieu have been born and educated in Finland and are familiar with the language, culture and working methods. Gallaugher and Stoller 2004 have noted that in their case company, the Viet Kieu senior management team, which had received their upbringing and education in the US, helped to efficiently overcome cultural and linguistic barriers. Another source of culture mediators can be found from Vietnams history of development cooperation. According to the Finnish Foreign Ministry 2001, Finlands and Vietnams development cooperation history dates back to the mid 1970s. During these years, Finland has become known to local people and vice versa. The Vietnamese companies could utilize those connections created during the development cooperation project by hiring the former staff. They possess hands on experience and knowledge of both sides, and that knowledge can become crucial during service user procurement, project implementation and marketing. Vietnam is closely connected with China and Japan in terms of culture, thus, creating a natural and easy destination to procure service users. Japan, especially, has been a significant service user base for Vietnamese service providers, and, for instance, one of VINASAs primary goals is to enhance VietnamJapan collaboration Vietnam Software Association, 2006 Vietnam Business News, 2010c. European companies have not yet fully discovered Vietnam as an outsourcing destination, as seen from VINASAs report of Top 10 outsourcing service providers. In most cases, the share of European customers in offshore revenues are nil to 10. For that reason, Vietnamese service providers should increase their awareness in Finland and other European countries by marketing campaigns and trade agreements. To summarize this section, Vietnam and its offshore outsourcing industry was discussed as a possible destination for Finnish software developers. The review found out that Vietnam has already created a good impression on the global outsourcing market. Vietnamese software companies are growing at a fast pace. Vietnams strengths in terms of outsourcing destination are, for example, a low costs, b abundant young, but to some extent welleducated, hardworking and loyal workforce, c strong government support, and d stable political, social and economical environment. The shortcomings are, for example, a small amount and size of firms, b lack of experience, c lack of management and marketing skills, d poor level of infrastructure, and e poor level of IP rights protection and legal environment. The discussions above show that there are a lot of benefits and challenges involved in offshore outsourcing of software development to developing countries. The review also discussed the special issues involved in the outsourcing relation between Finnish and Vietnamese firms. These issues are different levels of expertise, infrastructure, way of doing business, working methods, cultures, time zones and distances, and their impact on the offshore outsourcing process. Finally, the review described approaches and implications for companies of developing and developed countries regarding how to create and implement successful outsourcing projects. The literature review described in this section has been utilized as a foundation for the conceptual model.     Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L.

The model has been constructed to answer the knowledge gap highlighted by the research question and the research objectives. The model see Figure 1 features the process of offshore outsourcing of software development the environment where this outsourcing takes place the special requirements and challenges of outsourcing to developing countries from Western outsourcing service users and the developing countrys outsourcing service providers points of view. These macro level factors are country specific therefore, companies have to create plans for how to cope with the environmental challenges. From macro level environmental factors, the model moves to company level factors. The outsourcing process is aligned with the macro and micro level factors by weighing the advantages and challenges. Global and country environment Global economy and politics have an impact on international business, and thus, on offshore outsourcing. Within globalized commerce, there are country specific factors, which should be considered in offshore outsourcing projects. The country or macro level factors are a the level of availability of adequate and skilled human resources, b the availability of adequate technological and societal infrastructure, c governmental policies and legal framework, d geographical location, e cultural and language skills, f general cost levels, and g other possible factors Nahar et al., 2002 Tessler et al., 2003 Carmel, 2003b Tan  Leewongcharoen, 2005 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. These factors need to be considered for both the home country of the outsourcing service users and the destination country where the outsourcing service providers are resided. Availability of Adequate and Skilled Human Resources. As described earlier, the most critical resource of IT work is human resource. The lack of skilled IT professionals in Western countries has become a prominent challenge for local companies Galup et al., 2004 Rao, 2004 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. Hunting employees abroad may be a solution for this question, but there are many impending pit falls. Outsourcing service users should assess that there is enough workforce with adequate technological, managerial and project work skills in the destination country currently and also for the future. In the case of developing countries, there are plenty of IT professionals. India, China and other countries produce a great deal of new IT workforce, but the challenge is lack of experience. Most of the developing countries workforce is newly graduated and there is a lack of hands on knowledge of the industry. In addition, the literature review described challenges in the developing countries education systems and chaotic nature of diplomas, attrition rate and lack of experienced workforce, which will result in increased coordination and management costs Kalakota  Robinson, 2005 Erber Erber  SayedAhmed, 2005 Yalaho  Nahar, 2008.

The level of telecommunication networks, such as telephone, mobile phone and facsimile.   Availability of hardware, such as computers, networking and communication hardware, and software.  Electricity supply and urban infrastructure.  For example, Vietnamese companies need to tackle obstacles, such as low bandwidth internet connections, because all the communication is passing through the governments controlled gateway. Developing countries have also notoriously lacked behind Western countries in societal development. Challenges are Nahar et al., 2002 Orlic et al., 2003 Nguyen, 2004 Rao, 2004   Corruption.

Poor or total lack of social security system.  Poverty and big income gaps. Barriers regarding corruption, legal systems, low IP rights protection and enforcement require that companies must pay extra attention to risk management. Government Support. The software outsourcing industry in developing countries needs the governments full support. Governments have many options to subsidize the industry by Nahar et al., 2002 Tessler et al., 2003 Nguyen, 2004 Erber  SayedAhmed, 2005 Tan  Leewongcharoen, 2005   Setting up favourable investment and operating environments through creating a funding and investment system, and giving out tax relieves.  Expanding the market, by subsidizing local companies and creating favourable market environments for software companies.  Developing human resources, by creating high quality education systems.  Protecting copyrights and fair trade, by introducing comprehensive laws and law enforcement.  Creating a reliable telecommunication infrastructure. The literature review found that the governments actions are critical to a countrys success. Culture and Language. At the country level, the differing nature of culture can create a negative impact on operations in offshore outsourcing. At the firm level, there are also different corporate and organizational culture and practices e.g. issues such business moral and norms are paramount Nicholson  Sahay, 2001 Krishna et al., 2004.

Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 61 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy cultural differences and language barriers are one of the major obstacles of virtual teams. Each country has its own culture and some have their own languages that can cause problems in outsourcing relationships such as a communication problems, e.g. misunderstandings and misinterpretations, b loss of cohesion, and c lack of trust. Some developing countries, including Vietnam, have to improve their proficiency in English, which is the most common language in Western world. In addition, English is often the organizational language of major Finnish companies. Cost Levels. Cost saving has always been one of the major rationales for companies to seek for outsourcing services. The literature review found out that by outsourcing to developing countries companies can save a significant amount of money. Cost savings can be gained by Carmel  Agarwal, 2002 Nahar et al., 2002 Koong et al., 2003 Erber  SayedAhmed, 2005 Tan  Leewongcharoen, 2005 a low salary rates of software professionals, b low costs of hardware and infrastructure, c low attrition rates, and d governments support, e.g. tax and office subsidies. However, salaries are continuously rising in developing countries. Companies should offer good salaries and various incentive programs to attract and retain highly skilled IT employees. This factor applies only to the countries of the outsourcing service providers. Outsourcing service users should consider these issues and compare to their home country costs as to whether cost savings can be achieved.  Other Factors. In addition to aforementioned factors, there may be service user specific requirements for the selection of a suitable country, such as geographical location, potential market base for the future, cultural affinity, and a favourable political and economic situation. Geographical location can enable companies to pursue 24 hour workdays by following the sun, or lower coordination and communication costs if the country is located near the service users home country. Companies may also value countries with a potentially big customer base and commercial possibilities. These countries have a big population, growing consumer base and market growth potential. A favourable political, social and economic situation reduces risks and enhances stability. Company level factors Company level factors are a skills, capabilities and experiences, b strategy and vision, and c facilities and infrastructure. These factors must be assessed by both outsourcing service providers and users. From a service users point of view, selection of a suitable service provider is a critical task. Skills, Capabilities and Experiences. The knowledge level of both the service user and service provider needs to be measured. The service users capabilities for outsourcing work should be measured before entering outsourcing projects. Service users should assess their a business and domain knowledge, b technological capabilities, c management and searching skills, d outsourcing process skills, e financial and human resources, f communication skills and cultural awareness, g organization, technical and communication infrastructure, etc. Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 62 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy Companies willing to purchase outsourcing services should be ready on every level of their organization from the top managers to project personnel. Adequate training, if necessary, should be provided to overcome the barriers of culture, communication and outsourcing work. Moreover, service providers should be measured by their a domain and business knowledge, b technological and software development capabilities, c project management expertise, d financial and human resources, e size, f acquired references, quality standards and certifications, g experience in offshore outsourcing, etc. Choosing of suitable service providers from developing countries is a critical operation for Western outsourcers. There are many challenging barriers facing service providers in developing countries, and often compromises should be made. Therefore, Western service users should critically examine every aspect of outsourcing. Companys Strategy and Vision. According to Carmel and Agarwal 2002, companies with clear and persistent strategy and vision will benefit the most from outsourcing. A companys vision, objectives and business strategy will shape the goals they want to pursue. To be able to achieve those goals, plans should be made. Therefore, Hassan 2000 has shaped four different strategies for achieving success, which are a human resource, b financial resource, c technology, and d marketing.   The developing countries challenges have an impact on every aforementioned strategy. For example, the financial strategy should take into consideration in improving the often underdeveloped financial systems, currencies and regulations. Marketing strategies tackle developing countries deficient marketing channels and technology strategies to immature infrastructure. Human resource strategies are also extremely important while operating in developing countries. Often chaotic education systems, quality differences in teaching, and an abundant amount of graduates create uncertainties and pit holes.  Companys Facilities and Infrastructure. In this issue, companies in developing countries have much larger obstacles than Western companies. New software parks and technology centres are built in developing countries to help local companies overcome the disadvantages of immature infrastructure and communication networks Nahar et al., 2002 Tessler et al., 2003 Nguyen, 2004 Wei  Peach, 2006 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. Prospective service providers should have the full scale of hardware and software resources as well as office premises, telecommunication resources and electricity reserves. In contrast, largesized Western service users often have top notch facilities and communications infrastructure. However, service users should prepare for possible obstacles created by poor infrastructure in developing countries, by developing clear instructions and alternative methods.  Software development through offshore outsourcing process  The software development through offshore outsourcing process has been introduced in the literature review Nahar et al., 2002 Momme, 2002 Momme  Hvolby, 2002 Wei  Peach, 2006 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. This section provides an insight on the issues developing countries have on each step of offshore outsourcing of software development process. An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 63 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy 1. Strategic analysis and decision is the first step. The companies should evaluate their strategy and resources, as well as analyze if outsourcing fits their vision and will help them reach their goals. Different aspects of software development through offshore outsourcing process, such as opportunities and challenges, must be assessed before making the decision to outsource software development partly or on a full scale. 2. International market research for offshore outsourcing of software development is the second phase. Moreover, this is where countries are assessed and the country related factors are weighted for choosing a suitable destination, or destinations with a lower level of risk, from which the potential outsourcing service providers are searched. In the case of developing countries, the challenges have been discussed in the literature review and earlier in the model. 3. The international promotion of offshore outsourcing of software development phases aim is to raise awareness of the company and its needs within potential service providers in identified countries. If the phase is successfully conducted, knowledge about service providers is gathered and used in the next phase. Challenges identified in the literature review with developing countries in this phase are geographic distance, cultural differences, poor communication and marketing skills, and lack of effective marketing channels Nahar et al., 2002 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. To leverage the barriers, software business associations, such as VINASA, CSIA and NASSCOM, were created in Vietnam, China and India. They are also an effective source of knowledge. To identify appropriate service providers in Vietnam, Western customers can communicate with VINASA. 4. Selection of a suitable outsourcing service provider is performed by processing the information gathered in the earlier phase. The potential service providers are comprehensively researched by assessing issues Sparrow, 2003 White  Cook, 2003 Mahaney  Greer, 2004 Goland, 2005 Wei  Peach, 2006 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009, such as business and domain knowledge, technological and software capabilities, project management expertise, adequate financial resource, adequate and skilled human resources, size, a satisfactory references list, quality standards and certifications, and experience in outsourcing. Service providers in developing countries often have shortcomings that must be considered. For example, Vietnamese service providers often lack experience, seasoned and skilled professionals, as well as suffer from poor infrastructure.  5. Negotiation and contract is finally signed with the chosen potential service provider. The offshore outsourcing contract is an important part of establishing an effective partnership. Negotiable issues such as, responsibilities, the actual product or service requirements, performance measurements, delivery time, offshore business models, pricing models, payment arrangements and termination, are put into context Bryson  Ngwenyama, 2000 Nahar et al., 2002 Nguyen et al., 2006 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. Immature legal systems, weak IP rights protection, lack of transparency, corruption and unpredictable law enforcement in developing countries are barriers for Western companies during this phase. 6. Implementation of the outsourcing project. The main activities of this phase include developing an implementation and commissioning plan, building a joint implementation and commissioning team, training the employees of both parties, reviewing of milestones, testing, quality assurance and the reporting of progress by the service provider. In some cases, the Journal of International Technology and Information Management N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen    International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 64 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy service user brings the service provider employees onsite and provides them with training on issues, such as organizational practices, norms, crosscultural issues, business domain, methodological tools e.g. architectural modeling, the final specification design phase, as well as to get to know each other better Momme  Hvolby, 2002 Sahay et al., 2003 Nicholson  Sahay, 2004 Yalaho  Nahar, 2009. Challenges of developing countries service providers, are lack of technically experienced professionals and poor infrastructure in exchange for low costs. Managing one or more external service providers as part of an outsourcing strategy is essential as relationships become of greater importance to mitigate risks and to reduce costs, etc. After reviewing the finished software product according to the agreement and contracted pricing model.  7. Financial issues are handled. Difficulties in this phase are raised by immature banking and funding systems, as well as inflexible and potentially unconvertible currencies. Therefore, companies have to find ways to overcome these barriers. According to Gallaugher and Stoller 2004, their case company went around the problem by directing the payments through the US parent company. Yalaho and Nahar 2009 stated that their service providing companies faced cash flow problem. When the service users delayed payments, the service providers had no control over it. They may loose their service users if they put some charges. Therefore, they used bridge financing. 8. The software products and documents are delivered to the service user subsequent to the clearance of financial issues followed by 9. Termination of the outsourcing relation or continue with a negotiation of a new project. If the continuation is chosen for a new project, the company will return to the negotiation and contract signing phase and continue. In the case of termination, the service user will start the outsourcing process by reassessing the international markets and selecting a suitable service provider, or conducting a new strategic analysis on the basis of their outsourcing experiences. To conclude, the conceptual model was developed on the basis of the literature review and our long practical experience in managing of offshore IS development projects. The model included the main issues involved in offshore outsourcing of software development to developing countries. The focus has been on identifying the service providers capabilities, as well as opportunities and barriers of developing countries and outsourcing service providers located in those countries. The factors are divided into three levels global and country specific, company specific and outsourcing process specific. These can affect the success of outsourcing projects. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS No previous research existed concerning offshore outsourcing of software development to Vietnam by Finnish outsourcers and this was proven by the indepth literature review. The study answered the research problem by a analyzing the Vietnams IT industry and differentiating it with Chinese IT industry from various important aspects in terms of software and services outsourcing, b reviewing the literature concerning outsourcing of offshore software development, and c identifying the key challenges and opportunities to outsource to Vietnam and types of offshore outsourcing that may be used to do so. An Integrative Conceptual Model of Vietnam as an Emerging Destination N. Nahar  L. Kuivanen   International Information Management Association, Inc, 2010 65 ISSN  15435962Printed Copy       ISSN  19416679Online Copy Through an indepth literature review, the study found out that Vietnam has already created a good impression on the global outsourcing market. Vietnamese software companies are growing at a rapid pace thus their potential is already evident. The findings reveal that Vietnams strengths in terms of outsourcing destination are, for example, a low costs, b abundant young, to some extent welleducated, hardworking and loyal workforce, c strong government support, and d stable political, social and economical environment. Vietnam is in a better position than China in terms of the advantage of low labor costs, English fluency, and political and ethnic stability. Vietnam has already ranked as the 10th favoured outsourcing destination. Vietnam can become a competitor to China and India in the future. However, there are still various problems in Vietnams IT outsourcing industry. All these problems need to be alleviated by enhancing technical expertise, advancing managerial skills, adopting new ideas, scaling up capacity, improving international business practices, and enhancing process capability. These will create further opportunities for Vietnamese companies to succeed in wining more international outsourcing contracts. The model developed in this study focused on three major categories of factors and their associated subfactors that are important to the success of offshore outsourcing projects. These factors are a global and country level factors, b company level factors, and c the actual offshore outsourcing process and how it is implemented. By using the research results i.e. the conceptual model, Finnish and other Western outsourcing users may be able to effectively use Vietnam as a destination for software development outsourcing. Vietnamese service providers may also be able to effectively deal with Finnish and other Western outsourcing users. A few more implications of this study include that service provider and user companies can analyze the potential risks and key issues during designing, implementing and managing the outsourcing process. Service provider and user companies can adopt measures introduced in this study to overcome these challenges. Finnish companies can identify if it is beneficial for them to outsource to developing and emerging countries, especially Vietnam. IT companies can have a better understanding of Vietnams IT industry and potential prospects. Governments policy makers can have a better insight of the problems and can produce incentives and improve national and organizational environments for offshore software outsourcing. The model can be applicable to any developed and developing countries, not limited to Finland and Vietnam. Thus, in its depth, range and contributions this study provides a greater richness of understanding this area. However, further research in this area is needed to validate the conceptual model empirically. In our next paper, we will validate this model by conducting a multiple case study.
