A soundly built theoretical base is invaluable for working with applications and software development, and is a necessity for further study and research in computer science. The bachelor study program usually takes three years and ends with a state final exam, after the successful completion of which the student is awarded the title of bachelor. The degree awarded is accredited by the Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports of the Czech Republic and is internationally recognized. The language of instruction is English. In the first year , there are basic mathematical courses ( Mathematical Analysis I , II , Linear Algebra I , II , Discrete Mathematics , Combinatorics and Graphs ), and introductory courses to programming and computers ( Programming I , II , Principles of Computers , Introduction to Networking , Algorithms and Data Structures , Introduction to UNIX ). During the second year students learn further mathematical theory ( Mathematical Analysis III , Propositional and Predicate Logic , Probability and Statistics ), as well as the theoretical basics of programming and computers ( Algorithms and Data Structures II , Optimization Methods , Non-Procedural Programming , Automata and Grammars , Database Systems ). In the second year, students are also required to learn some practical programming (they have to choose one of the following courses: Programming in C++ , Java , C# Language and .NET Framework ) and present an Individual Software Project. The students should choose other courses according to their individual needs and interests. During the third year , students are expected to work on their bachelor thesis. There is only one further mathematical course ( Algebra ) recommended for the third year. Obligatory courses are complemented by courses chosen by the student him/herself. Here you can download the complete list of obligatory and elective courses for our bachelor Computer Science program. Graduates  from our program are familiar with the fundamentals of mathematics and computer science. They have both theoretical and practical experience with programming and basic knowledge in more specific areas according to their choice of advanced classes. The acquired skills provide a good background for a follow-up master’s degree, as well as sufficient knowledge for immediate employment. Graduates are able to perform well in any position where logical thinking is required. They can also work as programmers or network administrators. Master’s Degree Programs In our Master’s programs, students are given a broad overview of their field, helping them to think independently, to distinguish between important and marginal problems, and to accommodate quickly to novel technologies. The focus is on understanding the core principles of how and why things work and on the application of these principles within modern technologies. The strong theoretical basis of the Master’s study program gives our graduates a competitive advantage in a dynamically evolving world where today’s technologies are often obsolete tomorrow. Studies usually take two years and finish with a state final exam and Master’s thesis defense. After successful completion the student is awarded the title of a Master of Science. Master’s Program in Computer Science Currently we provide seven study branches in English: Theoretical Computer Science. Computational Linguistics. Discrete Models and Algorithms. Computer Graphics and Game Development. Software and Data Engineering. Software Systems. Artificial Intelligence. A complete description (obligatory and elective courses) of the Master of Computer Science programme is here . The study program is very flexible and students can customize their set of attended courses based on their particular interests and needs. In the first year , there are mandatory foundational courses such as data structures and theory of complexity and computability. Students of Computational Linguistics also have courses on natural language processing and statistical methods and they begin work on a group software project, while students of Discrete Models and Algorithms have courses on combinatorics, graph theory, and optimization. Some courses on specific subjects, as described next, are also included in the first year. The second year of studies is organized according to the student’s own selection of courses. This is based on the choice of study plan within the study branch. We offer courses on artificial intelligence and its sub-areas such as machine learning, planning, declarative programming, and neural networks, several linguistics courses, courses on speech recognition and machine translation, and courses on optimization techniques (non-linear, combinatorial, multi-criteria), integer programming, mathematical structures, algorithms and their complexity, and approximation and probabilistic algorithms. Students may attend some of these courses already in their first year, so that in their second year they can focus on finishing their master’s thesis. Master’s Program in Mathematics The Master’s program in Mathematics leads students to achieve a deep and solid understanding of higher mathematics. It is designed to encourage analytical thinking, creativity and comprehensive understanding combined with ability to apply mathematical methods to real-life problems. It offers degrees in several study branches ranging from pure abstract mathematics to applications in various fields: Mathematical Structures provide deep knowledge of advanced algebra, geometry, logic, and combinatorics. Mathematical Analysis focuses on advanced real function theory, complex analysis, functional analysis, ordinary and partial differential equations. Numerical and Computational Mathematics deals with design, analysis, algorithmization, and implementation of methods for computer processing of mathematical models. Mathematical Modeling in Physics and Technology is an interdisciplinary field connecting mathematical analysis, numerical mathematics, and physics to develop and apply mathematical models of natural phenomena. Probability, Mathematical Statistics and Econometrics offers advanced courses in probability theory, optimization, statistical modeling, and random processes, and applies the methods to solve problems from economics, technology, natural sciences, and informatics. Financial and Insurance Mathematics focuses on mathematical methods for finance, life and non-life insurance, and financial management. The graduates find employment not only at universities and research institutes, but also in banks, financial and insurance companies, pharmaceutical industry, software industry, marketing, or telecommunication companies.

In each semester, there are 13 weeks of teaching and an examination period of 5 weeks. The courses are mostly in the form of lectures and recitations. The lectures cover the theoretical underpinnings of the subject, and there is time for applications of the theory in the recitations. The schedule of the faculty consists of 45-minute lessons with 5-minute breaks, and most of the lectures and recitations are organized as 90-minute long blocks of two such lessons once or twice a week. Attendance of lectures and recitations is usually not obligatory, but is strongly recommended. Mastery of a subject is confirmed by course credit and/or by an exam. Course credits (usually for recitations) are awarded at the end of the semester. The conditions for obtaining a course credit differ according to the nature of the course, from completing a test to programming an application or writing a survey. Exams are taken during the 5-week examination period and can be oral or written . Want to know more?
