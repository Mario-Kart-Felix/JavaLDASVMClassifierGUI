Report on Question 162 xi PREFACE 1 Historical background In todays Global Information Society GIS and Global Information Economy GIE, the telecommunication sector is expected to play a major role as a leading industry in the 21st century. To meet the requirements of this new century and to close the communication gap between the industrialized and developing countries, the sharing of knowledge in telecommunication technology and services is a very important step. This was recognized by the first World Development Telecommunication Conference held in Buenos Aires, 2129 March 1994, and also confirmed by the second World Telecommunication Development Conference held in Valletta, 23 March1 April 1998, which established two Study Groups  Study Group 1 dealing with telecommunication development strategy and policies.  Study Group 2 dealing with development and management of telecommunication services and networks.  The particular Question 22 in the first Study Period and Question 162 in the present Study Period of Study Group 2 has the objective to prepare new handbooks or revise the existing ones to spread knowledge and knowhow in these fields. The handbook New Technologies and New Services is one way to achieve this objective. 2 Purpose of the handbook  The rapid development of telecommunications, from technological to market aspects, brings with it every day new products, equipment, systems, networks and services. It would be somewhat ambitious to attempt to produce a handbook that comprises all aspects of new technologies and new services in telecommunication matters and that fulfils, the needs of all players in the telecommunication arena.  The aim of this handbook is to provide a survey of technologies and new services taking place in the changing telecommunication environment, by presenting the general characteristics and capabilities that various networks and new services offer on the market, although not dealing with technical details that are the subject of standardization. The reviewed technologies and new services are in general compliant with the ITU Recommendations. The handbook also touches on gender perspectives in the preparation and introduction of new services. 3 Why is the handbook necessary The telecommunication sector has gone through radical changes in the last decade, driven by an increasingly global and liberalized market in which the control of network capabilities has become a strategic competitive factor to satisfy increased customer requirements. The fast evolution of network intelligence is mainly driven by the convergence between telecommunications, computers and information technology developing various multimedia services. Due to that, telecommunication networks are becoming and will become increasingly complex and challenging to implement and operate. Moreover, it will be more and more important to possess the competence necessary to integrate high capacity and intelligent solutions into the existing networks to meet enduser and cost efficiency requirements.  Three of the most important requirements that have to be met by the improvement of the existing or newly planned networks are  more capacity,  more power, and  greater efficiency. xii  Report on Question 162 To summarize these driving forces, and also to provide a basis for the subject of the handbook, we can say that  With insufficient capacity e.g. bandwidth, packet volume, etc., network operators cannot satisfy the users demands, even for the universalservice access and especially for new and high quality services. However, in order to optimize the investment, more creativity and appropriate planning of the new technology applications are required.  The opportunity of new technology applications to build up more intelligent capabilities in telecommunication equipment will give more power to network operators and service providers while increasing Intelligent Network traffic, generating new valueadded services. Estimation of customers needs is a powerful tool to win competition, but only if it is done in time.  Development of new network management concepts, comprising operation, administration, maintenance and planning, leads to better operational efficiency and maintenance organization, thereby decreasing operational costs. An objective picture of network elements contained in, networks, services and business will improve daytoday operations and network performance, thus fulfilling customers expectations for higher quality of service as the target.  These reasons have been the leading concepts in developing the material contained in this handbook. 4 Who should read the handbook The handbook is a convenient tool for all those who are interested in telecommunications. It is specially recommended to managers, planning and technical experts of incumbent telecommunication operators as well as national regulators in the telecommunication sector, in particular from developing countries. Those managers should use this information to overview or develop concepts for longterm strategies. Technical managers and experts should extract the deployment of networks that will support the new and global services expected by the 21st century users. Regulators, especially newly established ones, should be supported to create an environment in which innovations by various players can be encouraged without applying constraints other than those needed to create productive competition. Other players will also benefit from the prepared material for improvement of their market access. References listed in the various fascicles of the handbook should enable readers to obtain more information on the subject.  5 Homogeneity Many people have contributed to this handbook which was edited by Ms N. Gospic assisted by Messrs B. Moore and J. Magill. The chapters and subchapters vary in scope and level of detail which is to be expected in such a handbook, reflecting the different nature of the contributions. The handbook represents a snapshot of the development of networks and services as at the time of issue. It is therefore not a complete picture but provides guidelines and many references for further study. It is anticipated that the handbook will be updated as the technologies evolve.   Hamadoun I. Tour Director Telecommunication Development Bureau International Telecommunication Union   Report on Question 162 xiii EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY Report on Question 162 1 Introduction Having regard to future technical and operational trends in telecommunication services, the developing countries need to know about the latest advances made by the international community in this regard, in order to pass on the benefits to their own nationals. The developing countries must keep abreast of developments and achievements in the application of new technologies in telecommunication networks, in order to pass on the benefits of this progress to their users. The handbook on new technologies and new services has been prepared taking into account these two statements of the Valletta Conference held in 1998. 2 Handbook structure The complexity of telecommunication matters, and the different groups of readers, require the handbook structure to follow a certain pedagogical pattern. It is intended that the reader will be able to easily find information on a certain part of a subject. The structure is also adapted to the fast changes in telecommunications and to the fact that some subjects are still under study.  The handbook consists of four parts, which are prepared as separate fascicles Fascicle 1 New technologies supporting new networks Fascicle 2 Digital networks and services Fascicle 3 IPbased networks and services Fascicle 4 Digital radio and television networks and services Each chapter is selfcontained and in some cases subchapters are selfcontained in order to simplify updating of the text. The mention of specific companies in this handbook does not imply any endorsement or recommendation by ITU. In each fascicle there is a Chapter 1 dealing with a general review and links to other fascicles. Relevant ITUT standards and publications are referenced in each of the chapters. Also, some of the important standards from other standardization organizations are listed. In some chapters, useful examples are annexed in order to amplify the subject matter. A brief content of the fascicles as part of the handbook is given below. The detailed table of contents is shown at the beginning of each fascicle. Fascicle 1  New technologies supporting new networks The content of this fascicle is divided into the following chapters 1 Introduction 2 New transport media technologies  Optical fibre cables  Digital radiorelay technologies  Mobile communication systems  Satellite systems xiv  Report on Question 162 3 Digital switching systems 4 New signalling systems and SS No. 7  5 Synchronization techniques and methods 6 Digital transmission 7 ATM Technology Chapter 1  Introduction and general review, discusses the need to implement new technologies in order to introduce new services and be competitive on the market with capacities and quality.

Demand for broadband services, Internet access with the need for high speed data transmission, Video on Demand etc. require significantly increasing capacities in the network, challenging operators of fixed and mobile networks to deploy enhancements to their infrastructures quickly enough to respond for those demands. In addition, operators of narrowband wireless local loop and cellular networks require costeffective transmission feeders to connect their base stations. A powerful infrastructure with appropriate transmission media will enable operators to be prepared for emerging new trends in networks and services. In many cases, the telecommunication infrastructure consists of a mix of different technologies for the successful realization of physical and logical networks.  Optical fibre is recognized as the superior transmission media and consequently has already been in use for a number of years. It supports the development of a new digital hierarchy e.g. the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, SDH. The global demand for optical fibre cables is expected to grow at between 15 to 20 per year over the coming years. Thirty six million fibrekilometres were installed in 1997. Optical fibre deployment started in long distance networks, but the market for optical cables in the local telephone, cable TV and data communication applications continues to grow, more and more rapidly. Optical fibre cables are installed by either burial directly in underground ducts or on poles. The new developments in the field of the Wavelength Division Multiplexing  WDM, have emphasized the role of using optical fibres over long time periods, and demonstrate the possibility of further exploiting the existing fibre optical networks. Thanks to the new techniques, such as optical amplifiers and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing  DWDM, the cost of the network infrastructure is significantly cheaper than in the past. New optoelectronic devices, studied in this Fascicle, will make it possible to build optical networks with high traffic capacities operating at high bit rates several hundred Gbits to Terabits.  However, great progress has also been made in the development of radio technologies, specially, in satellite and cellular technologies, changing dramatically the fields of telecommunication development, universal access and user mobility. In order to facilitate implementation of these different telecommunication technologies the ITU has issued different publications elaborating these matters. This Fascicle, which is a part of the Handbook New Technologies and New Services has such a role.  1.2 Structure of Fascicle 1 Fascicle 1 is divided in 7 Chapters with this Introduction as Chapter 1. Each Chapter is selfcontained apart from Chapter 2 where each subchapter is selfcontained in order to simplify the updating of the text. Chapter 2  New transport media technologies, is divided in four Subchapters Optical Fibres, RadioRelay Systems, Mobile Communication Systems, and Satellite Systems. The first Subchapter, Optical Fibres, deals with the main considerations when deploying optical fibres, discussing transmission properties e.g. Attenuation, Chromatic dispersion, and polarization, fibre types, optical fibre implementation, and protection of optical fibre rings. Digital Radiorelay Systems, as Subchapter 2, deals with developments in digital microwave technologies, multiple access radio systems, and digital radio networks. 2  Report on Question 162 The third Subchapter addresses Mobile Communications Systems including spectrum allocation, existing analogue cellular systems, and the various digital cellular systems. Also discussed are cordless telephony, and the use of satellite systems. The subject of third generation mobile systems is primarily addressed in Fascicle 2. The fourth and final Subchapter, Satellite Systems, discusses the satellite technologies as a special case of radio technology. Satellite systems are similar to radio systems, the only real difference being that the intermediate link station is in orbit. Satellites used for telecommunications purposes are placed in geostationary, medium earth and low earth orbits. The development of global satellite based personal communication systems  GMPCS, is addressing a new market, which has not been exploited by costly conventional mobile satellite systems. The new satellite techniques, such as VSAT, DAMA, TDMA, DCME, are discussed also. As examples, Annexes introduce global satellite systems such as Globstar, ICO, SkyBridge, Teledesic and Final Analysis.  Chapter 3  Digital Switching Systems, deals with technologies for circuit and packet switching, and with SPC switching system organization. The development of SPC technology has made it possible to design nodes with extensive functionality to carry different services. These capabilities are called network intelligence and are the subject of this subchapter. New switching procedures, such as ATM and optical switching, are discussed here also. Chapter 4  studies New signalling Systems and SS No. 7 and is composed of four Subchapters. The Introduction highlights the importance of new signalling systems for network evolution and new services.  Subchapter 2  deals with Signalling System No. 7 with details on the Message Transfer Part MTP, Signalling Connection Control Part SCCP, Transaction Capabilities TC, ISDN User Part ISUP, and the Intelligent Network Application Part INAP.  Subchapter 3  deals with Digital Subscriber Signalling System 1 DSS1. Subchapter 4  evaluates Broadband signalling explaining User Network Interface UNI, Broadband ISDN user Part BISDN, Digital Signalling System Number 2 DSS2 and relevant ITUT Recommendations. Annexes deal with Signalling functions, Other ATM Signalling Protocols, and DSS2 and the ATM Forum UNI signalling specifications. Chapter 5  deals with Synchronization Techniques and Methods with Synchronization of the transmission systems, Phased Locked Loop, Timing correction, Network synchronization, and Synchronization in ATM are elaborated in separate Subchapters.  Chapter 6  deals with transmission technology PDH, SDH, DWDM and xDSL. The Chapter introduces Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, SDH, explaining a SDH frame structure, multiplexing scheme, and SDH management. DWDM, as a new technology offers high transmission rates on fibres and capacity can be increased without laying new cables. In addition Chapter 6 also deals with the new transmission technology for upgrading cooper wire using  Digital Subscriber Line transmission techniques. A number of new technologies, classed as xDSL technologies, offer new approaches to use the existing local networks for higher bit rate services. Chapter 7  deals with ATM technology. ATM frame structure, multiplexing, protocols and management are addressed in detail. The references listed in the chapters should enable readers to get more information on the subjects.  The mention of specific companies or products in this Fascicle does not imply any endorsement or recommendation by the ITU.   Report on Question 162 3 CHAPTER  2  New transport media technologies optical fibres, radio, satellite 2.1 Optical fibres 2.1.1 Transmission properties A typical optical fibre is made up of a central cylindrical part, the core, in which the light is normally travelling, surrounded by an optical cladding used to guide the light into the core, i.e. to maintain as much as possible the optical power inside the core. These two parts, the core and the cladding, are normally made of ultra pure doped silica. For mechanical protection, these two parts are covered by a concentric primary coating made of a plastic material, which is very important for insuring a stable and reliable behaviour. The primary coating is also, in general, marked, i.e. by a colour code for fibre identification. Definitions of these parameters as well as other parameters listed below and the way to measure them can be found on the following publications ITUT Recommendation G.650 Definitions and test methods for the relevant parameters of singlemode fibres. ITUT Recommendation G.651 Characteristics of a 50125 m multimode graded index optical fibre cable. IEC Publication 61931 Fibre optic terminology IEC Publication 607931 Optical fibres  Part 1 Generic specification IEC Publication 607941 Optical cables  Part 1 Generic specification. For singlemode fibres, which are the only ones used for telecommunication applications multimode fibres are used only for Local Area Networks and short distance applications, the main transmission characteristics are the attenuation, the chromatic dispersion, the cutoff wavelength and the polarization mode dispersion. Numerical values related to these parameters which can be found in International Standards or Recommendations are the result of a consensus between the different members at the time of preparation of the Standard. Therefore and considering also the evolution of the technology, it is possible for some parameters to find different values for the best products available on the market. Several fibre parameters, in particular transmission parameters, can be affected by the cabling andor installation. For designing a transmission system, it is essential to consider only fibre parameters of installed cables and therefore, the values given hereafter shall be understood as applicable to cabled fibres. 2.1.1.1 Attenuation Attenuation is defined as 1 A decrease of electromagnetic power between two points. 2 The quantitative expression of power decrease which may be expressed by the ratio of the values at two points of a quantity related to power in a well defined manner. 4  Report on Question 162 Attenuation is certainly one of the most important parameter for an optical fibre as it is the most common limitation of the maximum distance for an optical link. It is normally given as an attenuation coefficient, i.e. attenuation per unit length, and is normally measured around specific wavelengths, 1310 and 1550 nm for standard singlemode fibres. During the last ten to fifteen years, the value of the attenuation coefficient has been continuously reducing due to the evolution of the technology and is now very close of the theoretical minimum value. Maximum attenuation coefficient values specified for cabled fibres are presently 0.5 dBkm 1310 nm and 0.4 dBkm 1550 nm. Values of 0.38 to 0.40 dBkm at 1310 nm and around 0.25 dBkm at 1550 nm can be found on the market. 2.1.1.2 Chromatic Dispersion Chromatic dispersion is The spreading of a light pulse per unit source spectrum width in an optical fibre caused by different group velocities of the different wavelengths composing the source spectrum. NOTE  The chromatic dispersion may be due to the following contributions material dispersion, waveguide dispersion, profile dispersion. It may also limit the maximum distance for an optical link especially for high bit rates which are now used more and more. For the basic singlemode fibres, minimum attenuation is obtained in the 1550 nm window, and minimum chromatic dispersion happens in the 1310 nm window. The try to solve this problem, new types of fibres combining minimum attenuation and reduced chromatic dispersion have been proposed and are discussed in the following chapter. Specified value for G.652B1.1 fibres is presently S0max psnm2  km    0.093. 2.1.1.3 Cutoff Wavelength Cutoff wavelength is defined as The wavelength at which the ratio between the total power, including launching higher order modes, and the fundamental mode power has decreased to less than a specified value, the modes being substantially uniformly excited. NOTE  This specified value is presently chosen to be 0.1 dB. NOTE  The cutoff wavelength depends upon the measurement conditions and in particular on the sample length, its curvature and cabling. NOTE  The cutoff wavelength is generally different from the theoretical cutoff wavelength that can be computed from the refractive index profile of the fibre. The theoretical cutoff wavelength is a less useful parameter for determining fibre performances in a telecommunication network. This parameter is the one that insures the single mode behaviour of the fibre. It can be understood from the note 2 that cutoff wavelength is affected by the cabling process and possibly by installation conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to know deployment conditions of a fibre to evaluate its cutoff wavelength, which must be smaller than the operating wavelength of the system. Indication on the way to choose cutoff wavelength is given in IEC 607932 by the following note In general, there is no unique relationship between the fibre cutoff wavelength  and that of cabled fibre . The necessary value of c for any particular system application depends upon the fibre, cable and system design including system operating bitrate and operating wavelength, together with the expected length and curvatures of repair cables. However, a general relationship may be determined between  and  for particular fibre cable designs. The required value for  is still under study and will be indicated in the product specification on optical cables IEC 607942. For some applications, some users have preferred to set limits for  below the envisaged operating wavelength typical values within the range 11001280 nm have been adopted in such cases. For other applications, some users have chosen to permit  to be as high as 1350 nm, relying on the effects of cable making and installation to yield values below the operating wavelength range.   Report on Question 162 5 2.1.1.4 Polarisation Mode Dispersion Polarization Mode Dispersion PMD is The distortion of the transmitted signal attributable to the different velocities of the polarization components of the same mode and their dependence on wavelength. NOTE  In straight, unstressed circularly symmetric fibres the polarization dispersion is negligible. PMD has been recognized recently as a potential limitation for very high bit rate long haul links. The statistical nature of PMD creates some difficulty for an accurate prediction of its impact on the global link. The consequences of PMD are particularly important for long distance applications as it may impair the performance of a long length and high bit rate fibre optic system e.g. 10 Gbits transport over 100 km. When designing this type of system, it is therefore recommended to use very low PMD fibres to avoid any risk of impairing the global link performance. Recommended PMD value for cabled fibres is presently  0.5 ps.km12. Values  0.2 ps.km12 or lower can be found on the market. 2.1.2 Fibre types For long distance telecommunication applications, only singlemode fibres are used, as they exhibit the lowest attenuation and the highest transmission capability. However, there are different types of singlemode fibres, corresponding to different applications, which are described in the following ITU Recommendations  G.652 Characteristics of a singlemode optical fibre cable G.653 Characteristics of a dispersionshifted singlemode optical fibre cable G.654 Characteristics of a 1550 nm wavelength loss  minimized singlemode optical fibre cable G.655 Characteristics of a nonzero dispersion shifted singlemode optical fibre IEC specifies the fibres according to the following categories B1.1 Dispersion unshifted for operation at 1310 nm B1.2 Loss minimized for operation at 1550 nm B2 Dispersion shifted for operation at 1550 nm B3 Dispersion flattened for operation at 1310 nm and 1550 nm B4 Non zero dispersion for operation at 1550 nm Characteristics of these different categories of fibres are specified in IEC publication 607932 Optical fibres  Part 2  Product specifications. The most common product, in terms of the installed base since the beginning of the singlemode technology, is fibre category B1.1, corresponding to Recommendation G.652. It is presently this fibre which represents the major part of the market due to its capability of providing, at the most attractive cost, good performance adaptable to most of the telecommunication applications. For B1.1 singlemode fibres, minimum attenuation is obtained in the 1550 nm window, and minimum chromatic dispersion happens in the 1310 nm window. It is therefore not possible to achieve at the same time an optimum behaviour from the point of view of both loss and dispersion. Dispersion shifted fibres DSF, category B2 according to Recommendation G.653 have been developed to answer the need for simultaneous optimization, but due to their higher cost linked to a more sophisticated structure, they remain limited to those applications really requiring this extra capability, e.g. for submarine links. Loss minimized fibres category B1.2 corresponding to Recommendation G.654 have been used for some very long links where the attenuation limitation was predominant. 6  Report on Question 162 More recently, it has been recognized that for Wavelength Division Multiplexing WDM applications, an important parameter is the stability of chromatic dispersion for the different wavelengths used. It is for this reason that a new category of fibre category B4, corresponding to Recommendation G.655 called nonzero dispersion fibre NZDSF has been generated. Compared to a DSF, a NZDSF exhibits a higher value of chromatic dispersion at 1550 nm, but the slope of the curve chromatic dispersion vs. frequency is reduced in the operating window, in order to facilitate WDM operation. Standardization of this new category of fibres has been initiated both in the ITU and in the IEC, prompted by decisions of installation in some countries, and some standards values have been agreed upon and published. However, these values provide only a very broad definition and are not sufficient to define precisely a standard product. Several different products, corresponding to different interpretations of the category, can be accommodated within the existing standard and it has not been possible until now to define an agreed set of values leading to a real standard uniform category. According to IEC Publication 607942, which is the most recent publication defining characteristics of fibres, all singlemode fibres have in common several basic parameters such as  cladding diameter 125    2 m  primary coating diameter 245    10 m uncoloured   250    15 m coloured A cladding diameter value of 125    1 m can be found presently, which provides advantages for splicing purposes. However, some other parameters differ from one category to another. For example, mode field diameter is 8.6 to 9.5 m at 1310 nm for B1.1 7.8 to 8.5 m at 1550 nm for B2 6 m at 1310 nm and 7 m at 1550 nm for B3 under consideration for B1.2 and B4. Transmission parameters such as attenuation coefficient and dispersion characteristics are obviously different for the different categories. B1, B2 and B3 categories are more or less completely defined as B4 remains under consideration for most of its parameters. 2.1.3 Optical fibre implementation Optical fibres are normally not used alone but are incorporated in a cable. The purpose of the cable is to protect fibres against mechanical and environmental aggression, but sometimes the cabling and installation processes may impair fibre characteristics if not done properly. Furthermore a single length may not be sufficient and several lengths may need to be spliced together, which requires further consideration of both fibre and cable parameters. The ITUT has already published a series of Recommendations on the subject. The most recent of these are  L.12  0792  Optical fibre joints  L.13  0792  Sheath joints and organizers of optical fibre cables in the outside plant  L.14  0792  Measurement method to determine the tensile performance of optical fibre cables under load  L.15  0393  Optical local distribution networks  Factors to be considered for their construction  L.17  0695  Implementation of connecting customers into the public switched telephone network PSTN via optical fibres   Report on Question 162 7 L.17 App.1  0297  Implementation of connecting customers into the public switched telephone netorks PSTN via optical fibres, Appendix 1 Examples of possible applications  L.20  1096  Creation of a fire security code for telecommunication facilities  L.22  1096  Fire protection  L.23  1096  Fire extinction  Classification and location of fire extinguishing installations and equipment on premises  L.25  1096  Optical fibre cable network maintenance  L.26  1096  Optical fibre cables for aerial application  L.27  1096  Method for estimating the concentration of hydrogen in optical fibre cables  L.28  1096  External additional protection for marinized terrestrial cables  L.29  1096  Aslaid report and maintenancerepair log for marinized terrestrial cable installation  L.30  1096  Markers on marinized terrestrial cables  L.34  1098  Installation of Optical Fibre Ground Wire OPGW cable  L.35  1098  Installation of optical fibre cables in the access network  2.1.3.1 Fibre protection The first level of protection is provided by the primary coating. The selection of the primary coating is of paramount importance for insuring the reliability of the fibre. A good primary coating should protect the fibre against mechanical stress, abrasion, etc., as well as environmental and chemical effects such as humidity for instance. It should not create microbending that can happen if it is not applied concentric to the silica material, should make fibre handling easy and should be easily removable for splicing purposes. Furthermore, the primary coating in general also provides identification means through a colour code. It should be adapted to this function and the coloured fibber should keep the same characteristics as an uncoloured one. Compatibility between primary coating and the colours used should be demonstrated after production and also for the operating lifetime of the fibre. Stability of colour identification is also needed, as well as compatibility with all the constitutive materials of the cable. All these requirements show the high level of technology required for the development and implementation of a good primary coating. In practice, it is not possible to continuously maintain fibres free of stress during their operating lifetime. Some level of stress can be applied, either continuously or for a short time period. It is therefore necessary to consider this situation and to evaluate the consequences on the fibres. One obvious consequence, when stress is applied to the fibre exceeding some level which is function of cable structure, is a degradation of transmission characteristics, in particular the attenuation coefficient. This issue is therefore quite easy to understand by submitting the cable to appropriate tests.  Another consequence, which cannot be detected immediately but is also very important, is a reduction of expected fibre lifetime, if the fibre is submitted to a stress exceeding some value as described hereafter. This point requires more attention as the result is not directly measurable. The ability of a fibre to survive mechanical constraints is given by the knowledge of the stress corrosion susceptibility parameters. Definitions and measurement methods for static and dynamic parameters ns and nd respectively, which are both used in practice, are given in IEC Publication 6079313. The lifetime of a fibre under operational conditions is linked to its value of ns and nd the bigger ns and nd are, the longer is the expected fibre lifetime for given conditions.  8  Report on Question 162 The purpose of the cable is to reduce the level of stress transfer to the fibre itself, due to environment during the operational life of the system, but the above rule related to the n values is always valid it means that, for a given external stress, if different cable structures transfer differently stress to fibre, the less it transfers, the better it is. But, for a given level of stress on fibre, any increase on the n value will increase the fibre lifetime.  Values of ns  20 and nd  25, shown presently by many products can insure, under normal conditions and based on commonly accepted theoretical calculations, a satisfactory minimum lifetime. Higher values will provide a longer expected lifetime. The second level of protection is provided by the cable itself. Parameters for optical cables and the way to measure them are given in IEC Publication 607941 Optical fibre cables  Part 1 Generic specification. In particular, the lifetime aspect, as mentioned above, is linked to the absence of microbending on the fibre which can be characterized by a thermal cycling test see IEC Publication 6079412. The evaluation of the cable behaviour for stress parameters such as tension, crush, impact, bending, torsion, needs also to be done, according to operational requirements. The same reference as above IEC Publication 6079412 applies. 2.1.3.2 Installation procedures It is important to keep unaltered, by using convenient installation procedures, the characteristics of optical fibre cables. Useful information can be found in the informative Annex C of IEC Publication 6079411. The introduction of this document summarizes its main points as follows Optical fibre cables are designed so that normal installation practices and equipment can be used wherever possible. They do, however, generally have a strain limit rather lower than metallic conductor cables and in some circumstances, special care and arrangements may be needed to ensure successful installation. It is important to pay particular attention to the cable manufacturers recommendations and stated physical limitations, and not exceed the given cable tensile load rating for a particular cable. Damage caused by overloading during installation may not be immediately apparent but can lead to failure later in its service life. 2.1.3.3 Splicing For the purpose of optical cable splicing, two types of characteristics need to be considered  those related to the fibre and those related to the cable structure. Concerning the fibre, splicing losses increase with higher tolerances. A reduction of tolerances on cladding diameter to  1 m as mentioned above will reduce splice loss. A similar result can be achieved by reducing the tolerance on mode field diameter, 2w0 the specified value is  1 m and it is possible to achieve values of  10.5 m or lower. Fibre handling for splicing is characterized by fibre curl see IEC Publication 6079313. The radius of fibre curl, r, has to be as great as possible and there is a general consensus that a minimum of 2 meters is required. Greater values can be found on the market. The cable structure is also of interest, considering parameters such as modularity, possibility of easy access to fibres sheath or tube removal, identification of fibres in the cable structure colour code, stability of colour over time.   Report on Question 162 9 In conclusion, it is clear that optical fibre implementation is governed by a large number of parameters. Some parameters of general interest have been reviewed but it is also important to know precisely the conditions applicable for the operation of the network, during its installation and over its operational lifetime, in order to select the most relevant conditions for the protection of fibres. 2.1.4 Protection of Optical Networks 2.1.4.1 Introduction Survivability is arguably one of the most important factors in the evaluation and design of fibre optic telecommunication networks. This happens as more traffic is carried by the same fibre infrastructure and more telecommunications service customers are likely to be served by bigger central offices. The evolution of transport networks towards a two layer WDM  SDH has increased even further the emphasis on survivability. 2.1.4.2 Network Survivability Network survivability is the ability of the network to recover traffic in the event of a failure of a network component, such as the complete loss of a transmission link or the failure of a central office. The main objective of network survivability is to guarantee a certain traffic service level agreement.  Traffic survivability enhancement is achieved by the replacement of failed or degraded transport entities. The replacement is normally initiated by the detection of a defect, performance degradation or an external management request. The main characteristic of the protection mechanisms as standardized in ITUT Recommendations like G.841 and G.842 is that they are able to recover traffic very quickly, for most of them, the target is to protect the traffic in less than 50 ms. Further, protection also operates autonomously from the network operation centre. Protection makes use of preassigned capacity between the nodes. The simplest protection architecture has one dedicated protection entity for each working entity 1  1. The most complex architecture has m protection entities shared amongst n working entities mn. The following protection mechanisms were entirely defined in ITUT recommendations 2.1.4.2.1 SNCPI Subnetwork Connection Protection with Inherent monitoring This protection mechanism uses 1  1 architecture, which means it needs a spare subnetwork connection to protect a working subnetwork protection. It is single ended that is both directions of traffic are protected independently. The faults under which SNCPI is able to react and protect are those due to hard failures, occurring as equipment failure, optical interface failures and link failures. Radio link short period interruptions initiating Tributary Unit  Alarm Indication Signal TU AIS or Tributary Unit  Loss of Power TU LOP will also cause SNCPI to protect. SNCPI may be implemented on a VC per VC basis allowing a given transmission facility to transport unprotected traffic and protected traffic.  2.1.4.2.2 SNCPN Subnetwork Connection Protection with Non intrusive Monitoring This protection mechanism differs from the previous one, only in the fault conditions under which it is able to protect. SNCPN protects against the usual hard failures as described for SNCPI but it also protects against failures such as human related activities, operating system mismanagement or misprovisioning. These types of failures could be originated by a wrong matrix connection or opening of connections. Further, SNCPN also protects against soft failures due to degradation of optical interfaces or to errors occurring in a radio link exceeding the predetermined threshold value for maximum acceptable BER. 10  Report on Question 162 2.1.4.2.3 MS Linear Trail Protection This is a bulk traffic protection mechanism able to protect against fibre cuts, optical interface failures, as well as against performance degradation of optical interfaces and fibre. MS Linear trail protection supports many types of architectures, which may be 1  1 or 1N. The bandwidth made available for protection may be used to transport low priority traffic when all the working spans are faultless. MS Linear Trail Protection can be also used to protect spans in linear or chained type of networks. 2.1.4.2.4 MSSPRING Multiplex Section Shared Protected Ring  MSSPRING is also a bulk traffic protection mechanism able to protect against fibre cuts, optical interface failures, as well as against performance degradation of optical interfaces and fibre. However, MSSPRING is a protection mechanism that needs a network ring physical topology to work. One of the major advantages of MSSPRING with respect to other protection mechanisms, is its ability to reuse bandwidth capacity which makes it the most efficient protection mechanism available under conditions of uniformly distributed traffic. MSSPRINGs in general are considered to be appropriate in areas of the network where the traffic is uniformly distributed.  There is also a variation of the MSSPRING implementation in G.841 to optimize it for long distance applications, like submarine networks or backbone networks in large countries, where the distance between nodes can be many thousands of kilometres long. During network failures and while maintenance is taking place, the path under protection can be much longer than in normal operation as ring switches take place adjacent to the network failure. This translates into longer voice transit delay which can constitute an impairment to the conversation fluidity over a long distance PSTN network. To limit this degradation of voice quality, the MSSPRING functionality has been enhanced to what is called MSSPINGs for long distance applications and it is described in Annex A of ITUT G.841 2.1.4.2.5 Restoration Restoration makes use of any capacity available between nodes to recover traffic against network failures. In general the algorithms used for restoration will involve rerouting. When restoration is used some percentage of the transport network capacity will be reserved for rerouting working traffic. As yet, restoration has not been standardized, the several products currently available in the market respond to a number of specific customer specifications. Restoration is the most efficient traffic availability enhancement technique if the network physical topology is reasonably well meshed. For example, when the network nodes are reachable through at least three or even better more disjoint physical routes, the amount of spare bandwidth devoted to spare capacity of around 33 or less per span would be enough to restore against single span failures. This is in comparison with the 50 of spare capacity required by the ring protection mechanisms explained above. The centralised operating system has all the knowledge about traffic distribution, spare capacity, and traffic profiling in function of their priority to be recovered. Depending on the nature of the failure, the restoration mechanism can administer the use of working traffic and other low priority traffic while restoring the higher priority traffic. This feature is called traffic preemption. Restoration response is slower than protection due to its high versatility in recovering traffic and its bandwidth efficiency. Centralised automatic restoration mechanisms are able to recover traffic in a time range between 5 to 10 secs without incurring unavailability on traffic for the affected circuits. 2.1.4.3 Selection criteria to chose restoration or protection To implement cost effective network architectures, ring protection mechanisms and mesh restoration mechanisms should be used together. It is important to understand that these are not possible alternatives for implementation of reliable networks, but they complement each other very well due to their   Report on Question 162 11 differences and thus should be used together. The criteria for choosing one or other needs to take into account the distribution of fibre and stations in the field. Physical node connectivity is defined as the average number of diversely routed links that arrive to a node central office. This varies significantly depending on the demographic conditions. In general densely populated areas are served by a well connected or meshed network infrastructure. Less densely populated areas tend to have less fibre, with network topologies made up of long chains or large rings. Finally for very low population density, radio and very little fibre constitutes a cost effective way to provide telecommunication services.  In the cases where the connectivity of the nodes in the network is high enough, for instance higher than 3, the use of meshed restoration can be more appropriate as it is possible to exploit all its virtues. These include its minimum utilisation of spare bandwidth in the network, flexibility of growth and preemption.  Most countries have both densely populated areas with a correspondingly wellmeshed network to support it, and areas more sparsely populated correspondingly with less fibre connectivity.  Hence, it is possible to state that meshed protection and ring protection can be efficiently used complementing each other to construct reliable high capacity network architectures. The figure below illustrates this concept which follows the above mentioned criteria of demographic distribution and telecommunication infrastructure required to serve the population.  Figure 2.1.1    Typical fibre and note distribution           Typica l fibre and nodes d is tribution in  function of the popu lation            and the  recom m ended protection and resto ration m echanism s M edium  density  o f population  H igh  density  o f population Low  density  o f population  R ing B ased P rotection  R ing B ased   P rotection M esh B ased R estoration  L inear B ased   P rotection Eventual c losure Eventual c losure     2.1.4.4  Conclusions A number of economical considerations exist for planning and implementing reliable transport network architectures. High availability transport networks have the merit to support cost effectively a complete range of services and their associated quality. Reliable networks incur in much lower operational expenses on maintenance. As maintenance actions can be deferred and lumped, hence there is much more possibility to plan them better.  12  Report on Question 162 Furthermore, the only way to take advantage, safely, of the evolution of the high capacity TDM and WDM systems is to plan for a selfhealing network architecture. Mesh restoration and ring protection mechanisms help construct reliable networks. Studies indicate that ring protection mechanisms are the perfect solution for a poorly interconnected network infrastructure found in medium populated areas.  Restoration with its flexibility and economy of spare bandwidth resources is the best solution to be used with a well interconnected network infrastructure, which is usually found in densely populated areas. As most countries have areas with high, medium and low density population, a combination of mesh restoration, ring and linear protection respectively constitute the right solution to build reliable transport network architectures for the next century. 2.1.4.5 ITUT References For more details in planning optical networks and their protection, the following ITUT Recommendations are important G.872 Architecture of optical transport networks G.709 Network Node Interface for the Optical Transport  G.691 Optical interfaces for multichannel systems G.959.1 Optical transport networks physical layer interfaces G.871 Framework of optical transport network  G.798 Functional characteristics of optical networking equipment G.874 Planned Management of optical network elements G.875 Planned Information model for optical network equipment 2.1.5 Abbreviations BER Bit Error Rate DSF Dispersion Fibre MS  Multiplex Section MSSPRING Multiplex Section  Shared Protected Ring NZDSF NonZero Dispersion Fibre PMD Polarization Mode Dispertion PSTN Public Switched Telephone Network SDH Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SNCPI Subnetwork Connection Protection with Inherent monitoring SNCPN Subnetwork Connection Protection with Nonintrusive monitoring TU AIS Tributary Unit  Alarm Indication Signal TU LOS Tributary Unit  Loss of Power WDM Wavelength Division Multiplexing   Report on Question 162 13 2.2 Digital radiorelay systems 2.2.1 General Digital radiorelay systems DRRS are used in many applications ranging from transporting telephone and TV signals to carrying a wide variety of modern data signals. Distances bridged may range from less than a kilometre to a continent or beyond. Similarly, the capacity of a digital radio system may be as little as a single DS1 signal 1.54 Mbits or as large as 1,000 Mbits. Only a small range of the electromagnetic spectrum is suitable for radiorelay applications and within this range only a limited number of bands are available. The bands are further subdivided into channels that can carry either low capacity or high capacity digital signals. The growth of digital networks was dictated for more than thirty years by the conversion of voice telephone traffic from analogue to digital. Not until recently has pure data traffic been an important factor. Data traffic is now increasingly generated by voice band modems, ISDN terminals, video conferencing and high quality television terminals and other data sources. The advantages of digital radiorelay systems include  Low costs  Radio is costeffective in comparison with other alternative systems like copper and fibre optic cable. The installation of cable and the cable itself can be very expensive and in urban areas it may be difficult to acquire the necessary rightsofway.  Rapid deployment  Radio equipment can be easily moved to new sites to meet rapidly evolving network requirements. Infrastructure requirements are small.  Ease of maintenance  Maintenance is limited to the infrequent radio stations along the radio path in contrast to cable system where the entire path is exposed to potential cable breaks. Spectrum The ITU conducts periodic international conferences, the World Radiocommunication Conferences or WRCs, where the electromagnetic spectrum is allocated to various users. Regional Radiocommunication Conferences RRCs are also held to develop agreements covering the use of the RF spectrum at the regional level. The results are published in the Radio Regulations as the ITU Table of Frequency Allocations, which cover the spectrum from 9 kHz to 400 GHz. In addition to the fixed terrestrial and fixedsatellite services of concern here the spectrum is allocated to many other users like mobile land, aeronautical, maritime, broadcast, sound, TV meteorological, space operation, research, intersatellites Earth exploration radio astronomy, amateur and radiodetermination radar. The Radio Regulations RR allocate the spectrum in only the broadest possible terms. Most of the countries use the RR as the basis for their own national frequency tables in which they provide additional details, segregated into government and nongovernment usage. The ITUR Recommendations may not always reflect the latest channel arrangements used in individual countries. New channel initiatives often start in a particular country and are recognized only some time later in an ITUR Recommendation. If a manufacturer plans to supply radio equipment into a foreign market it is therefore necessary to become familiar with that countrys particular developments. A country may also allow a nonstandard channel arrangement or open up a government frequency band to nongovernment use.  In relation with ITUR Recommendations Fseries, we can take into account the general frequency band arrangements for radiorelay systems a 1.4, 2, 4, 5, L6, U6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 GHz b 18, 23, 27, 31, 38 and 55 GHz 14  Report on Question 162 Digital radio systems operating below 15 GHz are essential in providing junction and backbone links in the long haul and regional networks. They are also used in remote areas or over difficult terrain and are thus complementary to other transmission systems like optical fibre. Congestion in the bands below 15 GHz makes it often impossible to increase the number of links in an area. That is why the bands above 15 GHz become more and more important. In many countries equipment operating above 15 GHz is being deployed in large numbers for shortrange access networks SDH spurs, LAN, temporary links, and cable protection and for mobile network infrastructure e.g. GSM, AMPS, DCS 1800. Digital channel capacity The bit rates carried by digital radiorelay systems are the rates standardized in ITUT Recommendations G.702, G.703 and G.704 for the plesiochronous digital hierarchies and in ITUT Recommendations G.707, G.708 and G.709 for the synchronous digital hierarchies SDH or SONET. According to the ITU Recommendations, and depending on the channel bandwidth and the modulation 4 QAM, 16 QAM, 256 QAM, 512 QAM, the capacity of digital radiorelay systems in bit rates fb includes multiples of DS1 1.544 Mbits and DS3 44.736 Mbits, E1 2.048 Mbits and E3 34.368 Mbits, STS1 or SubSTM1 51.84 Mbits and STM1 155.52  Mbits. These are the bit rates delivered to and from the digital radio. Inside the digital radio system the bit rate fbr is often about 6 higher fbr  1.06 fb because of the addition of forward error correction FEC and the addition of extra overhead bits for internal radio maintenance and to achieve the radiointernal multiplexing of several standard bit streams. 2.2.2 New Digital Microwave Pointto Point Radio Technologies In the remaining part of this section, some of the fields where new technology has appeared over the last few years will be treated in some detail. These technologies are incorporated in new Digital Microwave Radio DMR SDH Synchronous Data Hierarchy equipment, and will ensure a smooth transition from the currently prevailing Plesiochronous Data Hierarchy PDH architecture.  FEC Forward Error Correction and Coded Modulation Techniques In the original and conventional DRRS design, the FEC coding and modulation functions are done independently. Several types of error correction techniques are in use, such as block coding and convolutional coding. In an FEC block coding scheme, the input data stream to be encoded is divided into k information symbols together with redundant parity or check symbols to produce a coded work of n symbols which are then modulated and transmitted. An independent block code encoder operating in this way is producing a n,k or rate kn block code. At the receiver, the demodulated bitstream is first decoded to extract the information bits, which are corrected, if necessary, by the parity or control bits. In an FEC convolutional coding scheme, parity or control bits are calculated over a span of bits to form a continuous bit stream. Convolutional coding is also described in terms of n and k. Here, n is the number of coded bits that are used to make a certain bit sequence, and k is the span of bits that makes the sequence. k is called the constraint length. Convolutional coding is usually designed for specific decoders, such as Viterbi decoding, sequential decoding or syndrome decoding. In coded modulation, the FEC coding and modulation functions are combined by inserting redundant bits in multistate numbers of the transmitted signal constellation. The most popular coded modulation techniques traditionally used for terrestrial digital microwave radio systems are 1 Block Coded Modulation BCM, 2 Trellis Coded Modulation TCM, and 3 Multilevel Coded Modulation MLCM. Of these techniques, the MLCM technology has seen the most rapid advancement in recent years. BCM modulation schemes achieve a lower coding gain than TCM schemes. Coding gain in dB may be defined as maintaining the same BER on a radio link even if the CN is reduced. Thus, if a certain modulation scheme has a coding gain of, for example, 3 dB, the CN can be reduced by 3 dB for the same BER. BCM schemes, however, are simpler than TCM schemes to implement, and may be used in parallel demodulation configurations.    Report on Question 162 15 TCM modulation schemes use convolutional coding techniques which require a smaller bandwidth for a given transmission rate and BER probability. The demodulator used for a TCM scheme is often implemented with Viterbi algorithms in a Maximum Likelihood Sequence Estimation MLSE circuit. The complexity of TCM schemes can be quite high, but they may have a high degree of flexibility. The characteristics of TCM schemes are such that their coding gain on a nonlinear channel is greater than on a linear channel. This advantage of TCM will reduce residual BER for high complexity modulation schemes. In MLCM each modulation level is considered to be a separate communications channel, and different FEC coding schemes may be applied to different levels. Furthermore, one MLCM scheme is not restricted to one coding scheme. For example, some levels may use block codes while other levels may employ convolutional coding. This means flexibility in selecting coding rates since they can be selected separately for individual levels. Figure 2.2.1. shows the basic techniques for TCM and MLCM schemes. In the MLCM case, the incoming serial bitstream is speed converted and changed from serial to parallel mode. Encoder 1 will, for example, apply FEC bits to the Least Significant Bit LSB at a rate R  34 i.e. a total of four bits are transmitted for every three information bits, and Encoder 2 may apply FEC bits to the second LSB at a rate of R  1112 12 transmitted bits for every 11 information bits. After this encoding process, the encoder outputs are paralleltoserial converted and combined with the remaining bit levels in a mapping circuit before being sent to the 128 QAM modulator. Because of the lowering of the operational speed of the coding and decoding processes, a more reliable and robust circuit design is realized.  Figure 2.2.1    Basic concepts of TCM and MLCM techniques     16  Report on Question 162 In the example of Figure 2.2.1 the total MLCM coding redundancy is only about 5 8084. This has the advantage that an additional 2 Mbits channel can be transmitted socalled Wayside channel. This advantage is absent in TCM, where for example in 4dimensional TCM the coding redundancy is 8 and therefore cannot sustain a Wayside channel.  Cross Polarization Interference Canceller XPIC Techniques The frequency bands used in digital microwave radio systems as well as in other radio communications systems are limited resources, and therefore should be utilized in the most effective way possible. Increasing the level of modulation as described in the previous section is one way to increase the capacity of a given system. Another way to increase the use of a given frequency band is to use it twice in the same system by transmitting RF carriers with different polarizations. Cochannel dual polarization equipment has been in operation in commercial satellite systems for many years, but only more recently has it been introduced into terrestrial microwave systems. The reason for this is that satellite systems are rarely operated below antenna elevation angles of 5 degrees and propagation fading is not a critical issue. Terrestrial microwave systems, however, are inherently susceptible to severe fading because they are transmitting parallel to the surface of the earth, and crosspolarization discrimination XPD, i.e. interference of signals between the two polarizations, is highly affected by multipath fading RF carriers.  Figure 2.2.2 shows the expected XPD vs. fading depths. The data shown in this figure are for an antenna designed for high crosspolarization discrimination. As shown, under nonfading conditions an XPDo XPD in normal condition of 35 dB may be expected.  Figure 2.2.2    Expected crosspolarization vs. fading depth        Report on Question 162 17 In order to maintain the XPD between the two polarizations even under fading conditions, equipment developers have turned their attention to designing antennas with increased XPD characteristics about the antenna boresight and crosspolarization interference cancellers XPIC utilizing transversal equalizing technology. Since terrestrial systems often transmit several RF carriers simultaneously, adjacent channel interference should be addressed at the same time by proper filter designs with sharp cutoff characteristics. A 256 QAM system, for example, will improve the band efficiency from approximately 7 bitsHz to 14 bitsHz. The XPIC circuit takes samples of the interfering signals and applies them to the desired signals for cancellation of the interference. The cancellation may be done at either RF, IF or at the baseband level. The complexity of the XPIC circuitry increases with multilevel coded modulation schemes, and systems that employ 256 QAM and 512 QAM modulation states call for very sophisticated XPIC designs. The benefits to be gained, however, are very reliable communications links even in the face of severe fading. Due to controlled imperfections in the antennas, some interference will be expected in the IF signals. The vertically polarized carrier will have interference from the horizontally polarized carrier, and vice versa. The amount of interference is dependent on the antenna XPD and the amount of fading. In the absence of fading, the interference is minimum and acceptable. Figure 2.2.3 shows the improvement that can be expected in XPD performance by using cross polarization interference canceller circuits. This figure indicates measured results for a system employing 128 QAM modulation techniques at a constant BER rate of 1  103 under flat fading conditions. The expected improvement is approximately 20 dB.  Figure 2.2.3    Measured XPD improvement by using XPIC equipment       Automatic Transmission Power Control ATPC Inclusion of automatic transmission power control ATPC circuitry in DMR systems will reduce interference particularly between channels on the same route and between channels transmitted from the same system site. By using ATPC, several advantages are accomplished, including 1 reduction in angular separation between adjacent radial routes, 2 reduction in the distant interference between hops which reuse the same frequency, 3 reduction of interference between adjacent digital and analogue channels that share the same frequency band. 18  Report on Question 162 Further equipment related advantages by using ATPC are realized, including 4 reduction in the DC power consumed by the RF amplifier. This reduction may be quite significant up to 40, 5 improvement in the residual BER performance typical 1  1013,  The dynamic range of ATPC circuits is typically between 12 dB and  2 dB in controlled steps of 1 dB with fading tracking speed of 100 dBsec, and the threshold level of the received signal may be preset in a range between 50 dBm and 70 dBm.  Equalizers for Counteracting Multipath Fading Multipath fading is of major concern on most DMR links implemented in the world. Traditionally, the adverse effects of multipath fading have been mitigated by installing redundant equipment operating in space diversity or frequency diversity configurations. Another way to combat the effects of multipath fading is to use adaptive equalizers in time or frequency domains. Recent technological advances have improved the performance of these equalizer circuits quite significantly, which is particularly important for DMR systems that use multi level coded modulation schemes.  Adaptive equalizers may be implemented at the IF or baseband levels, and the most common circuits in use are the socalled decision feedback equalizers DFE and linear transversal equalizers. Fading effects on a digital radio link are often depicted as a system signature, which is a static indication of the susceptibility of equipment to a two ray model of the multipath channel in both minimum phase and nonminimum phase conditions. It is often used for the purpose of equipment comparison. Due to the dynamic nature of multipath fading, dynamic tests should be performed on the equipment. This is often done by using a dynamic simulator that can simulate the time sequences of multipath fading. Such simulation tests are used for optimization of synchronization and equalizer coefficient adapter circuits. Figure 2.2.4. shows the measured signature of a 64 QAM 155 Mbits digital radio system with decision feedback circuits included. The ability of equalization against minimum phase fading of the linear equalizer is the same as that against nonminimum phase fading. In contrast to that, the adaptive time domain equalizer shown in Figure 2.2.4 equalizes minimum phase fading completely and it is possible to equalize severe fading in which the reflective wave becomes bigger than the main signal. 2.2.3 A modern SDH system utilising new technologies1 Longhaul digital microwave radio systems have been recommended by the ITUT in 1988 to adopt Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH configuration, in an effort to synchronize equipment over wider geographical areas. SDH systems are thus taking over from Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy PDH systems which have been in operation for a number of years. SDH equipment should be designed and implemented with a smooth transition from PDH in mind.  1 See more about SDH principles in Chapter 6.   Report on Question 162 19  Figure 2.2.4    Measured signature of 64 QAM 155 Mbits system with DFE       SDH systems generally operate in frequency bands between 4 and 13 GHz using 64 or 128 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation QAM and have transmission capacity of Synchronous Transmit Module 1 STM1. They can be accommodated in existing RF frequency channel slots vacated by PDH systems. 20  Report on Question 162 A modern SDH digital microwave radio system should include features that make it easy to operate and maintain, and which make the most effective use of the available RF bandwidth. New technological advancements as outlined in this book should be included to the extent possible. Features that should be implemented include  Conformity with the latest international standards, specifically ITUR, ITUT and ETS standards.  Protection against fading such as Frequency Diversity FD andor Space Diversity SD switching. Furthermore, the system should be traffic capacity expandable preferably by simply adding equipment modules.   The system gain should be high by using receivers with low noise figures. In systems utilizing FD andor SD protection switching, the switching should not result in any drastic reduction in Bit Error Rate BER performance.  MultiLevel Coding Modulation MLCM should be used in order to ensure improved effectiveness and performance. Coding gain should be optimized and coding redundancy should be minimized to enable insertion of additional 2.048 or 1.544 Mbits service channels in the Radio Frame Complementary Overhead RFCOH field.  Automatic Transmit Power Control ATPC should be considered in order to reduce interference to neighbouring systems, improvement of the residual BER performance, alleviation of fading problems, and reduction in power consumption.  Decision Feedback Equalizers DFE or other suitable equalization schemes should be included in order to reduce inband dispersive amplitude and delay distortion caused by multipath fading.  Two different external synchronization clocks should be available for redundancy purposes. This should be in addition to an internal oscillator clock.  The SDH system should be capable of being integrated into existing PDH baseband networks. Upgrading of the interface to STM1 transmission should be software selectable.   The Section Overhead SOH should preferably be terminated in two directions, i.e. not only for the radio section but also for the electrical or optical line section which is terminated at the radio station.  The system should be equipped with an electrical or an optical STM1 interface for each channel. The optical interface should be available for two or more different cable lengths for intraoffice and long haul interoffice applications.  In addition to the STM1 or 140 Mbits main traffic stream, several Digital Service Channels DSC, and depending on the MLCM scheme used, one or two additional 2.048 or 1.544 Mbits service channels should be dropped and inserted at every terminal and repeater radio station. These channels should be transported in the RFCOH.  Extensive performance monitoring and control functions should be built into the equipment. Such parameters should be in conformance with ITUT G.784. Furthermore, a count should be kept of the number of protection switchover operations, and an account of the failed time for individual channels. Such functions should preferably be performed from a Network Management System NMS.   In order to enhance the reliability of the equipment and extend the MTBF figure, extensive use of LSI Microwave Integrated Circuits MIC and Hybrid IC HIC should be implemented. Furthermore, lowpower highspeed Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor CMOS LSI should be used wherever possible in order to make the equipment more compact and reduce the power consumption.   Equipment should be installed in standard racks with room for expansion, and should be able to operate over a wide range of environmental conditions.  The equipment should be flexible and should be reconfigurable.   Report on Question 162 21  Orderwire communications should preferably be implemented with a priority orderwire and an omnibus orderwire using SOH bytes E2 and E1, respectively. The orderwire channels should provide voice communications throughout the entire SDH radio network using selective calling facilities by means of Dual Tone Multifrequency DTMF signalling.  Management features should be designed in accordance with, amongst others, ITUT Recommendations of the M.3000 series and G.784. This enables interconnection to TMNbased Network Management System NMS from various vendors by means of the socalled Q3 interface see more information see Fascicle 2, Chapter 5 Network and Service Management. 2.2.4 Multiple Access Radio Systems Despite the fact that people all over the world are crowding into metropolitan or urban areas in ever increasing numbers, the major part of the worlds population is still living in rural areas and to a large extent has the same aspirations and requirements for telecommunications services as their counterparts in the big cities. Such rural population is often spread thinly over vast geographical areas. National telecommunication organizations that have been charged with providing communications to all areas of a country have traditionally not had many options available to them, and particularly not for providing highgrade services like television and highspeed data communications. Often, the only choice has been a pair of copper wires. With the advent of highpowered satellites in recent years, VSAT Very Small Aperture Terminal systems can be used for providing highspeed data and television services to rural areas. Such systems may be established quickly and rather inexpensively per terminal. However, VSAT systems are normally looked upon as low capacity facilities, and covering a vast thinly populated area with VSAT terminals may be an expensive proposition. Widespread inexpensive handheld satellite telephone sets operating with Low or Medium Earth Orbit LEOMEO satellites are still a few years away, and in any case the initial costs and running and operating costs of such devices may put them out of reach for many rural areas see more details in subchapter 2.4 Satellite Systems of this Fascicle. As an alternative for rural communications, multiple access subscriber radio communication systems may be considered as an attractive solution. One such system employing modern digital technology may be implemented with up to approximately 1000 subscriber lines spread over a radius of about 1000 km from one base station. That is more than 3000 square kilometres per subscriber, and in terms of economy and services provided, such a system may compete with VSAT systems and LEOMEO handheld satellite telephone sets.  2.2.4.1 System Architecture A subscriber radio system consists of three major elements, namely the base station, repeater stations and terminal subscriber stations. A system may be implemented in a homogeneous configuration typical of an urban system, or in a linear configuration typical of a rural system. These systems operate in the 1.52.4 GHz frequency bands and typically use TDM Time Division Multiplexing technology with 60 time slots for 1024 subscribers in the downward direction i.e. from the base station to the subscribers, and TDMA Time Division Multiple Access technology in the upward direction. Voice channels are encoded at 64 kbits Pulse Code Modulation PCM. Such a system is often referred to as a Digital Radio Multiple Access Subscriber Systems DRMASS. In newer systems the voice coding is done at 32 kbits Adaptive Differential PCM and the number of time slots is approximately doubled.  A subscriber radio system is constructed with cells in a honeycomb configuration, not unlike cellular radio systems for mobile users. Figure 2.2.5 shows the basic concept of subscriber radio system and Figure 2.2.6 is an example of a typical cell arrangement and frequency allocations for a 14channel DRMASS system. The base station is typically located at the same site as a metropolitan or urban telephone exchange for easy interface of the DRMASS circuits into the national telephone network. The interface may be either digital for example at 2 Mbits or 2wire analogue circuits. Each cell in the DRMASS system has radio transmit and receive equipment for passing calls on to the next cell or for communicating with subscribers under its jurisdiction. 22  Report on Question 162 The subscriber equipment in a DRMASS system includes multiline subscriber units for locations with several subscribers grouped together, and mini terminals for locations with a single or two subscribers in one location.  In technology recently developed, a cell in the DRMASS system may be included for mobile andor fixed users. Such a cell is referred to as a Digital Cordless Telephone System DCTS cell and is used for communicating with cordless telephone sets or small fixed terminals at 32 kbits ADPCM Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation.  Figure 2.2.5    Digital radio multiple access subscriber system basic concept      In DRMASS systems each cell repeater station can cover an area up to a radius of approximately 45 km, and a DCTS cell can communicate with fixed terminals at a radius of approximately 3 km.  A DRMASS system provides its services by concentrating a large number of subscriber lines into available time slots, and the system is normally transparent to signalling to and from the subscribers. The telephone channels coming from the local telephone exchange are concentrated and converted to digital signals and transmitted down to the nearest repeater and onwards to other repeaters if applicable. Each repeater will communicate with its subscriber from an omni directional antenna. One time slot among the 60 slots is automatically assigned to the subscriber making a call. For the upward transmission from the subscriber via a repeater station to the base station, the subscriber is assigned a time slot and his transmission is in burst mode TDMA without any risk of overlapping with other subscribers. Only one pair of frequencies is used for upward and downward transmissions. In Figure 2.2.7 the overall frame format for one frame is shown together with the various fields of information in the frame. Figure 2.2.8 shows a typical format for one subscriber time slot channel socalled Vchannel.    Report on Question 162 23  Figure 2.2.6    Example of cell arrangement and frequency allocations for 14 channels      The radio frame consists of 60 voice channels V CH, one control channel C CH, one supervisory channel SV CH, one orderwire channel OW CH, one telegraph channel TELEX CH, one acquisition and local maintenance channel ACQLOCAL CH, and a frame synchronization pattern F, F. The frame period is 4 msec, and the frame pattern is allocated 7 bits in the leading section of both the C CH and the ACQLOCAL CH channels. The first part of the leading section is a fixed word of 5 bits and the remaining 2 bits is a variable word ID NO.. These words are used to discriminate between the routes, and as frame identification. Identifications of every 16 frames are done by a test module. The polarity of the ACQLOCAL CH and the C CH is inverted in the fixed word and this polarity alternates at intervals of 2 msec. Frame synchronization uses a one bit shift hunting method, and synchronizing protection is achieved by 3 continuous yes4 continuous no pulses. Each V CH, OW CH and SV CH has 152 bits for both upward and downward signal flows and consists of the actual data for example 64K voice and control information. In the upward signal flow, two guard time slots are provided at the beginning and the end of the frame. The C CH has 128 bits and is used for sequencing call connections. The ACQLOCAL CH has 280 bits. When in the acquisition mode, it is used for delay adjustments at the initial system lineup. When in local maintenance mode it is used for delay fine adjustments. The TELEX CH also has 152 bits and may be used for low data rates up to 19.2 kbits or up to 40 telex channels. The V CH has the same structure when used for telex or data service. Modulation is normally QPSK, and therefore 2 bits of PCM data are transmitted per symbol. Hence, for a 4 ms frame, 256 bits of PCM data are transmitted 64 kbitsec per V CH. 24  Report on Question 162  Figure 2.2.7    Frame format in a DRMASS TDMTDMA system        Figure 2.2.8    Frame format of Subscriber Time Slot        Report on Question 162 25  Services Provided and Grade of Service A modern multiple access subscriber radio system operates at a high technology level and should be able to provide at least the following services  Ordinary telephone service  Coin telephone service  Data transmission, typically up to 384 kbits which, with modern software, is adequate for providing PCtoPC medium quality video conferencing  Telex service  Dedicated preassigned telephone and data channels   4wire communications with EM signalling  Intracall service. This refers to calls between subscribers using the sam terminal station.   Emergency priority call service. If used, nonpriority calls may be dropped.  Priority automatic callback service. If a subscriber has this priority, his call may be placed in a queue if the system is busy. He will be called back automatically ahead of ordinary callbacks when a channel is available.   Ordinary automatic callback service  Call forwarding on busyno responseunconditional status  Call waiting  Threeway calling  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA operations  4wire DAMA Demand Assigned Multiple Access service  ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network service Since a DRMASS system utilizes the concentrator concept, the maximum number of subscribers that can be handled in a system is a function of the average traffic generated by each subscriber, the desired blocking probability, and the number of time slots. Based on experience, the average business hour traffic call rate of a DRMASS system is typically set at 0.09 erlangline. This is for an example design where coin telephone sets 0.3 erlangline is assumed to use 10 of the system capacity, business communications 0.1 erlangline constitute 30, and residential subscriber lines 0.05 erlangline are 60 of the system capacity. The blocking probability i.e. the ratio of busy calls to the total number of calls in a certain time period is typically set at 0.01 or 1. Based on these assumptions, a DRMASS system with 60 time slots will be suitable for 512 subscribers. However, by implementing intracalling in the system, the number of subscriber lines can be doubled to 1024.  The Base Station Since in most cases a subscriber radio system has to be interfaced into a national switched telephone network, the most practical location of the base station is at an existing exchange that already may have a radio tower that can be used, and may have enough power generating ACDC equipment to power the base station. However, where this is not practical, part of the base station equipment including the RF modules may be located anywhere, and the remaining equipment in the telephone exchange area as long as the two sites can be interfaced by a 2 Mbits digital connection or wireless communications links. The major equipment elements in the base station are the following  One Base Station Controller Module BSCM  One TDM Controller Unit TCU including RF transmitter, receiver and antenna. 26  Report on Question 162  One or several Loop Open End Modules LOEM  One or several Data Units DU  A computerized supervisory and control system for operations and maintenance purposes If for some reason it is not practical to install all the base station equipment at the telephone exchange site, the radio tower with antenna and the TCU module may be installed in a separate location and connected to the BSCM by two 2 Mbits links. The functions of the base station communications equipment are described as follows Base Station Controller Module BSCM This module is acting as a concentrator and provides 2wire interface with up to 1024 subscriber line circuits. It will concentrate 1024 telephone lines and convert them into 60 time slots in two 2.048 Mbits TDM data streams. The concentrator contains processor units which, under stored program control, perform call sequencing and execute remote supervision of the complete system.  Loop Open End Modules LOEM and Data Units DU The LOEM modules provides the interface to the local exchange by plugin cards. Typically, two types of cards are available, namely one for 8 ordinary telephone lines and one for 4 coin telephone lines. The type and quantity required depend on the LC Line Circuit configuration in the subscriber and repeater stations. The DU module contains plugin cards for data channel interfaces with the telephone exchange. The configuration of these cards depends on the overall DRMASS system configuration and contains interfaces for data ports, telex channels, and 4wire EM signalling.  TDM Controller Unit TCU The TCU converts the two 2.048 Mbits data streams from the concentrator into two 2.496 Mbits radio TDM signals for the downward transmit path and reverses this for the upward receive path. Orderwire and supervisorymaintenance signals are multiplexeddemultiplexed in the TCU. Duplicated working and standby configuration is normally implemented for higher reliability. In addition, an unprotected version is available for lowcost applications. The TCU can be located remotely from the BSCM concentrator equipment via two 2.048 Mbits communications links with ITUT G.703 interfaces. The radio or TDM part of the TCU performs the following functions  It converts the two 2.048 Mbits data streams from the concentrator to packet data for radio communications, and multiplexes the control, supervisory and maintenance signals onto the packet data. The data is modulated and transmitted to the nearest repeater station and onwards to the next repeater stations and subscriber stations, as applicable.  It receives the burst mode TDMA RF signals from the nearest repeater station, regenerates the packet data, removes the control, supervisory and maintenance information from the baseband data and converts the signals into two 2.048 Mbits data streams and sends them to the concentrator. Within the TCU, a main processor controls the TCU side of the data transfer between the TCU and the BSCM for control of the radio protocol. The frame converter converts the baseband 2.048 Mbits PCM frame to the radio frame 2.496 Mbits format upward, and from 2.496 Mbits to 2.048 Mbits downward. It also multiplexes and demultiplexes the radio frames, and supervises radio transmission errors.  The 60 time slots are transmitted in RF carriers using QPSK modulation. Transmitter power is typically about 1 watt from a transistor amplifier, and the receiver has a noise figure of about 3 dB. It will maintain its operation with acceptable BER rates down to about  85 dBm. Depending on the system configuration, omni directional antennas gain  10 dB, or up to 4meter parabolic antennas gain  3237 dB are typically used.   Report on Question 162 27  The Repeater Stations The repeater stations serve two main purposes. Firstly, a certain repeater station will communicate with subscribers within its coverage area. Typically, a total of 256 subscribers may be located in this coverage area. Secondly, it will pass on a call to the next repeater if the call is not intended for one of its own subscribers. There is no real limitation to the number of repeaters in a system, but due to practical considerations one DRMASS system is rarely implemented with more than 23 repeaters and an overall distance of 1080 km. Figure 2.2.9 shows a block diagram of a segment of a typical DRMASS system configuration. 2 repeater stations and 2 subscriber stations are shown one miniterminal with 2 telephone lines served by the base station, and one multiline terminal which may contain up to 16 telephone lines, served by a repeater station. The repeater station receives the downward signal stream transmitted from the base station or preceding repeater station. After regenerating the signal, the repeater transmits it on a different radio frequency, not only to the subscriber units within its service area, but also to neighbouring repeaters for further repeating. The upward signal is transmitted towards the base station in the reverse direction. The multiple use of repeaters allows the service area to be expanded to virtually any distance without any noticeable degradation in the signal quality because digital transmission with regeneration of signals is used. A repeater station may be implemented as an indoor unit or an outdoor unit. The major equipment blocks are the repeater unit itself for receiving, regeneration, and retransmission of RF signals, and one or more dropout unit. One dropout unit will typically serve 64 subscribers in an outdoortype repeater station. Indoor repeaters may contain up to 4 dropout units for service to 256 subscribers.  The Subscriber Stations A subscriber station may be a multiline terminal or a miniterminal. A multiline subscriber station is composed of a SU Subscriber Unit and a DOU Dropout Unit combination for a capacity of up to 64 subscribers for outdoor type repeaters. Alternatively, a SRM Subscriber Rack Mount and a DORM Dropout Rack Mount combination may be used to provide up to 256 subscribers capacity indoor type repeater. The miniterminal for indoor installation is for small subscriber capacities typically one telephone set and one coin telephone line.  Due to the low power consumption of the subscriber units achieved by the use of LSI technology, solarpowered operation is made possible for these terminals. The terminal equipment and solar control unit including batteries can be accommodated in small cabinets suitable for installation either on a wall of an existing building or on an antenna pole in an outdoor environment. A subscriber station performs the following functions  It receives the RF transmission from the base or repeater station and regenerates the 2wire analogue telephone signal information and relays this information to the proper subscriber line.  It detects incoming call requests from the subscriber line and converts the 2wire analogue telephone signals to RF bursts which are transmitted to the repeater or base station. Data port cards may be substituted for voice cards in order to provide data communications channels.  The miniterminal is suitable for locations where only one or two subscriber lines are required. These lines may be a combination of services such as two telephone sets, two coin telephone lines, one telephone and one coin line, one telephone line and one data line, or one coin telephone line and one data line.  28  Report on Question 162  Figure 2.2.9    Example segment of DRMASS system configuration       Digital Cordless Telephone System DCTS Cell Stations2 Small economical mobile or fixed telephony terminals with limited range may be integrated into a subscriber radio system. These terminals are using the most advanced digital cordless telephony technology and may be operated within a range of 35 km from a DCTS cell station for fixed terminals and up to about 1 km for portable handsets. Figure 2.2.10 shows a conceptual drawing of a cell station with all electronic equipment including power supply mounted on a pole. Portable terminals will typically use a short whip antenna, and fixed installations will use a small polemounted Yagi antenna. The terminals use 32 kbits Adaptive Differential Pulse Code Modulation ADPCM and dynamic channel assignment is employed in the system. The DCTS cell stations also operate in the 1.9 GHz band. A maximum of 52 subscribers can access one cell station by using TDMA techniques with a traffic loading of 0.1 erlang and a 1 blocking rate. Voiceband data and fax service may be used up to a speed of 7.2 kbits.   2 See also Fascicle 2, Chapter 4.   Report on Question 162 29  Centralized Operations and Maintenance Control In trend with operating and maintaining modern communications systems, multiple access subscriber radio systems will have automatic centralized operations and maintenance facilities. This is in particular important for a system employed for rural communications where all equipment is operating unattended often in inhospitable environments, and where technical expertise is unavailable and long in arriving if required.  Figure 2.2.10    DCTS cell station CS      A centralized operations and maintenance system will normally be colocated with the base station equipment and will contain facilities for overall system equipment status monitoring, maintenance and testing. Specifically, from one central position, one operator should be able to monitor and control functions within the following areas  Alarm status and reporting.  Subscriber line testing insulation resistancecapacitance, and test calls to specific subscribers.  Traffic statistics reporting.  System reconfiguration. All above functions should be performed remotely and controlled from the base station. If such a system is implemented together with the multiple access subscriber radio system, it is possible to operate a 1024 subscriber system spread over a 1080 km radius from the base station with one maintenance engineer and one technician, provided the equipment is designed to modern MTBF Mean Time Between Failures requirements. 30  Report on Question 162 2.2.5 Digital Radio Networks a Long haul digital radio systems Long haul, high capacity digital radio systems can be competitive with optical fibre, especially in difficult terrain, like mountains, across lakes or rivers, in urban areas with expensive or unavailable rightsofway, or where speed of deployment is important. Also, digital long haul radio systems can reuse a vast system of towers and buildings, previously used by analogue radio systems employed in national backbone telecommunications networks. Channel capacities employed by these systems are the maximum that can be achieved with highstate QAM modulation schemes. A large number of channels may be operated on the same route by using an n  1 switching system. Because of the long distances involved the lower frequency bands of 4 and 6 GHz have been widely used in many countries. b Short haul digital radio systems Today digital radio systems find a major application in all those cases where cable laying would be difficult, costly and time consuming. Digital radio systems can be deployed very rapidly, especially if small unobtrusive antennas can be located on existing buildings or towers and distances are relatively short. Equipment operating at frequencies above 15 GHz meet these requirements very well because they are small, rugged and economical. The explosive growth of cellular networks for mobile radio has generated a large market for these millimetre wave radios. They interconnect cell sites with Mobile Switching Centres MSC using capacities that are relatively low, ranging from 1DS1 to 4DS1 or 1E1 to 4E1. Because of the low capacity, protection is sometimes omitted or otherwise provided by automatic hot standby switching. And since hop lengths are often short there is no need for frequency or space diversity protection against multipath fading. Rain attenuation is the predominant cause of signal outage, which can be kept within ITU requirements by the use of high system gain radios and short hops. Where larger hop lengths are required, digital radios operating below 15 GHz have to be used. The 2 GHz band was used extensively in the United States of America for low capacity connections by power and gas companies. This band has now been allocated to various PCN uses and the existing radio services can be redeployed in the Lower 6 GHz L6, Upper 6 GHz U6 and 11 GHz bands which have been opened up for low capacity digital applications. These bands are not affected by rain fading and therefore provide large distance capabilities. Space and frequency diversity systems are used here as countermeasures for multipath fading with frequency diversity systems normally operated in the form of an n  1 protection switching system. In the interest of spectrum conservation, the FCC in the United States of America demands that the number n grows to at least 3 within three years after first deployment on a route. This rules out permanent 1  1 frequency diversity systems. Other countries may have other rules or no such requirements. c Radio Local Area Networks RLAN Todays computerbased business activity largely depends on communication infrastructure provided by local area networks LANs. LANs have to be extended in line with the increase of terminal users, and therefore designed to handle bursty traffic in order to efficiently share computer resources. However a wired LAN has many constraints in the aspects of cost, maintenance and installation in particular for networks with complicated architecture Many types of RLAN exist including those already put into service or to be realized in the near future. Table 2.2.1 summarizes typical examples of RLANs using frequency bands above 1 GHz and having maximum data rate higher than 1 Mbits. Information on wireless local loop technologies is available in Fascicle 2, Chapter 4.2.2.1.

When the users radio antenna is stationary over a prolonged period of time, the term fixed radio is used a radio transceiver capable of being carried or moved around, but stationary when in operation, is called a portable radio a radio transceiver capable of being carried and used, by a vehicle or by a person on the move, is called mobile radio. Individual radio users may communicate directly or via one more intermediaries, which may be passive radio repeaters, base stations, or switches. When all intermediaries are located on the Earth, the terms terrestrial radio system and radio system are used when at least one intermediary is satellite borne, the terms satellite radio system and satellite system are used. According to the location of a user, the terms land, maritime, aeronautic, space, and deepspace radio systems are used. The second unique property of all terrestrial and satellite radio systems is that they all share the same natural resource  the airwaves frequency bands and the space. Recent developments in microwave monolithic integrated circuit MMIC, application specific integrated circuit ASIC, analoguedigital signal processing ADSP, and battery technology, supported by computer aided design CAD and robotics in manufacturing allow a viable implementation of miniature radio transceivers. The continuous flux of market forces excited by the possibilities of a myriad of new services and great profits, international and domestic standards forces who manage the common natural resource  the airwaves, and technology forces capable of creating viable products, acted harmoniously and created a broad choice of communications voice and data, information, and navigation systems, which propelled an explosive growth of mobile radio services for travellers. The terms fixed radio service and mobile radio service are defined by the IUT Radio Regulations   Fixed service a radiocommunication service between specified fixed points.  Mobile service a radiocommunication service between mobile and land stations, or between mobile stations. Indeed, these radio service definitions form the basis for the allocation of radio spectrum internationally by the ITU as well as domestically within each country. For the most part, the ITU has made joint allocations to the mobile and fixed services in various frequency bands. Traditionally, in some countries a choice has been made between the two services.  2.3.2 Spectrum Key input parameters to the design of a wireless network are teledensity over time and subscriber usage e.g., Erlangs per subscriber. These variables establish the traffic density e.g., Erlangs per square kilometre that the wireless system needs to support. The availability of spectrum, channelization of the particular radio access technology, the extent to which frequencies can be reused, and cellsize, all influence the traffic carrying capacity of a radiobased system. Wireless access systems, from an RF planningnetwork viewpoint, are deployed in a similar way to cellular systems, even though the   Report on Question 162 35 teledensity requirements may be different. Radio spectrum requirements and availability need to be examined. Figure 2.3.1 shows bands of the radio spectrum where fixed wireless access systems operate in some countries. The precise availability of radio spectrum for these applications is subject to local regulations. For example, in addition to the bands 1.4 and 2.42.6 GHz, the 3.5 GHz band has been endorsed by CEPTETSI, as is the 10.5 GHz band for use in Europe. Also, in Region 2 the 3.43.7 GHz band is being considered for wireless access applications in some countries. The applications shown in Figure 2.3.1 for different frequency bands may be known by different names which are related to the traditional use of these bands. However, the common underlying aspect is wireless access, which may take many flavours depending on the signal transfer capabilities offered e.g., voice, data, image, video, mix of service e.g., purely fixed, mixed fixedmobile, nomadic, and range e.g., use of repeaters.  Figure 2.3.1    Examples of bands of radio spectrum for wireless access             36  Report on Question 162 The choice of technology needs to be related to capacity and cost requirements as it is shown in Figure 2.3.2.  Figure 2.3.2    Mapping technology onto appropriate requirements      2.3.3 Terrestrial Systems In a terrestrial mobile radio network, a repeater was usually located at the highest point in the vicinity, offering maximum service area coverage. As the number of users increased, the available frequency spectrum became unable to handle the increased traffic, and a need for frequency reuse arose. The service area was split into many small subareas called cells, and the term cellular radio was born. Frequency reuse offers an increased system capacity, whereas the smaller cell size can offer an increased service quality but at the expense of increased complexity of the users terminal and network infrastructure. The tradeoffs between real estate availability base stations and cost, the price of equipment base and mobile, network complexity, and implementation dynamics dictate the shape and the size of a cellular network. 2.3.3.1 Analogue Cellular Technologies Analogue cellular modulation is based on the principle of Frequency Modulation FM. The speech to be transmitted is used to modulate the carrier causing it to be varied in amplitude and frequency. Most analogue cellular systems use Frequency Modulation FM for speech and Frequency Shift Keying FSK for data. In analogue cellular systems, a traffic channel is usually modulated on one radio frequency. Table 2.3.1 gives some of the operating analogue cellular radio systems the North American AMPS, the Japanese land MCSL1 and MCSL2, the Nordic NMT900, the German C450, and the United Kingdoms TACS.

NMT was developed in the late 1970s, and was operational before cellular systems were implemented. This system operates in a manner similar to a cellular system and is used by Iceland, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland and Holland. A modified version is also used by Denmark.  Total access communication system TACS Total Access Communication System TACS is a 15 MHz frequency spectrum used in Europe, some parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

The overall band occupies 10 MHz of spectrum. This allows 800 total channels. Channels are not separated into separate bands A or B in these systems. The original specification, JTACS, uses only the even numbered channels. Only when the narrow specification NTACS was implemented, did the odd channels come into use.  Channel spacing 25 kHz Duplex spacing 55 MHz Frequency range for voice and signalling channels Base receivemobile transmit 915.025924.475 MHz Base transmitmobile receive 860.025869.975 MHz Voice channels NTACS  752 JTACS 376 Signalling channels NTACS 48 JTACS 24    Report on Question 162 39 JTACSNTACS cell sites receive on the higher frequencies of the allocated spectrum transmit on the lower frequencies spectrum. Conversely, AMPS and TACS cell sites transmit on the higher frequencies and receive on the lower frequencies. As a result, JTACSNTACS subscriber units cannot be used in TACS or AMPS systems. The same is also true of the subscriber units of the TACS and AMPS systems  they cannot be used in the JTACS NTACS systems.  Universal total access communication system UTACS Universal Total Access Communication System UTACS is used in Europe, some parts of Asia, the Middle East, China and Africa. UTACS has a 15 MHz frequency spectrum using 25 kHz channel spacing, providing up to 920 channels. The UTACS frequency spectrum and channel allocation is the same as the combined TACSETACS with the exception of the lower 8 MHz of the spectra. With 8 MHz less spectrum, UTACS has 320 fewer channels. 2.3.3.2 Second Generation Systems Designed during the 1980s, all of the socalled second generation mobile communication systems are digital. For voice calls, digitally encoded speech is transmitted on the radio interface using one of the many available digital modulation schemes. To offset the processing complexity required for these digital systems, two advantages are 1 the possibility of using spectrally efficient radio transmission schemes e.g., time division multiple access TDMA or code division multiple access CDMA in comparison to the analogue frequency division multiple access FDMA schemes previously employed and 2 the ability to implement of a wide variety of integrated speech and data services and security features e.g., encryption. Typical cellular, cordless, and PMR network architectures are represented in Figure 2.3.3. These are reference models which may not always fully apply to all systems described hereafter.  In cellular systems, the base station subsystem BSS comprises a base station controller BSC and radio transceivers BS or BTS which provide radio communication with MS in the covered area. The network subsystem NSS includes dedicated mobile switching equipment MSC linking all system elements through leased lines to PSTN, ISDN, and Packet Switched Public Data Network PSPDN. The home and visitor location registers HLRVLR are databases containing mobile subscriber data and used for subscriber registration and mobility management. Copies of the subscribers secret keys are stored in the authentication centre AuC and the mobile equipment serial numbers are stored in the equipment identity register EIR. ITUT Signalling System No. 7 SS7 and related application protocols are often used in the mobile network. All system elements are operated, controlled, and maintained by the operation and maintenance centre OMC. The cordless network architecture depends on application. For residential use, the portable station PS behaves like a regular telephone and has direct access to the PSTN through the private BS. In a publicaccess system, BSs are connected to a local exchange LE containing a local database DB used for subscriber registration and mobility management in the covered area. The LEs are connected to the PSTNISDN for the purpose of traffic routing and to centralized elements of the cordless system through the PSPDN for signalling exchange. These centralized elements perform control functions user identification, charging, network management and may contain a centralized database that stores location updates of the cordless subscribers and, therefore, enables routing of incoming calls. For business applications, the same private automatic branch exchange PABX may be used for both wire and wireless access. The wireless PABX WPABX interconnects the BSs of the private network. Cordless subscribers can therefore access other private wired subscribers or the PSTNISDN. The WPABX generally incorporates the subscriber DB and control functions of the cordless system. 40  Report on Question 162  Figure 2.3.3    Network reference models      The architecture of a PMR network is somewhat similar to that of cellular networks, but the BSS is generally consists of a single piece of equipment incorporating the BS and the local station controller LSC. Since the LSC contains a copy of the subscribers location register LR, local calls which represent a significant part of the traffic can be established and routed locally in the BSS, thus achieving a short call setup time and maintaining local operation, even in fallback mode, if the BSSMSC link is interrupted. Intersite calls are routed through the MSC and access to other networks PSTNISDNPDN, or devices PABX may be provided either at MSC or BSS level. Line stations LS may be connected directly to BSS or MSC, or through an intervening network e.g., ISDN. Interworking of different PMR networks of the same standard is provided through the intersystem interface ISSI. Mobiles may also use direct simplex communications direct mode, either autonomously or while keeping contact with the network dual watch.   Report on Question 162 41 The major second generation systems are described in Table 2.3.2  Table 2.3.2    Air interface characteristics of second generation systems    42  Report on Question 162 2.3.3.2.1 Digital Cellular Mobile Networks 2.3.3.2.1.1 Global System for Mobile CommunicationsDigital Cellular System 1800 GSMDCS1800 The GSM standard was specified by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI for panEuropean digital cellular mobile radio services. It was designed to answer the need for a common mobile communications standard throughout Europe, where a variety of incompatible analogue cellular systems like the Nordic Mobile Telephone NMT and the Total Access Communications Systems TACS existed. The allocation of a dedicated panEuropean frequency band around 900 MHz and the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding MoU between countries, which committed to launch nationwide GSM networks with internetworking capabilities, were the other important steps leading to an European network. Phase 1 of the GSM standard was completed by ETSI in 1990 and is the basis of currently implemented networks. It provides a variety of speech and data services. These services, progressively being offered to the users, include telephony, emergency calls, conference calls, fax transmission, short messages, and data transmission at various rates up to 9600 bits. Supplementary services like call forwarding, call barring, and connected line identification are also defined. The GSM network architecture closely follows the general principles introduced in the preceding section. All interfaces between network elements have been standardized, including MSCBSC A and BSCBTS Abis interfaces. Interfaces to AuCHLREIR and to PSTN ISDN use SS7 with the mobile application part MAP protocol for noncircuit related signalling. This architecture, with a clear breakdown between the different equipment and different functional parts e.g. radio resource management in the BSC, facilitates evolution. The subscriber identity module SIM is the key to personal mobility, whereby a user can use any GSM terminal equipment just by inserting his SIM card. This smart card contains all subscriber data and is also used for basic security functions, such as subscriber identity authentication and key generation for traffic encryption on the air interface. This prevents fraudulent use of the system and ensures call privacy. The GSM air interface is characterized by an eighthorder TDMA scheme with frequency division duplex FDD. The available frequency band in Europe is 2  25 MHz, with a radio channel spacing of 200 kHz. Data is modulated at 270 kbits using Gaussian minimum shift keying GMSK modulation and transmitted in bursts of 577 s. Each TDMA frame consists of eight time slots corresponding to eight separate physical channels. Each of these physical channels supports a combination of logical channels that are used in turn to carry signalling or traffic data. Slow frequency hopping is used to combat adverse propagation conditions, and most infrastructure implementations also include BTS receiver antenna diversity. The relatively low carrier to interference ratio CI operational value 9 dB is achieved through powerful channel coding, interleaving, and equalization techniques. Speech transmission is based on a linear prediction coder called regular pulse excitedlong term prediction RPELTP, which yields a net bit rate of 13 kbits and a gross bit rate of 22.8 kbits after channel coding. The air interface protocol follows a classical layered structure and includes a number of advanced features that are specific to mobile radio applications, such as mobile assisted handover MAHO, power control in both up and down links, and discontinuous transmission DTX based on voice activity detection VAD. GSM standardization in ETSI is still an ongoing process, and a number of additional services and features such as multiparty calls, halfrate coder, and general packet data service will be available in phase 2. Standardization of a GSM adaptation tailored to railway application has also recently started. This will include specific features such as group calls or support of highspeed mobiles.   Report on Question 162 43 One important GSM extension is the digital cellular system1800 DCS1800 standard designed for personal communication networks PCN, optimized for urban and suburban use and for which various licences have already been granted in Europe. The main differences with GSM are the frequency band around 1800 MHz, national roaming capabilities, and a reduced transmission power hence a reduced cell size. It is also a candidate standard for the U.S. Personal Communication Services PCS in the 1900MHz band. Originally focused on the European market, the GSMDCS1800 standard has now achieved worldwide recognition and deployment. More than 65 countries have already adopted the GSM standard, and at least 40 GSMDCS1800 networks are currently in service around the world. These figures are constantly growing. See Fascicle 2  Chapter 3 for more details  2.3.3.2.1.2 Interim Standard IS54  The main driving force for the definition of a second generation digital standard in North America was the rapidly growing demand for cellular services during the 1980s. This would have easily exceeded the capacity of the analogue networks based on the advanced mobile phone system AMPS. Accordingly, the new digital standard was specified by the Telecommunications Industry Association TIA upon request of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association CTIA, with the major objective being to provide a significant increase in system capacity while maintaining upward compatibility with widespread AMPS. The Federal Communications Commission FCC, however, decided to open the existing cellular band 2  25 MHz in the 800MHz range to any suitable technology. The IS54 standard was finally selected from several proposals and published in January 1991. Both dual mode AMPSIS54 mobile stations and base stations are specified, thus enabling the design of equipment capable of analogue or digital operation. Other related standards have also been defined IS55 and IS56 were defined for the performance specifications and measurement methods for mobile stations and base stations, respectively. Concerning network aspects, several standards have been developed by TIA since 1988 independently from the air interface design and are, hence, applicable to analogue AMPS as well as IS54 and other systems.  Though less ISDN oriented than GSM, the IS54 standard also supports several services, e.g., telephone service, short message service, and data services with a maximum transmission rate of 9.6 kbits. Supplementary services include call forwarding, threeparty call, and call barring. Security features include a personal identification number PIN, subscriber authentication upon connection to the system, and voice as well as subscriber data encryption. The IS54 air interface uses TDMAFDD technology with three channels per 30kHz AMPS carrier. The modulation bit rate is 48.6 kbits. 4 shifted differential quadrature phase shift keying DQPSK modulation is employed. For each full rate channel, the gross bit rate is 13 kbits, and speech is encoded at 7.95 kbits using a vector sum excited linear prediction VSELP algorithm. Advanced radiolink control based on power control and DTX improves spectrum efficiency. The air interface protocol, compatible with the AMPS protocol, includes an optional extended mode to allow for the addition of new system features and operational capabilities. The traffic capacity achievable with IS54 is expected to be three to four times that of existing AMPS systems. This capacity will be doubled with the introduction of a halfrate codec, currently under standardization. Using the original frequency band of the AMPS system, digital channels compliant to the IS54 standard are now progressively replacing analogue channels, thereby alleviating the shortage of spectrum while enabling a smooth transition from analogue to digital. Network and terminal equipment are already available from several manufacturers and commercial service is being offered in the largest U.S. cities. Based on the IS54 standard, Hughes has developed a new technology called ETDMA, with operational networks in the U.S. and recently adopted for several regional networks in Russia and China. It is claimed to achieve a significantly higher capacity, taking advantage of advanced features such as halfrate coding, digital speech interpolation DSI and channel pools. 44  Report on Question 162 2.3.3.2.1.3 Interim Standard IS95 Introduction Code division multiple access CDMA provides a spectrally efficient, digital solution for the second generation of cellular, wireless telephony, and personal communications systems PCS services. The CDMA air interface is near optimum in its use of the subscriber station transmitter power, enabling the widespread commercial use of lowcost, lightweight, handheld portable units that have improved battery life. The technology is also near optimum in its link budgets, minimizing the number of base stations required for an excellent grade of service coverage. As customer penetration in a given service area increases, the system is called upon to deliver more capacity. CDMA has demonstrated a capacity increase over advanced mobile phone service AMPS of at least a factor of ten, which means that up to ten times fewer base stations will be required when customer demand for service increases. The use of soft handoff nearly eliminates the annoyance of dropped calls, fading, and poor voice quality.  CDMA, in this context, means not just generic code division multiple access, but the specific implementation of it described in the air interface standard TIA EIA IS95A Mobile Station  Base Station Compatibility Standard for DualMode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System. Compliance with the requirements in this standard assures subscribers and service providers that equipment of all types will interoperate satisfactorily. IS95A originated with a system design developed by QUALCOMM, beginning in April 1989. The early requirements were defined by the cellular carriers with input from manufacturers and carriers and by public testing. After the initial proposal and presentation of a draft air interface, a standards committee composed of system operators, subscriber equipment vendors, infrastructure equipment vendors, and test equipment vendors reviewed, revised, and formalized the air interface. The formal adoption of what is now the IS95A air interface took place in December 1993. The CDMA System The multiple access scheme exploits isolation provided by the antenna system, geometric spacing, power gating of transmissions by voice activity, power control, an efficient modem, and a signal design that uses powerful error correction coding. A combination of openloop and closedloop power control through measurements of the received power at the mobile station and the base station commands the mobile station to make power adjustments in order to maintain only the power level required for adequate performance. This minimizes interference to other users, helps to overcome fading, and conserves battery power in the mobile station. The CDMA digital cellular waveform design uses a pseudorandom noise PN spread spectrum carrier. The chip rate of the PN spreading sequence was chosen so that the resulting bandwidth is about 1.25 MHz after filtering, or approximately onetenth of the total bandwidth allocated to one cellular service carrier. The USA Federal Communications Commission FCC has allocated a total of 25 MHz for mobile station to cell site and 25 MHz for cell site to mobile station, for the provision of cellular services. The FCC has divided this allocation equally between two service providers, the A and the B carriers, in each service area. Because of the time sequence of the FCCs actions in allocating the cellular spectrum, the 12.5 MHz allocated to each carrier for each direction of the link is further subdivided into two subbands. For the B carriers, the subbands are 10 MHz and 2.5 MHz each. For the A carriers, the subbands are 11 MHz and 1.5 MHz each. A signal bandwidth of less than 1.5 MHz fits into any of the subbands, whereas a bandwidth of less than 2.5 MHz fits into all but one subband.   Report on Question 162 45  Figure 2.3.4    View of CDMA concept     A set of ten 1.25MHzbandwidth CDMA channels can be used by each operator if the entire allocation is converted to CDMA. Initially, only one or a small number of 1.25 MHz channels needs to be removed from the present PM analogue service to provide digital service. This facilitates the deployment by introducing a gradual reduction in analogue capacity. Each 1.25 MHz CDMA segment can provide about twice the capacity of the entire 12.5 MHz allocation using the present FM system. Some frequency guard band is necessary if there are adjacent highpower cellular or other frequencies in use, and the maximum capacity of the CDMA cell is required. Capacity can be sacrificed for decreased guard band if desired. Adjacent CDMA channels need not employ a guard band. Overview of the IS95 CDMA Standard The common air interface standard, IS95A, prescribes, in detail, the behaviour of dualmode CDMAAMPS subscriber stations, and, to a lesser extent, the base stations. Use of compliant subscriber stations assures base station manufacturers of predictable behaviour on which to base system designs. An IS95A compliant subscriber station can obtain service by communicating with either an AMPS analogue PM base station or with a CDMA base station. System selection depends on the availability of either system in the geographic area of the station, as well as its programmed preference. Minimum performance requirements for dualmode base stations, IS97, and subscriber stations, IS98, supplement the basic air interface. 46  Report on Question 162 IS95A emphasizes subscriber station requirements because the subscriber side reflects all call processing features, and because the specification is simpler in the context of a single user. In contrast to the detailed subscriber station requirements, base station requirements are incomplete. Generally the standard prescribes only those base station requirements that are important for the design of subscriber stations, leaving unspecified behaviour to the discretion of the vendors. Base stations are fielded in much smaller quantities, but at much greater cost per unit. Market considerations therefore encourage good designs.  The standard specifies that mobile stations operating with analogue base stations meet the analogue compatibility provisions for mobile stations as specified in EIAITAIS54B, BualMode Mobile StationBase Station Compatibility Specification, January 1992. The incorporation of the analogue portions of EIAITAIS54B instead of EIAITA553 Mobile StationLand Station Compatibility Specification, September 1989 accommodates all the changes to analogue operation imposed by the EIAITAIS54B dualmode standard. 2.3.3.2.1.4 Personal Digital Cellular PDC As in North America and in Europe, the design of the PDC standard in Japan was motivated in the late 1980s by the saturation of analogue cellular networks and by the need for new and enhanced services. After a study phase initiated by the Japanese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in April 1989, the PDC air interface standard was issued in April 1991 by the Research and Development Centre for Radio Systems RCR under the name STD27 RCRSTD27, 1991. It was complemented by network interface specifications providing the basis for a unified digital cellular system in Japan and enabling connectivity with fixed ISDN. RCR STD27 is a common air interface specification. Though there are some similarities with the American IS54 standard in terms of technical features, no compatibility with existing analogue systems was required here. The new digital systems in Japan benefit from a specific spectrum allocation, initially in the 800MHz band and later in the 1.5GHz band. The carrier spacing is 25 kHz and the multiple access scheme is a TDMAFDD of order 3 with the current fullrate codec and of order 6 with the future halfrate codec. The carrier bit rate is 42 kbits. 4 DQPSK modulation is used. The fullrate speech codec employs a VSELP algorithm with a gross bit rate of 11.2 kbits and a net bit rate of 6.7 kbits, with forward error correction based on a convolutional code rate  and a cyclic redundancy check CRC. A specific channel assignment procedure flexible channel reuse from one BS to another enables an increase of the system capacity. The standard also specifies power control and MAHO type handover procedures. PDC systems will provide numerous services, including speech transmission, data transmission G3facsimile, modem, videotex, and short message service. Supplementary services such as calling line identification, call forwarding, or threeparty call are also foreseen. The air interface protocol is ISDN oriented with a layered structure following the open systems interconnection OSI principles, including a link access protocol called LAP DM at layer 2 and a layer 3 divided into radio transmission management RT, mobility management MM, and call control CC, based on ITUT I.451. Security features include authentication and encryption. Interfaces between network elements of a PDC system have been defined by cellular operators in Japan, except the A interface BSSMSC which is left open for implementation. The network architecture follows the reference model of ITUT SS7, if used between network elements and on the interface to other networks. The application protocols are an enhanced version of ISDN user part ISUP for circuit related signalling and MAP, developed as an application service element on TCAP, for noncircuit related signalling. Commercial service with a PDC network was initiated by NTT in 1993 for the 800MHz band and in 1994 for the 1.5GHz band. Two other operators have launched digital cellular services in the 500 MHz band in 1994, and the Japanese government has recently decided to allow two new operators to offer   Report on Question 162 47 digital service in the 1.5 GHz band. Enhancements of the PDC standard are also foreseen such as the halfrate codec, packet data, etc.. 2.3.3.3 Cordless Telephony CT The first generation of the UKs cordless telephones coded CT1 was developed as the answer to the large quantities of imported, technically superior, yet unlicensed mobile radio equipment. The simplicity and cost effectiveness of CT1 analogue radio and base station products using eight RF channels and FDMA scheme stem from their applications limited to incoming calls from a limited number of mobile users to the isolated telepoints. As the number of users grew, so did the cochannel interference levels, while the quality of the service deteriorated. Anticipating this situation, the second generation digital cordless telecommunications radio equipment and common air interface standards CT2CAI, incompatible with the CTl equipment, have been developed. CT2 schemes employ digital voice but the same FDMA principles as the CTl schemes. Network and frequency reuse issues necessary to accommodate anticipated residential, business, and telepoint traffic growth have not been addressed adequately. Recognizing these limitations and anticipating the market requirements, different FDMA, TDMA, CDMA, and hybrid schemes aimed at cellular mobile and digital cordless telecommunications DCT services have been developed. The technical characteristics of some schemes are given in Table 2.3.3  Table 2.3.3    Comparison of Digital Cordless Telephone Systems     The complete description of these systems is given in the Chapter 4 of Fascicle 2. 48  Report on Question 162 2.3.3.4 Private Mobile Radiocommunications PMR The world of PMR is manifold as there are so many different user groups with very different operational requirements. PMR is used by large organizations devoted to public safety, such as police, customs, fire brigades, rescue and ambulances etc. who need hierarchically structured networks with local, regional or even nationwide coverage. There are also nonemergency authorities like government departments, public health, environment protection, PTTs and the like with similar networks. However, PMR is also used by medium and small user groups with very differing requirements for a wide range of applications. PMR employs a variety of different technologies and covers a wide field of applications from local communication of small user groups up to networks with nationwide coverage.  Definitions To understand why PMR is versatile and unique it is necessary to understand the underlying operational and economical requirements and the resulting properties in detail. Firstly a short definition of PMR should be given PMR offers twoway radiocommunications carrying speech, data or a mix of both in nonpublic networks tailored to the specific operational requirements of professional mobile user groups for efficient and flexible communication within their area of daily operation. Until around 1980 PMR systems were mostly systems employing a single base station or repeater, the modulation was analogue FM or PM, and the modes of operation were simplex, half or full duplex. Up to 80 mobile stations were served per radio channel and the coverage could reach up to 30 km. PMR meant mainly PTT controlled voice transmission, with a relatively limited amount of proprietary data services. More recently paging and data facilities, digital switches and trunking, as well as PSTN and ISND connections were added. Sophisticated digital modulation including nonconstant envelope schemes have been introduced and digital signal processing permits the use of transmission techniques giving more channels and less interference. Moreover, integrated data services like X.25, X.400 etc. are now used to a larger extent and closed user groups CUG with dynamic reconfiguration are now possible. The use of a common channel is widespread and a decisive factor in the spectral efficiency of PMR. In many applications channel access must be available almost immediately, e.g. in less than 200 ms. It is important to note that PMR traffic is very different from cellular services, the talk time amounts to seconds instead of minutes with a much higher call frequency, hence the channel access time must be in a reasonable relation to the talk time. The coverage must be reliable and well suited to the users needs including the requirements for coverage in areas with bad propagation conditions. Since PMR comprises a variety of radiocommunication systems tailored to the different needs of various user groups several main applications can be distinguished. Selfprovided large PMR systems  consist of networks having typically more than 300 mobiles in densely populated areas. Utilities, public urban transport, railways, power suppliers and large industrial sites are the main user groups. Specific requirements including limited access to PSTN and ISDN characterise the needs of such groups. Small PMR networks  have less than 50 mobiles. Taxis, vehicle recovery services and business users are typical customers of such systems. The migration to GSM makes the future growth of this segment uncertain. Serviceprovided PMR systems  are often called Public Access Mobile Radio PAMR or CBS Community Base Stations. They are trunked systems run by an operator and have been in operation since the mid eighties. The technical and licensing conditions vary from country to country. Where PSTN or ISDN access is possible, these systems could be regarded as a public service competing with GSM. There are many PMR and PAMR networks with regional limited coverage, however, there are also networks operating nationwide for police and other emergency bodies.    Report on Question 162 49 Spectrum Allocation PMR originally was allocated in the band 40 to 80 MHz as a national matter. Hence there was no harmonisation resulting in currently three different channel separations and many other differences. Later the PMR allocations were extended considerably.  Equipment a Analogue equipment Conventional single channel PMR systems suffer traffic congestion and inefficient use of spectrum. Trunked systems use channels for control as well as traffic. The advantages are more efficient use of the spectrum and hence more traffic per channel. In order to save frequencies and thus be able to satisfy more users in the allocated PMR bands, the transition to 12.5 kHz channel separation instead of the 20 or 25 kHz was made during the seventies and the eighties in most European countries, and in most of the PMR bands. However in reality the overall gain in spectrum efficiency is about 1.1 instead of 2.0 if fading and shadowing are taken into account. Currently the trunked PMR systems MPT 1327 and MPT 1343 employing analogue speech transmission and signalling at 1200 bits dominate in the PAMR sector and several different variations are available. Trunked PMR generally is dominated by proprietary protocols. Conventional PMR users are also moving towards trunked system solutions because of the better frequency utilisation. b Digital equipment  The first attempt to create a complete digital PMR DPMR system standard was made by ETSI with DSRR for 25 kHz channels in the 900 MHz employing GMSK and the GSM speech coder. TETRA Trains European Trunk Radio System is the second DPMR system standard, called now EP TETRA, for DPMR equipment supporting all kinds of digital transmission, e.g. data and digitized voice. The results of the standardization work on TETRA are in the ETSI standards series ETS 300 392 to 396. i TETRA is a TDMA system with four times slots per carrier operating on 25 kHz channels for 385470 MHz, 870921 MHz. The gross bit rate is 38 kbits offering usable bit rates up to 28.8 kbits with time slot aggregation. Single time slot traffic channels provide a gross bit rate of 9 kbits and an unprotected user bit rate of 7.2 kbits.  ii Additionally two de facto PMR standards have been developed based on proprietary specifications, namely MPT 1327 and 1343 initiated by the UK DTI and providing digital calling and data transmission at 1.2 kbits combined with analogue voice and MOBITEX which was developed originally only for data at 1.2 kbits, while MOBITEX II or MOBITEX 8k offers a gross bit rate of 8.0 kbits on 25 kHz channels in the 400 and 900 MHz bands. iii Additionally, several proprietary fully digital PMR systems have been launched during the last few years. The most important of the proprietary DPMR systems in the market place are listed below  APCO 25 is a fully digital FDMA system developed for the USA, for the 150, 400 and 800 MHz bands, and based on 12.5 kHz channel separation and C4FM modulation. A future migration to 6.25 kHz channels and a linear modulation scheme CQPSK is envisaged.  ASTRO is a FDMA system developed by Motorola for DPMR applications in the 2 m band and for the three channel separations 12.5, 20 and 25 kHz using QPSKC modulation and providing a gross bit rate of 9.6 kbits.  EDACS is the Enhanced Digital Access Communications System developed by Ericsson with 12.5 kHz and 25 kHz channel separation in the 160, 450, 800 and 900 MHz bands. The system uses GFSK modulation and is upgradeable channel by channel from analogue FDMA also providing TDMA. The TDMA version was launched in 1995 and has become fully digital. EDACS is a multisite system and offers a gross bit rate of 9.6 kbits and large area coverage. 50  Report on Question 162  GeoNet is a FHMA system provided by Geotek. It is based on Frequency Hopping Multiple Access and 800 and 900 MHz band implementations are available. It is claimed that such a network with 50 data traffic exhibits a capacity increase by up to 30 times compared with trunked analogue PMR. This is possible due to the much higher transmission rate compared to systems like MPT 1327.  MIRS is the Motorola Integrated Radio Service which was introduced by Motorola in 1991 in the US. In 1995 MIRS was renamed iDEN Integrated Dispatch Enhanced network. It is a 6TDMA linear modulation system employing m16QAM m4 modulation and providing a gross bit rate of 64 bits, and thus a six fold capacity increase compared with traditional PMR systems is claimed, being increased further by appropriate geographic frequency reuse to 18 times. This system has been developed for the 800, 900 and 1,500 MHz bands.  TETRAPOL was developed by Matra and has been available since 1992. It is based on FDMA and available for the 80 MHz band and the 400 MHz range with a channel separation of 12.5 kHz. A channel separation of 10 kHz is also feasible on demand. The gross bit rate is 8.0 kbits based on GMSK modulation. Many of its current applications are devoted to public safety. Modern digital PMR systems are structured according to the ISOOSI layer model in a systematic and transparent order and offer a variety of specialised services. The Basic Services comprise Tele Services and Bearer Services while the Supplementary Services consist of PMR Type Supplementary Service and Telephone Type Supplementary Services. Teleservices offer different encrypted or nonencrypted types of calls, mainly individual calls point to point, group calls point to multipoint, acknowledged group calls and broadcast calls, while the bearer services comprise circuit mode unprotected or protected data and packet mode connection oriented or connectionless data, usually available with different network transmission speeds, e.g. for TETRA 2.4 to 9.6 kbits in case of protected data and 7.2 to 28.8 kbits for unprotected data in circuit mode. There are also a variety of PMR type supplementary services available. The most interesting ones are access priority, preemptive priority, priority call, call authorised by dispatcher, include call, transfer of group control, late entry, ambience listening, discreet listening, area selection, short number addressing, talking party identification and dynamic group number assignment. Lastly a comprehensive list of telephone type supplementary services is provided, e.g. list search call, call forwarding, call barring, call report, call waiting, call hold, calling party identity presentation, calling party identity restriction, call completion, advice of charge and call retention. This variety of offered services indicates the complexity of modern digital PMR systems. It also shows that such systems do not only offer all the usual PMR features but also some additional advanced services and a wide range of telephone services. 2.3.3.5 Third Generation Mobile Systems  IMT2000 IMT2000 third generation mobile systems will deliver voice, graphics, video and other broadband information direct to the user, regardless of location, network or terminal. These fully personal communication services will provide terminal and service mobility on fixed and mobile networks, taking advantage off the convergence of existing and future fixed and mobile networks and the potential synergies that can be derived from such convergence. The key benefits that IMT2000 promises include improvements in quality and security, incorporating broadband and networked multimedia services, flexibility in service creation and ubiquitous service portability. Networked multimedia may be defined to include services such as pay TV video and audioondemand interactive entertainment educational and information services and communication services such as videotelephony and fast, large filetransfer.  For more information on IMT2000 see Fascicle 2  Chapter 3, and the Final Acts of the World Radiocommunications Conference 2000.    Report on Question 162 51 2.3.3.6 The Use of Satellite Systems The systems employ one or more satellites to serve as base stations andor repeaters in a mobile radio network. The position of satellites relative to the service area is of crucial importance for the coverage, service quality, price, and complexity of the overall network. When a satellite encompasses the Earth in 24h periods, the term geosynchronous orbit has been used. An orbit that is inclined with the respect to the equatorial plane is called an inclined orbit an orbit with a 90 inclination is called a polar orbit. A circular geosynchronous 24h orbit over the equatorial plane 0 inclination is known as geostationary orbit, since from any point at the surface of the Earth the satellite appears to be stationary this orbit is particularly suitable for the land mobile services at low latitudes and for maritime and aeronautical services at latitudes of  80. Systems that use geostationary satellites include INMARSAT, MSAT, and AUSSAT. An elliptical geosynchronous orbit with the inclination angle of 63.4 is known as tundra orbit. An elliptical 12h orbit with the inclination angle of 63.4 is known as Molniya orbit. Both tundra and Molniya orbits have been selected for the coverage of the northern latitudes and the area around the North Pole for users at those latitudes, the satellites appear to wander around the zenith for a prolonged period of time. The coverage of a particular region regional coverage and the whole globe global coverage can be provided by different constellations of satellites including those in inclined and polar orbits. For example, inclined circular orbit constellations have been proposed for GPS 1824 satellites, 5563 inclination, Globalstar 48 satellites, 47 inclination, all systems will provide global coverage. ORBCOM system employs Pegasus launchable loworbit satellites to provide uninterrupted coverage of the Earth below  60 latitudes and an intermittent but frequent coverage over the polar regions. Satellite antenna systems can have one singlebeam global system or more beams multibeam spot system. The multibeam satellite systems similar to the terrestrial cellular system, employs antenna directivity to achieve better frequency reuse, at the expense of system complexity.

The orbit period in this case will be 6 hours. The world can be covered by 1012 satellites in 23 planes e.g. 5 satellites in each of 2 planes or 4 satellites in each of 3 planes.  If a LEO constellation is used, the satellite altitude is much lower, typically between 700 to 2000 km. The orbit period will be somewhere between 100 and 120 minutes. Due to the lower altitude, the view of the world from the satellite is rather small and the number of planes to cover the entire globe will have to be increased to 68, and the number of satellites must be 6 per plane. Typical representations of satellite system technology development as well as future trends are shown in Figure 2.4.1.  In the sections below the technology of GSO and nonGSO satellite systems are explained. 2.4.1 GSO Satellites The beginning of satellite communications was dominated by the GSO satellite concept. The Syncom2 satellite launch on July 19, 1963 was the first geosynchronous satellite 33 degrees orbit inclination, whereas Syncom3, launched on August 19, 1964 was the first geostationary satellite. The main advantages of GSO satellites are the following  Three operational satellites are sufficient to provide fullcoverage of the earth, excluding the polar caps.  GSO satellites are fixed in the sky, so it is not necessary to provide large earth station antennas with fast moving autotracking systems, as would be the case with LEO satellites.  The earth station antenna is required to work with only one GSO satellite for a continuous connection, whereas with LEO satellites it is either necessary to use an earth station antenna able to jump quickly from the setting satellite to a rising one, or to use two antennas for each earth station.  The onboard antenna of the GSO satellite may be very directive. A LEO satellite, due to its moderate altitude and quick movement with respect to earth, is forced to use a smallgain antenna or fast moving tracking systems if the onboard antenna gain is increased. GSO satellites have some disadvantages with respect to LEO satellites  The propagation delay is much larger and may cause an echo with about 500ms time deference  The free space attenuation is much larger. The distance between a point on the earth and the satellite will vary between a minimum of 35,786 km for the equatorial point aligned with the satellite and the centre of the earth, and a maximum of 41,756 km for the points located on the cone projected from the satellite and tangent to the earth surface. The free space attenuation for a GSO satellite link varies therefore for the various frequency ranges  They do not cover the polar caps  They may not provide coverage of big cities for landmobile communications, due to the shadows created by tall buildings. 2.4.1.1 Fixed GSO Satellite Systems Nonmobile satellite systems will continue to depend on satellites in GSO orbits, but as the lower microwave bands e.g. CBand allocated to such systems increasingly become more crowded, fixed satellite systems will be expected to move up to higher frequency bands e.g. Kuband. Therefore, 56  Report on Question 162 attention has centred on developing equipment for new and higher microwave bands or increasing the capacity of existing frequency bands. Two typical and different communications systems which use advanced digital concepts are  a Demand Assignment Multiple Access DAMA and  b Time Division Multiple Access TDMA system. In the DAMA concept, a pool of satellite transponder channels is assigned to a number of users. DAMA provides instant, dialup connectivity between a larger community of users and is an attractive option for any user looking for costeffective digital technology combined with the lowest equipment investment. Operating costs are also low since DAMA circuits are charged according to the amount of satellite resources actually used, on a perminute basis. TDMA is a digital service for public switched networks which require high connectivity on medium density traffic routes. DAMA is an attractive option for users who want the highest quality INTELSAT service because of higher stability, greater equipment flexibility and better digital bit error ratio BER than any other INTELSAT service. The quality and availability of this service is consistent with current fibre optic technology. The search for more capacity in a given bandwidth is shown in the following examples Antenna technology  More capacity is made available by designing antennas for higher microwave bands, and by reusing frequency bands with different polarizations and spatial beam separations. This technology is equally applicable to satellite and earth station designs. Low noise and high power amplifier technology As satellite transponders become more powerful and earth stations more sensitive, the number of communications channels that can be squeezed into a given bandwidth increases. High precision frequency oscillators and converters Digital communications systems are highly dependent on the stability and purity of oscillators and clock sources derived from the oscillators. For example, in highcapacity TDMA Time Division Multiple Access systems as used in satellite systems, the arrival time at the satellite transponder of transmitted bursts from numerous participating earth stations is controlled to within microseconds despite physical movements of the satellite, Doppler shifts and other propagation abnormalities. If this strict control was not possible, more guardtime between bursts would have to be allocated with an ensuing loss of channel carrying capacity. Modem technology An important development in modem technology is to reduce its CN CarriertoNoise threshold for a certain Bit Error Rate BER. If the modem is operating at a low CN ratio, it will need less power from the satellite, which means that the power can be used for additional satellite channels. Advancements in modem technology are also closely related to FEC Forward Error Correction technology. Use of Digital Signal Processing FEC technology is just one example of technology which can be implemented using digital signal processing. Other advancements in this field are the use of digital signal processing for the compressing and decompressing of signals to ever lower transmission rates. This technology is applied to any type of analogue signals such as voiceband channels or TV signals, and since lower transmission rates mean smaller transponder bandwidth the number of channels in a given bandwidth may be increased. An additional example of digital signal processing used in fixed satellite systems is in Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment DCME introduced in this section. By using this technology, the number of telephone or data channels carried by a satellite RF channel may be increased by a typical factor of 5.   Report on Question 162 57 2.4.1.2 Digital Circuit Multiplexing Equipment One of the major advantages of converting communications systems from analogue to digital technology is that it opens up a wide range of possibilities in signal processing. Three processing concepts which, when taken individually, have already made important improvements in digital communications, have had a significant impact on digital system designs when they are combined. These three processing concepts are 1 Low Rate Encoding LRE and compressiondecompression techniques, 2 Digital Speech Interpolation DSI, and 3 Forward Error Correction FEC techniques. The equipment which exploits the first two processes when combined is known as Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment DCME. FEC is incorporated in the RF digital carriers transmitted over the satellite link. The two main technologies combined in the DCME equipment, as mentioned above, are LRE and DSI. LRE refers to the reduction in the number of bits required to transmit a given piece of information. The standard 64 kbits PCM channel is produced by sampling an analogue input channel 8000 times per second and converting each sample to an 8bit PCM code. However, by using a variety of techniques, it is possible to significantly reduce the number of transmitted bits for each sample. The reduction is dependent on the required grade of service and whether speech, voicedata or signalling will be transmitted. A reduction from 64 kbits down to 8 kbits is possible, and the ITUT is developing a speech coder operating at 4 kbits. DSI uses dynamic assignment techniques, i.e. a time slot satellite channelis assigned to a particular international communication channel on demand, but the same time slot is not used for the duration of the telephone call. This technique is made possible by the fact that during a telephone conversation, the speech is not continuous and so the channel is not required all the time and therefore the time slot can be allocated to a different channel. The DSI circuits concentrate a number of terrestrial input channels generally known as trunk channels into a smaller number of time slots referred to as bearer channels or satellite channels. In the opposite transmission direction, the concentrated bearer channels are expanded into a larger number of trunk channels. The maximum number of satellite channels time slots is 61 81 under overload condition. TSI Time Slot Interchange in the DCME equipment is used as a static assignment technique, i.e. terrestrial channels are manually assigned to international channels until a manual reassignment is required. The terrestrial input lines to the DCME equipment are coming in 2 Mbits typically up to 10 carriers, which may contain many empty time slots. Therefore, the potential number of terrestrial channels typically 310 is higher than the 216 international channels that can be handled by the DSI circuits. The static assignment process TSI process is the manual procedure of picking out 216 international channels from the maximum 310 terrestrial channels. Hence, by static assignment techniques TSI, 216 international channels are picked out from among 310 terrestrial channels, and by dynamic assignment techniques DSI, the 216 international channels are compressed into 61 or 81 satellite channels. A certain trunk channel is connected to a certain bearer channel only for the time duration including an appropriate hangover time period that the trunk channel is active, i.e. while it is carrying a burst of speech or transmitting voiceband data or signalling. Taking account of the interval between speech bursts during a normal telephone conversation, the trunk channel will be active only for about 3040 of the time. For a large number of trunk channels, therefore, the number of bearer satellite channels can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2.53.0 by assigning the satellite bearers on demand. Preassignment of channels should, however, be possible in the equipment.  Frequent trunkbearer assignment information must be transmitted between the corresponding earth stations in order to make sure that the transmitting trunk channel is connected to the correct receiving trunk channel at the remote side for the duration of the telephone conversation, or voiceband data transmission. The information is exchanged in a special Assignment Channel AC. 58  Report on Question 162 On the terrestrial interface side, each DCME module is connected to an International Switching Centre ISC with up to ten 2 Mbits communications links total of 310 voice or data channels 64 kbits plus 20 synchronization and signalling channels. On the satellite interface side, each DCME module is connected to an Intermediate Data Rate IDR modem operating at 2.048 Mbits information data rate.  DCME equipment may be used in other than satellite communications systems for example submarine cables. If used for satellite applications, the operational modes are the following  Single Destination SD mode  MultiClique MC mode  MultiDestination MD mode  Mixed SDMD mode. The SD mode, as the name implies, is the simplest mode and is also the most economical for large users. The minimum requirement as far as DCMEIDR equipment is concerned, is one redundant set of DCME modules, and one redundant set of IDR modems. In addition, the required earth station equipment is upconverters and downconverters, lownoise amplifiers, power amplifiers and antenna. IDRDCME equipment may be implemented in a new earth station design or incorporated into an existing station. In the latter case, station facilities such as terrestrial microwave link, power plant, and air conditioning may already be available. In Multiclique operation, the satellite bearer channels on the transmit side are divided into one or two separate blocks, or cliques, each clique associated with a different destination. Since two destinations are served, the earth station will need two IDR demodulators. The two demodulators will provide the wanted as well as the unwanted channels at its output. In order to avoid sending the unwanted channels to the ISC and thereby reducing the capacity of the terrestrial link, only the wanted channels are picked out and sent to the ISC by a Digital Crossconnect or Digital Branch equipment. By placing the DCME equipment at the ISC rather than the earth station, the reduction in the number of required satellite channels is also extended to the terrestrial link. Multidestination operation may be used for up to 4 destinations per DCME set and is economical for small users with multidestination requirements. All satellite bearer channels are subject to DSI processing regardless of the channel destination. Figure 2.4.2. shows a system configuration with 4 destinations. In this example, one IDR modulator and 4 demodulators are required for one DCME equipment set. The DCME may be located at either the earth station or at the ISC. DCME in use on a satellite link should ensure provision for ISDN Integrated Services Digital Network bearer services. This means that the DCME must be transparent to circuit mode unrestricted 64 kbits terrestrial channels used with different access protocols. Likewise, the 64 kbits channel must be able to transmit 3.1 kHz voiceband data from modems. Furthermore, the DCME must handle alternate transmission of voice and data during the same call. 2.4.1.3 Highcapacity International Satellite Telephony and Data Systems The difference between satellite communications systems used for international links and for domestic or regional communications is primarily one of capacity. International earth stations are usually designed as highcapacity installations capable of handling from several hundreds to perhaps thousands of voice and data channels plus multiple TV channels. Domestic or regional systems, on the other hand are usually implemented for low to medium capacity perhaps from a few dozens to several hundreds channels, and a single TV channel. Whether an earth station is designed for high capacity international links or for low capacity domestic or regional communications, the technology used in the earth station equipment is basically the same. The difference is in sizing the equipment to the application on hand plus employing equipment that will increase the number of channels on high capacity links.    Report on Question 162 59  Figure 2.4.2    Basic concept of DCMEIDR multidestination operation      This section contains information on the various equipment subsystems that are included in a typical earth station. The differences that characterize the largecapacity earth station from its lowcapacity counterpart are the following  The physical size of the antenna is larger in order to increase the antenna gain and therefore the stations capacity. A typical antenna size is a diameter of 1618 meters. The figureofquality of the station is indicated in its GT figure, which is the receive antenna gain divided by the system thermal noise temperature in Kelvin. For example, a 16meter antenna operating at 4 GHz may have a receive gain of 3.16  105 55 dB and a noise temperature at its operating elevation angle of 100 K. This noise temperature has two major components, namely the Low Noise Amplifier LNA temperature for example 50 K, and the antenna noise temperature 50 K. This would give the station a GT of 35 dBK which is typical of an international earth station. The antenna feed and tracking equipment is identical to the ones described in the next section of this Handbook.  The High Power Amplifiers HPA need a higher rated output power. Since large international stations often will be transmitting 2 or more RF carriers through the same HPA, intermodulation considerations may dictate a rather large HPA power backoff and the HPA must be sized accordingly.  The modulators and demodulators must be able to handle high capacity information data streams of typically 2 048, 6 312, 8 448, 32 064, 34 368 and 44 736 Mbits. Even higher information rates such as 139.264 Mbits in the Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy PDH and 155.52 Mbits in the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy SDH may find roles in satellite communications systems.  Highcapacity earth stations are often implemented with Digital Circuit Multiplication Equipment DCME which takes advantage of channel Low Rate Encoding LRE and Digital Speech Interpolation DSI technologies in order to increase the number of voice channels or voiceband data channels in a given satellite transponder bandwidth by a factor of up to 5.0. 60  Report on Question 162 High Capacity Modems  Modulator and demodulator modem technology has made great advancements during the last few years. Development has focused on reducing the physical size of the equipment and integrating numerous functions into Large Scale Integration LSI circuits. Such functions include Forward Error Correction FEC technology that makes it possible to operate the demodulator at ever decreasing CarriertoNoise CN or Energyperbittonoise density EbNo ratios for a certain Bit Error Rate BER.  Modern highcapacity modems for earth stations are now available in a variety of configurations such as physically separate modulators and demodulators, combined modems, fixed transmission rate modems, variable rate modems, rackmounted or plugin card modems. In the combined modem configuration, one modem in each shelf is standby for the remaining 8 online modems with automatic and manual switchover control equipment built into the shelf. Likewise, IF combiners, dividers and a patchpanel are included in the shelf. In terms of channel capacity, then, one 210cm rack may hold up to 32 online modems with a total maximum capacity of 3840 voice andor data 64 kbits channels with 64 synchronization and signalling channels. In terms of capacity measured in bits per second, the total capacity of the rack is approximately 270 Mbits. Whether the modem is implemented as a separate unit or combined, it is capable of operating with FEC rates of 12, 34 and 78 and may be implemented with concatenated ReedSolomon coding technology. User interfaces are RS422449 or V.35 488448 kbits or ITUT Rec. G.703 15448448 kbits. For FEC rate 12 the demodulator will typically produce a BER of 1  106 or better at an EbNo of 6.1 dB. The corresponding EbNo figures for FEC R34 and FEC R78 are 7.6 dB and 8.7 dB, respectively. The modulator is using 4phase PSK Phase Shift Keying and the demodulator coherent 4phase PSK technologies. IF frequencies are either 70 or 140 MHz, and the modem is capable of tuning in 2.5, 22.5 or 25 kHz steps across the IF passband. Frequency stability is typically  1  106 per year. Furthermore, the modulator provides synchronization and ESC Engineering Service Channel signals for its corresponding demodulators, and drop and insert multiplexed signals are available in data rates between 64 and 1920 kbits. To keep demodulators in synchronization with modulators, PlesiochronousDoppler buffers may be included. The power consumption of a fully equipped shelf 9 modem units is approximately 0.8 KVA. Extensive local and remote monitoring and control facilities of highcapacity modems are essential for their proper operation. Table 2.4.1 and 2.4.2 show typical items, which may be monitored and controlled in modern modem designs.  2.4.1.4 Low to Mediumcapacity Regional and Domestic Satellite DOMSAT Systems With the liberalization of telecommunications policies that has swept the world in recent years and with the prospects of even more liberalization to come, new satellite systems are being implemented around the world by organizations that previously, under monopolistic policies, would have been prevented from setting up their own systems. These systems, which normally have higher traffic capacity than VSAT Very Small Aperture Terminal systems can provide, are generally implemented within the borders of a certain country Domsats but may also cover a region of countries.  With the proliferation of new satellite systems and migration to higher frequency bands, there is a requirement for a more flexibility in earth station system design, and for the development of affordable yet ultrareliable earth station subsystems since many stations will be operated unattended. Power consumption is also a significant aspect of new equipment design, because more and more earth stations will be using alternate primary power sources, such as solar power plants.

Flexibility in antenna technology can now be achieved by an antenna design that operates simultaneously in the Cband and the Ku bands, i.e. 64 and 1411 GHz bands. This is important because many modern satellites will be equipped with both FSS frequency band transponders. Furthermore, the flexibility is advantageous to TV uplink and cable restoration earth stations that occasionally have a need for accessing different satellites operating with either C or Kuband satellites, or both at the same time. Development of lownoise devices as the frontend of the earth station is focused on lowering the noise temperature, reducing the physical size, extending the Mean Time Between Failures MTBF, and making the devices maintenancefree and capable of operating without cooling. MTBF figures of 500,000 hours for modern LNA Low Noise Amplifiers are not uncommon. Highpower amplifiers have developed from klystrons and travelling wave devices to FET transistor amplifiers under the generic term Solid State Power Amplifiers SSPA. With this development, the physical size of the amplifiers has shrunk significantly, and the reliability has been extended enormously, primarily due to simpler power supply designs. Frequency converters are essential components in an earth station for converting between common IF frequency bands and the assigned RF frequencies in the satellite transponder. With the change of communications technology from analogue to digital, the performance of the converters has taken on new significance with respect to phase noise, linearity, spurious output signals and reliability. Modern frequency converters make extensive use of advanced technologies such as monolithic FET RF amplifiers, monolithic bipolar IF amplifiers, and thinfilm and thickfilm Microwave Hybrid Integrated Circuits MHIC. Modulators and demodulator designs are important in digital earth stations because they, to a large extent, determine the overall quality of a satellite link, and they have the capability to lower the amount of RF power needed from the satellite, and maintain the communications link at a high quality level. This is accomplished by sophisticated Forward Error Correction FEC schemes that, in effect, lower the threshold of the demodulator to very small values. Finally, centralized monitoring and control of one or several earth stations or a complete Domsat or regional system is important because the equipment is frequently unattended, not only in the main central earth station but very often also at remote stations under the control of the central station. A modern monitoring and control subsystem is computerized equipment typically one or more PCs operating in a Local Area Network from where a single operator can monitor and control all equipment in the main and remote earth stations. The software used for this purpose closely follows the development of moderntype windows software architectures with userfriendly manmachine interface. Combined CKuband Antenna Structures To cater for different earth station system designs and different frequency bands, combined C and Kuband parabolic antenna technology with simultaneous dualband, dualpolarization transmission and reception feeds is now available in antenna diameter sizes from 7.6 meters to 16 meters. Traditionally, dual circular polarization has been used at the 46 GHz Cbands, and linear dual polarization at the 111214 GHz Kubands. With the increasing demands on the frequency bands, it is anticipated that linear and circular polarizations will also be used in the C and Kubands, respectively. Likewise, it is anticipated that feed technology with switching between circular and linear polarizations will play a role in satellite systems.   Report on Question 162 63 Combined CKuband Feed The combined CKuband feed is where most new antenna technological development has been invested. Figure 2.4.3 shows the basic concept of a combined dualbanddual polarization parabolic antenna design. The feed is one integrated mechanical structure approximately 3 meters in length and containing only passive microwave devices.  Figure 2.4.3    Combined CKuband dual frequencydual polarization antenna feed      Table 2.4.3 gives the C and Kuband overall antenna transmit and receive gain figures in dB, and the thermal noise temperature in degrees Kelvin K.  Satellite Tracking Depending on the antenna diameter size of a given earth station and the movements of the applicable spacecraft, automatic manual satellite tracking may or may not be required, and the degree of sophistication in the tracking equipment may also vary from user to user.  At one end of the scale, small earth station terminals with antenna diameters of perhaps up to 56 meters and operating with highly geostationary satellites need no tracking equipment because their antenna beamwidth is so broad that the satellite never moves outside the beam. Or as a minimum tracking requirement, infrequent manual handcrank or motorized antenna reorientations may be performed.  At the other end of the scale, large earth station installation of the Intelsat StandardA class with antenna diameters of 16 meters or more, need automatic tracking equipment no matter what satellite will be used. This is due to the very narrow beamwidth of such stations. For example, a 16meter Kuband antenna will have a halfpower beamwidth in the order of 0.12 degrees at 11.2 GHz. Simple manual and automatic tracking capability is a minimum requirement for such stations if they operate with stable geostationary satellites, but the degree of sophisticated technology in tracking equipment increases rapidly if a given earth station is to be operated with less stable or nongeostationary satellites if the station is required to switch rapidly between two or more satellites if it is located in a geographical area that often suffers signal attenuation andor scintillations or even if it is to be operated with satellites in orbits which are stable but inclined to the geostationary orbit.  64  Report on Question 162  Table 2.4.3    Combined band overall antenna gain and thermal noise temperature  Combined CKuband Antenna Diameter Size7.6meter 9.2meter 11meter 13meter 16meterGain dB Gain dB Gain dB Gain dB Gain dB4.0 GHzreceive band 48.0 49.7 51.4 53.0 54.96.0 GHztransmit band 51.7 53.7 55.4 56.9 58.111.2 GHzreceive band 55.2 57.6 59.6 61.1 61.214.25 GHztransmit band 56.8 59.0 60.9 62.3 62.3Elevationdegrees 5 10 20 40 5 10 20 40 5 10 20 40 5 10 20 40 5 10 20 404 GHz thermalnoise K 59 46 40 37 58 45 39 36 57 44 38 35 56 44 38 35 58 46 41 3811.2 GHzthermal noise K 93 75 63 56 90 73 61 54 89 72 60 53 89 72 60 53 94 77 66 59   Satellite tracking technology has evolved from analogue monopulse concepts based on early radar technology, to modern digital computer controlled steptracking technology which is less expensive and technologically superior in the number of functions that can be implemented. Such functions are normally performed by a microprocessorcontrolled Antenna Control Unit ACU. As a minimum, the ACU may be implemented for manual motorized tracking only, in which case a beacon down converter and a beacon receiver is not required unless a beacon signal level indication is desired. If automatic tracking is implemented, the ACU will judge the beacon DC level at regular time intervals. If and when the signal level drops to a predetermined level, the ACU will initiate stepmovements of the antenna structure in azimuth and elevation until the signal level has been optimized. Such antenna movements are controlled from a Motor Control Unit which will apply power to antenna AC or DC drive motors. When the signal level is optimized, the ACU then will shut down the tracking equipment and wait for a predetermined time duration or until the signal level again is dropping.  Typically, one or more of the following tracking modes, depending on the applicable tracking requirements, may be implemented in a modern earth station  Manual Mode. From the front panel of the ACU, the earth station operator will manually move the antenna in azimuth and elevation to the desired antenna orientation.  Automatic Mode. The tracking system is operating completely automatic and will follow any movement of the satellite.  Preset Mode. The earth station operator will input from the front panel of the ACU a satellite position in azimuth and elevation. At the push of a button or at a predetermined time, the ACU will move the antenna to the preset position.   Report on Question 162 65  Program Mode. In this mode, the earth station operator will input 11 ephemeral data parameters provided by the satellite operator. The ACU uses these data to calculate and point the antenna to the satellite position at regular intervals.  Memory Mode. If this tracking mode is selected, autotracking must have been done for a minimum of the past 26 hours. The ACU will use this data to track the satellite from then on. This is done on the assumption that no, or very minor, orbit variations will occur from one day to the next.  Intelligent SelfLearning Program Tracking Mode. This mode which could appropriately be called an active tracking mode is a further development from the memory tracking mode passive. In this intelligent mode, the ACU will analyse the tracking data for the previous 24 hours and based on the result will predict the satellite position from then on. This mode is more accurate than any other mode including automatic tracking. Furthermore, it reduces wear and tear on the antenna mechanical components because the equipment is not activated as often. It may be operated without a beacon signal, and is particularly useful for earth station sites that suffer frequent scintillation problems. The sophistication of the ACU and tracking system as a whole may be appreciated when it is considered that it has no way of knowing whether a DC signal drop is because 1 the satellite is moving out of the antenna main beam, 2 the earth station antenna main beam is being reoriented, for example due to strong winds, 3 the beacon signal is suffering propagation abnormalities in amplitude and phase particularly applicable to the 1411 GHz systems, 4 the beacon signal is absent or faulty. The ACU must accommodate and solve all of these problems.  Low Noise AmplifiersConverters Successful satellite communications links rely on a tiny low noise Gallium Arsenide GaAs Field Effect Transistor FET installed at the frontend of an amplifier chain mounted in the antenna structure in close proximity to the feed. The amplifier chain is referred to as the Low Noise Amplifier LNA. In some cases the received signals from the satellite are frequency downconverted in the same physical unit, in which case the frontend amplifier is referred to as a Low Noise Converter LNC. Low noise amplifier technology for satellite communications has evolved from narrowband diode amplifiers physically cooled by liquid nitrogen or helium, to modern broadband GaAs FET devices that require no cooling at all. At the same time, the physical size of the LNA has shrunk so that the amplifier practically is being built into the waveguide, in some designs. At the Kuband, earth stations may be implemented with either Kuband LNAs of LNCs. If LNAs are selected, one amplifier unit is typically of the same physical dimensions as a Cband LNA. Such an LNA unit may have a noise temperature in the range of 80K through 180K and an overall gain of 55 dB. Depending on the application, the bandwidth of the LNA may be extremely wide, for example to cover all FSS frequency bands 10.9512.75 GHz. If the Kuband earth station is implemented with a Low Noise Converter LNC as its frontend amplifier, the incoming 1112 GHz signals from the satellite are downconverted in the LNC to a fixed IF band usually located around 1.01.5 GHz. Noise temperatures and gain are typically in the same order as the LNAs, i.e. 80K through 180K and gain of 55 dB depending on the application. High Power Amplifiers HPAs For earth stations that require FSS frequency band transmit power in the kilowatts, the High Power Amplifier HPA mainstay is the Travelling Wave Tube TWT or Klystron amplifiers. The design to choose for a particular application is dictated by technical characteristics, investment and operating costs. 66  Report on Question 162 With the advance of solid state technology, HPAs are increasingly being implemented in earth stations with Field Effect Transistor FET amplifiers which are slowly migrating from the lower microwave frequency bands to the Ku and higher bands with increasing power outputs. These amplifiers are generally assigned the generic name SSPAs Solid State Power Amplifiers, and their significance is due to good technical performance, low power consumption and high reliability. For the same reasons, they are also increasingly being used as power amplifiers in modern satellite transponders. A current stateoftheart High Power Amplifier implemented in a new earth station should include the following features  High reliability and MTBF Mean Time Between Failures  High gain and high gain stability  Low intermodulation distortion  Low power consumption  Low AMPM conversion  Low residual AM and phase noise  Low input surge current  Low spurious output signals  Simple operation and maintenance procedures  Adequate fault and status indicators  Adequate protection and alarm circuitry with logic sequencing to prevent misoperation  Autorecycling for automatic restart after power outages or other reasons  Compact and integrated packaging  Ability to be integrated into a redundant transmit chain with automatic switchover between online and standby HPAs  Ability to be monitored and controlled remotely. Depending on which satellite is to be used and at what frequency band, the proper choice of HPA for a particular earth station can be made. Table 2.4.4 shows typical HPA output power capabilities at the frequency bands allocated to satellite communications and for the 3 main types of amplifier devices. Frequency Converters With the transformation of satellite communications from analogue to digital technology, the earth stations frequency converters have taken on increased importance. Frequency converters include upconverters and downconverters for conversion between the RF bands and an IF band. The purpose of the upconverter is to place one or several RF carriers within the frequency passband of the satellite transponder assigned in the transmit direction. Similarly, the purpose of the downconverter is to receive one or several RF carriers within the frequency passband of a transponder assigned for the receive direction. As such, the upconverters and downconverters are normally tuned to the transponders centre frequency. The IF is fixed at either 70 or 140 MHz. If operation with a standard 36 MHz satellite transponder is anticipated, an IF of 70 MHz will suffice. If it is desired to operate with wider frequency band transponders, like 72 MHz, an IF of 140 MHz is more appropriate.

Furthermore, the downconverter should be able to incorporate Automatic Gain Control AGC and Automatic Frequency Control AFC if not included in the basic design. Figure 2.4.4 shows a typical 12 GHz tripleconversion downconverter. 68  Report on Question 162 High reliability and MTBF figures can be assured by using thinfilm and thickfilm Microwave Hybrid Integrated Circuits MHIC as well as monolithic circuits such as GaAs FET and bipolar transistor amplifiers. For ease and flexibility of operation, a synthesized local oscillator should be used rather than a fixed preassigned local oscillator. Furthermore, a triple conversion design is advantageous for reducing the frequency steps in which the upconverter or downconverter can be tuned across its designed passband.  Figure 2.4.4    Block diagram of Kuband triple conversion downconverter     Modulators and Demodulators Digital modulators and demodulators for domestic and regional satellite systems do not differ much in technology from their counterparts used in highcapacity systems as described in another section of this Handbook. The difference is rather in the amount of traffic they can carry. A smallcapacity domestic satellite system may be implemented with only a few preassigned digital voice channels, which may operate with an information rate of only 16 kbits. A higher capacity system may be designed for several hundred voice and data channels. Since it is not likely that all channels will be active at the same time and are not required between same geographical locations every time they are used, each channel may not be allocated permanent frequency space in the satellite transponder. Rather, the satellite channels will be assigned on demand, i.e. the satellite system will have a centralized Demand Assignment Multiple Access DAMA subsystem which will assign the channels as they are required. This will save satellite transponder bandwidth, and therefore operating costs for the operator of the satellite system. Television programme distribution is a vital part of many domestic satellite systems, and with the currently available powerful satellite transponders, programmes can be provided to small rooftop TV receivers. Analogue TV transmission has been used since the beginning of satellite communications and is still being implemented in new earth station installations primarily due to the large amount of analogue TV receivers in operation in most countries. However, analogue TV will slowly be supplanted with digital TV which, when used with modern compression techniques such as MPEG2, makes more efficient use of satellite bandwidth and power. Modulators and demodulators for digital TV will have data rates according to the image and sound quality desired. For example, a data rate of 64 kbits might be acceptable for a private PCtoPC video conference, whereas a system that has to deliver studioquality image and sound material would have to operate at a data rate of 2 Mbits or higher.    Report on Question 162 69 Centralized Monitor and Control System In line with modern developments in operating and maintaining complex communications systems, sophisticated earth station Monitoring and Control MC systems are often implemented such that one or more earth stations may be operated and maintained from a central location. This may or may not be at the location of the earth stations. Such systems are also referred to as Computerized Station Management Systems CSMS. MC functions may be further extended to include monitoring and control of remote earth stations, which are under the control of one central earth station in a domestic or regional satellite system. A modern CSMS system for monitoring and controlling an earth station or complex of several earth stations should include the following features  It should be tailormade to the application on hand. The complexity of a modern earth station is such that a standard MC system may not function very well.  It should be comprehensive and cover the operation and maintenance of all equipment subsystems, whether the equipment is produced by one manufacturer, or includes equipment from several vendors. It should also be able to monitor auxiliary equipment such as fire and smoke detectors, and intruder detectors.  It should have a high degree of flexibility. If the earth station is being reconfigured due to expansion or replacement of equipment, the CSMS should be able to be reconfigured as well, by earth station maintenance personnel, and without reprogramming of the CSMS software. A training function would also be a very useful feature.  It should have extensive logging functions so that the performance of the earth stations can be analysed offline.  It should be easy to learn to operate. This means that it should use standard hardware to the extent possible, and it should use a standard computer userfriendly operating system which is in line with modern software developments. 2.4.1.5 VSAT Systems A satellite VSAT Very Small Aperture Terminal system is an attractive solution for voice and data communications needs when the requirement is to have limited capacity from each location, but where the number of locations may run into the thousands. The flexibility of VSAT systems is such that it may be implemented very rapidly for a few sites and then gradually expanded as traffic grows or economic conditions allow. Therefore, this type of communications media is ideally suited for rural communications, when each small community may have requirements for only a few voice and data channels, but where there may be hundreds or perhaps even thousands of such communities scattered across the country.  The VSAT solution is also attractive when, in addition to voice and data communications, there is a need for oneway TV and radio broadcasting for educational or other purposes. In such cases, the remote VSAT terminals will serve not only as transmit and receive stations for voice and data, but also as TV and radio broadcast receiveonly stations. Furthermore, the digital data channels in modern VSAT terminals may be configured ondemand to serve specific purposes. This opens up a whole new spectrum of applications of which teleconferencing in general and telemedicine in particular are perhaps some of the most important. For example, a semiskilled medical team with a video camera and medical equipment suitable for data communications, might visit VSAT communities on a regular basis. During the visit, twoway satellite video and voice channels will be made available for consultations between patients and skilled medical staff at central locations in the country.  70  Report on Question 162 The flexibility of VSAT systems extends to accommodate various types of traffic requirements. For example, some organizations private or public may have requirements for 1 voice communications and continuous data communications channels with various transmission rates, among many locations whereas other organizations may have a need for 2 rapid and frequent interactive data communication, and occasional batch data transmission at fixed transmission rates between one central computer and many remote locations or, 3 other organizations may have immediate requirements for both types of communications. Under traffic requirements, the routing of the traffic should also be examined. The VSAT system should be able to handle 4 star traffic in which all or most traffic flows between one central hub station and the remote VSAT terminals, andor 5 mesh traffic, in which all or most traffic is evenly distributed among the VSAT terminals and the hub station. Also, 6 broadcast mode should be supported, in which the hub or control station is able to transmit to all or a predetermined group of VSAT terminals simultaneously. Finally, 7 it should be possible to implement digital or analogue television signal transmission by using the same RF equipment at the hub station and at the VSAT terminals, as used for the voice and data channels. A well designed VSAT system should be able to implement all communications functions as outlined above. It should be able to handle various transmission rates between its users. Furthermore, the VSAT system should be able to use the available satellite channel transponder or fraction of a transponder in an economical way with respect to power, bandwidth and time. Finally, the VSAT system must be well managed, monitored and controlled. Satellite transponder power is conserved by implementing the VSAT system with efficient Forward Error Correction FEC coding schemes which will allow the systems demodulators to operate at a very low CarriertoNoise CN ratio and therefore need reduced transponder power. Furthermore, if the system is implemented for voice communications, the voice coding should be done at the lowest rate commensurate with the desired voice quality. Since it is preferred that the VSAT system can accommodate various transmission rates for data as well as voice channels between its users, the satellite transponder bandwidth should be assigned on demand. This BandwidthonDemand BOD concept should be extended to transmission rates between any modulator and demodulator in the system. The satellite transponders time should be used as efficiently as possible. This may be accomplished by implementing the VSAT system to be operated under DAMA Demand Assignment Multiple Access control, whereby satellite circuits voice or data are assigned only on demand i.e. when needed.  For the VSAT system to function reliably, smoothly and with the minimum number of skilled personnel, it should have a builtin central Network Management System NMS from where the system can be managed, monitored and controlled. VSAT systems may be implemented in the satellite communications allocated Cband as well as Kubands. Significant technological advancement has gone into the development of the hardware and software used in VSAT systems. Systems may be implemented as new standalone projects, or they be integrated into already existing earth station equipment, thus saving capital and implementation time.  A detailed description of one particular implementation of a VSAT System is given in Annex A. 2.4.1.6 Transportable DSNG TV Earth Station Transmission System To meet the growing demand for onthespot TV coverage, equipment with video and sound compression techniques according to MPEG2 more specifically ISOIEC 138182 standards is now available in a very compact form. To keep the dimensions and weight down to manageable levels and to take advantage of modern day high powered satellites, the equipment operates in the Kubands allocated to satellite communications. The equipment can be broadly categorized into the Outdoor Unit ODU, and the Indoor Unit IDU.   Report on Question 162 71 The Outdoor Unit The ODU contains the antenna which, depending on the available satellite capability, may be a 75 or 120 cm diameter design typically operating in the 14.014.5 GHz transmit band, and the 12.2512.75 GHz receive band. The stations frontend low noise transistor amplifierconverter subsystem has a nominal noise temperature of 120K, and the station will have a GT of approximately 15.25 dBK at 40 degrees elevation, and using the 75 cm antenna. The transmit equipment includes a high power TWT amplifierconverter which, depending on the satellite capability, has a nominal output power of 50 or 100 watts. The maximum transmitted power from the station saturated EIRP will be approximately 54 dBW by using the 75 cm antenna and the 50watt amplifier.  Satellite tracking is done manually, and the station is able to move freely 360 degrees in azimuth, and between 25 and 55 degrees in elevation. It will operate in wind up to 20 meterssecond, and the weight of the ODU is approximately 50 kg. The Indoor Unit The IDU equipment is also housed in a weatherproof container of weight 60 kg and dimensions 52.2W  49.4H  50.2D centimetres. It is powered by 115 or 200 VAC and consumes approximately 1 kVA including the ODU equipment. It accepts standard composite NTSC or PAL video and audio signals of levels 1 Vpp and 0 dBm, respectively. These signals are compressed to one of four video coding rates, selectable by the operator of the equipment.  The video coding rate selected is primarily dependent on the available satellite power and bandwidth. Table 2.4.5 shows a table of the parameters used by the 4 different transmission modes. What is shown as the Normal mode, corresponds roughly to the video and sound quality of a typical household receiver. In this mode, the video coding rate is 7 Mbits and the transmission rate over the satellite is 11.3 Mbits. By using a convolutional Forward Error Correction FEC rate of 34, the required satellite transponder bandwidth is 8 MHz. Thus, 3 additional and similar TV carriers can be accommodated in a standard 36 MHz transponder, provided it has enough power. The demodulator will produce an output data stream with a BER Bit Error Rate of 1  108 or better at a received CarriertoNoise ratio CN of 6.8 dB. In transmission systems where the power from the satellite transponder is severely limited, the operator can select the Threshold Mode, in which case the video coding rate is reduced and the transmission rate is increased compared with the Normal mode. The increase is due to the use of FEC rate 12, and the demodulator is able to operate at a CN of only 3.6 dB for the same BER as for the Normal mode.  If enough satellite transponder power and bandwidth is available, the operator may select the Medium or High Quality modes of transmission which use the transmission parameters as indicated in the table. The Medium Quality mode is roughly equivalent to the image quality produced by todays full transponder analogue FM TV transmissions. The High Quality mode will produce images and sounds which, although not comparable to High Definition TV HDTV, will satisfy most users. Audio is provided at a bit rate of 384 kbits, either as 2 monaural channels or as 1 stereo channel. Orderwire communications are included with four 32 kbits voice channels and one 64 kbits data channel. Mobile Transportable Earth Station The equipment as described above may be modified and installed in a road vehicle. It may for example be a jeeptype vehicle, approximately 5 meters long and 1.8 meters wide. In this case, the antenna can be mounted on the roof of the vehicle, and the IDU is installed in the rear of the car. The antenna typically has a diameter of 1.2 meters. The HPC is typically a 100watt TWT, and the LNC has a typical noise temperature of 80K. The IDU equipment is essentially identical to the IDU used in the portable earth station. 72  Report on Question 162  Table 2.4.5    Transportable DSNG earth station main transmission parameters    2.4.2 Technology for Mobile GSO Satellite Systems From the beginning of commercial satellite communications 1965, the benefits of using satellites in geostationary orbits have outweighed the disadvantages. One of these disadvantages is the enormous free space propagation loss between the earth station and the satellite. Because of this disadvantage, earth stations have traditionally tended to be rather large installations, and only in recent years has the satellite communications technology matured to the point where it is now practical to use handcarried portable terminals with geostationary satellites. Inmarsat, the international organization with 79 member countries charged with providing maritime satellite communications, has led the way in providing land and air mobile communications. The equipment standards set up by the Inmarsat organization for accessing their satellites largely reflect the progression of technology and the physical size of the terminals. The ultimate goal, which will be realized with geostationary as well as nongeostationary satellites, is a handheld global communications terminal that fits into a pocket.  The InmarsatA terminal is still the most widespread communications terminal for mobile communications. It uses analogue technology and can support highquality direct dial telephone, telex, facsimile and data services 9.6 and 64 kbits. Portable versions of this standard equipment fit into one or two suitcases and use folding antennas. The InmarsatB terminal is the successor to the Aterminal and provides similar services. It uses digital technology and is therefore smaller, lighter and cheaper to buy, and has reduced user charges. Data services are provided up to 64 kbits. The InmarsatC terminal is a small a few kg twoway data terminal and is the only terminal with an omnidirectional antenna. It may be used in fixed, mobile, transportable, maritime and aeronautical versions. It supports storeandforward message, text and data reporting communications at a rate of 600 bits. The InmarsatM system also uses digital technology and provides directdial telephone, facsimile or 2.4 kbits data services. The physical size of StandardM terminals has already progressed from the size of a small suitcase 11 kg to the size of a notebook computer about 2.6 kg. Further details on equipment used in the InmarsatM system are provided in Annex B.

The orbits of the various satellites in the constellation are designed to provide full global coverage. The nonGSO systems may occupy low earth orbits or medium to intermediate earth orbits. Satellite constellations are tailored to provide specific regional or global coverage. Globalstar is an example of applying spacecraft constellation geometry and astrodynamics to achieve a fullearth service area. Since nonGSO satellites are closer to the earth than GSO satellites, they can achieve their function with smaller antennas and lower power per communications cell. The nonGSO satellites also enjoy less delay as signals from the earth travel and back to the ground have a shorter propagation delay. A number of complex issues arise however e.g. the limited duration of visibility to a tracking, telemetry and command earth station. Ground resources, including spacecraft control and telemetry support, must be scheduled for contact times as these moving satellites come into view of an earth station antenna. The advancement of technology in all fields used by satellite communications has resulted in increasingly more powerful and sensitive satellites, and shrinking physical size of earth stations. It was perhaps inevitable that the earth station eventually would be reduced to the size of a handheld telephone set. This is still not possible by using satellites in geostationary orbits due to the very large propagation path length resulting in signal attenuation loss and delay. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the geostationary orbit satellites, communications systems may be implemented by using low earth orbit LEO or medium earth orbit MEO constellations. Technology at the end of the 20th century has matured to the point where such systems may be implemented with small handheld earth stations. In fact, handsets will be designed for both terrestrial and satellite use with automatic switchover between the two systems. Orbit Constellations If a LEO orbit constellation is used, the satellite altitude is selected much lower, typically between 700 and 2000 km. The orbit period in this case will be somewhere between 100 and 120 minutes. Due to the lower altitude, the view of the world from the satellite is rather small and the number of planes to cover the entire globe will have to be increased to 68, and the number of satellites must be 612. The number of orbiting satellites, therefore becomes rather large. Space Segments The satellites may be implemented as simple repeater amplifiers with frequency conversion or they may have onboard signal processing capabilities. The design life of the satellites obviously has an impact on the operating costs of any system implementation. The LEO orbiting satellites must be replaced more often than the MEO orbiting spacecraft, and the span of lifetime, therefore, may be in the order of 515 years. In order to produce adequate power on the ground, satellites will be implemented with a large number of spot beams. This calls for rather complicated synchronization and Handingoff procedures by the controlling gateway stations, since a telephone subscriber while on conversation may find himself illuminated by 2 or more sweeping satellite beams. Frequency Plan Communications links between gateway stations and a satellite will use frequencies in the C or Ku bands. Furthermore, Ka bands are also used around 30 GHz for the uplinks, and 20 GHz for the downlinks. 74  Report on Question 162 As some of the frequency bands used are shared with GSO systems, there is a need for a balance between protecting the existing GSO services, and allowing new nonGSO systems to operate without undue constraint. Further agreements were reached at the World Radiocommunication Conference 2000 in Istanbul including some limits on earth stations of GSO networks, and power limits for nonGSO systems which define the rules of sharing the Ku band 1018 GHz User Terminals There will be a variety of user terminals employed in the LEOMEO satellite systems. The bulk of user terminals will be small handheld telephone sets that in many cases will be compatible with terrestrial cellular standards. The initial users will probably be international travellers who will be able to get a dial tone from anywhere in the world. Other subscribers such as users in remote areas where there is currently nonexistent or very poor telecommunications infrastructure will follow. Other terminals such as fixed terminals in village telephone booths, aircraft, ship or private residences will be used as well. Furthermore, multiline units with several users sharing a single terminal will be developed. In most cases user terminals will be capable of interactive voice and voiceband data communications, such as facsimile, PC communications, and in some cases video conferencing. Noninteractive communications in the form of worldcovering oneway pagers that will be able to alert users and display alphanumeric messages will also be available. 2.4.3.1 System Description In the Annexes to Chapter 2.4 a number of LEOMEO satellite communications systems are presented in some detail. Other systems are under preparation, and the inclusion of the above systems should not be seen as an endorsement, but rather as an attempt to illustrate representative system configurations. The description and details presented for each system is not exhaustive. Thus, the inclusion of certain equipment and functions for one system does not necessarily mean that the same equipment and functions are not included in the other systems, even if not described. 2.4.4 Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite GMPCS The term Global Mobile Personal Communications by Satellite GMPCS refers to all communications systems that provide services directly to end users from a constellation of satellites. GMPCS represents the next stage in the development of wireless telephony, integrating the longdistance capabilities of satellites with the mobility of cellular phones. It accomplishes this by incorporating within portable user terminals all transmitting and receiving functions traditionally fulfilled by fixed earth station gateways and replacing terrestrial wireless networks with satellites. GMPCS uses geostationary and nongeostationary, regional and global, fixed and mobile satellite systems to interconnect individual user terminals. GMPCS systems are thus capable of transmitting any type of telephone transmission, i.e. voice, data, fax, or paging, to a destination anywhere in the world. GMPCS thus embraces many of the systems and services addressed in this Chapter.  Further information is available in the ITU GMPCS Reference Book, December 1999. 2.4.5 Global Satellite Positioning Systems Global Satellite Positioning Systems use satellites to provide highly accurate positioning data for a wide range of applications such as navigation on land, in the air, at sea and in space, national security, and new consumer oriented position determination applications.  The World Radiocommunications Conference 2000 provided additional allocations for radionavigation satellite services. The additional spectrum makes it possible for the two current systems, Russias Global Navigation Satellite System GLONASS and the USA Global Positioning System GPS to develop into more accurate second generation systems, while providing room for Europes new system, Galileo.

The Hub or Control Station The Hub VSAT equipment may be constructed as a new earth station or it may be integrated into existing earth station equipment at the GCE level. For example, the existing equipment at the earth station may include a 13meter antenna, Low Noise Amplifiers LNA, High Power Amplifiers HPA, Upconverters and Downconverters, Multiplexers MUX, RF combiners, RF dividers, and 140 Mbits digital radio link to the International Transmission Maintenance Centre ITMC.  The equipment to be added to the Hub station for VSAT operations is the following subsystems  Upconverters and downconverters for the applicable C or Ku frequency bands.  Voice and data channel modems. These may be plugin cards for continuous voice and data communications with various data transmission rates. For example, the voice modems are typically able to operate at 16 and 32 kbits information coding rates, and the data modems at various rates between 9.62048 kbits. Each individual modem can be set to the desired transmission rate BandwidthonDemand function. It should be noted that the duration of a continuous type of communications channel in contrast to an interactive type of communications does not necessarily mean a permanently assigned communications channel. It may be assigned for the duration of a telephone call, forever, or for any length of predetermined time desired.  The DAMA subsystem, in which the satellite transponder circuits are assigned on demand for voice or data communications either between the Hub and VSAT stations star configuration, or between individual VSAT terminals mesh configuration. The DAMA subsystem is communicating with remote VSAT terminals on a continuous TDM Time Division Multiplex Common Signalling Channel CSC outbound or transmit communications, and by Time Division Multiple Access TDMA bursts from the VSAT terminals inbound or receive communications. Modern DAMA equipment can control thousands of VSAT terminals.   The AATDMA Adaptive AssignmentTime Division Multiple Access subsystem in which rapid and frequent interactive communications is implemented with the remote VSAT terminals. The modes of communications with the remote VSAT terminals are the same as for DAMA operations, i.e. TDM outbound and TDMA inbound.  Data Voice Multiplex DVM equipment, in which the VSAT communications channels are interfaced to the existing digital MUX equipment. This interface is done at 2048 kbits to the existing MUX, but at various data rates to the VSAT Hub equipment.  The Network Management System NMS, from where the entire VSAT network can be managed, monitored and controlled. The NMS consists of a powerful workstation computer with applicable software for VSAT System Monitoring and Control, VSAT User Monitoring and Control, and for Billing management. 78  Report on Question 162 Voice Channels at the Hub Station The voice channels may be configured from the NMS for either 16 or 32 kbits information rate. Furthermore, this information rate may be reduced to 8 kbits in the future without any hardware change. Implementation to 8 kbits is done simply by downloading information from the NMS to the hub station equipment and individual VSAT terminals. The 16 or 32 kbits voice channels at the hub station are input and output tofrom the BOD voice channel modems as analogue channels.  At the ITMC, similar DVM equipment as at the Hub station is implemented for the analoguedigital conversion between the analogue telephone channels from the telephone exchange and the existing digital radio MUX equipment. The interface here is also at 2 Mbits. In the voice operations mode, one unit of DVM equipment is typically capable of handling a maximum of 30 voice channels.  Data Channels at Hub Station The BOD data channels may also be configured from the NMS for data channel rates between 9.6 and 2048 kbits. Since the interface at the hub station to the existing digital radio link MUX equipment is done at 2 Mbits, rate conversion is required. This rate conversion is done in the Data Voice MUX equipment mentioned in the previous paragraphs.  The DVM equipment has 5 plugin cards. For voice operation, each card can handle 6 voice channels for a total of 30 voice channels. For data channel operations, depending on the data rate, each card can handle 24 channels per card. The DVM can operate with a mixture of voice and data channels, but in no case can the aggregate bit rate from all input channels exceed 2048 kbits, which is the output data rate.  Interactive AATDMA Data Channels at the Hub Station The interactive, frequent bursts of information to be transmitted to remote VSAT terminals are coming from a host frontend computer which is located at the premises of the user or owner of the VSAT system. The TDM data channel used for the outbound communications is typically operating at 64 or 128 kbits, and the return burst of information from the VSAT terminals are typically coming at 64 kbits. Since the host computer is not at the earth station or even at the ITMC, multiplex equipment must also be included at the earth station and the ITMC to handle the interactive AATDMA channel. VSAT Terminals Depending on the required frequency bands and transmission capacity of the remote VSAT stations, antenna sizes of 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.7 meters are typically used. The Low Noise Converters LNC at Cband may have a 60 K noise temperature, and 140 K at Kuband. High Power Converters HPC at Cband may use Solid State Power Amplifiers SSPA of 3, 10 or 20 watts rated output power, and similar devices for the Ku band may be rated at 1, 2 or 6.6 watts. The size of the antenna, and the LNC and SSPA ratings for a certain terminal, are not only dependent on the number of transmitted carriers, but also on whether the carriers are directed to the Hub station only star configuration or to other VSAT terminals mesh configuration. If most of the carriers are transmitted to the Hub station, the size of the VSAT station can be minimized, or alternately, the number of carriers can be increased. This will also directly influence the power consumption and the cost of the VSAT terminal. VSAT terminals, particularly if they are used for rural communications, are often implemented with solar power plants. Table 1 shows the Cband transmit capability and power consumption of various terminals operating with an Intelsat7 type satellite.   Report on Question 162 79  Table 1    Terminal CBand transmit capabilities    The VSAT terminals may be implemented initially with only the antenna, the ODE and the Main Indoor Unit. The IDU is a container that may be placed on a tabletop and has no particular installation requirements. It contains up to 5 plugin voicedata modems, of which one is used as the Common Signalling Channel CSC for communications with the Hub station. The Main IDU may be expanded with a total of 2 subIDUs for a total of 15 plugin modems including the CSC modem.  The Main IDU also may be expanded with the AATDMA Indoor Unit for interactive communications with the Hub station. The major components in this IDU are the Satellite Channel Interface SCI unit modem, frequency synthesizer, a Baseband Processor BBP interface unit, an Operations Panel OPP, and a power module. Although the VSAT terminals are generally considered to be lowcapacity earth stations, the capacity for each terminal is limited not so much by the equipment, as by the transmitted power, or alternately by the receive sensitivity of the satellite transponder. If the 15 channels in one VSAT terminal are implemented with data modems and each set to 2048 kbits, the number of 64 kbits channels that theoretically can be transmitted is 450 channels. If these 64 kbits channels were to be used with Low Rate Encoding LRE equipment, which is currently available with acceptable quality at 16 kbits, one VSAT terminal would theoretically be able to transmit 1800 channels.  Analogue or Digital TV Distribution from the Hub Station Analogue or digital television may be transmitted from the Hub station by using the same RF equipment as the VSAT channels at the Hub station and at the remote VSAT terminals. However, if analogue TV is used, the VSAT antenna size may have to be increased. As an attractive alternative, digital TV services can be included economically because the antenna sizes as outlined in this example may be used for the VSAT terminals with no modifications being required to the terminals. A TV receiver is connected directly to the IDU at 1 GHz IF level. Network Management System NMS  The VSAT network is controlled technically as well as managerially from the Hub earth station, although the NMS functions can be performed remotely from some other location for example the ITMC.  The main functions performed by the NMS can be broadly categorized as follows 1 Network Status Monitoring. 2 Network Configuration Management. 3 Network Control. ANT ODE No. of channels Prime power consumption 1.8 M  5 W  5 337 W 1.8 M 20 W  5 500 W 2.4 M  5 W  5 337 W 2.4 M 20 W 10 700 W 3.7 M  5 W  5 337 W 3.7 M 20 W 10 700 W 80  Report on Question 162 4 Network Reliability switchover functions. 5 Alarm Management. 6 Statistics Management. 7 Logging Management. Power Generating Equipment  The VSAT terminal equipment is very compact and requires no special shelter. The ODE unit is installed directly on the antenna structure, and the IDU cases may be located at any convenient place up to 80 meters from the antenna. This distance may be extended if low resistance cables are used.  The IDU will operate normally up to a temperature of 40 C, and it is therefore not necessary to provide air conditioning except in extreme cases. If the prime power source is unreliable or not available, the VSAT terminals can be operated by solar generating power plants. Typical power consumption of the VSAT equipment was shown in a previous Table. Alternately, a small mobile diesel generator may be used.                     Report on Question 162 81 ANNEX  2B  The Inmarsat system The Inmarsat A, B, C and M standards are used for equipment in maritime or landbased services. Additional equipment standards for aeronautical services are the following  AeroC for storeandforward text and data messages to be sent and received by aircraft anywhere in the world.   AeroL for lowgain realtime dataonly communications service for flightdeck and airline operations purposes.   AeroH for highgain service providing multiplechannel flightdeck voice and passenger telephony.  Additional Inmarsat standards in preparation are InmarsatD, which is a pager system, and AeroI which is a mobile voice and data service using smaller, lighter and less expensive avionics equipment and antennas designed for short and mediumhaul aircraft. Calls originated from any of the standard equipment in the Inmarsat system must be routed through a Land Earth Station LES, sometimes called coast earth stations or aeronautical ground earth stations. Numerous LESs are located worldwide in the Atlantic Ocean Region AOR, Indian Ocean Region IOR and Pacific Ocean Region POR.  It should be noted that the Inmarsat system is not designed to provide direct service from one mobile terminal to another. Rather, it is intended for a mobile terminal to communicate via a LES with subscribers connected to a public switched telephone or data network. Hence, if a communications link is set up between two mobile terminals, it will suffer a satellite double hop propagation delay which is unsatisfactory for telephone connections, but may be of little significance for data communications links.  If the purpose of rural communications is to establish voice andor data links with urban centres that are already well connected to an LES, the InmarsatM system may currently be the fastest and least expensive way to integrate rural communities into an existing public communications network for purposes of trade, telemedicine, personal relationships and a host of other communications needs. If, however, the purpose is primarily for intercommunications between locations within or between rural communities, other communications architectures may be more appropriate.  A Portable Terminal for the InmarsatM System The Inmarsat3 series of satellites will eventually comprise 5 spacecraft covering all ocean areas. The transponders on the Inmarsat3 satellites when used with spot beams are powerful enough to allow small notebooksize terminals to operate with an LES station and thus be connected to the international public telecommunications network. The terminal uses the standard Inmarsat transmit frequency band of 1626.5 to 1660.5 and receive band of 1525.0 to 1559.0 MHz. Voice channels are available and encoded at 4.8 kbits by using advanced multiband excitation techniques. Facsimile may be transmitted and received using the G3 standard at 2.4 kbits, and asynchronous data transmission is available up to 2.4 kbits. 82  Report on Question 162 A builtin rechargeable lithium ion battery is used to power the equipment. When fully charged it will power the terminal for 4.5 hours in receive mode and for about 1.2 hours in transmit mode. It may be recharged from a 90260 VAC or 12 VDC source. Operating the terminal is fairly simple. The planar antenna, is pointed towards the satellite location for the ocean area where the terminal is located. By depressing the Menu button on the handset, the builtin LCD display on the handset will display the signal strength of signals coming from the satellite. By reorienting the antenna, the terminal may be set to receive maximum signal strength. If the direction to the satellite is unknown, a compass will aid the user in the initial orientation. An icon display will indicate that the terminal is locked on to a satellite. The Base Unit of the Portable Terminal The base unit of the portable terminal consists of the transmit and receive electronics, the antenna, the rechargeable battery and the cradle for the handset. The handset cradle may be detached and connected to the base unit by a cable up to 4.5 meters long so that the user of the terminal may be at his workplace while the base unit and antenna may be placed near a window. Furthermore, the antenna may also be detached and placed up to 10 meters from the base unit.  The handset cradle also serves as a connection point for a fax machine, an external telephone or a personal computer. The base unit also contains a socalled SIM Subscriber Identity Module card reader. The SIM card is a smart card about the size of a credit card with an embedded electronic chip which provides enhanced security and many value added features such as 1 personalized electronic phone book which can be easily edited and used for speed dialling and other services, 2 PIN Personal Identification Number code for restricting the use of the terminal, 3 personal ID providing a single number regardless of the location of the terminal, 4 security key and secret authentication algorithm for fraud protection, 5 language preference for LCD screen messages, 6 call barring capabilities for restricted dialling, and 7 short text messages for twoway communications. SIM cards gives the user convenience and mobility. When a SIM card is used, the terminal senses the number and automatically bills call charges to a predetermined account. The Handset of the Portable Terminal Except for the insertion of the SIM card, the operation of the InmarsatM terminal is performed from the handset. Despite its small size, numerous functions are built in to this intelligent handset. The main functions are listed next  Storing Telephone Numbers  Users can store names and numbers in the handset and access them as an electronic directory. Numbers stored on the SIM card can also be accessed.  Battery Status Indication  A fourstage icon on the LCD indicates the battery status. An alarm and LCD messages alert the user to low battery condition before the end of talk time.  CallinAbsence Indication  Unanswered calls are indicated by an LCD icon. The last 10 calls are displayed with caller ID and times and dates if the calls were made via ISDN.   Report on Question 162 83  Credit Card Calling  Users can make credit card calls by keying in a twodigit prefix and the credit card number.  Call Duration Display  Call duration is displayed at the end of every call. The handset also displays the duration of the previous call.  Signal Strength Indicator visual and aural  Signal strength levels are displayed on the LCD. If the Menu button is pressed, the current signal strength is shown. Users can also set the terminal to emit beeping tones to indicate the signal strength.  Barred Calls  The user can set the terminal to prevent calls to specified numbers or countries.  Other Functions  Power save mode, backlight, redialling, users numbersocean region display, phone lock, speed dialling, mute.                  84  Report on Question 162 ANNEX  2C  The globalstar system General The following information is extracted from material provided by courtesy of Globalstar L.P. The Globalstar system consists of a Space Segment, a User Segment, a Ground segment, and a Terrestrial Network as shown in Figure 1. The Globalstar system provides communications from any point on the earth surface to any other point on the earth surface, exclusive of the polar regions. The satellite orbits are optimized to provide highest link availability in the area between 70 degrees south latitude and 70 degrees north latitude. Service is feasible in higher latitudes with decreased link availability. User Terminals can be served by a satellite 10 to 15 minutes out of each orbit. A smooth transfer process between beams within a satellite and between satellites provides unbroken communications for the users. The orbital planes are inclined at 52 degrees. Coverage is maximized in the temperate areas with at least two satellites in view, providing path diversity over most of the area. There is some small sacrifice in multiple satellite coverage at the equator and at latitudes above 60 degrees. The Gateways to the terrestrial network are illuminated by an earth coverage beam. The Gateway connects the User Terminal to the terrestrial network via an earth terminal. The terrestrial network is not a part of Globalstar. Globalstar can locate the position of a User Terminal and provide the location as a service. Accuracy of the position location service is a function of several variables including a Number of Satellites in View, b Position Accuracy of the Satellites, c Geometry of the User Terminals, Satellites and Gateways, d The length of time that the User Terminal is connected to the Gateway. The Gateway will also support more precise User Terminal position location as a service. With clear line of sight to at least two satellites, separated by at least 22 degrees as seen by the User Terminal, the Gateway will be able to compute the User Terminals position to within 300 meters with 95 probability in less than 10 seconds. Space segment and orbit constellation The Globalstar space segment consists of 48 satellites in 1410 km Low Earth Orbits. The low orbits permit low power handsets similar to cellular phones. These satellites are distributed in 8 orbital planes with 6 equally spaced satellites per orbital plane. Satellites complete an orbit every 114 minutes. User Terminals in a particular location on the surface of the earth are illuminated by a 16 beam satellite antenna as it passes over the earth. The Globalstar satellite is a simple low cost satellite designed to minimize both satellite costs and launch costs. A User Terminal transmits to the satellite by LBand. The signal enters the satellite through the LBand low noise amplifier. It is amplified and then converted into a CBand signal after which it is further amplified. This is radiated to the Gateway. The Gateway receives the signal and block downconverts to an intermediate frequency. A sample of the intermediate frequency is provided to the TCU for processing. The communications traffic is presented to the CDMA equipment for demodulation. In the transmit direction, the Gateway combines the uplink CDMA signals with the signal from the command transmitter and radiates it at CBand up to the satellite. The satellite then down converts the signal and radiates an SBand downlink signal to the User Terminals. Table 1 shows typical link budgets for all frequencies used by the Globalstar system.    Report on Question 162 85  Figure 1    Overview of the Globalstar Leo System      Telemetry and commanding shares the CBand with the communications feeder links. The TC connects to the normal CBand communications antenna for onorbit operations. There is also a TC antenna on the antiearth face of the satellite. This antenna functions when the satellite is not oriented correctly or when there are problems. The antiearth antenna is to insure that telemetry can be obtained and commands entered under all recoverable contingencies. Note that the antiearth antenna bypasses the Low Noise Amplifier. This means that the transmitted power from the commanding earth terminal will have to be higher than the normal power required for commanding. This can be accommodated because there is no communications traffic when the satellite is not oriented correctly. The satellite is steered in yaw to keep the solar panels oriented toward the sun to extract the maximum energy. This increases the communications capacity of the Globalstar System. There are some minor penalties that cause a slightly slower acquisition time and may cause more hand offs than would be otherwise required. 86  Report on Question 162  Table 1    Typical link budgets for all frequency bands    Frequency plan The frequency plan adopted by Globalstar is illustrated in Figure 2.

Report on Question 162 87 Ground segment Gateways The Gateway interconnects the Globalstar satellite based wireless network and the PLMN, such as AMPS and GSM, or directly into the local telephone office PSTN. As such, it is a termination point for network transmission and network signaling. The Gateway can be connected to existing PSTN using standard ElT1 trunk supporting a variety of signaling protocols. To GSM networks, the Gateway appears as a GSM Base Station Subsystem. To those mobile switches in the EIATIA environment, it appears as another mobile switch supporting the IS41 Intersystem Operation Standard. In all cases, interoperability between Globalstar and telephonecellular companies is assured and the subscriber maintains a convenient single point for billing. The Gateway is designed in a modular manner to provide flexibility in order to grow in step with market demand. The Globalstar Gateway can be shared by multiple service providers who can share investment in startup common equipment. This design provides security from other service providers sharing the gateway and expansion is planned as revenues rise. Each gateway will contain up to four tracking antennas and radio frequency front ends that track the satellites orbiting in their view. Gateways are expected to cost from 2 million to 5 million, depending upon the number of subscribers being serviced by the gateway and assuming that the gateway will be located at the site of an existing cellular or other appropriate telecommunications switch. Each nation with at least one gateway within it borders will have complete control over system access by users within its territory. A single gateway is expected to be able to provide fixed coverage over an area larger than Saudi Arabia and mobile coverage over an area almost as large as Western Europe. Thus, full global landbased coverage of virtually all inhabited areas of the globe could theoretically be achieved with as few as 100 gateways. Globalstar believes, however, that as many as 210 gateways may be required to minimize landbased longdistance charges and to respect national boundaries. Although Globalstar has commissioned the design of the gateways to be used with the Globalstar system, ownership and operation of the gateways will be the responsibility of service providers in each country or region in which Globalstar operations are authorized. Satellite Control Globalstars SOCCs will track and control the satellite constellation using command and telemetry units located in various gateways around the world and telemetry stations in two locations in the United States. The SOCCs will control satellite orbit positioning, maneuvers and station keeping, and will monitor satellite health and status in all subsystems. Furthermore, Globalstar has entered into a contract with QUALCOMM Inc., providing for the design, development, manufacture, installation, testing and maintenance of two ground operations control centres GOCCs. The GOCCs, which will be in continuous operation 24 hours a day, will be responsible for planning and controlling satellite utilization by gateway terminals and coordinating information received from the SOCCs. In addition to these planning functions, the GOCCs will be responsible for monitoring system performance, collecting information for billings to service providers and ensuring that the gateways do not exceed allocated system capacity. The GOCCs will be responsible for dynamically allocating system capacity among nearby regions to optimally service changing patterns of demand. User Terminal  Dualmode User Terminal The GlobalstarGSM Dualmode User Terminal offers a global roaming solution for GSM cellular phone users. Globalstar enhances wireless service options by providing worldwide GSM cellularlike services in areas outside traditional cellular coverage. Inside the GSM service area, a Globalstar subscriber can continue to use the GSM services. Outside the GSM service area subscriber may roam to other GSM 88  Report on Question 162 cellular networks or switch to the Globalstar network. Even in areas not served by cellular companies, subscribers are ensured of reliable, cost effective, world class mobile communication by Globalstar. The Globalstar constellation of Low Earth Orbit satellites will provide digitally crisp voice, data, and facsimile services. In all cases, interoperability between Globalstar and GSM is assured and subscribers maintain a convenient single point for billing. For the mobile subscribers, a vehicle mount car kit is available. The Globalstar handheld unit can be mounted in a cradle that provides power to extend battery life and allows for handsfree operation for convenience and driving safety.

Even in the areas not served by cellular services, the subscriber is insured access to reliable, cost effective, world class mobile communication available from Globalstar. The Globalstar system of low Earth orbit satellites will continue to provide digitally crisp voice, data, and facsimile services using handheld, vehicle mounted or fixed products. In all cases, interoperability between Globalstar and cellular companies is assured and the subscriber maintains a convenient single point for billing. For mobile subscribers, a vehicle mounted car kit is available. The Globalstar handheld unit can be mounted in a cradle that provides power to extend battery life and a handsfree operation for convenience and driving safety.   Report on Question 162 89 Fixed Single Line Globalstars family of fixed products meet the immediate communication demands for voice, facsimile and computer transmissions, and provides the flexibility, capacity and quality needed for future growth in demand. Wireless access offers an innovative solution for quick and efficient installation of a communications link for hard to reach subscribers without the cost and time necessary to interconnect using traditional wire. Globalstar delivers a worldwide contiguous wireless solution for delivering the last mile of connectivity with the telephone network. Globalstar has designed their fixed station products to allow local content and subscriber flexibility. A Globalstar antenna, Radio Unit and optional digital telephone is provided by Globalstar. This digital phone includes a display for call progress indicators, icons for voice mail and memory for those frequently call numbers. The subscriber equipment can be locally provided by the incountry service provider. The antenna is mounted at a convenient outdoor location with a clear view of the sky and connected to the subscriber equipment. Globalstar provides cost effective interconnection to the telephone office for the unserved hard to reach population in developed and under developed urban and rural areas. Multiline Unit Globalstar delivers a worldwide contiguous wireless solution for delivering the last mile of connectivity with the telephone network. Our family of fixed products give local operators the flexibility, capacity and quality needed for future growth. Wireless access offers an innovative solution for quick and efficient installation of a communications link for hard to reach subscribers without the cost and time necessary to interconnect using traditional wire. The Globalstar Multiline unit emulates a standard trunk circuit for interconnection with switching concentrators such as a PABX. Subscribers can be connected to the PABX using traditional wire, wireless or fiber and communicate with each other within the PABX. Globalstar is accessed when communication is required outside the switching system. The PABX subscriber will dial the outside line access number and Globalstar will connect the calling party to the public telephone office or other remote switching centre.               90  Report on Question 162 ANNEX  2D  The ICO system The following information is based on information provided by ICO General ICO is a satellitebased mobile communications system designed primarily to provide services to pocket phones. The system will offer digital voice, data, facsimile, and a suite of messaging services anywhere in the intended environments worldwide. Figure 1 is a diagram of the overall ICO system configuration. The system design integrates mobile satellite communications capability with the public land mobile networks PLMNs and employs, among others, handheld mobile telephones handhelds which offer services similar to normal cellular phones, in outdoor environments. It will route calls from PLMNs and public switched telephone networks PSTNs through ground stations called Satellite Access Nodes or ANs which will select a satellite through which the call will be connected. Calls from a mobile terminal will be routed via the satellite constellation to the appropriate fixed or mobile networks or to another mobile satellite terminal. Handsets will be produced by major manufacturers of telecommunications equipment, benefiting from terrestrial cellularPCS technology. Singlemode satelliteonly versions will be available, but most are expected to be capable of dualmode operation with both satellite and terrestrial cellularPCS systems. Dualmode handsets will be able to select either satellite or terrestrial modes of operation automatically or under user control, subject to the availability of the satellite and terrestrial systems and the users preferred service arrangements. A feature of the ICO system will be a suite of higherpenetration messaging functions capable of delivering an alert or short message. Extensive measurements of the radio wave propagation typical of that expected to be experienced by handheld users operating to satellites, including the effects of shadowing and unwanted reflections, were made in a range of representative rural, suburban, and urban environments. The results were combined with the moving geometry of the satellite constellation to assess the service availability, expressed as the probability of a handheld user being able to initiate or receive a call at any given time. An average service availability of more than 90 per cent can be provided in rural and suburban outdoor environents by providing a link power margin of about 7dB and using path diversity. In these same environents, without path diversity, a link margin of about 16 dB would be needed to achieve comparable availability. These results confirm the benefits of path diversity as a system design philosophy in terms of limiting the transmitted power and receiver sensitivity needed by individual satellites in the constellation, and thus reducing their complexity. Space Segment and Orbit Constellation A constellation of 10 satellites in medium earth orbit MEO, 10,355 km above the earths surface will be arranged in two planes of five satellites each, with one spare satellite in each plane i.e. 12 in orbit. Each orbital plane is inclined 45 degrees to the equator. 12 Satellite Access Nodes are located globally. Hughes Space  Communications International, Inc., will build the satellites under a contract signed in July 1995.  The configuration has been designed to provide coverage of the entire surface of the earth at all times and to maximise the path diversity of the system. Path diversity is the availability to a user of more than one satellite at the same time, and provides an alternative path for transmission in case one satellite is obstructed, increasing the likelihood of uninterrupted calls.    Report on Question 162 91  Figure 1    Overview of ICO system configuration       Satellite Constellation The orbital pattern is also designed for significant coverage overlap, ensuring that usually two but sometimes three and up to four satellites will be in view of a user and a SAN at any time. Each satellite will cover approximately 30 per cent of the earths surface at a given time. The satellite orbits have been selected to provide coverage of the entire globe on a continuous basis, while allowing high elevation angles to users, averaging 4050 degrees. Figure 2 shows the ICO orbit constellation. Satellite Design The satellites use the proven and popular HS601 geostationary satellite design, with attitude and control systems modified to suit the special requirements of the MEO orbit. The communications payload is of transparent design, allowing flexibility to transmission format, using a high degree of digital technology for functions such as channelisation and beam generation that have traditionally been performed by analogue technology. The digital technology provides a very flexible satellite configuration for example, flexible allocation of capacity across the full 30 MHz available in the 2 GHz service link bands, while having significant advantages over analogue technology in terms of production and manufacture for the comparatively large production run as compared with more conventional geostationary satellite orders. ICO 92  Report on Question 162  Figure 2    ICO orbit constellation      Links between individual users and satellites will be established via service antennas mounted on each of the satellites. To provide robust radio links with handheld units, the satellites use antennas with an aperture in excess of two metres. The use of multiple service link beams on each satellite also allows frequency reuse and increases the efficient use of spectrum allocation. The SANs are the primary interface with the satellite for coordinating and routing traffic. The SANs implement call routing to ensure the best quality of service to system users. In this regard, each SAN tracks the satellites within its line of sight and routes communications traffic to the optimal satellite. Each satellite is designed to support at least 4,500 telephone channels distributed among approximately 750 carrier waves by using time division multiple access TDMA technology to integrate the multiple channels into each carrier wave. TDMA technology was selected after careful consideration of other technologies, including CDMA. Internal and industry studies for the ICO system have judged TDMA to have larger traffichandling capacity and less demanding technical requirements than CDMA, and to be less subject to call failure as a result of interference. The design capacity of the individual satellites is such that this constellation will support at least 2,400 million voice minutes per year, assuming typical traffic distribution patterns with traffic hotspots. In addition, excess capacity will be available outside traffic hotspots for further traffic opportunities. The life span of ICO satellites is expected to be approximately twelve years.   Report on Question 162 93 Satellite Technology Service link and number of beams The system performance will be well in excess of that required to provide the desired level of service. The 163 transmit and receive service link beams will provide links with a power margin in excess of 8 dB the average link margin will approach 10 dB rising to 1011 dB for a user at subsatellite point. Feeder link antennas Feeder link antennas support the link between the satellites and the SANs. At any time, each satellite will usually be in direct contact with between two and four SANs. Before a satellite falls outside the line of sight of one SAN, it will establish contact with another SAN. This SAN will then track the satellite whilst it is in its line of sight and it will direct calls to this satellite or any other satellite within its sight depending on which one offers the best signal quality. Satellite mass and power estimates The total satellite launch mass, for a direct injection into the circular orbit, is about 2600 kg allowing multiple launch vehicle capability. Direct injection allows some simplification to the HS601 as no apogee motor is to achieve final orbit. The solar arrays will use the latest Gallium Arsenide cells to provide end of life powers in excess of 8,700 W. Selection of Orbital Configuration Prior to selecting the MEO orbital configuration, Inmarsat, the largest shareholder and sponsor of ICO, conducted an extensive analysis and review of a broad range of the then available technical options. These studies focused on service properties, cost, technical risks and market potential. The research was conducted by Inmarsat with Inmarsat Signatory participation, and through a number of commissioned studies by main aerospace and telecommunications industry contractors. The Inmarsat studies considered the relative merits of the generally known technically feasible options of providing a communication service to handheld satellite phones from i Low earth orbit LEO  up to 2,000 km altitude ii Medium earth orbit MEO  8,000 to 20,000 km or  iii Geostationary orbit GEO To cover the earth fully, LEO requires around 4070 satellites, MEO needs 620 satellites, and GEO needs 36 satellites. Inmarsat concluded that the MEO configuration could offer best overall service quality for the desired market. This is because of the orbital properties, which confer, with a reasonable number of satellites, the following benefits i High average elevation angle from user to satellites, minimising probability of blockage ii High probability of a user being in the field of view of more than one satellite hence offering good satellite path diversity iii Slowmoving satellites about 1 degree per minute across the sky as perceived by the user The technology studies of the LEO, MEO, and GEO satellite constellations concluded that MEO represents a reasonable implementation and schedule compromise. The large number of LEO satellites which would be needed, taken with their relatively short lifetimes in their expected radiation environment, present logistical and manufacturing problems in maintaining the constellation.  Constellation Service Performance Features There are tradeoffs related to each of the orbital configurations with respect to service characteristics, costs, complexities and risks. Connectivity and propagation delay are most likely to be noticed by users. Connectivity  All orbital configurations normally require a user to have a line of sight to a satellite to initiate and retain a connection. Obstructions such as buildings and mountains between a user and a satellite may prevent the establishment of a link or may sever an existing link, and both natural and urban canyons may present difficulties.  94  Report on Question 162 MEO or LEO systems typically allow for overlapping coverage of the earth from multiple satellites, which increases the likelihood of at least one satellite being within view of the user in order to establish a link. As the satellites in these systems move relative to the earth, they also leave the users or the SANs line of sight, moving either beyond the horizon or possibly behind an obstruction. To maintain a link, MEO and LEO systems must incorporate a system of handoffs. MEO satellites move across the users field of view more slowly than LEO satellites because they orbit at a higher altitude, which reduces the frequency of handoffs required. Propagation delay  This is the time delay, proportional to the sum of the distances between the satellite and the user and between the satellite and the SAN, resulting from the distance the radio signal travels. GEO systems have the highest propagation delay, while LEO systems encounter the least. A propagation delay of less than 200 milliseconds is characteristic of MEO and is well within acceptable limits. Frequency plan Service link spectrum requirements for connection between user terminals and satellites  The choice of bands for the provision of service links for MSS systems include 1.61.5 GHz, 1.62.4 GHz and around 2 GHz. ICO has chosen to operate in the 2 GHz bands, between 19852015 MHz and 21702200 MHz. For the planned traffic distributions and volume, the service link spectrum requirement will be around 10 MHz in each of the uplink and downlink directions. The ICO satellites will retain the flexibility to maximise the use of the spectrum available in each direction in the 19852015 MHz and 21702200 MHz bands. Feeder link spectrum requirements for connection between satellites and SAN  For feeder link operation, ICO has chosen to operate in the bands 51505250 MHz and 69757075 MHz. These bands form part of a pair of new allocations made by WRC95 for feeder links to nongeostationary satellites providing MSS. Ground segment The satellites will be linked to a ground network the ICONET which will interconnect twelve SANs optimally located throughout the world. SANs comprise earth stations with multiple antennas for communicating with satellites, and associated switching equipment and databases. The ICONET and SANs will implement the selection of call routings to ensure the highest possible quality and availability of service to system users. Figure 3 shows a block diagram of the ICONET. Gateways will be located throughout the world and will connect into the ICONET to serve as the interface with the PSTN and PLMNs. They will be owned by third party operators who will be authorised to access the ICO system. ICONET and satellite access nodes SANs will be the primary interface between the satellites and the Gateways. They will also house the equipment which will route the satellite signals for distribution to the appropriate Gateways. A SAN will comprise three main elements i Five antennas, with associated equipment to communicate with the satellites ii A switch to route traffic within the ICONET and to Gateways and iii Databases to support mobility management. Each SAN will contain a database to hold details of user terminals currently registered to that SAN in GSM terminology, this is a Visitor Location Register or VLR. At least one SAN will also contain a database for holding some information on users Home Location Register or HLR, though this function may be distributed among more than one SAN or in the PLMN.   Report on Question 162 95  Figure 3    The ICONEt      Each SAN will track the satellites within its sight, direct communications traffic to the optimal satellite for the most robust link, and subsequently, as appropriate, will execute handoffs from the satellite with the less robust link to the optimal satellite then in the line of sight of the SAN so as to maintain uninterrupted communication. ICO will procure twelve SANs, strategically located around the world approximately two per continent and will own these facilities and commission their design and procurement, but the installation and operation of the SANs will be contracted out. The network of SANs will be interconnected by a terrestrial backbone network called the ICONET, which will allow calls to be routed through the ground segment of the network to the SAN best able to service the call. The ICONET will be managed by the Network Control Centre. Gateways Gateways are switches which will serve as the link between the SANs and the public terrestrial networks. Each Gateway will be connected to the ICONET, which will allow flexibility in traffic allocation and backup traffic routing. The switch may be either a selfcontained, dedicated unit or may be implemented as an additional function on an existing switch. Gateways will be owned and operated by third parties. There is no predefined technical limit to the number of Gateways which can be incorporated into the system, and their location will be determined by market proximity and access to existing PSTN, PSDN, or PLMN switches. 96  Report on Question 162 User Mobility Management In order to provide global roaming, the ICONET will include a system for management of global user mobility based upon the existing digital cellular standard, GSM. HLRs in coordination with VLRs will verify user information and status, and locate the user anywhere in the world. Any handset which is turned on will send a signal via satellite and SAN to the users HLR which will verify the users status and allow access to the system. The system will communicate this clearance to that SAN and register it in its VLR. The HLRs second function is to communicate the VLR location of any user to the SAN through which an incoming call is originated. This will enable the call to be directed to the SAN closest to the intended call recipient. The call will then be completed via satellite link. Cellular Network Integration A critical feature of ICO will be its integration into PLMNs existing at that time. In most instances the satellite network will be viewed as a complementary service to PLMN subscribers who wish to have the capability of making and receiving calls in areas not serviced by their PLMNs. The ICO network architecture will allow two broad groupings of users to be made, with corresponding service distinctions local or regional users and users who operate worldwide. ICO Global Communications is studying several alternative approaches to integration, including the system requirements for global numbering and the logistics of locating users and call linkage within and outside the range of cellular networks. ICO will include a dualmode handset which will access both satellite and PLMN networks from the same terminal. Telemetry, Tracking and Control  TTC TTC stations will manage the ICO satellite system by tracking the movements of the satellites and adjusting their orbits to maintain the constellation. TTC stations will also monitor the general condition of the satellites by collecting data on the power supply, temperature, stability and other operating characteristics of the satellites and relaying that data to the stations for processing and response. Satellite Network Control The NCSs, acting through TTC stations and SANs, will control the transponder linkages between the feeder and service antennas on the satellites. This process will dictate, among other things, frequency reconfiguration within feeder link beams and optimal channel allocation between high and low traffic spot beams. User terminals Pocket Phones The large majority of ICO user terminals are expected to be handheld, pocketsized telephones, capable of dualmode satellite and cellular or PCS operation and very similar in size and appearance and in voice quality to todays pocket cellularPCS phones. The price of ICO dual mode phones, on the basis of high volume production, is expected to be competitive with other comparable satellite systems at service introduction. The ICO pocket phone is planned to have optional features including external data ports and internal buffer memory to support data communication, messaging functions, facsimile, and the use of smartcards SIMs.   Report on Question 162 97 Safety The ICO system has been designed to ensure that the pocket phone will comply with expected safety requirements in respect of radio frequency radiation. The average transmitted power typically during use will not exceed 0.25 watts. Existing cellular phones have average transmitted power typically in the range of 0.25 to 0.6 watts. Other Derived User Terminal Types The technology used in ICO pocket phones is expected also to be incorporated in a wide range of other user terminal types including vehicular, aeronautical, and maritime mobile terminals and semifixed and fixed terminals, such as rural phone booths and community telephones. For many of these terminals it will be possible to use highergain antennas andor higher transmit powers than are used for the pocket phones, which will permit higher bitrate services to be supported.                      98  Report on Question 162 ANNEX  2E  The skybridge global multimedia access The following information is based on information provided by Skybridge Introduction Over the past few years, businesses and individuals have rapidly embraced the Internet, realizing the benefits not only of being able to access information from all over the world at low cost, but also the potential of electronic commerce. However, the powerful interactive multimedia services that characterize the new information age required ever larger circuit capacities to transport text, images, video, sound and data. Indeed, many of these services require transmission rates tens to thousands of times larger than those needed for a simple phone call. It is estimated that by the year 2005, more than 400 million users worldwide will be using such broadband services.                       To meet this demand, telecom operators have invested heavily in fiberoptic backbone networks which can transport multimedia information around the globe at the speed of light. However, the local networks that bring these services to end users have lagged far behind, creating bottlenecks which will be familiar   Report on Question 162 99 to everyone who has waited and waited for an Internet page to download. The main reason is, of course, the high cost of replacing or upgrading the local access infrastructure, which represents more than 70 of total network investment. It is both financially and physically impossible to replace the installed local loop by high speed fiber within a few years. Technologies such as Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line ADSL and cable modems are providing attractive solutions that use the existing copper telephone networks and cable networks. However, such technologies cannot be made available technically or at a sufficiently low cost in a number of situations e.g. in low density areas, where existing networks are of insufficient quality. Many users will thus continue to suffer from traffic jams. As a result, operators are losing the considerable revenue which they might expect to earn from offering broadband services to all their subscribers. The question then is, how can we solve this problem in an affordable way The answer is SkyBridge, a satellite access system which overcomes the local loop limitations by providing high speed access to the worlds fiber optic backbone networks. Scheduled to start operation in 2003, SkyBridge will enable telecom operators to offer local broadband access to over 20 million users worldwide, using a constellation of 80 Low Earth Orbit LEO satellites. It will be the first broadband LEO satellite system, and the only one focused entirely on local access. By interconnecting the SkyBridge satellite access network with fiber optic backbones, SkyBridge will make global high speed endtoend connectivity a reality at an affordable price. Operators will benefit from low cost, flexibility, rapid deployment and a high quality of service. As SkyBridge provides bandwidth on demand, they can allocate capacity wherever and whenever necessary to meet users needs. Users gain the advantage of costeffective access to multimedia services using a small, inexpensive antenna. Because it uses satellite technology, SkyBridge is not constrained by the terrain or the existing local infrastructure. Thus it enables people and businesses in rural and remote areas, and in developing countries, to take advantage of the information age, helping to boost the local economy. SkyBridge System SkyBridge uses a constellation of 80 satellites orbiting the earth at an altitude of 1469 km. Because the system operates in the Kuband 10 to 18 GHz, it is able to provide high availability based on the use of proven satellite technology. In addition, the Kuband is much more robust against rain attenuation than higher frequency bands, and therefore offers a high quality service even in poor weather conditions. The use of this band, which SkyBridge shares with a number of geostationary satellite systems and terrestrial microwave systems, has been unanimously approved by the World Radiocommunications Conference WRC of the International Telecommunications Union ITU.  Traffic is routed from the users antenna via the LEO satellites to a terrestrial gateway which interfaces with the terrestrial infrastructure. Switching and routing can be performed either in the gateway or by a remote switch in the operators network. Flexibility and the ability to evolve gracefully are built into SkyBridge as it operates on the simple bent pipe principle with no onboard switching or satellitetosatellite communication links. Consequently, operators can manage the capacity of their networks as necessary, and develop services to meet emerging user demands. This flexibility will be crucial in maintaining a competitive market position well into the next millennium. Architecture The system architecture is divided into a space segment and a telecommunication segment. The space segment comprises  A constellation of 80 LEO satellites, plus spares.  Two Satellite Control Centres SCC.  Tracking, Telemetry and Command TTC ground stations.  Two Mission Control Centres. 100  Report on Question 162 The satellites orbit in a socalled Walker constellation, which consists of 20 planes, equally inclined by 53 relative to the equator. There are four satellites in each plane, orbiting at an altitude of 1469 km.          A key design feature of the satellites is the use of active antennas which generate the spot beams and maintain them pointing towards the corresponding terrestrial gateways. Each spot beam illuminates a 700 km diameter cell. It can serve user terminals with an elevation angle of more than 10. The above figure shows the telecommunication segment. This consists of user terminals and gateways, which interface with local servers, narrow or broadbandterrestrial networks, or leased lines. User terminals comprise the antenna equipment and an interface for connection to the users equipment, such as a multimedia PC. Up to 200 gateways are planned, ensuring global coverage. In regions with low population densities, one gateway can serve several cells. Residential users equipped with small, 50 cm roofmounted antennas can receive at up to 20 Mbits forward link and transmit at up to 2 Mbits return link. Business terminals using 80 to 100 cm antennas can receive and transmit 3 to 5 times higher bitrates. SkyBridge uses standard Asynchronous Transfer Mode ATM and Internet ProtocolTransmission Control Protocol IPTCP so that it can work seamlessly with the established and future terrestrial networks.   Report on Question 162 101 Handover As a satellite moves out of sight of a terminal, the traffic it is handling with that terminal is handed over to another satellite to ensure continuity of service the first satellite then refocuses on other terminals. Handover for a cell is managed by the corresponding gateway.  Figure 1    Telecommunication segment of the SkyBridge system      Links with the outgoing satellite are maintained long enough for the terminal and gateway antennas to point to and synchronize with the incoming satellite. Calls are switched over as soon as synchronization has been achieved. SkyBridge Services Because of the constraint of data acknowledgement, the performance throughput, window size of IP packet transport is mainly influenced by the satellite round trip delay. The low signal transmission delay of the SkyBridge constellation 30 ms compared to 500 ms for Geostationary satellites guarantees a good transfer efficiency for the support of Internet access services. In addition, SkyBridge is designed to be compatible with current and emerging Internet protocol standards e.g. Resource Reservation ProtocolDifferentiated Services, Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet which are currently being defined to support realtime quality of service over the Internet or other packetbased broadband networks. 102  Report on Question 162 Enduser services The SkyBridge System supports a wide range of services   Multimedia Applications Over the Internet meet the increasing demand for realtime media e.g. live video press conferences, live Internet radio, as well as emerging telephony and video conferencing on the Internet.  Direct access to online services and content SkyBridge System traffic can be routed directly to a local server that provides local services and content.  LAN interconnection and private networking these are provided by interconnecting individual terminals and Local Area Networks LANs via satellite links. In addition, the System enables operators to provide virtual LAN services by facilitating remote access to LANs for telecommuters at home or employees in the field, and Wide Area Network WAN.  Connection to the Public Narrowband Network enables any end user to use his or her own standard or digital telephone set, as well as other types of End User Terminals, such as screen phones or settop boxes.  Videotelephony and Video Conferencing enable multiple users at two or more sites to communicate in realtime with bidirectional or multidirectional exchange of audio, video, and other data including corporate applications and documents.  Electronic Commerce includes the marketing, ordering, delivery and payment for goods and services online. Ecommerce is expected to be a major driver force behind the demand for broadband services over the Internet, intranets and extranets.  Telecommuting makes it possible for people to work away from traditional offices through remote LANWAN connections. The SkyBridge System also gives telecommuters access to remote LAN connections.  Telelearning supports virtual classroom in which instructors and students are in different locations served by SkyBridge.  Telemedicine involves a combination of videoondemand, multimedia information retrieval and video conferencing. Narrowband and Broadband transport services SkyBridge supports narrowband services both for the provision of telephony services in suburban areas and sparsely populated areas, and for the rapid deployment of public infrastructures and private networks. In addition SkyBridges transport capability supports connection to complementary broadband access systems such as ADSL, and the interconnection of remote groups of users to the SkyBridge Gateways.  SkyBridge endusers The SkyBridge system serves two categories of users  professional users accessing remote databases and sharing interactive applications with other parties outside their business Customer Premises Network.  residential users requiring entertainment, video communication, access to Internet Service Providers, etc. Professional users Professional users may require point to point or point to multipoint connectivity for applications such as teleconferencing, cooperative work, LANtoLAN interconnection. Via SkyBridge, a professional user can contact another professional user connected to an external corporate network e.g. WAN, Intranet, Virtual Private Network VPN, or any other user equipped with a SkyBridge terminal.    Report on Question 162 103 Residential users Communications can be set up between different local SkyBridge residential users within the SkyBridge coverage area as well as between any residential user and the Service Providers connected to SkyBridge gateways. Operators  In certain cases, network operators can also be considered as end users. In particular, SkyBridge can transmit switched or transparent E1 and T1 links. Frequency Reuse Concept One of the most important aspects of efficient frequency management is the concept of sharing between different telecom services and systems. Wellstructured sharing techniques, enable new technologies to be deployed, which allow exciting new services to come online without disturbing existing services. SkyBridge is an example of this spirit of sharing. Innovative design enables SkyBridge to greatly extend access to advanced telecommunications by reusing frequencies already used by other systems, including geostationary satellite and fixed service systems. SkyBridge is playing a pivotal role in creating the environment, that will allow this tradition of sharing and efficient frequency use to continue for NonGeostationary Satellite Orbit Fixed Satellite Service NGSO FSS systems. The 1997 World Radiocommunication Conference WRC97 took a strategic first step in approving the concept of Power Flux Density PFD limits. These specify the technical parameters with which a constellation of NGSO satellites must comply to ensure adequate protection to geostationary satellites and terrestrial services. WRC97 also created a technical forum in which engineers from around the world are meeting to determine at the precise levels of protection to be afforded to Geostationary Satellite Orbit GSO systems and terrestrial services, while allowing the introduction of NGSO FSS services. This cooperative effort is well underway and has made substantial progress towards its goal. It will be up to WRC2000 to finalize this regime and adopt the work done by the ITUR working group examining this subject. Because SkyBridge shares the Kuband 10 to 18 GHz with existing geostationary broadcasting satellite systems, terrestrial networks, space science projects and radiolocation services, one of the main design challenges was to ensure that it will not cause harmful interference to these or any future systems using the same band.  To achieve this, SkyBridge has optimized the various system radio parameters. First, the frequency plan has been carefully selected, including the allocation of some bands exclusively to gateway stations with no user terminals. Second, the satellite antennas have been designed to provide optimum performance. And third, the waveform has been carefully designed to minimize the required power and to ensure that the system is robust to interference from other users of the Kuband. Protecting Geostationary Satellite Systems Existing geostationary satellite systems operate within a well established operating environment. Frequency sharing with geostationary satellite systems using the same Kuband is based firstly on giving adequate protection against three potential forms of interference  Interference between the main beam of a SkyBridge transmitter and the main beam of a geostationary satellite receiver.  Interference between the main beam of a SkyBridge transmitter and the sidelobe of a geostationary satellite receiver.  Interference between the sidelobe of a SkyBridge transmitter and the sidelobe of a geostationary satellite receiver. 104  Report on Question 162  Figure 2    Frequency plan and sharing issues          By exploiting the directivity of the SkyBridge and geostationary satellite earth stations, SkyBridge protects existing satellite systems against these forms of interference in a way that is transparent to endusers. All GSO earth stations point toward the GSO arc, offering the rest of the space an important antenna angular discrimination. In particular, to avoid interfering with the receivers of geostationary systems, SkyBridge satellites cease transmission to a given cell when an earth station recognizes that they are close to a GSO pointing direction. Each gateway has a defined nonoperating zone which includes all the satellite positions that would potentially create interference with a geostationary satellite and associated earth stations. As soon as a SkyBridge satellite enters this zone, it ceases transmission to the gateway cell corresponding to the exclusion zone at the same time, the gateway and all the user terminals in that cell stop transmitting to the satellite. Traffic in the cell is transparently handed over to other satellites in the constellation to ensure continuity of service. Based on an extensive analysis of the interference environment, the nonoperating zone has been defined as a belt of 10 on either side of the geostationary arc, as seen by any earth station in a gateway cell. Consequently, the nonoperating zone is wider than 10 for most points within the zone, ensuring even better protection. This limits the residual mainbeamtosidelobe and sidelobetomainbeam power. Protecting Terrestrial Services The primary measure taken by SkyBridge to help protect the fixed terrestrial service against interference was to carefully select the frequency bands used by the small user terminals when receiving and transmitting. Only gateways operate in frequency bands that are regularly used by the fixed service. Coordination between the two systems is eased as a result of the better discrimination provided by the large gateway antennas and the limited number of earth stations to be coordinated. While this constrains the SkyBridge system, it simplifies the protection of fixed service links operating in the Kuband.

General agreement has been reached on these procedures. Fixed Service reception also needs to be protected from NGSO satellite emissions through the definition of adequate PFD limits. General agreement has also been reached on these limits. Protection of Radiolocation Service and Space Science Existing radio regulations stipulate a maximum Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power EIRP emitted by earth stations in order to protect Space Science systems which are planned to operate in the Kuband. They also specify the minimum EIRP at which earth stations must operate in order to be protected from the radiolocation service. SkyBridge has undertaken a detailed technical analysis to determine how it will affect these services. As a result of its use of an interference robust waveform SkyBridge has proven that it can operate in the Kuband alongside radiolocation services. In addition, SkyBridge is proposing to limit the power transmitted by its gateways below the level defined in current radio regulations, thereby ensuring that space science applications are protected against interference from NGSO earth stations.                 106  Report on Question 162 ANNEX  2F  The teledesic system The following information is based on information provided by Teledesic Through a broad, cooperative effort, Teledesic will bring affordable access to fiberlike telecommunications services to all parts of the world that would not be economical to serve through terrestrial means. Today, advanced telecommunications infrastructure is limited to the developed urban areas of the world. This leaves most of the worlds population without access to even basic communications services. Even those areas with basic voice service get access through 100yearold technology  analog, copper networks  that for the overwhelming part will never be upgraded to support digital, broadband services. Teledesic is building a global, broadband InternetintheSky. Using a constellation of several hundred lowEarthorbit satellites, Teledesic will create the worlds first network to provide affordable, worldwide, fiberlike access to telecommunications services such as broadband Internet access, videoconferencing, highquality voice and other digital data needs. On Day One of service, Teledesic will enable broadband telecommunications access for businesses, schools and individuals everywhere on the planet. Teledesic has received support from the developed and developing world alike, resulting in both international and domestic satellite service designations for the frequencies necessary to accommodate the Teledesic Network. In March 1997, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission licensed Teledesic to build, launch, and operate the Teledesic Network.  The Teledesic Network Teledesic does not intend to market services directly to endusers. Rather, it will provide an open network for the delivery of such services by others. The Teledesic Network will enable service providers in host countries to extend their networks, both in terms of geographic scope and in the kinds of services they can offer. Groundbased gateways will enable service providers to offer seamless links to other wireline and wireless networks, such as the Internet. The Teledesic Network will consist of 288 operational satellites, divided into 12 planes, each with 24 satellites. To make efficient use of the radio spectrum, frequencies are allocated dynamically and reused many times within each satellite footprint. Within any circular area of 100 km radius, the Teledesic Network can support over 500 megabits per second Mbits of data to and from user terminals. The Teledesic Network supports bandwidthondemand, allowing a user to request and release capacity as needed. This enables users to pay only for the capacity they actually use, and for the Network to support a much higher number of users. Teledesic will operate in a portion of the highfrequency Kuband 28.629.1 GHz uplink and 18.819.3 GHz downlink. The Teledesic Networks low orbit eliminates the long signal delay experienced in communications through traditional geostationary satellites and enables the use of small, lowpower terminals and antennas, about the size of direct broadcast satellite DBS dishes. The Teledesic Network is designed to support millions of simultaneous users. Most users will have twoway connections that provide up to 64 Mbits on the downlink and up to 2 Mbits on the uplink. Broadband terminals will offer 64 Mbits of twoway capacity. This represents access speeds up to 2,000 times faster than todays standard analogue modems. For example, transmitting a set of xrays may take four hours over one of todays standard modems. The same images can be sent over the Teledesic Network in seven seconds. Design, production and deployment of the Teledesic Network will cost 9 billion. Enduser rates will be set by service providers, but Teledesic expects rates to be comparable to those of future urban wireline services for broadband access.   Report on Question 162 107 Seamless Compatibility with Terrestrial Networks Without knowing for certain all the applications and data protocols a broadband network will be called upon to accommodate in the 21st Century, it is reasonable to assume that those applications will be developed in the advanced urban areas of the developed world  where fiberoptics sets the standard. Satellite systems offer the capability to provide locationinsensitive, switched, broadband access, extending the reach of networks and applications to anywhere on Earth. But to ensure seamless compatibility with those networks, a satellite system should be designed with the same essential characteristics as fiber networks  broadband channels, low error rates and low delays.  Satellite systems are of two general types geostationaryEarthorbit GEO and nongeostationary, primarily lowEarthorbit LEO. Geostationary satellites orbit at an altitude of 36,000 kilometers km above the Equator  the only orbit that allows the satellite to maintain a fixed position in relation to Earth. At this height, communications through a GEO entail a minimum roundtrip transmission latency  endtoend delay  of at least onehalf second. This means that GEOs can never provide fiberlike delays. This GEO latency is the source of the annoying delay in many intercontinental phone calls, impeding understanding and distorting the personal nuances of speech. What can be an inconvenience on voice transmissions, however, can be untenable for realtime applications such as videoconferencing as well as many standard data protocols  even for the protocols underlying the Internet. One of the fundamental principles of the Internet is the notion of all applications moving on to a common network platform  an open network based on common standards and protocols. The idea of standalone, proprietary networks, or applicationspecific networks, is fast disappearing. All applications will move over the same networks, using the same protocols. In these packetswitched networks  where voice, video, and data are all just packets of digitized bits  it is not practical to separate out applications that can tolerate delay from those that cannot. As a result, the network should be designed for the most demanding application. The Teledesic Network is designed to provide endtoend QualityofService that enables global enterprise networking, meeting the demands of the Internet of the future. Distributed vs. Centralized Architecture Just as networks on the ground have evolved from centralized systems built around a single mainframe computer to distributed networks of interconnected PCs, spacebased satellite networks are evolving from centralized networks relying on a single geostationary satellite to distributed networks of interconnected lowEarthorbit satellites. In geostationary systems, any single satellite loss or failure is catastrophic to the system. To reduce this contingency to acceptable levels, reliability must be engineered far along toward the point of diminishing returns where further gains in reliability are achieved only at a very high cost. With a distributed network, like the Teledesic Network, reliability can be built into the network rather than the individual unit, reducing the complexity and cost of the individual satellites and enabling more streamlined, automated manufacturing processes and associated design enhancements. In its distributed architecture, dynamic routing, and robust scalability, the Teledesic Network emulates the most famous distributed network, the Internet, while adding the benefits of realtime capability and locationinsensitive access. LowEarthOrbit Satellite Systems The evolution from geostationary to lowEarthorbit LEO satellites has resulted in a number of proposed global satellite systems, which can be grouped into three distinct types. These LEO systems can best be distinguished by reference to their terrestrial counterparts paging, cellular, and fiber. The Big LEOs, for example, provide premiumpriced, narrowband mobile voice service, whereas Teledesic provides primarily fixed, broadband connections at costs comparable to urban wireline service. Just as cellular and fiber are generally not considered to be competitive, the only thing Teledesic really has in common with the Big LEOs is the use of lowEarthorbit satellites. 108  Report on Question 162 Elevation Angle The Teledesic Network is designed so that from anywhere on Earth, a Teledesic satellite can always be viewed nearly directly overhead. This is ensured by having an elevation angle of 40 degrees or higher at all times in all locations.  Teledesics 40 elevation angle enables users to place terminals on most offices, schools, and homes with an unobstructed view of the sky in all directions. A lower elevation angle dramatically increases the likelihood of obstruction by surrounding buildings, trees, or terrain, preventing service. In many areas, a low elevation angle can make any service impractical or simply impossible. Additionally, signals at high frequencies can also be blocked by rain, especially when sent at a lower elevation angle. Teledesics 40 elevation angle is essential to meeting the companys goals for high qualityofservice, with availability comparable to terrestrial networks. It also reduces the user terminal size and cost and improves the ease of coordinating the use of radio frequencies with other systems and services. The Market for Teledesic The convergence of computing and communications is causing all things one associates with a high standard of living  from education and health care to economic development and public services  to become dependent on an everincreasing flow of information. In highly urbanized areas, this demand for information is being satisfied by the highbandwidth and highquality connections of fiber optics. Increasingly, institutions and individuals are utilizing broadband connections for Internet access, computer networking, aggregation and trunking of voice lines, and telecommuting. But step out of the cities, and these fiberlike telecommunications services become prohibitively expensive or are simply unavailable at any price. The Teledesic Network will seamlessly extend the existing terrestrial, fiberbased infrastructure to provide advanced information services anywhere on Earth. Customers will range from the information workers unwilling to be confined in increasingly congested cities, to countries backhauling aggregated voice lines from remote cellular sites, to multinational corporations connecting branch offices throughout the world into their existing global enterprise networks. Whenever and wherever institutions and individuals want access to the fiberlike telecommunications services currently available only in the most highly developed urban areas, the Teledesic Network can provide seamless connectivity. And, because Teledesic satellites move in relation to the Earth, Teledesic provides the same quality and capacity of service to all parts of the globe. In this sense, Teledesics InternetintheSky is an inherently egalitarian technology. On Day One of service, Teledesic will help transform the economics of telecommunications to enable universal access to the Internet and the information age.             Report on Question 162 109 ANNEX  2G  The final analysis system The following information is based on information provided by Final Analysis One of the most aggressively pursued investment, service and manufacturing opportunities in the world today resides in the newly emerging GMPCS industry. GMPCS is the acronym for global mobile personal communications by satellite  spacebased telecommunication infrastructures for the next millennium. Industry analysts and leading investors predict a booming market for new communication services delivered by global satellite constellations. These communications systems range from tens to hundreds of small satellites circling the earth and synchronized for seamless service anywhere. This is a new investment field, rapidly being filled. Only a few early investment opportunities remain as the various players rush to complete their financing, implement their systems, and begin offering customer services. Within the GMPCS industry, there are distant differences in system technologies, costs, and target markets. Some satellite systems are designed to provide voice services, catering to business travellers using handheld mobile phones. Other satellite systems are geared to offer sophisticated computertocomputer data networks in the sky. There is yet another group, Little LEO systems, capturing the imagination of investors, business entrepreneurs and markets. Because of the unique highmargin market opportunities, tested and reliable technology, and service affordability of Little Leo systems, Final Analysis Communication Services Inc. Final Analysis or FACS has chosen to operate in this segment of the GMPCS industry. Final Analysis is already positioned to be the lowcost provider and one of two industry leaders. Far from being a paper concept company, Final Analysis has designed, built and launched two satellites built, tested, and implemented three fully operational ground stations built, tested and implemented a satellite control center secured launch services for the satellite constellation and built working prototype user terminals. Digital data applications and market development are underway in several key market segments. National and international service development at a cost of over four times the Final Analysis capital investment. Little LEO satellite systems are focused on affordable messaging services targeted to the worlds underserved markets and on lowcost twoway messaging, asset tracking and data monitoring applications. These new services will be available in the near term with high volumes and low costs to target populations and industries in industrialized and developing countries alike. An advantage for Little LEO services is their ability to costeffectively serve less developed and remote regions at a profitable margin. The term, Little LEO, was originally conceived to distinguish these digital data systems from socalled Big LEO voice systems. Both will launch their satellite constellations into lowearth orbit, hence the word LEO. Little LEOs operate in the UHFVHF band below 1 GHz where the radio communication technology has been developed, tested, and successfully used since the 1970s. Big LEO systems will require significant research and development to produce radio transceivers that can reliably operate at higher frequencies at a reasonable cost, thus representing a greater technology risk than in the Little LEO market. 110  Report on Question 162 Already, Final Analysis has an initial focus on a strong portfolio of highdemand and highmargin services including Personal Messaging and Voice Mail  The Final Analysis satellite system will provide twoway paging and variable messaging alphanumeric keypad and display with message sizes exceeding current paging systems. Final Analysis voice messaging microphone and voice digitizerdecoder is an ideal solution for people unable to read or write as the service relays the recorded speech after it has been digitized into a data transmission. Final Analysis voice messaging provides a lowcost, instantly available communications system for rural areas and small villages in the developing countries that similarly lack power and phone service. Flexible Final Analysis satellites can also send large computer and data file. Tracking and Asset Management  Final Analysis ground terminals equipped with GPS receivers will provide quick, accurate, lowcost positioning information for cargo, shipping containers, rail cars, barges and trucks. Control information can be easily provided through the same equipment. Cars can have a diagnostic check up monitored and reported by satellite. Antitheft devices can report on the location of a stolen vehicle anywhere in the world and disable the vehicle through a satellite command. Commercial trucks can have customs control handled through remote sensors, which can verify that the container was not opened. Anything that moves can be tracked, thus protected. Data Monitoring and Control  Final Analysis ground terminals equipped with microprocessors will provide memory and operational systems to monitor consumable supplies in vending and copier machines, climate conditions at weather stations, crop conditions and feed supplies on large farms, utility usage at homes and businesses, water quality conditions from ocean buoys, pointofsale reports from retail stores and a wide variety of inventory management data. Currently some companies, such as utilities, are trying to implement wireless systems, but these efforts still require groundbased personnel to collect the data from individual locations by driving by the site. Satellites can read many tens of thousands of sites in one pass, providing far greater efficiency and lower cost.                  Report on Question 162 111 CHAPTER  3 3 Digital switching systems 3.1 Introduction 3.1.1 Concepts The fundamental task of telecommunications is to transfer messages. The communication system must ensure that the messages arrive at the correct receiver. The message transfer consists of the conversion of a message into signal units, the transport of these signal units, and the reconstruction of the message from these signal units. Strictly speaking, the message transfer consists of switching as well as transmission. The transmission technology makes channels available for information transmission for long periods of time. But even this availability though, is flexible and can be varied. In the early days of transmission technology, flexibility was guaranteed by the distribution frame Nowadays management commands are used to establish and direct transmission pathways. Following the further development of the control systems, transmission systems have begun to develop characteristics that have become more and more similar to those of switching technology. The major remaining difference is the control system, which uses measures of the network management transmission technology or signalling during connection setup switching technology. Both technologies are rapidly converging. Switching network The connection of terminal equipment, between which messages are to be exchanged, is performed by a switching network.  The switching network must be able to perform the following basic tasks  At any time, from every piece of terminal equipment or from every entry point, a connection to all terminal equipment on the network or the transfer to other networks must be possible in principle.  Every connection must be controllable by the user. On the one hand, the network must be in the position to fulfil the expected connection requests with sufficiently high probability, and to satisfy guaranteed quality parameters. The technical effort to satisfy connection requests must, on the other hand, be reasonably limited. The switching network is structured according to different points of view  requirements of the switching principle employed,  amount of traffic,  technical and economic parameters of the technology utilised,  regulatory requirements. 112  Report on Question 162  Figure 3.1    Switching network  subscriber terminalsourcesinknetwork nodenetwork pathtrunk groupsubscriber line    The most important elements of the network are the nodes and paths. The payload between the network nodes is transported in the paths. Network edges are connection lines which link the terminal equipment on the network and are connection trunks between the network nodes and users. Groups of connections or channels between these same network nodes are brought together in trunk groups. The payload is determined in the network nodes. Connections A connection is a coupling of at least two pieces of terminal equipment on network access interfaces, network paths and network nodes of a network for the purpose of exchanging information. For all forms of information exchange the rule is at first, a connection through the network must be created. This connection can exist continuously or it can be created for a certain time period. If the connection has been created for a limited period of time, then there must be switching. A connection then exists for the duration of the complete information transmission for example, in a telephone network or the time for the transmission of a part of the information for example, in ATM networks. The switching is carried out in the network nodes. A switching process is always carried out in connection with a definite communication relationship. Switching Switching is the creation of connections for a limited period of time in a network by means of connecting channels, which make up the partial segments of the connection. Switching is the creation of the connection by means of control signalling.   Report on Question 162 113 Switching technology All technical equipment which is used for the switching in a network can be designated switching technology. The switching technology ensures that the information in a network, according to the switching principles current in this network, reach exactly those network nodes or subscribers for which they were designated. From the point of view of the user of a network, switching is a service that can be employed in order to exchange information with one or many other users on the network. A switching node is that part of a network where by evaluating technical switching information, partial segments of the network are put together for a connection. Simultaneously, depending on the traffic volume, the traffic of many terminals on the network is concentrated on a few paths of the network by switching. The place where a switching node is located is called an exchange.  Switching nodes are distinguished according to their location in the network hierarchy as well as well as by their technical configuration. 3.1.2 Switching Principles The switching principle is the way the switching of connections or messages is carried out. Connectionless transmission The connectionless mode is appropriate for networks in which sporadic, short information segments must be exchanged between the terminals, such that the time required for setting up and terminating a connection can be reduced. For this reason, these networks have mainly developed for communication between computers. The disadvantage of this kind of network is that all nodes are loaded with traffic, even if the information is not intended for them.  Connectionoriented transmission If the time required for the setup of a connection is short compared with the time period that the connection exists, then connectionoriented service modes are more advantageous. Information is transported only to nodes that are necessarily involved with the communication. Telephone networks have evolved on this model. Connectionoriented networks can work with switched channels channel switching or the message switching packet switching or virtual connections.  Connectionoriented channel switching includes switching in the spatial domain spatial separation of the channels  spatial switching and in the time domain time multiplexing of the channels.  Message switching consists of packet switching a number of packets per message and consignment switching one packet per message.  A special position must be given to ATM switching, which is gaining in importance and will be described in Section 3.3.3. 114  Report on Question 162  Figure 3.2    Overview of switching principles     3.1.3 References Walrand, J.  Communication Networks.  Boston Irwin, 1991 Schwartz, M.  Telecommunication Networks.  Reading AddisonWesley, 1988 3.2 Channel switching  For channel switching, the relationship between the communication partners is implemented by connecting channels. After the relationship is created, the subscribers are directly connected with each other for the complete duration of the communication. The spatial switched channel is the classical form of the connection. In the simplest cases, they are made with electrical connections, which are switched together with contacts. Switched channels can be either switched or fixed connections. For switched connections, the participating terminals are automatically connected together for a certain period time, based on the destination information of the source using switching technology and signalling. Dedicated connections are created by network management measures for a certain period of time. The oldest network working on the connectionoriented principle is the telephone network.  Spatial switching is the switching of physically separated electrical channels. Spatial SwitchingTime Division SwitchingChannel SwitchingShort Message SwitchingPacket SwitchingATM SwitchingMessage Switchingconnection orientedconnectionlessSwitching   Report on Question 162 115 Time switching is the switching rearrangement of time slots in systems, in which the information from individual channels is transported in time slots. Channel switching is also designated as circuit switching. For circuit switching, the creation of a connection is necessary before the actual communication is made after the communication, the connection must be terminated again. Therefore the connection is divided into phases. 3.2.1 Connection phases  Figure 3.3    Schematic representation of the phases of a circuit switchd connection  source destinationA subscriber B subscriberswitching networkoccupydialdial switch connectioncallringinglogonreleasereleaseconnectionsetupconnectionterminationinformation exchange timetonecalling tonetone    Connection setup.  The connection setup is carried out by an exchange of signalling information between the active terminal equipment and the exchange, and between the exchanges. The initiative is taken by the terminal equipment which wants to set up the communication relationship in telecommunication technology and in the above example in Figure 3.3 Asubscriber. Thereafter follows the reservation of the switching device equipment to which the Asubscriber is connected. If this reservation is accepted, that is, if a facility is free to process the connection request, then the terminal equipment is informed in the telephone network using dial tone. Next, the terminal equipment notifies, by dialling, which other terminal it desires to connect to dial information, address information. Then an attempt is made to establish a path to the destination terminal Bsubscriber. If this is successful, then the Bsubscriber is called, and the Asubscriber is informed of the connection setup call display, in telephone network ringing tone. After the Bsubscriber has acknowledged the call log on, the connection enters into the second phase. The created occupancy is, from the point of view of the Asubscriber, an outgoing call and, from the point of view of the Bsubscriber, an incoming call. In general, the requested connection extends over a number of switching configurations, and signalling is also necessary between them. 116  Report on Question 162 Information exchange.  In the second phase of the connection the actual information exchange occurs which also can be accompanied by signalling. Thus, during the course of a connection, service components can be switched on and off and teleservices can be managed. Connection release.  The third phase of the connection is the connection release, which one of the terminals initiates by means of signalling. The switching equipment engaged and the occupied channels are released again. Data is collected for the recording of connectiondependent fees. 3.2.2 Structure of a switching system Functional blocks.  A switching configuration has a variety of functional blocks, which are either involved in or support the actual switching process  Switching Connection of subscribers by means of subscriber lines and link lines, in order to create individual communication relationships.  Administration Administration of the subscriber lines associated with the exchange, trunk lines, the equipment of the exchange and the processes which run on this equipment. The collection and processing of fee and traffic data is also included.  Maintenance The ensuring of equipment availability of the central unit.  Operation communication between the central units and their operation personnel.

This is the most general case of a switching system, because here connections to subscribers, as well as connections to other exchanges, are represented. On the left side, subscriber lines connecting terminal equipment are represented, using the user network interface User Network Interface  UNI. On the right side are trunk lines between the switching stations. Exchanges are connected by means of network interfaces Network Network Interface  NNI.    Report on Question 162 117 A connection between two terminals attached to the same switching station is called an internal connection, and is represented with dotted lines in Figure 3.4. A connection from or to a subscriber, which is attached to another exchange is called an external connection. This kind of a connection is drawn in bold lines in the Figure. Control  An important element of the switching system is the control, which processes the signalling information from and to the terminal equipment and between the exchanges. The control system obtains the necessary information for adaptation from adapters and converters and from subscriber lines and trunk lines. Switching matrix  The actual creation of connections takes place in the switching matrix, also called switching network. It is the basic element of a switching system and is set up by the control system. Periphery  The periphery of the switching system must provide additional functionality so that the switching node can successfully integrate into the rest of the environment. The most important task requirements of this periphery are  the supply of power to the subscribers line, i.e. supplying the electrical energy,  the protection of the switching system from electrical influences on the connections for example, due to cable error, voltage overload, lightning etc.,  the separation of payload and control signals for inband signalling for example, from and to subscribers in a telephone network,  the interference suppression of payload and control signals,  the conversion of message forms e.g. 2 wire, 4 wire conversion,  recognition of incoming signalling,  creation of signalling,  recognition of errors for maintenance purposes. The above functions are implemented in socalled trunk circuits and subscriber circuits. The subscriber circuit carries out the socalled BORSCHT function. BORSCHT is an English acronym for the functions  Battery loading,  Over voltage protection,  Ringing,  Signalling,  Coding e.g. analogue to digital conversion,  Hybrid 2wire, 4wire conversion,  Test error detection. 3.2.3 Task requirements of the function unit switching of a switching system For the task requirements of the most important functional units of a switching central unit, the elements of the service switching available to the user are described. The most important task requirements are  Search for a free unit for carrying out a function. Such a unit can be a free link in a certain direction path seek, but also can be a software procedure instance for realising a service characteristic.  Testing of identifications and access privileges.  The occupation of a longdistance unit upon request. This unit is assigned to a connection to be created and locked for any other attempts at occupation.  Switching on of dial tones.  Receiving and evaluation of dialling information. Reception of dialling information and evaluation in terms of the selected direction, of the subscriber or of service characteristics. 118  Report on Question 162  Signalling transmission, i.e. transmission of a telephone number from the switching system to another switching system or to terminal equipment.  Connection, i.e. creation of a connection in the switching network.  Connection termination, i.e. determination of fees, the signalling of the connection completion, release of the equipment.  The disabling of a facility from use in case of malfunction, during maintenance or for other reasons for example, to prevent traffic overload of other elements of the central unit or of the network.  Release of allocated or disabled equipment within the exchange. 3.2.4 Switching matrix The switching matrix is an arrangement of switching elements which are used to connect payload channels in a switching system. The switching network is the central element of a switching facility. With switching networks, the required connections of transmission channels between the switching exchanges are created. Based on the signalling information and available channels, the switching arrangement connects input ports and output ports. The task of the switching matrix is the setup and release of connections, as well as handling the administration of the simultaneously existing connections.  In general, a switching network consists of a number of connecting stages. They are individual layers with a multiplicity of switching elements which are functionally parallel. Function groups  The complete switching network is divided into three important functional groups, in which the traffic to be switched is concentrated, distributed, and finally expanded. The most important function is the distribution of the traffic. The required technical equipment in general is very complex and can be better utilised with concentration. The concentrationdistributionexpansion structure is functional. This basic structure of switching systems is the same for all principles that can be applied to switching, independent of whether it is switching between a variety of spatial connections, time slots or packets. Concentration.  Concentrating switching networks are used when more inputs than outputs are involved. Concentration is the switching of a number of input lines onto a few output lines. The traffic of the lightly utilised input lines is concentrated on more heavily utilised output lines. The expensive equipment assigned to the output lines is also better utilised. Distribution.  Linear switching networks are used when an equal number of inputs and outputs are involved. In distribution, the traffic is distributed according to its direction. Expansion.  Expanding switching networks are used when more outputs than inputs are involved. After distribution, the traffic must be reconstituted to the separate individual subscriber lines at the destination local exchange. The traffic is expanded.   Report on Question 162 119  Figure 3.5    Concentrating, distributing and expanding in a switching network    A connection in a switching system is processed at first with a concentrating, then a distributing, and finally with an expanding, switching arrangement. This arrangement of the individual components of the coupling network is purely functional. For the practical realisation of switching network, a concentrating and expanding switching arrangement can comprise the same physical elements. Spatiallyseparated switching matrixes  Spatiallyseparated switching is the oldest form of switching. A channel is made up of a certain number of lines wires, which are connected with electrical contacts to one another. These contacts can be implemented by means of  relays,  selectors liftrotate selector, motor selector,  coordinate switches or  electronic building blocks transistors. A switching matrix for three wires per channel and with 4  4 channels on the basis of a Strowger selector appears in Figure 3.6. An arrangement of three coupled mechanical switches represents one crosspoint. Switching arrangement.  The switching arrangement itself is a matrix, and connections can be created at the crosspoints. Figure 3.7 shows this kind of a coupling matrix in a socalled stretched representation. One crosspoint is required for a connection of an input to an output. Therefore, for m inputs and n outputs, m  n crosspoints are required. The switching network is free of blockage, which means that already existing connections cannot block new connections. Part a of the diagram shows all coupling points, while the simplified representation in part b of the diagram symbolises only the number of the inputs and outputs.  distributionconcentration expansion 1 m 1 n 1m1n1m1 n m  n m  n m  n 120  Report on Question 162  Figure 3.6    Representation of the operating principles of a mechanical switching matrix       Figure 3.7   Singlelevel switching matrix in a stretched arrangement  a complete representation  b simplified representation  InputsOutputscrosspointconnection 1123456781 2 3 4 5 6 7 81234567812345678Inputs Outputsused crosspointconnection 2    inputs outputs channel 1 channel 4channel 1  channel 4crosspoint channel 2  channel 3 channel 2 channel 3  Report on Question 162 121 Example  The coupling arrangement displayed in Figure 3.7 has m  8 inputs and n  8 outputs. Therefore m  n  64 crosspoints are necessary. Every input can be connected with every output. Existing connections do not prevent other connections from being switched when other inputs and outputs are involved. In the example, connections exist between input 4 and output 5 as well as between input 6 and output 3. Apart from the stretched arrangement, switching matrices can also be operated in the socalled reversal arrangement. In this case, inputs as well as outputs are connected on the same side rows of the matrix. The columns of the matrix serve to connect rows. For p columns of the matrix m  n  p coupling points are required. Two crosspoints are required for a connection. A maximum of p connections can exist at the same time. The disadvantage of this coupling matrix is that the connection between certain inputs and outputs cannot be created under certain conditions, because other connections already exist internal blockage.   Figure 3.8    Switching matrix in reverse arrangement  InputsOutputs12345678connection 1crosspointconnection 2used crosspointcrosspoint not available any more    Example  The coupling arrangement shown in Figure 3.8 has m  n  8 connections which could be inputs or outputs. Determined by p  8 columns of the coupling matrix, p  m  n  64 crosspoints are necessary. Every connection uses a column of the matrix in this case, drawn in grey to complete the circuit. Therefore a maximum of p connections can be switched. Every switched connection effects that the coupling points of the rows and columns required for the completion of the circuit cannot be used for other connections. The coupling points no longer in use are also drawn in grey. 122  Report on Question 162 This configuration of the coupling matrix meets an important requirement for the configuration of switching matrixes the number of the employed technical elements should be approximately proportional to connection capacity this not the case for a coupling matrix in a stretched arrangement, in this case it is a quadratic dependency. Because of the necessary requirement for extensibility, switching networks should be modularly designed. This can be achieved by dividing up large switching matrixes into smaller matrixes and then switching these matrixes together over a number of levels. With multilevel switching networks and the switching together of smaller matrixes, fewer crosspoints are required than for singlelevel switching networks. But in the case of multilevel switching arrangements, internal blockages are possible. The probability of an internal blockage goes up with the concentration factor of the switching matrix and declines with the size of the individual switching matrix. Example  The switching network, which is represented in Figure 3.9, allows for the connection of up to 100 subscribers. A maximum of five internal connections can be simultaneously set up, as well as up to three external trunk groups with up to five connections each.  For the case m  10 inputs and n  5 outputs, per switching matrix in a stretched arrangement in layer 1 m  n  10  500 crosspoints are required.  In layer 2, the switching matrices also have m  10 inputs and n  5 outputs. The 5 switching matrices of this level thus have a total of 10  5  5  250 crosspoints. In layer 3, the number of the crosspoints can be calculated from m  5, n  5 and the number of matrices which is five. This yields 5  5  5  125 crosspoints.  In total, 875 crosspoints will be required. Hence because of internal blockage, it is not possible to create more than five connections for a subscriber group out of 10 subscribers which belong to one and the same switching matrix of the first layer. Furthermore, not more than five internal connections, and not more than five connections to the external trunk group, can be created simultaneously. Two connections are displayed  line 10 of the first matrix of layer 1 connects to line 1 of the second matrix of layer 1 internal connection and  connection 3 of the 10th matrix of layer 1 connects to line 1 of the external trunk group external connection. By carefully designing the switching network layers and the connections between the layers, a compromise can be found between crosspoint number and blockage probability. This information on switching networks mainly refers to the switching of spatially separated channels, which can be implemented with Strowger selectors or coordinate switches.  But channels can also be in different forms. It is possible to assign a channel a fixed carrier frequency and switch this carrier in the switching system. Another possibility is the assignment of a time slot to a channel. In digital switching technology, the spatial and the temporal domains are utilised. In switching devices, spatial and time switching arrangements are often used in combination.

In the case of timedivision channel splitting, individual time slots are assigned the information to be transmitted in the channels. This technology, for example, is applied for PulseCodeModulation PCM. The assignment of individual channels to time slots is shown in Figure 3.10. The assignment is rigidly defined in a frame structure. The position of individual bits in the frame determine to which information relationship they belong. The synchronization which is carried out for a frame must last for the time it takes for a complete pass through the frames. A time frame is represented in Figure 3.10 a as a complete cycle of the rotating switch. 32 channels are nested in it and a cycle requires 125 ms.  Timeswitching arrangement.  The principle of a simple switching arrangement for switching the time position of an individual channel is shown in Figure 3.10 b. In this case, the information which arrives at the input in individual time slots is written to specific fields of the switching memory by a controller and temporarily stored. This writing process is controlled by a control table. The reading of information from the memory occurs in a fixed sequence. The control table contains the assignment of the time slots of the output lines to those of the input lines. It is also conceivable that the data is written in a fixed sequence and read out with a control table. 124  Report on Question 162  Figure 3.10   a Assignment from channels to time slots b Rearrangement of time slots because of intermediate storage  Inputcontrol tableOutputbswitch memory2341332257231687 2 3 1 64   3   2   1  32  31OutputInputsrotating switch a142932    In every case, storage of the time slot information is required for the rearrangement of time slots. This can occur at the input of the coupling field, at the output of the coupling field, centrally for the complete coupling matrix, or distributed for every coupling position. For a detailed representation of the storage types, refer to the section on ATM switching, because the same principles will be applied there. TimeSpace Switching.  In general, a number of PCM input lines reach a switching network. The job of the switching network consists of executing the rearrangement of the time slots as well as coordinating between PCM connections. For this, a space and time switching network Figure 3.11 is required.    Report on Question 162 125  Figure  3.11    Spatial temporal switching  SpaceTimeSwitchingNetworkinput line 323453 132123453 132123453 132123453 132123453 132123453 1321input line 2input line 1 output line 1output line 2output line 3    Example for Figure 3.11  Time slot 3 of the input line 2 is to be assigned to time slot 2 of the output line 3 solid line. For this task, a temporal and a spatial switching process are necessary. The dottedline rearrangements, in contrast, require only time switching. Technically, the spatial and the temporal switching can be carried out at the same time. For this purpose, all spatiallyseparated input lines on a line are multiplexed note for inputs, this line must have more than an nfold processing speed and stored the individual spatiallyseparated output lines of the coupling arrangement, parallel to each other, are read out of the correct time slots from the common memory. 3.2.5 Control of switching devices The special feature of the switching device control system is that a connection almost always pass through a number of network nodes and therefore a number of switching stations, and all of these switching stations are incorporated into the control system of the connection.  The transmission of control information between switching stations and fromto the terminal equipment is carried out by signalling. Every connection is built up piece by piece by selecting channels. This selection subdivides into   a forced selection, which determines the direction in which the connection will continue to be built, and   a free selection, which automatically dials up a free channel in this direction,  the forced selection is always controlled by the dial information. The dial information required for the control system of the participating switching device is created in the calling terminal. If this dial information is used directly to control the switching system, this is called direct control. If the dial information first goes to temporary storage and then is evaluated, this is called indirect control. The direct control system was introduced with the introduction of the liftrotate Strowger selector. The impulses of a dialler directly control the lift steps. In the pause between two dialled digits, the free selection of a channel in the selected direction can be carried out. The next dialled digit now directly controls a selector in the next selection level or in another switching station.  126  Report on Question 162 The indirect control system has applications mainly in SPC switching and computercontrolled switching systems. The direct control system is no longer used today. The indirect control has the following advantages  Before individual segments of a connection become occupied, it can be determined if a path can be found through the network up to the destination terminal equipment, thus avoiding the stepwise occupancy of channels before the actual effective connections can be completely made  Considerably more complex methods of path searching routing for a connection through the network can be applied than with the stepwise connection setup. 3.2.6 References ITUT Reference exchanges  Introduction and field of application Q.511 1188  Exchange interfaces towards other exchanges Q.512 0295  Digital exchange interfaces for subscriber access Q.513 0393  Digital exchange interfaces for operations, administration and maintenance Q.521 0393  Digital exchange functions Q.522 1188  Digital exchange connections, signalling and ancillary functions Q.541 0393  Digital exchange design objectives  General Q.542 0393  Digital exchange design objectives  Operations and maintenance Q.543 0393  Digital exchange performance design objectives Q.544 1188  Digital exchange measurements Q.551 1196  Transmission characteristics of digital exchanges Q.552 1196  Transmission characteristics at 2wire analogue interfaces of digital exchanges Q.553 1196  Transmission characteristics at 4wire analogue interfaces of digital exchanges Q.554 1196  Transmission characteristics at digital interfaces of digital exchanges Q.700 0393  Introduction to CCITT Signalling System No. 7 Series, Q.700  Q.788 Q.920 0393  Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 DSS1  ISDN usernetwork interface data link layer  General aspects Series Q.920  Q.957 Q.1200 0997  General series Intelligent Network Recommendation structure Q.2010 0295  Broadband integrated services digital network overview  Signalling capability set 1, release 1 3.3 Message switching  In the case of message switching, no channels are established on which the information is exchanged, but rather individual messages units, most often packets, which contain all or a part of the information to be transmitted, are switched.   Report on Question 162 127 This occurs exactly like one would imagine the switching of postal letters in a network of post offices The packets are supplied with addresses which give information about the receiver. In each switching station, the address is evaluated and the message is forwarded in a direction which brings it closer to its destination. The switching is carried out separately for each individual message unit. Therefore no connection setup is required. Packets, which belong to the same information relationship, can take different paths through the network. Store and forward switching.  Message switching is often called store and forward switching. Typical for this configuration is that the packets are lead step for step from switching system to switching system through the network. The packets are stored temporarily in each of the network nodes. 3.3.1 Packet switching Packet switching switches information that is divided into a number of packets. A packet in this sense has the following basic setup  Figure 3.12    Setup of packets in packet switching               Packet.  A message is divided into a number of units. These units are supplied with a header and a trailer. The header, payload and trailer form a packet. Packets can be of fixed or variable length. The packet trailer is not necessary for certain switching procedures. The packets are created at the transmitting terminal equipment. At the network nodes, the addresses of the packets are analysed and are forwarded in a direction which will bring them closer to their destination. For this purpose, packets need not necessarily take the same path. The forwarding process is dependent on the traffic load which is currently on the network.

At first, both transmitters allocate the transmission information into the packets 1 to 5. These are passed on to the network in the order of their numbering Figure 3.13 a. The first switching node test attempts to direct the packets on the shortest path in the direction of the receiver.

The expedition of the packets is first of all successful for both of the first packets. Now the transmission capacity on the direct connection to the receiver is exhausted for the moment and so the respective second packets are sent over the alternative lower part of the network. With this transmission, this path is also fully utilised. The third packet of the information relationship 1 must now be sent on a longer alternative along the upper part of the network, because now the first alternative also has no further transmission capacity available. Now a packet along the direct path can be accepted packet 3 of information relationship 2, the next packet packet 4 of information relationship 1 is once again sent on the shortest alternative. Packet 4 of connection 2 takes the long alternative. Once more a packet can be sent along the direct path and the last packet packet 5 of the relationship 2 can take the short alternative Figure 3.13 b. Because of the different transmission times for each route, the packets arrive at their receivers in the order shown Figure 3.13 c. The advantages of packet switching are  rapid transmission without connection setup times, especially appropriate for short, sporadic information transmission and a low number of packets,  good time and space capacity utilisation of the network resources, especially for sporadic, burstmode traffic. The disadvantages of packet switching are  transmission time varies and cannot be guaranteed,  resource cannot be guaranteed bandwidth,  packets can overtake each other see Figure 3.13 c,  higher computing power requirements for the routing of the packets. 3.3.2 Message switching Message switching conveys packets which contain the complete contents of an information relationship. A message packet which is conveyed in transmission switching, has the following design.  Figure 3.14    Setup of a packet for message switching          MessageHeaderPayloadT r a i l e r 130  Report on Question 162 The packets have a variable length. The complete contents of a message are contained in a packet. Therefore, in contrast to packet switching, there is no need for the division of the message into data blocks and the protocol overhead that results. The process does not differ from packet switching from a technical point of view. It is used, for example, for the short message service SMS in GSM networks. 3.3.3 ATM switching In the case of ATM switching, the composition of information packets is similar to that for packet switching. They all have the same length of 53 bytes. All packets of an ATM connection take the same path through the network, for which the transmission capacity has been reserved in advance. ATM switching differs from classical packet switching by the constant packet length and the determination of a connection path. This allows the switching of ATM cells to be simpler and computationally easier to control. Storage principles A requirement for the switching of ATM cells is that the cells in every switching system are temporarily stored. For this purpose, the following basic principles can be applied  Input memory Per input, the incoming cells are stored in memory on the principle firstinfirstout FIFO. For the switching process, an internal blockingfree matrix is employed. The disadvantage of this storage method is the possible blockage of waiting cells in the FIFO, so that even though the respective output is free, it is possible that a cell must wait for switching because previous cells to other outputs must be handled first.  Output memory Immediately after arriving, the cells are switched to a FIFO per output, and read out from there with the output line cycles. On the input, only the storage of one cell per lead is necessary. The disadvantage of this storage method is that the internal speed of the switching matrix must be greater than the speed of all incoming cells.  Central memory All incoming cells are stored in a common memory. This can be smaller than the sum of all separate memory requirements, but the control system for memory access is complex and very highspeed memory access is required. Distributed memory In a matrix made up of input and output lines, memory is allocated at every crosspoint to allow the multiplexing of the cells on the output lines. The disadvantage of this method is the large memory requirement. 3.3.4 Virtual connections In the case of virtual connections, individual packets are switched, but all packets of an information relationship are transmitted along only one path which is established at connection setup. Connection orientation.  Before the information exchange begins, there is a connection setup which determines if a path with adequate transmission capacity is available between source and sink. This channel is not occupied during the total connection time, but only when the transmission capacity is   Report on Question 162 131 required. If no packets are available for some duration, the transmission channel can be used for other virtual connections. The capacity of transmission sections can even, within certain limits, be overbooked statistical multiplex gain, nevertheless, all virtual connections have access to guaranteed resources and at times even have the use of more bandwidth than they were guaranteed.  Figure 3.15    Storage principles in ATMswitching             Virtual connections combine the advantages of packet switching and channel switching. They  do a good job of utilising the resource of the network an advantage of packet switching  can quickly make available large transmission capacities an advantage of packet switching  guarantee resources an advantage of channel switching, and  have a control system which is inherently less complex to realize than with a strict packet switching system. Input memoryCentral memory memory Distributed memory Output memory 132  Report on Question 162 In phase 1 connection setup, the transmission capacity along both designated paths is reserved. In order to guarantee the desired bandwidth, as in the example, both connections must be led along different paths. For the transport of the packets in phase 2 information exchange, the reservation of path and bandwidth of service quality Quality of Service  QoS ensures that packets cannot overtake each other and are delivered within the timing requirements.  Figure 3.16   The switching of packets in a switching network with virtual connections  a phase 1 connections setup  b phase 2 switching of the packets along the set paths          3.3.5 Switching and routing Switching Switching is the creation of connections in a classical telecommunications network for a limited period of time by the interconnection of channels line or circuit switching. During connection setup, which is carried out before the actual information transmission occurs, the creation of the connection is controlled by signalling. Connections can also be virtual as is the case with ATM.  Switching is carried out at layer 2 of the OSI Reference Model.

The job of the routing function is, for example, to transport datagrams in a packet network from a transmitter to one unicast or numerous multicast, broadcast destinations. For this, two subtasks must be performed   the construction of routing tables, and  the forwarding of the datagrams using the routing tables.  The routing process described here is the forwarding of data packets. It has nothing to do with path searching for switched circuits under certain network conditions, such as in the case of overload, errors, or for optimising the costs of a connection leastcost routing. The datagrams are transferred from one router nexthop to the next hopbyhop. A given router knows the next router which lies in the direction of the destination. The decision on the next router nexthop depends on the destination address of the datagram destination based routing. An entry in the routing tables contains the destination and the nexthops that belong with it, as well as supplementary data. The routing table determines the next node that a data packet must reach in order to get to the desired destination. Routing tables can be   static, or  dynamic.  In the case of static routing, the nexthop of a route is entered as a fixed location in the tables. Static routing is appropriate for smaller networks and networks with a simple topology. In the case of dynamic routing, the next hop is determined from network state information. Employment makes sense for larger networks with a complex topology and for the automatic path adaptation in case of error backup, and in case of the overloading of the network parts.  3.3.6 References ITUT References I.232.1  1188  Packetmode bearer service categories Virtual call and permanent virtual circuit bearer service category I.232.2  1188  Packetmode bearer service categories Connectionless bearer service category I.232.3  0393  Packetmode bearer service categories User signalling bearer service category USBS I.233  1091  Frame mode bearer services, ISDN frame relaying bearer service and ISDN frame switching bearer service I.233.1 Annex 0796  Frame mode bearer services ISDN frame relaying bearer service  Annex F Frame relay multicast General References Schwartz, M.

It is characterized by the switching of narrow band channels. The telephone network is the oldest telecommunication network in the world. The first switching functions were also introduced into this network.

Figure 3.17    Structure of the worldwide telephone network        3.4.1 Local network In the lowest level of the telephone network is the local network to which the subscriber is connected. It is made up of local exchanges, terminal exchanges and dependent exchanges which are remotely controlled from local exchanges.  Local networks can be of different sizes. While on the one hand, digital concentrators can be employed for very small local networks with up to a few hundred subscribers, if the number of subscribers is a few thousand then remotecontrolled switching stations are employed. Very large local networks can have up to 100,000 subscribers. They are implemented with independent local exchanges. The subscriber is connected to the local network by means of subscriber lines. The local exchanges are tied together by local trunk lines.  Local network 1 Local exchangeInternational long haul networkNational long haul network Local network 3 Local network 2Tertiary exchange Regional exchange Main exchange Terminal exchange DependentexchangeSubscriber136  Report on Question 162 3.4.2 Long haul network Local networks are connected through national long haul networks. These are mapped by the regional exchanges, main exchanges and tertiary exchanges. This structure can also be expressed in the subscriber numbering i.e. within a local network, only the telephone number of the subscriber is selected in order to connect to a another subscriber in the same local network. From outside the local network, the user must dial the local network code and furthermore, for a subscriber in another country, the country code.  Local networks and long haul networks internally can contain a number of hierarchical levels in some countries, though, no difference is made between the local and the longdistance level. It is possible, that the actual path that a connection takes in the network does not follow the hierarchy set by the numbering. By means of socalled traffic routing, shorter and therefore more efficient paths are possible. Digital, computercontrolled telecommunications systems contain numbering schemes that are independent of the hierarchical structure of the network.  The national long haul networks of the individual countries are again networked through the international long haul network. This is subdivided once more into two network levels the intercontinental longdistance network has exchanges in New York, London, Sydney, Moscow and Tokyo. The sublevel is constructed by the continental longdistance networks. The continental longdistance networks have the following codes 1  North America 2  Africa 3 and 4 Europe 5  Central and South America 6  Australia, Oceania 7  Russian Federation 8  Asia without Russia, India and the Arabic countries 9  India and the Arabic countries. 3.5 Connectionless messages transfer 3.5.1 Principles In connectionless message transfer, the transfer is carried out in packets that include both the source and the destination addresses. All packets reach all network nodes and terminals of the respective network. Every receiver looks for and retrieves his own messages based on the address information given. This form of message transfer is especially used in networks for data transmission, for example, LAN or WAN applications. The advantage of this method lies in the ability to send information without previously setting up a connection. Additionally, no routing mechanism is required. This is especially advantageous for sporadically occurring, short information relationships. The transmission is possible only in frames or packets. Since the packets contain source and sink addresses, no connection setup and termination is required. The packets are transmitted spontaneously. But the availability of sufficient resources in the entire network cannot be guaranteed, nor whether the sink has the ability to accept the transmitted information. Therefore measures are required to ensure that a message has really reached the sink.   Report on Question 162 137 This is implemented with protocols, at higher levels of the OSI reference model. A shared medium is a transmission medium that is used by a number of communication relationships. The transmission capacity for a specific connection is dependant upon the traffic of all other communication relationships. Media access.  Since no connections for individual information relationships have been made, all existing information relationships must share the transmission medium shared medium. For this reason, there is always a time frame and regulation for the media access. This can either be based on chance and uncoordinated, i.e. access is not previously agreed upon with other stations random access, or the stations are given transmission rights at predetermined time slots token access. Network topologies.  Figure 3.18 shows the possible network configurations for connectionless message transfer. One can see that no hierarchical composition of the network is possible as would be the case with tree or meshed networks.  The interconnection of connectionless networks, which would imply the creation of hierarchies, makes it necessary to selectively make a distinction between internal traffic source and sink are contained in the same network and external traffic source and sink are located in different networks. For this purpose, bridges and routers have become typical network elements of LANs and WANs. They analyse the address information of the data packets and filter the external traffic for the transfer to the next higher network level. If connectionless service in networks with connection setup is offered, special network nodes servers are required which accept connectionless traffic and after analysing the address information, pass it on. This causes a logical subnetwork of fixed address connections to be created for the connectionless traffic.  Figure 3.18   Network topologies for connectionless messages transfer  a Star network  b Bus network  c Ring network   a b c     3.5.2 Individual techniques CSMACD  carrier sense multiple accesswith collision detection. This method applies the probabilistic access on the transmission medium which is not synchronized with other stations. The medium is queried for a short period of time before transmission. If it is free, the station transmits, otherwise a waiting period must pass and then the medium is queried again. A collision can occur if a number of 138  Report on Question 162 stations have queried at the same time and then begun to transmit as soon as the medium is free. CSMACD is standardized in IEEE 802.3. The network topology is a bus Figure 3.18 b. A typical example of CSMACD networks is Ethernet. Ethernet can reach a transmission capacity in excess of 10 Mbits. Currently work is being conducted on the standardization of a gigabit Ethernet which should reach a transmission capacity of 1 Gbits and will also be applicable for widearea networks. Token Ring.  The token model is a deterministic media access process with a decentralised control system. A transmission permission token is passed on from station to station. A station ready to transmit occupies a free token and sends a message. In this way, a new token is created. In the token ring process, the token circulates on a physical ring. The network topology is represented by Figure 3.18 c. The token transfer is carried out along the physical ring. A typical token ring process is the IBM token ring as described in IEEE 802.5. Token Bus.  With this method, all stations connected on a bus see Figure 3.18 b form a logical ring. The token transfer forward is carried out with the addresses of the connected stations. The addresses of the previous and subsequent stations must be known. An example of a token bus process is described in IEEE 802.4. FDDI  Fibre Distributed Data Interface. FDDI uses the token bus process in a double ring structure with counterdirectional rings constructed of fibre optic connections. The data is transported in packets of variable length. FDDI systems are designed to be errortolerant and are conceived for a high transmission capacity in a High Speed LAN  HSLAN of up to 100 Mbits. The access procedure permits synchronous service as well as asynchronous data transmission. In this case, every station is assigned a fixed part of the bandwidth. DQDB Distributed Queue Dual Bus. While FDDI, token model, and CSMACD were developed for the transmission in local area networks, DQDB is the transmission procedure in MAN Metropolitan Area Networks. It is described in the standard IEEE 802.6. For DQDB, the transmission is carried out with a frame structure on a double bus running in opposite directions. Depending on which direction the sink is located which is to receive messages from a station, a transmission is requested on the bus of the opposite direction. If a free slot in the desired transmission direction arrives, then it is occupied. With this process, a distributed wait queue develops at each of the stations. The stations can transmit their information with equal rights and without conflicts depending on the general state of the network. 3.6 Abbreviations ATM Asynchronous Transfer Mode BORSCHT Battery, Over voltage protection, Ringing, Signalling, Coding, Hybrid, Test CSMACD Carrier Sense Multiple Accesswith Collision Detection DQDB Distributed Queue Dual Bus DSS1 Digital Subscriber Signaling system No. 1 ETSI European Telecommunications Standards Institute FDDI Fibre Distributed Data Interface.

These signals were originally rudimentary change of state and frequency combinations. They have since become more and more elaborate in digital networks, taking the form of messages and information elements and taking advantage of the parallel developments of data communication technology e.g. the OSI model. The evolution of telecommunication networks towards the IDN Integrated Digital Network followed by the NISDN Narrowband Integrated Services Digital Network saw the emergence of common channel signalling systems in the network Signalling System No. 7 between network nodes and in the subscriber loop Digital Subscriber Signalling system No. 1 between customer premises equipment and the network.  These systems have over the last 20 years really become the nervous systems of modern telecommunication networks, and have met the goals set by the initial designers in the 70s,  reliability and flexibility. They have evolved from the provision of signalling capabilities for basic POTS services, to the provision of a complex toolbox, a family of functions and protocols, needed by the network operators to build a variety of services for their customers POTS, ISDN, cellular, broadband... and to optimize their network operation e.g. the Intelligent Network concept. Current developments are tackling the convergence or the interworking with the IP world. The following sections aim to give an overview of the current developments. 4.2 Signalling system No. 7 SS7 Signalling System No. 7 was the second common channel signalling system recommended by CCITT in 1980, after 8 years of study. It integrated in the telephony environment, the principles and techniques of data communication networks, developed in the framework of the Open System Interconnection model, while taking into account the specific signalling requirements such as high level of security and realtime constraints. In order to provide flexibility and the ability to evolve, the system is designed in a modular and structured manner, with a clear separation between the basic functions providing the reliable transport of signalling messages Message Transfer Part and the application related functions User Parts. Some User Parts may also share common functions such as the Signalling Connection Control Part SCCP and the Transaction Capability Application Part TCAP. This continuous effort towards more structure and commonality between signalling applications can be easily seen in the successive edition of SS7 Recommendations since 1980. The following sections give an overview of the family of SS7 protocols for narrowband services. 142  Report on Question 162 4.2.1 Message Transfer Part MTP 4.2.1.1 Introduction The Message Transfer Part MTP provides the functions that enable significant information from the User Part to be passed via the MTP across the Signalling System No. 7 network to the required destination signalling points. In addition, functions are included in the MTP to enable network and system failures that would affect the transfer of signalling information, to be overcome. MTP procedures ensure that messages originated by a user at a signalling point are delivered to the same user at the destination point indicated by the sender without loss and duplication of messages.  The MTP is split into sublevels 1 Physical level level 1 or signalling data link 2 Data Link level level 2 or signalling link 3 Network level level 3 or signalling network management.  The functions of each level of the MTP are performed by means of the level protocol between two systems which provides a level service to the upper levels i.e. level 1 Signalling Data Link, level 2 Signalling Link and level 3 Signalling network as described in Recommendations Q.702, Q.703 and Q.704 respectively.  The overall objectives of the Message Transfer Part are to provide the means for a the reliable transport and delivery of User Part signalling information across the SS7 network a the ability to react to system and network failures that affect the transport, and take the necessary action to ensure that the permanence of the service.  4.2.1.2 Description For more details refer to ITUT Recommendations Q.702 up to Q.707. Level 1 signalling data link A signalling data link constitutes of the lowest functional level level 1 in the Signalling System No. 7 functional hierarchy. It is a bidirectional transmission path for signalling, comprising two data channels operating together in opposite directions at the same data rate.  A digital signalling data link is made up of digital transmission channels and digital switches or their terminating equipment providing an interface to signalling terminals. The digital transmission channels may be derived from a digital multiplex signal at 1544, 2048 or 8448 kbits having a frame structure as defined in Recommendation G.704 1. Signalling System No. 7 is able to operate over both terrestrial and satellite transmission links. Level 2 signalling link The signalling link functions, together with a signalling data link as a bearer, provide a signalling link for reliable transfer of signalling messages between two directly connected signalling points. The main features are message delimitation, sequence validation, error checking and flow control. When an error occurs on a signalling link, the message or set of messages is retransmitted. Two retransmission methods are defined, the basic procedure for terrestrial links where round trip delay is less than 30 ms, and the Preventive Cyclic Retransmission procedure mainly for satellite links or terrestrial links with round trip delay greater than 250 ms. For round trip delays which are between the two boundaries, any method can be used.   Report on Question 162 143 A MTP level 2 message is called a signal unit SU. There are three kinds of signal units FillIn Signal Units FISUs, Link Status Signal Units LSSUs, and Message Signal Units MSUs. FillIn Signal Units FISUs are transmitted continuously on a signalling link in both directions unless other signal units MSUs or LSSUs are present.  FISUs carry basic level 2 information only e.g., acknowledgement of signal unit receipt by the remote signalling point. As a checksum is calculated for each FISU, signalling link quality is checked continuously by both signalling points at each end of the link.  Link Status Signal Units LSSUs carry one or two octets of link status information between signalling points at either end of a link. This information is used to control link alignment and to indicate the status of the link at the remote end. Message Signal Units MSUs carry all user data given by the upper level MTP level 3. The differentiation between FISU, LSSU and MSU is made based on the length of the SU. The value of the LI Length Indicator field determines the signal unit type     The message length is limited up to 279 octets. For more details refer to ITUT Recommendation Q.703 Level 3 Signalling network management Signalling network management is divided into two basic categories  Messages handling  Network management.  MTP Level 3 is equivalent in function to the OSI Network Layer. Message handling MTP Level 3 routes messages based on the routing label of message signal units. The routing label is comprised of the destination point code DPC, originating point code OPC and signalling link selection SLS fields. The destination and the originating point code are uniquely identified by numeric addresses in the SS7 network. At the destination, the MTP distributes the message to the appropriate MTP user identified in the message SIO. Network management Groups of procedures are provided to manage failure and recovery of elements in the network link, linkset, and node. Groups are  Link management  Route management   Traffic management. LI Message type 0 FISU 1 or 2 LSSU 3 .. 63 MSU 144  Report on Question 162 Whenever a change in the status of a signalling link, route, or node occurs, the different procedures in the sets are activated as appropriate. Link management Linkset control offers management at linkset level. Signalling link activity control to supervise all actions made at link level. Signalling link activation control used for first activation and link introduction in the network management.  Signalling link restoration used to restore a failed link after traffic management procedure completion. Signalling link deactivation to stop traffic on a link and to delete the link from the network management. Route management Transfer prohibited control Transfer Prohibited TFP is used by a Signalling Transfer Point to inform all adjacent nodes that a particular individual destination is no longer reachable through it. Signalling route set test control is used to check the routes status from a remote STP knowledge.  Transfer allowed control Transfer Allowed TFA is used by a Signalling Transfer Point to inform all adjacent nodes that a particular individual destination is now reachable through it.  Transfer controlled control is used to inform adjacent node that path to reach a destination is currently congested. Traffic management Changeover control performs traffic diversion from a currently failed signalling link towards one or more available signalling link.  Changeback control performs traffic diversion from one or more backup signalling links towards an available signalling link which had previously failed. Link availability control performs the synchronization of different events that have impact on routing tables at a link basis. Forced rerouting control performs traffic diversion from a currently failed signalling route towards one or more available signalling routes. Controlled rerouting control performs traffic diversion from one or more backup signalling routes towards an available signalling route which had previously failed. Signalling point restart performs smooth introduction of the node in the SS7 network when restarting. It is also used when an adjacent node is restarting.  Signalling traffic flow control performs the management of a congestion situation detected either locally or remotely.  Signalling routing control performs the synchronization of different events that have impact on routing tables at a destination basis. For more details refer to ITUT Recommendation Q.704.   Report on Question 162 145 4.2.1.3 Future developments Since 1996, ITUT Q.704 Recommendation provides, as a national option, a definition of a High Speed Signalling link that allows a 2 Mbits signalling link based on nonchannelized PCM. The used of such a link is for countries where ATM transport is not yet in operation. For those countries where ATM transport is available a solution using MTP3, ATM in place of MTP levels 1 and 2 is preferable. 4.2.2 Signalling Connection Control Part SCCP 4.2.2.1 Introduction The Signalling Connection Control Part SCCP provides, above the MTP network or networks, connectionless, and connectionoriented services to transfer circuit related and noncircuit related signalling information or other types of information between nodes for management and maintenance purposes. The combination of the MTP and the SCCP is called the network service part NSP. The Network Service Part NSP of SS7 provides both connectionless and connectionoriented protocol. The NSP of SS7 should be seen as the network layer of the OSI Reference Model. The SCCP provides the means to  control logical signalling connections in a SS7 network  transfer Signalling Data Units across the SS7 network with or without the use of logical signalling connections. The protocol used by the SCCP to provide network services is subdivided into four protocol classes, defined as follows  Class 0 Basic connectionless class  Class 1 Sequenced connectionless class  Class 2 Basic connectionoriented class  Class 3 Flow control connectionoriented class. 4.2.2.2 Description SCCP provides a routing function which allows signalling messages to be routed to a signalling point based on, for example, dialled digits. This capability involves a translation function which translates the global title e.g. dialled digits into a signalling point code and possibly a subsystem number. In the routing function, congestion control measures are provided to reduce traffic in the event of MTP congestion, SCCP congestion and SCCP node congestion. SCCP also provides a management function, which controls the availability of the subsystems, and broadcasts this information to other nodes in the network, which have a need to know the status of the subsystem. An SCCP subsystem is an SCCP User. The SCCP intends to provide compatibility functions to allow transparent and optimal use of the different nature of MTP networks networks using narrowband links or broadband links such ATM. Unfortunately in the current version this function is provided only to connectionless services. Further study is needed to extend this function on connection oriented services. For more details refer to ITUT Recommendations Q.711 up to Q.716. 146  Report on Question 162 Routing function Addressing is the first essential aspect of communication that allows establishing an association between two SCCP users. SCCP allows users to use logical addressing of the remote entity. In such a case, Global Title Translation derives an SS7 Network Address e.g. the physical address of this remote user. If the association between the logical and the final physical address is not locally possible, the SCCP delivers the message to the next SCCP node to provide the association. This propagation is done until a translation in a SCCP node along the path delivers the final association between this address and a local SCCP user. The various addressing information elements used by SCCP routing function SCRC are 1 Point Code PC  This uniquely identifies a node in an MTP SS7 network. This PC identities the next SCCP node. 2 Global Title GT  This is an address used by the SCCP, comprising dialled digits or another form of address, that will not be recognized by the SS7 Network Layer. Therefore, translation of this information to an SS7 Network Address is necessary. 3 SubSystem Number SSN  This identifies a subsystem accessed via the SCCP within a node and maybe a User Part e.g. SCCP Management or an Application Entity containing the TCAP layer.  According to the priority of the message and to the congestion level of the destination next SCCP node derived from the GT, the message is sent or discarded. According to network capabilities all along the path, segmentation is performed or not. Connectionless services The connectionless protocol classes provide those capabilities that are necessary to transfer one user message in the data field of an SCCP message. When one connectionless message is not sufficient to convey the user data making use of MTP services provided by a narrowband MTP network that supports a maximum MTP message length of 272 octets including the MTP routing label, a segmentingreassembly function for protocol classes 0 and 1 is provided. In this case, the SCCP at the originating node or in a relay node provides segmentation of the information into multiple segments prior to transfer in the data field of SCCP messages. At the destination node, the segments are reassembled before delivery to the user. If it is certain that only MTP services supporting long messages according to Recommendation Q.2210 are used in the network, then no segmentation of the information is needed. Protocol class 0 User data, passed by higher layers to the SCCP in the originating node, is delivered by the SCCP to higher layers in the destination node. They are transferred independently of each other. Therefore, they may be delivered to the SCCP user outofsequence. Thus, this protocol class corresponds to a pure connectionless network service. Protocol class 1 In protocol class 1, the features of class 0 are complemented by an additional feature i.e. the sequence control parameter contained in the request primitive which allows the higher layer to indicate to the SCCP that a given stream of User data shall be delivered insequence. The originator chooses the Signalling Link Selection SLS parameter used for routing in the MTP SCCP based on the value of the sequence control parameter. The SLS shall be identical for a stream of User data with the same sequence control parameter. The MTP then encodes the Signalling Link Selection SLS field in the routing label of MTP messages relating to such User data, so that their sequence is, under normal conditions, maintained by the MTP and SCCP. With the above constraints, the SCCP and MTP together ensure insequence delivery to the user. Thus, this protocol class corresponds to an enhanced connectionless service, where an additional insequence delivery feature is included.   Report on Question 162 147 Connection oriented services The connectionoriented protocol classes protocol classes 2 and 3 provide the means to set up signalling connections in order to exchange a number of related user messages. The connectionoriented protocol classes also provide a segmenting and reassembling capability. If a user message is longer than 255 octets, it is split into multiple segments at the originating node, prior to transfer in the data field of the SCCP messages. Each segment is less than or equal to 255 octets. At the destination node, the user message is reassembled before delivery to the user.  Protocol class 2 In protocol class 2, bidirectional transfer of user data between the user of the SCCP in the originating node and the user of the SCCP in the destination node is performed by setting up a temporary or permanent signalling connection consisting of one or more connection sections. A number of signalling connections may be multiplexed onto the same signalling relation. Each signalling connection in such a multiplexed stream is identified by using a pair of reference numbers, referred to as local reference numbers. Messages belonging to a given signalling connection shall contain the same value of the SLS field to ensure sequencing as described in sequenced connectionless. Thus, this protocol class corresponds to a simple connectionoriented network service, where SCCP flow control and loss or missequence detection are not provided. Protocol class 3 In protocol class 3, the features of protocol class 2 are complemented by the inclusion of flow control, with its associated capability of expedited data transfer. Moreover, an additional capability of detection of message loss or missequencing is included for each connection section in such a circumstance, the signalling connection is reset and a corresponding notification is given by the SCCP to the higher layers. Management The goal of SCCP management is to provide procedures to maintain network performance by rerouting or throttling traffic in the event of failure or congestion in the network. For this purpose, SCCP management procedures rely on 1 failure, recovery, and congestion information provided in the MTP management indication primitives MTPpause indication, MTPresume indication and MTPstatus indication and 2 subsystem failure and recovery information, and SCCP SSN  1 congestion received in SCCP management messages. SCCP management maintains the status of remote SCCP nodes and the status of remote or local subsystems. It informs local users through local broadcast and remote SCCP nodes with either broadcast or response to messages received.  SCCP management cooperates with the SCCP routing control including translation function to stop traffic to inaccessible destinations and to provide rerouting of traffic through alternate routing or through selection of alternate remote subsystems. SCCP management information is transferred using the SCCP connectionless service. 4.2.2.3 Future developments No major enhancement is foreseen. 148  Report on Question 162 4.2.3 Transaction Capabilities TC 4.2.3.1 Introduction The Transaction Capabilities TC of Signalling System No. 7 provide support for interactive signalling applications that are not associated to a bearer. Typical applications are interactions between a switching centre and an external database or between two databases. At present, the major users can be found in the area of Intelligent Networks i.e. INAP and mobile networks i.e. MAP. TC may be viewed as a particular realization of the Remote Operations paradigm defined in Recommendation X.880 ROS. Interactions between TCUsers are modelled by operations. An operation is invoked by an originating entity, the other destination entity attempts to execute the operation and possibly returns the outcome of this attempt. 4.2.3.2 Description TC is best understood as a package that provides a Remote Procedure Call RPC mechanism over SS7 networks. In OSI terms, it can be compared to the collection formed by the Remote Operations Service Element ROSE  See Recommendation X.881 and X.882, Association Control Service Element ACSE  See Recommendation X.217 and X.227 and in some way the Presentation Layer See Recommendation X.216 and X.226.  TC is modelled as being composed of two sublayers a The component sublayer CSL which provides the actual remote operation service and allows the TCUser to control the association if any over which the requests and replies are exchanged. b The Transaction sublayer TSL which provides if required an endtoend connection service between two TC entities.  Transaction SubLayer  The Transaction sublayer directly interfaces with the Signalling Connection Control Part SCCP which provides the SS7 connectionless network service. In some ways, it replaces some missing transport layer functionality. Similar to the transport layer, the TSL is used either in a connectionoriented mode, which implies the establishment of a transaction, or in a connectionless mode. The TSL uses the following messages to transport the protocol data units exchanged between two component sublayers  The Begin message is used to open a transaction.  The Continue message is used to transfer information during an established transaction.  The End message is used to close a transaction.  The Abort message is used to refuse the establishment of a transaction, or to abandon an established transaction in case of protocol errors. Each message can carry one or more protocol data units generated by the component sublayer. Component SubLayer  The component sublayer is further divided into two functional blocks  a The component handling CHA block which provides the core remote operations service b The dialogue handling DHA block that provides a simple association control facility. The protocol data units that are generated or interpreted by the CHA are called components. These are  The Invoke component is used to request a remote user to perform an action i.e. to execute an operation.   The Return Result Not Last and Return Result Last component are used to signal the successful completion of an operation.  The Return Error component is used to signal the unsuccessful completion of an operation.  The Return Reject component is used to signal a protocol error.   Report on Question 162 149 These PDUs are completely aligned with those defined in Recommendation X.880, with one extension. This addition is a specific PDU, Return Result Not Last, whose sole purpose is to carry segments of the result of a successfully completed operation whose length exceeds the maximum length of connectionless SCCP userdata.  The DHA services are used to control of the establishment and release of a dialogue association. Controlling the dialogue establishment includes the ability to negotiate an application context. The DHA also enables the TCUser to control the concatenation of one or more PDUs in a single TSL message. The protocol data units of the DHA are a subset of those defined in Recommendation X.217 for the Association Control Service Element ACSE.  4.2.3.3 Future developments No further changes to TC Recommendations are expected. Additional common application layer elements e .g. for security management may be defined for use in combination with TC. However, it is assumed that they will not require any enhancements to TC. 4.2.3.4 Road map The following Recommendations currently define the Transaction Capabilities of Signalling System No. 7  Recommendation Q.771 0697 Transaction Capabilities  Functional description of transaction capabilities.

This made it necessary to define a new signalling protocol capable of carrying a lot of information, in the forward direction and also in the backward direction, during the call setup as well as during the call itself. The ISDN User Part ISUP was defined to support the ISDN, that is allowing ISDN subscribers to have their services taken into account, but also offering new services to the analogue subscribers and covering new requirements coming from the Intelligent Network IN concept.  4.2.4.2 Description 4.2.4.2.1 Call identification and routing Since the signalling information is carried on dedicated and circuit independent signalling links, each message contains information allowing every switch involved in a call to bind all messages among themselves within the call, and also to the circuit seized for the call. Each message contains a routing label as defined in the MTP recommendation originating point code  point code of the sending switch 150  Report on Question 162 destination point code point code of the adjacent switch and the CIC Circuit Identification Code a unique circuit identity between two adjacent switches. The IAM Initial Address Message, first message of the call setup contains the Called party address that is the E.164 address of the called user, used to route the call. By this way, each message, whatever its direction, is recognized as related to a unique call by any switch on the call path. 4.2.4.2.2 ISUP syntax The ISUP signalling consists of messages. Each ISUP message is contained in the information field of an MTP message. As was stated above, each message contains the routing label followed by the CIC, by the message type code and by the application information itself. This application information is composed of mandatory parameters of fixed length, pointers to each mandatory parameters of variable length and to the optional part, mandatory parameters of variable length, optional parameters of variable length. 4.2.4.2.3 ISUP features The purpose of ISUP is to support basic bearer services and supplementary services for applications in an integrated services digital network 4.2.4.2.3.1 Basic services The ISUP usually supports 3 bearer services speech, 3.1 kHz audio and 64 kbits, but it is capable of multirate and N  64 kbits. This bearer service is initiated by the originating local exchange in case of analogue calling user usually 3.1 kHz or by the ISDN calling user in the DSS1 Setup message. For the routing aspect, besides the called party number, the ISUP allows an ISUP signalling to be required preferred or mandatory and to indicate in the backward direction if the ISUP has been used. Moreover, ISUP messages convey information elements provided by ISDN users. The ISUP also provides procedures for the circuit supervision blockingunblocking, reset and for echo control. 4.2.4.2.3.2 Simple segmentation The simple segmentation procedure uses the segmentation message to convey an additional segment for the transfer of certain messages whose contents are longer than 272 octets MTP limit but no longer than 544 octets. 4.2.4.2.3.3 Compatibility A main issue in the ISUP protocol is that 2 switches can be interconnected without having exactly the same implementation of the ISUP. Before ISUP92, when a switch received an unrecognized message or parameter, the unrecognized information had to be discarded. In ISUP92, an enhancement was introduced such that each new message or parameter is accompanied by compatibility information indicating to switches that do not recognize the message or the parameter what they have to do discard, passon, release call, .... This allows a network to be upgraded in certain exchanges i.e. local exchanges without having to upgrade other exchanges i.e. transit exchanges. 4.2.4.2.3.4 Application transport mechanism APM In the ISUP2000, the support of APM was introduced to convey embedded information related to specific applications such as VPN Virtual Private Network. APM is a mechanism supported by the ISUP via a specific parameter carried by call handling messages, or by a specific message part of the ISUP when call handling messages are not available at the moment APM information is to be sent.   Report on Question 162 151 4.2.4.2.3.5 Supplementary services The ISUP supports several services. This support is based upon the ISUP itself or is combined with generic procedures taking into account the SCCP level. For some supplementary services, the ISUP conveys information that has to be handled by switches. For other ones, the ISUP is only a way of carrying notification information, in particular when a supplementary service is locally provided, e.g. on a DSS1 access. For each ISUP version, the supplementary services supported by the ISUP are listed. Among all the supplementary services supported, here are some examples  CLIPCLIR Calling Line Identification PresentationRestriction  the called party number is transmitted in the Initial address message to be displayed at the destination access.  CUG Closed User Group  the CUG information is transmitted by the Initial address message to be analysed by the CUG application in switches that are concerned.  UUS UsertoUser Signalling  this ISDN service consists of exchange of information between ISDN users.  CFU, CFNR, CFB Call Forwarding Unconditional, No Reply, Busy  the information related to the type of call forwarding and to the called identities is conveyed for handling e.g. charging purposes or to be displayed either in local switches or on DSS1 accesses.  CCBS Completion of Calls to Busy Subscriber  this service is initiated by the ISUP Release message indicating to the originating local exchange that the busy called user can be called again when he becomes free. The rest of the procedure is supported by SCCP.  4.2.4.3 Future developments The ISUP protocol is being enhanced to take into account new requirements. For example, in the ISUP2000, number portability has been considered, that is new procedures such as redirection procedure and pivot routing and new information have been introduced. Other requirements come from IN. Indeed, IN services require more and more information exchanged between IN nodes or between IN nodes and switches or users. Another evolution is the use of the ISUP to support new bearers such as ATM or IP. To allow a fast ATMIP backbone networks deployment, a study has started to derive a new ISUP, based on the NISUP, capable of call handling independent of the bearer. The result will be a new ISUP protocol, interworking with the NISUP.  4.2.4.4 Roadmap Q.761 to Q.764 and Q.730 series 2000 ISUP2000 APM, VPN, number portability, IN CS2, new supplementary services 1997 ISUP97 new procedures, IN CS1, new supplementary services 1993 ISUP92 White Book segmentation, compatibility, new supplementary services 1991 ISUP Q.767 subset of ISUP for international interface 1988 ISUP Blue Book  4.2.5 Intelligent Network Application Part INAP 4.2.5.1 Introduction A broad range of services is now available in modern telecommunications. Market liberalization makes it possible to offer an increased choice of features to customers while boosting revenue streams for operators and services providers. To compete successfully and make the most of new opportunities, network operators must take a fresh look at network infrastructure, costs and flexibility, and tailor services to changing customer expectations. 152  Report on Question 162 Applying the Intelligent Network solution is an answer to this new challenge, applicable for all networks. The main benefit of the IN is the ability  to ease the introduction of new services without impacting the underlying network structure   to provide service customisation according to individual needs   to enable smooth upwards evolution  to improve sources of revenue, and to provide a fast return on investment  to reduce the cost of network service operations  to establish vendor independence  to create open interfaces. 4.2.5.2 Description Intelligent network is an architectural concept which is intended to be applicable to fixed, mobile, Internet, data and other networks as well as narrowband, data, or multimedia communications. A phased standardization process has been initialised and is now on the way to deliver the Capability Set 3 Recommendations. In order to ensure a smooth evolution towards the target, each IN Capability Set of Recommendations allows backward compatibility and is openended towards longterm views. An Intelligent Network is made up of a set of functional entities that fit together as depicted in the figure hereafter. Each of these entities could be supported by an independent physical node but they also could be located in the same platform. Modularity of integration enables an operator to step into IN services at a low level while making it possible to grow to larger IN solutions. The CCF is the call control function in the network that provides callconnection processing control. The SSF identifies an IN call, recognizes the requested services, and executes the SCF commands. The SSF is more often supported by a switch e.g. in a fixed or mobile network. The CUSF is the counterpart of the SSF for calls which do not require the use of a bearer.   Figure  4.1    Functional entities of an intelligent network   CUSF SSF CCF SRF SCF SDF SMF SMAF SCEF To others SDF To others SCF To others  SDFSCF To others  SDFSCF To others  SDFSCF Network boundary SCF    Service  Control function SDF    Service Data  Function CCF Call Control function CUSF Call Unrelated Service Function SSF Service Switching Function SRF Specialized Resource Function SMF   Service Management function SMAF  Service Mangement Access Function SCEF  Service Creation Environment Function       Report on Question 162 153 The SCF contains the real time functions of service scenarios, monitors events through the SSF, requests voice prompt and receives user control through specialized resources managed by the SRF function. The SDF is the database that contains all the service data, e.g. the IN service user profile. The SMF centralizes all function needs for management, as well as to customize services, configures alarms, and other related functions. The SMAF provides an interface between the service managers and the SMF. The SCEF is the software tool set that enables service creation and development.  These functional entities exchange information via standardized interfaces using the ASN1 method for coding. The transport is more often the SS7 TCAPSCCP system but nothing prevents the use also of TCPIP technology. CS1 Recommendations describes the first basic set of IN capabilities applicable for a two party call. These capabilities enable services to provide   flexible Triggering  flexible Routing  flexible Charging  flexible User Interaction. Based on these capabilities, a large range of IN CS1 services are now deployed, e.g. the whole set of prepaidpostpaid card services, Virtual Private Networks services, the 800 numbers services, user mobility as UPT. CS2 Recommendations enlarge the scope by adding   flexible connection command this enables to supervise IN call with several users involved,  interoperator interfacing refer to SCFSDF, SDFSDF, and other functions, see Figure 41.  service for calls without the use of a bearer e.g. for managing mobility, see CUSF in Figure 41.  CS2 services are not yet deployed. They will certainly be much more user oriented than network oriented.  CS3 is under stabilization and could be seen as CS2 refinements, as it does not really add major new features.  More information can be found in Fascicle 2 Chapter 2.3 of this Handbook. 4.2.5.3 Future developments The future of IN is open, the most important challenges on the table are the integration of the Internet network, the adaptation to Voice Over IP Technology and the mobility with the Virtual Home Environment concept applicable to the new generation of mobile networks in the IMT2000 family. 4.2.5.4 RoadMap IN Capability Set 1 Q.1214 to Q.1219 May 1995 IN Capability Set 2 Q.1224 to Q.1229 September 1997 IN Capability Set 3 Q.1238.1, Q1238.2, Q.1238.3, Q.1238.4.

The D channel of a usernetwork access line carries the signalling for the channels of the same line. It has the essential purpose of allowing all ISDN services to be offered in an integrated manner. It is intended for use by the many types of subscriber equipment liable to have access to public and private networks. The D channel protocol is structured into layers The physical level layer 1 of the usernetwork interface is defined at the S point to multipoint or T point to point interface in basic 2B  D or primary 30B  D rate access. The link level layer 2 provides for transmission of frames between the two entities on each side of the interface. The network level layer 3 assures control and supervision of calls and supplementary services. It is known as the Digital Subscriber Signalling System Number 1 DSS1. 4.3.2 Description 4.3.2.1 Call control DSS1 functions for call control involve message handling and management of the resources assigned to the call, for circuit, packet and connectionless modes. 4.3.2.1.1 Protocol design Communication between the user and the network for call control purposes is by means of variable length messages. DSS1 provides a procedure so that the messages that are longer than the length of frames that the data link layer can support may be partitioned into several segments. Several types of messages have been specified, each of them determining an action on the user or network side. For instance  SETUP for a call set up request.  CALL PROCEEDING, as a response to the SETUP, means that call information is complete and the call is being set up.  ALERTING indicates that the called user is being alerted.  CONNECT sent at the called user response  DISCONNECT, RELEASE and RELEASE COMPLETE, used for the release of the call. Each message contains information elements, usually of variable length, that define the type of request, the resources to be reserved, addressing features or the result of a processing operation. For instance  Bearer capability indicates the requested bearer service to be provided by the network Circuit mode  Packet mode, Speech  64 kbitssec., etc.   Channel identification indicates the B or D channel to be used for the call.   High layer compatibility provides a means which should be used by the remote user for compatibility checking.   Calling party number and Called party number provides addressing information. 4.3.2.1.2  Control of circuitswitched calls Each call is provided with a call reference, chosen by the initiating side. The Bchannels to be used is negotiated, at the setup of the call, between the user and the network.   Report on Question 162 155 Service indications and addresses are provided by the calling terminal. They determine the functions to be performed in the network and allow the right terminals to be selected on the called subscribers premises. 4.3.2.1.3 Control of packetswitched calls ISDN users may have access to packet switched services supplied by a public switched packet data network PSPDN or by a Packet Handling function within the ISDN. When transfer of information is through a Bchannel, the Dchannel procedure for setting up the connection is the same as for a circuitswitched call. The call request packet is sent when the physical link has been established. The Dchannel can also be used for the transfer of packets. 4.3.2.2  Control of supplementary services Three methods are specified for the control of supplementary services the stimulus procedure, the feature key management procedure, and the functional procedure. In the stimulus protocol, the request is generated by the user by pressing a function key or digit keys. It is not interpreted by the terminal which inserts it in the keypad information elements of SETUP or INFORMATION messages and ignores the type of the request. In the user to network direction, information is provided in the Display information element and displayed on the terminal without interpretation. Only the network analyses the information to determine the necessary actions, which does not need any standardization of the supplementary services on the usernetwork interface. The stimulus procedure simplifies terminal design and facilitates the introduction of new supplementary services. The feature key management procedure is also a stimulus procedure in the sense that it does not require knowledge of the supplementary service by the users terminal equipment. It is based on the use of two information elements. The Feature activation information element may be included in the SETUP and the INFORMATION messages in the usertonetwork direction. The feature indication information element may be included in basic call control messages in the networktouser direction. The supplementary service associated with the feature identifier is service provider dependant and must be coordinated between the user and the service provider at subscription time. In the functional procedure, the terminal analyses the userinput information and inserts the request in a dedicated information element or in the Facility information element common to several supplementary services and inserted in call control or FACILITY messages. Both the terminal and the network analyse the information, so the functional procedure needs to be closely defined for every supplementary service. The functional protocol allows for the design of powerful supplementary services. 4.3.2.3 Future developments New supplementary services are continuously defined in the functional procedure. The DSS1 has also recently been extended for the handling of calls between users in a corporate telecommunication network. The DSS1 protocol is being enhanced to take into account new requirements linked to the handling of supplementary services by IN servers, transparently to the originating exchange. 156  Report on Question 162 4.4 Broadband signalling  4.4.1 Low layers supporting BISDN signalling UNI The transfer of the DSS 2 signalling information at the UNI is made by using the protocol stack as follows    The PH and ATM layers are not specific to signalling and are the same for both user plane and control plane UNI and NNI. The physical layer can be any one of the transmission systems capable of carrying ATM cells. The ATM layer allows multiplexing of signalling information with the user plane information on the same physical layer. As per VPI, VCI  5 is reserved exclusively for the transport of signalling information. At the UNI, the VPI used depends on the UNI access configuration. By default, VPI  0 is used. NNI At the NNI, either the ATM network, or, as a national option, the Signalling System No. 7 network can be used for signalling information transfer. The protocol stack used when an ATM network is used is    BMTP 3 is an evolution of the NISDN MTP 3 which includes changes to be used above SAAL. These changes are  SAALBMTP 3 primitives,  New code values to identify BISUP e.g. new service indicator,  Maximum size of SDU is changed from 272 octets to 4091 octets,  Adaptation of the changeover procedure. DSS 2 SAAL ATM I.361 PH I.432 BISUP BMTP 3 Q.2210 SAAL ATM I.361 PH I.432   Report on Question 162 157 As a national option, when the Signalling System No. 7 network is used, the protocol stack is the following    In this case, it should be noted that the segmentation function defined in BISUP is to be used. SAAL The ATM Adaptation Layer is defined as enhancing the services provided by the ATM layer to support the functions required by the higher layer. SAAL is a particular type of AAL used for the support of signalling. As shown in the previous figures, the SAAL is then used at both sides, UNI and NNI. The SAAL is a combination of two sublayers, a common part and a service specific part. The SAAL makes use of the common part and service specific part of AAL type 5 as defined in I.363.5. For SAAL, the service specific functions are performed by a combination of the Service Specific Connection Oriented Protocol SSCOP and two types of Service Specific Coordination Function SSCF, one to map the particular requirements of the UNI DSS 2 layer 3 protocol to the SSCOP services, and one to map the particular requirements of NNI to the SSCOP services. The SSCOP is a protocol which provides mechanisms for the establishment and release of connections and the reliable exchange of information. The SSCFs are not protocols, they only provide mapping between the SSCOP and either DSS 2 or BMTP 3  BISUP. ATM forum annex For both sides, UNI and NNI, the ATM Forum only uses the ATM lower layers for signalling information transfer. The ATM Forum protocol stack is as follows   The UNI 4.0 and PNNI 1.0 are both based on the ITUT DSS 2 standard. Therefore, the SAAL used at UNI and NNI are the same, the one defined by ITU but making use of only one Service Specific Coordination Function SSCF, the one defined by ITUT for UNI i.e. refers to Recommendation Q.2130.

This description does not intend to be exhaustive, but especially focuses on features which show ATM networks to advantage, such as traffic and quality of service capabilities, and handling of traffic parameters during the active phase of calls. Finally, a complete listing of BISUP Recommendations is provided, as well as a short description of the signalling systems specified by the ATM Forum. 4.4.2.2 BISUP signalling protocols BISUP signalling protocols are specified in the ITUT Q.27xx series of Recommendations. This paragraph mainly covers capabilities contained in Q.27614 set of Recommendations. A complete listing of BISUP Recommendations is given in Annex A. 4.4.2.2.1 Pointtopoint Switched Virtual Channels The handling establishment and clearing of pointtopoint ATM switched Virtual Channel connections is described in Recommendations Q.27614. The last version of these Recommendations, namely BISUP 2000 0799, contain the following capabilities  support of Quality of Service, as specified in I.356  support of Individual Quality of Service parameters  support of ATCs as specified in I.371  support of negotiation during connection setup  modification procedures  support of Frame Relay  support of routing on E.164 and AESA address formats  crankback procedure  negotiation of AAL parameters. Two other kinds of virtual connections are also defined in BISUP  Soft Permanent Virtual Channel connection Soft PVCC  Soft Permanent Virtual Path Connection Soft PVPC. These capabilities allow reestablishment of either a PVCC or a PVPC using the basic call procedure mentioned above if case of failure. This is specified in the ITUT recommendation Q.2767.1.   Report on Question 162 159 4.4.2.2.2 Signalling of the ATM Transfer Capabilities and associated traffic parameters Endsystems connected to ATM networks will generate a wide diversity of traffic behaviours. Therefore an ATM virtual channel connection has to be set up with the ATM Transfer Capability ATC which fits the concerned endsystem traffic behaviour. The ATCs supported in BISUP and defined in ITUT Recommendation I.371, are Deterministic Bit Rate DBR, Available Bit Rate ABR, ATM Block Transfer ABT DTIT, Statistical Bit Rate SBR1, SBR2, and SBR3. These ATCs are signalled in the Broadband Bearer Capability. Each ATC is described by a set of traffic parameters   DBR PCR Peak Cell Rate  ABR PCR, MCR Minimum Cell Rate, ECR Explicit Cell Rate, CI Congestion Indication, NI Noincrease Indication  ABT DTIT PCR, SCR Sustainable Cell Rate, BCR Block Cell Rate  SBR PCR, SCR and MBS Maximum Burst Size. These traffic parameters are signalled in the following BISUP parameters ATM Cell Rate, Additional ATM Cell Rate, ABR parameters, minimum ATM Cell Rate. A successful pointtopoint connection set up means that a Virtual Channel connection VC with the requested traffic characteristics has been allocated between the Calling and Called users across the ATM network. The compliance of the traffic generated by the source is then checked by the UPCNPC Usage Parameter ControlNetwork Parameter Control, performing the GCRA algorithm. The Cell Delay Variation Tolerance CDVT which is used by GCRA algorithm can also be indicated via signalling. This enables change of GCRA parameters on a per call, and per Virtual Channel connection, basis. 4.4.2.3 Negotiation of traffic parameters The negotiation procedure provides to the user means to set up a virtual channel connection, for which two sets of traffic parameters can be specified. Two kind of negotiations are offered to the user 1 based on a maximum and a minimum cell rate specified by the user in its set up request, the network allocates to the connection any possible cell rate allowed by the Connection Admission Control CAC function, between these extreme cell rates 2 either the cell rate specified is the original cell rate or the alternative cell rate is allocated to the connection. This procedure can be applied, in the forward and backward directions, to the following traffic parameters Peak Cell Rate, Sustainable Cell Rate, and Maximum Burst Size. 4.4.2.4 Modification of traffic parameters During the active phase of a call, the calling user, as the owner of the virtual channel connection, has the ability to modify the traffic related resources attributed to that connection. The traffic parameters which can be modified are Peak Cell Rate, Sustainable Cell Rate, and Maximum Burst Size. 160  Report on Question 162 The modification procedure offers two different options 1 simple modification  the request issued by the user indicates only one possible value to be considered for modification of the PCR of the virtual connection 2 modification combined with negotiation  the user is allowed to specify either a maximum and a minimum cell rate value, or an alternative cell rate value. In the former case, the traffic characteristics of the active connection are modified and set to any possible value allowed by the CAC function between the minimum and maximum cell rate. In the latter case, the traffic characteristics are modified using the alternative cell rate value. The combined procedure allows modification of a wider set of traffic parameters, namely Peak Cell Rate, Sustainable Cell Rate, and Maximum Burst Size. Note that ABR and ABT also have their own specific modification capabilities. 4.4.2.5 QoS Class indication and support of individual QoS parameters As ATM networks aim at transporting information flows with different quality of service classes, a user who initiates an ATM VC connection request must have the ability to indicate his own quality of service requirements. BISUP provides such a mechanism, in compliance with the definition of quality of service specified in ITUT Recommendation I.356. A user setting up a connection, signals a specific quality of service class, among a set of authorized classes. This class is relevant to routing and resource allocations in the network. If the connection is successfully established, this means that a quality of service corresponding to the indicated class is guaranteed endtoend by the network. BISUP supports the four QoS classes recommended in I.356 1995. A QoS class is an aggregate of performance parameters Cell Delay Variation CDV, Cell Transfer Delay CTD, and Cell Loss Ratio CLR. A particular QoS class is a combination of bounds on these performance parameter values. Moreover, BISUP also supports signalling of the performance parameters individually. This feature is provided for interworking with private ATM networks. Therefore, such parameters are not relevant either to routing, or to resource allocation, and are updated by each BISUP node across the network, and delivered to the destination side. 4.4.2.6 Pointtomultipoint SVCs BISUP also specifies signalling procedures for the setup of unidirectional pointtomultipoint virtual channel connections. Such a connection is made up of a root party, and several leaf parties. The root party which sets up such a connection, initiates a setup request with a Broadband Bearer Capability indicating a pointtomultipoint connection, towards a leaf party. The information such as ATM Cell Rate and Broadband Bearer Capability, is stored by the root party. The addition of any subsequent leaf party is performed by the root, upon request from the leaf parties or the root itself. During the active phase of the pointtomultipoint connection, the dropping of a leaf can be initiated either by the leaf itself or the root. A common procedure is used. 4.4.2.7 Supplementary services The supplementary services supported in BISUP, described in Recommendation Q.2730, are the following  Usertouser signalling  Calling Line Identification PresentationRestriction  Direct Dialling in   Report on Question 162 161  Connected Line IdentificationRestriction  Subaddressing  Multiple Subscriber Number  Closed User Group.

The DSS2 signalling system enables the control of switched ATM connections at the UsertoNetwork Interface UNI of the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network see Rec. I.413.  Annex A gives a list of the DSS2 signalling Recommendation in force. Annex B provides a general overview of the differences between the ITUT DSS2 signalling system and the ATM Forum UNI signalling specifications UNI 3.14.0. 4.4.3.2 DSS2 signalling protocols DSS2 signalling protocols are specified in the ITUT Q.29xx series of Recommendations. This clause gives a description of the major capabilities currently supported in DSS2.  4.4.3.2.1 Pointtopoint ATM switched virtual channels Rec. Q.2931 Recommendation Q.2931 published in 1995 constitutes the basic foundation of the DSS2 signalling system, on top of which extensions are built for the support of additional signalling capabilities such as pointtomultipoint connection control, negotiationmodification of ATM traffic characteristics, as described in the following subclauses. This Recommendation is closely based on the equivalent narrowband DSS1 Q.931 Recommendation and has been adapted for the control of ATM virtual channels instead of 64 kbits based circuits.  Recommendation Q.2931 specifies the signalling protocol for the establishment, maintaining and clearing of ATM pointtopoint Switched Virtual Channels SVC at the BISDN UsertoNetwork Interface UNI. The basic capabilities supported by this Recommendation are  support of pointtopoint bidirectional connections with symmetric or asymmetric bandwidth requirements  support of one and only one connection per call  signalling of the ATM traffic characteristics requested for the SVC This consists of an indication of the I.371 ATM transfer capability ATC and the associated ATM traffic parameters. Rec. Q.2931 1995 enables the establishment of constant bit rate CBR ATM bearers with symmetric or asymmetric peak cell rate characteristics. Since the publication of Rec. Q.2931 1995, new ATM transfer capabilities have been defined and can be signalled as specified in the Q.2961 series of Recommendations see clause 2.3 for more details  signalling of the Quality of Service QoS characteristics requested for the SVC This consists of an indication of the QoS class and optionally of endtoend transit delay requirements. Rec. Q.2931 1995 only allows for the signalling of the implicit QoS class associated with the requested ATC. Since the publication of Rec. Q.2931 1995, explicit signalling of the requested QoS class is supported in DSS2 see Q.2965.1 in clause 2.6   support of E.164 addressing schemes and ATM End System Address AESA as specified in ITUT Recommendation E.191  support for the signalling of user application dependent characteristics This consists of signalling the characteristics of the layers above the ATM layer such as the ATM adaptation layer or the layers above.  Note  Recommendation Q.2933 extends Rec. Q.2931 by defining a BISDN frame relay bearer service allowing a single frame relay connection to be carried on an ATM SVC using AAL type 5 and the I.365.1 service specific convergence sublayer.    Report on Question 162 163 4.4.3.2.2 Pointtopoint ATM switched virtual paths Rec. Q.2934 This Recommendation specifies extensions to Rec. Q.2931 allowing the control of Switched Virtual Paths SVP.  4.4.3.2.3 Signalling of ATM traffic capabilities Rec. Q.2961 This multipart Recommendation provides extensions to Rec. Q.2931 to enable the signalling of I.371 ATM transfer capabilities such as DBR, SBR, ABR or ABT. In addition, a specific Q.2961 part provides extensions in order to support the optional signalling of the associated I.371 CDVT values Cell Delay Variation Tolerance. 4.4.3.2.4 Negotiation of ATM traffic parameters Rec. Q.2962 This signalling function specifies extensions to Rec. Q.2931 that allow a calling user to negotiate with the network and the called user, on the traffic characteristics of a connection during the callconnection establishment phase. Two exclusive modes of negotiation are defined in Q.2962   negotiation between a set of traffic parameter values and a set of alternative ATM traffic parameter values   negotiation of individual ATM traffic parameters between their respective requested nominal value and their respective minimal acceptable traffic parameter value.  4.4.3.2.5 Modification of ATM traffic parameters Rec. Q.2963  This multipart Recommendation defines extensions to Rec. Q.2931 that allow the calling user to request a modification of the ATM traffic parameters of an already established pointtopoint connection i.e. during the active phase of the callconnection.  Part 1 is limited to the modification of Peak Cell Rate values, while Part 2 extends the modification to the Sustainable Cell Rate parameter set. Part 3 enhances the previous two parts by allowing negotiation to be performed while modifying traffic parameters. 4.4.3.2.6 Signalling of Quality of Service QoS characteristics Rec. Q.2965 Recommendation Q.2965.1 amends Rec. Q.2931 and specifies the signalling of the Quality of Service classes as defined in Rec. I.356. Recommendation Q.2965.2 approved December 1999 provides extensions to Q.2965.1 in order to enable the signalling of individual QoS parameters i.e. Cell Transfer Delay CTD, Cell Delay Variation CDV and Cell Loss Ratio CLR. 4.4.3.2.7 Pointtomultipoint Switched Virtual Channels Rec. Q.2971 This DSS2 signalling Recommendation specifies the control of pointtomultipoint switched connections which once established allow a source named root in Q.2971 to broadcast information to a root selected number of destinations called leaves in Q.2971. A pointtomultipoint virtual channel connection is a collection of associated ATM virtual channel links that connect two or more endpoints. This capability only supports unidirectional transport from the root to the leaves. Parties can be added and removed during the lifetime of the connection. This Recommendation is based on extensions to Rec. Q.2931 for the initial establishment of the connection between the source and one leaf.  After this establishment request has progressed to alerting or active state, additional leaves can be added to the connection by add party requests from the root allowing the root to widen the broadcast of information. A leaf may be added or dropped from the call at any time while the call is in the active state. A new leaf can be added via the root issuing an add party request, as described above. A leaf can be dropped from the call by either the root or by the leaf.  164  Report on Question 162 Multiple add party requests pending at the same time are allowed e.g. the root node does not need to wait for a response related to one add party request before issuing the next one. Multiple drop party requests pending at the same time are allowed i.e. the root does not need to wait for a response related to one drop party request before issuing the next one. Each add party or drop party request is exclusively related to one party. If, as a result of a drop party procedure, there are no leaf parties remaining in the call, the entire call is released.  The root can also release at any time the entire connection and the attached leaves. 4.4.3.2.8 Generic identifier transport Rec. Q.2941 This signalling function allows the transport of application dependent identifiers between endsystems when establishing a connection or when releasing a connection. The information is carried transparently by the networks, through which the connection is established. This endtoend transfer of signalling identifiers is useful in order to correlate at the application level, multiple calls as being part of the same session. This signalling function is used in many endsystem distributed applications when making use of ATM signalling such as H.321H.310, DSMCC, and H.323 over ATM. 4.4.3.2.9 Supplementary services Q.295x series DSS2 supplementary services are defined in the Q.295x series. They support the following signalling capabilities  additional addressing capabilities such as Direct Dialling In DDI, Multiple subscriber number MSN or Subaddressing SUB  calling line identification CLIP and the associated restriction service CLIR  connected line identification COLP and the associated restriction service COLR  usertouser signalling type 1 which allows the exchange of information between endsystems during the establishment phase or the release phase see Q.2957.1  closed user group facilities CUG as specified in Q.2955.1  handling of multiple priority levels during callconnection i.e. Q.2959. 4.4.3.2.10 Generic functional protocol Rec. Q.2932.1 Recommendation Q.2932.1 is an adaptation of the DSS1 Q.932 Recommendation in order to enable similar functions to be applicable in the context of ATM signalling. This protocol enables the transport of remote operations locally across the UNI. Three transport modes of ROSE operations are defined and can be used depending on the signalling and user application requirements. The bearer related transport mode defines the transfer of ROSE operations in relation with existing bearers controlled via ATM signalling. The connection oriented bearer independent COBI and the Connectionless bearer independent CLBI transport modes allow the transfer of ROSE operations independently of any existing bearer and differs one in the way ROSE operations are carried at the UNI.

Question 162 169 ANNEX  A  Other ATM Signalling Protocols The ATM Forum has developed its own suite of NNI signalling protocols  Private Network Interface v1.0 PNNIv1.0.  Broadband Inter Carrier Interface BICI which is an ATM Forum endorsement of some BISUP Q.27xx recommendations. While BISUP is viewed by the ITUT as an intra network interface as well as an inter network interface, BICI is considered as an inter network interface only i.e. BICI should only be used at administrative boundaries.  ATM Inter Network Interface AINI which was recently approved and provides means of interworking between PNNI and BISUP. Actually the PNNI specification defines two different protocols  PNNI Routing  which is a routing protocol for an ATM network similar features also exit in IP networks. PNNI Routing is a link state routing protocol. It gives state and topology information to PNNI nodes and enables them to dynamically route ATM VCs and VPs. PNNI Routing is extremely scalable and was specified to work just as well in small as in very large networks.  PNNI Signalling  is the actual signalling protocol. PNNI Signalling is almost the same as UNI 4.0 signalling. Since UNI 4.0 is based on DSS2 recommendations, one can consider that so is PNNI Signalling. There is no UNI 4.0PNNI interworking specification since as a result of UNI 4.0 and PNNI Signalling close relationship, interworking between the two is quite straightforward.  PNNI is not an SS7 network signalling protocol. It is transported on ATM VCs using the Signalling AAL SAAL. There is no support of ISDN services in PNNI, and no ISUPPNNI interworking specification. With the existence of PNNI Routing, this is the main difference between PNNI and BISUP. PNNI supports Switched VCCs, Switched VPCs, and Soft PVCs. Regarding Traffic Management, PNNI does not support ITUT Recommendations like I.371 and I.356 as is. Instead, it is based on the ATM Forum Traffic Management v4.0 TM 4.0 specification and thus supports Constant Bit Rate CBR, realtime Variable Bit Rate rtVBR, non real time Variable Bit Rate nrtVBR, Available Bit Rate ABR and Undefined Bit Rate UBR. Finally, PNNI does not support native E.164 numbers and can only route calls on ATM End System Addresses AESA. The PNNI, BICI and TM 4.0 specifications can be found on the ATM Forum web site httpwww.atmforum.com.      170  Report on Question 162 ANNEX  B  DSS2 and the ATM Forum UNI signalling specifications B.1 Introduction The ATM Forum is working in parallel with ITUT on the specification of UNI ATM signalling. This has led to the publication of UNI 3.1 September 1994 and UNI 4.0 July 1996. The scope of this Annex is to give a general overview of the differences at the functional level between the DSS2 and the ATM Forum UNI signalling systems. In particular, the intent of this Annex is not to provide the detailed differences between the protocols themselves and to identify possible interoperability issues, but rather to give the reader the list of signalling functions provided in UNI 3.1 and UNI 4.0.

Since PCM was invented and introduced into global communication networks, synchronization has been one of the most essential factors in the communication system design and maintenance.  In a digital transmission system, synchronization is an essential receiver function. Here binary information is converted by means of a modulator into a continuoustime signal, which is sent over the transmission channel. A digital receiver extracts the information sequence from a discretetime signal obtained after sampling and quantizing the distorted signal presented to the demodulator. At the receiver, accurate timing recovery is critical to obtain performance close to that of the optimal receiver 1. Nowadays, synchronization has evolved into an autonomous research area that has been studied in depth over recent decades.  The goal of communication network synchronization is to provide two necessary conditions for real time digital information exchange between users  The continuity, which means that bit rates must be the same for interconnected terminals  The integrity, which means that information elements bits, bytes or blocks must been received in the sink in the same order as they were sent from the source. In other words, synchronism signifies a common time reference for transmitter and receiver. Correspondingly, synchronization is a crucial operation in the reception of data signals. Two categories are commonly recognized 2,3   Signal synchronization, where symbol timing, carrier phase, and carrier frequency of a receiver are aligned with an incoming signal,  Frame synchronization, where burst, packet, word, code, or frame boundaries are recovered from a received data stream. Correspondingly, in practical applications synchronization tasks for communications are divided into three levels, such as 4  The carrier synchronization  The bit timing  The frame or block alignment. The first task deals with the carrier frequency phase tracking while in operation. The second task is important for modern digital communications and dealing with digital bit sequences. It is known as Network Synchronization or Synchronization Network, bit timing or bit synchronization. This is the main subject of this chapter. Finally, frame block alignment is the synchronization task for packetised transmission systems. Two types of synchronizer structures can be distinguished with this.   DA synchronizers use the receivers decisions decisiondirected or a training sequence in computing the timing estimates.  NDA structures operate independent of the transmitted information sequence.   Report on Question 162 173 5.2 Synchronization of the transmission systems At the early stage of PCM development, local synchronization of the pointtopoint communication was the problem. As usually, digital signal consists of two elements, such as  a stream of binary digits bits that is data  the instants in time discrete points of time at which the bit occur. In practice, the second element is a timing signal known as a clock. Figure 5.1 shows example of the data signal with associated clock. As may be seen, unit intervals are uniformly distributed in time so that each unit interval contains only one bit. The negativegoing edge of the clock pulse is a boundary between bits in a continuous binary stream.   Figure 5.1    Example of data signal and associated clock             Clock waveform Data bits Unit Interval time      5.2.1 The Clock Signal Extraction from Binary Data stream Timing clock is necessary for data processing in both the transmitter and in the sampling of data bits in the receiver. There is no need to transmit the clock waveform jointly with the data as the latter contains the clock signal information 5. Figure 5.2 illustrates this finding in the time domain. Considering this Figure in detail the modulo two sum Dt   Dt  tD of the data signal Dt and delayed signal Dt  tD gives a pulse sequence spaced with random intervals due to random nature of the signal edge time points. In Figure 5.2, as an example the delay time tD is taken as 14 part of a unit interval T. Signal dt  Dt  Dt  tD may be presented as algebraic sum of deterministic and random parts st and rt      trtstd   Note, the deterministic systematic part st is the desired periodic clock signal sequence as pulses are separated by an equal time unit distance. 174  Report on Question 162 As can be seen from Figure 5.2, both signals st and rt are sequences of rectangular pulses. It is known that covariance of the periodic pulse sequence st is also a periodic function Rs  with the same repetition period T. However the covariance of the random signal rt is the nonperiodic function Rr which has a triangular shape in the time duration DD tt  . Total covariance of the signal dt is presented as superposition of particular covariances          rsD RRR   Figure 5.2    Extraction of timing information from data                           TtE D42Dt  Dt  tD 0 0 tD T t 0.5 1.0 t 0.5 1.0 t 0.5 1.0   TtE D42t 0.5 1.0 t 0.5 10 Dt Dt  tD rt st Rst Rrt   Report on Question 162 175 Power spectrum density Gdf of the signal dt is defined through covariance RD  by Fourier transform WienerKhintchin transform based on which we realize that      ,fGfGfG rsd   where the power spectral density Gsf of the signal st has discrete shape due to its periodic nature, and that Grf of noise rt is a continuous function due to its random origin. Figure 5.3 shows, for example, total GDf and particular spectrums Gsf and Grf of the signal dt. Here function Grf is considered as envelope of the total spectrum. Note the key properties of the spectrum Figure 5.3. The spectral line with n  1 represents the power of the sine signal with the frequency 1T and is considered as the clock signal. By extracting this sine signal from the total dt one may form a correspondent clock signal intended for synchronization.  Figure 5.3    Power spectral density     Thus, there is no need to send both data and associated clock signals through transmission systems because the timing signal may be recovered from the data stream by means of Dt  Dt  tDsequence generation and the clock frequency component f0  1T filtering from the spectrum of this pulse sequence. Two opportunities are realized for this case based on  Narrow bandpass BP filter may be an optimal filter with central frequency f0  1T,  Phase lock loop PLL with low pass LP or optimal filter. 5.2.2 Pointtopoint synchronization Usually, a bidirectional digital line provides transmission for digital communications based on two digital transmission channels which are the means for unidirectional digital transmission of digital signals between two points. For this case, the essence of pointtopoint synchronization is illustrated by Figure 5.4 6. The simplest synchronization technique usually applied is that used by the Plain Old Telephone Service POTS in the early days of PCM transmission. Here independent synchronization of each channel with clock rates f0 and f1 is used in accordance with the following structure Figure 5.4a. f 4T 3T 2T 1T 0 Gdf Grf Gsf Clock line 176  Report on Question 162  Figure 5.4 a    Independent synchronization             It is known that the performance of communications systems are dramatically improved with implementation of digital methods. At the same time, once digital communication networks are implemented, then master and slave synchronization network nodes require accurate timing of the data. In this case Figure 5.4b, the transmitter of the main node sends a PCM data stream with a clock rate f0 to the slave node.    Figure 5.4 b    Slaved synchronization             PCM bit sequence CLOCK   Receiver Transmitter CLOCK Receiver Transmitter PCM bit sequence CLOCK   f0 CLOCK   f1 Tributary channels Tributary channels THE SLAVE NODE CLOCK  Receiver Transmitter CLOCK Receiver TransmitterPCM bit sequence PCM bit sequence CLOCK   f0 CLOCK   f0 Tributary channels Tributary channels THE MASTER NODE   Report on Question 162 177 Here the receiver at the slave node derives the clock signal from the data by using the methods described above. The clock signal extracted is used as a reference for adjusting the clock of a slave node transmitter. Thus, both PCM data streams are transmitted with the same clock rate f0.  Finally, Figure 5.4c shows a typical structure of a synchronous network or networks synchronized by an external accurate master clock. Here PCM bit sequences are transmitted through the network with a clock rate f0 in both channels in both directions. With respect to external master clock, both clocks of the first and second transmitters are slaved. In this case, the reference timing signal must be distributed amongst all the telecommunication network nodes that are included in this synchronization network planning. Below we will consider this question in detail.  Figure 5.4. c    Synchronous network              5.3 PLL based techniques In nonsynchronized communication systems, a freerunning oscillator determines the sample instants at the receiver, and digital processing of the sample sequence provides time correction. In synchronized systems, in order to realize data synchronization in slave nodes it is necessary to get correspondent circuits embedded into transmitting equipment. Such circuits are of feedback type and based on a digital PLL design intended for phase time disciplining of a slave clock via an external reference signal from a master clock. Generally, there are two recognized PLL circuits intended for 1 discrete time correction, 2 continuous time correction. 5.3.1 Slave clock correction in discrete time Figure 5.5 shows the generalized structure of a PLL feedback circuit intended for discrete time correction of the slave clock using a discrete time reference signal of the master clock.

Initially, the slave clock provides a timing signal for the transmitter based on the external crystal oscillator XO signal. Naturally, the signal formed does not coincide with that of the reference source because of frequency drift and phase shift. To eliminate this timing error, the TED compares the time signals of the reference source and the slave clock, and forms an error signal corresponding to the time difference between the time sources. The error signal passes through the LP Optimal filter to the TEC, which makes the correction to the slave clock timing . Because of the relatively low cost of the XO and its low noise jitter, discrete time correction is widely used now for many practical applications. 5.3.2 Oscillator disciplining in continuous time In the continuoustime domain, timing adjustment can be performed by controlling the sampling phase of oscillator. Figure 5.6 displays a correspondent structure of a PLL based feedback circuit intended for direct tracking of the slave oscillator in continuous time via a reference signal from the master clock.  Figure 5.6    PLL feedback circuit with reference signal control   TED LP Filter VCXO SlaveCLOCK Reference Timing Signal Slaved Timing Signal     The circuit operates in a similar way to that considered in Figure 5.5. Here the continuous signal of VCXO is compared with the reference one and a filtered error version of the TED output is fed to the device that determines the sampling instants e.g., a VCXO. In this way, the error signal passes through a LP filter and directly controls the oscillator frequency to eliminate the phase time shift between the two signals. Because of its relatively high cost and noise jitter, the use of a VCXO as a discrete component is to be avoided, if possible.   Report on Question 162 179 5.4 Timing correction  It follows from the Figure 5.4 analysis that accurate timing recovery at the receiver is critical to obtain performance close to that of the optimal receiver. Receiver synchronization is based on statistical methods of timing signal estimation. A major part of synchronizer algorithms can be related to the Maximum Likelihood ML criterion 3 according to which the estimates of timing parameters maximize the likelihood function. Correspondingly, the likelihood function depends on the signal modulation format and the statistical properties of the noise added to the signal. The timing estimates maximize the likelihood function, which is obtained by averaging over the random information variables. Timing estimation may be done for both multitone modulation and single carrier signals. According to the ADSL standard 7, a single unmodulated carrier must be received for timing extraction. The frequency of this carrier called the pilot is fixed. In comparison with the multitone signal, synchronization by means of a pilot has several disadvantages 1.  Because the timing estimator exploits only a fraction of the received signal power, the variance of the timing error estimate is larger than the variance obtained when taking the multicarrier approach.  To achieve the same error variance, the closed loop bandwidth of the feedback PLL synchronizer must be decreased. As a result, the capability of the synchronizer to track frequency offset variations is affected.  When using an unmodulated tone, the timing error estimate becomes sensitive to a systematic, nontimevarying disturbance such as temperature, aging, etc.  If the SNR at the pilot frequency happens to be low, the estimator produces unreliable timing estimates or much more time is necessary for timing signal estimation. We consider below major approaches for timing correction in time and frequency domains based on timing error estimates. 5.4.1 Error correction in discrete time domain  For many years, many methods have been developed to realize a fractional delay in the discrete time domain 8. Usually, the timing correction is performed by means of a finite impulse response interpolation filter Figure 5.7.  Figure 5.7    Timing correction in discrete time domain  InterpolationFilter FFTADCXO    Dvt  st  tD svk sv 180  Report on Question 162 The coefficients of the filter depend on the time error tD to be corrected. The input signal st  tD is transformed by the ADC into a digital form sv  k, where the coefficient k corresponds to time delay tDv . Controlling the signal corresponding to the time error estimate Dvt  affects on the interpolation filter by changing its coefficients in a way which leads to the corrected signal appearing at the filter output. As a result, the signal spectrum at the output of the FFT receives the desired attenuation of the spectral amplitudes and rotation of the phases. For ADSL 7, this method turns out to be applicable. For veryhighrate systems, such as VDSL, this approach cannot be used because of the high sampling rate and computation complexity involved. In VDSL, however, one can use synchronizer circuits that exploit the delayrotor property 1. 5.4.2 Error correction in frequency domain In a case of a nonzero slave clock frequency offset, the time error tD increases linearly in time. Whereas ideally the timing error correction should be different for each signal sample, the TEC will correct the timing for each sample over the same delay. Because of the delayrotor property, this timing correction can be performed in the frequency domain by rotating the FFT outputs as shown in Figure 5.8 1.  Figure 5.8    Timing correction in frequency domain  Skip FFTADCXORotor    The skipping corrector makes discrete signal control on the integer part Dv  of the total estimate of time error Dvt  so that, in the simplest case, the error to be corrected is  1. The fractional part Dk  of Dvt  is corrected by rotation of the spectral components kS  of the signal which leads to the desired spectral shape kS  at the output of the rotor. A merit of this method is its low complexity. No oversampling at the receiver input is required, and, for each carrier, correction is performed by a single complex multiplication. This method works well only when a small frequency offset can be guaranteed. This mandates very accurate and hence more expensive XOs at both transmitter and receiver sides. Alternatively, a lowcost, less accurate VCXO can be used to reduce the initial sample clock frequency offset. Correction of the residual offset is then performed in the digital domain 1. 5.4.3 Error correction in both time and frequency domains Figure 5.9 depicts the time error correction based on both interpolation filter in time domain and spectrum rotation in frequency domain 13. Dv  st  tD svk Dk  vs  kS   kS    Report on Question 162 181  Figure 5.9    Timing correction in discrete time and frequency domains  Skip FFTADCXORotorInterpolationFilter    An interpolator filter is used to correct the error increment vT  in a similar manner to Figure 5.7 and skipping corrector realizes step timing error elimination as shown in Figure 5.8. Finally, the rotor provides spectrum phase rotation to obtain the desired accuracy of the timing error in accordance with Figure 5.8. The main advantage of this method is that the interpolator has to correct only for small timing errors. For example, for the frequency offset of 100 ppm and code N  256, the interpolator has to correct a maximal timing error of 2.56  102 samples. A disadvantage of the presented technique is that it exploits the delayrotor property, which is only valid under specific conditions. 5.5 Network synchronization 5.5.1 Synchronization of telephone exchanges in the PSTN Initially PCM digital transmission systems were introduced with their own synchronization subsystems intended for their equipment internal needs Figure 5.4a. Figure 5.4b pertains to the situation where the digital exchange was appearing in the master network node. As digital centres were deployed, the problem of synchronous working appeared for effectivecost interaction. According to a pragmatic approach, the same clock frequency is required in the output and input tributary channels in the master node. So, the internal clock of the slave node PCM equipment must be locked to the internal clock frequency f0 of the master node PCM equipment. Moreover, both clocks are to be used as synchronizing signal sources for the cooperating digital equipment in corresponding nodes. As shown in Figure 5.4c, since the digital exchange is introduced into all nodes of existing telephone networks, then a reference clock for all equipment in each switching office is used so that PCM equipment internal clocks are locked to this reference clock also. With this comes the problem with a reference clock frequency being delivered to geographically spaced switching nodes. Synchronization network planning is solving this and we may view the ATT Switched Network Synchronization system realized during 1980s as the classical example in this regard. The heart of ATTs synchronization network is a caesium clock ensemble known as BSRF located in the country heaviness centre. The reference frequency from BSRF is distributed via analogue radio and coaxial systems to the 4ESS digital switching offices as shown in Figure 5.10 9. Such a refined but costly distribution network requires additional expenses for skilled maintenance, so the needs for a synchronization network should be explained. Dv  st  tD svk Dk  vs  vs   kS   kS  vT  182  Report on Question 162 In a digital switching office, the clock system controls timing of the thousands of message trunks. Intermediate buffers are necessary for absorbing the time jitter and wander which are arising in transmission systems, and for the frame alignment necessary for error free timedivision switching. The network contains a great number of interacting clocks and requires reliable frequency control of all clock sources within a limited range of permitted accuracy for acceptable service quality. Here intermediate buffer memories are being emptiedoverflowed if the rate of incoming bit stream runs slowlyquickly with respect to that of the local clock. As a result, stored data is being either read twice or lost. This is the reason why such a bit repetition or delay is called a slip. To avoid this effect, buffer control is implemented for 8bit word slips only in E1 digital signals so that a mean rate of the slips is considered as an important performance characteristic of the network quality. It is obvious that this mean is tended to be as low as possible based on the following effects  the introduction of the more rigid tolerance for the network clock frequency accuracy leads to relatively small buffers memory size,  reducing requirements for the network clock frequency accuracy leads to a rise in buffers memory size.  Figure 5.10    ATT Reference clock distribution                  Buffer memory size rises result in a proportional increase in the transmission delay through the network, and this important network quality performance factor should be limited. Delay accumulation in various services leads to performance violations, in telephony for instance, a delay of more than 100ms causes problems with echo suppression. Paper 10 addresses the necessary recommendations for works provision with respect to the timing accuracy improvement of the network clocks Table 5.1. Distribution Location 4ESS BSRF   Report on Question 162 183  Table 5.1    Synchronization objectives and references    5.5.2 Dynamics of the ITUT activity in synchronization aspects of communications In the past, timing aspects of the PSTN have been regarded as a subject for specialists in the field, and have not been normally considered as a part of general telecommunications training. After the introduction of SDH, the basic starting points of time and frequency have been reconsidered and reduced into the formulas recommended to avoid problems for network operators. Extensive network growth from 1993 to 2000 the number of Central Offices has doubled and the creation of new correspondent technologies SDHSONET, ATM etc. based on the use of enhanced services credit cards, 800 services etc. requires a troublefree deployment of the new network technologies. Synchronization is a necessary condition for network operation and management with high service quality at low cost. The dynamics of international standardization body activities in the field of network synchronization reflects the network technology development. Note, the ATT experience Figure 5.10 was embodied into three CCITT Recommendations of Blue Book 1988 G.810 Timing and synchronization considerations G.811 Timing requirement at the outputs of primary reference clocks suitable for plesiochronous operation of international digital links G.812 Timing requirements at the outputs of slave clocks suitable for plesiochronous operation of international digital links. Plesiochronous operation is a good decision for international interfaces. It helps to avoid the delicate problem of who should synchronize to whom at the level of a border gateway. With plesiochronous operation, we nominally get the same rate in any node but without adjustments. Figure 5.11 depicts a typical synchronization chain corresponding to the Recommendations and requirements for timing characteristics of node clocks Table 5.2.

Instead of accuracy, the performance for the holdover operation mode of the slave clock is determined. Holdover operation is started as soon as the reference signal is not available lost. This means that a slave clock output no longer reflects an external reference. Generally, in the holdover mode of operation, the clock output control is based on stored data acquired while holdin lock operation. Prediction of a slave clock frequency behaviour in time is most helpful here. It is based mainly on Kalman filter usage in PLLs and gives good results for hours or days. The modern modulation approach for crystalbased clocks 11 obtains good results for days, months, and years, and is now under development. Correspondent Recommendations characterize the performances of node clocks at each level. In the particular case, the G.811 1188 Recommendation sets limits for long term PRC accuracy with respect to UTC at the 1  1011 level which the USAs commercial caesium clocks exhibited in 1988. Note  synchronization distribution facilities Figure 5.11 have only been treated in isolated ways. Characterization of the links connecting node clocks requires a preliminary analysis of their proportions and correspondent efforts are now under consideration. Finally, to arrive at overall estimates of synchronization network performance, the standard definitions and measures for distribution links are given, which are easily combined with that for the clock. Synchronization of the PSTN ensures that all digital exchanges were ultimately slaved to the same master clock see Figure 5.10. Nevertheless, in reality network operation is stressed when slave clocks receive a synchronizing signal from a PRC over a facility that has impairments. Accumulation of the facilitycaused errors results in an inaccuracy increase of PRC frequency from 1012 to 1010 9, 12. Therefore, the clock distribution contributes a much larger portion of timing errors in a network than the clocks will, and such performance degradations are not acceptable for advanced transport network based on SONETSDH technology.

It is related to the partly distributed PRC synchronization network 13 Figure 5.12. 186  Report on Question 162  Figure 5.12    PRC synchronization        New clock distribution means are used for new planning. Namely, the best quality PRC signal is accessible worldwide due to GPSGLONASS, a spacebased radio positioning utility 14. Instead of a single PRC, sixteen PRCs with RubidiumGPS technology are distributed by an alldigital SONET transport network in which timedivision transmission and switching functions are critical. Low cost, simple and reliable clocks to be equipped by the compact GPS receiver that satisfy the PRC requirements providing a frequency accuracy up to 3  1012 one day average and a time accuracy of  150 ns with respect to GPS time 15. The network of partly distributed PRC with CPS receivers to provide a longterm timing accuracy to nodes, is richly interconnected and has a good capability of verification at several levels to detect and resolve timing degradation before it impacts service. This has been taken as the background for modern ITUT Recommendations such as G.803 0697 Architecture of transport networks based on the synchronous digital hierarchy SDH  Section 8 Architecture of synchronization networks G.810 0896 Definitions and terminology for synchronization network G.811 0997 Timing characteristics of primary reference clock SSU PRC PRC PRC PRCPRCPRCPRCPRCPRC PRC PRC PRC    Report on Question 162 187 G.812 0997 Timing requirements of slave clocks suitable for use in node clocks in synchronization networks G.813 0896 Timing characteristics of SDH equipment slave clocks SEC G.871 0299 Synchronization Layer Functions.

In contrast with the PSTN, only one type of G.812 slave clock is shown because the difference in holdover performance of the TNC and LNC is not relevant for SDH network synchronization. For simplification, the reference chain in Figure 5.13 does not exhibit the distribution facility of the synchronization signal. Before now, practical measurements have not been done to verify this ideal reference model. The influence of time jitter and wander, affected by the transport network, have not been considered yet in this reference connection. Nevertheless, clock noise here is negligible in comparison with that of the transmission line as the length of the reverence chain may be shortened in practice.  So, the new trends in network synchronization are based on distributed PRCs with shorter synchronization chains. The slave clocks have more than one input for the reference signals received from different PRCs. For reliable and stable operation of such synchronization networks, perfect network management is required. The ITUT Recommendation G.781 contains a detailed description of synchronization trails organization with correspondent Quality Levels of synchronization signals. For example, Option I of SDH synchronization networking for 2 048 kbits hierarchy has 4 levels of synchronization quality Table 5.3.  Table 5.3    Synchronization quality levels    The ITUT Recommendation G.812 deals with three main types of SSU Type I is for 2 048 kbits networking the wander generation and bandwith of Type I clocks are limited to the deployment in the reference synchronization chain in Figure 5.13 Type II is for distribution hubs  1 544 kbits networking Type III is for end offices  1 544 kbits networking.  Moreover, the ITUT Recommendation G.812 includes three additional types of SSU for existing networks Type IV must be complied with G.813, Option II 1 544 kbits networking Type V equals TNC of G.812 1188 Type VI equals LNC of G.812 1188.

An ATM network must handle any traffic type including those which are inherently timing dependent. So the synchronization of the network is one of the most important issues in the design of the ATM network. There are some traffic types that require synchronization between source and destination such as 17  Constantbitrate CBR services  Voice including compressed  Video including compressed  Multimedia. Only ATM networks that are not based on these service types data networks with variablebitrate VBR, for instance have no need for synchronization.  5.7 References 1 POLLET, Th. and PEETERS M. 1999 Synchronization with DMT Modulation.

These techniques are a combination of pulse code modulation and time division multiplex transmission and, like FDM carrier techniques, permit utilisation of a single transmission circuit for more than one telephone channel. The basic principle of PCM transmission involves the periodic sampling of voicefrequency signals. The sampling frequency is plesiochronous, i.e. a nominal rate with a permissible deviation from this rate. The analogue amplitude obtained at each sampling instant is converted into a number of digital pulses arranged within one time slot. The signal transmitted to line consists of a series of such time slots which, at the receiving terminal, are reconverted into a series of analogue signals, permitting the reconstruction of the speech information in analogue form. The speech time slots are arranged in frames containing time slots for frame synchronization and signalling. PCM line signals consist of digital pulses, which can be regenerated by relatively simple digital repeaters placed at regular intervals. Signalto noise ratio, attenuation and distortion are almost independent of the number of repeaters. Limitations occur due to accumulated jitter. The less stringent demands on the quality of the transmission medium are gained at the cost of increased bandwidth requirements. The PCM codingdecoding process, where an infinite number of amplitudes are represented by a finite number of quantified samples leads to quantization noise, which can be reduced by nonlinear coding methods. Among the advantages of digital transmission is the capability of encompassing all types of signals which are represented in digital form e.g. speech, data, sound and video. 6.1.2 Standards ITU has defined PCM  and Digital Multiplexers in its GSeries of Recommendations. Some of the more important Recommendations are listed below with abbreviated titles  Digital Hierarchy bit rates G.702  Characteristics of digital interfaces G.703  Principal characteristics of multiplex equipment G.731G.755. Three multiplex hierarchies exist worldwide, differing in bit rates, frame format and coding methods, see Table 6.1.   Report on Question 162 193  Table 6.1    PDH levels    The Recommendations describe the functions of the equipment, but not implementation details. Some of the essential functions are  Sampling The amplitude of the 4 kHz bandwidth analogue signal is measured sampled 8000 times per second. Quantization and Coding Each sample is represented by an 8 bit code permitting 256 code words which represent 256 analogue signal levels. Channel Each telephone channel is represented by 8 bit words repeated 8000 times per second leading to a bit rate of 64 kbits. Framing The timeslots representing various channels are multiplexed together forming a frame, which is identified by a frame alignment word. In addition frames can contain signalling and management information. Management The management bits in frames lead to defined actions and consequent signals, simplifying the identification of the source and location of faults.  6.1.3 Implementation Figure 6.1 illustrates plesiochronous transmission from a pcm multiplexer to an exchange using digital multiplexers and digital line systems. Each digital multiplexer has its own timing source. Due to bit interleaving at each multiplexer level the 8 bit byte structure of each channel is only accessible at the end points of the connection. The different multiplexer timing sources make it impossible to retrieve a particular channel time slot from a higher order frame without additional multiplexing  demultiplexing equipment. In addition each plesiochronous frame provides very little overhead information which would be required for efficient network management. In spite of the earlier described PDH advantages compared to analogue transmission, plesiochronous transmission is not appropriate for future integrated networks. Plesiochronous systems are used e.g.  in rural areas with overhead pair cables, multiplex levels 1 and 2s  inlocal areas for connection of radio stations multiplex levels 1 and 2  in long distance network with coaxial and fibre cables multiplex levels 3, 4 and 5.

SDH extends the principles of PDH by defining new administrative levels derived by direct byte interleaving, leading to a number of advantages  Digital 64 kbits channels or groups of channels can be added to or extracted directly from SDH signals leading to economic ADDDROP equipment.  Plesiochronous signals of different levels and belonging to different hierarchies e.g. CEPT, ANSI can be mapped to SDH and transmitted over SDH signals.   Digital channels belonging to different levels can be switched in Synchronous Digital Cross Connect equipment DXC.  The routing in DXC networks can be command controlled permitting, in a flexible way, different logical network configurations at different times.   Report on Question 162 195  DXCs permit sorting e.g. the separation of data, voice and video signals and packing economic utilisation of the transmission media of the transmitted information.  Last but not least, SDH and DXC equipment has been designed for network management based on the principles of Telecommunication Management Networks TMN. SDH signals are transmitted in the form of Synchronous Transport Modules STM. The module STM1, as shown in Figure 6.2, contains 2349 data bytes STM payload and 81 overhead bytes STM OH which are transmitted 8000 times per second, leading to the transmission bit rate 155.520 Mbits. Higher transmission rates 155.52  N are achieved with the synchronous transport modules STMN with SDH levels N  4, 16 and 64. The STM payload contains information according to the SDH multiplexing scheme illustrated in Figure 6.3. Plesiochronous signals are converted mapped to synchronous signals, they are inserted in Virtual Containers VC, multiplexed and transmitted as Synchronous Transport Modules STM across a digital line. VCs and STMs contain in addition, ample overhead information for the management and phase alignment of the digital signals in the various multiplexing stages.

The Synchronous Optical Network SONET is based on 52 Mbits USA standard, which can be multiplexed to STM1. 196  Report on Question 162 Table 6.2 below shows SDH levels, related bitrates and number of 64 kbits channels  Table 6.2    SDH levels    Figure 6.3 shows the worldwide accepted multiplexing schemes and Figure 6.4 illustrates a multiplexing example based on this scheme. A plesiochronous 2 Mbits tributary signal is mapped into a synchronous Container C12 with the addition of justification bits for frequency adaptation. After addition of Path Overhead information VC12 POH for path management the Virtual Container VC12 is obtained. The phase difference between VC12 and Tributary Units TU is indicated by a Tributary Unit Pointer, after addition of the pointer the Tributary Unit TU12 is obtained pointer processing. In the first multiplexing stage three TU12s are inserted into one Tributary Unit Group TUG2. The second multiplexing stage combines 7 TUG2s and Path Overhead information VC3 POH in the Virtual Container VC3. After addition of pointer information for phase alignment the Administrative Unit AU3 is obtained pointer processing. The third multiplexing stage multiplexes 3 AU3s to the Administrative Unit Group AUG. Finally in the forth multiplexing stage N AUGs are byte interleaved. STMN is obtained after addition of Repeater Section Overhead RSOH for the management of repeater sections and Multiplex Section Overhead MSOH for the management of multiplex sections.  In such a way a STM1 can transmit 3  7  3  63 2 Mbits tributaries or 3  34 Mbits tributaries or one 140 Mbits tributary.

The SDH terminals are equipped with Multiplex Section Protection for the protection of pointtopoint connections. Multiplex Section Shared Protection Rings MSSP, consisting of 2 bidirectional rings connected to AddDrop multiplexers, offer efficient protection against node or ring failures. 6.2.3 Implementation SDH networks contain SDH Multiplexers Terminal and ADDDROP Multiplexers, Digital Cross Connects with different cross connect levels and Digital Line Systems using coaxial or fibre cables.

Type II for conversion between various STM signals. A number of STM1 signals can be multiplexed to a higher bit rate to use fibre optic cables more efficiently. Type III for dropinsert of plesiochronous and synchronous signals to STMN. Single channels or groups of channels can be added or dropped from a synchronous bit flow, e.g. for AddDrop multiplexers in ring configurations. Type IV for interworking between AU4 CEPT and AU3 ANSI. Interworking between different hierarchies e.g. if CEPT related SDH signals have to be transmitted across ANSI facilities and vice versa. Types I and II permit flexible channel assignment, which corresponds to a limited cross connect functionality. Digital Cross Connect equipments permit the switching of various synchronous and, after mapping, plesiochronous tributaries which enter and exit the DXC at the port level. The level which is used for the switching cross connect level is equal or less than the port level. Typical port levels are 2, 34, 140 Mbits and STM1 signals. Typical cross connect levels are VC12, VC3, VC4.   Report on Question 162 199  Figure 6.6    SDH multiplexer types   Plesiochr.

A typical configuration is shown in Figure 6.7. The network in the example consists of 3 network layers national, regional and local network layers using mainly ring configurations in each layer. The reasons behind this network structure are  the flexibility of DXCs increases the degree of utilisation and simplifies planning, e.g. connections between customers in different access network parts use the regional layer and the national layer for the establishment of the connection  MSSP rings, and the use of 2 node connections between 2 adjacent rings, offer a very high level of reliability  the simple network structure is suitable for TMN, which simplifies operation, administration, and maintenance, decreasing management costs.

The bottomup strategy in which SDH is first introduced in the local network forming SDH islands, e.g. for local customers requiring high speed data interconnection.  The overlay strategy which leads to separate SDH networks, e.g. for distributed customers requiring improved quality and data rates compared with existing networks.   Report on Question 162 201 6.3 Dense Wavelength Division Multiplex WDM 6.3.1 Principles The continuous demand for increased bandwidth at reasonable cost, together with the evolution of fibres and fibre optical components, led to the renascence of frequency division systems FDM. However, as the copperbound FDM systems could only transmit about 10000 analogue telephone channels, high density wavelength division multiplex systems DWDM on fibres will be able to transmit about 30 Million digital telephone channels or a corresponding number of broadband channels. Figure 6.8 illustrates the evolution of fibre optical transmission systems. In the early 1970s systems with light emitting diode transmitters LED using multimode fibres in the 1.3 m band and 10 km repeater distances could transmit up to about 300 Mbits. During the late 1980s systems with Laser transmitters using singlemode fibres in the 1.55 m band and 100 km repeater distances could transmit up to about 2500 Mbits. The late 1990s systems with parallel working, narrowband lasers at different frequencies and Erbiumdoped fibre amplifiers using singlemode fibres in the 1.55 m band and 120 km amplifier distances will transmit up to about 2500 Gbits. However, the total distance between DWDM terminals will be limited to about 600 km.

Some Recommendations with abbreviated titles are shown below  Optical line systems with optical amplifiers and optical multiplexing G.681.  Optical interfaces for multichannel systems with optical amplifiers G.692.  Structures and mapping for the optical transport network G.709.  Functional characteristics of optical networking equipment G.798.  Framework for optical networking Recommendations  Architecture, Requirements and Management G.871, 872, 873, 874, 875. The Recommendations describe  frequency allocations,  access and line interfaces,  management functions. Figure 6.9 shows the recommended ITU wavelength grid, permitting up to 43 optical frequencies in the 1.55 m window. An additional frequency is employed as Optical Supervisory Channel OSC. Figure 6.10 shows as an example an OSC arranged at 1.51 m, i.e. outside the frequency band of the payload channels. The OSC can carry a 2 Mbits framed signal permitting it to transmit ample management information e.g. optical section trace and status, laser output power control, data communication channels and engineering orderwire. DWDM Advantages DWDM Disadvantages DWDM offers high transmission rates on fibre pairs, the capacity can be increased without laying new cables as existing cables can be used. The transmission capacity can be increased in a modular manner by adding additional wavelengths as and when capacity increases are required. DWDM systems are transparent, i.e. different wavelengths can carry different data at different data rates. Twoway DWDM transmission is possible across a single fibre. Due to imperfections in the present optical amplifiers the number of amplifiers and the total distance between DWDM terminals is limited. DWDM systems offer less monitoring and management capabilities compared with time division multiplex systems.

Incoming optical tributaries at the Single Channel Interface SCI normally have unspecified wavelengths generated in ElectricalOptical Converters. They are converted to standardized wavelengths in a send transponder TP, multiplexed in a fibre coupler assembly and transmitted via an optical send amplifier SA to the Main Path Interface MPI. In the receive direction incoming line signals are amplified in an optical receive amplifier RA and demultiplexed in discrete wavelength filters, e.g. in planararray waveguides. Receive transponders RTP are required if 1.55 m signals are not suitable for the subsequent converters. In addition to the adddrop frequencies other frequencies can pass through the OADM. The adddrop function of OSC is not shown in the Figure.  Figure 6.11    Optical adddrop multiplexerdemultiplexer example   Optical AddDrop MUXDEMUX          Elect.Opt.

The Pointto Point network consists of Optical Terminal MultiplexersDemultiplexers OTM and Optical Line Amplifiers OLA. For management the OSC is connected via a Control Unit CON and a Q3 management interface to a Work Station WS. With Optical AddDrop MultiplexersDemultiplexers OADM Optical PointtoPoint protection networks are feasible. The switchover from working to protection section is initiated by signal detection and activated by OSC functions.   Report on Question 162 205 A number of OADMs can be arranged in rings, offering flexible network and traffic configurations. In the case of node or line faults rerouting in the ring can be activated by OSC functions. In the example the traffic between the nodes A  B, A  C and C  D uses the frequency 1, and the traffic between nodes A  D is based on the frequency 2. A fault between nodes A and C results in rerouting via nodes B and D.

ATM signals can be carried by SDH transmission and SDH signals can be carried by DWDM transmission. As illustrated in Figure 6.14 the combination of these technologies permits a variety of different protection and routing schemes. The example shows DWDM and SDH protection which cooperates with the rerouting facilities of ATM nodes, e.g. controlled by a network management system. In the case of Internet connections additional routing is possible using Internet routing protocols. Proper choice of protection mechanisms is necessary to guarantee the high performance requirements of existing and new services.

Historically these connections, subscriber loops, consist of twisted copper pairs assembled in cables. Figure 6.15 shows an example of telephone loop plant with feeder cables to concentrated customer areas, distribution cables to potential customer sites and drop wires to customer premise. Subscriber loops have been under study for many years and different models exist to describe important parameters such as  cable type wire diameter, isolation material  cable length  loop structure load coils, bridged taps  noise sources cross talk, impulse noise, radio frequency interference.   Report on Question 162 207  Figure 6.15    Example of telephone loop plant                                                               For analogue voice frequency signals, it is normally the attenuation, based on the wire gauge, determines the length of a subscriber loop. Loading coils are used in some cases to extend the range. For digital signals with bandwidths exceeding voice frequencies it is normally attenuation, crosstalk and phase delay which limit subscriber loop lengths. In addition impulse noise can influence the range. The introduction of new services demanding digital signals with higher and higher bit rates made it necessary to either extend the usable bandwidth of existing subscriber loops with sophisticated technologies, or to replace the twisted pairs with broadband transmission media such as fibrecoaxial cables or wireless transmission. The extensive cost involved in replacing the existing subscriber loops, together with developments in the field of digital signal processing, led to the development of new technologies for better utilization of the available bandwidth such as  baseband modems  voice band modems  digital subscriber lines xDSL. About 15 of existing subscriber loops require upgrade activities to be suitable for xDSL techniques. Corrective measures include the introduction of midspan repeaters and the removal of load coils, and in certain cases the removal of bridged taps. Simultaneous transmission of voice frequency signals and higher frequency signals, in the same or opposite directions, can require splitter installation as illustrated in Figure 6.16. Nearend crosstalk NEXT is a major impairment for systems that share the same frequency band for upstream and downstream transmission. NEXT noise is seen by the receiver located at the same end of the cable as the transmitter which is the noise source. Farend crosstalk FEXT is the noise detected by the receiver located at the far end of the cable from the transmitter which is the noise source. FEXT is less severe than NEXT because the FEXT noise is attenuated by traversing the full length of the cable. Central Office Customer Terminal Feeder Cable Distribution CableDrop wire 208  Report on Question 162  Figure 6.16    Example of splitter installation                           Splitter filter configurations make it possible to isolate POTS and DSL applications. Splitters decrease the influence of onoff hook related impedance changes, pulse, ringing and crosstalk disturbances. Nearend crosstalk has to be attenuated as a DSL transmitter sends with about 100 mW and a telephone receiver works with 0.1 mW. The usable spectrum of the twisted pair can be extended from the voice frequency signals of up to 4 kHz, to over 500 kHz for the transmission of digital signals using xDSL technologies. With powerful digital signal processing it is possible to use sophisticated coding methods which mitigate crosstalk. Together with channel equalization and echo cancellation techniques bit rates in the range of Mbits can be transmitted across existing physical subscriber loops. Subscriber Line Systems are designed with a 6 dB signal to noise margin to secure a bit error rate better than 10 exp  7. The design margin provides e.g. for cable variations and noise impairment and is a trade of between reliable operation and transmission across the longest possible loop. 6.4.2 Subscriber Line Systems Voice band modems were introduced in the late 1950s to transmit data in the voice frequency band from 200 Hz to 3400 kHz. More and more bandwidth efficient modems were developed, in late 1996 the technological limit for modems were achieved with the standardization of the ITU V.90 modems offering up to 56 kbits transmission across a dialup telephone connection with a bandwidth efficiency of about 14 bitss per Hz.

Loop Filter Terminal   Report on Question 162 209 Table 6.5 below relates the existing and new technologies to access bit rates and applications   Table 6.5    Subscriber line technologies    The concept of ISDN as conceived in 1976 offers a Basic Rate access of two B channels 2  64 kbits, one D channel 16 kbits and additional 16 kbits for management functions, resulting in a duplex transmission capacity of 160 kbits. Data is sent in both directions simultaneously with echocancelled transmission. With 2B1Q baseband transmission techniques a bandwidth of 80 kHz is required. The resulting bandwidth efficiency is 2 bits per Hz. Based on ISDN designs during 1992 the first HDSL systems were put into service. HDSL provides twoway 1.544 or 2.048 Mbits transmission over twisted pair subscriber loops up to 3.7 km. Echocancelled hybrid duplex 2B1Q transmission is normally used. HDSL systems use two pairs of wires, with each pair conveying half of the payload in both directions dualduplex transmission. In addition singleduplex and dualsimplex transmission modes are possible. SDSL provides the same bandwidth upstream as downstream using one pair. The price paid for maintaining bandwidth symmetry is lower aggregate bandwidth. Data rates from 384 kbits up to 2 Mbits are possible. In many applications a higher downstream rate from the central office end to the remote terminal end compared to the upstream data rate is required. ADSL is a loop transmission technology that simultaneously transports the following via one pair of wires up to about 5 km  Downstream towards the customer bit rates up to about 9 Mbits  Upstream toward the network bit rates up to 1 Mbits  Plain old telephone service.

Due to the high bandwidth efficiency of about 15 bits per Hz and the simple installation, ADSL systems are expected to be used in large quantities on existing subscriber loops. VDSL is an extension of xDSL technology to higher bit rates, up to 52 Mbits downstream and up to 13 Mbits upstream over short distances the details are still being evaluated within ITUT SG15. Figure 6.17 shows the general structure of a 2B1Q DSL transceiver. The incoming data flow from the user terminal is scrambled, to avoid long streams of zeros or ones, every bit pair is encoded into a 2B1Q symbol, thus the symbol rate is half of the bit rate. Two binary signals are converted in one 4level signal. The symbols are converted to the line code and after filtering sent to the hybrid circuit and subscriber loop. The incoming line signals are filtered to minimize the outofband noise, amplified and regenerated in the analoguedigital converter with the aid of timing signals. The send side 2B1Q symbols are sent to the echo canceller, which models the equivalence of the echo path. Send and receive clocks are synchronized to obtain a stable echo path transfer function. The digitized and echo cancelled received signal is further filtered by the decision feedback circuit and sent to the decision device, which is a four  level threshold detector. After converting to binary signals and descrambling the received information is sent to the user terminal.

In addition to the versions shown in Figure 6.19, ADSL Lite and Full Rate ADSL can use echo cancellation, i.e. the frequency band 4138 kHz is used for both upstream and downstream transmission. ADSL Lite is expected to replace voice band modems for internet access and will be used in considerable quantities if the following can be achieved  Easy enduser installation without splitters and visit by service personnel  Long transmission distance  Flexible data rates up to 1.5 Mbits for users  Interoperability and compatibility with Fullrate ADSL. The requirements for easy installation make splitterless installation an important provision for ADSL Lite. However, in certain cases ADSL Lite demands splitters or additional filters to protect the telephone sets as illustrated in Figure 6.20.

HDSL offers however a number of advantages, such as  lower bandwidth requirements  lower crosstalk into other systems  better diagnostics due to ample overhead, giving reduced maintenance cost  operation over 95 of HDSL lines without midspan repeater  typical error rates better than 109. HDSL systems can work in different modes Dual Duplex 1.544 HDSL systems operate on two pairs of wires,  each pair conveying 768 kbits payload and 16 kbits Embedded Operation Channel EOC in both directions. 2 048 HDSL systems operate on 2 or 3 pairs. The echocancelled hybrid transmission normally uses the 2B1Q line code. Single Duplex Systems also called SDSL operate on one single pair, the two transmission directions are separated either by frequency division multiplexing or echocancellation. However due to the wide frequency spectrum required only a limited ranges is possible. Dual Simplex Systems use two pairs with one pair carrying the full payload in one direction and the other pair the full payload in the opposite direction.  Figure 6.23 shows a simplified HDSL Reference Model. A fully equipped HDSL transceiver transmits over one pair at 2320 kbits, over 2 pairs at 1168 kbits per pair, or over 2 or 3 pairs at 784 kbits per pair. The transceivers are connected via Digital Local Lines DLL or connected to Regenerators REG. The Network Termination Unit NTU acts as the master to the slave Line Termination Unit LTU.

The bit stream from the customer side enters the NTU over the Application Interface and is grouped at the Interface in Application Frames. For 2.048 Mbits applications the Application Frames are mapped into 144 byte Core Frames. The Core frame information is multiplexed with alignment bits, maintenance and overhead bits in order to obtain HDSL Frames which are then transmitted via Digital Local Lines using 2B1Q line codes. At the receiving side, data within the received HDSL frames is demultiplexed to obtain again the Core Frames. Core Frames are passed to the mapping function to restore the Application Frame and transmitted to the Application Interface at the network side.

VDSL can support voice, data and video simultaneously in addition to future applications such as high definition Television and highperformance computing. VDSL downstream rates are up to 52 Mbits and upstream data rates up to 13 Mbits. Such high data rates can only be transmitted over short distances. It is anticipated that the evolution of the existing telephone line plant will bring more fibre links to replace the physical subscriber loops and that the remaining subscriber loops will be in the range of 1 km. This distance is suitable for VDSL systems. Figure 6.25 shows the reference model of a VDSLbased broadband transmission system. VDSL systems are normally connected to optical access networks, e.g. Fibre to the Curb installations. VDSL loops are terminated in VDSL Terminal Units, VTUC at the network side and VTUR at the remote user side. VTUC can be located in the Optical Network Unit ONU which terminates the Optical Distribution Network ODN. With service splitters PSTN or ISDN signals can be separated from the VDSL signals.  The information transfer is organized in VDSL frames containing payload and separate upstream and downstream error control mechanisms. The line codes can be QAM 8 bits per symbol or CAP leading to the parameters shown in Table 6.7 below I N T E R F A C E Mapping MaintCommon Circuitry Maint.HDSL transceiver   Maint.

The Optical Distribution Network ODN is located between the Optical Line Termination OLT and the Optical Network Unit ONU, which also contains the VTUC. The VDSL link is terminated in the Network Termination NT, which also contains the VTUR. For management purposes, an Operation System OS is connected via the Q3 management interface to the OLT. The management of the ATM links is divided between the ATM layer F4 and F5 and the Physical layer F1, F2, F3. Management information related to the VDSL link contained in VDSL Embedded Operation Channel is transported to the OS via ATM.

At this stage there is little consensus regarding which network architecture is most suitable to support xDSL as an access technology. For the time being ADSL is considered to satisfy the majority of applications, as 6 to 8 Mbits can be transmitted to customer installations on most existing subscriber loops. Figure 6.27 illustrates an example the transport of Internet Protocol IP traffic. According to specifications of the ADSL Forum, IP packets can be transported directly over ADSL links without the need for additional protocols. In addition to the corporate application shown in the Figure, IP can be used for residential applications with Personal Computers PC connected to the ADSL remote side. Access to the IP network can be established via a PointtoPoint Protocol PPP over an ADSL connection.

However, ATM applications operating at data rates below 25 Mbits via multiple ADSL links results in a rather extensive overhead. In the case of 155 Mbits, connection over fibre is preferable.

Cooperation with ETSI took care of specific European requirements. In 1997 the ITUT began defining a series of Recommendations for DSL systems and at present year 2000 Recommendations have been elaborated by Study Group 15 dealing with functions, management, handshaking and test principles for ADSL, HDSL and VDSL systems. A study of the xDSL related Recommendations of the G.99x Series reveals the complexity of the DSL systems, nearly 1000 pages are required to define the systems The family of G.99x Recommendations include G.991.1 High bitrate Digital Subscriber Line HDSL Transceivers. G.992.1 Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line ADSL Transceivers. G.992.2 Splitterless Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line ADSL Transceivers. G.994.1 Handshake Procedures for Digital Subscriber Line DSL. G.995.1 Overview of Digital Subscriber Line DSL Recommendations. G.996.1 Test Procedures for Digital Subscriber Line DSL Transceivers. G.997.1 Physical Layer Management for Digital Subscriber Line DSL Transceivers. In addition to these Recommendations Study Group 13, under the concept of the Global Information Infrastructure GII, has developed several general Recommendations, e.g. Rec. Y.120 containing scenarios which include xDSL technology. 6.4.8 Outlook ADSL is regarded as the basic DSL service option for the residential market. As an ADSL system offers fast downstream and slower upstream data rates, it is ideal for Internet access. Competitive Local Exchange Carriers CLECs consider the availability of ADSL as an ideal opportunity to get into the data market quickly and compete with the incumbent carriers. To deploy ADSL, however, Line cards or Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexors DSLAM would have to be installed near to central office belonging to the incumbent carriers. In addition, because of the quality of home networks and inpremises wiring, which impacts the maximum data rate and range of the transmission system, many situations are not appropriate to splitterless technologies. HDSL allows the provision of highspeed digital services over existing copper subscriber loops over 2 to 4 parallel pairs. For distances up to about 3 km HDSL is a quick and costeffective option for the deployment of duplex T1 or E1 systems. Extensive work is in progress to define a HDSL system using only one pair, called Next Generation HDSL HDSL2, or SHDSL. To achieve this goal the system performance and gain have to be increased and the effects of NEXT have to be mitigated with spectrum shaping. The investigations compare different line codes, filters and resulting transceiver complexity. HDSL2 may be about 8 times more complex than HDSL ADSL is likely to be an interim step towards VDSL, which will provide the extra bandwidth needed for full broadband services. The success of VDSL will depend on fibre being extended much closer to the customer, e.g. upgrading of feeder routes to fibre. 222  Report on Question 162 6.4.9 Literature 1 Reference book on xDSL, ITUD Study Group 2, Question 122, under preparation, 2000 2 Albin Johansson, ADSL Lite, The broadband enabler for the mass market, Ericsson Review No. 4, 1998. 3 Thomas Starr Understanding Digital Subscriber Line Technology, Communication Engineering and Emering Technologies Prentice Hall PTR, NJ 07458, 1999 4 Dr. Walter Y.

Communications evolved in history towards the concept of the asynchronous transfer mode. The motivations were very strong and, in order to understand them, a brief inspect of communications evolution is necessary.  Communications started in the nineteenth century with the invention of the telephone, capable of transmitting analogue voice signals. The users were connected via switches across the network to form a circuit. This type of switching is known as circuit switching and it provides a permanent allocation of channels or bandwidth between the connection end points. In analogue telephony the only way of sharing the common media was based on frequency division multiplex, which appeared in 1925. The first coaxial cables, installed in 1936, provided wide bandwidth and better performance concerning the signal to noise ratio.  Digital communications, which came in the late 1960s, was introduced simultaneously with the time division multiplexing. Soon after that a problem with the interconnection of computer systems over the communication networks arose. Modems, generating the analogue signals compatible with the public switched telephone network, were used. Data are transferred in bursts separated by silence intervals. This is why the constant connection provided by the circuit switching was not the optimal one. The solution to the problem was to split the data into discrete units, packets, and to send them individually across a network. Packets contain a considerable overhead involved in error recovery, redundancy enhancement and routing information. So packet switching has been developed.  Time division multiplexing, if used in switching, gives an opportunity for multirate switching where a station attaches to the network by a single physical link which carries multiple fixed data rate channels Bchannels  64 kbits. Traffic on each channel can be switched independently through the network. This principle has also been used in Integrated Services Digital Network ISDN. Though it offered a number of data rate choices, these are fixed and thus, not very efficient for variable bit rate VBR transmission.  The same byte organization, which enables multirate switching, is present in the synchronous digital hierarchy network SDH. It should be noted that SDH uses synchronous time division multiplexing. It provides means for controlling the network resources in order to deliver a guaranteed quality of service QoS, but at the expense of inefficient use of those resources. In order to accommodate different data rates in modern high speed communication networks, frame relay appeared as a promising solution. It is essentially identical to packet switching with the exception of the variable length packets, and is designed to operate at up to 2 Mbits. Packets in the frame relay systems include less overhead than in the previous systems. In the context of supporting VBR traffic, it has improved performance. Realtime applications such as voice or video tend not to be very bursty, producing the constant bit rate at the output. It is efficient to assign a fixed bandwidth to a single source. Available capacity is shared between such sources on an equalportion basis. 226  Report on Question 162 The tremendous need for delivering more data, especially for video applications resulted in various compression techniques. Consequently, the bit streams produced in many new applications are variable. By assuring variable bit rate VBR transmission, satisfactory quality of service can be obtained. For instance, less significant details in image or video transmission are compressed and the bandwidth saved for more important details. In case of VBR transmission, constant quality instead of constant rate may be produced, Figure 7.1.  Figure 7.1   Constant rate vs. constant quality, for a CBR transmission b VBR transmission   lost data  image degradation image quality data rate CBRVBRimage quality data rate time time time time a CBR transmission no data loss  constant image quality b VBR transmission     The introduction of new services at the end of 1980 required a new technology which could support multiple services, deliver the necessary highspeed transmission rates, allow for bandwidth ondemand and offer endtoend control for efficient management. So, traditional networks had to be specialized in order to meet these requirements. Various network types have been developed introducing specific interfaces, facilities and support requirements. With the development of optical fibre technology, a high speed transmission media with low susceptibility to noise was obtained. It enabled transmission of different types of broadband services consuming significant bandwidth. This was the initial power for the Broadband ISDN BISDN foundation.   Report on Question 162 227 Frame relay evolved to cell relay, using fixed sized packets of short length, cells. Having a low noise high speed transmission media, and higher layer network control, it provides minimum overhead for error control. Cell relay allows for the definition of virtual channels with data rates dynamically defined. So, cell relay can be viewed as a progression from circuit switching for constant bit rates, and packet switching for the variable bit rates.  To ensure that information is not lost, any signal should be transferred at the peak natural rate. As a consequence, at times of lower information rate for example in which redundancy was present in the original signal and thus coding techniques have saved bandwidth network resources are not be used efficiently. To resolve this, multiplexing of different signals has been proposed. ATM provides an efficiency gain through statistical multiplexing of dynamic user traffic. It allows multiple connections to share the outputport bandwidth, producing a high utilization of the available resources, see Figure 7.2. Having inputs with fluctuating bandwidth requirements that merge at one output queue, a statistical multiplexer output cell rate is less than the sum of the peak input cell rates. To avoid cell loss it is necessary to use a buffer for storing the excess queued cells. It was believed that appropriate buffering should decrease the burstiness peak to average cell ratio, smoothing the aggregate cell stream output of a statistical multiplexer. However, it has been shown that the aggregate stream is as bursty, as the inputs are. As a result, achieving a statistical multiplexing gain requires a much larger buffer at every contention point. Buffer dimensioning is the subject of a low delaylow cell error ratio compromise.  Figure 7.2    Statistical multiplexer vs. peak level based multiplexer  A B C unused banwidth multiplexing according to the peak level C B A statistical multiplexer     According to ITUT Recommendation I120, The main feature of the ISDN concept and thus the BISDN too is the support of a wide range of voice and nonvoice applications in the same network. A key element of service integration  is the provision of a range of services using a limited set of connection types and multipurpose usernetwork interface arrangements. The ATM is a transfer mode for implementing the BISDN. By the term transfer both the transmission and the switching of the information with reasonable delay and complexity are included. In order to explain the ATM properties, three different types of transfer mode are presented in Figure 7.3.  228  Report on Question 162 Today, the standard switching technique for narrow band signals which are mainly voice connections is by the switching of synchronous channels for the duration of the connection. The switching is realized by combinations of space and time switching stages in exchanges. In synchronous transfer mode STM each connection is periodically presented as a fixedlength word also named time slot, Figure 7.3 a.  Data applications use packets information blocks. In a packet transfer mode ITUT, I.113, the transmission and switching functions are achieved by packetoriented techniques by their address only, without any relation to time, so as to dynamically share resources among different connections, Figure 7.3 b. In the asynchronous transfer mode all information to be transferred is packetised into fixedsize slots called cells, and it operates in connectionoriented mode. These cells have a 48octet information field and a 5 octet header containing routing and control information. The transfer is asynchronous in the sense that the recurrence of cells containing the information from an individual user for a single service is not necessarily periodic, Figure 7.3 c.   Figure 7.3    Comparison between three various transfer modes  time slotframebitcelltttelementary unit time slot per frame  1 octet connection fixed time slot in each frameelementary unit bitconnection variable number of bits  packet, may start at any bit positionelementary unit cellconnection fixed number of bits  cell starting at fixed boundaries cell clockpacketSynchronous Transfer ModePacket Transfer ModeAsynchronous Transfer Modeheaderabc    The ATM technology is targeted at eliminating the duplication of hardware and software requirements. Thus, a single network should provide higher link efficiency, simplified operations, maintenance, services provisioning, reduced equipment costs and a flexible allocation of network resources.  The ATM uses the Asynchronous Time Division ATD principle in which a transmission capability is organized in nondedicated slots filled with labelled cells with respect to instantaneous need of each application. Each application source, as it may have a variable bit rate, defines its own transmission rate.    Report on Question 162 229 ATM complies with three basic requirements for future services Future services require high transmission rates, reaching more than 100 Mbits. They will be used for fast document transmission, fast processor connections or video transmissions. Many services need a variable transport capacity that can be defined for each connection individually. Depending on the traffic characteristic of the service, both continuous and packetised information may have to be transmitted. The third requirement follows the need for variable bit rates during the connection. Interactive services have phases with very high bit rates during the information transfer and phases with nearly no information flow during the information processing or view bursty traffic. Variable bit rate coding generates different bit rates during the connection. ATM cells can be transported on different transmission systems. The only requirement is that bit sequence independence is guaranteed, meaning that there are no restrictions on allowed cell information. The ITUT defined two options for the usernetwork interface, one based on the SDH, and the other on pure cell multiplexing.  The source signals are packetised in the terminal, or for conventional terminals in a separate terminal adapter, into ATMcells. In ATMsystems exchanges, multiplexers, concentrators cells of different connections are statistically multiplexed. Unused transmission capacity will be filled with empty cells. Figure 7.4 shows an example of the process how analogue signals are packed into cells and these cells are multiplexed with cells of other connections.

For example it takes 6 ms to fill one cell of a 64 kbits data stream. In the network, these cells are multiplexed with other cells and modified in the switching node. So, additional, rather than fixed delays appear. For services with constant bit streams, appropriate measures have to be provided.  230  Report on Question 162 Furthermore, cells can be lost because of bit error, buffer overflow or by the action of a policing function which supervises the cell stream for compliance with agreed parameters. A lost cell represents the loss of 48 bytes of information. The source coding has to cope with this kind of error. 7.2 Virtual connections  Virtual channel and virtual path The ATM is a connectionoriented technique with virtual connections between the termination points. Basic terms concerning virtual connections are defined in ITUT Recommendation I.311.  Virtual Channel  The virtual channel VC is a generic term used to describe a unidirectional communication capability for the transport of ATM cells. Any virtual channel obtains its identifier VCI in the process of connection establishment. The VCI is a part of a cell header.  Virtual Path The virtual path VP represents a concept used for describing the unidirectional transport of cells belonging to virtual channels associated by a common unique identifier VPI. It is also part of a cell header.  Figure 7.5    The relation between Virtual Paths and Virtual Channels  TransmissionPayloadVPIxVPIyVPIzVCIaVCIbVCIc    The parameters of a virtual connection will be defined in the setup phase of the connection. By use of a signalling procedure the Virtual Channel Identifier VCI and the Virtual Path Identifier VPI are requested from the local exchange. The exchanges check the availability of the requested resources and assign them if available. The Virtual Path and the Channel Identifiers VPI, VCI of the header define how the cells are routed through the network. Thus, cells belonging to the same virtual connection are recognized and cells belonging to other virtual connections can be distinguished. The values for VPI and VCI are only valid for the duration of the connection and are normally different for each link, because each switching node reprocesses them for the next link. However, they are always clearly assigned to this virtual connection. As ATM is a connectionoriented technique all cells of one connection take the same route. By this, they keep the same order and overtaking is not possible. Preserving the cell order is known as the cell sequence integrity principle ITUT, I.150.    Report on Question 162 231 The VPI defines bundles of virtual connections see Figure 7.5. Within the network, bundles of connections characterized by the same VPI can be handled together. A different application could be used in the future to distinguish different networksoperators. The subscriber could define, via the VPIaddress, which network he would like to use. In an ATM environment, a circuit or path does not have a fixed capacity. Virtual means that cells are routed from the source destination on the basis of the VPI in whatever way seems appropriate. All cells with the same VPI value belong to the same Virtual Path VP, and a VP can contain several virtual channels. So, a VC is a logical subdivision of the VP, and all cells having the same VPI and VCI belong to the same VC. A physical link containing VPs and VCs interconnects adjacent nodes however the concept of VP and VC has a wider meaning than just connections from one node to another. A VP can be extended over a number of nodes. The VPI value is just a local identifier corresponding to one section of a VP. Such a section is called a VP link. With the help of ATM switches a series of VP links can be connected to form a complete virtual path. Each Virtual Path can contain a number of Virtual Channels. Like the VP, the VC can be extended over a number of nodes. The section of a VC that resides within one VP is called a VC link. Connecting one VC link to another requires an ATM switch capable of switching on VClevel. Virtual Path and Virtual Channel connections can be set up dynamically on demand through procedures initiated by the enduser, and an operator can also setup virtual connections by use of a management system. An example of where paths and channels could be used, would be where a company with two offices could connect their computers and telephones by renting a virtual path. In this way the company is allocated a number of virtual channels. These VCs can be used for many different services, such as email, telephony, Internet access and file transfer. As ATM is a connectionoriented technique, virtual circuits are required to be established between the end nodes before transmission can start. So, the routing of cells is performed at every node for each arriving cell. The VPI 8 or 12bit field together with the VCI a 16bit field contain the routing information of a cell. In the routing process the VCI value of the incoming VC link is translated into the VCI value of the outgoing link.  A VP is a collection of VCs between two nodes in a BISDN. A predefined route is associated with each VP in the physical network. Furthermore, each VP has its own defined bandwidth, limiting the number of VCs that can be multiplexed on a VP. In general, VPIs are used to route packets between two nodes that originate, remove, or terminate the VPs, whereas VCIs are used at the end nodes to distinguish different connections.  7.3 ATM transport network layering  General concept According to ITUT Recommendation I.311, ATM transport network is structured into two layers, the ATM layer, and the Physical layer, see Figure 7.6. The transport functions of the ATM layer are subdivided into two levels the VC level and the VP level. The transport functions of the physical layer are subdivided into three levels, the transmission path level, the digital section level and the regenerator section level. The transport functions of the ATM Layer are independent of the physical layer implementation. The Connection endpoint is located at the level boundary e.g. between the VC level and the VP level where a client is served. The client may be located in the next higher level or in the management plane. The connection endpoint provides the connection termination function. The Connecting point is inside a connection where two adjacent links come together. It is located in a level where information is routed transparently. It provides the connecting function. 232  Report on Question 162  Figure 7.6    Hierarchical leveltolevel relationship in the ATM transport network  T181127190VirtualchannellevelVirtualpath levelVirtual channel linkVirtual path linkVirtual channel connectionVirtual path connectionATM LayerTransmissionpath levelDigitalsectionlevelRegeneratorsection levelTransmission pathDigital sectionRegenerator sectionPhysical LayerConnection endpoint of the corresponding levelsConnecting point of the corresponding levels     The Connection provides the capability of transferring information between endpoints. It represents the association between endpoints together with any additional information regarding the information transfer integrity. The Link provides the capability of transferring information transparently. A link represents the association between contiguous connecting points or between an endpoint and its contiguous connecting point.   Report on Question 162 233 As shown in Figure 7.6 and Figure 7.7, a transmission path may comprise several virtual paths each of them carrying several virtual channels. The relationship between different levels of the ATM transport network is obvious.  The Transmission path level extends between network elements that assemble and disassemble the payload of a transmission system. At the end of a transmission path it is necessary to provide the cell delineation as well as the header error control.  The Digital section level extends between the network elements that assemble and disassemble a continuous bit or byte stream.  The Regenerator section level extends between the network elements that perform signal regeneration. 7.4 ATM switching of VPS and VCS An ATM system permits packet switching. It uses small, equalsized packets, called cells, and a simple protocol which allows cells to be transmitted, interpreted and delivered quickly enough to carry any kind of information including voice and video. The high bit rates require fast hardware logic for the cell processing switching, multiplexing instead of software processing of cells which would require more time. The two main tasks for an ATM switching or crossconnect node are   the VPIVCI evaluation and recalculation, and  the transport of cells from input ports to the required output ports.  The switching of ATM cells is done according to a routing table. Concerning only the first switching task it can be concluded that there are two possible switching levels, the VC level and the VP level. Switching on VC level means that one incoming VC link is connected to one or more outgoing VC links. The translation is based on data in the routing table associating the incoming VPIVCI value to the outgoing port. Switching on the VP level means that the routing of cells is based on the VPI value only. Thus, all incoming cells with a certain VPI value are directed to a certain outgoing VP link. No attention is paid to the VCI. The value of the VCI remains the same.  VCI identifies a particular VC link for a given Virtual Path Connection VPC. A specific value of VCI is assigned each time a VC is switched in the network.  Routing functions of virtual channels are done at a VC switchcrossconnect. This routing involves translation of the VCI values of the incoming VC links into the VCI values of the outgoing VC links. Virtual channel links are concatenated to form a Virtual Channel Connection VCC. A VCC extends between two VCC endpoints or, in the case of pointtomultipoint arrangements, more than two VCC endpoints. A VCC endpoint is the point where the cell information field is exchanged between the ATM Layer and the user of the ATM layer service. 234  Report on Question 162  Figure 7.7    Representing of the VP and VC switching hierarchy ITUT, I.311  T181128090VCI 21VCI 22VCI 21VCI 22VPI 1VPI 4VCI 24VCI 21VCI 22VPI 2VPI 3VPI 5VCI21VCI22VCI23VCI24VPI1VPI3VPI2VCI 23VCI 21VCI 22VCI 23VCI 24VCI 25VCI 24VCI 23VCI 24VCI 25VCI 24VCI 21VCI 22VPI 1VPI 2VPI 3VPI 4VPI 5VPI 6Endpointof VPCa Representation of VC and VP switchingVC switchcrossconnectVP switchcrossconnectVP switchcrossconnectb  Representation of VP switching    7.5 ATM cell format The ATM system transports information in small packets, called cells, with  a fixed block length of 48 bytes octets for the information field, and  5 bytes octets for control information the cell header.   Report on Question 162 235 The advantages of the fixed size cells come from reduced queuing delay for high priority cells and efficient switching. Both of these advantages are very important for the very high data rates expected in ATM.  Figure 7.8    Format of the ATM cell  informationfieldi f r tifi lGFC VPIVCIVCIVCI5octett48octett8 BitGFC  Generic FlowControlVCI  Virtual ChannelIdentifierVPI  Virtual PathIdentifierPT  Payload TypeHEC  Header ErrorControlC  CLP  Cell LossPriorityHECCPTVPI8   7   6   5   4   3   2   1Protocol Elements for the AALcellheader    Figure 7.8 shows the structure of an ATM cell ITUT, I.361. This format corresponds to the cell at the usernetwork interface UNI, usually the delimitation point between a public ATM network and the private installation. There is a slight difference from the cell at the networknode interface NNI, i.e. between the nodes of the ATM network. In the NNI case, the cell header has no generic flow control GFC field, having an additional four VPI bits instead.  GFC  generic flow control GFC is a fourbit field providing flow control at the UNI for the traffic originated at user equipment and directed to the network, and does not control the traffic in the other direction i.e. for network to user traffic flow. It is not used within the network and is intended for use by access mechanisms that implement different access levels and priorities. Recommendation I.150 specifies the use of the GFC. The GFC must be capable of ensuring that terminals access their assured capacities, especially those having elements of guaranteed capacities. The remaining spare capacity should be shared fairly among all other terminals at that UNI. There are several proposed measures for fairness. Most of them are based on equal amounts of the spare capacity, or the same percentage of the additionally requested bit rate. A comprehensive analysis of fairness at different levels is presented in a number of papers and ATM Forum contributions.  The GFC should support different delays, as well as different delay variations, and requirements that can be met on a priority basis. It should be insensitive to the traffic mix, the number of terminals, and the distance between terminals.  The main intention of ATM is to accommodate high bit rates with small delays, providing no facilities for storing cells over longer period of time. So there is no reason for GFC inside an ATM network. It controls terminals connected to a customer network.  236  Report on Question 162 VPI  Virtual Path Identifier Field The VPI field at the UNI consists of eight bits four in the first octet, and four in the second octet. These bits are used for routing. The VPI at the NNI has an additional four bits 12 in total providing enhanced routing capabilities. The VPI is used to route cells between two nodes that originate, remove, or terminate the VPs. VCI  Virtual Channel Identifier Field The VCI field consists of 16 bits, and is used together with the VPI for routing. It distinguishes different connections and is used at the end nodes. PTI  Payload Type Identifier There are three bits in the ATM header to define the payload type. A value of 0 in the first bit of the PTI indicates user information, i.e. information from the next higher layer. In this case the second bit indicates whether congestion has been experienced 0 if not.  A value of 1 in the first bit is an indication that a cell carries network management or maintenance information. CLP  Cell Loss Priority The CLP field of the ATM cell header is a 1bit field used explicitly to indicate the cellloss priority. Due to the statistical multiplexing of connections, it is unavoidable that cell losses will occur in a BISDN connection. A cell with CLP equal to 1 may be discarded by the network during congestion, depending on the prevailing network conditions. A cell with CLP equal to 0 has higher priority and shall not be discarded if possible.  When a connection is established, the rate for higher priority cells is determined, if any higher priority is set for services requiring a guaranteed minimum capacity.  HEC  Header Error Control The HEC field is used mainly for two purposes to correct if possible or discard cells with corrupted headers and for cell delineation. The 8bit field provides for singlebit error correction, and a low probability that corrupted cells will be delivered. The HEC mechanism is specified by ITUT Recommendation I.432. It is a physical layer function, capable of correcting singlebit errors and detecting multiplebit errors in the ATM cell header. It should be noted that the numbering convention concerning the octet positions in a cell assumes the sending of octets bytes in increasing order. Therefore, the cell header is sent first. Bits within an octet are sent in decreasing order, starting with the most significant bit MSB. 7.6 The BISDN protocol reference model The BISDN protocol reference model BISDN PRM is shown in Figure 7.9 it is composed of  the user plane,   the control plane, and   the management plane.  Above the Physical Layer, the ATM Layer provides cell transfer for all services, and the ATM Adaptation Layer AAL provides servicedependant functions to the layer above the AAL. The layer above the AAL in the control plane provides call control and connection control. The management plane provides network supervision functions. Functional descriptions of the Physical Layer, the ATM Layer and the AAL are given in the following section. Further study is required on the functions of the layers above the AAL.   Report on Question 162 237 User plane The user plane, with its layered structure, provides for user information flow transfer, along with associated controls e.g. flow control, and recovery from errors, etc.. Control plane This plane has a layered structure and performs the call control and connection control functions it deals with the signalling necessary to set up, supervise and release calls and connections. The distinction, if any, between local and global control plane functions in the broadband environment is for further study.

Plane management has no layered structure. b Layer Management functions  The layer management performs management functions relating to resources and parameters residing in its protocol entities. Layer Management handles the operation and maintenance OAM information flows specific to the layer concerned. Additional details are provided in Recommendation Q.940. Note  A possible merger of Plane Management and Layer Management functions is for further study. 7.6.1 Functions of the individual layers of the BISDN PRM The functions of each layer, the primitives exchanged between layers, and primitives exchanged between layers and the management plane are described below. The information flows described do not imply a specific physical realization. Figure 7.10 illustrates the layers of the PRM, and identifies the functions of the Physical Layer, the ATM Layer, and the AAL. 238  Report on Question 162  Figure 7.10    Functions of the BISDN in relation to the protocol reference model   Higher layer functions Higher layers  Convergence CS  Segmentation and reassembly SAR AAL   Layer management Generic flow control Cell header generationextraction Cell VPIVCI translation Cell multiplex and demultiplex   ATM  Cell rate decoupling HEC header sequence generationverification Cell delineation Transmission frame adaptation Transmission frame generationrecovery  TC  Bit timing Physical medium PM    Physical layer CS Convergence sublayer PM Physical medium SAR Segmentation and reassembly sublayer TC Transmission convergence   A cell header contains only network related information. Detailed definitions describing various types of cells are given in ITUT Recommendation I.321. Cells that carry no information concerning the ATM and all higher layers are used at the physical layer.  Idle cell  is a cell that is insertedextracted at the physical layer in order to adapt the cell flow rate at the boundary between the ATM layer and the physical layer to the available payload capacity of the transmission system used. Valid cell  is a cell whose header has no errors or has been modified by the HEC verification process. Invalid cell  is a cell whose header has errors or has not been modified by the HEC verification process. It is discarded at the physical layer. Two types of cells are passed to the ATM layer Assigned cell  is a cell providing a service to an application using the ATM layer service.  Unassigned cell  is a cell without assignment.  Each layer handles different aspects of the connections. Since the connections can be extended over several nodes, it is necessary to exchange information between them. On each level there are protocols to be used for that purpose. 7.6.2 Physical Layer The physical layer is responsible for the transportation of cells. The ATM physical layer is actually divided into two parts the physical medium PM sublayer and the transmission convergence TC sublayer. The physical medium sublayer PM  is the lowest part in the PRM hierarchy and includes only the physical medium dependent functions. It is responsible for sending and receiving a continuous flow of bits with associated timing information to synchronize transmission and reception. So, the transmission capability including the generation and reception of waveforms that are suitable for the medium insertion and extraction of timing information, line coding is the main PM task.   Report on Question 162 239 The transmission convergence sublayer TC  is responsible for the cell delineation the identification of the cell boundaries, I.432, header error control, cell rate decoupling, transmission frame adaptation and transmission frame generation and recovery. Transmission frame adaptation is responsible for all the actions necessary to adapt the cell flow according to the used payload structure of the transmission system in the sending direction. This frame may be cell equivalent if no external frame is used or dependent on the transport network for instance SDH, xDSL. 7.6.3 The ATM Layer The ATM layer puts cells together in the correct format. It takes the 48byte information field formed in the AAL and adds the 5byte ATM cell header. The VPI and VCI values for each cell are calculated in the ATM layer. As mentioned previously the handling of Virtual Paths and Virtual Channels involves switching the cells coming in from the physical layer, based on routing tables. This routing handled by the ATM layer. ATM layer features are independent of the physical medium. There are four main functions which this layer is responsible for   Cell multiplexing  where the composite stream is a noncontinuous cell flow. At the receiving side, demultiplexing into individual cell flows appropriate to VP and VC is performed.  VPI and VCI translation  are performed at the switching nodes andor crossconnect nodes.   Cell header generationextraction  is performed at the terminating points of the ATM layer. The information field the 48 octets following the header is passed to the higher layer the adaptation ATM layer.   The GFC function  is defined for the usertonetwork interface. It can be used to alleviate shortterm overload conditions. GFC information is carried in assigned or unassigned cells. All cells are not equally prioritised. Within the same quality of service QoS the priority of cells is denoted by the value of the CLP bit in the cell header. If congestion occurs the lowest priority cells are discarded first. Also the cells flowing in a VP or VC must be sent in the right order. These functions are handled in the ATM layer. 7.6.4 The ATM Adaptation Layer The use of ATM generates the problem of supporting information flows which are not based on ATM. The simplest example is PCM pulse code modulation, sent in a continuous stream of octets. How to assemble PCM bits into cells for transmission, and how to read them on the receiving side, is the matter for the Adaptation Layer. ATM Service Classes The ITU have identified five service classes in respect of bit rate, timing relation between source and receiver, and connection mode. They are listed in Table 1. 240  Report on Question 162  Table 7.1    BISDN Service Classes, according to the ITUT    AAL Protocols The ATM Adaptation Layer AAL maps user and signalling information into ATM cells. The AAL itself is divided into sublayers. The AAL is involved only at the periphery of the ATM network, at the interface to the service network.  The AAL Convergence Sublayer  CS consists of a common part and a service part. It interfaces between the particular services supported and the segmentation and reassembly sublayer below.  The Segmentation And Reassembly sublayer  SAR carries out the conversion to and from the ATM cell format and may provide error detection and multiplexing. There are different types of SAR for different service types. Different service applications require different characteristics from the bearer service. Some require an unspecified bit rate, for example Internet applications, while others require a constant bit rate, for example, the PSTN. Due to the compression techniques used, interactive TV can be accommodated with a variable bit rate. The AAL adapts the ATM layer to the requirements of different ATM user applications. Several adaptation protocols are defined for the AAL. To minimize the number, the ITUT proposed a service classification, specific to the AAL. Classifications were made with respect to the following parameters  the timing relation if required,  the bit rate constant or variable bit rate, and  the connection mode connectionoriented or connectionless. The protocols were defined for use with different traffic types ITUT, I.363, as outlined below AAL1 This is the adaptation protocol for Constant Bit Rate CBR services. It is intended for connectionoriented services which require a timing relationship between the sourcedestination pair I.363.1 AAL2 This is the adaptation protocol for Variable Bit Rate VBR connectionoriented services requiring a timing relationship between the sourcedestination pair I.363.2. AAL3AAL4 The combined AAL3AAL4 protocol was defined principally for linking LANs and WANs. This is the adaptation protocol for VBR, connectionoriented services which require no timing relationship between the sourcedestination pair I.363.3.

Thus, it is intended for connectionless applications without timing requirements I.363.5. Detailed explanations of particular AAL protocols, based on the classification of the ATM services are given in the ITUT Recommendations  I.363.1 to I.363.5. As the ATMLayer provides a serviceindependent transport mechanism, an ATM Adaptation Layer AAL supports the higher layers by service dependent additional information. This information is transmitted in the information field of the cell and therefore is transparent to the ATMLayer. In order not to define an AAL for each service, the services are divided into different classes. The functions of the AAL are different for each different class of service. Examples of these functions are  segmentation of the payload in the cells,  reconstruction of the payload from the cells,  handling of the different cell delays,  handling of lost and misrouted cells,  timing reconstruction on the receiving side,  bit error detection in the information field,  handling of bit errors of the information field,  multiplexing and demultiplexing of payload information, The higher layers are unaware of the influence of the ATM principles. They deliver information to the AAL, which is responsible for the segmentation of the information stream into cells, protection means, and the handover of the cells to the ATMLayer for further transfer. The frequency of cells depends on the incoming information rate as illustrated in Figure 7.11. ATM encapsulates all information streams from different services into cells, places them into a synchronous cell stream, and routes them across an ATM network. The cells are inserted into time slots corresponding to the transfer time a cell and are queued if time slots are not available. They are transferred asynchronously preserving the cell sequence integrity principle. However, cell flow limitation has to be applied to avoid overloading the network. A successful ATM information exchange is based on defined protocols, specifying e.g. syntax, semantics, signalling and interfaces. Some of the functions involved in an ATM transmission between ATM terminals are described below in this case SDH is used as the transmission system From the send side AAL The payload depends on the transmitted service constant or variable bit rate, connection oriented or connectionless data ATM Addition of VC and VP addresses to header   VC conversion in ATM switch VP conversion in ATM cross connect  Multiplexing of cell streams.

AAL Delivery of the payload to the service receiver.  The header contains, in addition to the VC and VP addresses, information concerning flow control, cell loss priority, payload type identifier and Header Error Control. In the case of overload, low priority cells are eliminated to avoid network congestion. Erroneous cells are discarded. For endtoend management of the channel and path, OAM cells can be inserted at the send side and retrieved at the receive side to evaluate the quality of the transmitted information.  7.7 Operation and maintenance 7.7.1 OAM principles  The following principles have to be considered in specifying the operation and maintenance OAM functions of BISDN. a Performance monitoring   Performance monitoring is a function which processes user information to produce maintenance information specific to the user information. This maintenance information is added to the user information at the source of a connectionlink and extracted at the sink of a connectionlink. Analysis of the maintenance event information at the sink of the connection allows an estimation of the transport integrity to be provided. b Defect and failure detection   Defects or failures affecting the transport of user information are detected by either continuous or periodic checking. As a result, maintenance event information or alarms will be produced. c System protection   The effect of a defect on the transport of user information is minimized by blocking or changeover to other entities. As a result the failed entity is excluded from operation. d Defect information  Defect information is given to other management entities. As a result, alarm indications are given to other management planes. Response to a status report request will also be given. e Fault localization   Determination by internal or external test systems of a failed entity if defect information is insufficient. 244  Report on Question 162 7.7.2 OAM levels in the BISDN  OAM functions in the network are performed on five OAM hierarchical levels associated with the ATM and physical layers of the protocol reference model Recommendation I.610. The functions result in corresponding bidirectional information flows F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5 referred to as OAM flows see Figure 7.6. Not all of these flows need to be present. The OAM functions of a missing level are performed at the next higher level. The levels are as follows  Virtual channel level F5   Extends between network elements performing virtual channel connection termination functions and is shown extending through one or more path connections I.311.  Virtual path level  F4  Extends between network elements performing virtual path connection termination functions I.311 and is shown extending through one or more transmission paths.  Transmission path level F3   Extends between network elements assemblingdisassembling the payload of a transmission system and associating it with its OAM functions. Cell delineation and Header Error Control HEC functions are required at the end points of each transmission path. The transmission path is connected through one or more digital sections.  Digital section level F2  Extends between section end points and comprises a maintenance entity.  Regenerator section level F1  A regenerator section is a portion of a digital section and as such is a maintenance subentity. Relationship of OAM functions with the BISDN models OAM functions are allocated to the layer management of the BISDN protocol reference model. This layered concept and the requirements of independence of the layers from each other lead to the following principles 1 OAM functions related to OAM levels are independent from the OAM functions of other layers and have to be provided at each layer.  Each layer, where OAM functions are required, is able to carry out its own processing to obtain quality and status information. OAM functions are performed by the layer management. These results may be provided to the plane management or to the adjacent higher layer. Higher layer functions are not necessary to support the OAM of the lower layer. 7.7.3 F4 F5 flow mechanism The F4 F5 flow is bidirectional. OAM cells for the F4 F5 flow have the same VPI VCIVPI value as the user cells of the VPC VCC and are identified by one or more preassigned VCI PTI values. The same preassigned VCI PTI value shall be used for both directions of the F4 F5 flow. The OAM cells for both directions of the F4 F5 flow must follow the same physical route so that any connecting points supporting that connection can correlate the fault and performance information from both directions. There are two kinds of F4 F5 flows, which can simultaneously exist in a VPC. These are  Endtoend F4 F5 flow  This flow, identified by a standardized VCI PTI Recommendation I.361, is used for endtoend VPC VCC operations communications.  Segment F4 F5 flow  This flow, identified by a standardized VCI PTI Recommendation I.361, is used for communicating operations information within the bounds of one VPC VCC link or multiple interconnected VPC VCC links. Such a concatenation of VPC VCC links is called a VPC VPC segment.   Report on Question 162 245 One or more OAM segments may be defined along a VPC VCC. Nevertheless neither overlapped nor embedded segments can be defined. For that purpose it must be ensured that all intermediate Connecting Points CP in between the sourcesink CP of a segment shall not be a source or sink CP of another segment. The definition of the span of a managed segment is not necessarily fixed for the duration of a connection, i.e. the managed segment may be reconfigured as required. Note  A VPC VCC segment is typically under the control of one Administration or organization however, it can be extended beyond the control of one Administrationorganization by mutual agreement. Endtoend F4 F5 flows must be terminated at the endpoints of a VPC VCC and segment F4 F5 flows at the connecting points terminating a VPC VCC segment. Intermediate points i.e. connecting points along the VPC VCC or along the VPC VCC segment may monitor OAM cells passing through them and insert new OAM cells, but they cannot terminate the OAM flow, except when loopbacks are performed. In this case the loopback cell may be extracted from the OAM flow by the intermediate point where the loopback has to be performed and the looped cell may be extracted by the loopback originator upon reception. The F4 flow will be initiated at or after connection setup either by the Telecommunication Management Network TMN or by the OAM function dependent activation procedures. A source point of a VPC VCC segment acting in a downstream direction should discard unexpected VPC VCC segment OAM cells coming from the upstream side of the connection.  It shall be possible for any intermediate connecting point to be configured as a sourcesink of a VPC VCC segment. 7.8 Signalling in the atm network 7.8.1 Capabilities to control ATM virtual channel connections and virtual path connections for information transfer a Establish, maintain and release ATM VCCs and VPCs for information transfer. The establishment can be ondemand, semipermanent and should comply with the requested connection characteristics e.g. bandwidth, quality of service. b Support communication configurations on a pointtopoint, multipoint and broadcast basis. c Negotiate the traffic characteristics of a connection at establishment of the connection. d Ability to renegotiate source traffic characteristics of an already established connection. 7.8.2 Capability to support multiparty and multiconnection calls a Support of symmetric and asymmetric calls e.g. low or zero bandwidths in one direction and high bandwidths in the other. b Simultaneous establishment and release of multiple connections associated with a call. Note  The simultaneous establishment of multiple connections should not be significantly slower that the establishment of a single connection. c Two partymultiparty call establishment with or without any connections. d Simultaneous establishment and release of call and connections associated with a call. e Add and release one or more connections to and from an existing call by the calling party and called party. f Release the call by the called party. g Add and release one or more a partyies to and from a multiparty call by the calling party. 246  Report on Question 162 h Attachmentdetachment of one or more parties tofrom a connection. i Detachment from connections by the called party. j The capability to correlate when connections compose a multiconnection call, is required. Note  This correlation is handled by the origination and destination BISDN switches, which may be public or private.  k Reconfigure a multiparty call including an existing call or splitting the original multiparty call into more calls. 7.8.3 Others l Capability to reconfigure an already established connection, for instance, to pass through some intermediate processing entity such as a conference bridge. m Support interworking between different coding schemes. n Support interworking with non BISDN services, e.g. services supported by the PSTN or 64 kbits based ISDN. o Support interaction between IN and BISDN. p Support interaction between the TMN and the BISDN. q Support failure indication and automatic protection switching for semipermanent and permanent connections. 7.8.4 Signalling transport function At the user access point, multiple VPs may be used to carry Signalling VCs SVCs. These VPs may connect the user to the local exchange, other users, andor other networks. BISDN signalling configurations are classified as either pointtomultipoint or pointtopoint. A pointtomultipoint signalling configuration exists when a signalling entity point interacts with multiple signalling entities multipoint. In a pointtomultipoint signalling configuration, metasignalling procedures shall be used to request allocation of individual pointtopoint SVCs. A pointtopoint signalling configuration exists when a signalling entity interacts with another single signalling entity. When the signalling configuration is unknown, a pointtomultipoint signalling configuration shall be assumed. A signalling configuration can become known either by subscription or by a dynamic procedure. 7.8.5 Signalling Protocols There are three main signalling interfaces and related protocols used in ATM networks. They are the User Network Interface UNI, the Private NetworkNetwork Interface PNNI and the BISDN InterCarrier Interface BICI. UNI Allows User Network Interface subscriber access to an ATM network, the UNI subscriber recognition through ATM addressing, and the recognition of the QoS contract and characteristics of the data to be sent across the connection. PNNI Provides the signalling and routing protocols required for managing and controlling the ATM network configured to establish and support ondemand, switched connections and the mechanism that enable every node in the network to maintain uptodate topological information about every other node in the network. BICI The signalling and routing protocols required for managing on demand, switch connections between one ATM network and another ATM network. The BICI can also be used within an ATM network to improve the control of traffic routing.   Report on Question 162 247 7.9 Traffic management ATM traffic management is a combination of several functions that monitor and control the information flow within the ATM network. These functions are designed to guarantee each connection its negotiated QoS. To provide this, the user must inform the network, in the connection setup procedure, of both the expected nature of traffic as well as the type of QoS. The source node must inform the network of the traffic parameters and QoS for each direction.  A primary role of traffic management is to protect the network from congestion with the aim of complying with the network performance objectives. An additional role is realizing the efficient use of network resources.  Traffic control  represents a set of actions taken by the network in all relevant network elements to avoid congestion conditions. Congestion is considered to occur when there exists a set of one or more network elements which are not able to meet the negotiated QoS objective for the already established connections and for new connection requests. In general congestion can be caused by unpredictable statistical fluctuations of traffic flows or fault conditions within the network. Congestion control the set of actions taken to relieve congestion by limiting the spread and duration of it is one of the main tasks of traffic control. To meet these objectives, the following functions form a framework for managing and controlling traffic and congestion in ATM networks and may be used in appropriate combinations. This framework is based on the fundamental concept of a traffic contract the request QoS level for any given ATM connection and the maximum cell delay variation tolerance allocated to the customer equipment that is negotiated between the user and the network, and between networks when setting up a connection. Network Resource Management NRM  provisioning may be used to allocate network resources in order to separate traffic flows according to service characteristics. Although cell scheduling and resource provisioning are implementation and network specific, they can be utilized to provide appropriate isolation and access to resources. Connection Admission Control CAC  is defined as the set of actions taken by the network during the call establishment phase or during the call renegotiation phase in order to establish whether a virtual channelvirtual path connection request can be accepted or rejected or whether a request for reallocation can be accommodated. Choosing a path through the network is part of the connection admission control of the network.  ATM layer Resource Management RM  functions make use of resource management cells, e.g. to modify resources that are allocated to ATM connections. Feedback controls  are defined as the set of actions taken by the network and by the users to regulate the traffic submitted on ATM connections according to the state of network elements. This is related to the ABR service which uses a feedback control mechanism. UsageNetwork Parameter Control UPCNPC  is defined as the set of actions taken by the network to monitor and control traffic, in terms of traffic offered and validity of the ATM connection, at the user access and the network access, respectively. Their main purpose is to protect network resources from malicious as well as unintentional misbehaviour which can affect the QoS of other already established connections by detecting violations of negotiated parameter values or procedures, and taking appropriate actions. It supervises the cell stream sent during the connection. In the case when a subscriber exceeds its booked bit rate, the policing function can protect the network against overload by either reducing the priority of this connection cell tagging or in the case of real overload, by discarding cells. Priority controls PC  are functions that differentiate how cells are handled relative to each other by the network in terms of time priority or loss priority. Traffic shaping mechanisms  may be used to achieve a desired modification to the traffic characteristics of a connection. The objectives of this function are to achieve a better network efficiency whilst meeting the QoS objectives andor to ensure connection traffic performance at a subsequent interface. 248  Report on Question 162 The traffic control function is defined in the Recommendation I.371, and may be explained by the reference configuration given in Figure 7.13. It is composed of the following main components network resource management NRM, connection admission control CAC, usagenetwork parameter control UPCNPC, feedback controls and priority controls. Locations of these functions are presented in the figure.  A traffic parameter is a specification of a particular traffic aspect. It may be qualitative or quantitative. Traffic parameters may for example describe Peak cell rate PCR  an upper bound on the traffic that can be submitted on an ATM connection. It is defined in terms of the variable T, the minimum spacing between cells. Average cell rate ACR  the average rate of cell transfer on an ATM connection. Sustainable cell rate SCR  an upper bound on the average rate of cell transfer on an ATM connection. Cell delay variation CDV  the variation of actual cell arrival times on an ATM connection with respect to the theoretical cell arrival times,  Burstiness  ratio of the peak cell to the average cell rate. Maximum burst size MBS  is the maximum number of cells that can be sent continuously at the peak cell rate and may be derived from service type e.g. telephone, videophone.  Some of the above mentioned parameters are interdependent e.g. the burstiness with the average and peak cell rate. Service type can be used for implicit declaration by the user of a complete set of traffic parameters, e.g. by declaring the service requested voice, etc.. Service type may also include implicit declaration of QoS requirements. Such a descriptor would be used for example as an address of a lookup table delivering the corresponding set of traffic characteristics. In the case where it is used by a traffic source, it would therefore not be necessary to convey any other traffic parameters belonging to the source traffic descriptor via signalling. Additionally, service type may also be used to describe traffic characteristics of a source. This applies for example when typical source behaviours e.g. variable bit rate video using standard coding schemes are learned from operational experience or other means and used by network operators to apply specific traffic engineering rules, which may result in QoS indications rather than commitments. Traffic descriptor  The definition of the characteristics of the traffic that any given requested connection may offer. ATM traffic descriptor  A generic list of traffic parameters that can be used to capture the intrinsic traffic characteristics of an ATM connection. Source traffic descriptor  A set of traffic parameters belonging to the ATM traffic descriptor, which is used during the connection setup to capture the intrinsic traffic characteristics of the connection requested by the source. As a general requirement, it is desirable that a high level of consistency be achieved between the above traffic control capabilities. A specific subset of these generic functions together with relevant traffic parameters and parameter values, as well as appropriate control functions and procedures are combined to create an ATM Transfer Capability ATC.

From a users perspective an ATC is seen as suitable for a given set of applications. The reason a user would choose a service based on a particular ATM capability other than the deterministic bit rate transfer capability, is the potential for incurring a lower cost from the network provider.  From a network operators viewpoint, an ATC may provide gain through statistical multiplexing. There is not a onetoone correspondence between services or service classes e.g. broadband bearer service categories and ATM transfer capabilities that may be used. An upper layer data service may make use of 250  Report on Question 162 Deterministic Bit Rate capability DBR  This capability is used by a connection that requests a particular fixed amount of bandwidth that is continuously available for the duration of the connection. This amount of bandwidth is characterized by a peak cell rate. Although this capability corresponds to CBR applications, it is not restricted only to them. This is the default ATM transfer capability. Statistical Bit Rate capability SBR  In the Statistical Bit Rate SBR transfer capability the endsystem uses standardized traffic parameters sustainable cell rateintrinsic burst tolerance  SCRIBT or service type to describe, in greater detail than just the peak cell rate, the cell flow characteristics which will be presented to the connection. It is suitable for applications where there exists some prior knowledge of some traffic characteristics of the application. The delay performance of the SBR capability is not specified, and this capability may or may not support applications with stringent delay requirements. ATM Block Transfer capability ABT  An ATM Block Transfer ABT capability is an ATM layer mechanism for providing a service where the ATM layer transfer characteristics are negotiated on an ATM block basis. Within an ATM block accepted by the network, the network allocates sufficient resources such that the QoS received by the ATM block is equivalent to the QoS received by a DBR connection with the same peak cell rate as the negotiated peak cell rate of the ATM block, referred to as the Block Cell Rate BCR. Specifically, an ATM block is defined as a group of cells of an ATM connection delineated by two Resource Management RM cells, one before the first cell of the ATM block leading RM cell and the other after the last cell of the ATM block trailing RM cell. The exact definition of the RM cells delineating an ATM block depends on the specific usage of RM cells, namely on the ABT capability. The trailing RM cell of an ATM block may be the leading RM cell of the subsequent ATM block. The BCR of an ATM block is constant over the ATM block duration. Available bit rate transfer capability ABR  Many applications have the ability to reduce their information transfer rate if the network requires them to do so, or they may wish to increase their information transfer rate if there is extra bandwidth available within the network. There may be, not only static traffic parameters but also dynamic traffic parameters, as the users may be willing to accept unreserved bandwidth. To support traffic from such sources in an ATM network, an ATM transfer capability is defined which is termed Available Bit Rate ABR. ABR is an ATM transfer capability where the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may change subsequent to connection establishment. It is expected that a user that adapts its traffic to the changing ATM layer transfer characteristics will experience a low Cell Loss Ratio CLR. Cell delay variation and cell transfer delay are not controlled. The ABR capability is not intended to support CBR applications. The user adapts to the changing ATM layer transfer characteristics upon receiving feedback from the network. Due to cell transfer delay, this feedback reflects the status of the network at some point in time prior to the instant when the user receives it. So even when the user adapts correctly to the feedback, the network may still have to provide some buffering to enable low cell loss operation of ABR. User actions, feedback from the network, and user responses to the feedback from the network, together constitute a control loop on the ABR connection. A user will specify a maximum required bandwidth to the network on establishment of an ABR connection. The maximum required bandwidth is negotiated between user and network and between user and user at connection establishment. A minimum usable bandwidth also referred to as the minimum cell rate or MCR shall be specified on a perconnection basis, but it may be specified as zero. The bandwidth available from the network may become as small as the minimum usable bandwidth. The maximum required bandwidth also referred to as the peak cell rate or PCR and the MCR are predefined. The value of the PCR and of the MCR can be different for each direction of the connection.   Report on Question 162 251  Figure 7.14    Defining of the available cell rate ABR service.  B A ABR traffic capacity     7.9.2 ATM Forum Service Categories The relation of the ITU Recommendation I.371 to the ATM Forum based on transfer capabilities is given in the aftm0121.000 specification. The ATM Forum defines six service categories, concerning the bit rate and specific requirements for peak cell rate PCR, sustainable cell rate SCR, cell delay variation tolerance CDVT, maximum burst size MBS, minimum cell rate MCR, minimum frame size MFS, cell transfer delay CTD, cell loss ratio CLR and use of feedback, see Table 2. The ATM Forum specifies classification of service categories. The first one, constant bit rate CBR, is present in the ITUT description of ATM transfer capabilities. It is used for connections that request a static amount of bandwidth that is continuously available during the connection. It is characterized by the peak cell value. In variable bit rate transfer the ATM Forum distinguishes the two categories, the realtime rtVBR and nonrealtime nrtVBR. The differences are derived by specifying the maximum cell transfer delay requirements. A service category with no specified bit rate the unspecified bit rate UBR is defined by the ATM Forum. It has no corresponding service capability in the ITU Recommendations. An example of such an application is traditional computer communication. The ABR and UBR services have been developed from the best effort service 8.  In May 1999, the ATM Forum adopted the final version of the guaranteed frame rate GFR service intended for nonrealtime applications that may require a minimum guarantee and can benefit from accessing additional bandwidth dynamically available in the network. The similar ATM service capability GFR is under study in the ITUT.       252  Report on Question 162  Table 7.2    ATM service categories according to the ATM forum   ATM Layer Service Category Attribute CBR rtVBR nrtVBR UBR ABR GFR Traffic Parameters4  PCR and CDVT5 Specified Specified2 Specified3 Specified SCR, MBS, CDVT5 na Specified na MCR na Specified na MCR, MBS, MFS, CDVT5 Na Specified QoS Parameters0  Peaktopeak CDV Specified Unspecified maxCTD Specified Unspecified CLR Specified Unspec.

The actual rate is subject to the control information. 4 These parameters are either explicitly or implicitly specified for PVCs or SVCs. 5 CDVT refers to the Cell Delay Variation Tolerance. CDVT is not signalled. In general, CDVT need not have a unique value for a connection. Different values may apply at each interface along the path of a connection. 6 CLR is low for frames that are eligible for the service guarantee. Whether a quantitative value for CLR is specified is network specific. 7 CTD  cell transfer delay 8 MFS  maximum frame size.   7.10 ITUT References General references 1 ATM Forum Specifications AFTM0121000, 1999.  2 S.
