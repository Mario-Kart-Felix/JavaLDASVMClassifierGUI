The CIV main goal is to bring a general and synthetic view on WWI validation activities. The CI Validation team is composed of key representatives of validation work package, plus one CIV leader. Cross Issue Validation missions are three fold  Sharing of information related to validation activities in the projects Analyzing and creating a global view of WWI demos Dissemination of CIV results.This deliverable presents all the results and achievements of CIV. Chapters 2 and 3 give a description of the major demostrials of each WWI project. Within the Cross Issue Validation team, we defined a common set of criteria that we then use to fully describe the demostrials. These common cirteria facilitate information sharing between the projects, and enable people unused to a given project to better understand the goal and means of a demo. Based on this better knowledge of WWI projects demos, we defined transversal approches to highlight relationships between demostrials of the different WWI projects. These cross analyses aim at expressing the links, similarities and complementarities between the demostrials, and are presented in chapter 4.This leads to the elaboration of a global scenario, presented in chapter 5. This global story line includes all WWI projects and highlights their specificities and complementarities towards an integrated endtoend B3G architecture. In the global scenario,you can find in parallel a simple everyday life story technical references to WWI concepts and demos.Anyone, whatever his age or interest in technology, will be interested by services presented in the everyday life story there are every day use cases. Whereas technophile people will also be interested to see what are the conceptsdemos underpinning these new services and their tight integration.This global scenario provides a good overview on WWI projects concepts and demos, and show how they can fit together for B3G system. Dissemination is a key mission for the transversal group that is cross issue validation. All dissemination activities led by CIV are presented and illustrated in chapter 6  conferences participation  IST Summit,  WWI Innovation Day,  etc,  with demo opening, poster presentation, demos presentation paper submitted to a European conference article written by journalists based on CIV leader interview internal WWI presentationsWe conclude with an assessment of transversal CIV activities and propose directions for future works in projects demos.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 398Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Table of ContentContract 027617.................................................................................................... 1SPICE..................................................................................................................... 1Service Platform for Innovative Communication Environment............................ 1WWI Cross Issue Validation..................................................................................1Final report............................................................................................................. 11.

Each of these WWI projects intends to set up one or several demonstrations andor trials.  The goal  of  the  Cross  Issue  Validation CIV  is  to  give a  general  and synthetic  view on these validation activities led in each of the WWI projects. The CIV work is fed by the contact names of each WWI project. The  CIV objectives  are  to  give  a  description  of  the  main  demos of  each  project,  and to  analyze  the similarities and the complementarities of these demos. One achievement of the CIV is to build a global scenario based on WWI demos and concepts, illustrating how WWI projects can be assembled towards providing enhanced value added endtoend services. Dissemination activities of CIV are also presented.Note Throughout the deliverable are used the terms demonstrations and trials. We propose hereafter a definition of these terms.  Trial test including some users with the purpose of confirming theoreticalexpected results. Demonstration test presented to a public without users to showsimulate successful trials.When distinction between demonstration and trial is tenuous, or not meaningful, the term demotrial is also employed in a generic way.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M242.Phase1 demonstrations and trialsThe purpose of this chapter is to present a brief status about the demonstrations and trials that took place during the phase 1 of the WWI projects, covering the 20042005 period. 2.1Ambient Networks Phase 1Already during Ambient Networks Phase 1 seven demonstrations and prototypes have been built AND16, showcasing e.g. a media delivery scenario or the integration of a car network. These demonstrations have focused on one, two or three of the Ambient Networks concepts.  For these concepts,  the viability and usefulness of the Ambient Networks concepts has been demonstrated along a set of different user scenarios. The proven usefulness of  these demonstrations,  both as dissemination and as  validation tools has also influenced and motivated the demonstration approach for Ambient Networks Phase 2, where one integrated prototype is developed.2.2E2R Phase 1During phase 1, E2R developed a modular, flexible and evolutionary environment allowing the integration of hardwaresoftware modules produced within all the different work packages. Demonstrations and trials have taken place during several events.In the first year In June 2004, E2R prototyping team had a booth at the IST Mobile and Wireless Summit, held in Lyon, where the objectives, the components and architecture of the platform have been presented. Then, the E2R Workshop colocated with IEEE PIMRC 04 conference was held in Barcelona,  in September 2004. During this event an advanced version of the Reconfigurability Control and Service Provision Manager Platform was demonstrated. The E2R Demonstration Day was held in SophiaAntipolis in November 2004, where the first preintegrated  demonstration  took  place.  Three  demonstration  scenarios  have  been  presented  namely, software upgrade, security and certification processes, mobility and UMTSTDD operation.  The first years work was demonstrated during the audit in January 2005, held in Motorola premises in Saclay. Scenarios regarding network driven mode switch, service deployment and software upgrade have been demonstrated.In the second year The first event of second year  for E2R I was the IST Mobile and Wireless Summit 2005 held in Dresden  in  June  2005,  where  scenarios  regarding  controlled  software  upgrade,  application  layer reconfiguration, service provision and device management were presented. Finally,  a  fullybloated  scenario  featuring  networkuser  initiated  application  layer  reconfiguration, protocol  layer  reconfiguration  ,  PatchesProfile  updates  and  intelligent  service  selection  has  been demonstrated in the frame of the MOCCAWWI symposium held in Paris 67 December 2005 event More details  about  the events  and the scenarios  that  were demonstrated  during them can be found in E2RD6.5.2.3MobiLifeWithin MobiLife both trials and demonstration events have been organized. Both trials and demonstration events  have  been  instrumental  to  achieving  MobiLife  goal  to  respond  to  actual  user  requirements. Therefore user evaluations, as well as expert evaluations, have been performed at the occasion of the events and are to be seen as integral part of the events themselves.More specifically in MobiLife,  there is a distinction between the occasional demo provided at external events, such as fairs, conferences etc, given for the purpose of dissemination and the MobiLife targeted demo events oriented at specific audience type and where the collection of feedback was part of the event. In such understanding the demo events have had local significance.MobiLife has had three of such targeted demo eventsDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 Demo 1 at the end of the first project year September 2005, oriented at SMEs. The demo took place in Milan, hosted by HP, in their HP Bazaar. Demo 2 about six months after February 2006, oriented at the endusers. The demo took place in Turin at the occasion of the Winter Olympics. Applications where customized to the event. A Demo 3 event took place both in Finland September 2006  oriented at SME  and in Italy October 2006  oriented at a technical audience from the academia and research world, as well as industry.The MobiLife trials took place in Finland and in Italy, with different applicationsIn Italy two main applications were offereda Personal  Context  Communicator  PCC  a  framework  application  including  Communications context  management,  CW  basic  characteristics,  Personal  Context  Monitoring  HeartPod, Proactive Service Portal b TimeGems In Finland three applications were offeredc FamilyMapsd Privacy Display Widgete Context WatcherFor  the  purpose  of  this  deliverable,  it  is  appropriate  to  focus  on  two  trials  only  Personal  Context Communicator and Integrated Family Maps.2.4SPICEThe SPICE project joined the WWI platform in the beginning of 2006, i.e. at the start of Phase 2. Hence, the demonstration activities will be shown later on in chapter 3 as part of phase 2.2.5WINNER Phase 1In WINNER Phase 1, there were no demonstrations or trials. Of the current trials in Phase II, the work for RRM Radio Resource Management trials started late in Phase 1, resulting in preliminary specifications, but there were no trials, nor demonstration events.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 898Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M243.Phase 2 demonstrations and trialsThe purpose of this chapter is to give a description of the demonstrations or trials of each of the WWI projects. In the case of several demonstratorstrials in a project, the most relevant ones have been chosen for analysis.The goal in this chapter is to gather the WWI demos descriptions, and, above all, to give means to compare these demos, to have a transversal view on these, and to have sufficient information for the cross analysis  work in chapter 4.Therefore, a list of criteria has been defined. All demos are described following the same frame, using this common set of criteria. Each project is introduced with a very short summary so that readers who had few information about the project get a little acquainted with the projects goals and context.3.1Common set of criteriaHereafter is given the common list of criteria, along with its short explanationQ Title and descriptionIs it a demo or a trial Add a few words about the contextQ HypothesisGive the main assumptions or the preconditions both for the demostrials and for the scenarioQ Simplifications, restrictionsFor example a demo that demonstrates the automatic translation of the content from one  resolution to  another  one on another  radio  technology  could consider that  the  handover  works well in 100 of the cases as this is not what they aim at demonstrating Other example the channel is supposed to be flat without any fadingQ Demotrial roadmap  current stateGive the milestones of the demotrialQ Difficulties and risks For ex we need the development of a SW stack Q Position in the networkWhich part of the network is tackled by the demotrial Is it core network, access network,  service platform, end user, end to end, etc. What is simulated howQ Goal, what is expected to be provenQ Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityGive the inputs and outputs of the demotrial.

The project has developed a new networking concept that embraces a very wide range of user  scenarios,  and accommodates a diverse set  of  current and innovative technical solutions. The breadth of the work demands projectwide activities to define the overall technical scope, and to position the concept within a model of the current and future business environment. To define the upper and lower boundaries of the networking functionality, Ambient Networks has developed detailed specifications for a pair of interlayer interfaces. At the upper boundary, the Ambient Service Interface ASI provides uniform access to the Ambient Networks functionality from higher  layers,  and a bearerlevel abstraction has been developed to represent end to end communications services. Bearer capabilities range from simple data transfer to special purpose media handling. The ASI and bearer abstractions are key enablers for universal deployment of new services and applications and the transparent and incremental  deployment  of added value networking functionality to support them.At the lower boundary, the Ambient Resource Interface ARI encapsulates the capabilities of the underlying infrastructure, and a flow level abstraction provides the basic building block of data transfer  between  addresses.  Because  these  abstractions  are  not  tied  to  any  specific  network technology,  the  AN  control  functions  are  portable  between  different  network  types  this decoupling  enables  a  simple  migration  path  from  current  systems  to  the  Ambient  Networks approach.Ambient  Networks  has  developed  the  concept  of  the  Ambient  Control  Space  ACS,  an environment within which a set  of modular  control functions  can coexist  and cooperate.  The environment is based on plugplay concepts that allow the ACS to bootstrap and discover the set of  supported  functions  dynamically  a  naming  structure  and registration  mechanisms  are  also defined, so that new functionality can be developed and integrated without impacting the overall system design and implementation. In order to communicate between two ACSs, the Ambient Networks Interface ANI is used. A severe barrier to the seamless communication across an internetwork is the problem of bridging the heterogeneous naming and addressing schemes in use. Because of the critical importance of the problem, the project has developed and compared a pair of candidate solutions, both based on the fundamental concept of a split between identifier and locator namespaces, and both supporting the requirements needed for ACS operation. The project has further developed the concept of network composition as the core approach to achieve the dynamic integration of control functionality  the ACS  across a heterogeneous set of networks. No more than a simple vision at the start  of the project, the concept has now been defined  with  a  detailed  lifecycle  for  the  composition  process  as  an  extension  of  ACS bootstrapping, which incorporates a framework for dynamically establishing agreements based on preexisting templates. Q Title and description Five demonstrations are developed on top of the Ambient Network Phase 2 Integrated Prototype.One of the key deliverables of Ambient Networks Phase 2 is an integrated prototype. Using the Ambient Networks concept of a distributed, modular control plane Ambient Control Space, ACS AND15, the different work packages develop prototype implementations of the concepts they are working on, e.g. mobility management, network composition or the management of overlay networks AND15.  These  different  control  functions,  referred  to  as  Functional  Entities  FEs AND15, will then be integrated to form one integrated ACS. It is however also clear that the control functionality alone is not very useful without a concrete user scenario involving applications and services that use the features of the control space. Thus, a set of applications and services will be developed. It challenges the different control functions and Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1098Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24illustrates their usefulness in concrete user scenarios. Five demonstrations have been derived from the scenario see below.Q HypothesisThe key idea of the prototype is that the concepts developed in the project can be implemented as control functions. These control functions then constitute the distributed modular ACS. An ACS has three interfaces Ambient Networks Interface ANI, sideways to interface to other Ambient Networks Ambient Resource Interface ARI, downward to interface with the connectivity, e.g. WINNER RAN Radio Access Network, legacy RANs or other connectivity resources. Ambient  Service  Interface  ASI,  upward  to  interface  to  applications,  services  and service platformsThrough the three Ambient Networks interfaces AND15, the control space prototype can then communicate with applications, services, or most relevant in this context  with the prototype implementations  of  other  WWI projects.  We also assume that  the overall  system architecture, developed in Ambient Networks Phase 1 AND15, is consistent on a high level so that no major overlaps and conflicts will occur in the integration.Q Simplifications, restrictionsGenerally,  no major simplifications are made to the hypothesis,  however some decisions were taken  limit  the  options  for  implementation.  The  implementation  of  the  prototype  has  been constrained  to  one  operating  system  FreeBSD  and  to  x86  PC  hardware.  For  the  sake  of simplicity,  the  number  of  supported  Radio  Access  Technologies  needs  to  be  limited  in  the beginning. Likely, 802.11 WLANs will be the first RAT to be supported, others will follow. Other limitations may exist in the different implementations but, because of the very diverse work, it is difficult to formulate to a generalized statement on this matter. Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateFor the development of the Ambient Networks phase 2 Integrated Prototype, four  major, externally visible milestones exist The first demonstration has been at the first EU project review in early 2007. Here, a first version of the integrated prototype will be shown. A large degree of integration will already be visible, while the depth of the implementation and also a limited set of user scenarios can be demonstrated. The first public presentation has been at the IST Mobile Summit 2007 in Budapest. The sophistication and depth of the different implementation will further increase, and an extended part of user scenario will be shown. A joint demonstration with the other WWI projects has taken place at the WWI Innovation in Brussels on November 13th. Apart from minor additions to the demos, the state that was presented represents the final state. The second EU project review in early 2008 will be the final milestone. Until then, the integration will be finalized and a high degree of sophistication of the different control functions will be reached. Q Difficulties and risks The distributed development of very diverse components by different groups of implementers can surely be regarded as a challenging task. The large number of involved parties and the very diverse concepts that need to be integrated require a lot of coordination and a strong commitment from all the implementers. Apart from these general concerns, also practical issues need to be solved to e.g. get the different software modules running on one PC without conflicts in software libraries etc. A number of dedicated integration meetings is planned in order to ensure good communication and coordination  between  the  involved  parties.  In  addition,  a  set  of  tools  CVS,  Wiki,  Doxygen, mailing lists has been deployed that help in managing this task. Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1198Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q Position in the networkAmbient Networks aims at developing a control layer that spans all kinds of networks, ranging from a small PAN Personal Ambient Network up to networks as large as an operator network. Q Goal, what is expected to be provenIn the Ambient  Networks project,  a lot of different concepts are developed, which will  all  be represented  in  the  integrated  prototype.  A  good  summary  is  contained  in  AND15,  a  short overview is contained here Mobility Management The HandOver and Locator Management functions ensure that bearers remain independent and unaware of connectivity changes or movement events that occur in the underlying connectivity. Flow Management and Access Selectiono The  Flow and  MultiRadio  Resource  Management  functions  configure  and establish flows both in the wired as well as in the wireless part of the network. MRRM is the subclass of flow management  that  is  responsible  for the radio access parts.o The Connectivity Management and Generic Link Layer functions detect new links and initiate the establishment of connectivity between ANs across them.   Triggering and Context  Management  functions coordinate  the storage,  access  control, dissemination  and  aggregation  of  context  information.  Context  information,  such  as triggers, user preferences or network status, is available in the highly distributed context information base. Context information can only be accessed according to explicit policies, to ensure privacy and protect business information Service  Aware  Transport  Overlays  offer  endtoend  bearer  services  to  applications through the ASI. Overlay management provides bearers that are aware of the semantics of media streams and can manipulate them along the delivery path. Composition Negotiation, Realization and Management functions govern the composition process through coordination with other control functions, negotiate with composing ANs and realize the established composition agreements.   Network  Attachment  functions  populate  and  maintain  policy  databases,  configuration information, subscriberuser data and preferences. Security Domains Management functions manage membership and policies for security domains, which are groupings of resources with a common management object according to certain security policies. They allow secure interactions within the group or with other objects in a common way. The modular Plugand Play control space is a key enabler for the integrated prototype. It allows the dynamically add and remove control functions and allows the control space to operate as a distributed system. Apart from showing the usefulness of each concept by itself, the main message of the Ambient Networks phase 2 Integrated Prototype is that all the diverse functionality developed in the project fits together and can work as one integrated, comprehensive solution. Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityAccording  the  WWI system  architecture,  the  inputs  and  outputs  all  go  over  the  three  major Ambient Networks interfaces Ambient  Networks  Interface  ANI,  horizontally  to  interface  to  other  Ambient Networks. Inputs and outputs on this type of interface are mainly about interAmbient Network information contexts, resource management, end to end availability, etc. Ambient Resource Interface ARI, downward to interface with the connectivity, e.g. WINNER RAN Radio Access Network, legacy RANs or other connectivity resources. The ARI is  then used to e.g.  receive radio measurements from the RANs or  to send configuration commands to the RAN. Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1298Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 Ambient  Service  Interface  ASI,  upward  to  interface  to  applications,  services  and service platforms. So e.g. SPICE or MobiLife should use the ASI to invoke transport overlays or other services from the Ambient Network. Within the AN demonstrations, the ASI will also be the interface towards the user applications, e.g. a GUI to visualize the control space internals or small applications to control and challenge the different control space functions. Hence the inputs to the Ambient Network from this interface are service needs  descriptions  that  may  rely  on  resources  controlled  by  the  Ambient  Network. Outputs  from the  Ambient  Network  through  this  interface  are  information  about  the progress of such resource requests.Q Demotrial scenarios A common scenario the Joint Use Case has been developed in early 2006. It aims at giving the individual work packages a better idea of which functionality is exactly needed and also forms the basis the planning of the individual demonstrations.The Joint Use Case describes a day in the life of a highly mobile business worker travelling to a meeting. On the way to this meeting, he attends video conferences, downloads data, interacts with coworkers and does a lot of other things. The complete use case can be found in ANDH1, it is also contained in the annex of this document. It is obvious that a set of control functions can only be demonstrated in an understandable way if they are embedded in user scenarios that challenge the different control functions. Five scenarios have been selected for realization. The JUC has evolved into the following demonstrations to be realized Demonstration 1 At home implements a scene in which the actor is about to leave home and needs to attend an online training while traveling. Adaptive transport overlays realize a customized media delivery, supported by context information in the network and relying on Security Domain authentication. Using the network composition concept, Bob can switch to an alternative access network, which had never been in contact with before, when he leaves the house. A compensation function negotiates the settlement details. The handover to this new access handled by advanced handover selection and multiaccess functions.  Demonstration 2 In the car features the integration of legacy networks, in this case vehicular networks, using gateways. In the demonstration, context information is obtained from the network, e.g. to transfer the route planning and organizer data to different devices. The dynamic interaction with other networks is achieved using network composition, supported by advertisements sent out by different networks along the way. Demonstration 3 At the train station puts the spotlight on some other key features of Ambient Networks. It shows different resource sharing models that are supported by network composition, and illustrates how the composition management interacts with the network management functions. The novel concept of Node ID routing is used to ensure reachability of the user despite frequently changing points of network attachment. Further on, an application of the adaptive transport overlay is displayed, this time focusing on environment without central coordination.  Demonstration 4 In the train shows how different mobility mechanisms are embedded and coordinated in the Ambient Networks architecture. The advanced information and functionality available in the Ambient Control Space is used to further optimize the mobility behavior, e.g. using the common policy framework and a tight collaboration with the radiolevel multiaccess functions. Demonstration 5 Sensor networks finally shows that Ambient Networks can not only interact  with  legacy  networks,  but  are  also  compatible  with  other  emerging  network types, in this case sensor networks. A gateway has been developed to mediate between the two worlds, so that sensor information can be fed into Ambient Networks as context information or status triggers, e.g. to support the network composition. Demo 1  Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1398Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The details of these demonstrations are being worked out at the time this document is written, thus they can only be presented at this high level. The outcome of the detailed specification will be documented in Ambient Networks Deliverable DH.1 ANDH1. Q What has been developed by the project added value  whats new  HW, SW, proof of concept The project develops the software module to realize the different concepts outlined above. These are  mainly  new developments  i.e.  almost  no  code  has  been  taken  over  from phase  1.  The software development also includes the ACS Framework which implements the concept of the modular control space and is the key enabler for the integration. Hardware is not being developed. Q HW and SW descriptionAs outlined above, a standard x86 PC hardware will be the basis for the prototype. Other types of hardware might be added later e.g. the Nokia 770 Internet Tablet, but this is not a requirement. The operating system will be FreeBSD. The different software components will be developed on C, C, Java and Python. The interoperability and the interprocess communication is provided by SOAP communication taken from the Web Services realm. The web service communication will be realized with Apache TomcatAxis and gSOAP.Q What are the evaluation criteria of the demosThe two main evaluation criteria are Integration of all the different components in order to show they can work together as a comprehensive overall system Usefulness and featurerichness of the individual conceptsQ What added value coming from the IP is involved in the demotrial More or less everything is developed from scratch. A few earlier developments are included but these are rather exceptions. Q How do we take advantage of the new features developed in the different projects And relevance for a global WWI demoOne would need to use the Ambient Networks interfaces to connect to the contribution of other projects, e.g. Interface to a WINNER RAN via ARI to make use of the novel features offered by the WINNER radio interface.  Have a SPICE application platform using the ASI to setup its connections, draw context data from the network, etc. Same might be true for a MobiLife application, or the MobiLife application runs on a SPICE platform which in turn runs on an AN To be  studied  how to  cooperate  with  E2R,  possibly  in  the  area  with  reconfigurable hardwaresoftwaredefined radio.3.3E2R Phase IISummary of the projectWithin  E2R, work package WP8 Proof of  concept  is  responsible  for  validation and demonstration activities. WP8 is one of the three vertical work packages together with WP6, WP7, that have the role of integrating, synchronizing and harmonizing work within the different horizontal WPs WP1WP5. WP8 is conducting work in the direction of validating the results of WPs 1  4. Validation activities rely on either  local  prototypes  or  trials  that  will  be conducted on the WP5 reference  prototyping environment RPE.  The  reference  prototyping  environment  will  consist  of  terminal  systems  and a  powerful  allIP network  infrastructure,  where  different  radio  access  technologies  are  available  including  both heterogeneous and multimode aspects. The prototype network infrastructure will consist of GSMGPRS, UMTSHSDPAEDGE, WLAN IEEE 802.11x, WMAN WiMax segments.More  specifically,  the  work  is  targeted  to  the  validation  of  business  models,  system  architecture, mechanisms  for  radio  resource  and  spectrum  efficiency,  and  platform  for  dynamic  and  robust Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1498Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24reconfigurable  connectivity.  In  particular,  the  WP8  objectives  can  be  stated  as  follows  E2RValid E2RD8.1  to define validation criteria, both qualitative and quantitative, for the work on business models, system architecture, enhanced radio resource and spectrum efficiency mechanisms, and platform for dynamic and robust reconfigurable connectivity to refine scenarios defined in E2R I that will ensure the realization of comprehensive validation studies, for  the components of  the horizontal  WPs,  which will  be demonstrated and validated through the reference prototyping environment to realize the integration of the selected parts that will be demonstrated and validated through the E2R reference prototyping environment. This will involve work on business models, system architecture, mechanisms for  radio resource  and spectrum efficiency,  and the  platform for  dynamic  and robust reconfigurable connectivity to realize the local prototyping activities and trials, according to the specified test cases, and to assess the degree of compliance with respect to the validation criteria, and to  provide  feedbacks  to  the  horizontal  WPs  in  term  of  global  coherency  of  the  developed functionalities and mechanisms.In order to satisfy the objectives above, WP8 is split into 5 subwork packages sWPs, each one related to the 5 horizontal WPs. In particular, sWP8.1 is responsible for validation of business models, sWP8.2 is responsible for validation of the system architecture, sWP8.3 is responsible for validation of mechanisms for enhanced radio resource and spectrum efficiency, sWP8.4 is responsible for validation of platform for dynamic and robust connectivity and finally, sWP8.5 is responsible for demonstrations and trials on the reference prototyping environment.Demonstration activities in E2RIIFramed within the above objectives and concepts,  seven different demos have been developed and are available  at  the  moment,  each  of  which  showcasing  an  essential  featuretechnology  for reconfigurablecognitive wireless systems as dealt within E2R. As depicted in the high level view of the validation  approach in  Figure  31,  the demos  include software and hardware  modules  E2RD5.3  and concern both network and terminal reconfigurable infrastructure and management functionality.

E2R  Demo  3  on  reconfigurable  network  elements  Flexible  Base  Stations  FBS  capable  of dynamically alteringadapting the Radio Access Technologies and spectrum of operation by the use of the OMGs Software Radio Specification and a DSP MicroFramework. This demonstration shows how the use of the OMGs SW Radio Specification will ease the installation and reconfiguration of Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1598Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24RATs  Radio  Access  Technologies  in  a  Base  Station.  The  use  case  developed  here  is  the reconfiguration of the Base Band Board from a 802.16 type RAT to a UMTS RAT, enabling also both RATs running at the same time. E2R Demo 4 on both management of reconfigurable network elementssegments and reconfigurable terminals This demo is actually a combined demo where both Network and Terminal reconfiguration management functionalities are exposed.  Regarding network reconfiguration management the demo mainly exposes DNPMASM Dynamic Planning and ManagementAdvanced Spectrum Management functionality implemented within E2R. The purpose is to showcase a management tool that aims at a making  decisions  for  optimal  reconfiguration  of  network  elements  mainly  in  terms  of  selecting RATsspectrumfrequency  to  operate  at,  and  b  deriving  policies  that  will  be  propagated  to  the terminals in order to ensure  a communication that  exhibits  optimum resource usage for a  specific region  or  temporal  zone  within  a  day.  The  demo  assumes  simulated  modules  for  network infrastructure. As for equipment reconfiguration management, the demo mainly exposes the REMS Reconfigurable Equipment Management System implemented within E2R. Each terminal listens to a CPC Cognitive Pilot Channel  as described below in demo 7 in order to acquire information and policies that will be used to assist its selection of a RATfrequency to camp on. The decision upon selection is done by an algorithmic management functionality implemented in the terminal and must be also in compliance with the downloaded policies. In  case the selected RAT is not available in the terminal,  proper  SW  downloading  and  installation  may  be  conducted.  The  demo  assumes  both simulated and hardware modules NOKIA 770 tablet for terminal infrastructure.

E2R  Demo  7  on  Cognitive  Pilot  Channel  CPC  prototype  implementation  The  CPC  acts  as  a reconfiguration enabler and is used to force a handoff between two HSDPA cellular access points. It must be noted that most of the above demosfunctionalities benefit from the services provided by a CPC Cognitive Pilot Channel instance E2RCPC. The CPC services could be provisioned either form a  physical  channel  on a totally  new frequency outband solution  or  from a logical  channel multiplexed with existing control channels inband solution or even from a simple URL address. In any manifestation, the CPC role is to convey context information regarding the availability and use of RATsfrequencies  in  a  certain  area,  as  well  as  to  provide  policies  for  ensuring  optimized communication, thus facilitating optimum network selection.In the following of this section, the above demos are further described according to the common set of criteria.3.3.1Demo on reconfigurable components and systems 1Q Title and descriptionDemo  of  combined  SystemonChip  SoC    FPGA  partial  reconfiguration  PR  in  a  NoC architecture E2RNoCE2RPRQ HypothesisThis demo would take place in the context of a medium term SDR systems, or in the longer term of a cognitive radio system.Q Simplifications, restrictionsThe triggering  order  of  reconfiguration  is  activated  manually in  order  to  show the performance enhancement brought by the reconfiguration.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateThe demo is currently supported by the CEA NoCbased FAUST SoC for a video transmission on a 4G baseband link corrupted by a variable gain white Gaussian noise to provoke some transmission error. The SoC is reconfigured so that the transmission shifts from a 16 QAM with a coding rate of  for high SNR to a QPSK and a coding rate of  at low SNR, so that QoS is kept sufficient for the transmission of a video data stream with no visible error. In a last step, or the audit, the constellation mapper  and  the  encoder  will  be  instantiated  in  a  FPGA  and  reconfigured  using  partial reconfiguration.Q Difficulties and risks The partial reconfiguration of FPGA is obtained while circumventing usual FPGA design tools, so that we may face some unexpected behaviour of a new version of design tools.Q Position in the networkThis approach advantageously targets access network as well as end user platform. It is applied here at the PHY layer, but could be generalized to application layers for instance.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenCombined with the demonstration of the pertinence of a NoC approach for SDR SoCs, this approach proves that FPGA PR is worth as an enabling technology for SDR. It brings the flexibility of the SW to the HW, which gives an amazing combination of processing power and reconfigurability.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityThe  demo aims  at  being  integrated  to  a  larger  demo including  a  flexible  RF at  one  side,  and MACRLC layer at the other side.Q Demotrial scenarios A video transmission is operated through a baseband BB MCCDMA link digital only. The noise level on the link may be changed by a cursor. The demo starts with good SNR conditions so that a high data rate may be transmitted. The constellation mapper has a 16QAM configuration, and the convolutional coder has a  rate. The SNR is then decreased by increasing the noise on the link. Some error occurs on the video reception. A GUI permits to reconfigure both mapper and encoder at the transmitter  side  as  well  as  their  corresponding  element  at  the  receiver  side.  A more  robust transmission is obtained, and video transmission occurs now with no error any more.Q What has been developed by the project added value  Whats new HW, SW, proof of conceptThis is a completely new demo that proves the relevance of the heterogeneous NoC architecture of the  FAUST  SoC  for  SDR  PHY  processing  a  worstcase  reconfiguration  between  completely different applications i.e. including RX demapping table takes less than 60s.The partial reconfiguration of FPGA is a novelty, both at the concept and the implementation levels. This demo is the most advanced demo on PR in the SDR community. This demo also combines 2 very promising approaches for future multistandard and reconfigurable systems flexible Network on Chip and FPGA PR. An extension of the NoC network has been developed in order to combine both techniques in a unique environment.Q HW and SW descriptionThis demo is definitely realtime. It is the goal of such a BB demo.Q What are the evaluation criteria of the demosVideo transmission quality is the subjective criteria of evaluation of the success of the demo.Q What added value, coming from the IP, is involved in the demotrial Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 1798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q How do we take  advantage of  the  new features  developed  in  the  different  projects  What  is  the relevance for a global WWI demo3.3.2Demo on reconfigurable components and systems 1Q Title and descriptionThis demo presents a fully reconfigurable multistandard analogtodigital converter ADC chip for wireless receivers and is called Reconfigurable MultiStandard AnalogtoDigital Converter Chip for Wireless Receivers. As analog hardware is generally seen as an impediment to reconfigurability and its reduction a desirable outcome in the quest for SDR and CR, high performance multimode ADCs have become an enabling component to this end.Q HypothesisIt is assumed that the ADC will be combined with a directconversion RF receiver frontend.Q Simplifications, restrictionsResolution and bandwidth are restricted to 14.5bit and 20MHz, respectively. However, this is sufficient to cover the most popular cellular and WLAN standard. Concepts for CR have been presented as well.Q Demotrial roadmap  current state 0106 Concepts for reconfigurable RF transceivers 0307 Presentation of a multimode  modulator during the Audit 2007 in Paris 1007  modulator integrated into a fully reconfigurable ADC chipQ Difficulties and risks Specifications  correspond  to  the  stateoftheart  and  were  difficult  to  achieve.  After  a  second integration, the measurements were successful. Q Position in the networkThe analog IQ baseband input signals are assumed to be provided by a RF receiver frontend. The digital output data of the ADC chip can then be further processed by the digital baseband chip. Q Goal, what is expected to be provenAn ADC concept for SDRCR is presented.  A highperformance reconfigurable multimode ADC at baseband maximized reconfigurability of SDR RF receivers by shifting the channel selection to the digital frontend DFE.The performance  of  the  implemented  multimode  ADC is  comparable  to  the  best  singlestandard solutions. A flexible digital interface allows programming for different standards onthefly.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityThere are the following physical interfaces Analog IQ baseband signal from RF frontend Digital output data to baseband chip SPIinterface for programming of the chipQ Demotrial scenarios In   the  demo,  the  analog  input  signal  is  provided  by  a  measurement  instrument.  Performance  is evaluated using a logic analyzer to sample the digital output data. Q What has been developed by the project added value  Whats new HW, SW, proof of conceptThis year, the first multimode ADCs covering cellular and WLAN have been presented.

In order  to  allow the  eventual  use  of  standard  components  and  thus  get  some  testing  support  the implementation of a core framework basing on the OMG Software Radio Specification has been chosen. For the validation of the installation and reconfiguration process an according graphical user interface has been developed and a video stream used for visual validation. In addition the portability of the concept is proved by integration on two different HW platforms.Q HypothesisBaseband processing resources and according microFramework is limited to GPP and DSP platforms only, not extended to FPGAs and ASICs. Control and GUI on PC connected via TCPIP.Q Simplifications, restrictionsAs full implementation of a radio standard would have exceeded the time and effort frame of a research project,  an application has been selected for implementation,  where one or more video streams pass different processing resources and the according interfaces like a radio data stream would do. This application allows a visible impression of the application.

This  architecture  enables  to  share  the  physical  layer  between  several  users  as  several DataBridges can be deployed. The scenario is comprised by the following steps The RAT is deployed with one DataBridge. A request for a new user user1 arrives. The VideoLAN control finds out that a DataBridge is available and connects user1 to the RAT. A request for another user user2 arrives. The VideoLAN control decides that a new Data Bridge is required and triggers the control application in order to load and connect the new Data Bridge. Once this is done, user2 is connected to the physical layer already in use without affecting the user1.Q What has been developed by the project added value  Whats new HW, SW, proof of conceptControl IF basing on the OMG SW Radio Specification implemented for base station policy editor, XML parser for RAT deployment.

The terminal discovers the available networks through the following procedure1. A simple scanning procedure takes place and all available RATs are retrieved2. Each RAT profile and corresponding policy rules are discovered through the CPC.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 2198Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M243. User  and  terminal  specific  information  user  profile,  terminal  profile,  user  preferences, manufacturer policies are retrieved from the devices cache4. The state of the device CPU, Memory   is retrieved5. A decision making procedure takes place which results in the RAT to connect.As soon as the terminal is attached to the network GPRS, the RMP entity managing the network is informed  that  the  specific  user  with  the  specific  handset  has  been  connected.  The  user,  upon connecting, initiates a service i.e. preinstalled or downloaded and requests something which is poorly supported by GPRS i.e. streaming video. The service adaptation module upon detecting the inability to meet the QoS requirements of the service trigger the decision making module. The latter, after reviewing the user preferences, the service requirements and the cached information of the first step decides to perform a handover to a nearby WLAN. Meanwhile,  the  device  manufacturer inserts a new software update. The latter  is  a  component  for  a  protocol  already  installed  in  the device and used in broadband networks UDT. RMP broadcasts this information to the connected device  after  reviewing  its  classmark  level.  The  mobile,  downloads  it  and  a  protocol  stack reconfiguration procedure takes place. A simple illustration of the demonstration testbed is presented in the following figure. Figure 33.

Further study should focus on the interfaces of each projects trials and demonstrations.3.3.5Efficient control and implementation of reconfigurations  SCTPbased handover Q Title and descriptionSCTPbased  handover  demo  aimed  at  demonstrating  multihoming  capabilities  bandwidth aggregation and mobility of terminals having several network interfaces E2RD5.3Q HypothesisTerminals having several  network interfaces including wireless network interfaces are capable of using several of them at the same time without suffering too much from radio interferencesQ Simplifications, restrictionsDemo to be run on laptopsQ Demotrial roadmap  current stateThe demo runs on laptops Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 2398Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q Difficulties and risks Modifications done on an old kernel have to be ported to a newer kernel may lead to compatibility issuesQ Position in the networkThe whole solution requires software entities in both terminals and application server. Indeed, since SCTP is an endtoend protocol, the application server has to support SCTP modification of the way the server application  typically a web server  opens a socket. Same for the client application in addition to having its kernel implementation modified to support enhanced SCTP features such as bandwidth aggregation, mobility the client application has to me modified to use SCTP instead of TCP or UDP.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenThe goal is to demonstrate the ability to benefit from the plurality of network interfaces to provide a better service to a user by increasing the bandwidth thanks to aggregation and support the mobility across heterogeneous networks.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityThe  prototype  provides  an  interface  to  allow  an  external  entity  to  dynamically  modify  a  SCTP association regarding what network interfaces should be used in the association. Intelligence from an external entity can thus drive the modification of the terminal strategy.Q Demotrial scenarios The scenario is that one mobile terminal having two WIFI interfaces wants to download a file from a Web Server.  The network environment  is  made of  two WIFI  access  points.  At  the  beginning the terminal is only under the coverage of one access point and starts downloading the file at the rate of 11 Mbs. The user moves around and enters the coverage of the second access point what triggers the connection of his second WIFI interface to this second access point. The IP address the terminal gets from this  new AP is added to the running SCTP association. The file download data rate rises to 22Mbs. As the mobile terminal continues to move away from the first AP, it leaves the coverage of this AP. Thus, the IP address corresponding to this AP is removed from the SCTP association. The file download data rate falls to 11 Mbs as a consequence. A picture explaining the demonstration context and scenario is shown below.Figure 35.

Hence HSDPA coreaccess network, Service Platform and end user have been employed for this purpose.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenUsing dedicated CPC channel, optimization of resources e.g. load on network and end user side can be ensured while simultaneously delivering better service to the end user.

Q How do we take  advantage of  the  new features  developed  in  the  different  projects  What  is  the relevance for a global WWI demoOne way of integration of present demo into global one would be to use generic entities like CPC ServerPolicy Server, CPC client which are independent of access technology. Further studying about details  of  CPC  channel  used,  its  constraints  and  scenarios  targeted  i.e  using  load,  mobilityno coverage low signal level would help in better integration of present demo.The ultimate  goal of the E2R project  and especially of  the proof of  concept  workpackage WP8 is  to provide  one  global  or  a  few integrated  demos,  mainly  comprising  cooperation  andor  amendments  to existing prototyping activities. The integration will be performed through the RPE mentioned above. To this effect, two integrated demos have been identified and will be improved to be presented in the final project audit review in March 2008. In both cases the integration of the demos is assisted by the E2R Demo 7 on CPC prototype implementation. The description of the integratein demos according to the common set of criteria follows3.3.7Integrated Demo 1 DNPMASMREMSFBS Q Title and description The Integrated Demo1 consists in the unification of the previously described E2R Demos 3, 4 and 7.

The  Dynamic  Network  Planning  and  ManagementAdvanced  Spectrum  Management DNPMASM demonstrator is  part  of  the  E2R activities  towards  validating  Enhanced  Radio Resource  and  Spectrum  Efficiency  mechanisms  and  is  mobilized  in  order  to  support  the management of heterogeneous reconfigurable infrastructures.The Reconfigurable Equipment Management System REMS prototype aims at obtaining proof of  concept  by  validating  and  demonstrating  mechanisms  for  the  selection  of  the  optimum reconfiguration actions by the mobile terminal.Finally, regarding the E2R2 Flexible Base Station FBS demonstrator, the intention is to define and develop innovative concepts that support new base station architectures able to operate a large range of radio standards which may be placed  in cooperation with an appropriate configurable RFfrontend    at  virtually  every  frequency  band.  Moreover,  advanced  concepts  for  the implementation, installation and reconfiguration of RAT applications in a Base Station and the way from legacy software in base stations to a flexible RAT processing are also showcased.In the E2R Integrated Demo 1, network management functionality via DNPMASM is applied in legacy network elements, as well as in an FBS, which offers the capability of software enabled RAT reconfiguaton.  Decisions made in the network are  conveyed  via  policies  in  the terminal management block REMS to assist the final RAT selection by the terminal. The demonstrated terminal side comprises a NOKIA 770 device internet tablet httpwww.europe.nokia.com. Q HypothesisThe main assumptions and preconditions regarding this demo can be summarized as follows Each cell will be covered from reconfigurable transceivers. Each terminal is considered to be a reconfigurable device implementing the network decisions policies.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 2798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 The service area will  be consisted only from two overlapped cells  in order to ensure the guarantee the be clear what exactly happens during the demo.Q Simplifications, restrictionsThe network traffic, when needed, will derive from a traffic generator in order to simulate the context of the service area. The selection of RATs is restricted by the implemented technologies in the  HW  parts  of  the  demo,  e.g.  1  the  Nokia  device  only  supports  WLAN  and  Bluetooth connectivity at the moment, thus imposing an important restriction of not including other RAT types  into  the  demonstrations  2  the FBS assumes the existence  if  a  802.16type  RAT and a UMTS RAT.Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateThe roadmap towards the current state of the Integrated Demo 1 during the E2R pahse 2 is as follows Preliminary versions of the nonintegrated demos of DNPMASM, REMS and FBS have been presented during the annual EU project review in March 2007..  IST Mobile Summit 2007 In the IST Summit, held in Budapest, an integrated version of DNPMASM  and  REMS  were  demonstrated  See  Demos  4  in  Section  3.3. Additionally, the FBS demo was also presented by its own See Demo 3 in Section 3.3  SDR Forum  November 07 Demonstration of the REMS prototype during the SDRF technical conference WWI Inovation Day  November 2007 The DNPMASMREMS prototype  has been demonstrated during presented in WWI Innovation in Brussels on November 13th.  The final  demonstration is  expected to be ready for the overall  EU project  review in March 2008. In this final version, DNPMASM, REMS and FBS will be fully integrated.Q Difficulties and risks The limited memory capacity of the terminal for the development of REMS software causes some instability problems. The REMS software, which has been developed, based on CC Maemo in order to be ported to NOKIA 770 device, had to be carefully designed and many tests have been performed in order to check its stability and robustness.Q Position in the networkDNPMASM is a network management entity. It is located to the network side and its target is to find the optimum network configuration. REMS is located to the terminal side and its purpose is to implement the reconfiguration policies sent by DNPMASM. FBS is a set of transceivers acting as reconfigurable network access points for the terminals.  The target of FBS is to implement the policies sent by DNPMASM regarding its transceivers.

Integrated Demo 1 position in the neworkQ Goal, what is expected to be provenThe goal is to validate the efficiency of the proposed dynamic network planning and management functionality in conjunction with a the respective terminal management functionality as and b the conveyance of policies through the cognitive pilot channel acting as a radio enabler and c the inclusion of real HWSW reconfigurable platforms FBS.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityInputs  OutputsThe input for DNPMASM will be provided from the traffic generator. More specifically the input will be the total number of users and for each user will be provided the following information the allocated transceiver and RAT the requested service the current QoS level the user profileFurthermore the capabilities of each transceiver will be available as well as the network operator policies. The output of DNPMASM will  be the reconfiguration policies for each terminal and transceiver.The input of the FBS is the policy decision from DNPMASM which is the new operating RAT and frequency band. Accordingly, the terminal will receive through CPC the policy decision from DNPM ASM which is the new transceiver and RAT that the terminal should be allocated and the new QoS level.InterfacesThree interfaces where implemented for this demo1.

Illustration of Integrated Demo 1 scenario Q What has been developed by the project  added value  whats new  HW  SW  proof of concept New management functionality components were developed for both the network and terminal sides. Moreover, their efficiency has been validated through both PClaptop based equipment on the one side and also through real equipment such as the NOKIA Internet Tablet device on the other side. Of high importance is also the investigation of  the implementation, installation and reconfiguration of RAT applications in a Flexible Base Station. Specifically, of great value is the way that has been followed in order to migrate from the case with bounded softwarehardware processing resources in a fixed and unflexible  manner to the gradual  software replacement  of certain  processing  resources.  This  will  finally  result  in  software  solution  that  allows  for reassignment of a radio link to an arbitrary chosen RAT, the reconfiguration of used frequency bands and the additionremoval of supported RATs on demand.Q HW and SW descriptionHardware Nokia 770 Tablet terminal FBS hardware processing unitsSoftware FBS software processing units REMS module C DNPMASM module Java Traffic generator Java  Database MySqlDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3098Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q What are the evaluation criteria of the demosThe evaluation criteria for this demo are associated with a the increase of performance achieved by applying the network management schemes to reconfigurable elements b the fewer number of reconfigurable  access  points  needed  to  support  a  specific  load  in  comparison  to  legacy infrastructures, c the response time of the reconfiguration action in the SWHW based FBS d the increase of obtained QoS levels per user e the processing time for the management optimization engines network and terminal to derive to reconfiguration decisions Q What added value coming from the IP is involved in the demotrial The  Integrated  Demo  1  addresses  mechanisms  for  network  and  terminal  equipment reconfiguration management and control, and provides some first evidence and proof of concept for the validation of these mechanisms. It showcases novel algorithmic functionality with respect to  a  dynamic  network  planning  and  management  for  network  segments  that  comprise reconfigurable FBS implemented within E2R together with legacy elements and also are capable of  operating  in  multiple  frequency  bands  b  reconfigurable  terminal  equipment  management functionality that is used in order to achieve always best connected terminals. It also demonstrates and promotes the beneficial  use of a  Cognitive Pilot  Channel,  major  achievement of the E2R project.Q How do we take advantage of the new features developed in the different projects And relevance for a global WWI demoBoth  DNPMASM  and  REMS demonstrated  functionalities  require  input  relevant  to  specific serviceuser  profiles  in  order  for  their  algorithmic  engine  to  be  properly  executed.  As  such SPICEMobiLife proposals with respect to the deployment of new applications and services based on  the  evolving  capabilities  of  3G  systems  and  beyond  could  also  be  taken  into  account. Furthermore, new WINNER RAT technology could be one of the candidate RATs to be deployed by  various  network  elements,  including  FBS,  and  also  candidate  to  be  selected  during  the networkterminal decision process.3.3.8Integrated Demo 2 DNPMASMCRRMRT EMULATOR TML ApplicationQ Title and description The Integrated Demo 2 consists in the unification of the previously described E2R Demos 4, 7 and of the additional  components Common Radio Resource  Management CRRM and Real Time Emulator RTE that have been used in past demonstration activities for E2R. The purpose of this demo is to demonstrate the adaptation of a streaming application on the terminal according to the network policies sent by DNPMASM by also showing  all the necessary actions that should take place in order to keep the QoS in the best possible level while trying to adapt to the external stimuli. RTE is an emulator that reproduces in a realistic way a B3G heterogeneous radio access network, that include three RATs, UTRA, GERAN, WLAN. RTE incorporates the capacity to evaluate the QoS experienced by the user when using real applications under controlled conditions of the used RAT and the Core Network.Q Hypothesis A streaming application will be active during the demo. WLAN and HSDPA RATs will be availableQ Simplifications, restrictions The terminal mobility will be simulated. The terminal will be served from the WLAN access point at the initialization of the demo.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3198Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateThe roadmap towards the current state of the Integrated Demo 2 during the E2R phase 2 is as follows Standalone  versions  of  DNPMASM  and  RTE  as  well  as  an  integrated  version  of DNPMASM and CRRM have been presented during the annual EU project review in March 2007. IST  Mobile  Summit  2007  In  the  IST  Summit,  held  in  Budapest,  DNPMASM  was demonstrated  integrated  with  terminal  modules.  Additionally,  the  SCTPbased Handover demo was also presented by its own. WWI Inovation Day  November 2007 The DNPMASM prototype has been demonstrated in WWI Innovation in Brussels on November 13th.  The final demonstration is expected to be ready for the overall EU project review in March 2008.Q Difficulties and risks The simulation  of  the  terminal  mobility  effects  may be represented  either  by unplugging  the WLAN access point or by changing several performance parameters like bit error rate, throughput etc. It is assumed that the terminal will be initially served from the WLAN access point and that is the only available connection for the DNPMASM to send its policy about the terminal. If the WLAN access  point  will  be  unplugged in  order  to  simulate  the fact  that  the terminal  moved outside the range of WLAN there will be no connection between the terminal and DNPMASM in order the reconfiguration decision to be sent. A better way for this mobility simulation would be the development of a WLAN access point management module in order to have the completely control of the context parameters sent to DNPMASM. Thus, the performance parameters will be easily changed and the connection would be still available for DNPMASM to send its decision.Q Position in the networkCRRM  collects  information  about  the  context  of  the  service  area.  DNPMASM  needs  this information as input for the proper execution of the optimization algorithm.DNPMASM is a network management entity. It is located to the network side and its target is to find the optimum network configuration.The purpose of the terminal is to implement the network policies sent by DNPMASM and show the changes to quality of the streaming application.RTE emulates  the  RATs  operating  inside  the  network  service  area  as  well  as  the  terminal connections with the core network.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenThe integrated demo 2 exhibits the level of adaptability that the technological features aroused within E2R, offer to a streaming application, thus resulting to keeping the provided QoS in the best possible levels.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityThe input for DNPMASM will be provided both from the CRRM and the network database. More specifically the input will be the total number of users and for each user will  be provided the following information the allocated transceiver and RAT the requested service the current QoS level the user profile performance parametersFurthermore the capabilities of each transceiver will be available as well as the network operator policies. The output of DNPMASM will be the reconfiguration policies for each terminal and transceiver.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3298Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The input of the terminal is the policy decision from DNPMASM which is the new transceiver and RAT that the terminal should be allocated and the new QoS level.Q Demotrial scenarios The steps for the scenario are the following1. CRRM sends parameters both for WLAN and HSDPA2. DNPMASM periodically calculates and checks the corresponding KPIs3. The terminal moves outside the range of WLAN4. DNPMASM decides that a reconfiguration should take place5. DNPMASM sends a handoff to the terminal from WLAN to HSDPA6. The terminal proceeds to reconfiguration procedure7. After a while the HSDPA is overloaded8. DNPMASM checks again KPIs9. DNPMASM decides for a second handoff from RTE10. The terminal proceeds to reconfiguration procedure Q What has been developed by the project added value  Whats new HW, SW, Proof of conceptIn the framework of E2R, a novel algorithmic functionality for dynamic network planning and management  has  been  developed.  Part  of  the  functionality  is  demonstrated  through  the DNPMASM  demo.  DNPMASM  refers  to  newly  developed  management  functionality  for heterogeneousreconfigurable elements. DNPMASM can be implemented in both distributed way, by embedding the respective algorithm in the element, and as part of the legacy OM schemes. Q HW and SW descriptionHardware WLAN access point LinksysSoftware DNPMASM tool Java CRRM Postgresql Database Terminal Streaming application Network Database MySql RTE EmulatorQ What are the evaluation criteria of the demosThis demo demonstrates how the modules can work together so as for the terminal to be able to always operate in the best possible configuration and to be adaptive to the network changes. As a result, the user satisfaction increases as long as this transparent operation guaranties the highest possible QoS level to the users.Q What added value, coming from the IP, is involved in the demotrial Demonstrated  E2R  adaptability  that  dynamically  tackles  with  a  frequently  variant  and  more complex future wireless environment..Q How do we take advantage of the new features developed in the different projects What is the relevance for a global WWI demoTo be specified 3.4MobiLifeSummary of the projectThe strategic goal of MobiLife is to bring advances in mobile applications and services within the reach of users    focusing  especially  on  families    in  their  everyday  life  by  innovating  and  deploying  new applications and services based on the evolving capabilities of 3G systems and beyond.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3398Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The  research  challenge of  MobiLife  is  to  address  the multidimensional  diversity  in  enduser  devices, available networks, interaction modes, applications, and services. To deal with this complexity and reach its strategic goal, the MobiLife Project researches contextawareness, privacy and trust, adaptation, semantic interoperability, and their embodiment in novel services and applications that match key use scenarios of endusers everyday life. MobiLife addresses both technological and societal impact by addressing the technical viability and useracceptance of solutions that belong to three main Focus Areas Selfawareness  provides support for automatic configuration arrangement of devices, services, and local connectivity in the users local environment. It also enables automatic and multimodal interfaces that enhance the user experience and minimized the active user effort needed in managing the local environment. Technically this Focus Area addresses multiple devices, multiple interaction modalities, and multiple configurations. Groupawareness comprises context and presence support enabling individuals to relate to, share, and interact with each other and common artefacts. Also novel privacy and trust models are addressed, which are mandatory for users to be able to rely on and use these new services and applications. Technically this Focus Area addresses multiple groups that a user needs to interact with, multiple roles that  the user  plays in these groups, multiple models and degrees of trust  and privacy that  will  be required. Worldawareness offers  automatic  support  for  seamless  access  to and delivery of  services  across different domains that enable individuals to retain the accustomed use of their services, as they move between different environments and infrastructures. Technically this Focus Area addresses multiple potentially interesting services and data sources, multiple actors of varying degrees of trustworthiness providing these, multiple kinds and formats of information available.MobiLife research is divided into four Work Areas  Usercentricity Requirements for Mobile Users and Basic Business Models  Services and applications Service Probes for Families and Individuals Architectures  and  technologies  Basic  Architecture,  Personalization,  Privacy    Trust, Context Management and  Evaluation Service Trials.The usercentric approach has been applied in the MobiLife research and development work in the iterative way, as illustrated in the picture below.The research cycle, which was preceded by the creation of the highlevel vision in the very beginning of the Project, has consisted of the following steps 1 Usage Scenarios creation, 2 Services  Applications Research and Development in parallel  with the Enabling Technologies Research and Development,  3 Integration of the results from the previous step, and 4 Evaluation of the results. After each cycle the objectives have been revised,  and the results  more refined.  For instance,  the results of the Services  Applications Research and Development work of the first cycle were mockups, whereas the next cycles have been more and more comprehensive probes, till the final implementations that have been integrated in the service trials with real users.The results of the Project work have been demonstrated to the public audience in different demonstration events, and have been consolidated in a user trial during the final phase of the project.

It  has  to  be  noted, however, that most of the remarks apply to all the trials performed.3.4.1Personal Context Communicator trialQ Title and description The Personal Context Communicator is an application integrated for the trial in Turin Italy. It is a framework  application  including  Communication  Context  Management,  Context  Watcher  basic characteristics, Personal Context Monitoring HeartPod, and Proactive Service Portal.Communication  Context  Management  allows  the  user  to  configure  hisher  communication preferences according to the context. For the trial this has been limited to the SMS service.Context Watcher is one of the MobiLife applications. It allows visualising on the device a number of context information on the user. In addition it allows the user to see the context of hisher buddies, and it allows the user to give permission to hisher buddies to see information on hisher context. Context  Watcher  is,  in  addition,  an  enabler  for  Communication  Context  Management  and  for Proactive Service Portal.Personal Context Monitoring HeartPod provides visualisation on the user device, and allows for visualisation  by authorised  third  parties,  of  the  user  ECG and acceleration  parameter,  using  data coming from sensors on the body of the user.Proactive Service Portal allows user to receive information about available services in a context aware manner. Context awareness includes also information learned about service usage in similar contextual situation.Q HypothesisNo  specific  preconditions  were  given  to  the  trial  users.  The  users  had  been  registered  with  the MobiLife system, so they are MobiLife users and a profile exists.Q Simplifications, restrictionsA key part of the application is the Communication Context Management. This feature allows the user to configure his  communication  services  calls,  videocalls  and data namely SMS to  be context aware.  During  the  trial  only  the  SMS  context  management  was  performed,  as  call  context management  would  require  access  to  the  Call  Control  functions  in  the  network,  which  was  not provided.Also for the Proactive Service Portal, available services were predefined to a selected set that had been specified according to the MobiLife ontology.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateThe picture below gives an overall view of the Project, highlighting the main milestones towards the realization of the trials.After six months the first mockups were evaluated and the specifications for the initial applications probes were defined. Applications Probes 1 were ready at the end of the first project year,  while Probes 2 were made available in the mid of the 2nd project year.Probes 2, with refinementsimprovements  were used in the trial  integration phase. The trials took place in the final months of the 2nd project year.Q Difficulties and risks For the trials, most of the difficulties and risks concerned the timely availability of the integrated environment  and the  stability  of  the applications,  considering that  the users  were free  to  use  the applications in a noncontrolled environment.Q Position in the networkThe MobiLife trials are not focused on network or platform functions. The trials were application trials  and oriented to  a user  evaluation of the applications,  as  the final  step of the User  Centred Designed that has been applied throughout the project. In the trials there were no simulated parts. One of the issues was content, therefore for some applications, content has been created and described specifically for the trials.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenObjective of the trial was the evaluation from the user point of view of the services and applications developed. In addition, the trials allowed a validation of the overall architecture and approach of the project.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityMost of the services are accessed via web interfaces, covering therefore most of the interoperability problems. Q Demotrial scenarios Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The trials were performed with real users, which were trained on the use of the applications, but then developed their own use cases.The scenario illustrated below is therefore only an example of the possible scenarios of use of the application. The scenario was in fact used for internal purpose within the project to illustrate the main characteristics of the applications. It  was also used to derive use cases for the training of the trial usersPersonal Context Communicator Alice in MobiLand Alice has her Personal Context Communicator on the PDA and she is going to begin her working day with a meeting out of the company The evening before,  she had forgotten to change her presence for the current day and for her buddy list in any case, the system understands automatically that her context is not the usual one for an office day and it changes her contextual presence as outofoffice In the different moments of the day, she has either only the PDA on fullmobility or the laptop on as well it will be easy for colleagues andor friends of her buddy list to understand by which devicesservices she will be reachable call, videocall, sms, file sharing, email, . At the same time, Alice will always be able to see her contextaware buddy list, which will show, during the working day,  in the first  position the colleagues group the single  elements,  followed by the folder of the friends group and vice versa after the working time in any case, it will always be Alice  to  choose  which  contact  she  wants  to  check.By the accelerometer linked to her PDA, then, it will be easy for colleaguesfriends to know when it is possible to disturb her, because it will be known her mobility status, too, that is stationary, walking, travelling, etc  In her buddy list, she always has her grandmother, both because the latter always wants to know where she is and what she is doing and because Alice, as well, wants to check often the heartrate of her granny In the evening,  after  the working day,  Alice will  easily organize  the outing together  with her friends, both by her buddy list always updated and by switching to TimeGems application, if she needs advice for a better organization of her and her friends spare timeQ What has been developed by the project added value  Whats new HW, SW, proof of conceptThe project has developed the overall architectural approach as well as the specific applications. Both aspects architecture as well as the specific applications have been tested and evaluated within the course of the trials. Most projects results are therefore in terms of SW modules.Q HW and SW descriptionThe picture below shows the setting of the testbed for the trial.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 3898Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q What are the evaluation criteria of the demosBoth  trials  and  demos  have  been  evaluated  with  criteria  mostly  related  to  market  and  business potential, as well as user acceptance.A technical evaluation of the project results has been conducted as well, according to the following dimensions Ease to implement applications, Exploitability of components functionality, Testability, Impact on network architecture and terminals, and Evolvability.Q What added value, coming from the IP, is involved in the demotrial The main added value is,  of  course,  in  the applications themselves  that  are  the key focus of  the project. From a technical point of view the architecture, and the enablers required for the support of the applications, are also the key results of the project that have been tested in the trials.Q How do we take  advantage of  the  new features  developed  in  the  different  projects  What  is  the relevance for a global WWI demoThe most relevant feature for a global demo can be found in the advanced service scenarios, which having been tested by the users,  have relevance also with regard to aspects related to market and business. The additional contribution is the architecture of MobiLife with the developed enablers.3.4.2Integrated FamilyMapsNote Previous  description covers all  the proposed criteria.  This  second demotrial  only highlights  the specific differences, referring to previous section for all the common aspects.Q Title and description The Integrated FamilyMaps is an application demonstrated in the trial in Helsinki Finland.

It  was also used to derive use cases for the training of the trial usersIntegrated FamilyMaps The Housefathers Lasse browses FamilyMaps at home and notices a new special offer of new XBOX game in the local shop. Its interesting but doesnt demand immediate actions. Lasse leaves for a walk with his baby. He attaches FamilyMaps into the baby pram. Context watcher tracks down Lasses movements and heart rate so that later he can check if he has been true to his training schedules. This way also Lisa can be virtually present even though shes working at the office. When  Lasse  gets  close  to  the  shop,  he  receives  a  notification  of  the  same  special  offer FamilyMaps beeps and sends vibration alert to the handlebar Lasse buys the game, but also notices that the new PS3 hit game has arrived here as well. Lasse doesnt own this game console, but he wants to tell about this to his friend Harri. Since there seem to be only few items left in the store he doesnt want to inform everybody and thus Lasse allows access to this Pointofinterest only to Harri. Harri is at home cooking the dinner. His FamilyMaps application beebs, but he is unable to check the message. Once the food is ready Harri has time to check the message. He isnt too excited about the new PS3 game, but none the less he lets the PointofInterest stay on his map.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 4098Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 Next to this new PoI there is a photo taken earlier by Harri.

The key SPICE project objectives are  Provide a unified and seamless way to deliver services over heterogeneous execution platforms, network and terminals. Enrich the service landscape, through an overlay structure offering a personalized user experience anytime, anyplace. Create a trusted and open platform that will  simplify the use of services and devices through personalization and customization. Openup to new business models and value chains.  Enabling PanEuropean service provisioning.  Promoting  the  uptake  of  innovative  IT  software  technologies  in  a  telecommunications  grade service platform environment. For users, operators and service providers, the SPICE project will turn todays confusing heterogeneity into an easily manageable and rich service environment by exploiting the diversity of device capabilities and fostering service adoption. The SPICE approach will broaden business opportunities in the communications and associated business sectors. To achieve this ambition, the SPICE consortium integrates the competence and  knowledge  of  leading  European  telecom  operatorsservice  providers  and  key  IT  and telecommunications suppliers.The key SPICE principles are platformcentric approach multiterminal, multiaccess distributed communication sphere open and controlled access new service ecosystem service composability and loosely coupled approach semantic enhancement.The  project  uses  a  platformcentric  architecture  approach  with  a  layered  structure  that  is  typical  for telecommunication  systems.  It  separates  functionality and APIs,  which promotes  ease  of development, portability, and manageability with the price of potentially increased overhead. Above the core networking stack, we have the middleware layer which has four clearly defined sublayers focusing on the core aspects of  the  distributed  service  execution  environment,  namely  the  Capabilities  and  Enablers  Layer,  the Component Service Layer, the Knowledge Layer, and the Value Added Service VAS Layer. In addition, the platform features  a  Mediation and Exposure  layer  that  is  used to  interface  external  platforms and resources. This virtual layer is realized using the functionality of the other layers, namely the component service layer.The architecture is based on components, which are discovered, federated, combined, and executed in a distributed environment. The SPICE project platform consists of four different kinds of components. The Basic  Components  are  generic  building  blocks  that  take  advantage  of  the  SPICE  project  platform features. Resource Adapters are special basic components, which act as proxies to components in legacy Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 4298Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24systems.  Components  that  support  interfaces  from  the  knowledge  framework  are  called  Intelligent Components. Both may further be used to create Value Added Service VAS components and composite VAS components. The composite components may be created and adapted at runtime by using realtime information provided by various knowledge sources.Figure 39  Overview of SPICE platform architectureFigure 39 presents an overview of the SPICE architecture. Blue layers constitute the SPICE platform which is built on Capabilities and Enablers layer.The terminal platform is presented on the left of the Figure 313 and the serverside distributed platform on the right. Both the terminal and the serverside system have a layered structure.Structure of the projectThe project is broken down into nine main technical activities workpackages WP1 to WP9 and one project management task WP0. Each workpackage is representative of a major effort and is divided into several tasks, including a workpackage coordination task.

M4M24 Developments of the platform enablers. M24M30 Demonstration and validation of the developments.Demonstration activities in SPICEDemonstration  activities  of  the  SPICE project  are  concentrated  in  WP8    Experiencing  SPICE.  The objectives of this WP are to validate the development and the integration of the components in the Service Platform SP using a technical and business approach. During the final months of the project, WP8 should be able to show an integrated platform prototype with implemented services capable to show the most important functionalities of the platform .In fact  one out  of  four  WP8 tasks  is  responsible  for  integration  of  Service  Platform components  and implementation of demonstration scenarios Task T8.3  Experience Integration. Each of technical work packages WP1  WP7 is ended with an integration task where a validation of results, achieved in previous tasks,  is  done  using  mockups  and  software  implementations.  These  tasks  contribute  directly  to  the integrated demonstrator of the project  WP8 T8.3.Trials are not planned in SPICE. It is planned to prepare proofofconcept demonstration at the end of the project. However, an interaction with real users took place two times to date in the project lifecycle. Those activities were related with evaluation of scenarios and components.At M24 SPICE project already possesses a set of mature demos that are able to show key functionalities of SPICE platform. After setting up a distributed testbed particular demonstrations will be enriched by some platform aspects.  They will  be  connected  on  the  top  level  by a  Common SPICE scenario  defined  in deliverable D1.5 Refined Requirements and scenariosSPD1.5. Final demonstration showing SPICE as a unified service platform is intended to be delivered at M30.Process of creation of Common SPICE scenario was complex and took over 20 months of the project lifecycle to complete. At the beginning of the project, requirements and scenarios Intelligent Portal, Etourism, Eemergency were defined respectively in deliverables D1.1 User, enterprise, technical and open market  business  requirements    SPD1.1  and   D1.2 Scenarios  for  the representative next  generation communication and information services SPD1.2. After a few months scenarios were evaluated by endusers and professionals from three countries Poland, Spain and Italy. Enduser oriented meetings were mostly dedicated to the discussion of SPICEenabled services from a consumer    citizen  point  of  view,  trying  to  elicit  respondents  opinion  about  potential  benefits  and disadvantages of what was shown in the stories. Professionalsoriented meetings concentrated instead on the  process  of  creating,  delivering  and  managing  these  services,  with  special  attention  to  design, development and prototyping issues. In this case, potential benefits and disadvantages were examined as well. Results of interviews were gathered in deliverable D8.1 Pioneering SPICE project. A view by focus groups from the fields of IPortal, eTourism and eEmergency Services SPD8.1.Then scenarios  were  refined  by WP8 deliverable  D8.2    An indepth  view on  SPICE project,  using Intelligent Portal, eTourism and eEmergency scenarios based on feedback from focus groups and from the business analysis made in D1.4.  First of all, it was necessary to transform the information coming from T8.1 to provide an instrument to perform accurate and objective changes on the scenarios. In this way, it was  decided  to  process  the  information  in  three  steps  in  which  the  transformation  went  from general recommendations and suggestions to specific and accurate requirements for the original requirements in Deliverable  1.2  SPD1.2.  Thanks  to  this  approach,  a  set  of  Scenes  Requirements  for  each  of  the scenarios were obtained. This allowed proceeding with the first enhancement taking into account the users feedback.However, feedback concerning the scenarios was also collected from the different work packages analysis of available mockups and also from the business analysis made in D1.4 Obviously, it needed a different kind of processing since that feedback had a direct reference to the original scenes in scenarios. Therefore, Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 4598Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24it was just necessary to identify which were scenes used for both mockups and business analysis, extract their relevant input and eventually transform that information into real Scenes Requirements. Once these requirements were obtained, changes were applied to the original scenarios SPD8.2. In deliverable D1.5 Revised Requirements and Scenarios scenarios were processed in order to be more readable shorter version, stick to SPICE main features and to the work carried by technical work packages and finally reflect what will be available as demonstrators. This new SPICE global storyline Common SPICE scenario should be considered as a reference by technical work packages in the future, in particular for demo purposes SPD1.5. Demonstrations available at current stage of the project after nearly 2 years of duration are described below. 3.5.1Demonstration of the Distributed Communication Sphere DCS Management SystemQ Title and description The  SPICE  project  defines  the  concept  of  Distributed  Communication  Sphere  DCS,  as  the ensemble of communication resources services, devices, networks and buddies available to the user at a given time, forming this users Communication Model.  To manage and maintain this DCS, SPICE Work Package 3 defines the DCS Management System, composed of four components  Terminal Manager, whose role is to synchronize data between the SPICE platform and the user terminal, Resource Discovery System, whose role is to discover and publish information about the resources in a users DCS, Multimodal Delivery and Control System, whose role is to render services user interfaces on the best selection of resources in the users DCS, Dynamic Desktop, which presents a user interface to the services in the DCS under the form of widgets on the users terminal. Q HypothesisAll mentioned SPICE platform components are implemented respectively on the operators and users side. All used technologies have to be supported.Q Simplifications, restrictionsThe presented software may be run on a PC, PocketPC or a J2ME phone Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateDemo was showed during IST Mobile and Wireless Communication Summit in July 2007.Q Difficulties and risks User Data Synchronisation,  because the complexity  of the task,  demands to be automated for full exploitation. Certain constraints imposed by the current user context e.g. network bandwidth or costs should be taken into account.Q Position in the networkAs explained before, SPICE is about service platforms, so the logical place of the demonstration is at application and service platform layers. Hence, we might have an interface with Ambient Networks through their  Ambient  Service Interface.  The position with respect  to the other  projects  remains undecided.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenUser Data Synchronisation The synchronisation of user data in general maintains the coherence of a collection of user data sources e.g. media content, address book, user terminal configuration parameters among a number of user devices.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 4698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Dynamic Service UpdatesDynamic service updates address the need for updates on services and associated widgets on the users terminal based on his current situation, in accordance with the operators service platform. New services may be proposed and non relevant services need to be set passive or even deleted. Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityDynamic Desktop presents a user interface to services in the DCS under the form of widgets on the userss terminal.Rendering  of  service  user  interface  on  the  terminal  device  is  based  on  crossplatform  XML description, allowing for a number of platform implementations currently PC, Pocket PC and J2ME phones.Q Demotrial scenarios Scene 1  Using Dynamic DesktopUpon arrival  in Hungary,  Alain is  proposed a Hungarian News service by the platform contextawareness, user preferences. The proposal is shown in Dynamic Desktop on his device, and Alain accepts it  it is installed as a new widget in the Dynamic Desktop and Alain can use it. Later on, as he is  wandering  in  the  center  of  Budapest,  Alain  browses  available  services  to  install  a  currency converter widget to check on the price of a concert ticket.

On one hand this can provide users with more choices in order to personalize their service interaction experience. On the other hand, it tends to confuse users having to make all device selections by themselves.  It  even could frustrate  them,  while  commuting between different  places  with  their changing  resources.  Modality  Learning  and  Recommendation  supports  the  decision  process  of selecting the right resources, while observing the users behaviour in different contextual situations. The demo showed a website demonstrator which simulates a multimodality communication scenario where the learner and recommender subsystem is present.Q HypothesisModality Learner and Recommender Subsystem implemented on the service platform of the operator.Q Simplifications, restrictionsThe  subsystem  learns  related  knowledge  rules  based  on  the  observation  of  users  previous behaviours,  and  gives  recommendations  about  modalities  to  be  used,  by  applying  the  gained knowledge in the current context. Therefore it saves users time and effort.Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateDemo was showed during WWI Innovation Day in Brussels on 13 November 2007Q Difficulties and risks Implementation of efficient Modality Learner and Recommender Subsystem.Q Position in the networkAs explained before, SPICE is about service platforms, so the logical place of the demonstrations is at application and service platform layers. Hence, we might have an interface with Ambient Networks through their  Ambient  Service Interface.  The position with respect  to the other  projects  remains undecided.Q Goal, what to be provenMain goal of designing the modality learner and recommender subsystem is to release end users from complicated mobile multimodal situations. It learns related knowledge rules based on the observation of users previous behaviours, and gives recommendations about modalities to be used, by applying gained knowledge in the current context.

At each  place,  she  is  using  her  multimodality  enabled  SPICE services,  e.g.  a  movie  service.  In  the demonstrator she can select resources from a  context watcher,  including a list  of available device, modality and network options, for the current situation. By manually triggering the learning process, the  learner will retrieve knowledge association rules about modalities from the users previous behaviour in a defined period.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 5298Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Figure 323  The context watcher, learner and recommenderIn the next step Consuelo asks the Recommender for recommendations by clicking the recommend button. Then the top three recommendations are shown in the recommender view.Once she makes  a  decision,  either  by herself  or  by the  recommender,  the  selected  information is gathered by the system and can be used for learning in future.Figure 324   Learning and recommending3.5.4Demonstration SplitTerminal GBA AuthenticationQ Title and description This demo presents a Firefox extension that allows a user to be authenticated on their PC thanks to their mobile phone connected through Bluetooth.

They are maintained through a widget available on their mobile devices. The ACE has its own analyzing, discovery, search and composition components which allow analyzing a users request, discovering the available services and composing a process out of them that will fulfil the users need.This demonstration looks as followsDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 5598Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The user  expresses  his  request  into  the  best  language  he  knows and uses  every  day  the  natural language.The original user request is analyzed, and the main concepts are extracted from it. These concepts are used by a discovery mechanism that searches in the service directories the right services matching with them. Then, a composition engine assembles the discovered services according to the logic of the request, in order to build a composed service which is deployed and excuted in order to deliver the result to the user.The use of semantics is mandatory to understand the meaning of the original users request. The use of semantics in ACE is made at two levels the main concepts describing the users need are extracted from the request, and these concepts are then searched in some specific structures attached to the service descriptions  those structures are called ontologies the logical grammatical form of the request helps the composition engine to build the exact logic of the final composed service. communication scenario where the learner and recommender subsystem is present.Q HypothesisDeveloper is using Eclipse IDE with SPICE plugin.Q Simplifications, restrictionsThousands  of  services  are  available  in  the  Internet  and accessible  from mobile  devices.  But  it  is difficult for the end user to find and execute the ones he wants, to obtain exactly the final service he wishes.

One easy and applied method of interacting with a computer to build a service is the use of a graphical interface. While a lot of the inner functions of a service are elementary and often the same, a service can be build from basic  elements    the  service  building  blocks.  These  service  building  blocks  just  need to  be arranged and linked to each other according to the desired function of the service. This can be done Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 5798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24easily  through  a  graphical  interface.  Service  building  blocks  can  be  dragged  and  dropped  in  a developer environment. The necessary links between these block can then be easily made by drawing lines between the service building blocks.An important goal is to keep the non technical user away from all technical knowledge so he can concentrate on his idea. For this propose the available service building blocks have to be imported by one  click  from  the  service  execution  environment  running  in  the  background  without  the  users knowing.  Also the  testing should  be  easily  possible  by one click and also the deployment  of  the finished service.Features of the demo graphical service creation, easy to understand interface, import SBB from SEE, import SBB with WSDL file, test service before deploying, deploy services into SEE, eclipse plugin.Q HypothesisDeveloper is using Eclipse IDE with SPICE plugin.Q Simplifications, restrictionsThousands  of  services  are  available  in  the  Internet  and accessible  from mobile  devices.

This will be based on a  single  radio  access  technology with  enhanced capabilities  compared to  existing  systems  or  their evolutions.WINNER II is a continuation of the WINNER I project, which developed the overall system concept. WINNER II will develop and optimise this concept towards a detailed system definition. All investigations will take place within the context of a system view to enable a focused development of a system rather than individual components. In addition limited trials will be performed in order to assess some key elements of the WINNER II system.The radio interface will support the challenging requirements of systems beyond 3G. It will be scalable in terms of carrier bandwidth and carrier frequency range and it will allow deployment in newly identified and refarmed frequency bands. The system will support a wide range of usage and radio environments providing  a  significant  improvement  in  performance  and  Quality  of  Service.  The  resulting  system specification will meet future market demands and will provide optimum user experience.The radio interface will optimise the use of spectral resources, e.g. through the exploitation of actual channel  conditions  and  multiple  antenna  technology.  New  networking  topologies  e.g.  relaying  will support costeffective deployments. Support of advanced resource management and handover will ease the deployment of the WINNER system enabling seamless service provision and global roaming.The project will also contribute to the global research, regulatory and standardisation activities. The WINNER approach targets a globally harmonised system. The project objectives are shared by a strong Consortium of major players in the mobile and wireless communication industry including manufacturers, network operators, RD centres and the academic domain.3.6.1PHY TrialsQ Title and descriptionWINNER PHY Trials showcase and validate some concepts of the WINNER air interface, and is meant to be only a limited proofofconcept.Q HypothesisMain assumptions and preconditions Concerning implementation and validation, no direct performance targets exist, such as with selected key technologies A, B and C, achievable data rates of X bitsHzsecond A simple MAC user plane needs to be implemented too, as it is a vital part of the WINNER air interfaceDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6098Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 No higher  protocol  layers  are  included.  An  offtheshelf  TCPIP  stack  is  thought  to  run directly on top of the MAC user planeQ Simplifications, restrictions Work is based on existing proprietary hardware Not all investigated link technologies can be implemented, instead focus on some key features Target is not to show 1Gpbs air interface, but rather the underlying technologiesQ Demotrial roadmap  current stateMajor steps for the PHY trials are the following ones 0207 Trial baseline, with TCPIP stack 0607 More advanced algorithms 1007 Trials with radio frequency partsThe following events in 2007 have been attended or recognized Annual Review 5.3  16.3, Brussels WWRF18, 1215.6, Helsinki IST MobileWireless Communications Summit 1.7  5.7, Budapest  WRC07 22.10  31.10, Geneva WWI Innovation day, 13.11, Brussels Final WINNER ALL meeting 1112.12, Munich Annual Review 08Q Difficulties and risks There were some risk factors in the integration of the two WINNER trials. The integration took place directly before the IST and WRC07 conferences, and was successful.From realized  risks  one  can  mention  that  the  synchronization  and  integration  of  all  partner contributions was not successful  schedules did not match. Also because of schedules and events attended,  no  direct  measurement  results  have  been  yet  obtained.  There  are  however  some simulation results related to the work done.Q Position in the networkAlthough  the  trials  concentrate  on  the  performance  and  validation  of  WINNER  air  interface Layer 1 as a showcase, user applications such as audiovideo can be run over the radio interface from a WINNER base station to a WINNER user terminal. This is accomplished by connecting a TCPIP stack directly on top of the MAC user plane.Also it could be noted that the PHY trials does contain functions from the L2 layer of WINNER protocol stack, although in conventional systems many of these functions have been usually placed in the L1 layer.Q Goal, what to be provenThe objectives of WINNER II WP6 that can be directly associated with Task 12 Trials are as follows Preparation  of  trials  of  WINNER II  system concept  and air  interface  in  PHASE III  and validation of selected key technologies Preparation of a plan for the full WINNER system trials to be performed in Phase III Implementation and validation of selected functionality of WINNER system concept Provision of a limited proofofconcept based on existing hardwareDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6198Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The main goal of WINNER II PHY trials implementation and validation of selected functionality is to demonstrate some of the main features in WINNER at link level Novel link adaptation technique, together with WINNER LDPC forward error coding, and Working estimation techniques to enable the link adaptationOther targets, not related to WINNER features but rather to the showcasing of WINNER, are e.g. full bandwidth radio frequency parts usage of WINNER channel models with radio channel simulator live multimedia applicationsQ Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityThere are following physical interfaces 100Mbps Ethernet connection from the platform. This interface is used foro Data streamo Feedback RF interface to radio channel simulatorIntegration with the RRM trials was accomplished at network level, where the PHY trials merely offered a new data pipe from the AP to UT. Some measurement feedback was transferred through the interface, but usually in demonstrations the handover was performed manually.Q Demotrial scenariosThe scenario  mostly used in demonstrations was a  manual handover from a legacy system to WINNER, and vice versa. Data from a HDTV video camera was send through both systems, and there was always a visible difference in picture quality. On top of that, the technical details of the link adaptation were portrayed on computer screen, for further technical discussions.Q What has been developed by the project added value whats new HW, SW, proof of conceptT12 of  WINNER develops  realtime  HWSW implementations  of  key  WINNER air  interface algorithms and aspects. The work evolves into proofofconcept and validation by integrating the key aspects in a working manner, with reallife aspects such as limited precision etc.Q HW and SW descriptionThe PHY trial is based on a proprietary platform. The following pictures describe the standalone PHY trials.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6298Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q What are the evaluation criteria of the demosNo unambiguous evaluation criteria are targeted or requested.Q What added value coming from the IP is involved in the demotrialThe added value is a new MACPHY layer entity, which should enable highspeed data transfers in future.Q How do we take advantage of the new features developed in the different projects And relevance for a global WWI demoThe obvious way of incorporating WINNER PHY trials in a global demo is to use the integrated L2L1 parts as a part of a RAN, if feasible. Further study should focus on the interfaces of each projects trials and demonstrations.3.6.2RRM trialsThe RRM trial is the second trial defined in WINNER. The WINNER project is working towards defining and building a new radio network for providing the users high QoS and for meeting their demands and needs. An important part of the WINNER project is to make the new radio network able to cooperate with the legacy networks in order to provide ubiquitous access to the users, to prevent and resolve congestion situations and perform seamless intersystem handovers. For this cooperation between WINNER and legacy Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6398Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24networks there have been defined a cooperation architecture and many RRM algorithms inside WINNER. In order to test the functionality and the efficiency of the architecture and the RRM algorithms the RRM platform trial  has been defined.  The  basic  objective  of  the RRM Trial  is  the  proof of  concept  of  the cooperation architecture and algorithms and to show that the cooperation between WINNER and legacy networks is feasible.Except from the cooperation algorithms, the RRM trial will also show in the second year of the project the functionality of the intermode cooperation mechanisms of WINNER. Q Title and description The title of the RRM trials in the Internal Reports is WINNER emulator for cooperative RRM. The goal  of  this  trial  is  to  build  an  RRM platform,  which  will  validate  and demonstrate  the concepts of wireless networks cooperation in Systems Beyond 3G. This initiative brings an added value to the overall objectives of WINNER by providing an emulation and demonstration platform for the proofofconcept  of  the  interRANs cooperative  schemes and WINNER internal  intermodes functionalities. This platform is based on the platform defined by projects CAUTION and CAUTION, and will validate the WINNER System Concept on aspects of Radio Resource Management. The platform is based on realtime monitoring of the WINNER RAN and legacy RANs, and will support service requests and usersysteminitiated intermode and intersystem handover, as well as congestion management and QoS guarantee. The platform will be scalable and modular, so that any additional WINNER feature and new relevant specifications can be added at any given time.The basic architecture of this trial is shown in the next figure In  the  upper  part  of  this  figure,  the  components  of  the  WINNER  network  are  shown  the WINNER Access Point, will use 802.11abg wireless protocols, emulating a WINNER Base Station with three WINNER System Modes in the figure we show three antennas for the three modes of WINNER, but it will only be one AP, the BSAccess Control Server ACS will control the state of the WINNER network and the SRRMw unit will monitor the state of the network and forward  alarms  to  the  CoopRRM  entity  and  implement  and  execute  intraWINNER  RRM mechanisms. The CoopRRM entity will monitor the state of all the networks and implement and execute the Cooperative RRM mechanisms. In the lower part of the figure, the components of the legacy RAN are shown. At the legacy RAN we have the Monitoring Unit part of the SRRML, that monitors the state of the RAN. Finally, the User Terminal is capable of connecting to all the modes of the WINNER network and the legacy RAN, using a high level application that will exchange XML formatted messages with the CoopRRM. Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6498Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The previous figure shows the topology of the integrated WINNER trial as it was presented in the WRC event in Geneva and the WWI Innovation day in Brussels.The following interfaces are defined Ca interface This  is  the  interface  between  the  SRRMW and  the  ACS.  Over  this  interface,  RTTMs  are transferred from ACS to the SRRMW for monitoring purposes. In  addition, when the local RRM techniques are applied by the SRRMW, the commands are forwarded to the ACS over this  interface.  It  is  also  used  to  transfer  the  user  service  requests  for  intraWINNER management. CpW interfaceThis is the interface between the CoopRRM and the SRRMW.  This interface is used to send alarms to the CoopRRM, to provide the network status to the CoopRRM, on demand, and allows  the  messages  for  the  RRMs  techniques  including  handover  command  from  the CoopRRM. It  is  also used to forward new service requests that  cannot be handled inside WINNER to the CoopRRM entity. CpL interfaceThis is the interface between CoopRRM and SRRML. This interface is meant for the exchange of alarm messages from SRRML and also for the status demand messages from SRRML.Q HypothesisThe RRM trial assumes that there is an operating WINNER network in the same area of a WLAN Access Point. The RRM trial also assumes that there is an entity connected to the WINNER BS that will give statistics to the trial entities and will execute the commands that come from these entities and another entity in the WLAN AP that can send statistics to the trial CoopRRM entity. Also  the  RRM trial  assumes  that  the  mobile  terminal  will  be  capable  of  receiving  realtime applications and that it has 2 network interfaces  1 for WINNER and another one for WLAN. The integration with the PHY trial assumes that the PHY part playes the role of the WINNER network and the RRM part has a legacy Access Point to play the role of the legacy RAN. There is a HDTV camera streaming live video which is delivered to the RRM Trial User Terminal either Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6598Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24via the WINNER network PHY part or via the legacy network performing handovers between them.Q Simplifications, restrictionsSince the WINNER Base Stations do not exist in equipment, this trial has the simplification of emulating the WINNER Base Station with a Cisco WLAN Access Point capable of providing 802.11abg. The WINNER modes are emulated by the b  g interfaces of the AP and also by adapting the power and the throughput of the AP to the WINNER local area and widea area deployment modes values in relationship to the WLAN AP values.The integrated trial tests raised the restrictions of using a legacy AP, since the 802.11g system is capable of transmitting only up to 22Mbps with best conditions no collisions or interferences and is  not  capable  of  transmitting  the  HDTV  video.  Also  there  were  many  problems  in  the demonstration areas due to many WLAN APs in the same area that were creating interferences in our AP.Q Demotrial roadmap  current stateAn initial integration of the RRM trial was presented in the IST Mobile Summit 47 June 2006 in Myconos.  The RRM trial has been demonstrated in the following events in 2007 Annual Review 5.3  16.3, Brussels WWRF18, 1215.6, Helsinki IST MobileWireless Communications Summit 1.7  5.7, Budapest  WRC07 22.10  31.10, Geneva WWI Innovation day, 13.11, Brussels Final WINNER ALL meeting 1112.12, Munich Annual Review 08.Q Difficulties and risks In the standalone RRM trial there are no major risks. The only risk and difficulty could be the way to persuade the viewers of the demonstrations that the Hypothesis described above is real and that this trial does indeed show what it claims and is not a handover between WLAN access points.The integration of the RRM trial and the Physical trial has been requested by the WINNER PMT in order to align the two trials and present an integrated one that would show in better terms the work inside WINNER. This integration was not foreseen at the beginning of Phase II and this could affect the work in both trials. The risks of this integration rely on the interface definition between RRM and PHY and on the capability of each trial to get the inputs of the other trial commands, statistics  and evaluateexecute the related functions.  Another difficultyrisk  is the added value in terms of effort that is needed for this integration.Q Position in the networkThis trial is related to the WINNER RRM cooperation architecture, which is the architecture for the cooperation of WINNER and the legacy networks. This cooperation architecture is what is simulated  here  in  this  trial.  The  entities  of  the  platform  are  simulating  the  functions  of  the cooperation architecture entities and a part of some WINNER architecture entities needed for this cooperation to work. This trial is related to the core and access network.The RRM trial  is  working  on different  layers.  Building RRM algorithms and communication protocols between the PCs we can say that it is working on layers 2 and 3 of the OSI model. Also it  is  working on providing the  mobile  user  different  applications  ftp  downloading and video streaming and showing the seamless handover of these applications from WINNER to WLAN or the opposite we can also say that the RRM Trial is also working on layer 7.Q Goal, what is expected to be provenDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24The basic goal of this trial is to prove the concept of the Cooperation Architecture defined in WINNER  for  making  the  network  able  to  cooperate  with  the  existing  legacy  networks.  The secondary goals include the validation and evaluation of the cooperation mechanisms  admission control, congestion avoidance control, intersystem handover.The goal for the integrated trial is to show that WINNER can present a common demo to show the functionality of both the Air Interface technology and the RRM mechanisms that have developed in the project.Q Inputs, outputs, interface and interoperabilityThe inputs for this trial come from the WINNER Base Station, the WLAN Access Point and the User Terminal. These inputs are Real Time Traffic Measurements RTTMs from the BS and the AP  that  show  the  condition  of  the  WINNER  and  the  WLAN  network.  Example  of  these measurements are in the following tablename RTTM RTTM1 Latency per userRTTM2 LatencyRTTM3 Erroneous UL packets per userRTTM4 Total UL packets per userRTTM5 Erroneous DL packets per userRTTM6 Total DL packets per userRTTM7 Erroneous UL packetsRTTM8 Total UL packetsRTTM9 Erroneous DL packetsRTTM10 Total DL packetsRTTM11 Lost UL packets per userRTTM12 Lost DL packets per userRTTM13 Lost UL packetsRTTM14 Lost DL packetsRTTM15 Peak throughput per userRTTM16 Average throughput per userRTTM17 UL payload data KbytesRTTM18 DL payload data KbytesAlso there are inputs from the user, when he requests a handover to another network for any reason and also when he requests a new service. The outputs of the trial are intersystem and intermode handovers and users QoS insurance.There could be interfaces with the WINNER PHY trial for getting statistics from WINNER BS andor to other demonstratorstrials that could connect our trial with GPRS andor UMTS Base Stations  giving  us  statistics  so  we  could  have  a  full  trial  for  the  WINNER  cooperation architecture. Q Demotrial scenarios The concept  of  the platform is  to demonstrate  the cooperation between WINNER and legacy RANs. The platform will  be tested for several  scenarios. These scenarios will  proveshow the functionality of the different entities of the cooperation architecture and the functionality of the different cooperation mechanisms. The scenarios that will be demonstrated are the following1. HO1 intermode handover  IMHO2. HO2 intersystem handover  ISHO3. Network Congestion4. Admission1 new service request from an user5. Admission2 new userDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M246. integrated trial handover7. integrated trial RTTMsThe scenario to demonstrate the cooperation of different RANs is the vertical handover scenario, which in our case is considered as Intersystem Handover ISHO. This type of handover can be initiated for several cases i.e. congestion in the current network, loss of coverage, user preference for another network, change of requested service, user decision to change network for i.e. payment reasons etc. Another demonstration scenario will be the Intermode Handover, which is the handover between the different modes of the WINNER network i.e. short area  wide area mode. This handover can be initiated if the User Terminal is out of a mode coverage area, or whether it changes its velocity, or by congestion situations. Another demonstration scenario will include different  TLS Traffic Load Scenarios, where by changing different  parameters  we can emulate  congestion situations in the networks both in WINNER and the legacy RANs. In that case the congestion control algorithm will take place and force IntersystemIntermode Handovers. The demonstration will also include a scenario where the user will change the service he receives. In WINNER there are considered many services to be offered to the users. Some of these services can be offered only from WINNER and not from the legacy RANs. This scenario includes a user that is admitted in a network and receives a specific service, but for any case, he changes the service he wants to receive i.e. he surfs in the internet but he wants also to download a large video. Then the system will try to find the best suitable network to handover the user in order to receive the new service with best QoS and efficiency. Another scenario is related with a new user that is connected to the system, and the system tries to send the user to the network that is most suitable to him in terms of received QoS according to the condition of the networks and the requested service. Two scenarios are envisioned for the integrated trial demonstrations. The first one is to perform a realistic handover between the PHY trial and the RRM trial and the other one is to prove that the RRM trial can monitor also the WINNER PHY part by exchanging RTTMs between the PHY part and the RRM part.Q What has been developed by the project added value  Whats new HW SW Proof of conceptThe RRM trial is not working on Hardware and is related strictly to software. It is implemented a program to extract statistical information from Cisco Access Points that are used in the trial. Other than that, the software developed in the trial is only related to the functionality of the platform entities and could be in the future applied in the real implementation of the WINNER equipment.Q HW and SW descriptionThe hardware used in this trial includes several PCs, 2 WLAN APs and basic Ethernet switches. The software running on the PCs includes Microsoft Windows XP and Fedora Linux, Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005, MONO project for running C executables in Linux etc.Q What are the evaluation criteria of the demosOne  of  the  goals  of  the  trial  is  the  evaluation  of  the  functionality  of  the  RRM cooperation mechanisms by making trials of the algorithms and evaluating the results. When the platform will be  fully  functional  many  trials  will  be  done  and  the  functionality  of  the  implemented  RRM algorithms Admission Control, Congestion Control, Handover will be evaluated and validated.Q What added value, coming from the IP, is involved in the demotrialThe added value from this trial is the proof that the networks beyond 3G like WINNER will be able to operate together with the existing legacy networks. Also this trial will show that the future networks can be integrated with the legacy ones and cooperate with the goal of providing the users with maximum QoS. These will be shown in practice with physical implementations and not in theory with simulations.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6898Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Q How do we take  advantage of  the  new features  developed  in  the  different  projects  What  is  the relevance for a global WWI demoIn this trial it is developed the Cooperation Architecture between WINNER and legacy networks, so as mentioned above the trial could be connected to other trialsdemos that are working in legacy networks and all together could coexist in a global WWI demonstrator.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 6998Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M244.CrossanalysisWe did a brainstorming on transversal approaches to highlight relationships between demostrials of the different  WWI projects.  This  brainstorming  outlines  3  major  topics,  which  are  chosen  for  the  crossanalyses. This work takes as inputs the descriptions with common criteria worked out in previous chapter. These cross analyses aim at expressing the links, overlaps, redundancies, complementarities between the projects demostrials. Finally, this work will also help studying the feasibility of a global scenario in the future.4.1Cross Analysis of the relative positioning of the demos within the networkScope of the crossanalysisHighlight complementary parts as well as redundant parts of the network that are demonstrated.Analysis with reference to the different telecom layers and possibly according to CI SI layers approach. Have a common map with the visualisation of the layers tackled by the demos. Q For missing parts, suggest how they could be tackled in one of the suggested demos, what could be the enhancementsevolutions of the demo to integrate the missing parts. Q For redundant parts, highlight the consistency, what are the differences on the way they are demonstrated orand the assumptions.Conclude by highlighting what could be the ideal interconnection between those demos.The relationships between the different projects demos have been studied. The matrix of these relations is mentioned is the following board, and detailed in the following text.Relation of project X and project YAN WINNER SPICE MobiLife E2RAN XX See below See below See below See belowWINNER XX XX See below See below See belowSPICE XX XX XX See below See belowMobiLife XX XX XX XX See belowE2R XX XX XX XX XXDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7098Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Figure 410 Illustration of Network LayersThis figure gives an overall view of the relative positioning of the projects. Possible interactions between the demos is analysed hereafter.The interactions between the projects in terms of radio resource management wan investigated in the WWI Cross Issue System Interfaces. The latest work of the CI SI has created a global RRM entity for the WWI projects that is called HRRM Heterogeneous RRM. Realizing HRRM in a network scenario built on the assumption that radio access is provided by various heterogeneous access networks leads to the need to structure the overall network into an access independent stratum and an access dependent stratum. This conclusion  is  supported  by  all  WWI  projects,  where  HRRM  represents  the  fusion  of  radio  resource management functionalities in each involved project AN, E2R and WINNER termed as MRRM, JRRM and CoopRRM respectively.  The HRRM entity will be the main cooperating RRM entity in the WWI wireless world and it will be responsible of executing the RRM mechanisms that are common to all the projects i.e. executing intersystem handovers. The CI SI distinguishes four basic types of access networks for the selection process Legacy RANs such as the 3GPP UTRAN or IEEE WLAN and WiMax networks Reconfigurable legacy RANs, which allow the deployment of different radio access technologies on the same physical hardware and in a shared spectrum, Future RANs represented by the RAN specified by the WINNER project and Future reconfigurable RANs.The reconfiguration of  a  WINNER RAN is  not  yet  specified,  but  it  is  included in  the figure  as  an optional case or as an example of a possible reconfigurable future wireless network. The implementation of the HRRM functions and the interactions between the access independent functions HRRM and RCM is described in the following section by means of a representative set of procedures covering the following use cases. HRRM selecting and invocating the WINNER RAN case 1 WINNER RAN and reconfigurable RAN HO request to HRRM for Inter System HO case 2 spectrum coordination between WINNER RAN and reconfigurable RAN case 3Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7198Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 HRRMRCM radio reconfiguration of reconfigurable RANs case 4 HRRMRCM request for access to additional operator resources case 5 Reconfigurable Terminal adapting its resource selection strategy following a network configuration and policy change case 6Below more details for the interactions between the projects are given.AN  WINNER Ambient  Networks  aims  at  integrating  heterogeneous  access  technologies  via  the  Ambient Resource Interface ARI. The Radio Access Technology being developed within WWI, WINNER is of course the natural choice for developing a joint demonstration. As stated above the latest work of the CI System Interfaces has created a global Radio resource Management RRM entity for the WWI projects that is called HRRM Heterogeneous RRM and is  responsible  of  executing  the  RRM  mechanisms  that  are  common  to  all  the  projects  i.e. executing intersystem handovers. This entity will be based on the different RRM entities of the projects i.e. WINNERCoopRRM, ANMRRM, E2RJRRM. The SI work has created a basis for the interworking of the projects in network level and this can help the validation team to organize a global demonstrator. By implementing the use cases that are mentioned before in this section, the potential overlaps between the projects especially between AN and WINNER who both work on  the  cooperation  between  RANs  can  be  overcome and  a  common trial  will  eventually  be feasible and very interesting. This can be easier achieved by integrating the existing demonstrators of the projects than building a new one from the scratch and trying to alter them to follow the descriptions of each use case. Since AN is working on integrating different access technologies and since WINNER is working on cooperating the new network with the legacy networks, AN and WINNER are close to each other. AN needs information, statistics and data from the WINNER network for the integration and WINNER needs statistical information and access to the legacy networks that can be provided by AN. So a joint  demonstration between WINNER and AN could have as a  goal to present common RRM mechanisms in  both  projects,  like  intersystem HO handover,  AC admission control  and  CAC  congestion  avoidance  control,  by  integrating  the  standalone  project demonstrations, exchanging statistics between them and making common decisions. Differences between AN RRM and WINNER RRM In Ambient Networks there is an MRRM coordinating the general access evaluation and selection, while WINNER has CoopRRM to target coordination with legacy RANs. Thus, when a new radio access is selected which moves the active session tofrom a RAN under CoopRRM, the radio access will have to rely on the MRRM control function. Thus this use case from MRRM point of view is to activate a WINNER RAN association when such radio access  is  needed case 1.  The  CoopRRM use cases  view is  to request MRRM to handle a new access selection such that the WINNER RAN association will be removed at HO execution. E2R RAN can also use the similar HO request for Ambient MRRM intersystem HO case 2. In general, AN is working towards building ACS and making all the networks able to interwork, though WINNER does not care about the interworking of the other networks, but it is focusing on cooperating the WINNER network with the legacy networks. Some cooperative functions and entities that exist in the two projects have similar scope like MRRM and CoopRRM, but the execution  of  the  functions  is  different  in  the  projects.  For  example,  in  AN  the  intersystem handover is  being executed via  node ID architecture,  though in  WINNER RRM platform the mobile IP solution is being applied. Maybe in the general concept there could be some similarities in the two projects, but in reality the differences are more. Another big difference is that AN is focusing only on intersystem cooperation, though WINNER is now focusing more on the intraWINNER RRM, the intradeployment mode RRM and the interdeployment mode cooperation.AN  SPICE  MobiLifeDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7298Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 In order to challenge the different AN control functions, simple applications could be developed that operate over the Ambient Networks, e.g. video streaming clients etc. Due to the fact that the development of such applications is not  in the focus of Ambient  Networks, they will  be kept relatively  simple.  Thus,  it  would  of  course  be  very  beneficial  if  the  far  more  advanced  and complete  Applications  developed  in  SPICEMobiLife  could be  brought  together  with  the  AN control space. Further study on the feasibility is needed. The System Interface to be used is the ASI. Some first ideas of what services could be used over the interfaceo Service Adaptive Transport Overlays  The applications specify the address of the peer and the service characteristics, and the Ambient Networks functions take care of setting up  an  appropriate  transport  overlay,  possibly  including  functions  like  transcoding  or content personalization. Possible  overlap  with  the  SPICE work,  they  also  seem to  work  on  overlay networks. This needs to be further investigated. o Context Information Access to different types of context e.g. device properties, network properties, etc. information from the Ambient Network.o Triggering,  i.e.  dynamic  notification  of  different  events,  e.g.  notifications  of  mobility events. A realization of the ASIrelated functionality seems realistic within a midterm perspective. A first implementation of the ASI is on its way based on Web Services. Within CI System Interfaces, the ASI work appears to be the most advanced work item. SPICE  MobiLife SPICE  deals  with  service  platform  and  with  services  themselves,  MobiLife  deals  with applications.  The two projects have overlapping areas, although the approach and the focus are different. The key element of the MobiLife approach is the User Centricity,  therefore the focus has been on applications that are, first of all, relevant for the intended users and that provide advanced features in terms of the research areas addressed by MobiLife. In order to achieve its objectives, MobiLife has developed an architecture that has been evaluated and whose capabilities can be embedded within the work of SPICE. The final results on architecture coming from MobiLife can be found in deliverable D5.8.WINNER  SPICE, MobiLife WINNER is considering many triggers for intersystem handovers and some of them are related with services, applications and user preferences. This info could come from the projects SPICE and MobiLife.  NB  In WINNER, applications  are  used  for  the  demos  these  applications  are already existing ones. As memo, WINNER is focussing on Phy layer and on RRM. In demonstrations it is not clear how WINNER could relate to the other 2 projects. Maybe the applications and services developed by the other 2 projects could run over the WINNER RAN and adapt when there is a handover to a legacy network. As indicated in the part of Chapter 3 dedicated to MobiLife, the applications developed are not particularly demanding in terms of network capacity, interfaces etc. The requirements are mostly on the enablers that might be part of the SPPSDP, which in turn might or might not be in the hand of a classical TLC operator for the advanced services to be provided. During the evaluation phase it  has  been noted that  some of  the applications,  in some use cases,  might  require high bandwidth or high storage capabilities, but this today is not part of the results. It has to be noted that multimedia applications, and video in particular, have not been a focus within MobiLife.WINNER  E2R E2R  is  working  on  reconfiguring  networks  and  is  considering  also  future  networks  to  be reconfigurable. One of the future networks is the WINNER RAN. A joint demonstration could be related with E2R reconfiguration of the WINNER network. Of course it is not clear yet if and how Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7398Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24the WINNER RAN could be reconfigurable, but one option is to reconfigure the WINNER BS to change mode. As long as WINNER RAN can be perceived as a distinct RAT in a heterogeneous environment, it may be part of the candidate set of RATs, when E2R DNPM in the network part and E2R REMS in the terminal part are called to decide for the optimum RAT selection for a reconfigurable element to operate with.E2R  MobiLife MobiLife  is  working on innovating and deploying  new applications and services  based on the evolving capabilities of 3G systems and beyond. E2R demonstrates management functionality that mobilizes a cross layer optimization to select the optimum parameters RAT, frequency, QoS levels ...  for  the  elements  to  operate  with.  In  this  framework,  DNPMREMS demonstrators  require, among others, full knowledge of the diverse userterminal profiles and the dynamically changing context, which may be provided as input by MobiLife.E2R  Spice A relationship similar to the one in E2RMobiLife case can be also stated here. SPICE platform is  one  of  the  options  offered  to  userterminals  when  deciding  to  register  for  optimal  service provision.ConclusionFigure 411 Network Scenario Including LayeringDate 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7498Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24As illustrated in the above figure, different possible ways of cooperating exist. Firstly, SPICE and MobiLife can  cooperate  to  provide  a  certain  service,  e.g.  by  offering  SPICE  service  enablers  to  a  MobiLife application.  The  application  and  the  service  platform can  then  make  use  of  the  control  infrastructure provided  by  Ambient  Networks,  e.g.  read  context  information  from  the  network  or  request  the establishment  of  a  transport  overlay  across  different  networks.  Such  a  connection  could  then  e.g.  be realized by using the advanced air interface provided by the WINNER project. The E2R reconfiguration function could help to quickly adapt certain parts of the network to new or changed requirements.As a conclusion, it can be stated that the network layers the different WWI projects are working on have fairly small overlaps. However, certain overlaps exist, e.g. certain radio resource management functions provided by both Ambient Network and WINNER. In order to develop demonstrations that are consistent with the architectural concepts of the involved projects, these issues need to be sorted out first before the work on the implementation could start.4.2Crossanalysis of the consistency of the hypothesis and requirements of the demosScope of the cross analysisHighlight the consistency of the different hypothesis taken by the different demosCompare Time target of demos, type of demo HW, SW, conceptual, availability of the different steps date of the conceptual phase, prototype and requirements on features for the handsetnetworketc.The objective is to check whether the demos are aligned in terms of assumptions, roadmap, requirements for the network and UE, consumers target, and then if they are physically fitted to work together HW, SWConcerning hypotheses made by WWI projects Ambient Networks II  integrated prototypeAmbient Networks makes the hypothesis of interoperable interfaceso The ARI downward interface is expected to interface with e.g. various RANs. This is a task for CISI to specify the interfaces so that working interoperability can be achieved with minimal costs for example interoperability of ARI between AN and WINNER.o The ASI upward interface is expected to interface with applications and services or service platforms. If we need to interface an application that does not support ASI with ACS, then we will have to develop a specific interfacing module. This would imply a limited number of applications. On the other hand, if there are ASIcapable applications AN developed or service platforms SPICE, then the restriction might be nonexistent. E2R II  REMS demoo For this demo, hypotheses are mainly made on hardware. For the final demo, a special Motorola phone is needed, but first, a reconfigurable processing board with Nokia 770 Internet table running the configuration management software is needed. The essence of the demo is not in the hardware, nevertheless, but rather in the dynamic configuration of a device,  taking  into  account  the  available  RATs  and  their  respective  offers  with associated QoS.  E2R II  DNPM demo o The demo makes the hypothesis of reconfigurable network elements, but since on a larger scale this is not possible, the demo mostly consists of simulation on a PC network. MobiLifeo Some specific content for the applications was created. Also all users were registered to MobiLife. No particular hypothesis was made in the capability of any chosen RAT that was used, nor does the registration hypothesis seem to influence a global demo. SPICE o A hypothesis is made that a user has to be registered to the SPICE platform. It seems that SPICE is similar to MobiLife in the way that no specific RAT is targeted nor needed, and the focus of the project is on a service platform, which should enable new services and applications  in  future  networks.  The  registration hypothesis,  again,  is  just  a  detail  of SPICE, and does not seem to influence a global demo.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7598Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24 WINNER II  PHY Trialso Hypotheses mainly concern throughput and features of the L2L1 data path.o Apart from that, an important hypothesis is that there will be a TCPIP interface, with this, the trial platform can be considered as a data pipe, through which data and control can be transported. It should be noted that since the trial is limited proofofconcept, the RAN control plane is largely missing. This most likely cannot be substituted from any other project, but if the needed interfaces can be created or emulated, perhaps this is not a large problem WINNER II  RRM Trialso Hypothesis of a multinetwork capable UE one of the network is of course WINNER, the other currently WLAN, which is capable of sending realtime measurements of the linknetwork and capable of executing inbound commands from the RRM entities.o Hypothesis that the WINNERCoopRRM or WWIHRRM entity will  be able to get statistical information of the legacy networks.Concerning time schedules of the demostrials of WWI projectsAll  projects  with  the  possible  exceptions  of  SPICE  the  project  lasts  30  months  and  MobiLife terminated seem to have the following events as main targets EU Audit 07, IST Mobile Summit 07 and EU Audit 08. However, the realization of a global demonstrator is not considered for 2007.Concerning network and UE requirements Ambient Networks II  integrated prototypeo AN has  interfacing  requirements  for  the  RANs and service  platformsapplications.  It would seem to be that no requirements for actual RATUE type exist, but for simplicity WLAN is targeted first in the demonstrations. E2R II  REMS demoo The  main  requirement  is  perhaps  a  reconfigurable  UE,  again  perhaps  there  are  no requirements for actual RAT type used, but again for simplicity WLANBluetooth are targeted first in the demonstrations. MobiLifeo There are perhaps no requirements for the networkRAT used, as it is implied that the project is about applications.  SPICE  PHY trialso The same as  with MobiLife,  the project  deals  with  the applications  layer  of  the OSI model. WINNER II  PHY Trialso There are no requirements, as the trials target the Layer 1 parts of yet new and mostly unspecified  WINNER  RAT.  The  processing  platform  must  of  course  have  some performance to cope with larger bandwidth, higher data rates, and enabling algorithms. WINNER II  RRM Trialso The hypothesis  analysis  of  RRM trials  can be reviewed here  The  RRM trials  make hypothesis regarding the available networks both WINNER and WLAN networks, the existence of a statistic collector, and a twointerface capable terminal.ConclusionThe following table sums up some restrictive hypotheses taken by the demosProject name Restrictive hypothesisAN Applications should support ASI interface and this is not considered yet by Spice  MobiLife applications  service platformE2R Demos prove the SW dynamic configuration of the UE and is not mature yet for dynamic HW adaptation.Spice  MobiLife no specific restriction however ASI interface suggested by AN are not considered Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24yetWINNER The proof of concept focus only on the physical layer without any signalling and protocols simulation. The multiRRM demo, as E2R demos, considers that the UE is a multinetwork capable equipment non existent for the momentIt seems that no project targets simply conceptual demonstrations. Each project considers hypothesis, so as to simplify the demo and in order to really focus on the added value of the project. Within some projects, there are several demonstrationstrials at least partly targeting the same goals. During synthesis phase, it should be selected which demostrials could be integrated into a possible global demonstration. Things that should be considered are e.g. the readiness of a candidate demo, and the fact whether a demo complements the global demonstration.In terms of a global demonstration which should incorporate trialsdemonstrations from all projects, it is obvious that some protocol stacks will be missing, as WINNER is the only project researching a new RAT, and it  will  have only limited trials on parts of it.  Some of the projects assume a working RATRAN. Nevertheless, it should be feasible to assume that WINNER can offer a simple and parametrizable data transport and offer at least some degree of different conditions that could trigger further network functions in other projects trial and demonstration hardwaresoftware.When considering a paper global scenario, we need to integrate all the specificities of the projects and relate them together. When considering a real global demonstrator, some more issues have to be considered such as the practical choices of implementation e.g. which software  hardware is used. It should be emphasized that CrossIssue System Interfaces plays a major role in the efforts towards a global demonstrator, since if a global, integrated scenario can be synthesized, the interfaces between the different projects demostrials play a major role, and the feasibility of integration largely depends on it. As an  estimation,  the  most  difficult  interfaces  might  be  the  ARIANI,  and any  interfaces  E2R needs  for reconfiguring  RAN parameters,  since  according to  discussions,  all  others  e.g.  ASI are  perhaps  more standardlike and can be easily created, both logically and physically.4.3Crossanalysis of the scenarios of the demosScope of the cross analysisTry to compare the scenarios are there similarities Are there complementaritiesDo they fit the same level of realism, or on the contrary, does one of them seem to us more futurist and less realisticThis analysis will help defining a global scenario. This will lead us to a common story line. Initiate this work by highlighting links between the different scenarios, and propose eventually how one could precede another one, how one could include another oneThe scenarios developed by each of the projects highlight the specific aspects of each of the projects therefore it is difficult to compare the scenarios.At high level, most of the scenarios are quite similar and they describe possible use of advanced network capabilities    AN,  Winner,  E2R    or  specific  advanced  applications  or  services    MobiLife,  SPICE. However, the way such scenarios are then used is quite different and finally the demotrials, in some cases, will not have much resemblance with the original scenario.This is due to different reasons for the different projects, but in most cases the issue is always on the difference between the capabilities that the scenarios require and the actual availability of such capabilities today.MobiLife has focussed on advanced applications, requiring sophisticated enablers. Such enablers have been developed during the project together with the applications that make use of them. However, scenarios and applications  do  not  address  any  of  the  key  features  addressed  by  AN,  E2R  or  Winner.  Of  course, availability of such capabilities would extend the scope of the application scenarios of MobiLife, but would Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24not  radically  change  their  application  fields,  nor  would  have  significant  impact  on  the  user evaluationacceptance, which is a key parameter in the MobiLife process.The biggest similarities in demonstration scenarios could be found between SPICE and MobiLife. These projects research solutions for application layers, therefore they use a similar approach. While SPICE is oriented on service platform for networks beyond 3G, MobiLife is targeted on mobile applications for such an environment.Even if demonstration scenarios in all projects were driven by an approach that they should rather show project results, it is possible to find some similarities. This is due to the fact that all projects operate in similar network environments. In SPICE and MobiLife,  similar  scopes  that  could be  found are  contextawareness,  privacy and trust, content  adaptation,  semantic  interoperability,  presencelocalization  mechanisms,  seamless  access  to services and delivery, operating in heterogeneous service landscape.Analyzing  MobiLife  scenario  Personal  Context  Communicator  we  can  find  issues  like  context management, distributed communication sphere, services based on user preferences, etc. like in Common SPICE Scenario and Modality Learner and Recommender Subsystem or DCS demo. In the scenario Integrated Family Maps we have got personalized advertisements pushed directly into user terminal like in Common SPICE Scenario and Modality Learner and Recommender Subsystem.MobiLife project was near to an end when this analysis was made, so it was rather impossible to influence its results on this level so MobiLife results should be used in the stage as they are now that the project is finished.In Ambient Networks Joint Use Case JUC we could find issues like multimedia content adaptation and delivery and also seamless service delivery in changing network environment and between different types of terminals. The first thing that could come to mind is the fact that the Intelligent Portal demonstration scenario  from  SPICE  is  really  similar.  In  both  stories  we  have  got  travelling  familiespersons  and multimedia content that should be delivered to their terminals in heterogeneous environment. Going deeper into the topic, we could see that in AN J.U.C. are also used presence mechanisms, present also in SPICE and MobiLife.It is  obvious that projects like Ambient Networks, WINNER, E2R would like to show more technical aspects in their demonstration scenarios than in SPICE or MobiLife, but bringing a common demonstration scenario is highly possible. It should be probably a kind of story where we have got for example travelling family watching multimedia content e.g. TV, movies in seamless way on different types of terminals in different network environment. It is desirable that travel should take place across a few European countries service roaming and family should also receive some advertisementsinfos based on their  preferences contextbased service mechanism. In the scenario based on such a story all cooperating WWI projects could find a place for their specific demo aspects, like reconfiguring networks E2R, running multimedia stream through radio interface WINNER, etc.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 7898Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M245.Building a Global ScenarioOne  achievement  of  the  CIV  is  to  build  a  global  scenario  based  on  WWI  demos  and  concepts, illustrating  how WWI projects  can be  assembled  towards  providing  enhanced value  added endtoend services.5.1Motivations for a global scenarioThe Cross Issue Validation has developed a global scenario, including all WWI projects, in order to highlight the specificities and complementarities of these different projects towards an end to end Beyond 3G architecture.  As  shown in  previous  chapters,  each  WWI project  focuses  on  a  specific  part  of  the infrastructure  application,  radio  interface,  radio  resource  management,  etc.,  enabling  specific  added services. The aim via this global scenario is to show how these WWI projects can be combined together so as to deliver enhanced endtoend services. This global scenario is elaborated based on demos and concepts of WWI projects. It illustrates how the different innovations of the WWI project fit together and how they will jointly shape the wireless world of the  future.  In  parallel,  a  reference  is  made  towards  representative  WWI demonstrations  and  concepts enabling this feasibility.Two levels are used in this global scenario description Everyday language  to show that WWI enabled services are understandable and useful to anyone cf main streamline in center of Global Scenario figure, following Bobs life. Technical language to show how everyday use cases are technically supported.

In the morning, he gets ready to leave his home and watches a video. The video is streamed to his fixed TV set via his DSL line and his WLAN access at home. The media is automatically adapted in the network to fit  the device based on context information. In addition, the video stream is adapted by the network operator to include different additional information, e.g. the latest information about delays in the bus schedule in a pictureinpicture or a textbox fashion. When Bob leaves the house he transfers the media session to his PDA, which receives the media also via the DSL line and his home WLAN. The media delivery is, again based on context information in the network, adapted to the capabilities of the new device. Related demonstrationsconcepts  AN demos 1 and 2, featuring the concepts of contextawareness, adaptive media distribution. 5.3Commuting to workWhen the  businessman leaves  the house,  his  WLAN will  soon not  be  available anymore.  This  is detected by the AN Generic Link Layer,  which provides abstracted information about the link quality. Consequently, his device starts scanning for a new access. It detects a WINNER access, but Bob is not a subscriber of this access provider. However, using the AN concept of network composition, the device can negotiate the terms of usage for this access including the related compensation data, and connect to the new network. The handover is coordinated by the AN MultiAccess solution MRRM. Related demonstrationsconcepts MultiAccess MRRM and Network Composition, provided by AN. Demo 1 MRRM, all demos Network Composition. Highspeed radio access provided by WINNER.Bob takes the bus to get to the meeting point. During the bus travel, he decides to select another film from a Video on Demand service. He runs on his personal mobile phone in the SPICE Dynamic Desktop environment a widget  the SPICE Content Guide that shows a list of movies based on his profile and preferences. He uses the Content Guide recommendations based on rates that the movies received from other users and watches the film via UMTS.

In the meeting room, as he is early, he continues viewing the film and in parallel would like to download files for the meeting. In this particular area Conference Centre and during this time zone of the day e.g. 9001200 a particular increase in demand for high data rate services is observed. As a result, it is decided that one or more  transceivers  are  reconfigured  for  radio  access  technologies  with  high  data  rate  capabilities,  also having the option to borrow and utilize unused spectrum. Related demonstrationsconcepts This decision making is related to the concepts of DNPMASM and also Flexible Base Station management and control referenced in E2R demos 4 and 3. Bobs terminal is provided with a set of available high data rate RATs, candidate of being selected. The RAT which is finally selected is the one that is offered at jointlyoptimum price and QoS levels. If not available, Bob will be asked to download the respective software for using the selected RAT. Related  demonstrationsconcepts  This  is  captured  by  REMS  functionality  assisted  by  network reconfiguration  management,  software  downloads and protocol  stack  reconfiguration  provided by E2R demos 2, 4 and 5. WINNER is selected and handover from UMTS to WINNER is performed.Related demonstrationsconcepts WINNER RRM demonstration. The newly built WINNER RAN in the area features a packetoriented, usercentric, alwaysbest radiointerface concept  targeting 100 Mbps sectorthroughput for widearea coverage and 1 Gbps for localarea coverage. WINNER is a scalable, flexible, and efficient radio interface, which provides a unified interface to higher layers by a small number of compatible system modes and implements tailored solutions. The alwaysbest  solution  is  further  supported  by  the  flexible  protocol  architecture  of  the  WINNER  radio interface and incorporates mechanisms for both longterm and shortterm adaptation. Related demonstrationsconcepts Scalable, finegrained adaptive radio link WINNER concept, with corresponding WINNER PHY trials. Both relaying and advanced spatial processing are integrated parts of the system architecture.  The higher data rates in WINNER RAN allow Bob to download all the slides needed for the meeting via FTP, simultaneously with his previous video activities. For this download, he needs to get authenticated by the SPICE service platform for this, he uses his mobile phone because his PC does not support the required authentication mechanisms. Thanks to SPICE GBA authentication mechanisms the user can navigate seamlessly between services, without the need to reauthenticate even if the service is provided by a third party.Related demonstrationsconcepts Split terminal authentication provided by SPICE.During the entire travel, and throughout the different access networks Bob uses, his device is identified using a persistent identifier AN NodeID architecture. This identifier facilitates the authentication and addressing of the node. The latter is further supported by the NodeID routing scheme, which easily enables changing the routing for a whole group of devices routing group, e.g. all devices in the bus. Related  demonstrationsconcepts  AN NodeID  architecture.  Related  AN Demos  Contained  in  all demos, particularly Demo 3 which features the NID Routing. 5.5Leisure timeThe businessman has the Dynamic Desktop client installed on his terminal. This SPICE component provides the enduser  interface.  It  is  responsible  for  displaying  the list  of  services that  the users  have previously selected and are currently available. Users can browse, install and add new services available on the SPICE platform, be notified according to their preferences, and start or stop enduser services. The businessman receives on his  terminal  interface  info about a  concert  nearby for tonight,  with music  he appreciates. Related demonstrationsconcepts  SPICE hybrid  service composition and visualization on Dynamic Desktop. When entering the concert theater and thanks to localization capabilities of CPC, the terminal is also provided with policies that may for example dictate it to operate in mute mode or allow taking photos only during the intermission.

The organizers of the concert are providing services related to information for the musicians, music and  video  downloading,  live  video  broadcasting  of  the  concert  in  different  video  angles  using  many cameras, targeting to using these features for earning money from the advertisements they will show. Most of these features will be offered only to WINNER or WLAN users due to the high data rate demands of the services. During the concert, many spectators use the services, so the cells in the concert area become congested and the users are not receiving the agreed QoS. Bob is now connected to WLAN and notices that by poor video quality and very low data rates in his mobile device, so he performs a handover to WINNER, which is decongested by the WINNER RRM mechanisms.

TridentCom Conference is an International Conference focussing on Testbeds and Research Infrastructures for the Development of Networks  Communities. This interest for Testbeds and Research infrastructures caught our attention. The goal of TridentCom is to create a forum where telecommunication networks researchers, vendors, providers and users can exchange ideas on past experience, requirements, needs, and visions  for  future  establishment  of  such  infrastructures.  It  showcases  experimental  activities,  such  as testing,  verification,  integration,  measurement,  and  deployment,  which  are  pivotal  to  achieving  next generation communications.This  is  the  reason  why  we  chose  this  conference  to  submit  a  paper  on  the  Cross  Issue  Validation achievements regarding WWI demos and integrated use cases via the Global Scenario.The CIV paper is entitled A Day in the Wireless World. Handson Experiences of the Future Wireless World.AbstractThe five projects of the Wireless World Initiative WWI create the vision for systems beyond 3G, focusing on a wide array of topics from future wireless air interfaces, through ambient networking, adaptive radio systems, service provisioning frameworks and distributed  application  architecture.  We  introduce  the  validation  approaches  of  the different WWI projects and show how the projects realize their demonstrations and trials in order to iteratively test and refine their concepts. After focusing on each project individually, we introduce a common storyline which gives a handson experience how the technologies developed by the WWI projects can jointly enhance the experience of users in the Wireless World.

This deliverable presents and analyses the 2006 stage of WWI demos and concepts. This present document is the 2007 deliverable. It is an enhancement of 2006 with all novelties from WWI projects, integrated demos, and activities of integration between projects, and also of dissemination.6.5WWI internal meetingsCIV participated to two yearly internal WWI meetings Oct 2006 and Sept 2007 in France, with all cross issues and WWI Project teams. This was the occasion to summarise CI and projects activities, to brainstorm together, then decide on orientations.CIV also had regular phone conferences.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 8998Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M247.Future of WWI projects demosDuring FP6 timeframe, many demos were elaborated and developped in each WWI project. Hereafter is given an outlook on further development and usage of WWI projects demos and trials. These are the next steps that seemed us interesting to investigate.Q Future of AN prototyping Apart from the demonstration setups, the main outcome of the Ambient Networks Phase 2 project is the common codebase consisting of prototype implementations of the control functions. These implementations have been kept generic so that they could e.g. suit the needs of all five demonstrations. The project strives to make as much of this code as possible available to the public so that future work of AN partners and interested people from the research community can take these implementations as a basis for experimenting and evolving the technologies developed in the project.Q Future of E2R demos The future of the E2R demos in the short term is mainly concentrated on the finalisation of the integrated demonstrations described in sections 3.3.7 and 3.3.8 above, so as to end the project by fulfilling the initial goal, that was to provide a highly integrated platform for validating reconfigurable, SDRbased infrastructures and respective management and control functionality. In the longterm it is expected that part of the currently existing prototypes will act as a basis for validation activities  within the upcoming E3 project,  mainly concerning the extension of prototyping towards cognitive systems.Q Future of WINNER demosQ update the RRM trial for serving more than one user at the same time. Implement mobileIP based  handovers  for  the  intersystem  handover  case.  Implement  intrasystem  handovers basically  intermode  handovers  with  the  assistance  of  the  PHY  trial  demo,  which  will implement  the  different  WINNER modes.  Serving  the  users  more  applications  currently video streaming future  web browsing, FTP, etc..Q Parts  of  the  existing  PHY trials  codebase  and  hardware  will  most  likely  be  used  in  the CELTIC  project  WINNER,  where  the  general  aim  will  be  to  implement  simultaneous channel measurements and field tests, with an implementation of a radio link that will use key features in WINNER. This should enable direct measurements of the efficiency of the radio link,  and  also  comparing  the  behaviour  of  the  link  in  measured  and  emulated  channel conditions. Enhancing some algorithms to improve estimation about the link, real antennas field tests capabilities.Q Future of SPICE demos updating all demos using results from user validation Task 8.4. Next step will be an integration of particular demos in order to build one integrated SPICE platform prototype. Integration will cover two aspects technical integration and integration into one common storyline.

In a nutshell, main outcomes of CI Validation activities areQ Common platform for discussing and exchanging knowledge, plans, etc.This is really an exceptional accomplishment, normally this is not possible due to NDAs. Cross Issue Validation regular phone calls and together work enabled crossfertilization between the projects, driven by the wide range of experts, ranging from physical layer experts to service platform designers.Q As the definition of the prototyping plans progressed, the Cross Issue Validation has ensured that, with all required freedom for validation within the individual scopes of the projects, the results support the validation of the overall WWI vision.Q Common marketing and showcase, e.g. for IST Summit and WWI Innovation DayMainly the common global story, but also logistic support.Q The common scenario gives a great overview of the future of the wireless technology and how new concepts, both technologies and services, can be integrated together to create an end to end Beyond 3G system. The Cross Issue Validation missions were three fold Q Sharing of information,Q Analyzing and creating a global view of WWI demos,Q Dissemination of CIV results.This deliverable presents you the results of these activitiesThe description of the major demostrials of each WWI project was given in chapters 2 and 3. Within the Cross Issue Validation team, we defined a common set of criteria that we then use to fully describe the demostrials. These common criteria facilitate information sharing between the projects, and enable people unused to a given project to better understand the goal and means of a demo. Based on this better knowledge of WWI projects demos, we defined transversal approaches to highlight relationships between demostrials of the different WWI projects. These cross analyses aim at expressing the links, similarities and complementarities between the demostrials, and are presented in chapter 4.This leads to the elaboration of a global scenario, presented in chapter 5. This global story line includes all WWI projects and highlights their specificities and complementarities towards an integrated endtoend B3G architecture. In the global scenario, you can find in parallelQ a simple everyday life storyQ technical references to WWI concepts and demos.Anyone, whatever his age or interest in technology, will be interested by services presented in the everyday life story there are every day use cases. Whereas technophile people will also be interested to see what are the conceptsdemos underpinning these new services and their tight integration.This global scenario provides a good overview on WWI projects concepts and demos, and show how they can fit together for B3G system. Dissemination is a key mission for the transversal group that is cross issue validation. All dissemination activities led by CIV were presented and illustrated in chapter 6 Q conferences  participation  IST Summit,  WWI Innovation Day,  with demo opening,  poster presentation, demos presentationQ paper submitted to a European conferenceQ article written by journalists based on CIV leader interviewQ internal WWI presentationsWe concluded with a very positive assessment of transversal CIV activities and proposed directions for future works in projects demos.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 9198Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M249.ReferencesWIND2.10 IST2003507581  WINNER  D2.10  Final  report  on  identified  RI  key  technologies, system concept, and their assessment, December 2005AND15 Ambient  Networks  Phase  1  Deliverable  D15  Ambient  Networks  Framework Architecture, 20051231, available online on httpwww.ambientnetworks.org AND16 Ambient Networks Phase 1 Deliverable D16 Ambient Networks Case Studies, 20051231, available online on httpwww.ambientnetworks.org ANDH1 Ambient  Networks  Phase  2  Deliverable  D.H1  Final  Application  Scenarios  and Prototype Design, 20061130, available online on httpwww.ambientnetworks.org E2RD6.5 E2R I Deliverable D6.5 Demonstrations and events report, December 2005, available online on httpe2r.motlabs.comDeliverablesSPD1.1 SPICE    Deliverable  D1.1    User,  enterprise,  technical  and  open  market  business requirements, httpwww.istspice.orgSPD1.2 SPICE  Deliverable D1.2  Scenarios definitions, httpwww.istspice.orgSPD1.5 SPICE    Deliverable  D1.5    Revised  Requirements  and  Scenarios,  httpwww.istspice.orgSPD8.1 SPICE  Deliverable D8.1  Report Pioneering SPICE project, a view by focus groups from  the  fields  of  Intelligent  Portal,  eTourism  and  eemergency  Services, httpwww.istspice.orgSPD8.2 SPICE    Deliverable  D1.2    Report  An  indepth  view  on  SPICE  project,  using Intelligent Portal, eTourism and eemergency scenarios, httpwww.istspice.orgSPD8.4 SPICE    Deliverable  D8.4    Integrated  prototype  environment  with  implemented scenarios, httpwww.istspice.orgE2RD8.1 ERII Deliverable D8.1 ProofofConcept First Report on Internal Milestones, White Papers,  Contributions  to  Dissemination,  Regulation  and  Standardisation  Bodies,  and Validation Criteria and Scenarios available online on httpe2r2.motlabs.comE2RD8.2 ERII Deliverable D8.2 ProofofConcept Final Report on Internal Milestones, White Papers,  Contributions  to  Dissemination,  Regulation  and  Standardisation  Bodies,  and Results From Demonstrations and Trials available online on httpe2r2.motlabs.com by December 2007.E2RD5.3 ERII  Deliverable  D5.3  Report  on  the  Developed  HW and SW Modules  available online on httpe2r2.motlabs.comE2RD5.4 ERII Deliverable D5.4 Testbed Integration, Demonstrations and Feedback to the Others Workpackages available online on httpe2r2.motlabs.com by December 2007E2RD4.4 ERII Deliverable D4.4 Validation of Robust Dynamic End to End Reconfiguration, available online on httpe2r2.motlabs.com by December 2007.E2RD2.3 ERII  Deliverable  D2.3  Validation  of  System  Architecture,  Mapping  to  Physical Configurations,  and  Draft  Support  Mechanisms  available  online  on httpe2r2.motlabs.comE2RCPC P.

ICT Results reports back from WWIs crowning event. It is Monday morning in the nottoodistant future and two neighbours, Bob the builder and Bob the businessman, are getting ready for work. The builder has to drive to a job in a nearby town and the businessman needs to take the train to the office. They switch on their televisions and request information on road and rail conditions.Outside their front doors, the two Bobs wish each other a good morning and head their separate ways. On the train, the businessman watches the financial news on his palm pilot, while the builder tunes in his phone to his favourite digital radio channel and relaxes in the morning traffic to some classical music. Meanwhile, the businessman phones his secretary and tells him through his earpiece that he forgot his PowerPoint presentation and speech. Bob the businessmans palm pilot bleeps as he enters the stateoftheart conference centre where he is to give a speech and presentation. It informs him that he has entered a highdata rate zone and asks him whether he would like to switch to superbroadband. He sits in the conference buildings lounge area and notices a message from his secretary in his inbox. He begins to download the documents he requested and surfs the web to do some lastminute research.In the evening, both Bobs decide to go out. The builder checks the opera programme on his phone, while the businessman checks the cinema schedule and they buy their tickets online. Their phones esignatures authenticate who they are. As they enter the opera house and cinema, their phones automatically switch to mute.Wonders of a wireless worldThe EUbacked Wireless World Initiative WWI has developed the prototype usercentred systems that have brought these future Bobs a lot closer to the present. The integrated architecture the initiatives five projects  MobiLife, SPICE, WINNER, Ambient Networks, E2R see individual boxes  have developed will potentially enable millions of people to make the most of thirdgeneration and beyond mobile technology to work, relax and play any time, anywhere. And, to top it all off, their experience will not just be wireless but also seamless.Funded under the previous Sixth Framework Programme FP6, 20022006, the WWI has worked over the past few years to develop ambient networks which will enable the seamless transition and interaction between services across a range of currently distinct and disjointed technology domains.In the future, Bob and millions like him will be able to benefit from and enjoy lots of wireless services, describes France Telecoms Marion Duprez, who heads WWIs Crossissue Validation Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 9498Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24Team. The technology underpinning all this is very complex and sophisticated, but this does not matter to Bob.Threads in an intricate webAlthough they do not concern Bob, these platforms and how they relate to one another matter greatly to WWI. Each of the initiatives four projects focused on a particular technical challenge that needs to be overcome in order to enable mobile technology to come of age. At the same time, the projects worked closely together to ensure that their platforms and systems fit seamlessly together. This is what the WWI calls transparent seamless mobility through distributed architecture.Our team was in charge of creating the scenarios to show that the four projects could work together to provide integrated services, explains Duprez in the demonstration area of WWIs final conference, which took place in Brussels on 13 November 2007. Creating this endtoend system was a real challenge. It required a lot of brainstorming, coordination and experimentation.But, as the Brussels demonstrations amply illustrated, they pulled it off. It has been very valuable to have this cooperation between telecom operators, manufacturers and universities. Commission support was also invaluable in ensuring that the projects were welllead and coordinated, noted Duprez.Both industry and operators are already showing signs of interest. At France Telecom, we have invested a lot of effort into these systems as part of our commitment to offer new services to our customers, Duprez stressed.A new batch of WWI projects, which aim to continue the good work will, be funded under the current FP7 20072013.

It should give the individual work packages a better idea of which functionality is exactly needed and also forms the basis the planning of the individual demonstrations.The Joint Use Case describes a day in the life of a highly mobile business worker travelling to a meeting. On the way to this meeting, he attends video conferences, downloads data, interacts with coworkers and does a lot of other things.Scene 0 At homeIt is close to 8 am in London and Bob is at home getting ready to go to a business meeting in Liverpool. He owns a PAN that consists of a number of devices including a laptop WLANWINNERBluetooth and a Smartphone WLANUMTSBluetooth1 belonging to the same Security Domain. At the moment, the PAN is connected to the Internet via the home broadband access. An online conference is scheduled to start soon involving Bob and his European colleagues. Bob logs on to the conference server on his laptop using a Bluetooth headset which is also part of his Security Domain, and ANaware to move around in the house while talkinglistening. Before the conference begins, Bob starts to watch news from an IP TV service on his laptop. When the conference begins, he gets interrupted, and the IP TV session is transferred to the background. Just before Bob leaves the house, the PAN is triggered to start network discovery2 . The PAN proactively  attempts  to  discover  available  wireless  Wide  Area  Networks  e.g.,  UMTS,  WiMAX  by sending solicitation messages or requesting dedicated advertisements from the Access Broker. It receives advertisements from a number of WWAN operators, each advertising its services and rates. In addition the advertisements are provided with a digital signature of the operator to prove the authenticity of the operator and the service offering. All the available options for network access are evaluated by the PAN and a decision is made to use access from the EuroSmartTelcooperator. A request for connectivity is sent to the operator, including required QoS, terminal capabilities and some radio quality indications. Based on Bobs PAN request and on the AN special feature of retrieving current performance  load information about its networks covering the area, the operators network selects UMTS as access technology. The PAN establishes  connectivity  with  the  selected  operator,  while  Bob  triggers  by  closing  the  laptop  his Smartphone to take over the TV session and the news stream is seamlessly transferred to the Smartphone. Scene 1 In the carBob enters the car with his children, who will be dropped off to the kindergarten. While Bob is on his way to the railway station by car, he is synchronizing his large mailbox between his corporate mail server and his Smartphone, and the ongoing conference is closed. At the same time, Bobs children are watching entertainment for kids via streaming IP TV service on Bobs Smartphone. Bobs Smartphone is connected over Bluetooth to a MOSTCAN Gateway in the vehicles data bus systems Bobs PAN composes with the devices of the car. While driving on the road, Bob is able to control his Smartphone remotely over the onboard HeadUnit or steering wheel, by delegation of control rights from the  PAN  to  the  MOSTCAN  bus  systems.  For  this  reason  the  Smartphone transmits  its  device  and applicationcapabilities to the car gateway over Bluetooth, which in turn uses this information to create a customized HumanMachineInterface HMI. Now he can start the synchronization of his preferred audio files e.g. iTunes PodCasts to get his personal radio program, which is transferred over UMTS to the Smartphone, and relayed over Bluetooth to the car. When Bob arrives at the fuel station he is also able to connect over the Smartphone to the local WLAN HotSpot, and begins to download short movies for his 1  The smart phone may be realised with a PDA WLANBluetooth and a mobile phone UMTSBluetooth for demonstration purposes.2  Example triggers here may be signal strengthquality measurements, sensors detecting movements of Bob, profile and context information.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 9698Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24children. The video stream is handed over to WLAN, because of the higher data rate. The media content is transmitted to the audio and video system of the car over Bluetooth. Finally Bob drops off his children to the kindergarten, and continues his journey to the train station.Scene 2 Meeting at the train stationBob is going to meet his colleagues Jill and John in a coffee place at the station, before getting into the train. When Bob arrives at the railway station, the network detects 3 the new location of Bob and sends an advertisement over both WLAN and WINNER to Bobs Smartphone, which suggests Bob to turn on the laptop in order to continue with the news stream, which was moved to the Smartphone when Bob left home. Bob turns on the laptop from hibernationmode, and based on the received advertisements, the laptop immediately detects the advertised hotspots WINNERWLAN 802.11 at the station. The availability of the hotspot is reported to the network, and the operators access selection function recommends a handover to the hotspot due to the availability of the faster connectivity. The laptop performs a Network Attachment and handover with the selected hotspot, and the hotspots security domain policy accepts Bobs PAN. After the composition process between the laptop and the operator network Interworking type has been accomplished successfully, media enhancement is dynamically activated, adapted to Bobs preferences and network context, and Bob begins to watch news on his laptop. On this way he can continue to have a good experience and larger view of the IP TV service on his laptop. John, Jill and Bob are sitting in a coffee place at the station waiting for the train. The Security Domain of Johns PAN consists of a PDA WLAN. Jill has a Smartphone WLAN which is legacy in the sense that it does not support ANfunctionality or mobility management like HIP or MIP. John switches  on his  PAN, which discovers  the advertisements  sent  out  by Bobs laptop.  Bobs  PAN laptop is attached to the coffee places access point. Having coupled their devices several times before, the AN enabled devices  of  Bob and John automatically authorise  each other  mutually.  This  would be different with Jills Smartphone, as it misses this ANfunctionality. Bobs PAN laptop is acting as a relay and offers connectivity to the Internet through the coffee places WLAN access point. Johns and Bobs PANs communicate with each other by using the AN internetworking architecture HIPenabled. John and Bob are watching a news video stream from their own devices Johns PDA, Bobs laptop. While more and more people are joining the coffee station and using the WLAN hotspot,  the network detects the high load situation in the WLAN access and searches for users, which can be handed over to another access to improve the overall network situation. Because Bob has a flatrate tariff for all types of access and because his terminal can use the UMTS High Speed Packet Access HSPA, the network selects Bobs laptop and instructs him to make a Handover to the UMTS HSPA. Scene 3 Embarking the trainWhen  Jill,  John  and  Bob  leave  the  coffee  place  they  continue  watching  the  newsvideo  from  Bobs Smartphone. As the train arrives, they embark a coach of the train. The train has two mobile routers belonging to the same Security Domain. The coaches of the train are equipped with WLAN 802.11 Access Points AP, which offer connectivity to the Internet using UMTS HSDPAWLAN 802.11WiMAX access technology. When the train starts moving, the UMTSHSPA access from the train station gets weaker and a handover is performed to the coachs access point. 3  Example triggers here may be higher bandwidth, user policy, QoS measurements performed by a SATO Serviceaware Adaptive Transport Overlaysnode in the network.Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 9798Contract 027617Deliverable Report Cross Issue ValidationCovered period M1M24In the train John, Bob and Jill choose to watch the stream TV program from Bobs laptop again.  The journey  takes  some  time  and  after  a  while John  decides  to  watch  TV programmes  on  his  own  user equipment.Scene 4 In the trainJohn, Bob and Jill want to have a sandwich, which is served in another coach of the train. They move from one coach to another. Bobs laptop is triggered to make a handoff between the two accesses points in different coaches with context  transfer amongst  coaches  Ambient  Networks inherently supported.  The security  associations  between  Bobs  devices  and  the  two access  points  are  derived  from the  security association between the ANs resulting from the composition. The local mobility management, supported by the trains MR, hides the local movement from the peer nodes in the Internet.After finishing the sandwich, John wants to have some privacy to write emails. John decides to change the current coach and walks to another coach alone. He attaches to an access point in the coach. After this,  Bobs and Johns ANs are no longer composed.When John leaves Bob, Jill decides to leave as well to meet a friend in another coach, and her device Smartphone attaches to an AP in the coach.Scene 5 Access to sensor networksThe train  is  equipped  with  a  wireless  sensor  network  WSN,  which  can  provide  technical  data  e.g. temperature,  vibrations  of  the  train  as  well  as  service  information  e.g.  insideoutside  temperature, humidity to the passengers including John, Bob and Jill and crew members. They are accessed either locally or remotely via several modular WSN gateways WSNGW configured into one or more Security Domains. . The passengers can associate with the closest WSNGW to access the WSN services. After the authentication procedure, the crew members and maintenance engineers can get more service information and  technical  data  respectively.  Further,  the  WSN  and  the  WSN  GWs  can  be  configured  by  the administrator.Scene 6 Arrival to destinationLater on, a locomotive of another railway company is connected to the train, thus the network of the train will be extended Gatewayed Composition enabling all the users to exploit enriched service features. When coming closer to Liverpool, the train must slow down. The mobile routers in the train can change the access technology from UMTS HSDPA to WLAN 802.11WiMAX due to the slow speed of the train. The mobile routers make handoffs between WLAN 802.11WiMAX access points located along the track of the train on the way to the final station.Bobs laptop i.e. MR is connected to one of the trains MRs. This is also called a nested moving network case involving Security Domains on three levels the train, Bob and Bobs friends. In other words, Bobs and  his  friends  traffic  flow  through  two  MRs  to  the  Internet.  Bobs  laptop  does  not  provide  direct connection to the external APs, but is connected to the trains MR. Bobs MR and the trains MR act as Signalling Proxies for their clients. They implement the delegation of signalling rights Functional Entity.During the handovers i.e. at the station when embarking the coach, and at the destination station when disembarking the coach a change in QoS for the IP TV service may occur due to differences in available bandwidth  of  the  network  connections.  Therefore,  media  enhancement,  adapted  to  Johns  and  Bobs preferences and network context, is dynamically activated, so that both users can continue to watch the IP TV service on their user equipment.As the train arrives to the destination, the locomotive is connected to the stations network hotspot. Since the  stations  network  is  operated  by  a  third  party  ISP,  this  connection  also  results  in  a  Gatewayed Composition. Finally, John, Bob and Jill disembark from the train and head to the office to attend their meeting. Date 311207Revision V2 Security PUBLICPage 9898
