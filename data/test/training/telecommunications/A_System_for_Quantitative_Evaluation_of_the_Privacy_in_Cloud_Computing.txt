Abstract: Cloud Computing is a new model in the IT's world.
The privacy protection is one of the key challenges that the
cloud computing faces. The customers, in the cloud computing,
depend on the cloud provider to manage their data. In
addition, the cloud computing resources are sharing with
multi customers and these resources are located in different
regions that subject to different jurisdictions. All of these
matters lead to many privacy risks. In this paper, we try to
develop an initial quantitative evaluating system that aims to
help the customers to know what the privacy's weaknesses on
the cloud providers by evaluating whether the cloud provider
meets the privacy related issues or not.; this will help them to
make the decision.

Keywords: cloud computing, quantitative evaluation,
privacy, cloud provider.
I. INTRODUCTION:
Cloud computing is the most resonance word in the
current age of technology. People usually know cloud
computing as applications and services offered over the
internet. The United States National Institute of Standards
and Technology (NIST) has developed a good working
definition, which defines cloud computing with details as
the following:"Cloud computing is a model for enabling
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers,
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly
provisioned and released with minimal management effort
or service provider interaction." (Mell  & Grance 2009).
Under this definition, the cloud computing model has
five essential characteristics; they are on-demand self
service, ubiquitous network access, location-independent
resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured service
(International Telecommunication Union [ITU] 2012; Krutz
& Vines 2010; Mell  & Grance 2009). In addition, it has
three delivery service models; they are Software as a
Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) (ITU 2012; Krutz & Vines
2010; Mell  & Grance 2009). Moreover, the cloud
computing has four deployment models; they are public
cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud and community cloud
(ITU 2012; Krutz & Vines 2010; Mell  & Grance 2009).
Although there are researches that addressed privacy
issue on cloud computing, but until now there is not any
quantitative evaluation to evaluate the privacy in cloud
computing. Evaluation or assessment is a process of
gathering data and then analyzing or ordering it (Martinez
2005) to understand the current state of system with the
intent of enhancing or improving it (Pressman 2010). It can
be used to determine whether the organization is effectively
carrying out its practices, and the extent to which it is
achieving its stated objectives and anticipated results
(Martinez 2005). Both the qualitative factors and
quantitative metrics are considered during the evaluation
activity (Pressman 2010).
In this paper, we propose creating an initial evaluating
system to evaluate the privacy in the cloud provider by
using our proposed privacy framework in (AL-Aswadi &
Batarfi 2014) which we designed it to help the customer to
evaluate the level of privacy in cloud providers and to help
the cloud providers to increase the customer's trust on them.
This paper considers a supplement to our work that is
described in (AL-Aswadi & Batarfi 2014); it shows the way
of how to can use this proposed privacy framework to
evaluate the privacy of cloud providers.
In this paper, we will use the different processes to
develop the quantitative evaluating system. First, we will
define the key conditions and rules for evaluating. Next, we
will develop a scoring system to be used as a quantitative
weighting of the principle. Then, we will make an empirical
evaluation for some well-known cloud providers, to present
how to use this evaluation for assessing and comparing the
privacy in potential cloud providers.
This paper consists of seven sections. The rest of this
paper is organized as follows: Section 2 shows the related
works. Section 3 explains the key conditions and rules for
evaluating system. Section 4 presents our proposed scoring
system for developing the quantitative evaluation. Section 5
explains the comparison results for three well-known cloud
providers.  Section 6 discusses the final results and finally
in Section 7 we conclude our work.

II. RELATED WORK:
There are few studies about the evaluating the privacy
in cloud provider. For example, Abuhussein et al. (2012)
tried to identify and categorize the attributes, which
highlight the security and privacy provided by cloud
computing services. Then they presented how one can use
these attributes for assessing and comparing potential cloud
computing services from both a provider and a customer
standpoint. Table 1 shows their attributes of security and
privacy categories. After that, they set a set of important
factors for each attribute to assess the security and privacy
of cloud computing services. This study may be a one-step
of good steps forward to evaluate cloud computing services.
However, this study focuses on evaluating the security issue
more than the privacy issue. Furthermore, the evaluation in
Fatima N. AL-Aswadi et al, / (IJCSIT) International Journal of Computer Science and Information Technologies, Vol. 5 (4) , 2014,
www.ijcsit.com
this study was a manual evaluation that did not give
numerical values for evaluation to facilitate customers'
decision-making.


The study of Pauley (2010) gave an another example
for evaluation cloud provider. In this study the cloud
providers transparency was evaluated along four key
dimensions—security, privacy, audit-ability, and service
levels. Pauley created a scorecard system for evaluating the
cloud providers’ transparency via the cloud provider’s self
service portals and published Web content. This study
included a series of questions based on key areas outlined
by the CSA, NIST, and the European Network and
Information Security Agency (ENISA) as Pauley said. Each
question equated to a “0 = no, 1 = yes” value; the overall
score based on the total of all scores. Then the domain
based scores were divided by the total possible score to
provide a simple percentile equivalent. Also the overall
score was divided by the total possible score to derive a
percentile equivalent. Then Pauley made an empirical
evaluation for six cloud providers (Amazon, Google,
Microsoft, IBM, Terremark, and Savvis) to test the
scorecard and assess the transparency on them. However,
he anonymized the results of the six cloud providers, that he
chose them, by referring to them as CP1, CP2..CP6.

III. CONDITIONS AND RULES:
We extracted 18 privacy principles in our previous work
(AL-Aswadi & Batarfi 2014); here we set the key
conditions and rules for these privacy principles. Conditions
and rules indicate to conditions, status, and explanations
that are required to realize the privacy principles. Table 2
shows the key conditions and rules for the privacy
principles; it includes the limitation rules of collecting,
using, retaining, transferring, accessing and processing the
data. In addition, it includes the rights for the customer, the
conditions and rules of integrity, isolation and security of
data. Note that we only ask about the security (access
control) that related to privacy protection not for the
security environment in cloud computing. The assessment
of the security in the cloud computing is out of this study.
Moreover, this table shows the accountability, openness,
transparency conditions and rules that ask about the level of
transparency of cloud provider and if it commits to all its
responsibilities; also ask about the SLAs that the cloud
provider guarantees and if the SLAs apply for all services.
For example, if cloud provider has SLAs for service A and
not has SLAs for service B, then if we combine between
service A and B the SLAs will it be equal zero.
Furthermore, this table includes the physical location,
compliance and rest condition and rules as they are
explained in it.

IV. SCORING SYSTEM:
The weighting of every principle is the summation of
three sub-weighting fields. The first one is “Obligation”, the
weight is assigned to it if the cloud provider clearly obligate
the principle. The second one is “Link-ability”, the weight
is assigned to it if the information of principle is easy
access. The last one is “Conditions and Rules”, it indicates
the same conditions and rules that are explained in table 2.
The weighting of it is the sum of the weights for all
Conditions and Rules of principle.
Figure 1 shows the weighting process for every
principle. Ow is the Obligation’s weight, Lw is the Link
ability’s weight, Rw is the weight of Conditions and Rules,
n is the number of condition and rules for selected principle,
and W is the weight of selected principle which is the sum
of the weights for Obligation, Link-ability, Conditions and
Rules. Table 3 shows all privacy principles and their
weighting and shows the total score of weighting privacy
principles.
The final score of privacy level in cloud provider is
calculated by the following equations:


Where  represents the final score of privacy,  is
the sum of the weights for Obligation, Link-ability, and
Conditions and Rules for principle number ,
represents the Obligation’s weight for principle number ,
represents  the Link-ability’s weight for principle
number ,  represents the weight of Conditions and
Rules for principle number ,  is the condition or rule
number  for principle number . The value of  represents
the numbers of principles while the value of  represents the
number of condition or rule of  principle,  represents the
total number of conditions and rules for principle number .

V. COMPARISON RESULTS:
In this section, we examine the privacy of three well
known cloud providers (Google App Engine, Amazon Web
Service (AWS), and Windows Azure). We choose these
three cloud providers for two reasons:
1. Their years’ length in business is more than 10 years
(Pauley 2010).
2. They are the most popular among customers who are
interesting in cloud computing (well-known).

We built a manual comparison among the three selected
cloud providers to get the comparison results. Table 4
shows the weighting result for Google App Engine
provider; table 5 shows the weighting result for AWS
provider and table 6 shows the weighting result for
Windows Azure provider. This result has been gotten by
studying the privacy policies and related links of Google
App Engine, AWS and Windows Azure (Amazon 2006,
2011, 2013a-b, 2014a-b, n.d.a-c; Google 2013, 2014a-b,
n.d.a-b; Microsoft 2014a-e, n.d.; Palekar 2014; Ross 2011).

VI. FINAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:
As it is observed from the comparison results; the
Google App Engine provider got the highest score, which is
54, followed by Microsoft Azure provider which got 49
score and then AWS which got 45 score. To calculate the
percentage of privacy, we will use the following percentage
formula (TutorVista 2014):




By using the equation number (4) to calculate the
percentage, the Google App Engine got 64% of privacy
level, followed by Microsoft Azure which got 58%, and
then AWS which got 53%. Figure 2 shows the weight
percentage of every privacy principle for Google App
Engine, AWS and Windows Azure which are also
calculated by using the equation number (4). This figure
helps us to know which privacy principles have low score.
In other words, where are the weaknesses for protecting the
privacy in selected cloud providers?

Percentage = ScoreTotal Score × 100 (4)

Figure 2: The Weight Percentage of Privacy Principles for Google App Engine, AWS and Windows Azure

In Google App Engine, the data minimization and the
trans-border flow principles got 0%; the use and retention
limitation principle got less than 50%; while the data
integrity principle got 50% and the rest principles got more
than 50%. In Windows Azure, the sensitive data and the
trans-border flow principles got 0%; the use and retention
limitation, the consent and choice, the data integrity and the
compliance principles got less than 50%; and the rest
principles got more than 50%. In AWS, the data
minimization and the sensitive data principles got 0%; the
use and retention limitation, the consent and choice and the
data integrity principles got less than 50%; while the rest
principles got more than 50%.

The satisfactory result depends on the customers’
opinions themselves and what their needs are. For example,
some of them say it should not be less than 50%, while
others may say it should not be less than 70%, etc.

All of these results prove that the cloud providers need
to pay more attention and to make more efforts to protect
the customers' privacy. In addition, the cloud providers
need to be more transparent especially with regards to
collect, use, retain, transfer and process the customers’ data
.
Note that as we see from these results the isolation
mechanisms and security safeguards and encryption may
have 100% percentage. This does not mean they are high
level, but these are because we do not assess the security in
cloud computing, we only ask if there are some
mechanisms for access control, encryption and for isolation.
This point may be the limitation of this study that we will
address it in the future work.
VII. CONCLUSION:
The privacy protection is one of the most serious
challenges that the cloud computing faces. Protecting the
privacy in cloud computing is not an easy task especially
with the dependence on the cloud provider in the
management of customer data, the resources existence in
different regions that subject to different jurisdictions and
sharing the resources with multi customers of cloud
computing.
The responsibility of protecting the privacy in cloud
computing falls on the cloud provider and the government;
also a part of the responsibility falls on customers
themselves through increasing their awareness and
experience for evaluating the privacy of the potential cloud
providers to choose the suitable one.
In this paper, we try to develop an initial quantitative
evaluation system which aims to help the customer to
evaluate the privacy in cloud providers for helping them to
choose the suitable one of the potential cloud providers. We
have done an empirical evaluation for three well-known
cloud providers (Google App Engine, AWS, and Microsoft
Azure) to apply this evaluating system on them. The results
show that the cloud providers need to pay more attention
and to make more efforts to protect the customers' privacy.
