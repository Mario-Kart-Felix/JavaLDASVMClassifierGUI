Future of telecommunication  Internet telephony operator SkypeAntti TapioHelsinki University of TechnologyAntti.Tapiohut.fiAbstractIt is predicted that in the near future the different devicesof communication people currently use will converge fromphones, email, instant messaging, etc. to single devices andapplications. For example, voice communications and datatransfer can be combined in an easy way which will enablenew business opportunities. In fact, one company, namelySkype, is already exploiting these opportunities.In a short period of time, Skype has achieved a solid position in the Internet telephony market. This paper triesto identify the key factors that have led to the exponentialgrowth of Skype compared to its competitors. This paperalso discusses the changes that the new companies and technologies introduce to the telecom operator business models.The key factors of Skypes success are both technologicaland businesswise. The use of peertopeer networks has leadto an efficient and lean organization with minimal networkinfrastructure. The ease of use and the lucrative pricing ofthe application has helped Skype to reach a large user basein a short time.KEYWORDS peertopeer, Skype, Voice over IP, VoIP, Internet telephony1 IntroductionIn the past few years, many companies Skype11, Buzzfon1, Damaka2, Geckophone3, Teleo4, and Teltel5 have introduced Internet telephony applications that utilize peertopeer networks. Skype11, the largest and most well knownof these operators, has grown in only 1.5 years from nothingto a rapidly expanding Internet telephony i.e. Voice over IPVoIP operator with over 2 million active users as of March2005. Why has this happened The aim of this paper isto identify the key factors for success needed from Internettelephony operators and how Skype has managed to achievethem. The aim is also to recognize the changes the Internettelephony operators induce in the telecom business field.According to Schulzrinne et al. 10, 3, 2 the differentmeans of communication will converge in the near future.Voice calls, voice messages, email and instant messagingwill move closer to each other and ultimately they all can beused from the same application.1httpwww.buzzfon.com2httpwww.damaka.com3httpgeckophone.com4httpwww.teleo.com5httpwww.teltel.comAs the way people communicate changes, it is worthwhileto consider what will happen to the telecom operators. Howdo they need to change their business model to react to thenew competition from Internet telephony operators Companies offering Internet telephony services have existed forquite a while. Why have they not managed to achieve thesame as Skype has What makes Skype so special in comparison with other Internet telephony operatorsThe answer is twofold. Firstly, in the history of the Internet, protocols that work in complex network environments,have survived and become widely used. The open VoIP standards including session initiation protocol SIP have problems with this. For example, getting SIP to work over network address translation NAT requires considerable knowledge and effort. Skypes own protocols seem to make theirway over NAT and through firewalls.Secondly, the volumes of traffic are huge but the profitsare low. Major hardware investments are needed to supportmillions of concurrent users. Skypes solution is to harnessits users computers to do the work. The users are connectedin a peertopeer fashion. Some computers function as super nodes which communicate with each other. They areresponsible for connecting the users together and locatingthem from the network. The only things Skype has to do isto develop the software, market it and maintain a couple oflogin servers.The service, e.g. VoIP, should be ubiquitous, reliable, secure and easy to use but at the same time affordable. Onthe other hand the service providers are companies and theirprimary aim is to make profit. Here Internet telephony operators have at least at the moment several significant advantages over PSTN operators. Firstly, the ordinary telecomnetworks are location limited. This means that users have tochoose an operator that offers services in their geographicalarea. This may suffice for much of the time, but when theusers travel outside their home area, they have to hope thattheir local operator has roaming agreements with local operators in other areas. A Finn journeying through the UK,for instance, may find that Elisa has a roaming agreementwith Orange. By contrast, Internet telephony operators arenot limited in the same way, which gives them a competitiveadvantage.Telecom operators have large overheads from the existingnetwork infrastructure. New innovations are difficult to takeinto use as the old protocols and hardware is everywhere. AsInternet telephony is only a service in the network, it givesthe Internet telephony providers more freedom in the wayhow they implement the services they offer. Without the burden of old technology there are many new opportunities toHUT T110.551 Seminar on Internetworking 2005042627exploit the new technology to fulfill the needs of the users.The telecom operators are also regulated by various lawsand statutes. The Internet telephony operators can avoid theregulatory burdens by not connecting to the legacy network.But this is not a lasting situation, because presumably theusers want to communicate with all of their friends, not justwith those who happen to have an Internet telephony account. An interesting question is is it possible to combinethe freedoms of a Internet telephony operator and still fulfillthe regulations2 What do the users wantIn this section we identify the key factors that users demandfrom their communication service providers. For example,email, voice communication, instant messaging and chattingare all different forms of communication. Typically eachcommunication method needs its own application. Moreover, if a user wants to use different methods, he or she hasto install many different applications and learn to use all ofthem. This is a major inconvenience as the end user doesnot care about the communication technology he uses forcommunication. Fortunately there is a change coming onthe horizon. According to Schulzrinne 1 the different communication technologies will converge in the future. In otherwords, a user can utilize various technologies in one sessionwith a single application. So in the end, a user might noteven know which technology he or she is using. Furthermore, people will not have to use various devices to communicate with each other. Rather a user will probably have oneor two devices that fulfill all the needs.The most important thing in communication networks forpeople is that they can get in contact with their friends andrelatives. The larger the user base is, the higher are thechances that a user can locate his or her friends who are using the same application and communicate with them. Thisincreases the probability that the user will continue the useof a application. Closely related to this are the connectionsout from the operators network to other networks. This interoperability helps to give the end users more possibilities offinding their friends from the network. On the other hand interoperability in particular makes premium services possiblefor the Internet telephony operators. For example, the operator can connect their network to the PSTN and give theirusers the opportunity to make calls to ordinary telephonenumbers for a small cost.A large user base does not help if people are not wellreachable. The more communication channels available toa user, the more the user is able to communicate anywhereand anytime. This kind of ubiquitous communication serviceenables the user to free him or herself from worrying aboutreachability. For example, when a user is at home, he or shecan connect to the network with an digital subscriber lineDSL and when the user is strolling around shopping, theconnectivity is enabled by a alternative radio technologies,like Universal Mobile Telecommunications System UMTSor Wireless Local Area Network WLAN.Currently, slow Internet connections are available almostanywhere in the world. Mobile cellular networks offer connectivity with General Packet Radio Service GPRS andsimilar technologies. Faster networks are available in somecities, higher end hotels and airports. These networks arebuilt using WLAN technology. As the mobile networks areclosed and controlled tightly by their operators, there is amarket for WLAN hotspots.It can be predicted that future mobile devices will includemany different communication technologies. Already somePersonal Digital Assistants electronic handheld information devices, PDAs include GSM, GPRS and WLAN support. These devices free their users from having to carry alaptop with them. A successful Internet telephony operatorwill exploit these different technologies to the maximum. Bythis it can provide a service for end users that is as device andnetwork independent as possible.The mobile phone manufacturers have close ties with mobile telephone operators, because the operators are big customers for the manufacturers. As Internet telephony operators can be seen as direct competitors to the PSTN operators,the mobile phone manufacturers have a conflict of interests.This raises interesting questions. Will the phone manufacturers provide their own Internet telephony applications orwill some third party have to do that. For example, Skype hasplans for providing a client for Symbian series 60 phones.This would enable their users to be connected all the timeand make possible almost free calls between mobile phones.As a consequence, mobile telephone operators would probably have to rethink their strategies.For business users the needs are a bit different. but the basics are the same. They crave for cost efficiency, ease of useand extensive user base. But the business users want alsoto integrate Skype with their business systems. For example, a high volume helpdesk would almost certainly want tocut their phone bills. The helpdesk service providers havecomplex support applications that provide the helpdesk employees with call handling features and the management withvarious statistics and other relevant measurements. So whatthey basically need is a base messaging system that can beintegrated to third party applications.3 What Skype offersThe Internet Engineering Consortium defines 5 Internettelephony as communications services  voice, facsimile,andor voicemessaging applications  that are transportedvia the Internet, rather than the public switched telephonenetwork PSTN. The basic steps involved in originating anInternet telephone call are conversion of the analog voice signal to digital format and compressiontranslation of the signal into Internet protocol IP packets for transmission overthe Internet the process is reversed at the receiving end.According to Schulzrinne 10 Internet telephony can beseen in two ways, the first being that it is a transition fromcircuitswitched to packetswitched transmission of data inPSTN networks. The second way is that Internet telephony is just a new network service in the Internet. By thisSchulzrinne means, that as voice traffic can not be identifiedfrom other data traffic. This implies various consequences asno internet service provider ISP can limit the use of theirnetwork for voice communications.HUT T110.551 Seminar on Internetworking 2005042627As there are practically no network resources reserved forconnected Internet calls, there are no per minute costs either.This means that the traditional call model is going to break.There is no need anymore to limit the length of separate calls.On the contrary, there will probably be a ongrowing need tostay connected for long times. For example, parents couldkeep track of their children by keeping a connection open atall times and discussing with them periodically.Hassan and Nayandoro discuss these possibilities in theirpaper4. They assert that data, voice and fax communications will be integrated as they all can be built combiningdifferent voice and data protocols to a single application.3.1 Overview of SkypeSkype is the first major peertopeer Internet telephony operator. They have succeeded in providing the users easy touse, interesting, usable and affordable communication service. Their software has been downloaded almost 90 milliontimes and there are over one million people using SkypeOut,their main chargeable service. Why have the users started touse Skype This section tries to give an answer to the question. Information contained in this section is mainly basedon Schulzrinnes1 and Khamsis7 work.As mentioned in the last section, gathering a critical usermass is important in getting people to use your service.Skype currently has about two million active users any givenmoment11. This is not very much at the moment if wethink at a worldwide scope. But still, it is the largest P2P Internet telephony operator and the number of Skype users isgrowing rapidly. An interesting question is accordingly, howhas Skype managed to achieve this status in the market andwill it be able to maintain it.Skypes main advantages are ease of use, good voice quality and security. The installation and configuration of Skypeis easy. No special knowledge is needed. Basically the userjust has to create an account for the application and then heor she is ready to use Skype. The application works in almostany kind of a network configuration. Skypes client is available for many platforms. Currently March 2005, versionsfor Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and PocketPC are provided.Plans for Symbian series 60 support exist.Naturally users are concerned about their privacy. In ordinary telephone networks privacy is achieved by restricting access to the physical network. For example, only aselected group of employees have access to the PSTN exchanges. On the other hand all peertopeer applications arebased on the fact that data is routed through some third parties. This data might be very sensitive as it is the case withSkype. To overcome this, all messages have to be protectedfrom outsiders. According to Skype11 and Khamsi 7 alldata sent between two Skype users is encrypted. So the userdoes not have to worry about privacy if he or she trusts Skypeas whole.3.2 Skypes technologySkype does not disclose information about the technological side of their service. They havent released any publicdocuments about protocols used or about any other technicalFigure 1 The Skype Network1subjects. Fortunately a description of the protocol is available from Baset and Schulzrinne 1.From a technological point of view the Skype network isan overlay network that consists of three types of hosts ordinary hosts, super nodes and login servers. The relationshipof these nodes is illustrated in figure 1.First a client logs in to the network by registering itselfdirectly with the login server. It then connects to the networkthrough super nodes, which are other clients with sufficientcomputing power, memory and network bandwidth. Thesesuper nodes are responsible for locating users, routing callsand providing the clients information about hosts currentlyconnected to the network.Each Skype client maintains a host cache which is a list ofIP addresses of known super nodes. No personal data otherthan login information is stored in the network. For example,buddy lists are stored locally. This means, that a user eitherhas to create his or her buddy list again every time the userinstalls a new Skype client to a new machine or he or she hasto import it manually from another Skype installation.Basically this means, that Skype owns only the loginservers. All of the other computers are in a way lent fromtheir customers. This is in line with Skypes main strategywhich is to try to utilize the users hardware as much as possible 7.The most interesting algorithm that Skype uses is still unknown. Skype claims, that any user who has logged in tothe network in the last 72 hours can be found. This is abig promise as Skypes user count has exploded. They say12 they have implemented Global Index technology thatkeeps track of which users have used the network in the nearpast.All communication is encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard AES. The same algorithm is used by various United States Government organizations. The AES encryption keys are transmitted between hosts using the Rivest,Shamir,  Adleman RSA algorithm.Voice quality of Skype is claimed1 to be much betterthan the PSTN quality. The codecs used are probably liHUT T110.551 Seminar on Internetworking 2005042627censed from Global IP Sound6.Network configuration is automatic. This means, that theuser only has to enter only his or her login credentials to theSkype application and wait for the login to complete. Afterthat the user is ready to communicate using Skype. Internally, Skype uses Simple Traversal of User Datagram Protocol STUN9 and Traversal Using Relay NAT TURN8algorithms to bypass firewalls and Network Address Translations NAT.One of the latest events has been the launching of an openapplication programming interface API that enables thirdparties to develop their own addons for Skype. This hasproven to be very successful. Many third party applicationsare available ranging from answering machines to adaptersthat allow a user to connect ordinary telephones to their computer for use with Skype.A major drawback in the Skypes service was that theydid not provide phone numbers for users. In consequenceof this the Skype users were not reachable from normaltelephones. This is changing in the near future as Skype islaunching their SkypeIn product. With SkypeIn a user gets aunique phone number that can be used like any other phonenumber.3.3 Skypes businessSkypes future success is determined by at least two key issues. First, how does Skype generate revenue and second,will Skype be able to scale to adapt to the continuously expanding customer base. Where does Skype get its revenue asnormal communication between users is free of charge Theanswer lies in Skypes premium services. The main business logic of Skype seems to be to offer simple services forfree and charge money from everything else. Their biggestpremium service according to the web pages is SkypeOut.It enables the users to make calls from the Skype application to normal PSTN telephones. The charges are lowerthan by calling with an ordinary phone because Skype canroute the call very close to the destination through the Internet. Their second service is SkypeIn which has just beenlaunched worldwide. With SkypeIn people can call Skypeusers from PSTN networks. With SkypeIn the user can getup to three PSTN phone numbers which can be located indifferent countries. This means, that the user can be reachable by local calls from multiple locations. SkypeIn as aproduct could be the most profitable service as as Skype getsincome from both the user and the caller. A third example ofSkypes premium services is Skype Voicemail, basically ananswering machine.Another possible development in the future will be integrating SIP connectivity within Skype. This would enableSkype to interoperate with other Internet telephony operators. However, enabling interoperability has its risks. IfSkype users have connectivity to and from other Internettelephony networks there will be fewer and fewer reasonswhy the users should use specifically Skype as their operator. Thus, it is more difficult for Skype to lock their usersinto Skypes products.6httpwww.globalipsound.comAll these products described are services that require special agreements etc. between different parties. Ordinaryusers cannot create these by themselves. So these premiumservices are crucial for generating revenue to Skype. Naturally these services require more infrastructure than their freecounterparts. Premium services involve the need to gatheraccounting data for billing and access control for limiting theservices to the paying customers only. By collecting moneyfrom the services, the customers will also demand more fromthe service providers. Thus, in Skypes case they will needmore hardware to cope with the requirements of the premiumservices. This raises the concerns about the scalability ofSkype. Will the revenues generated by the premium servicescover the expenses for the additional hardware and softwareneeded4 Internet telephony and changes incommunication culturesIf Internet telephony achieves a status as one of the basic services in the Internet the way people communicate will probably change. Boyle3 and Schulzrinne1 both draw predictions about these transitions. As the so called call modelof telephone conversations is no longer relevant, people willfind new ways to communicate with each other. Schulzrinnegives two examples, pushtotalk and hootandholler. Thefirst, pushtotalk, is an adaptation of normal two way radio system to cell phones. The latter, hootandholler, is amulticastlike system, where information from one point istransmitted to numerous recipients. Other similar changes incommunication culture and possibilities could include monitoring equipment and similar machinetohuman or machinetomachine connections. As there is no time based charging,a remote burglary device, for example, could keep the usersinformed about its status constantly.Skype, with its open API and creative users, have createdmany examples of these new kinds of ways to make the mostof the services offered. The Skype Journal blog7 lists manyof these clever ideas. As an example, there are net radiostations operating over Skype, someone is using Skype as anintercom system in his house and so on.Internet telephony wont make PSTN networks obsolete.As Schulzrinne 10 predicts that the same will happen toordinary telephone calls as what has happened to fax whenemail got widely accepted. In other words, ordinary callswill be used for some special occasions when there is a particular need for it, just like fax is used for example to transfercredit card details.Still the PSTN operators will need to rethink their strategies. At the moment most revenues to them come from ordinary calls. If and possibly when Internet telephony bypassesPSTN networks in voice calls, the ordinary telecom operators will lose their main source of income. Fortunately, atleast at the moment mobile operators are not in a great danger. According to the reverse engineering report 1 Skypeuses about 2 kBsecond of bandwidth. That is 120 kB perminute. So if a user is using Skype over a GPRS mobilelink, he has to pay for data transfer fees of about 120 kB7httpwww.skypejournal.comHUT T110.551 Seminar on Internetworking 2005042627per minute. That equals to from 3 to even 60 euro centsper minute with the current Finnish mobile operator costs.So using Skype might not be always the cheapest solution.Of course long distance calls will probably still be cheaperwith Skype than through a mobile operator. Then again, fewpeople have constant needs to communicate with people notgeographically very near to them.As various Internet telephony operators achieve interoperability with PSTN networks, they also get closer and closerto being real telecom operators in the eyes of governments.A consequence of this is that the operators will need to fulfill local and global telecomrelated laws. For example, theymight be required to provide connectivity to emergency services, i.e. to the 911 or 112 numbers. All these requirementsinflict extra bureaucracy and extra investment needs. Theseproblems are becoming relevant for Skype too as they areproviding PSTN connectivity with their SkypeIn and SkypeOut products. Currently they are trying to circumvent theregulations by stating in their end user license agreement thatthey are not a telecom operator. However, this might not beenough. At least the Finnish government has plans6 to startregulating VoIP operators.5 ConclusionsOverall it can be said that the way people communicate ischanging rapidly. The breaking of the call model will enablenew methods and ways to communicate. The convergence ofapplications and devices will hide the different technologiesfrom the end user so that he or she will not know nor carewhich particular service he or she is using.The breaking of the call model will also make the life ofPSTN operators more difficult as all services and thus billingis currently associated tightly with the model. This will forcethe PSTN operators to rethink their strategies and businesslogic.Skypes success is based on understanding the needs ofpeople, and being able to fulfill them. It has also been thefirst company to utilize the opportunities in Internet telephony made possible by peertopeer technology. By offering free services, Skype has gathered a large user base thatis still expanding exponentially. Their revenue comes frompremium services that, for example, enable connectivity toPSTN networks.However in the future the competition will tighten, asSkype will have to start interoperating with other Internettelephony operators. Skypes competitors have a possibilityto achieve competitive advantage by offering same servicesas Skype, but with open standards. The openness is especially important in the business user segment.Regulation is on its way to Internet telephony. For example, in Finland the Ministry of Transport and Communication is investigating possibilities to extend the regulations toInternet telephony. Skype and other Internet telephony operators need to take these regulations to account in the nearfuture.Even if Internet telephony will achieve the status of mostwidely used telecommunication method, the original PSTNnetworks, as Schultzrinne points out10, will still continueto exist. They will be used in the same way as facsimiles areused today as a more reliable and secure way of communication than email.References1 S. A. Baset and H. Schulzrinne.
