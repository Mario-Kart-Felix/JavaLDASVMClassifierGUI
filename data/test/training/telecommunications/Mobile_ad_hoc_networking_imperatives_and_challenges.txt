Ad hoc networking concept is not a new one, having been around in various forms for over 20years. Traditionally, tactical networks have been the only communication networking application that followed the adhoc paradigm. Recently, the introduction of new technologies such as the Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and Hyperlan arehelping enable eventual commercial MANET deployments outside the military domain. These recent evolutions havebeen generating a renewed and growing interest in the research and development of MANET. This paper attempts toprovide a comprehensive overview of this dynamic field. It first explains the important role that mobile ad hoc networksplay in the evolution of future wireless technologies. Then, it reviews the latest research activities in these areas, including a summary of MANETs characteristics, capabilities, applications, and design constraints. The paper concludesby presenting a set of challenges and problems requiring further research in the future. 2003 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionThe proliferation of mobile computing andcommunication devices e.g., cell phones, laptops,handheld digital devices, personal digital assistants, or wearable computers is driving a revolutionary change in our information society.

The natureof ubiquitous devices makes wireless networks theeasiest solution for their interconnection and, as aconsequence, the wireless arena has been experiencing exponential growth in the past decade.Mobile users can use their cellular phone to checkemail, browse internet travelers with portablecomputers can surf the internet from airports, railway stations, Starbucks and other public locations tourists can use Global Positioning Systemed.14 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364GPS terminals installed inside rental cars to locate driving maps and tourist attractions, researchers can exchange files and other informationby connecting portable computers via wirelessLANs while attending conferences at home, userscan synchronize data and transfer files betweenportable devices and desktops.Not only are mobile devices getting smaller,cheaper, more convenient, and more powerful,they also run more applications and network services, commonly fueling the explosive growth ofmobile computing equipment market. The exploding number of Internet and laptop usersdriving this growth further 280. Projections showthat in the next two years the number of mobileconnections and the number of shipments of mobile and Internet terminals will grow yet by another 2050 280. With this trend, we can expectthe total number of mobile Internet users soon toexceed that of the fixedline Internet users.Among all the applications and services run bymobile devices, network connections and corresponding data services are without doubt the mostdemanded service by the mobile users. Accordingto a study by Cahners InStat Group, the numberof subscribers to wireless data services will growrapidly from 170 million worldwide in 2000 tomore than 1.3 billion in 2004, and the number ofwireless messages sent per month will rise dramatically from 3 billion in December 1999 to 244billion by December 2004. Currently, most of theconnections among these wireless devices areachieved via fixed infrastructurebased serviceprovider, or private networks. For example, connections between two cell phones are setup by BSCand MSC in cellular networks laptops are connected to Internet via wireless access points. Whileinfrastructurebased networks provide a great wayfor mobile devices to get network services, it takestime and potentially high cost to set up thenecessary infrastructure. There are, furthermore,situations where user required networking connections are not available in a given geographicarea, and providing the needed connectivity andnetwork services in these situations becomes a realchallenge.More recently, new alternative ways to deliverthe services have been emerging. These are focusedaround having the mobile devices connect to eachother in the transmission range through automaticconfiguration, setting up an ad hoc mobile network that is both flexible and powerful. In thisway, not only can mobile nodes communicate witheach other, but can also receive Internet servicesthrough Internet gateway node, effectively extending Internet services to the noninfrastructurearea. As the wireless network continues to evolve,these ad hoc capabilities are expected to becomemore important, the technology solutions used tosupport more critical and significant future research and development efforts can be expected inindustry and academy, alike.This paper demonstrates the impetus behindmobile ad hoc networks, and presents a representative collection of technology solutions used atthe different layers of the network, in particularpresenting algorithms and protocols unique to theoperation and dynamic configuration of mobile adhoc networks. Mobile ad hoc network MANETliterature is already too extensive to be coveredand analyzed in detail in this article. Hereafter, wetherefore present the main research areas in theMANET literature, and inside each, survey themain research directions and open issues.Inside the ad hoc networking field, wirelesssensor networks take a special role. A sensor network is composed of a large number of smallsensor nodes, which are typically densely andrandomly deployed inside the area in which aphenomenon is being monitored. Wireless ad hocnetworking techniques also constitute the basis forsensor networks. However, the special constraintsimposed by the unique characteristics of sensingdevices, and by the application requirements,make many of the solutions designed for multihop wireless networks generally not suitable forsensor networks 12. This places extensive literature dedicated to sensor networks beyond thescope of this paper however, the interested readercan find an excellent and comprehensive coverageof sensor networks in a recent survey 12.The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2,we explain why ad hoc networking is an essentialcomponent of the 4G network architectures. InSection 3, we look at mobile ad hoc networks incloser detail, covering their specific characteristics,I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 15advantages, as well as design challenges. This isfollowed by an analysis of MANET evolutionfrom an historical perspective. Finally, we conclude this section by presenting the design challenges facing the MANET research community.In Section 4, we examine ad hoc networkingenabling technologies, by examining Bluetooth,and IEEE 802.11 standards in more detail. Ad hocnetworking research is surveyed in Section 5, inwhich we focus on node location services, forwarding and routing, and TCP issues. MANETapplications and middleware are discussed inSection 6. Crosslayer research areas, including,energy management, security and cooperation,Quality of Service, and performance evaluationare analyzed in Section 7. Section 8 concludes thepaper.2. 4G and ad hoc networkingA major goal toward the 4G Wireless evolutionis the providing of pervasive computing environments that can seamlessly and ubiquitously support users in accomplishing their tasks, in accessinginformation or communicating with other users atanytime, anywhere, and from any device 268. Inthis environment, computers get pushed furtherinto background computing power and networkconnectivity are embedded in virtually every deviceto bring computation to users, no matter wherethey are, or under what circumstances they work.These devices personalize themselves in our presence to find the information or software we need.The new trend is to help users in the tasks of everyday life by exploiting technologies and infrastructures hidden in the environment, withoutrequiring any major change in the users behavior.This new philosophy is the basis of the AmbientIntelligence concept 1. The objective of ambientintelligence is the integration of digital devices andnetworks into the everyday environment, renderingaccessible, through easy and natural interactions, a multitude of services and applications.Ambient intelligence places the user at the center ofthe information society. This view heavily relies on4G wireless and mobile communications. 4G is allabout an integrated, global network, based on anopen systems approach. Integrating different typesof wireless networks with wireline backbone network seamlessly, and convergence of voice, multimedia and data traffic over a single IPbased corenetwork are the main foci of 4G. With the availability of ultrahigh bandwidth of up to 100 Mbps,multimedia services can be supported efficientlyubiquitous computing is enabled with enhancedsystem mobility and portability support, and locationbased services are all expected. Fig. 1 illustrates the networks and components within 4Gnetwork architecture.Network Integration. 4G networks are touted ashybrid broadband networks that integrate differentnetwork topologies and platforms. In Fig. 1 theoverlapping of different network boundaries represents the integration of different types of networks in 4G. There are two levels of integration.First is the integration of heterogeneous wirelessnetworks with varying transmission characteristicssuch as Wireless LAN, WAN, PAN, as well asmobile ad hoc networks. At the second level we findthe integration of wireless networks with the fixednetwork backbone infrastructure, the Internet, andPSTN. Much work remains to enable a seamlessintegration, for example that can extend IP tosupport mobile network devices.All IP Networks. 4G starts with the assumptionthat future networks will be entirely packetswitched, using protocols evolved from those in use intodays Internet 163. An all IPbased 4G wirelessnetwork has intrinsic advantages over its predecessors. IP is compatible with, and independent of,the actual radio access technology, this means thatthe core 4G network can be designed and evolvesindependently from access networks. Using IPbased core network also means the immediatetapping of the rich protocol suites and servicesalready available, for example, voice and dataconvergence, can be supported by using readilyavailable VoIP set of protocols such as MEGACOP, MGCP, SIP, H.323, SCTP, etc. Finally theconverged allIP wireless core networks will bepacket based and support packetized voice andmultimedia on top of data. This evolution is expected to greatly simplify the network and to reduce costs for maintaining separate networks, fordifferent traffic types.Fig. 1. 4G networks.16 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364Lower Cost and Higher Efficiency. 4G IPbasedsystems will be cheaper and more efficient than3G. Firstly, equipment costs are expected to befour to ten times lower than equivalent circuitswitched equipment for 2G and 3G wirelessinfrastructures. An open converged IP wirelessenvironment further reduces costs for networkbuildout and maintenance. There will be no needto purchase extra spectrum as 2G3G spectrumcan be reused in 4G, and much of spectrum neededby WLAN and WPAN is public and does not require a license.UltraHigh Speed and Multimedia Applications.4G systems aim to provide ultrahigh transmissionspeed of up to 100 Mbps, 50 times faster thanthose in 3G networks. This leap in providedbandwidth will enable highbandwidth wirelessservices, allowing users to watch TV, listen to themusic, browse Internet, access business programs,perform realtime video streaming and othermultimediaoriented applications, like ECommerce, as if sitting in home or office.Location Intelligence. To support ubiquitouscomputing requirements, 4G terminals need to bemore intelligent in terms of users locations andservice needs, including recognizing and beingadaptive to users changing geographical positions,as well as offering locationbased services 29.Anytime anywhere requires intelligent use of location information, and the embedding of theinformation into various applications. PossibleLocation Based Services include finding nearestservice providers, such as restaurant or cinemasearching for special offers within an areas warning of traffic or weather situations sending anadvertisement to a specific area searching forother users active badge systems, etc. Outdoor,wireless applications can use GPS to obtain location information. GPS is a satellitebased systemthat can provide easy, accurate positioning information almost anywhere on earth. Many GPSimplementations are available, including integrating a GPS receiver into a mobile phone GPSDGPS or add fixed GPS receivers at regularI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 17intervals to obtain data to complement readingson phone AGPS or by using help from fixedbase stations EOTD. These implementationsprovide different fix time and accuracy rangingfrom 50 to 125 m. For indoor applications, sinceGPS signal cannot be received well inside thebuildings, alternative technologies like Infrared,Ultrasound or Radio are being considered.Noninfrastructurebased MANET are expected to become an important part of the 4Garchitecture. An ad hoc mobile network is atransient network formed dynamically by a collection of arbitrarily located wireless mobilenodes without the use of existing network infrastructure, or centralized administration. Ad hocnetworks are created, for example, when a groupof people come together, and use wireless communications for some computerbased collaborative activities this is also referred to as spontaneousnetworking 93.In a MANET, the users mobile devices are thenetwork, and they must cooperatively provide thefunctionality usually provided by the network infrastructure e.g., routers, switches, servers. In aMANET, no infrastructure is required to enableinformation exchange among users mobile devices. We can envisage these devices as an evolution of current mobile phones, and emergingPDAs equipped with wireless interfaces. The onlyexternal resource needed for their successful operation is the bandwidth, often the unlicensedISM band. Nearby terminals can communicatedirectly by exploiting, for example, wireless LANtechnologies. Devices that are not directly connected, communicate by forwarding their trafficvia a sequence of intermediate devices.MANETs are gaining momentum because theyhelp realizing network services for mobile users inareas with no preexisting communications infrastructure, or when the use of such infrastructurerequires wireless extension 67,102. Ad hoc nodescan also be connected to a fixed backbone networkthrough a dedicated gateway device enabling IPnetworking services in the areas where Internetservices are not available due to a lack of preinstalled infrastructure. All these advantages makead hoc networking an attractive option in futurewireless networks.3. Mobile ad hoc networksAs concluded in Section 2, ad hoc networkingcapabilities can become essential in deliveringoverall next generation wireless network functionalities. Next, we will look at mobile ad hocnetwork applications from an historical perspective, and then we will focus on challenges in theMANET research activities.3.1. MANET evolutionHistorically, mobile ad hoc networks have primarily been used for tactical network related applications to improve battlefield communicationssurvivability. The dynamic nature of military operations means that military cannot rely on accessto a fixed preplaced communication infrastructurein battlefield. Pure wireless communication alsohas limitation in that radio signals are subject tointerference and radio frequency higher than 100MHz rarely propagate beyond line of sight LOS97. Mobile ad hoc network creates a suitableframework to address these issues by providing amultihop wireless network without preplacedinfrastructure and connectivity beyond LOS.Early ad hoc networking applications can betraced back to the DARPA Packet Radio NetworkPRNet project in 1972 97, which was primarilyinspired by the efficiency of the packet switchingtechnology, such as bandwidth sharing and storeandforward routing, and its possible applicationin mobile wireless environment. PRNet features adistributed architecture consisting of network ofbroadcast radios with minimal central control acombination of Aloha and CSMA channel accessprotocols are used to support the dynamic sharingof the broadcast radio channel. In addition, byusing multihop storeandforward routing techniques, the radio coverage limitation is removed,which effectively enables multiuser communication within a very large geographic area.Survivable Radio Networks SURAN weredeveloped by DARPA in 1983 to address mainissues in PRNet, in the areas of network scalability, security, processing capability and energymanagement. The main objectives were to developnetwork algorithms to support a network that can1 httpwww.meshnetworks.com2 httpwww.spanworks.com18 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364scale to tens of thousands of nodes and withstandsecurity attacks, as well as use small, lowcost,lowpower radios that could support sophisticatedpacket radio protocols 97. This effort results inthe design of Lowcost Packet Radio LPR technology in 1987 94, which features a digitallycontrolled DS spreadspectrum radio with an integrated Intel 8086 microprocessorbased packetswitch. In addition, a family of advanced networkmanagement protocols was developed, and hierarchical network topology based on dynamicclustering is used to support network scalability.Other improvements in radio adaptability, security, and increased capacity are achieved throughmanagement of spreading keys 253.Towards late 1980s and early 1990s, the growthof the Internet infrastructure and the microcomputer revolution made the initial packet radionetwork ideas more applicable and feasible 97.To leverage the global information infrastructureinto the mobile wireless environment, DoD initiated DARPA Global Mobile GloMo Information Systems program in 1994 171, which aimedto support Ethernettype multimedia connectivityany time, anywhere among wireless devices. Several networking designs were explored for example Wireless Internet Gateways WINGs at UCSCdeploys a flat peertopeer network architecture,while Multimedia Mobile Wireless NetworkMMWN project from GTE Internetworking usesa hierarchical network architecture that is basedon clustering techniques.Tactical Internet TI implemented by US Armyat 1997 is by far the largestscale implementationof mobile wireless multihop packet radio network97. Directsequence spreadspectrum, time division multiple access radio is used with data rates inthe tens of kilobits per second ranges, whilemodified commercial Internet protocols are usedfor networking among nodes. It reinforces theperception that commercial wireline protocolswere not good at coping with topology changes, aswell as low data rate, and high bit error ratewireless links 254.In 1999, Extending the Littoral BattlespaceAdvanced Concept Technology DemonstrationELB ACTD was another MANET deploymentexploration to demonstrate the feasibility of Marine Corps war fighting concepts that require overthehorizon OTH communications from ships atsea to Marines on land via an aerial relay. Approximately 20 nodes were configured for thenetwork, Lucents WaveLAN and VRC99A wereused to build the access and backbone networkconnections. The ELB ACTD was successful indemonstrating the use of aerial relays for connecting users beyond LOS. In the middle of 1990,with the definition of standards e.g., IEEE 802.11131, commercial radio technologies have begunto appear on the market, and the wireless researchcommunity became aware of the great commercialpotential and advantages of mobile ad hoc networking outside the military domain. Most of theexisting ad hoc networks outside the military arenahave been developed in the academic environment,but recently commercially oriented solutions started to appear see, e.g., MeshNetworks 1 andSPANworks 2.3.2. Ad hoc networking issuesIn general, mobile ad hoc networks are formeddynamically by an autonomous system of mobilenodes that are connected via wireless links withoutusing the existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. The nodes are free tomove randomly and organize themselves arbitrarily thus, the networks wireless topology maychange rapidly and unpredictably. Such a networkmay operate in a standalone fashion, or may beconnected to the larger Internet. Mobile ad hocnetworks are infrastructureless networks sincethey do not require any fixed infrastructure, suchas a base station, for their operation. In general,routes between nodes in an ad hoc network mayinclude multiple hops, and hence it is appropriateto call such networks as multihop wireless ad hocnetworks. Each node will be able to communicatedirectly with any other node that resides within itstransmission range. For communicating withnodes that reside beyond this range, the nodeI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 19needs to use intermediate nodes to relay the messages hop by hop.The ad hoc networks flexibility and conveniencedo come at a price. Ad hoc wireless networks inherit the traditional problems of wireless communications and wireless networking 132 the wireless medium has neither absolute, norreadily observable boundaries outside of whichstations are known to be unable to receive network frames the channel is unprotected from outside signals the wireless medium is significantly less reliablethan wired media the channel has timevarying and asymmetricpropagation properties hiddenterminal and exposedterminal phenomena may occur.To these problems and complexities, the multihop nature, and the lack of fixed infrastructureadd a number of characteristics, complexities, anddesign constraints that are specific to ad hoc networking 67,70Autonomous and infrastructureless. MANETdoes not depend on any established infrastructureor centralized administration. Each node operatesin distributed peertopeer mode, acts as an independent router and generates independent data.Network management has to be distributed acrossdifferent nodes, which brings added difficulty infault detection and management.Multihop routing. No default router available,every node acts as a router and forwards eachothers packets to enable information sharing between mobile hosts.Dynamically changing network topologies. Inmobile ad hoc networks, because nodes canmove arbitrarily, the network topology, which istypically multihop, can change frequently andunpredictably, resulting in route changes, frequent network partitions, and possibly packetlosses.Variation in link and node capabilities. Eachnode may be equipped with one or more radiointerfaces that have varying transmissionreceivingcapabilities and operate across different frequencybands 63,64. This heterogeneity in node radiocapabilities can result in possibly asymmetric links.In addition, each mobile node might have a different softwarehardware configuration, resultingin variability in processing capabilities. Designingnetwork protocols and algorithms for this heterogeneous network can be complex, requiring dynamic adaptation to the changing conditionspower and channel conditions, traffic loaddistribution variations, congestion, etc..Energy constrained operation. Because batteriescarried by each mobile node have limited powersupply, processing power is limited, which in turnlimits services and applications that can be supported by each node. This becomes a bigger issuein mobile ad hoc networks because, as each node isacting as both an end system and a router at thesame time, additional energy is required to forward packets from other nodes.Network scalability. Currently, popular network management algorithms were mostly designed to work on fixed or relatively small wirelessnetworks. Many mobile ad hoc network applications involve large networks with tens of thousands of nodes, as found for example, in sensornetworks and tactical networks 97. Scalability iscritical to the successful deployment of these networks. The steps toward a large network consisting of nodes with limited resources are notstraightforward, and present many challenges thatare still to be solved in areas such as addressing,routing, location management, configurationmanagement, interoperability, security, highcapacity wireless technologies, etc.3.3. Ad hoc networking researchThe specific MANET issues and constraintsdescribed above pose significant challenges in adhoc network design. A large body of research hasbeen accumulated to address these specific issues,and constraints. In this paper, we describe theongoing research activities and the challenges insome of the main research areas within the mobilead hoc network domain.

Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364As shown in the figure, the research activitieswill be grouped, according to a layered approachinto three main areas Enabling technologies Networking Middleware and applications.In addition, as shown in the figure, several issues energy management, security and cooperation, quality of service, network simulation spanall areas, and we discuss them separately.4. Enabling technologiesAs shown in Fig. 3, we can classify ad hocnetworks, depending on their coverage area, intoseveral classes Body BAN, Personal PAN,LAN1m 10m 500mBAN PANFig. 3. Ad hoc netwoLocal LAN, Metropolitan MAN and WideWAN area networks.Wide and Metropolitanarea ad hoc networksare mobile multihop wireless networks that present many challenges that are still to be solvede.g., addressing, routing, location management,security, etc., and their availability is not on immediate horizon. On the other hand, mobile adhoc networks with smaller coverage can be expected to appear soon. Specifically, adhoc singlehop BAN, PAN and LAN wireless technologiesare already common on the market 48, thesetechnologies constituting the building blocks forconstructing small, multihop, ad hoc networksthat extend their range over multiple radio hops67. For these reasons, BAN, PAN and LANtechnologies constitute the Enabling technologiesfor ad hoc networking. A detailed discussion ofBody, Personal, and Local Ad hoc Wireless NetWANRangeMAN20  50 Kmrks taxonomy.3 The Bluetooth specifications are released by the BluetoothSpecial Interest Group.I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 21works can be found in 48. Hereafter, the characteristics of these networks, and the technologiesavailable to implement them, are summarized.A body area network is strongly correlated withwearable computers. A wearable computer distributes on the body its components e.g., headmounted displays, microphones, earphones, etc.,and the BAN provides the connectivity amongthese devices. The communicating range of a BANcorresponds to the human body range, i.e., 12 m.As wiring a body is generally cumbersome, wireless technologies constitute the best solution forinterconnecting wearable devices.Personal area networks connect mobile devicescarried by users to other mobile and stationarydevices. While a BAN is devoted to the interconnection of oneperson wearable devices, a PAN isa network in the environment around the persons.APANcommunicating range is typicallyup to10m,thus enabling the interconnection of the BANsof persons close to each other, and the interconnection of a BAN with the environment around it.The most promising radios for widespread PANdeployment are in the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Spreadspectrum is typically employed to reduce interference and bandwidth reuse.Wireless LANs WLANs have a communication range typical of a single building, or a clusterof buildings, i.e., 100500 m. A WLAN shouldsatisfy the same requirements typical of any LAN,including high capacity, full connectivity amongattached stations, and broadcast capability.However, to meet these objectives, WLANs needto be designed to face some issues specific to thewireless environment, like security on the air,power consumption, mobility, and bandwidthlimitation of the air interface 235.Two different approaches can be followed in theimplementation of a WLAN an infrastructurebased approach, or an ad hoc networking one 235.An infrastructurebased architecture imposes theexistence of a centralized controller for each cell,often referred to as Access Point. The Access PointAP is normally connected to the wired network,thus providing the Internet access to mobile devices. In contrast, an ad hoc network is a peertopeer network formed by a set of stations withinthe range of each other, which dynamically configure themselves to set up a temporary network.In the ad hoc configuration, no fixed controller isrequired, but a controller may be dynamicallyelected among the stations participating in thecommunication.The success of a network technology is connected to the development of networking productsat a competitive price. A major factor in achievingthis goal is the availability of appropriate networking standards. Currently, two main standardsare emerging for ad hoc wireless networks theIEEE 802.11 standard for WLANs 133, and theBluetooth specifications 3 39 for shortrangewireless communications 15,40,179.Due to its extreme simplicity, the IEEE 802.11standard is a good platform to implement a singlehop WLAN ad hoc network. Furthermore, multihop networks covering areas of several squarekilometers can potentially be built by exploitingthe IEEE 802.11 technology. On a smaller scale,technologies such as Bluetooth can be used tobuild ad hoc wireless Body, and Personal AreaNetworks, i.e., networks that connect devices onthe person, or placed around him inside a circlewith radius of 10 m.In addition to the IEEE standards, the European Telecommunication Standard InstituteETSI has promoted the HiperLAN HIgh Performance Radio Local Area Network family ofstandard for WLANs 90. Among these, the mostinteresting standard for WLAN is HiperLAN2.The HiperLAN2 technology addresses highspeedwireless network with data rates ranging from 6 to54 Mbits. Infrastructurebased, and ad hoc networking configurations are both supported in HiperLAN2. To a large degree, HiperLAN is still atthe prototype level, and hence we will not considerit more in detail. More details on this technologycan be found in 87.293 surveys the offtheshelf technologies forconstructing ad hoc networks while 4 presents anin depth analysis of 802.11based ad hoc networks,including performance evaluation and some of theopen issues.22 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364The ad hoc network size in terms of the numberof active nodes is the other metric used to classifyMANETs. As defined in 181, we can classify thescale of an ad hoc network as smallscale i.e., 220nodes, moderatescale i.e., 20100 nodes, largescale i.e., 100 nodes, and very largescale i.e.,1000 nodes. In 107, it was shown that in anad hoc network with n nodes the pernodethroughput is bounded by cffiffiffinp, where c is aconstant. Unfortunately, experimental results 104indicate that with current technologies the pernode throughput decays as c0n168, and hence,with current technologies only small and moderatescale can be implemented in an efficient way.4.1. BluetoothThe Bluetooth technology is a defacto standard for lowcost, shortrange radio links betweenmobile PCs, mobile phones, and other portabledevices 15,179. The Bluetooth Special InterestGroup SIG releases the Bluetooth specifications.Bluetooth specifications were established by thejoint effort from over two thousand industryleading companies including 3Com, Ericsson,IBM, Intel, Lucent, Microsoft, Motorola, Nokia,Toshiba, etc. under the umbrella of Bluetooth SIG39. In addition, the IEEE 802.15 Working Groupfor Wireless Personal Area Networks approved itsfirst WPAN standard derived from the BluetoothSpecification 134. The IEEE 802.15.1 standardis based on the lower portions of the Bluetoothspecification.A Bluetooth unit, integrated into a microchip,enables wireless ad hoc communications, of voiceand data between portable andor fixed electronicdevices like computers, cellular phones, printers,and digital cameras 130. Due to its lowcosttarget, Bluetooth microchips may become embedded in virtually all consumer electronic devices inthe future.As a low cost, low power solution and withindustrywide support, Bluetooth wireless technology has already started to revolutionize thepersonal connectivity market by providing freedom from wired connectionsenabling portablelinks between mobile computers, mobile phones,portable handheld devices, and connectivity to theInternet. Eventually, picocellularbased PersonalArea Networks will able to provide services suchas realtime voice and data in a much more economical way than in existing systems.The Bluetooth system can manage a smallnumber of lowcost pointtopoint, and point tomultipoint communication links over a distanceof up to 10 m with a transmit power of less than 1mW. It operates in the globally available unlicensed ISM industrial, scientific, medical frequency band at 2.4 GHz and applies frequencyhopping for transmitting data over the air using acombination of circuit and packet switching.From a logical standpoint, Bluetooth belongsto the contentionfree tokenbased multiaccessnetworks. Into a Bluetooth network, one stationhas the role of master, and all other Bluetoothstations are slaves. The master decides which slaveis the one to have the access to the channel. Moreprecisely, a slave is authorized to deliver a singlepacket to the master only if it has received apolling message from the master. The units thatshare the same channel i.e., are synchronized tothe same master form a piconet, the fundamentalbuilding block of a Bluetooth network. A piconethas a bit rate of 1 Mbits that represents thechannel capacity including the overhead introduced by the adopted protocols, and pollingscheme. A piconet contains a master station, andup to seven active i.e., participate in data exchanging slaves, contemporarily.Inside a piconet, Bluetooth stations can establish up to three 64 Kbits synchronous voicechannels or an asynchronous data channel supporting data rates of maximal 723 Kbits asymmetric or 433 Kbits symmetric. A detailedpresentation of Bluetooth characteristics can befound in 15,48,179. The performance of a Bluetooth piconet is investigated in 27, the impact ofthe intrapiconet scheduling algorithm is documented in 27. Bluetooth performance when usedfor accessing the Internet is analyzed in 25.Apiconetconstitutesa singlehopBluetoothadhocnetwork. Multihop Bluetooth networks can beobtained by interconnecting several piconets. TheBluetooth specification defines a method for piconet interconnection the scatternet. While thecurrent Bluetooth specification defines the notionI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 23of a scatternet, it does not provide the mechanismsto construct it. A scatternet can be dynamicallyconstructed, in an ad hoc fashion, when somenodes belong at the same time to more than onepiconet, i.e., interpiconet units. The traffic between two piconets is delivered through the common nodes. The scatternet formation algorithmconstitutes a hot research issue. Solutions proposed in the literature can be subdivided in twoclasses singlehop and multihop topologies 22.Singlehop solutions assume that all Bluetoothdevices are in each other transmission range seee.g., 169,185,237. Among solutions that apply tothe more general case of multihop topologies,some schemes generate a treelike scatternetstarting from a designated node, named blueroot291. Other schemes produce topologies differentfrom a tree 135,173,208,278. The protocol proposed in 135,173 builds up a connected scatternetin which each piconet has no more than sevenslaves, but requires that each node be equippedwith additional hardware that provides to eachnode with its current geographic location e.g., aGPS receiver. The BlueStars protocol 208 proceeds in three phases the discovery device phase,the piconets formation, and the configuration ofthe piconet into a connected scatternet. Piconetsformation exploits a clusteringbased approach forthe master selection. A multiphase protocol is alsoimplemented by the BlueNet protocol 278 but itdoes not guarantee a connected scatternet evenwhen the topologies after the discovery device areconnected. Ref. 23 presents a comparison of thesolutions presented in 135,173,208,278. Finally,the BlueMesh scatternet formation protocol 207improves previous solutions from several perspectives it requires no additional hardware, itguarantees up to seven slaves per piconet, and thegenerated scatternet is more robust.A node can be synchronized with only a singlepiconet at time, and hence it can be active in morepiconets only in a timemultiplexed mode. As theinterpiconet traffic must go through the interpiconet units, the presence of the interpiconetunits, in all the piconets they belong to, must bescheduled in an efficient way 228.Capacity assignment protocols constitute thelink between scatternetformation protocols, andscatternet scheduling protocols. Once the scatternet is formed, capacity assignment protocolsoperate to determine the capacities of the scatternet links that satisfy the traffic requirements298.4.2. IEEE 802.11 networksIn 1997, the IEEE adopted the first wirelesslocal area network standard, named IEEE 802.11,with data rates up to 2 Mbps 131. Since then,several task groups designated by the letters froma, b, c, etc. have been created to extend theIEEE 802.11 standard. Task groups 802.11b and802.11a have completed their work by providingtwo relevant extensions to the original standard133, which are often referred to with the friendlyname of Wireless Fidelity WiFi. The 802.11btask group produced a standard for WLAN operations in 2.4 GHz band, with data rates up to 11Mbps and backward compatibility. This standard,published in 1999, has become an overnightsuccess, with several IEEE 802.11b productsavailable on the market currently. The 802.11atask group created a standard for WLAN operation in the 5 GHz band, with data rates up to 54Mbps. Among the other task groups, it is worthmentioning the task group 802.11e attempting toenhance the MAC with QoS features to supportvoice and video over 802.11 networks, and thetask group 802.11g that is working to develop ahigher speed extension to the 802.11b.The IEEE 802.11 standard defines two operational modes for WLANs infrastructurebased andinfrastructureless or ad hoc. Network interfacecards can be set to work in either of these modesbut not in both simultaneously. Infrastructuremode resembles cellular infrastructurebased networks. It is the mode commonly used to constructthe socalled WiFi hotspots, i.e., to providewireless access to the Internet. In the ad hoc mode,any station that is within the transmission range ofany other, after a synchronization phase, can startcommunicating. No AP is required, but if one ofthe stations operating in the ad hoc mode hasa connection also to a wired network, stationsforming the ad hoc network gain wireless access tothe Internet.4 Hereafter, the words hiddenterminal and exposedterminalwill be interchanged with the words hiddenstation andexposedstation, respectively.24 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364The IEEE 802.11 standard specifies a MAClayer and a Physical Layer for WLANs. The PHYlayer uses either direct sequence spread spectrumISM band, 2.42.4835 GHz, frequencyhoppingspread spectrum, or infrared IR pulse positionmodulation 300428,000 GHz to transmit databetween nodes. Infrared is more secure to eavesdropping, because IR transmissions require absolute lineofsight links, contrary to radio frequencytransmissions, which can penetrate walls and beintercepted by third parties unknowingly. However, infrared transmissions are more receptive tointerference, e.g., sunlight 280.The MAC layer offers two different types ofservice a contentionfree service provided by theDistributed Coordination Function DCF, and acontentionfree service implemented by the PointCoordination Function PCF. The PCF is implemented on top of DCF and is based on a pollingscheme. It uses a Point Coordinator that cyclicallypolls stations, giving them the opportunity totransmit. Since the PCF cannot be adopted in thead hoc mode, hereafter it will not be considered.The DCF provides the basic access method of the802.11 MAC protocol and is based on a CarrierSense Multiple Access with Collision AvoidanceCSMACA scheme. According to this scheme,when a node receives a packet to be transmitted, itfirst listens to the channel to ensure no other nodeis transmitting. If the channel is clear, it thentransmits the packet. Otherwise, it chooses arandom backoff value which determines theamount of time the node must wait until it is allowed to transmit its packet. During periods inwhich the channel is clear, the node decrements itsbackoff counter. When the backoff counter reacheszero, the node transmits the packet. Since theprobability that two nodes will choose the samebackoff factor is small, the probability of packetcollisions, under normal circumstances, is low.In WLAN, there is usually just one antenna forboth sending and receiving, and hence the stationsare not able to listen while sending. For this reason, in the CSMACA scheme there is no collisiondetection capability. Acknowledgment packetsACK are sent, from the receiver to the sender,to confirm that packets have been correctly received.As no collision detection mechanism is present,colliding stations always complete their transmissions, severely reducing channel utilization, as wellas throughput 50, thus presenting new challengesto conventional CSMACDbased MAC protocols. Several works have shown that an appropriatetuning of the IEEE 802.11 backoff algorithm cansignificantly increase the protocol capacity 33,51,276. The basic idea is that the random backoffduration, before attempting to transmit the packet,should be dynamically tuned by choosing thecontention window size as a function of the network congestion. By following this approach, theauthors in 26 define and evaluate an extension tothe IEEE 802.11 protocol to optimize protocolcapacity and energy consumption, showing alsothat the optimal capacity state, and the optimalenergy consumption state almost coincide.In wireless ad hoc networks that rely on a carriersensing random access protocol, such as theIEEE 802.11, the wireless medium characteristicsgenerate complex phenomena such as the hiddenstation and the exposedstation problems. 4The hiddenstation problem occurs when twoor more stations, say A and C, cannot detecteach others transmissions due to being outside ofeach other transmission range but their transmission ranges are not disjoint 263. As shown inFig. 4, a collision may occur, for example, whenthe station A and station C start transmitting towards the same receiver, station B in the figure.A virtual carriersensing mechanism based onthe RTSCTS mechanism has been included in the802.11 standard to alleviate the hiddenterminalproblem that may occur by using the physicalcarrier sensing only. Virtual carrier sensing isachieved by using two control frames, Request ToSend RTS and Clear To Send CTS, before thedata transmission is actually taken place. Specifically, before transmitting a data frame, the sourcestation sends a short control frame, named RTS,to the receiving station announcing the upcomingframe transmission. Upon receiving the RTSFig. 5. Exposedstation problem.Fig. 4. Hiddenstation problem.I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 25frame, the destination station replies by a CTSframe to indicate that it is ready to receive thedata frame. Both the RTS and CTS frames containthe total duration of the transmission, i.e., theoverall time interval needed to transmit the dataframe and the related ACK. This information canbe read by any station within the transmissionrange of either the source or the destination station. Hence, stations become aware of transmissions from hidden station, and the length of timethe channel will be used for these transmissions.The exposedterminal problem results fromsituations where a permissible transmission from amobile station sender to another station has to bedelayed due to the irrelevant transmission activitybetween two other mobile stations within senderstransmission range.Fig. 5 depicts a typical scenario where theexposed station problem may occur. Let us assume that station A and station C can heartransmissions from B, but station A cannot heartransmissions from C. Let us also assume thatstation B is transmitting to station A, and stationC has a frame to be transmitted to D. Accordingto the CSMA scheme, C senses the medium andfinds it busy because of Bs transmission, andtherefore refrains from transmitting to D, although this transmission would not cause a collision at A. The exposed station problem maythus result in loss of throughput.It is worth pointing out that the hiddenstationand the exposedstation problems are correlatedwith the Transmission Range TXrange.TXrange is the range with respect to the transmitting station within which a transmitted packetcan be successfully received. The transmissionrange is mainly determined by the transmissionpower and the radio propagation properties. Byincreasing the Transmission Range, hiddenstationproblem occurs less frequently, while the exposedstation problem becomes more important as theTXrange identifies the area affected by a singletransmission. In addition to the TransmissionRange, also the Physical Carrier Sensing Rangeand the Interference Range must be consideredto correctly understand the behavior of wirelessad hoc networks the Physical Carrier Sensing Range PCSrangeis the range with respect to the transmitting station within which the other stations detect abusy channel. It mainly depends on the sensitivity of the receiver the receive threshold and theradio propagation properties. The Interference Range IFrange is the rangewithin which a station in receive mode will be interfered with by a transmitter, and thus suffer aloss. More precisely, a transmitting station Acan interfere with a receiving station B if A iswithin the B interference range. The interferencerange is usually larger than the transmissionrange, and is a function of the path loss model.Altogether, the TXrange, PCSrange, andIFrange define the relationships existing among802.11 stations, when they transmit or receive.Table 1Transmission ranges at different data rates11 Mbps 5.5 Mbps 2 Mbps 1 MbpsTXrange 30 m 70 m 90100 m 110130 m26 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 13644.2.1. Ad hoc networkingOriginal 802.11 standardization efforts concentrated on solutions for infrastructurebasedWLANs, while little or no attention was given tothe ad hoc mode. Currently, the widespread use ofIEEE 802.11 cards makes this technology the mostinteresting offtheshelf enabler for ad hoc networks 293. This generated an extensive literature to investigate the performance of the 802.11MAC protocol in the ad hoc environment. Thesestudies have been pointed out several performance problems 4. Most of the problems are dueto the interaction of wireless channel characteristics e.g., hidden and exposedstation problems,802.11 MAC protocol mainly the backoffscheme and TCP mechanisms congestion controland timeout. As these problems are strictly connected with TCP, we defer an in depth discussionto Section 5.3 where we analyze TCP issues inmobile ad hoc networks. In the remaining part ofthis section, we will focus on the analysis of measurements taken from small ad hoc testbeds3,4.Most of the existing results in this area arebased on simulative studies whose accuracy depends on the assumptions performed in the 802.11simulation models e.g., TXrange, PCSrange,and IFrange. Measurements studies have therefore an important role in confirming simulativeobservations and understanding the behavior ofIEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks. Experimental results presented in 3,4 provide important indications in that theyi confirm results obtained from simulativestudies. Specifically, results indicate thatTCP connections may actually experience significant throughput unfairness, and evencapture of the channel by one of the connectionsii point out several aspects of 802.11b standardthat are commonly neglected in simulationstudies. These include the differences in thetransmission ranges between data and controlframes, and the differences between the transmission ranges measured in the testbeds andthe TXrange values commonly used in thenetwork simulators.Regarding point ii, Table 1 summarizes themeasurements presented in 3,4. It is worth notingthat simulation studies are typically performedassuming a 2 Mbps channel with TXrange valuesranging from 250 m 200 to 376 m 109.4.3. MAC protocol research issuesBluetooth and IEEE 802.11 technologies exemplify the two main categories in which multipleaccess networks can be categorized 123 intorandom access e.g., CSMA, CSMACD and controlled access e.g., TDMA, token passing schemes,etc.. The lack of an infrastructure, and the peertopeer nature of ad hoc networking, make randomaccess protocols the natural choice for mediumaccess control in ad hoc networks. Indeed, mostproposals of MAC protocols for ad hoc networksare based on the random access paradigm in addition, the CSMACA scheme was selected due tothe inherent flexibility of this scheme by theIEEE802.11 committee as the basis for its standards. On the other hand, demand assignmentaccess schemes even though generally more complex are more suitable for environments that needguarantees on the Quality of Service QoS perceived by its users. The Bluetooth technology thatis designed to support, beyond data traffic, alsodelay sensitive applications e.g., voice adoptsa TDMA scheme with an implicit tokenpassingscheme for the slots assignment inside a piconet.Bluetooth and IEEE 802.11 have been designedfor singlehop WPANs and WLANs, respectively,and their use in a multihop environment is notoptimized. The design of MAC protocols for amultihop ad hoc environment is a hot researchissue. In the following subsections we summarizesthe ongoing research activities in this field.4.3.1. Random access MAC protocolsIn recent years a large number of random accessMAC protocols have been developed to cope withI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 27problems that occur when random access protocolare used over wireless channels. A number of improved protocols such as MACA multiple accesswith collision avoidance protocol, MACAWMACA with CW optimization, FAMA flooracquisition multiple access, MACAPR andMACABI multiple access with collision avoidance by invitation protocol 31,95,146,160,260have been proposed over the years to resolve themultiaccess problems over wireless channelsmainly the hiddenstation phenomena, and improve channel performance. MACAW is one ofthe more promising protocols in this area 31MACAW has been proposed to extend MACA byadding link level ACKs and a less aggressivebackoff policy 31. RTSCTSbased mechanism isthe solution emerging from these studies. Severalvariations and analyses of the RTSCTS schemecan be found in literature see for example31,96,105,108, and an RTSCTS mechanism isincluded in the 802.11 standard to reduce the impact of the hidden stations. This is achieved byreserving a large portion of the channel around thereceiver and the sender, thus reducing the interference probability on the ongoing transmission.However, this mechanism, by reserving a largeportion of the channel for a single transmission,increases the number of other nodes in the vicinitythat remain blocked as they are exposed to thissingle transmission. Indeed, by extending the areain which the physical or logical carrier sensing iseffective the hiddenstation phenomenon is diminished, while the exposed stations phenomenonincreases.It is also worth noting that most of the proposed random access protocols have been designedby taking into account the transmission rangeonly, without considering the fact that physicalcarrier sensing is typically much larger. If thePCSRange is about twice the TXRange see forexample the model of the 802.11 physical layerimplemented in NS2 200 and Glomosim 109,the stations that are in the TXRange of the receiver will observe the channel busy when a sendertoreceiver transmission occurs, and hence there isno need to use the virtual carrier sensing implemented by the CTS packet. A similar observationapplies for the receivertosender ACK transmission. These observations have also been confirmedby experimental results indicating that phenomenaoccurring at the physical layer make the physicalcarrier sensing effective even if the transmittingstations are apparently hidden from each other48.A more careful understanding of the phenomena that occur at the physical layer, and that canimpact the MAC design, is fundamental for designing random access protocols that can efficiently operate in multihop ad hoc networkswhere the status of the channel observed by agiven station A is affected at the same time byseveral other stations. The type of impact being afunction of the stations location in the transmission range, interference range or physical carriersensing range of station A. Furthermore, thenumber of interfering stations and their impactchange dynamically.To summarize, while solutions exist for solving the hiddenstation phenomena, several otherissues still need to be addressed, the exposed stations phenomenon being one of the most important. In addition, the existence of physical andinterference ranges larger than the transmissionrange must be carefully considered in the MACdesign.Seedex 226 is an interesting approach to avoidcollisions and the hiddenstation problem withoutmaking explicit channel reservations. Seedex assumes a slotted channel, and its key idea is todefine, at each station, a random transmissionschedule i.e., the node will use the channel slotsaccording a Bernoulli process with parameter pthat is then propagated to the twohop neighbors.In this way, all nodes are aware of the transmissions scheduled by their twohop neighbors, andhence can tune their transmission parameters tooptimize the channel throughput. The publishingof stations random schedules is achieved in a veryefficient way by summarizing it through a sequenceof pseudorandom numbers. By exploiting theproperties of pseudorandom number generators156,165, publishing a node scheduler can besimply translated to publishing the seed of itspseudorandom number generator.A novel and promising direction for reducing the interference among stations and the28 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364exposedstation phenomenon, is based on the useof directional antennas 222. Research in wirelessad hoc networks typically assumes the use ofomnidirectional antennas at all nodes. Withomnidirectional antennas, while two nodes arecommunicating using a given channel, the MACprotocol e.g., IEEE 802.11 requires that all othernodes in the vicinity stay silent. With directionalantennas, two pairs of nodes located in each others vicinity may potentially simultaneously accessthe channel, depending on the directions oftransmission. Directional antennas can adaptivelyselect radio signals of interest in specific directions,while filtering out unwanted interference fromother directions. This can increase spatial reuse ofthe wireless channel. In addition, the higher powergain of directional antennas with respect to omnidirectional antennas extends the node transmission range 221.Ref. 78 extends the 802.11 MAC for usingit with directional antennas. The basic protocol,named Directional MAC DMAC operates in twophases. The first phase based on RTSCTS exchange is used for tuning the receiver antenna onthe sender direction. During the first phase, thereceiver listens to the channel omnidirectionally.After this phase, directional transmissions areused. Similar schemes have been proposed in 265.MMAC 78 extends the basic DMAC protocolby using multihop RTSs to establish a directional link between sender and receiver, then CTS,DATA and ACK are transmitted over a single hopby exploiting the directional antennas gain. TheReceiverOriented Multiple Access protocol 34exploits the multilink feature of directional antennas. In this protocol a node can commenceseveral simultaneous communication sessions byforming up to K links, where K indicates the number of antenna beams.The work in 222 presents an updated, and indepth analysis of the state of the art of antennabeamforming and power control in ad hoc networks. The author points out the most significantproblems related to the introduction of beamforming and power control in the ad hoc scenario,and identifies which are from the MAC layerperspective the most relevant gains in systemperformance.Finally, beyond collision avoidance, other optimization studies have been done at the MAC layerlevel to improve MANET performance, includingMAC improvement, algorithms used to reducemobile node energy consumption 73, and the useof power control for improving power saving atMAC level, see 144 and the references herein.4.3.2. Controlled access MAC protocolsSeveral controlled access schemes exist, e.g.,TDMA, CDMA, tokenpassing, etc. 123. Amongthese, TDMA is the most commonly used in adhoc networks. In the TDMA approach, thechannel is generally organized in frames, whereeach frame contains a fixed number of time slots.The mobile hosts negotiate a set of TDMA slots inwhich to transmit. If a centralized controller exists,it is in charge of assigning the slots to the nodes inthe area it controls. In this way transmissions arecollisions free, and it is possible to schedule nodetransmissions according to fairness and QoS criteria. TDMA has been adopted, for example, inclusterbased multihop ad hoc networks seeSection 5.2.4 on clustering, where the clusterheadassigns the time slots to the nodes of its cluster taking into consideration their bandwidth requirements. The absence of collisions, and anappropriate scheduling for slots assignment guarantee bounded delays 113. In a mobile networkenvironment the reassignment of slots after topology changes makes a legacy TDMA schemevery inefficient. These inefficiencies can be avoidedin an elegant way by applying the Time SpreadMultiple Access TSMA protocol. This algorithmuses only global network parameters the numberof nodes in the network and the maximum numberof neighbors each node may have to define theslots assignment to nodes, in this way no recomputation is required due to nodes mobility.Specifically, with TSMA, multiple slots are assigned to each node inside a frame. Collisions mayoccur while a node is transmitting inside its assigned slots, but by exploiting the properties offinite fields, the TSMA scheme guarantees a collisionfree transmission slot to each neighbor withina single frame 57. This algorithm is mainly suitable for ad hoc networks with thousands of nodeswith a sparse topology. A similar method is preI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 29sented in 139. The main limitation of TSMAlikeschemes is that the global network parameters aregenerally unknown and difficult to predict. Forthis reason, distributed algorithms that work witha partial knowledge of the network status e.g.,number of neighbors appear more suitable fordynamic ad hoc networks 72,292. Dynamic protocols typically operate in two phases. In the firstphase a dedicated set of slots is used on a contention basis for making slots reservations. Aftera successful contention, a node can access one ormore transmission slots.5. NetworkingTo cope with the selforganizing, dynamic,volatile, peertopeer communication environmentin a MANET, most of the main functionalities ofthe Networking protocols i.e., network and transport protocols in the Internet architecture need tobe redesigned. In this section we provide an outline of the main research issues in these areas, andsurvey the existing literature.The aim of the networking protocols is to usethe onehop transmission services provided by theenabling technologies to construct endtoendreliable delivery services, from a sender to oneor more receivers. To establish an endtoendcommunication, the sender needs to locate thereceiver inside the network. The purpose of a location service is to dynamically map the logicaladdress of the receiver device to its current location in the network. Current solutions generallyadopted to manage mobile terminals in infrastructure networks are generally inadequate, andnew approaches have to be found.Once, a user is located, routing and forwardingalgorithms must be provided to route the information through the MANET. Finally, the lowreliability of communications due to wirelesscommunications, users mobility, etc., and thepossibility of network congestion require a redesign of Transport Layer mechanisms.In this section, we survey these various aspectsof the research on networking protocols, i.e., location service Section 5.1, routing and forwarding Section 5.2, and TCP Section 5.3.5.1. Location servicesA Location Service answers queries aboutnodes location. In legacy mobile networks 158e.g., GSM, Mobile IP, the presence of a fixedinfrastructure led to the diffusion of twotierschemes to track the position of mobile nodes.Examples are the Home Location RegisterVisitorLocation Register approach used in GSM networks, and the Home AgentForeign Agentapproach for Mobile IP networks. Efficient implementations of these approaches use centralizedservers. In a mobile ad hoc network, these solutions are not useful, and new approaches have tobe found for mobility management 198.A simple solution to node location is based onflooding the location query through the network.Of course, flooding does not scale, and hence thisapproach is only suitable for limited size networks,where frequently flooded packets have only alimited impact on network performance. Controlling the flooding area can help to refine thetechnique. This can be achieved by gradually increasing, until the node is located, the number ofhops involved in the flooding propagation.The flooding approach constitutes a reactivelocation service in which no location informationis maintained inside the network. The locationservice maintenance cost is negligible, and all thecomplexity is associated with query operations. Onthe other hand, proactive location services subdivide the complexity in the two phases. Proactiveservices construct and maintain inside the networkdata structures that store the location informationof each node. By exploiting the data structures, thequery operations are highly simplified.DREAM 30 is an example of a proactive location service in which all the complexity is in thefirst phase. All the network nodes maintain thelocation information of all the other nodes. To thisend, each node uses the flooding technique tobroadcast its location. To reduce the overhead, anode can control the frequency with which itssends its positionupdate messages, and the areanumber of hops to which the update messagesare delivered. In this way, the location informationaccuracy decreases with the distance from the nodebut this shortcoming is balanced by the distance30 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364effect the greater the distance separating twonodes, the slower they appear to be moving withrespect to each other 30.The location services presented in 106,136,164,213 select for each node a subset of network nodesthat are designed to store its location. These worksfollow two main approaches virtual home andgrid.Refs. 106,136 use a similar approach to implement the home location server of a node bydistributing this function on several nodes insidethe ad hoc networks. Specifically, each node isunivocally associated with an area inside thead hoc network i.e., its virtual home in which itsinformation is stored. The association between anode and its virtual home area is obtained througha hash function known to all nodes applied to thenode identifier. The query related to a node location is therefore directed to its virtual home wherethe node information is stored.Refs. 164,213 assume that a gridlike structureis superposed on the ad hoc network. By exploitingthe grid structure the location service is organizedin a hierarchy of squares that simplifies the updateand query operations. For example, in 164, thegrid hierarchy and the node identifiers define foreach mobile node a small set of other nodes itslocation servers designed to contain its currentlocation. A node has no knowledge of the identityof its location servers, but the protocol defines adistributed and independent procedure to identifythem. A node only forwards its position updatestoward grid squares. Then, locally to each selectedgrid square, the distributed procedure finds onelocation server for that node. The same distributedprocedure is also used to locate the node locationserver to solve the queries.Ref. 112 contains an updated overview ofLocation Services for ad hoc networks.5.2. Ad hoc routing and forwardingThe highly dynamic nature of a mobile ad hocnetwork results in frequent and unpredictablechanges of network topology, adding difficulty andcomplexity to routing among the mobile nodes.The challenges and complexities, coupled with thecritical importance of routing protocol in establishing communications among mobile nodes,make routing area the most active research areawithin the MANET domain. Numerous routingprotocols and algorithms have been proposed, andtheir performance under various network environments, and traffic conditions have been studiedand compared.Several surveys and comparative analysis ofMANET routing protocols have been published88,233. Ref. 205 provides a comprehensive overview of routing solutions for ad hoc network,while an updated and in depth analysis of routingprotocols for mobile ad hoc network is presentedin 88.A preliminary classification of the routing protocols can be done via the type of cast property,i.e., whether they use aUnicast, Geocast,Multicast,or Broadcast forwarding 217.Broadcast is the basic mode of operation over awireless channel each message transmitted on awireless channel is generally received by allneighbors located within onehop from the sender.The simplest implementation of the broadcastoperation to all network nodes is by naive flooding, but this may cause the broadcast storm problem due to redundant rebroadcast 203. Schemeshave been proposed to alleviate this problem byreducing redundant broadcasting. Ref. 252 surveys existing methods for flooding a wireless network intelligently.Unicast forwarding means a onetoone communication, i.e., one source transmits data packetsto a single destination. This is the largest class ofrouting protocols found in ad hoc networks.Multicast routing protocols come into playwhen a node needs to send the same message, orstream of data, to multiple destinations. Geocastforwarding is a special case of multicast that isused to deliver data packets to a group of nodessituated inside a specified geographical area.Nodes may join or leave a multicast group as desired, on the other hand, nodes can join or leavea geocast group only by entering or leaving thecorresponding geographical region. From an implementation standpoint, geocasting is a form ofrestricted broadcasting messages are deliveredto all the nodes that are inside a given region. Thiscan be achieved by routing the packets from theI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 31source to a node inside the geocasting region, andthen applying a broadcast transmission inside theregion. Positionbased or locationaware routingalgorithms, by providing an efficient solution forforwarding packets towards a geographical position, constitute the basis for constructing geocasting delivery services.This section presents the various aspects ofrouting algorithms. Sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2 provide an overview of unicast and multicast routingprotocols, respectively. Positionbased routing algorithms are discussed in Section 5.2.3. Finally, inSection 5.2.4 we present the clustering techniquesused to construct a hierarchy inside an ad hocnetwork to increase the scalability of networkingfunctions.5.2.1. Unicast routingA primary goal of unicast routing protocols isthe correct and efficient route establishment andmaintenance between a pair of nodes, so thatmessages may be delivered reliably and in a timelymanner. This is the target of classical Internet linkstate e.g., OSPF and distancevector e.g., RIProuting protocols 234, but MANET characteristics make the direct use of these protocols infeasible 257. Internet protocols have been designedfor networks with almost static topologies therefore unable to keep pace with frequent link changes in ad hoc environment, where routingprotocols run in specialized nodes with plentifulresources, i.e., energy, memory, processing capability, etc. On the other hand, MANET routingprotocols must operate in networks with highlydynamic topologies where routing algorithms runon resourceconstrained devices. Providing routingprotocols for MANETs has been, in the last 10years, perhaps the most active research area for thead hoc network community. A large number ofrouting protocols have been designed, either bymodifying Internet routing protocols, or proposing new routing approaches. The number of proposed protocols is too large to be surveyed in thisarticle. Below, we therefore present a highlevelclassification of MANET routing protocols, andthen sketch some representative protocols for eachclass. More details on MANET routing protocolscan be found in 18,88,233.MANET environment and characteristics, suchas mobility and bandwidthenergy limitations, ledto defining a set of desirable characteristics that arouting protocol should have to optimize the limited resources i.e., minimal control overhead,minimal processing overhead, and loop freedomprevention to avoid wasting resources due topackets spinning around in the network, and copewith dynamic topologies efficient dynamic topology establishment and maintenance, rapid routeconvergence, and possibly supporting multipleroutes. Other important features for a routingprotocol are scalability, supporting unidirectionallinks, security and reliability, Quality of Servicesupport 65,88,182.MANET routing protocols are typically subdivided into two main categories proactive routingprotocols and reactive ondemand routing protocols233. Proactive routing protocols are derived fromlegacy Internet distancevector and linkstateprotocols. They attempt to maintain consistentand updated routing information for every pair ofnetwork nodes by propagating, proactively, routeupdates at fixed time intervals. As the routing information is usually maintained in tables, theseprotocols are sometimes referred to as TableDriven protocols. Reactive on demand routing protocols, on the other hand, establish the route to adestination only when there is a demand for it. Thesource node through the route discovery processusually initiates the route requested. Once a routehas been established, it is maintained until eitherthe destination becomes inaccessible along everypath from the source, or until the route is nolonger used, or expired 88,233.PROACTIVE ROUTING PROTOCOLS. The maincharacteristic of these protocols is the constantmaintaining of a route by each node to all othernetwork nodes. The route creation and maintenance are performed through both periodic andeventdriven e.g., triggered by links breakagesmessages. Representative proactive protocols are88,233 DestinationSequenced DistanceVectorDSDV, Optimized Link State Routing OLSR,and Topology Dissemination Based on ReversePath Forwarding TBRPF.The DestinationSequenced DistanceVectorDSDV protocol 206 is a distancevector32 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364protocol with extensions to make it suitable toMANET. Every node maintains a routing tablewith one route entry for each destination in whichthe shortest path route based on number of hopsis recorded. To avoid routing loops, a destinationsequence number is used. A node increments itssequence number whenever a change occurs in itsneighborhood. This number is used to select amongalternative routes for the same destination. Nodesalways select the route with the greatest number,thus selecting the most recent information 206.CGSR extends DSDV with clustering see Section 5.2.4 to increase the protocol scalability 77.In addition, heuristic methods like priority tokenscheduling, gateway code scheduling, and pathreservation 77 are used to improve the protocolsperformance. Unfortunately, setting up the structure in a highly dynamic environment can adversely affect protocol performance since thestructure might not persist for a very long time.WRP is another loopfree proactive protocolwhere four tables are used to maintain distance,link cost, routes and message retransmission information 186. Loop avoidance is based onproviding for the shortest path to each destinationboth the distance and the secondtolast hoppredecessor information.Despite the variance in the number of routingtables used, and the difference in routing information maintained in these tables, proactiverouting protocols like DSDV, CGSR and WRPare all distance vector shortestpath based, andhave the same degree of complexity during linkfailures and additions.OLSR protocol 142 is an optimization forMANET of legacy linkstate protocols. The keypoint of the optimization is the multipoint relayMPR. Each node identifies among its neighborsits MPRs. By flooding a message to its MPRs, anode is guaranteed that the message, when retransmitted by the MPRs, will be received by all itstwohop neighbors. Furthermore, when exchanging linkstate routing information, a node listsonly the connections to those neighbors that haveselected it as MPR, i.e., its Multipoint Relay Selector set. The protocol selects bidirectional linksfor routing, hence avoiding packet transfer overunidirectional links.Like OLSR, TBRPF 43 is a linkstate routingprotocol that employs a different overhead reduction technique. Each node computes a shortestpath tree to all other nodes, but to optimizebandwidth only part of the tree is propagated tothe neighbors, for details see 88.The FSR protocol 151,211 is also an optimization over linkstate algorithms using fisheyetechnique. In essence, FSR propagates link stateinformation to other nodes in the network basedon how far away defined by scopes which aredetermined by number of hops the nodes are. Theprotocol will propagate link state informationmore frequently to nodes that are in a closer scope,as opposed to ones that are further away. Thismeans that a route will be less accurate the furtheraway the node is, but once the message gets closerto the destination, the accuracy increases. LANMAR 212,258 builds on top of FSR and achieveshierarchical routing by partitioning the networknodes into different mobility groups a landmarknode is elected within each group to keep track ofwhich logical subnet a node belongs to, and facilitate intergroup routing FSR is used for intragroup routing.REACTIVE ROUTING PROTOCOLS. Theseprotocols depart from the legacy Internet approach. To reduce the overhead, the route betweentwo nodes is discovered only when it is needed.Representative reactive routing protocols includeDynamic Source Routing DSR, Ad hoc On Demand Distance Vector AODV, Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm TORA, AssociativityBased Routing ABR, Signal Stability RoutingSSR.DSR is a loopfree, source based, on demandrouting protocol 141, where each node maintainsa route cache that contains the source routeslearned by the node. The route discovery process isonly initiated when a source node do not alreadyhave a valid route to the destination in its routecache entries in the route cache are continuallyupdated as new routes are learned. Source routingis used for packets forwarding.AODV is a reactive improvement of the DSDVprotocol. AODV minimizes the number of routebroadcasts by creating routes ondemand 218, asopposed to maintaining a complete list of routes asI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 33in the DSDV algorithm. Similar to DSR, routediscovery is initiated ondemand, the route requestis then forward by the source to the neighbors, andso on, until either the destination or an intermediate node with a fresh route to the destination, arelocated.DSR has a potentially larger control overheadand memory requirements than AODV since eachDSR packet must carry full routing path information, whereas in AODV packets only containthe destination address. On the other hand, DSRcan utilize both asymmetric and symmetric linksduring routing, while AODV only works withsymmetric links this is a constraint that may bedifficult to satisfy in mobile wireless environments. In addition, nodes in DSR maintain intheir cache multiple routes to a destination, afeature helpful during link failure. In general, bothAODV and DSR work well in small to mediumsize networks with moderate mobility.TORA is another sourceinitiated ondemandrouting protocol built on the concept of link reversal of the Directed Acyclic Graph ACG 209.In addition to being loopfree and bandwidth efficient, TORA has the property of being highlyadaptive and quick in route repair during linkfailure, while providing multiple routes for anydesired sourcedestination pair. These propertiesmake it especially suitable for large, highly dynamic, mobile ad hoc environments with densenodes populations. The limitation in TORAsapplicability comes from its reliance on synchronized clocks. If a node does not have a GPS positioning system, or some other external timesource, or if the time source fails, the algorithmfails.ABR protocol is also a loop free protocol, but ituses a new routing metric termed degree of association stability in selecting routes, so that routediscovered can be longerlived route, thus morestable and requiring less updates subsequently.The limitation of ABR comes mainly from a periodic beaconing used to establish the associationstability metrics, which may result in additionalenergy consumption. Signal Stability AlgorithmSSA 79 is basically an ABR protocol with theadditional property of routes selection using thesignal strength of the link.In general, ondemand reactive protocols aremore efficient than proactive ones. Ondemandprotocols minimize control overhead and powerconsumption since routes are only establishedwhen required. By contrast, proactive protocolsrequire periodic route updates to keep informationcurrent and consistent in addition, maintainmultiple routes that might never be needed, addingunnecessary routing overheads.Proactive routing protocols provide betterquality of service than ondemand protocols. Asrouting information is constantly updated in theproactive protocols, routes to every destination arealways available and uptodate, and hence endtoend delay can be minimized. For ondemandprotocols, the source node has to wait for the routeto be discovered before communication can happen. This latency in route discovery might be intolerable for realtime communications.Ref. 233 presents a set of tables that summarize the difference among these various protocolsin terms of the complexity, route update patternsand capabilities. The above considerations pointto proactive protocols being suitable for smallscale static networks, while reactive protocols,such as DSR and AODV can normally work wellin medium size networks with moderate mobility88. In the last few years, according to these observations, more attention was given to reactiveprotocol design, as they result in a more scalablesolution. However, a novel perspective on theoverhead of routing protocols is presented in247,251. Here the authors consider also the effectintroduced by the suboptimality of routes, accounted for as the additional bandwidth requiredfor using a suboptimal path. From this perspective, the authors formulate an analytical modelwhose solution opens a design space for scalablelinkstate routing strategies based on limited dissemination of linkstate information.In addition to proactive and reactive protocols,another class of unicast routing protocols that canbe identified is that of hybrid protocols. The ZoneBased Hierarchical Link State Routing ProtocolZRP 124 is an example of hybrid protocol thatcombines both proactive and reactive approachesthus trying to bring together the advantages of thetwo approaches. ZRP defines around each node a34 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364zone that contains the neighbors within a givennumber of hops from the node. Proactive and reactive algorithms are used by the node to routepackets within and outside the zone, respectively.5.2.2. MulticastingMulticasting is an efficient communication service for supporting multipoint applications e.g.,software distributions, audiovideo conferencingin the Internet. In MANET, the role of multicastservices is potentially even more important duethe bandwidth and energy savings that can beachieved through multicast packets delivery 76.MANET multicast research started by adaptingInternet existing approaches to ad hoc networks.Two main approaches are used for multicastrouting in fixed networks groupshared tree andsourcespecific tree. In both cases, multicast treesare constructed to interconnect all the members ofthe multicast group. Data is delivered along thetree paths to reach all group members. The sourcespecific approach maintains, for each source, a treetowards all its receivers. In the groupshare, asingle tree is constructed for the whole group e.g.,regardless the sources location. Internet multicastrouting protocols works well under static configurations supporting multicast route under highlydynamic network configurations is a big challengefor ad hoc networking researchers 62. Severalmulticast protocols for ad hoc networks based ontrees have been proposed by adapting those existing for fixed networks. Representative treebased multicast protocols are Multicast AODVMAODV 229 and AMRIS 277. Both protocols are an ondemand, and construct a shareddelivery tree to support multiple senders and receivers within a multicast session. Energyefficientalgorithms for the construction of multicast treesare proposed and evaluated in 275.The topology of a wireless mobile network canbe very dynamic, and hence the maintenance ofconnected multicast routing tree may cause largeoverheads. To avoid this, a different approachbased on meshes has been proposed. Meshes aremore suitable for dynamic environments becausethey support more connectivity than trees, thusavoiding drawbacks of multicast trees, e.g., intermittent connectivity, traffic concentration, or frequent tree reconfiguration. Although multicastmeshes perform better than multicast trees in dynamic networks, mesh mechanism is more inclinedto form routing loops in addition, approaches tomesh building based on flooding incurs excessiveoverhead in large networks 187.Representative meshbased multicast routingprotocols include CoreAssisted Mesh ProtocolCAMP 187, and the Ondemand MulticastRouting Protocol ODMRP 242. These protocols build routing meshes to disseminate multicastpackets within groups. The difference is that ODMRP uses flooding to build the mesh, whileCAMP uses one or more core nodes to assist inbuilding the mesh, instead of flooding.To avoid the significant delay in route recoverycaused by link failures, in 241 the authors explorethe possibility of using a set of precalculated alternate trees. When a links break, another tree,which does not includes the failed link, is immediately utilized. An alternative approach toavoiding problems related to treemesh maintenance is implemented in the Explicit Multicastingprotocol 138. This protocol is designed to operatein a stateless manner where no intermediate nodeneeds to maintain multicast forwarding paths.5.2.3. Locationaware routingLocationaware routing protocols use, duringthe forwarding operations, the nodes positioni.e., geographical coordinates provided by GPS147 or other mechanisms 60,248. Specifically, anode selects the next hop for packets forwardingby using the physical position of its onehopneighbors, and the physical position of the destination node. The packets are forwarded to aneighbor in the receiver direction for this reason,these routing protocols are also referred to aspositionbased or geographic approaches. Generally, a location service is used to solve the queriesabout the current position of the networks node.Locationaware routing does not require routesestablishment and maintenance. No routing information is stored. The use of geolocation information avoids networkwide searches, as bothcontrol and data packets are sent towards theknown geographical coordinates of the destinationnode. These features make locationaware routingI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 35protocols quickly adaptive to route changes, andmore scalable than unicast protocols such asAODV, DSDV, DSR 110.Three main strategies can be identified in locationaware routing protocols 274 greedy forwarding, directed flooding and hierarchical routing.The basic idea behind these algorithms is to forward a packet towards nodes that are closer tothe destination, then itself. Greedy forwarding anddirected flooding algorithms forward the packet toone or more neighbors, respectively. Hierarchicalrouting algorithms are a combination of positionbased and nonpositionbased routing algorithms.Locationaware routing is typically used on longdistances i.e., when the forwarding node and thereceiver are far away, while a nonpositionbasedalgorithm is used at local level i.e., the packet isclose to the receiver.A large number of locationaware algorithmshave been proposed in the literature see 111, andthe reference herein hereafter we introduce somerouting algorithms representative of the threeclasses. More details on these protocols can befound in 110,111,262,274.GREEDY FORWARDING. In this type of strategies a node tries to forward the packet to one ofits neighbors that is closer to the destination thanitself. If more than one closer node exists, differentchoices are possible. If, on the other hand, nocloser neighbor exists, new rules are included in thegreedy strategies to find an alternative route. Toselect the next node, when more then one closernode exists, several policies have been proposed.The Most Forward within Radius MFR policy264 maximizes the progress by forwarding thepackets to the node closest to the destination.On theother hand, by taking into consideration thatthe transmission at the maximum distance impliesthe maximum transmission power and hence themaximization of the collision probability withother nodes, the Nearest with Forward ProgressNFP scheme 121 applies a selection of the nextnode that tries to maximize the success probability.NFP sends the packet to the node closer to thesender. The transmission can thus be accomplishedwith minimum power hence the interference withthe other nodes is minimized, while the probabilityof a successful transmission is maximized.Finally, in the compass routing scheme 152 thenext node is selected to minimize the spatial distance. In this scheme the packet is forwarded tothe neighbor that is closer to the straight linejoining the sender to the receiver.Greedy policies enter into a deadlock whenpacket arrives at a node corresponding to a localoptimum, i.e., no neighbor exists that is closer tothe destination than the current forwarding node.To exit from the deadlock, greedy policies aresupplemented with extra rules such as the selection of the node with the least negative progress264, and the discard of the packets that arrive ata local optimum 121. In the former case, policiesto avoid routing loops are also introduced.By combining the above rules for the choice ofthe next neighbor and to exit from local optima,several routing algorithms based on the greedyforwarding principle have been defined. TheGPRS and the face algorithms use the MFRscheme for selecting the next node. A greedy forwarding is applied up to a local optimum, thensimilar strategies are applied by the two algorithmsto exit from this state, and finding a node thathelps in progressing to the destination.The geographical distance routing GEDIRuses both the MFR and the compass routingschemes. In addition, it uses rules to avoid loopsand to exit from local optima 246.DIRECTED FLOODING. With directed floodingnodes forward the packets to all neighbors that arelocated in the direction of the destination.DREAM 30 and LAR 153 are two routing algorithms that apply this principle. However, LARuses directed flooding only for route discovery,while DREAM applies a restricted flooding forpackets delivery. In the DREAM algorithm, theforwarding node, by using the information aboutthe destination nodes position, determines an expected region for the destination. The expectedregion is a circle centered on the last known receiver location, which represents the area wherethe receiver should be, taking into account thenode mobility from its last known position. Apacket is then forwarded toward the expected region. Similarly, LAR defines the expected zone inwhich the destination node is expected to be located. From the expected zone, the algorithm36 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364identifies a request zone. LAR floods the routesearching packets only inside the request zone.HIERARCHICAL ROUTING. The locationproxy routing protocol also referred to as Gridrouting 177, and the Terminode routing protocol 21 are hierarchical routing protocols in whichrouting is structured in two layer. Both protocolsapply different rules to long and shortdistancerouting, respectively. Locationaware routing isused for routing on long distances, while when apacket arrives close to the destination a proactivedistance vector scheme is adopted.5.2.4. ClusteringAny device with a microprocessor can in principle be an ad hoc network node. Supporting alarge number of heterogeneous users is thus a requirement for future ad hoc networks. In a largenetwork, flat routing schemes produce an excessiveamount of information that can saturate the network. In addition, given the nodes heterogeneity,nodes may have highly variable amount of resources, and this naturally produces a hierarchy intheir roles inside the network. Nodes with largecomputational and communication power, andpowerful batteries are more suitable for supporting the ad hoc network functions e.g., routingthan small embeddedsystems.Clusterbased routing is an interesting solutionto address nodes heterogeneity, and to limit theamount of routing information that propagatesinside the network. The basic idea behind clustering is to group the network nodes into a number ofoverlapping clusters. This enables the aggregationof the routing information, and consequently increases the routing algorithms scalability. Specifically, clustering makes possible a hierarchicalrouting in which paths are recorded betweenclusters instead of between nodes this increasesthe routes lifetime, thus decreasing the amount ofrouting control overhead 88.Clustering was introduced in 1980s to providedistributed control in mobile radio networks 32.In its original definition, inside the cluster onenode is in charge of coordinating the cluster activities clusterhead. Beyond the clusterhead, inside the cluster, we have ordinary nodes that havedirect access only to this one clusterhead, andgateways, i.e., nodes that can hear two or moreclusterheads 32. A simple clustering distributedalgorithm is based on the nodes identifier ID. Byassuming that a distinct ID is associated to eachnode, the node with the lowest ID in a neighborhood is elected as the clusterhead 113. Thisguarantees that two clusterheads cannot hear eachother. As all nodes in the cluster can hear theclusterhead, all intercluster communications occurin at most two hops, while intracluster communications occurs through the gateway nodes. Ordinary nodes send the packets to their clusterhead,that either distributes the packets inside the cluster, or if the destination is outside the clusterforwards them to a gateway node to be deliveredto the other clusters.By replacing the nodes with clusters, existingrouting protocols can be directly applied to thenetwork. Only gateways and clusterheads participate in the propagation of routing controlupdatemessages. In dense networks this significantly reduces the routing overhead, thus solving scalability problems for routing algorithms in large ad hocnetworks.Several dynamic clustering strategies based onthese ideas have been proposed in the literature,e.g., 13,56,113. These strategies mainly differ inthe criteria used to organize and maintain thecluster.Clusterheads act as local coordinators, and inaddition to support packets routing and forwarding, they may resolve channel scheduling, performpower measurementcontrol, maintain time division frame synchronization, 113,161. For example, CDMATDMA techniques can be appliedinside ad hoc networks by assigning a differentcode to each cluster, and using inside each cluster aTDMA scheduler managed by the clusterhead113.A clusterhead concentrates the traffic of acluster, and as a consequence it may become acluster bottleneck. This problem can be avoidedby eliminating the clusterhead role, and adoptinga fully distributed clustering approach, see e.g.,154,161.A key point in the use of clustering techniquesin a mobile environment is the maintenance ofthe network topology i.e., nodes grouping, andI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 37identification of clusterheads, and gateways, ifnecessary in the presence of various networkevents mainly, the nodesmobility. The clusteringstrategies proposed in the literature, generally apply static criteria for the implementation of clustering algorithms without taking directly intoconsideration the node mobility. Node mobility isa critical point because the membership of a nodeto a cluster changes over time due to the nodemobility. Rearrangement of clusters may introduce excessive overheads that may nullify clustering benefits. To cope with the mobility problem, in199 the node mobility is directly included insidethe a tCluster clustering algorithm. The objective of a tCluster is to create and maintain atopology that adapts to node mobility. Specifically, a tCluster partitions the network intoclusters that provide some guarantees on the pathstability with respect to nodes mobility. In detail,the nodes belonging to a cluster are expected to bereachable along paths internal to the cluster, andthese paths have a lowerbounded availability, i.e.,they are expected to be available for a period oftime t, with a probabilityPa 199. Intraclusterrouting can be implemented with proactive algorithms, while intercluster routing is based on a ondemand protocol.5.3. TCP issuesTCP is an effective connectionoriented transport control protocol that provides the essentialflow control and congestion control required toensure reliable packet delivery 234. TCP wasoriginally designed to work in fixed networks.Because error rate in wired network is quite low,TCP uses packet loss as an indication for networkcongestion, and deals with this effectively bymaking corresponding transmission adjustment toits congestion window. Numerous enhancementsand optimizations have been proposed over thepast few years to improve TCP performance forinfrastructurebased WLANs, and cellular networking environments, see e.g., 20,44,46,47. Theissues and solutions for using TCP over mobilenetworks are surveyed in 119. Refs. 5,6 propose and evaluate solutions, based on the indirect TCP model, for the joint optimization ofTCP performance and power saving in WiFi hotspots.Infrastructurebased wireless networks are 1hop wireless networks where a mobile device usesthe wireless medium to access the fixed infrastructure e.g., the access point. Although thereare a number of differences between infrastructureand ad hoc networks, many of these proposedsolutions can be exploited also in the mobile adhoc networks. For example, avoiding the invocation of congestion control mechanisms duringpacket losses by simply retransmitting the lostpackets. In addition, the mobile multihop ad hocenvironment brings fresh challenges to TCP protocol. The dynamic topologies, and the interactionof MAC protocol mechanisms e.g., 802.11 exponential backoff scheme with TCP mechanismscongestion control and timeout lead in a multihop environment to new and unexpected phenomena. A survey on TCP research in MANETcan be found in 4. Hereafter, we summarize themain research areas, and the open issues.IMPACT OF MOBILITY. In a MANET, nodesmobility may have a severe impact on the performance of the TCP protocol 2,80,127,128,261.Mobility may cause route failures, and hence,packet losses and increased delays. The TCP misinterprets these losses as congestion, and invokesthe congestion control mechanism, potentiallyleading to unnecessary transmissions duringroutes reconstruction, and throughput degradation 71,127. In addition, the stations mobilitymay exacerbate the unfairness between competitive TCP sessions 261. The performance of theTCP protocol when running among others overDSR and AODV are analyzed in 2,80,127,128.These results point out the route failure frequencyas an important factor in determining TCPthroughput in ad hoc networks.NODES  INTERACTION AT MAC LAYER. Evenwhen stations are static, the performance of an adhoc network may be quite far from ideal, as theperformances are strongly limited by the interaction between neighboring stations. A station activity is limited by the activity of neighboringstations inside the same TXRange, IFRange orPCSRange, and by the interference caused byhidden and exposed stations. For example, in a38 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364chain topology stations early in the chain maycause starvation of later stations. Similar considerations apply to other network topologies. Ingeneral, the 802.11 MAC protocol appears to bemore efficient in case of local traffic patterns, i.e.,when the destination is close to the sender 28.IMPACT OF TCP CONGESTION WINDOW SIZE.TCP congestion window size may have a significant impact on performance. In 101, the authorsshow that, for a given network topology and trafficpatterns, there exists an optimal value of the TCPcongestion window size at which channel utilization is maximized. However, TCP does not operatearound this optimal point, but typically with awindow that is much larger, leading to decreasedthroughput 1030 throughput degradation,and increased packet loss. These losses are due tolinklayer drops a station fails to reach its adjacent station due to the contentioninterference ofother stations. By increasing the congestion window size, the number of packets in the pipe between the sender and the receiver is increased, andhence the contention at the linklevel increases, aswell. Small congestion windows i.e., 13 packetstypically provide the best performance 285,286.INTERACTION BETWEEN MAC PROTOCOLAND TCP. The interaction of the 802.11 MACprotocol with the TCP protocol mechanisms maylead to unexpected phenomena in a multihopenvironment. For example, in the case of simultaneous TCP flows, severe unfairness problemsandin extreme casescapture of the channel byfew flows may occur. Furthermore, instantaneousTCP throughput may be very unstable also with asingle TCP connection. These phenomena can bereducedexacerbated by using smalllarge TCPcongestion window. These problems have beenrevealed in 285,286. Recently, similar phenomenahave been also observed in other scenarios 148.Such phenomena do not appear, or appear withless intensity, when the UDP protocol is used282.Numerous new mechanisms for TCP optimization have also been proposed with the aim ofresolving MANET specific issues, including adaptation of TCP errordetection and recoverystrategies to the ad hoc environment. To minimizethe impact of mobility and link disconnection onTCP performance, 71 proposed to introduce explicit signaling Route Failure and Route Reestablishment notifications from intermediatenodes to notify the sender TCP of the disruptionof the current route, and construction of a newone. In this way, TCP after a link failure does notactivates the congestion avoidance mechanisms,but simply freezes its status that will be resumedwhen a new route is found. In 127,128 an ExplicitLink Failure Notification ELFN mechanism isintroduced. The ELFN objective is to providethrough ELFN messages the TCP at the senderside explicit indications about link and route failures. In this case there is no explicit signalingabout route reconstruction. Ref. 196 presents asimulation study of ELFN mechanism, both instatic and dynamic scenarios. This study pointsout limitations of this approach that are intrinsicto TCP properties e.g., long recovery time after atimeout, and proposes to implement mechanismsbelow the TCP layer. This is also the approachproposed and implemented in 172. In this work,the standard TCP is unmodified, while newmechanisms are implemented in a new thin layer,ad hoc TCP ATCP, between TCP and IP. Thislayer uses ECN messages and ICMP destinationunreachable packets to distinguish congestionconditions from link failures, and from losses onthe wireless links. According to type of event,ATCP takes the appropriate actions. Previoustechniques require explicit notification by intermediate nodes to the sender. To avoid this complexity, 281 proposes to infer at the TCP levelroute changes by observing the outoforder delivery events that are frequently introduced by aroute change.In 101, the authors focus on static multihopnetworks and provide a solution to fix TCP performance problems caused by MACTCP interactions nodes interaction at MAC layer plus TCPcongestion window size. The basic observationhere is that in multihop networks the channelutilization is associated to the spatial channel reuse. Spatial reuse defines, given network topology,nodes that may concurrently transmit without interfering with each other. For a given flow andnetwork topology, there exists a contentionwindow that achieves the best channel reuse, thusI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 39providing the maximum throughput. However,legacy TCP operates with a window larger then theoptimal one, and hence with a reduced throughput. To address this problem, two link levelmechanisms have been proposed 101 Link REDand adaptive spacing. Similarly to the REDmechanism implemented in Internet routers, theLink RED tunes the drop probability at the linklevel by markingdiscarding packet according tothe average number of retries experienced in thetransmission of previous packets. The Link REDthus provides TCP with an early sign of overloadat link level. Adaptive spacing is introduced toimprove spatial channel reuse, thus reducing therisk of stations starvation. The idea here is theintroduction of extra backoff intervals to mitigatethe exposed receiver problems. Adaptive spacing iscomplementary to Link RED it is activated onlywhen the average number of retries experienced inprevious transmission is below a given threshold.6. Applications and middlewareWhile the early MANET applications and deployments have been military oriented, nonmilitary applications have also grown substantiallysince then. Especially in the past few years, withthe rapid advances in mobile ad hoc networkingresearch, mobile ad hoc networks have attractedconsiderable attention and interests from commercial business industry, as well as the standardscommunity. The introduction of new technologiessuch as the Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and Hyperlangreatly facilitates the deployment of ad hoc technology outside of the military domain, and new adhoc networking applications appeared mainly inspecialized fields such as emergency services, disaster recovery and environment monitoring. Inaddition, MANET flexibility makes this technology attractive for several applicative scenarios like,for example, in personal area networking, homenetworking, law enforcement operation, searchandrescue operations, commercial and educational applications, sensor networks 115. Table 2provides a categorization of present and possiblefuture applicative scenarios for MANETs, as wellas the services they may provide in each area.6.1. MiddlewareThe middleware layer operates between thenetworking layers and the distributed applicationsi.e., it mainly implements layers 57 of the OSImodel, with the aim to build on top of raw network services, higher level mechanisms that easythe development and deployment of applications.Mobile ad hoc systems currently developedadopt the approach of not having a middleware,but rather rely on each application to handle allthe services it needs. This constitutes a majorcomplexityinefficiency in the development ofMANET applications.Research on middleware for mobile ad hocnetworks is still in its infancy. Ad hoc networking and selforganization have not yet receivedthe attention they deserve. Existing middlewaremainly focus on mobilenomadic environments,where a fixed infrastructure contains the relevantinformation. For an overview on middleware formobile and pervasive systems, see 9,54,183.Recently, in research circles, some middlewareproposals for mobile ad hoc environments appeared in 116,180,184,195. Their emphasis is onsupporting transient data sharing 195 betweennodes in communication range, data replicationfor disconnected operations 183, or both 116.To achieve this, classical middleware technologieshave been adopted. These include tuple space,mobile agents, and reactive programming throughthe usage of events publishingsubscribing 9,183.While these technologies provide service abstractions that highly simplify the application development, their efficiency in ad hoc environments isstill an open issue. Specifically, among others, solutions must be devised to implement and managein an efficient way agents synchronization, sharedmemory, and to support group communications inan ad hoc network.Among middleware services, Service discoveryand location play a relevant role in ad hoc environments. Upon joining a selforganizing network,mobile nodes should be able to explore the environment to learn and locate the available services.Due to the scarce resources of a MANET theservice discovery, and location should be designedto act in a context aware manner 183.

Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364information, such as nodes current position bothgeographical and logical in terms of network topology, neighborhood, available resources andconstraints must be used to select the most appropriate service providers. A novel notion ofnearness based on communication proximitye.g., to measure the existence a stable communication path between the terminal and the serviceprovider, rather then physical proximity would beuseful to estimate the amount of resources neededto access a service 267.An approach to QoSAware resource discoveryin ad hoc network has been presented in 176. Theproposed approach implements, in an ad hoc environment, the rendezvous discovery approachcommonly used by middleware for mobilenomadic networks, e.g., the Java Intelligent NetworkInfrastructure Jini. Rendezvous servers brokersstore the servicepublish requests coming fromservice providers, and deliver service informationto requesting clients. In an ad hoc network, brokers must be dynamically identified. Specifically, in176 the brokers directory agents election happens through the usage of clusters formationtechniques. To reduce the communication overheads, most of the discovery messages are onlyI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 41exchanged among these directory agents. Hashindexing is applied to distributed agents for reducing the query latency. Specifically, a hashfunction applied to the service attributes returnsthe list of directory agents. QoS guarantees areachieved through a continuous monitoring.7. Cross layers research issuesAs we pointed out in Section 3 see Fig. 2, thereare research areas that may affect all layers of anad hoc system. These include among others energyconservation, security and cooperation, simulationand performance evaluation, and QoS, presentedin this section.7.1. Energy conservationMobile devices rely on batteries for energy.Battery power is finite, and represents one of thegreatest constraints in designing algorithms formobile devices 100,137,175. Projections on progress in battery technology show that only smallimprovements in the battery capacity are expectedin next future 238. Under these conditions, it isvital that power utilization be managed efficientlyby identifying ways to use less power, preferablywith no impact on the applications. Limitation onbattery life, and the additional energy requirements for supporting network operations e.g.,routing inside each node, make the energy conservation one of the main concern in ad hoc networking 53. The importance of this problem hasproduced a great deal of research on energy savingin wireless networks in general 219, and ad hocnetworks in particular 52,58. Strategies for powersaving have been investigated at several levels of amobile device including the physicallayer transmissions, the operating system, and the applications 143. Ref. 70 points out battery propertiesthat impact on the design of battery powered devices.Powersaving policies at the operating systemlevel include strategies for CPU scheduling174,279, and for the harddisk management 122.At the applicationlevel, policies that exploit theapplication semantic or profit of tasks remote execution have been proposed 143. However, insmall mobile devices, networking activities have amajor impact on energy consumption. Experimental results show that power consumption related to networking activities is approximately10 of the overall power consumption of a laptopcomputer, but it raises up to 50 in handhelddevices 149. The impact of network technologieson power consumption has been investigated indepth in 243. The key point in energyawarenetworking is the fact that a wireless interfaceconsumes nearly the same amount of energy in thereceive, transmit, and idle state while in the sleepstate, an interface cannot transmit or receive, andits power consumption is highly reduced. For example, measurements of 802.11 WiFi wirelessinterfaces 61,86,98,225 show that the ratio between power consumption in the transmit and idlestate is less than two the receiving state beingintermediate furthermore, the idlestate powerconsumption is about one order of magnitudegreater than that in the sleep state. Hence, to reduce energy consumption of a network interface, itis necessary to define network protocols thatmaximize the time the interface spends in a powersaving mode e.g., the sleep state by eliminatingreducing the network interface idle times. Thisapproach has been extensively applied in infrastructurebased wireless networks where effectivepolicies have been defined at all layers of theprotocol stack by moving the communication andcomputation efforts on the fixed infrastructure,and maintaining the network interface of the mobile device in the sleep state for most of the time,see e.g., 8 and references herein. This is not aviable approach in an ad hoc network however,where such fixed elements generally do not exist.In addition, selforganization introduces a newmetric for measuring the energy savings the network lifetime. In an infrastructure wireless network, energy management strategies are local toeach node, and are aimed to minimize the nodeenergy consumption. This metric is not viable forad hoc networks where nodes must also cooperateto network operations to guarantee the networkconnectivity. A greedy node that remains most ofthe time in a sleep state, without contributing torouting and forwarding, will maximize its battery42 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364lifetime but compromise the lifetime of the network.We can, therefore, identify at least two classesof powersaving strategies for ad hoc networkslocal strategies, that typically operate on smalltime scales say milliseconds, and global strategiesthat operate on longer time scales.LOCAL STRATEGIES operate inside a node, andtry to put the network interface in a power savingmode with a minimum impact on transmit andreceive operations. These policies typically operateat the physical and MAC layer, with the aim tomaximizing the node battery lifetime without affecting the behavior of the highlevel protocols. Byfocusing on power saving at the transmission level,some authors have proposed and analyzed policiesbased on monitoring the transmission errorrates, which avoid useless transmissions when thechannel noise makes low the probability of a successful transmission 224,297. Similar policieshave been proposed for random accessbasedMAC protocols 24,26. Specifically, at the MAClayer, powersaving strategies are designed toavoid transmitting when the channel is congested,and hence there is a high collision probability.These policies achieve power consumption by reducing the energy required to successfully transmita packet. By applying these policies to the IEEE802.11 MAC protocol, in 26 it has been shownthat optimal tuning of the network interface forachieving the minimal energy consumption almostcoincides with the optimal channel utilization.This behavior is associated with the energy consumption model of WLANs interface in which thereceive, transmit, and idle states are almostequivalent from a power consumption standpoint.In general, power saving in CSMAbased protocols is achieved by using the information derivedfrom the media access control protocol to findintervals during which the network interface doesnot need to be listening. For example, while a nodetransmits a packet, the other nodes within thesame interference and carriersensing range mustremain silent. Therefore, these nodes can sleepwith little or no impact on system behavior. Forexample, PAMAS 231 turns off a nodes radiowhen it is overhearing a packet not addressed to it.Ref. 73 presents a comparison of a number ofMAClayer protocols from the energy efficiencystandpoint. In 69 the authors consider lowcostlargescale devices and present a new approach toenergyefficientMAC protocols based on a pseudorandom protocol, which combines the fairnessfrom random access protocols with the low energyrequirements of classical TDMA.The IEEE 802.11 standard includes a powersaving mechanism effective for onehop ad hocnetworks. This scheme maintains synchronizationamong nodes that therefore can wake up at thesame set of time instants, exchange traffic andother management information, and then return toa sleeping state. Additional details on the 802.11power saving mechanism can be found in 92,while 89,270 analyze its effectiveness. The 802.11approach is suitable for static singlehop networksin which nodes synchronization can be achievedwith a limited effort. This requirement is not feasible in dynamic multihop ad hoc networks.GLOBAL STRATEGIES. The aim of globalstrategies is to maximize the network lifetime.These are based a networkwide approach topower saving, and on the idea that when a regionis dense in terms of nodes, only a small number ofthem need to be turned on in order to forward thetraffic. To achieve this a set of nodes is identifiedwhich must guarantee network connectivity toparticipate in packets routing and forwarding,while remaining nodes can spend most of the timein the sleep state to maximize energy saving.Nodes participating in packet forwarding maynaturally exhaust their energy sooner, thus compromising the network connectivity. Therefore,periodically, the set of active nodes is recomputedby selecting alternative paths in a way that maximizes the overall network lifetime. Identifying thenetworks dominating sets is a typical goal of aglobal strategy. A dominating set is a subset ofnetwork nodes such that each node is in the set, orit has a neighbor in that set. Dominating sets,if connected, constitute the routingforwardingbackbone in the ad hoc network. As the computation of the minimal dominating set is computationally unfeasible, in the literature severaldistributed algorithms exist to approximate suitable dominating sets, see for example 61,81,269,272,283,284. Span 61 is a distributed algorithmI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 43to construct dominating sets using nodes localdecisions to sleep, or to join the routing backbone.Nodes participating in the backbone are namedcoordinators. Coordinators are always in an activestate, while noncoordinator nodes are normally inthe sleep state, and wake up to exchange trafficwith the coordinators. Periodically, the coordinators set is recomputed. The effectiveness of Spandepends on the energy consumption in the idle andsleep state Span benefit increases with the increaseof the idletosleep energyconsumption ratio 61.Span integrates with the 802.11 power savingmode, thus guaranteeing that noncoordinatornodes can receive packets that are buffered by thecoordinators while they are sleeping. Nodesphysical position obtained for example via GPSis used in the GAF algorithm to construct theroutingforwarding backbone. A grid structure issuperposed on the network, and each node is associated with a square in the grid using its physicalposition. Inside the square only one node is inthe nonsleeping state 284. AFECA 283 isan asynchronous distributed algorithm for constructing a routing backbone. Nodes alternatebetween active and sleep states, where in principlea node remains in the sleep state for a time proportional to the number of its neighbors, thusguaranteeing, in average, a constant number ofactive nodes.Controlling the power of the transmitting nodeis the other main direction for achieving powersaving in ad hoc networks. In addition, a reducedtransmission power allows spatial reuse of frequencies, which can help increasing the totalthroughput of network and minimize interference.In wireless systems, the existence or lack of alink between two nodes mainly depends given theacceptable bit error rate on the transmissionpower and the transmission rate. By increasing thetransmission power the number of feasible links isincreased, but at the same time this increases theenergy consumption and the interference 85.Recently, several studies focused on controllingnetwork topology by assigning pernode transmitpowers that guarantee network connectivity, andminimize the transmit power 92,202,222,230,273.The algorithmic aspects of topology controlproblems are discussed in 167.Transmission power is highly correlated withenergy consumption. It determines both theamount of energy drained from the battery foreach transmission, and the number of feasiblelinks. These two effects have an opposite impact onthe energy consumption. By increasing the transmission power we increase the perpacket transmission cost negative effect, but we decrease thenumber of hops to reach the destination positiveeffect because more and longer links becomeavailable. Finding the balance is not a simple undertaking. On one hand, we have to consider thefact that signal strength at a distance r from thesender has nonlinear decay, specifically Sr S  ra a 2 2 4, where S is the amplitude of thetransmitted signal 85. This implies that coveringthe sendertoreceiver distance a multihop pathmay require less energy, from the transmissionstandpoint. On the other hand, on a multihoppath the delay due to the multiple hops, as well asthe processing energy to receive and locally process a packet increase.The tradeoff between minimum transmissionpower and number of hops further complicates thedesign of routing algorithms. A large part of recentwork on energy efficiency in ad hoc networks isconcentrated on routing 227,230,245,255, wherethe transmitting power level is an additional variable in the routing protocol design 91. Thisproblem has been addresses from two differentperspectives i energy is an expensive, but nota limited resource battery can be rechargedreplaced, or ii the energy is finite. The former caseapplies to mobile ad hoc network in general, whilethe latter appears to be a suitable model for sensornetworks. In case i, energy consumption must beminimized typically, this translates in the following target minimize the total energy consumed perpacket to forward it from source to destination. Theminimization of perpacket energy does not maximize network lifetime, as residual energy of thenodes is not taken into consideration. On the otherhand, in case ii, the energy is a hard constraint85, and the maximum lifetime is the target.Minimumenergy routings minimize the energyconsumed to forward a packet from the source tothe destination 103,162,227. Similarly to proactive routing algorithms 162,227 try to find44 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364minimum energy routes for all nodes, while PARO103 behaves as a reactive algorithm by minimizing the energy consumption of ongoing flows. InPARO, nodes intermediate to the sourcedestination pair elect themselves to forward packets, thusreducing the aggregate transmission power consumed by network devices. PARO attempts tomaximize the number of redirector nodes betweensourcedestination pairs, thereby minimizing thetransmission power.Online maximumlifetime routing is a complexproblem 157. In 75, for a static network withknown and constant flows, the maximum lifetimerouting is modeled as a linear programmingproblem. The solution of this model provides theupper bound on the network lifetime that is usedto analyze the effectiveness of the algorithms. Fora single power level, an optimal algorithm is presented while, for the general case, the authorspresent an algorithm that selects routes and adjusts the corresponding power levels achieving aclose to the optimal lifetime.A balance between minimumenergy and maximum lifetime is the target of the CMMBCRstrategy 256. CMMBCR applies a conditionalstrategy that uses the minimum energy route, if thenodes residual energy is greater than a giventhreshold. Otherwise, a route that maximizes theminimum residual energy is selected.7.2. Network security and cooperationWireless mobile ad hoc nature of MANETbrings new security challenge to the network design. Mobile wireless networks are generally morevulnerable to information and physical securitythreats than fixed wired networks. Vulnerability ofchannels and nodes, absence of infrastructure anddynamically changing topology, make ad hocnetworks security a difficult task 35. Broadcastwireless channels allow message eavesdroppingand injection vulnerability of channels. Nodes donot reside in physically protected places, and hencecan easily fall under the attackers control nodevulnerability. The absence of infrastructure makesthe classical security solutions based on certification authorities and online servers inapplicable.Finally, the security of routing protocols in theMANET dynamic environment is an additionalchallenge.The selforganizing environment introducesnew security issues that are not addressed by thebasic security services provided for infrastructurebased networks. Security mechanisms that solelyenforce the correctness or integrity of networkoperations would thus not be sufficient in MANET. A basic requirement for keeping the network operational is to enforce ad hoc nodescontribution to network operations, despite theconflicting tendency motivated by the energyscarcity of each node towards selfishness 114,191.7.2.1. Security attacksSecuring wireless ad hoc networks is a highlychallenging issue. Understanding possible form ofattacks is always the first step towards developinggood security solutions. Ad hoc networks have tocope with the same kinds of vulnerabilities as theirwired counterparts, as well as with new vulnerabilities specific to the ad hoc context 117. Furthermore, traditional vulnerabilities are alsoaccentuated by the ad hoc paradigm.The complexity and diversity of the field different applications have different security constraints led to a multitude of proposals thatcannot be all surveyed in this article. Detailedanalyses of ad hoc networking security issues andsolutions can be found in 35,129,193. Below wesummarize only the main directions of security inad hoc networks.Performing communication in free space exposes ad hoc networks to attacks as anyone canjoin the network, and eavesdrop or inject messages. Ad hoc networks attacks can be classified aspassive or active 155. Passive attack signifies thatthe attacker does not send any message, but justlistens to the channel. A passive attacks does notdisrupt the operation of a protocol, but only attempts to discover valuable information. Duringan active attack, on the other hand, information isinserted into the network.Passive eavesdropping is a passive attack thatattempts to discover nodes information e.g., IPaddresses, location of nodes, etc. by listening torouting traffic. In a wireless environment it isI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 45usually impossible to detect this attack, as it doesnot produce any new traffic in the network.Active attacks involve actions such as the replication, modification and deletion of exchangeddata. Certain active attacks can be easily performed against an ad hoc network. These attackscan be grouped in 145 Impersonation, Denial ofservice, and Disclosure attack.IMPERSONATION. In this type of attack, nodesmay be able to join the network undetectably, orsend false routing information, masquerading assome other trusted node. The Black Hole attack83 falls in this category here a malicious nodeuses the routing protocol to advertise itself ashaving the shortest path to the node whose packetsit wants to intercept. A more subtle type of routingdisruption is the creation of a tunnel or Wormhole in the network between two colluding malicious nodes 126. Ref. 125 provides a detaileddescription of several attacks on routing.DENIAL OF SERVICE. The Routing TableOverflow and the Sleep Depravation attacks 236fall in this category. In the former, the attackerattempts to create routes to nonexistent nodes tooverwhelm the routingprotocol implementations.In the latter, the attacker attempts to consumebatteries of other nodes by requesting routes, or byforwarding unnecessary packets.DISCLOSURE ATTACK. A location disclosureattack can reveal something about the physicallocation of nodes or the structure of the network.Two types of security mechanisms can generally beapplied preventive and detective. Preventivemechanisms are typically based on keybasedcryptography. Keys distribution is therefore at thecenter of these mechanisms. Secret keys are distributed through a preestablished secure channel,and this makes symmetric cryptography generallydifficult to apply in ad hoc networks. Public keysare distributed through certificates that bind apublic key to a device. In the centralized approach,certificates are provided, stored, and distributed bythe Certificate Authority. Since no central authority, no centralized trusted third party, and nocentral server are possible in MANET, the keymanagement function needs to be distributed overnodes. In 294, the key management responsibilityis shared among a set of nodes, called servers. Thechallenge of constructing such a trustworthy aggregation lies not only in how to create and configure the aggregation, but also in how theaggregation maintains its security by adapting tochanges in the network topology. Ref. 49 presents a fully distributed selforganizing public keymanagement system for MANETs. In this approach the users issue certificates for each otherbased on their personal acquaintances. Certificatesare stored in a local certificate repository and distributed by the users themselves. When two userswant to verify the public keys of each other, theymerge their local certificate repositories.In 117, the authors analyze the vulnerabilitiesof keybased security mechanisms, and proposesolutions to protect these mechanisms.The intrusion detection field studies how todiscover that an intruder is attempting to penetratethe network to perform an attack. Most of theintrusion detection techniques developed on afixed wired network are not applicable in this newenvironment. In ad hoc network there are notraffic concentration points switches, routers, etc.where the intrusion detection system IDS cancollect audit data for the entire network. The onlyavailable audit trace will be limited to communication activities taking place within the radiorange, and the intrusion detection algorithm mustrely on this partial and localized information. Aproposal for a new intrusion detection architecturethat is both distributed and cooperative is presented in 295,296. Here all nodes in the wirelessad hoc network participate in intrusion detectionand reaction. Each node is responsible for detecting signs of intrusion locally and independently,but neighbors can collaboratively investigate in abroader range.The IntrusionResistant Ad Hoc Routing Algorithms TIARA 223 is designed against denialof service attacks. The TIARA mechanisms limitthe damage caused by intrusion attacks, and allowfor continued network operations at an acceptablelevel during such attacks.7.2.2. Security at data link layerBluetooth and 802.11 implement mechanismsbased on cryptography to prevent unauthorizedaccesses, and to enhance the privacy on radio46 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364links. An analysis of the various 802.11 andBluetooth mechanisms can be found in 193.Security in the IEEE 802.11 standard is provided by the Wired Equivalent Privacy WEPscheme. WEP supports both data encryption andintegrity. The security is based on a 40bit secretkey. The secret key can either be a default keyshared by all the devices of a WLAN, or a pairwise secret key shared only by two communicatingdevices. Since WEP does not provide any supportfor the exchange of pairwise secret keys, the secretkey must be manually installed on each device. AsWEP suffers from various design flaws and weaknesses 193, to correct the WEP problems a taskgroup part of the IEEE 802.11i standardization isdesigning the new 802.11 security architecture.Bluetooth uses cryptographic security mechanisms implemented in the data link layer. A keymanagement service provides each device with aset of symmetric cryptographic keys required forthe initialization of a secret channel with anotherdevice, the execution of an authentication protocol, and the exchange of encrypted data on thesecret channel. A detailed presentation of Bluetooth security mechanisms, together with ananalysis of the weaknesses in the Bluetooth keymanagement scheme can be found in 193.7.2.3. Secure routingSecure routing protocols cope with maliciousnodes that can disrupt the correct functioning of arouting protocol by modifying routing information, by fabricating false routing information andby impersonating other nodes. Recent studies 216brought up also a new type of attack that goesunder the name of wormhole attack mentionedearlier.We next summarize the recent research that hasbeen done in order to come up with secure routingprotocols for ad hoc networks. More details can befound in 88,193.The Secure Routing Protocol 215 is conceivedas an extension that can be applied to several existing reactive routing protocols. SRP is based onthe assumption of the existence of a security association between the sender and the receiverbased on a shared secret key negotiated at theconnection setup. SRP combats attacks that disrupt the route discovery process. A node initiatinga route discovery is able to identify and discardfalse routing information. Similarly to SRP, Ariadne 125 assumes that each pair of communicating nodes has two secret keys one for eachdirection of the communication. Ariadne is a secure ad hoc routing protocol based on DSR andthe TESLA authentication protocol 210.The Authenticated Routing for Ad hoc Network ARAN protocol is an ondemand, secure,routing protocol that detects and protects againstmalicious actions carried out by third parties in thead hoc environment 240. ARAN is based oncertificates, and assumes that nodes obtain certificates from a trusted certificate server beforejoining the ad hoc network. ARAN utilizes a routediscovery procedure similar to AODV. To securethe communications, route discovery exploits anendtoend authentication stage that guaranteesthat only the destination node can respond to aroute discovery packet.The Secure Efficient Ad hoc Distance SEAD isa proactive secure routing protocol based onDSDV. SEAD deals with attackers that modify arouting table update message. The basic idea is toauthenticate the sequence number and the metricfield of a routing table update message using oneway hash functions 120. Hash chains and digitalsignatures are used by the SAODV mechanism tosecure AODV 290.7.2.4. Cooperation enforcingA basic requirement for keeping an ad hocnetwork operational is to enforce ad hoc nodescontribution to basic network functions such aspacket forwarding and routing. Unlike networksusing dedicated nodes to support basic networkfunctions including packet forwarding, routing,and network management, in ad hoc networksthose functions are carried out by all availablenodes. This difference is at the core of some of thesecurity problems that are specific to ad hoc networks. As opposed to dedicated nodes of a classical network, the nodes of an ad hoc networkcannot be trusted for the correct execution ofcritical network functions. For example, routing isvulnerable in ad hoc networks because each deviceacts as a router. Forwarding mechanism is coopI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 47erative, as well. Communications between nodes,more than 1hop away, are performed by exploiting intermediate relaying nodes. A node that doesnot cooperate is called a misbehaving node.Routingforwarding misbehaviors can be causedby nodes that are malicious or selfish 191. Amalicious node does not cooperate because itwants to intentionally damage network functioning by dropping packets. On the other hand, aselfish node does not intend to directly damageother nodes, but is unwilling to spend battery life,CPU cycles, or available network bandwidth toforward packets not of direct interest to it, eventhough it expects others to forward packets on itsbehalf. Such a node uses the network but does notcooperate. To cope with these problems, a selforganizing network must be based on an incentivefor users to collaborate, thus avoiding selfish behavior. There is a need for mechanisms thatencourageenforce users to behave as good citizens, letting their device relay packets for thebenefit of others, making their data available, andor lending support to the other computations.Most of the solutions, currently available inliterature, present a similar approach to the cooperation problem 16,189,192. They aim at detecting and isolating misbehaving nodes through amechanism based on a watchdog and a reputationsystem. The watchdog identifies misbehavingnodes by performing neighborhood monitoring.This is done by promiscuously listening to thewireless link. According to collected information,the reputation system maintains a value for eachobserved node that represents the nodes reputation. The reputation mechanism allows nodes ofthe network to isolate misbehaving nodes by notserving their requests. Existing solutions presentadvantages and disadvantages. The solution presented in 189 constitutes the starting point forresearch in this area. It extends the DynamicSource Routing with a watchdog concept forthe detection of nonforwarding nodes, and apathrater for the avoidance of such nodes inroutes. Every node in the network keeps ratingsabout every other node. The pathrater uses ratings to choose the network path that is most likelyto deliver packets. The main drawback of suchan approach is that it does not punish selfishnodes that therefore have no incentive to cooperate.The CONFIDANT protocol 16 is an extension to the DSR intended to deal with the routingmisbehavior problem. The objective is to makemisbehavior unattractive by finding and isolatingmalicious nodes. Each node monitors the behaviorof its onehop neighbors. If a suspicious event isdetected, this information is submitted to a reputation system, which maintains a list of ratingsreflecting nodes behavior. If the ratings becomeintolerable, the information is given to a pathmanager which can deletes all routes containingthe misbehaving node from the path cache. It canalso decide to not serving routingforwarding requests from a selfish host. A trust manager sendsan alarm message to alert others of maliciousnodes.The CORE mechanism 192 copes with selfishness by stimulating node cooperation nodesthat want to use network resources have to contribute to routing and forwarding, thus balancingutilization and contribution to the network. Everynode in the network monitors the behavior of itsneighbors with respect to a requested functionpacket forwarding, route discovery, etc., andcollects observations about the execution of thatfunction. Based on the collected observations,each node computes a reputation value for eachneighbor. When a neighbors reputation falls below a predefined threshold, service provision to themisbehaving node is suspended. In this way, thereis no advantage to nodes misbehavior, as resourceutilization will be suspended. Both CONFIDANTand CORE allow a type of resocialization andreintegration of no longer or wrongly accusedmisbehaving nodes.Some open issues can be identified in CONFIDANT and CORE approaches to cooperation.Firstly, the watchdogs weaknesses are not negligible in presence of collisions, differences in thetransmission ranges, or directional antennas,the watchdog is not able to properly monitoringthe neighbors, and misbehaving nodes detectioncan fail. As these characteristics are quite frequentin ad hoc networks, watchdog observations canbecome meaningless. Another important aspectto consider is the employing of cooperation in48 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364security mechanisms. In the case of the CONFIDANT protocol, malicious nodes may initiate anew attack by sending false alarms about othernodes. The impact of wrong accusation spreadingon the CONFIDANT reputation system is discussed in 17. In the CORE mechanism no negative ratings are spread between nodes, but amalicious node can deceive the reputation systemby sending forged Route Reply. Finally, bothCONFIDANT and CORE do not take into account network utilization by totally avoiding allroutes containing misbehaving nodes, they create arisk of diverting all the traffic to well behavingnodes, with the result of overloading these andlinks between them. Optimizing network utilization, while avoiding misbehaving nodes is thetarget of the work presented in 59. This paperpresents a framework that confronts, in additionto malicious and selfish nodes, misbehavior causedby uncontrollable events. By exploiting reliabilityindices, certain packet forwarding policies are defined and contrasted to increase the network performance i.e., optimize network utilization, andreliability i.e., avoiding misbehaving nodes.An original approach to cooperation is proposed in 36. In this work an economic model isused to enforce cooperation. The solution presented in this paper consists of the introduction ofa virtual currency, nuglet used in every networkoperation that requires nodes cooperation. Specifically, it is assumed that every node has a tamperresistant security module, which maintains a nuglet counter. This counter is decremented down tozero when the node wants to send one of its ownpackets i.e., the node has to pay for its owntransmissions. On the other hand, the nugletcounter is increased i.e., the node gets a rewardwhen the node forwards a packet for the benefit ofother nodes.A survey of cooperation mechanism is presented in 114 where the relationship betweencooperation in ad hoc networks and people socialbehavior is presented. From this perspective,Game theory is a natural way for modeling andanalyzing cooperation aspects in ad hoc networks.Game rules model the freedom of every node tochoose cooperation or isolation. The use of gametheory to model the cooperation in ad hoc networkis presented in 194,266. In the model presented in266 nodes are players, communications aremoves, and the repetition of the basic gamethroughout time models subsequent communications mobility is taken into account by means of adiscount factor that makes future uncertain inevery moment. Authors show that cooperationcan be fully enforced with local observation ifmobility is low. Furthermore, they show that anode will forward at most the same amount oftraffic it generates. In 194 both a cooperativegame approach and a noncooperative game approach, are applied to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe CORE mechanism.7.3. Simulation and performance evaluationThere are two main approaches in system performance evaluation the first uses measurementsthe second is based on a representation of thesystem behavior via a model 150,156. Measurement techniques are applied to real systems, andthus they can be applied only when a real system,or a prototype of it, is available. Currently, onlyfew measurements studies on real ad hoc testbedscan be found in the literature, see e.g., 11,41. TheUppsala University APE testbed 11 is one of thelargest, having run tests with more than thirtynodes. The results from this testbed are very important as they are pointing out problems thatwere not detected by preceding simulation studies.An important problem, related to the differenttransmission ranges for 802.11b control and dataframes, is the socalled communication gray zonesproblem 170. This problem was revealed by agroup of researchers at the Uppsala University,while measuring the performance of their ownimplementation of the AODV routing protocol inan IEEE 802.11b ad hoc network. Observing anunexpected large amount of packets losses, mainlyduring route changes, it was found that increase inpacket loss occurred in some specific geographicareas termed called communication gray zones.In such zones, the packet loss experienced by astation may be extremely high, up to 100, thusseverely affecting the performance of applicationsassociated with a continuous packet flow e.g., filetransfers and multimedia streaming. It was alsoI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 49found that the reason for this phenomenon is thata station inside a gray zone is considered using therouting information reachable by a neighboringstation, while actual data communication betweenthe stations is not possible. The same problem wasfound to affect other routing protocols, such asOLSR. It is important to point out that communication gray zone problem cannot be revealedby commonly used simulation tools e.g., NS2,Glomosim, as in these 802.11 models both unicastand broadcast transmissions are performed at 2Mbps, and hence have the same transmissionrange.Constructing a real ad hoc network testbed fora given scenario is typically expensive and remainslimited in terms of working scenarios, mobilitymodels, etc. Furthermore, measurements are generally nonrepeatable. For these reasons, protocolsscalability, sensitiveness to users mobility patternsand speeds are difficult to investigate on a realtestbed. Using a simulation or analytic model, onthe other hand, permits the study of system behavior by varying all its parameters, and considering a large spectrum of network scenarios.Evaluating system performance via a modelconsists of two steps i defining the system model,and ii solving the model using analytical andorsimulative techniques. Analytical methods areoften not detailed enough for the ad hoc networksevaluation and in terms of accounting for mobility, in their infancy. On the other hand, simulationmodeling is a more standardized, mature, andflexible tool for modeling various protocols andnetwork scenarios, and allows by running thesimulation model collection and analyses thatfully characterize the protocol performance inmost cases.A very large number of simulation models havebeen developed to study ad hoc network architectures and protocols under many network scenarios number of nodes, mobility rates, etc..Simulation studies have been extensively appliedfor instance to compare and contrast large number of routing protocols developed for MANETs,see e.g., 42,82,84,140. Ref. 99 presents a theoretical framework to compare ad hocnetworkrouting protocols in an implementation independent manner by measuring each protocols performance relative to a theoreticaloptimum.The use of simulation techniques in the performance evaluation of communication networksis a consolidated research area see 55 and thereferences herein, however MANET simulationhas several open research issues. An in depth discussion of methods and techniques for MANETssimulation can be found in 19. In the following,we discuss two current topics i models of nodesmobility and ii network simulators.7.3.1. Mobility modelsThe ability of ad hoc networks protocols tocorrectly behave in a dynamic environment, wheredevices position may continuously change, is a keyissue. Therefore, modeling users movements is animportant aspect in ad hoc network simulation.This includes among others 19 the definition of the simulated area in whichusers movements take place, and the rules formodeling users that moves beyond the simulated area the number of nodes in the simulated area, andthe allocation of nodes at the simulation startup and the mobility model, itself.Typically, simulation studies assume a numberof users that moves inside a closed rectangulararea. Closed here stands for a constant number ofusers inside the simulated area. Rules are definedfor users arriving at the edges of the area. Forexample, in 127 the network model consists of 30nodes in a 1500 m  300 m closed rectangular area.The random waypoint mobility model is themodel most commonly used to define the wayusers move in the simulated area. According tothis model, nodes move according to a broken linepattern, standing at each vertex for a modeldefined pause time p. Specifically, each nodepicks a random destination in the rectangular area,sample a speed value according to a uniform distribution in the range 0 vmax, and then travels tothe destination along a straight line. Once the nodearrives at its destination, it pauses for a time p,then chooses draws another destination and50 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364continues onward. The pause time and the maximum speed, v, are mobility parameters. By changing these values various system mobility patternsare captured. For example, p  0 signifies that allnodes are always in motion throughout the simulation run.Recent studies have pointed out problems in therandom waypoint model. Two specific types ofproblems have been identified i the nodes average speed is decreasing, and ii the nodes distribution in the simulated area is nonuniform.AVERAGE SPEED. The random waypointmodel is expected to guarantee an average speedof vmax2 throughout the simulation run. On theother hand, results presented in 288 show thatthe average node speed decreases over time whilethe simulation progress, more and more nodes areinvolved in traveling long distance at low speeds.This behavior of the random waypoint modelgenerates invalid results. The simulation experiments never enter a steady state, and the timeaveraged statistics drastically change over time. Asimple solution based on avoiding speeds close tozero is suggested in 288 to overcome this problem. By sampling the speed in the range1 vmax  1, after a transient period, the simulation enters a steady state in which the averagespeed is, as expected, equal to vmax2.NODES  DISTRIBUTION. Nodes moving according to the random waypoint model tend toconcentrate in the middle of the simulated area,creating the socalled border effect 14,15,37. Thisyields node spatial distribution that is not uniform.In 45, it is shown that for large values of thepause time the border effect is limited, and thespatial distribution can well approximate uniformdistribution. However, for other mobility parameters, the border effect may become highly pronounced, and the assumption of the uniformdistribution of the nodes in the simulated area isno longer valid.7.3.2. Network simulatorsMost MANET simulative studies are based onsimulation tools. The main advantage of thesetools is that they provide libraries containing predefined models for most communication protocolse.g., 802.11, Ethernet, TCP, etc.. In addition,these tools often provide graphical interfaces thatcan be used both during the model developmentphase, and during simulation runs to simplifyfollowing dynamic protocol and network behaviors.Popular network simulators used in ad hocnetworks include OPNET 204, NS2 200,Glomosim 109 and its commercial version QualNet 220. They all provide advanced simulationenvironments to test and debug different networking protocols, including collision detection modules, radio propagation and MAC protocols. Somerecent results question however the validity ofsimulations based on these tools. Specifically, 74presents the simulative results of the floodingalgorithm using OPNET, NS2 and Glomosim.Important divergences between the simulators results have been measured. The observed differencesare not only quantitative not the same absolutevalue, but also qualitative not the same generalbehavior making some past observation of MANET simulation studies an open issue.7.4. Quality of serviceProviding Quality of Service QoS, other thanbest effort, is a very complex problem in MANETs, and makes this area a challenging area offuture MANET research 181. Networks abilityto provide QoS depends on the intrinsic characteristics of all the network components, fromtransmission links to the MAC and network layers232. MANET characteristics generally lead to theconclusion that this type of network provides aweak support to QoS. Wireless links have a relatively low and highly variable capacity, and highloss rates. Topologies are highly dynamic withfrequent links breakages. Random accessbasedMAC protocols, which are commonly used in thisenvironment e.g., 802.11b, have no QoS support.Finally, MANET link layers typically run in unlicensed spectrum, making it more difficult toprovide strong QoS guarantees in spectrum hardto control 181. This scenario indicates that, notonly hard QoS guarantees will be difficult toachieve in a MANET, but if the nodes are highlymobile even statistical QoS guarantees may beimpossible to attain, due to the lack of sufficientlyI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 51accurate knowledge both instantaneous and predictive of the network states 38. Furthermore,since the quality of the network in terms ofavailable resources reside in the wireless mediumand in the mobile nodes e.g., buffer and batterystate varies with time, present QoS models forwired networks are insufficient in a selforganizingnetwork, and new MANET QoS model must bedefined 118. Specifically, DiffServ and IntServi.e., the Internet QoS models require accuratelink state e.g., available bandwidth, packet lossrate delay, etc. and topology information. In118,287, an attempt is made to define a MANETQoS model that benefits from the concepts andfeatures of the existing models. The Flexible QoSModel for MANET FQMM is based both onIntServ and Diffserv. Specifically, for applicationswith high priority, perflow QoS guarantees ofIntServ are provided. On the other hand, applications with lower priorities achieve DiffServ perclass differentiation. As FQMM separately appliesboth IntServ and DiffServ for different priorities,the drawbacks related to IntServ and DiffServ stillremain. A more realistic direction for QoS provisioning in ad hoc network is based on an adaptiveQoS model applications must adapt to the timevarying resources offered by the network. In 201,the QoS model for a MANET is defined as providing a set of parameters in order to adapt theapplication to the quality of the network.The quality of service provided by the networkis not related to any dedicated network layer rather it requires coordinated efforts from all layers.Important QoS components include QoS MAC,QoS routing, and resourcereservation signaling214,271.QoS MAC protocols solve the problems ofmedium contention, support reliable unicastcommunications, and provide resource reservationfor realtime traffic in a distributed wireless environment 271. Among numerous MAC protocolsand improvements that have been proposed, protocols that can provide QoS guarantees to realtime traffic in a distributed wireless environmentinclude GAMAPR protocol 188 and BlackBurst BB contention mechanism 244.QoS routing refers to the discovery and maintenance of routes that can satisfy QoS objectivesunder given resource constraints, while QoS signaling is responsible for actual admission control,scheduling, as well as resource reservation alongthe route determined by QoS routing, or otherrouting protocols. Both QoS routing and QoSsignaling coordinate with the QoS MAC protocolto deliver the required QoS.Much research has been done in each of thesecomponent areas 64,168,214,271. INSIGNIA isthe first QoS signaling protocol specifically designed for resource reservation in ad hoc environments 7,159. It supports inband signaling byadding a new option field in IP header called INSIGNIA to carry the signaling control information. Like RSVP, the service granularity supportedby INSIGNIA is perflow management. The INSIGNIA module is responsible for establishing,restoring, adapting, and tearing down realtimeflows. It includes fast flow reservation, restorationand adaptation algorithms that are specificallydesigned to deliver adaptive realtime service inMANETs 159. If the required resource is unavailable, the flow will be degraded to besteffortservice. QoS reports are sent to source node periodically to report network topology changes, aswell as QoS statistics loss rate, delay, andthroughput. DRSVP 197 is another QoS signaling protocols for MANET based on RSVP.QoS routing helps establishing the route forsuccessful resource reservation by QoS signaling66,271. This is a difficult task. In order to makeoptimal routing decision, QoS routing requiresconstant updates on link state information such asdelay, bandwidth, cost, loss rate, and error rate tomake policy decision, resulting in large amount ofcontrol overhead, which can be prohibitive forbandwidth constrained ad hoc environments. Inaddition, the dynamic nature of MANETs makesmaintaining the precise link state information extremely difficult, if not impossible 38,239,271.Finally, even after resource reservation, QoS stillcannot be guaranteed due to the frequent disconnections and topology changes. Several QoSrouting algorithms were published recently with avariety of QoS requirements and resource constraints 66,214, for example, CEDAR 249,ticketbased probing 68, Predictive LocationBased QoS Routing 250, Localized QoS routing52 I. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364289, and QoS routing based on bandwidth calculation 166.8. Discussion and conclusionsIn coming years, mobile computing will keepflourishing, and an eventual seamless integrationof MANET with other wireless networks, and thefixed Internet infrastructure, appears inevitable.Ad hoc networking is at the center of the evolutiontowards the 4th generation wireless technology. Itsintrinsic flexibility, ease of maintenance, lack ofrequired infrastructure, autoconfiguration, selfadministration capabilities, and significant costsadvantages make it a prime candidate for becoming the stalwart technology for personal pervasivecommunication. The opportunity and importanceof ad hoc networks is being increasingly recognized by both the research and industry community, as evidenced by the flood of researchactivities, as well as the almost exponential growthin the Wireless LANs and Bluetooth sectors.In moving forward towards fulfilling this opportunity, the successful addressing of open technical and economical issues will play a critical rolein achieving the eventual success and potential ofMANET technology. From the technical standpoint, as shown in this article, despite the largevolume of research activities and rapid progressmade in the MANET technologies in the past fewyears, almost all research areas from enablingtechnologies to applications still harbor manyopen issues. This is characteristically exemplifiedby research activities performed on routing protocols. Most work on routing protocols is beingperformed in the framework of the IETF MANETworking group, where four routing protocols arecurrently under active development. These includetwo reactive routing protocols, AODV and DSR,and two proactive routing protocols, OLSR andTBRPF. There has been good progress in studyingthe protocols behavior almost exclusively bysimulation, as can be seen in the large conferenceliterature in this area, but the absence of performance data in nontrivial network configurationscontinues to be a major problem. The perception isthat of a large number of competing routing protocols, a lack of WGwide consensus, and fewsigns of convergence 178. To overcome this situation, a discussion is currently ongoing to focalize the activities of the MANET WG towards thedesign of IETF MANET standard protocols,and to split off related longterm research workfrom IETF. The longterm research work maypotentially move to the IETFs sister organization,the IRTF Internet Research Task Force that hasrecently established a group on Ad hoc NetworkScaling Research.MANET WG proposes a view of mobile ad hocnetworks as an evolution of the Internet. Thismainly implies an IPcentric view of the network,and the use of a layered architecture. Current research points out though that this choice may limitdeveloping efficient solutions for MANET. Otherpromising directions have been identified 115.The use of the IP protocol has two main advantages it simplifies MANET interconnection to theInternet, and guarantees the independence fromwireless technologies. On the other hand, moreefficient and lightweight solutions can be obtained,for example, by implementing routing solutions atlower layers 10,259. Furthermore, masking lowerlayers characteristics may not to be useful inMANET. The layered paradigm has highly simplified Internet design, however when applied toad hoc networks, it may result in poor performance as it prevents exploiting important interlayer dependencies in designing efficient ad hocnetwork functions. For example, from the energymanagement standpoint, power control and multiple antennas at the link layer are coupled withpower control and scheduling at MAC layer, andwith energyconstrained and delayconstrainedrouting at network layer 115. Relaxing the Internet layered architecture, by removing the strictlayer boundaries, is an open issue in the MANETevolution. Crosslayer design of MANET architecture and protocols is a promising direction formeeting the emerging application requirements,particularly when energy is a limited resource.From the economic standpoint, the mainquestion to be addressed in the MANET model isthe identification of business scenarios that canmove MANETs success beyond the academy andresearch labs. Currently, apart from specializedI. Chlamtac et al.  Ad Hoc Networks 1 2003 1364 53areas battlefield, disaster recovery, etc., the mainbusiness opportunity appears to be in tools see,e.g., MeshNetworks 5 and SPANworks 6, whichlet PDAs andor laptops, set up selforganizingnetworks. However, no clear understanding of aMANET killer applications has yet emerged.Legacy, contentorientated services and applications enhanced by the selforganizing paradigmcould become such an application, as similar toSMS, it would allow to exploit the mobility provided by cellular systems. Users benefits gainedwith the use of the ad hoc technology could makethe difference compared to legacy applicationsshared whiteboard, chat, filesharing. Part ofbringing the MANET technology to the users isthe development of large testbeds with direct usersinvolvement, as in 190.In addition to the development of applicationsand system solutions tailored to the ad hoc paradigm, MANET may offer business opportunitiesfor network service provider, and potentially openthe wireless arena to new operators. The lack ofinfrastructure in MANET is appealing to newcommercial systems since it circumvents the needfor a large investment to get the network up andrunning, and the development costs may be scaleswith network success 115. Minimum investments,coupled with the emerging tendency mainly inUSA to deregulate the spectrum environment tocreate a secondary market, eliminatereduce thebarriers to new operators entering the market tooffer new wireless services. However, the MANETpotentialities cannot become a reality without aneconomic model that identifies potential revenuesbehind MANETbased network services. For example, network services based on the MANETparadigm could be used to efficiently extend thecapacitycoverage of WiFi hot spots. It is expected that the bandwidth request in hot spots willincrease rapidly, thus requiring higher speed accesstechnologies. With the current 802.11 technology,higher speeds imply a reduction in the coveragearea of the Access Point AP. Spreading in a hotspot a large number of APs to guarantee the5 httpwww.meshnetworks.com6 httpwww.spanworks.comcoverage is not appealing both from the economicinfrastructure cost and technical standpoint APsinterference. The ad hoc paradigm can possiblyoffer an efficient solution to this problem the APsupgraded with multirate highspeed technologiese.g., 802.11a achieve the required coverage byexploiting a multihop wireless network. Whilefrom a technology standpoint, feasible solutionscan be designed to apply the MANET technologyto extend APs coverage the critical point remainsthe economic model. Which model could be applied for example in such a scenario to have userscooperating to provide support to the networkservice provisioning remains a question that typifies the open issues on the way of transitioningMANET results into the business environment.AcknowledgementsThe work of Marco Conti was partially fundedby the Information Society Technologies programme of the European Commission, Future andEmerging Technologies under the IST200138113MobileMAN project.References1 J.
