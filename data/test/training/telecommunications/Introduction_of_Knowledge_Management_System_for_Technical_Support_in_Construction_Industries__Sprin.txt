Get Access Abstract The “Knowledge Management System” has been introduced for the necessity of convenient communication and productivity improvement; the existing legacy systems have limitations such as the low effectiveness in information sharing and such functions. This study developed an enhanced construction information management system which improved the functions of storing, searching, and sharing of the information. The proposed “Knowledge Document Management (KDM) Portal” can perform Knowledge management through various access methods. Personal files can be managed with a file viewer and advanced viewer functions. The system also enables a ‘quick search’ using a highlighting system within the text-file search.
