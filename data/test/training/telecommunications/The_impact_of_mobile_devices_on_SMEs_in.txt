Abstract
Business is selling goods and services to customers (Thefreedictionary, 2008).
Wholesale Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are doing business and having the
latest information is very important for their business. The ones that have the latest
information will get the latest products and will increase their market share. Mobile
devices provide data transfer ability and allow immediate access anywhere and
anytime. Mobile devices are becoming important for communication in their business.
This research investigated the impact of mobile devices on SMEs in Auckland,
New Zealand (NZ). Data was gathered by interview. Fifteen SMEs were invited to
interview. Thirteen participants in eight SMEs agreed to be interviewees. The findings
of the interviews pointed out that most SMEs were using mobile devices for
communication and most SMEs were using Bluetooth for data transfer. This study
may help SMEs to appreciate the role of mobile devices as important communication
tools in their business. The study findings may be useful for manufacturers and
application developers to target mobile devices especially for SMEs market.

1. Introduction
The number of mobile device is about 5 to 10 times the number of personal computers
(PCs) in the market (Bracey & Culver, 2005). Mobile devices are growing faster than
PCs along with growth in information technology. Mobile devices such as cell phones
are easily available to every one and this has led to their growth. The focus of this
dissertation is to research the impact of mobile devices in Wholesale trade Small and
Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in Auckland, New Zealand (NZ).

Mobile devices have gained popularity in the present world (Geser, 2004). Non IT
professionals such as students, farmers and doctors use mobile devices (Brewer et al.,
2005). Mobile devices can be used for long distance communication (Kristoffersen &
Ljungberg, 1999). First generation cell phones allowed people to talk and listen to
each other anywhere and anytime without the wire (Rafael, 2003). The third
generation (3G) phones allow people to see each other anywhere and anytime in
addition to exchange of speech (audio) (BBC, 2004).

Previously wholesale trading SMEs manually recorded information for their
business(Chau & Turner, 2001). Wholesale trade SMEs spent lots of time and human
resource in this. In spite of manual work, they made mistakes. Lately they have started
using computers instead of manual work. Internet has also been adopted as a part of
this change. With greater use of in mobile devices, SMEs are able to work differently
from how they used to do earlier.

2. Literature Review
This section will begin with defining mobile devices and then go on to review the
literature related to different mobile device technologies. This section will also cover
mobile device in SMEs around the world. The discussion on mobile devices with
special emphasis being used by SMEs in NZ will follow thereafter.


2.1 Mobile Devices Definition
A mobile device is a handheld pocket sized computing device with a small screen for
out put and a mini keyboard or touch screen as an input device, such as a cell phone,
smart phone, PDA or any other portable computing device (Paelke, Reimann, &
Rosenbach, 2003; Sarker & Wells, 2003).

Hand held mobile devices that will be chosen for this research are those that affect
SMEs. These could cover cell phones, PDAs and the like. These devices are expected
to influence SMEs’ business performance. Mobile devices used exclusively for
entertainment are not included in this study, such as Play Station Portable (PSP) and
MP3 players. Those devices are developed for entertainment only not for business.
Some old mobile devices are not chosen either such as calculator and cordless phones.

In view of many / diverse mobile devices, this sub section undertakes to define the
scope of mobile devices for the purpose of this dissertation. Devices that are included
for this study will cover:
• Cell phones
• Smart phones, such as Sony Ericsson Smartphone, BlackBerry, IPhone
• PDAs
Mobile devices that are excluded are:
• Handheld Music Players, such as Mp3, CD-Player
• Handheld game consoles, such as PSP, gameboy
• Handheld televisions

• Calculators
• Cordless phones (extension of common landline phones).
• Other IP phones
• Table PC


2.1.1 Cell Phone Definition
A cell phone is an electronic telecommunication mobile device that uses radio waves
or satellite transmission to communicate over a wireless analog or digital network.
Cell phones can commonly be named mobile phones or cellular phones. A cell phone
supports voice communication, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message
Service (MMS), Web browsing and email (Jupitermedia, 2007;
PhoneServiceReviews.com, 2007).


2.1.2 PDAs Definition
A Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) is a small size mobile device that fits in the hand
and has a touch screen and a small keyboard. PDAs support voice communication, fax
capability and email service via a wireless network connection. PDAs support
software applications such as Internet Explorer (IE) and Calendar. PDAs have evolved
and incorporate cell phone and 3G functions (Bytown, 2007; CITES, 2007).

Most current PDAs incorporate cell phone features such as the PDA phone which was
released during the 2.5 G mobile phone. Some new PDAs are built with 3G features
as well. They can connect to Internet with faster speed via 3G and IEEE802.11 / 16 /
20 Wireless Network standards (Chu & Ganz, 2005).

Some PDAs have two inputs which are mini keyboard and touch screen. For example,
I-mate’s JasJam is a PDA with 3G features. The device includes 400MHz Central
Processing Unit (CPU), 128MB of onboard Read Only Memory (ROM) and 64MB of

Random Access Memory (RAM), 2-megapixel camera, 2.8-inch 320*320 pixel
display, keyboard, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, quad-band Global System for Mobile
communications (GSM), 3G - Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS), Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) and High-Speed
Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) (Vodafone.co.nz, 2007a).


2.1.3 Smart Phone Definition
A smart phone is a hand held mobile device which combines cell phone and PDA
functions. Smart phones include backlit colour screen, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, large RAM,
large ROM and use advanced operating systems which can support running advance
applications. It is also possible to insert memory sticks (Hair, 2006; Holzinger,
Nischelwitzer, & Meisenberger, 2005; Zheng & Ni, 2006). The other subsections that
follow cover different mobile data technologies below.


2.1.4 Mobile Data Technologies
Mobile data can be divided into 3G, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), Wireless
Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax),
Bluetooth, and Infrared Data Association (IrDA).

3G mobile data is based on packet data. 3G cell phone connecting speed can be up to
2Mbps. This feature can be used for developing new applications. IE browser can
browse Internet as fast as PCs’ IE browser and is able to accommodate high speed
broadband. Windows Media Player can play live TV by high speed Internet
connection. 2G cell phones using GPRS speed is about 54 Kbps. The 2.5G cell phone
connecting speed can be about 114kbps (Halonen & Melero, 2003; M-indya.com,
2007). In New Zealand, Vodafone provides 3G mobile broadband with a maximum
speed of 3.5 Mbps and average speed between 800 Kbps and 1.4 Mbps
(Vodafone.co.nz, 2007b). NZ Telecom provides mobile broadband average download
speed of 800 Kbps and upload speed of 300 Kbps (Telecom.co.nz, 2007).


GPRS is the packet-switched extension of Global System for Mobile Communications
(GSM). “GPRS was developed for IP-based services compared to existing
circuit-switched services provided by GSM” mobile data which is for (GSM) cell
phone users. It only can provide 54Kbps. It provides data transfer for MMS, email and
Internet browsing (Kalden, Meirick, & Meyer, 2002).

Wi-Fi is wireless technology for local area network. It uses IEEE 802.11 Standards.
Wi-Fi supports wireless network for PCs, laptops, PDAs, Cell phones with built-in
wireless features. PDAs and Cell phones only use the IEEE 802.11b standard for the
wireless network. It can only support 11Mbps for network connection. Some homes
and offices have Wi-Fi wireless networks that can provide networks for PDAs and cell
phones. If PDAs and cell phones are beyond the ranges of the wireless hubs / Access
Points (APs), they will not be able to connect to the Internet (Wi-Fi Alliance, 2007a).

WiMax is short for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access. It can provide
high speed Internet connection for a large number of users over a large area (Ghosh,
Wolter, Andrews, & Chen, 2005). It can provide about 31 miles range for full mobile
cellular type access from point-to-point. A popular WiMax standard is IEEE 802.16.
WiMax is used for mobile as well as point-to-multipoint wireless communication
(Vaughan-Nichols, 2004). The footprint and ranges of WiMax are longer than Wi-Fi.
For distances around 10 km, speeds of up to 10Mbps can be achieved (Wi-Fi Alliance,
2007b). If there are too many users connected to WiMax at the same time, the range
will be limited and speed lowered. WiMax provides broadband communication for
mobile devices. It enables mobile devices to be connected to the Local Area Network
(LAN) and even Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs). It will also result in lower
costs Internet connection as compared to 3G or GPRS (Wi-Fi Alliance, 2007b).

Bluetooth is a wireless standard for interconnecting devices to a small (personal)
network for mobile devices. It only provides short ranges. The data frequency used is
2.4 GHz and it enables ranges of up to 30 feet (Bluetooth.com, 2008; Wi-Fi Alliance,
2007b). Bluetooth provides data transfer speed around 1Mbps (Haartsen, Allen, &
Inouye, 1998).


IrDA uses the Infrared frequency spectrum to transfer data between different devices.
In 1993, international standards for IrDA software and hardware have been made for
infrared communication links. IrDA provides a wireless data communication for
different mobile devices, laptops, digital cameras and other devices (Kane, 2007).


2.1.5 3G Evolution
The first generation of cell phone has features of voice communication only. The
features of second generation (2G) cell phones are basic first generation features plus
short message service (SMS).  The features of 2.5 generation cell phones are 2G
features plus multimedia message service (MMS) and basic low speed browsing
service. Some 2.5G cell phones also have digital camera functionality as well. Third
generation cellular technology is based on 2.5G technology plus video calling and
high speed broadband connection features. 1G, 2G and 2.5G are using GSM and
CDMA. 3G network have several standards. These are: W-CDMA, CDMA2000 and
TD-SCDMA. W-CDMA is short for Wideband Code Division Multiple Access.
CDMA2000 is short for code division multiple access. TD-SCDMA is short for Time
Division-Synchronous CDMA (21cn.com, 2002). 3G technology provides high speed
for the video communication. This “satisfies the stringent requirements of real-time,
low-delay interactive conversational video services” (Basso, 2006).  Main features
of 3G technology cover packet switching technology, extensive Internet coverage,
high Internet connection speed, new and better applications and service access.


Packet Switching technology
The information (data) is separated into different packets before transfer. Before the
information is received, the packets will be reassembled. The packets “are all related
and fit together, but the way they are transported and assembled varies. Packet
switched data formats are much more common than their circuit switched
counterparts” (M-indya.com, 2007). Package switching standards includes X.25,
Frame Relay and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).

Extensive Internet coverage:

Cell phones can be connected to the Internet anytime extensively. The Internet
provides the means for people to contact friends or customers. Land line (fixed line)
limits Internet access ability. Even where wireless laptops are used the access ability
is limited to the availability of Wi-Fi / WiMax access and availability of lab top device.
Cell phones can connect to the Internet in any place which has cellular signal
coverage.

Higher Internet connection speed:
3G Cell phone connecting speed can be up to 2Mbps. This feature can be used for
developing new applications. IE browser can browse Internet very fast as PCs’ IE
browser, is capable to accommodate high speed broadband. Windows Media Player
can play live TV by high speed Internet connection. 2G cell phones using GPRS
speed is about 54 Kbps. The 2.5G cell phone connecting speed can be about 114kbps.

New applications
Because of high speed 3G possibilities, new applications are available, that can
connect to internet at any time and also can be updated any time. They can also be
used to control remote servers as terminals over Internet.

Service access
The specific components system needed for using 3G technology mentioned by
M-indya in 2007 is covered below:
A 3G mobile device or terminal
3G telephone network such as WCDMA (including UMTS (3GSM) and
FOMA), UMTS-TDD (including TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA), HSPA
(including HSDPA and HSUPA), HSPA+, GAN (UMA) and Mobile WiMax
(WiBro)
Understanding of the 3G mobile devices functions and knowledge of how to
use software and hardware in 3G mobile devices
Smart phone and PDA phone can access both WML and HTML pages and
applications can get data from internet immediately and direct.
“Use of Third Generation (3G) must be enabled for that user. Automatic
access to the 3G may be allowed by some mobile network operators, others
will charge a monthly subscription and require a specific opt-in to use the

service as they do with other nonvoice mobile services ” (M-indya.com,
2007).


2.2 Classification of SMEs
In this section, SMEs will be classified with regard to worldwide and NZ. Definition
of SMEs worldwide will be based on the discussion and definition of SMEs in
different countries. In NZ, SMEs will be discussed based on their classification by
Ministry of Economic Development (MED).


2.2.1 Defining SMEs Worldwide
SMEs have different definitions. These definitions can be based on capital investment,
the number of employees, economic, cultural and social dimensions (Ahmed &
Salaheldin, 2005; Ghose, 2001; Lindner & Bagherzadeh, 2004).

United Kingdom (UK) has only one legal definition for SMEs that is defined in the
Act of 1985 (Shoniregun, 2004). SMEs are defined as having less than 250 employees,
turn over of no more than ￡22.8 million and a balance sheet total of no more than
￡11.4 million. In UK 99.9% enterprises are SMEs. The definition of SMEs in Europe
is similar as in UK with regard to employee numbers, viz.: employees are less than
250, but the turn over is no more than 50 million euros and balance sheet total is
around 43 million euros (University of Strathclyde Library, 2007). In United States
(US), SMEs are defined as having less than 75 employees and turn over of no more
than $25 million. In Australia, SME employees must be no more than 200 (Burgess,
2003).



2.2.2 SMEs in NZ
The Ministry of Economic Development (MED) is a department of NZ government
that manages NZ economic data. MED’s purpose is “to foster economic development
and prosperity for all New Zealanders” (Ministry of Economic Development, 2006).
.
There is no legal definition in NZ for SMEs. MED has classified SMEs to have no
more than 19 employees. Most enterprises in NZ are SMEs: around 96.4% (Ministry
of Economic Development, 2007). The number of employees in small enterprises is
no more than 5. The percentage of small enterprises is about 86.8% of all enterprises.
The number of employees in medium enterprises is from 6 to 19. The percentage of
medium enterprises is 9.6% of all enterprises (Ministry of Economic Development,
2007).

MED has made a report about SMEs and industry sectors using the Australian and NZ
Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC – see Table 1).
A Agriculture, forestry and fishing
B Mining
C Manufacturing
D Electricity, gas and water supply
E Construction
F Wholesale trade
G Retail trade
H Accommodation, cafes and restaurants
I Transport and storage
J Communication services
K Finance and insurance
L Property and business services
M Government administration and defence
N Education
O Health and community services
P Cultural and recreational services
Q Personal and other services
Table 1: ANZSIC Classifications (Ministry of Economic Development, 2005).

In 2005, MED had presented a classification of enterprises based on the number of
10
employees as a percentage of ANZSIC. These details are reflected in the table below.


Figure 1: ANZSIC Classifications (Ministry of Economic Development, 2005).

Figure 1 shows that 80% of wholesales trade enterprises have 0-5 employees and 15%
of wholesales trade enterprises have 6-19 employees. So 95% of wholesales trade
enterprises are SMEs and only 5% of wholesales trade enterprises are Large
Enterprises.


2.3 Impact of Mobile Devices on SMEs Worldwide
The impact of mobile devices in SMEs can be divided between mobile data and
mobile device functions. SMEs can be divided into three types: classical SMEs, SMEs
adopting IT/eCommerce and SMEs adopting mobile data technologies.


2.3.1 Conventional SMEs
Some SMEs still exist in the classical mould. They still use conventional practices for
communication. The mobile devices in these SMEs are playing only a limited role in
doing their business. Mobile devices are the most important way of communication
between SMEs and customer. Mobile devices also help communication within SMEs.
These SMEs use only some mobile device functions to improve their communication.
Mobile devices can be used for recording information and reminding people. The
impact of mobile devices on this functioning of SMEs is mainly for personal
11
communication. It is unlike the impact of mobile data on SMEs which is only for
business. However, mobile devices improving personal communication helps the
SMEs indirectly.


2.3.2 Current SMEs
Some SMEs have been upgraded for doing eCommerce. The factors of adopting
IT/eCommerce can be divided into two parts. The first part relates to internal factors
and the second part relates to external factors.


2.3.2.1 Internal Factors
Internal factors depend on owner/manager’s behavioural and attitudinal factors.

Figure 2: Framework of SME Adoption of Innovations (Van Akkeren & Cavaye,
1999)
Figure 2 shows how businesses adopt IT in their business.
1. Owners/managers perceive benefits of IT adoption which can be helpful and useful.
2. Owners/managers’ personal characteristics like assertiveness, rationality and

interaction influence the adoption of IT (Harker & Van Akkeren, 2002).
3. When the enterprise grows too large, control of staff and resources becomes
difficult. Owners/managers also perceive mobile technologies as part of IT to help
control staff and resources.


2.3.2.2 External Factors
External factors are based on economic considerations or Return on Investment.
Trading partners or customers may force the SME owner/manager to adopt IT. If the
trading partners or suppliers only allow placing orders online, SMEs must learn how
to use IT.
“The structural sophistication of the firm in terms of centralisation and complexity
will influence technology adoption in its ability to incorporate new technologies into
its work practices”.
When the size, sector and status of the enterprises are growing, enterprises will
consider adopting IT. Mobile devices as a part of IT will be adopted as well.
“The level of information intensity within the organisation may influence the owner to
adopt or not adopt a technology” (Harker & Van Akkeren, 2002).


2.4 The Impact of Mobile Data Technologies on SMEs
Mobile data technologies are wireless technologies which are built in mobile devices
and provide data connection between mobile devices and other devices or networks.
The impact of mobile devices in SMEs results from the mobile device functions and
mobile data. Mobile data technologies can improve the eCommerce as they are not
limited by place and time. “Mobile data technologies (MDT) which “marries” mobile
phones and eCommerce technologies is seen as eliminating time and distance as
barriers for regional businesses in their adoption of these technologies” (Van
Akkeren & Harker, 2002). MDT makes the eCommerce happen on mobile devices.
Mobile devices are acting as computers and MDT are acting as networks. Wireless
Application Protocol (WAP) is a MDT protocol that provides communication and
application protocol for wireless applications (Shih & Shim, 2002).
13

Figure 3: Business-based m-commerce framework scenario (Shih & Shim, 2002, p200).

“A travelling businessman in a business meeting can use a cellular phone to receive
inventory information and product quotes; thus providing his/her client with real-time
quotes of products. If a sale is made, the transaction information could be sent back
to a corporate inventory tracking system and be propagated through a company’s
ERP system. If necessary, the sale information may be forwarded to manager’s
computer, fax, printer, PDA, or the pagers in a corporation headquarter for an
approval. If a sold item results in an inventory back order, then the system can
automatically trigger a purchasing request to its vendor as depicted in figure 3”
(Shih & Shim, 2002). Shih’s article discusses how browsing in cell phones, Wireless
Markup Language (WML) and WAP protocol may help business and enable
m-commerce to come true. M-commerce is able to do the sales jobs which were
introducing products, checking stock availability and making orders. M-commerce
helps management of products and stock. MDT is a bridge between customer and
ERP system. It provides communication anytime and anywhere without the
dependence on a wired connection.

Figure 4: WAP communication schema (Shih & Shim, 2002, p201).

The clients use cell phones application to write WML/WMLS to input a request.
The request will be encoded to “minimize network transmission load” (Shih  &
Shim, 2002). Then it will be sent to the server.
The WAP gateway will decode the request before transforming it into a HTTP
compliant request by the protocol adapter.
The content server will receive the HTTP request and process the request. The
request will be sent to the backend services. After processing the request is
completed, the response will be sent back to the client.
The WAP gateway will encode and decode the response.
The client will get the response in decoded WML/WMLS. The result will be
showed to clients.
Not only does GPRS make m-commerce successful, but also 3G mobile data provide
more effective services for m-commerce as 3G mobile data provide up to 40 times
speed greater than GPRS. Wi-Fi and WiMax technologies provide lower cost and
faster speed for mobile devices for access to the Internet and LANs.


2.5 Impact of Mobile Devices on NZ SMEs

An earlier survey of SMEs adopting IT was done in Australia and NZ SMEs (Harker
& Van Akkeren, 2002). This survey includes deployment of MDT.

The survey covers 3 types: non-adopters, partial-adopters and full-adopters.
“Non-adopters were defined as those respondents, who did not use computers for
business purposes. Partial-adopters were those respondents who used computers for

business purposes, however did not use an Internet connection for business purpose.
Full-adopters were defined as those respondents who used a computer and an Internet
connection for business purposes, based on current usage of IT and then focused on
the needs of these three categories in relation to the newest, Mobile Data Technology
(MDT). Given the obvious link between the Internet and mobile phones, in terms of
MDT, these two areas were specifically addressed in the survey. ” (Harker & Van
Akkeren, 2002, p22). The final sample size was 482. Fifteen percent of SMEs were
non-adopters. Twenty-eight percent of SMEs were partial-adopters. Fifty-seven
percent of SMEs were full-adopters. Only four percent of SMEs used MDT in
full-adopters. Eighty-two percent SMEs used mobile phone for business purposes.
Only a small proportion did not use mobile phone and were non-adopters.
Twenty-five percent of those that used a mobile phone only used voice calling
function. Fourteen percent of those that used a mobile phone made over 30 calls per
day.

Mobile phones were most popular in the SMEs and over eighty-two percent of SMEs
used them. Some SMEs did not use computers and Internet. Not many SMEs adopted
MDT. Below is a table, which shows the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) between
adopter levels, and their relation to MDT by IT adopter level (Harker & Van Akkeren,
2002)

*Only statistically significant results are shown.

From Table 2, it is apparent that full-adopters were most excited about MDTs in this
category of SMEs. “A key bank of questions in the questionnaire focused respondents
on the use of MDT in a business setting and asked them to state to what extent they
agreed or disagreed with a set of statements” (Harker & Van Akkeren, 2002, p24).

About eighty-six percent full-adopters will wait before investing. Almost eighty
percent of full-adopters are interested in using mobile device to access email.
Sixty-four percent of owners/managers feel excited about MDTs. Around sixty
percent of full-adopters use MDTs for trading with customers, suppliers, and for
banking and other administration, including the monitoring of business premises.
Over fifty percent of participants are able to access the Internet, monitor or operate
17
equipment. About fifty-two percent adopt MDTs because of competitive pressure.

Fifty-four percent of participants were interested in acquiring MDT.

A recent study about eCommerce adoption in small business in NZ was done in 2007
(Al-Qirim, 2007). There were three groups of eCommerce adopters in SMEs. The first
group was classified as “low level adopters”, second group as “advanced level
adopters” and the third group as “high adopters”. Low level SMEs were only adopting
simple email and web pages. Advanced level SMEs were adopting fully functional
and interactive websites. High adopter SMEs were adopting different eCommerce
technologies including fully functional and interactive website, Intranet and Extranet
technologies. (Al-Qirim, 2007)

Al-Qirim in an earlier study of 2005 discusses factors that significantly influence
eCommerce adoption in SMEs. These are stated below:
1. Relative advantage
2. Cost
3. Compatibility
4. Size
5. Information intensity of products
6. Support from technology vendors
7. Pressure from suppliers / buyers
19
8. Competition
9. CEO’s innovativeness
10. CEO’s involvement (Al-Qirim, 2005)

Julia Ngatuere’s research (Ngatuere, 2006) relating to ICTs in NZ SMEs in 2004,
states that about two out of six SMEs had business plans which were out-of-date.
Only two SMEs had business plans and IT plans (also out-of-date) and only one SME
had budgeted for ICT every year. “These two MEs and one SE statedthat they knew
how to write an ICT plan and would plan for a long period of time, yet the SE did not
have a plan at all.  The other three interviewees would only plan for a short period
of time.” None of the SMEs had a current ICT plan. As per Julia’s research, use of
ICT in NZ SMEs was not so popular (Ngatuere, 2006).

IT adoption is an integral part of eCommerce. MDTs could further help SMEs with
increased chances to upgrade eCommerce to mCommerce and thereby improve
business productivity.

3. Research Methodology
A qualitative research methodology (case study) was adopted. Primary data were
gathered from interviews.
“Qualitative approach is one in which the inquirer often makes knowledge claims
based primarily on constructivist perspectives or advocacy/ participatory perspectives
or both. It also uses strategies of inquiry such as narratives, phenomenologies,
ethnographies, grounded theory studies, or case studies. The researcher collects
open-ended, emerging data with the primary intent of developing themes from the
data” (Creswell, 2003).

The case study is the most popular qualitative method that has been used in
information systems research. A case study is “an empirical inquiry that investigates
a contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context, especially when the
boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” (Yin, 2002).
The case study includes six steps. They are:
1. “Determine and define the research questions
2. Select the cases and determine data gathering and analysis techniques
3. Prepare to collect the data
4. Collect data in the field
5. Evaluate and analyze the data
6. Prepare the report” (Soy, 2006).


3.1 Research Question
The primary research question of this study was: “What is the impact of mobile
devices on wholesale trade SMEs in the Auckland region?” This study was intended
to answer secondary questions such as:
1. What type of mobile devices do they use?
2. What type of functions / services of this mobile device(s) are used?
3. What purpose(s) do the mobile devices serve?

21

3.2 Data Collection Methods
Two types of data were collected for this research. Primary data were obtained by
interviewing employees, managers and owners of SMEs to answer the research
questions. In gathering primary data, the interview technique was selected as a tool for
data collection. Interviews will involve people being interviewed individually
(face-to-face or by telephone) or in groups:

The secondary data were analysed from the literature review. This literature included
books, periodicals, electronic sources, government documents, and product manuals.
The literature sources for this research were:
1. Libraries (UNITEC libraries, North shore city Library)
2. Database (EBSCO HOST, ACM, Book24x7)
3. Internet search engines (Google, msn, yahoo, Baidu).
4. Bookshops.

3.3 Method of Study
This study discusses the impact of mobile devices (including cell phones, smart
phones and PDAs) on SMEs in Auckland, NZ. Different mobile devices have different
impact on SMEs. Defining mobile devices and SMEs are basic to understanding
before discussing their impact. After defining mobile devices and SMEs, this study
focuses on the impact of mobile devices in SMEs.

Fifteen wholesale businesses within the Auckland region were approached by phone
or email for the interview process. Five of them were selected from wholesale trade
section in the Auckland Yellow Pages phone book. Another five were selected from
the wholesale advertising section in the NZ Herald and Mandarin Times. The last five
were found on the Internet by using Google and the keywords “Auckland, NZ
Wholesale SME”. Eight (53%) wholesale businesses that were contacted agreed to
interviews.
22

Of the eight wholesale businesses, one wholesale business was invited for a pilot
interview. From this initial interview, one question was deleted and three questions
were modified.

The question “What do you use mobile devices for?” was deleted.
The first question was modified from:
“How many people are employed full-time?
□ None   □1-5   □6-19   □20 or more”
to:
“How many people are employed full-time?
□ None     □ Other (Please specify) _______________________”

The second question was modified from:
“How many people are employed part-time?
□ None   □1-5   □6-19   □20 or more”
to:
“How many people are employed part-time?
□ None    □ Other (Please specify) _______________________”.

The third question was modified from:
“What cell phone, smart phone and PDA functions / services does the organisation
use?
□ None    □Voice Calling    □ Video Calling    □ SMS    □ MMS
□ Email    □ Internet    □ Listen to music    □ Entertainment
□ Addressing Book    □ Calendar    □ Other (Please Specify) _____________”
to:
“What cell phone, smart phone and PDA functions / services does the organisation
use?
□ None    □Voice Calling    □ Video Calling    □ SMS    □ MMS
□ Email    □ Internet    □ Listen to music    □ Entertainment
□ Addressing Book    □ Calendar    □ Advertising    □ Banking
23
□ Accessing Information    □ Other (Please Specify) _____________”

The finalised interview questions were used with the other wholesale SMEs. Twelve
participants completed the interview from the remaining seven companies. Overall 13
participants from eight companies were interviewed.

The final version of questionnaire had 22 questions. It was divided into 3 types of
questions, one option questions (10), one or more options questions (8) and open
questions (3). One option questions were such that respondents had to select one
option from a list. One or more option questions were such that respondents could
select one or more option from a list. Open questions did not include lists of options,
so respondents could answer as they wished.

One option questions are listed below:
How many people are employed full-time?
How many people are employed part-time?
Does your business belong to wholesale trade enterprise?
Location of business?
How many cell phones are there?
How many smart phones?
How many PDAs?
How many employees operate these cell phones?
How many employees operate these smart phones?
How many employees operate these PDAs?

One or more options questions are listed below:
Position held？
Which products do you deal with as your main business?
Does the business use a mobile device?
What cell phone, smart phone and PDA functions / services does the organisation
use?
What type of mobile connection does the business use?
Which functions of mobile devices are used to communicate with employees?
24
Which functions of mobile devices are used to communicate with your supplier to
place orders / purchase?
Which functions of mobile devices are used to communicate with customers?

Open questions are listed below:
What benefits if any, has your business gained from using a mobile device (cell
phone, smart phone and PDA)?
Do you see any barriers that are stopping you from using a mobile device (cell
phone, smart phone and PDA) for your business?
In your organisation who made the decision for use of cell phone or smart phone
or PDA?
Lastly, is there any other information that you think I should know that would help me
understand your business and the use of mobile devices (cell phone, smart phone and
PDA) for this business?

25
4. Data Gathering

4.7 Advantage and Disadvantage of Mobile devices in
Enterprises
4.7.1 Question 12:
“What benefits if any, has your business gained from using a mobile device (cell
phone, smart phone and PDA)?”
39
Answers were received for advantage of mobile devices:
1. Can access work out of office.
2. Easy and fast communication
3. Keeping in touch
4. Anywhere any time communication
5. Contacts customer directly instead of classical land line.
Most respondents indicated that easy and fast communication was possible.

4.7.2 Question 13:

phone, smart phone and PDA) for your business?”
Answers were received for disadvantage of mobile devices:
1. No disadvantages
2. Not good for health
3. Costs too much
4. Battery time too short (frequent charging of battery required)
5. Customers calling after hours
Thirty-one percent of respondents thought there were no disadvantages associated
with the use of mobile devices. Another thirty-one percent of respondents thought
mobile devices were not good for health. Fifteen percent of respondents thought they
cost too much. Only seven percent of respondents thought the battery required
frequent charging.

devices. Four (31%) respondents stated that business owners initiated the use of
mobile devices.

4.9 Other Issues about Mobile Devices
4.9.1 Question 12:
“Lastly, is there any other information that you think I should know that would help
me understand your business and the use of mobile devices (cell phone, smart phone
and PDA) for this business?”
Answers are below:
Take photo easily.
Cost should be cheap.
More choices for customers
When we are away, it is possible to access our work.
Sixty-nine percent of respondents (9) did not respond to this question.
5. Data Analysis & Interpretation
Analysis of the data gathered from the interviews covered above, is divided into 8
parts in this section. The data gathered from the 13 interviewees has been analysed
across all 8 enterprises as well as within the enterprises themselves.
41

5.1 Position of Respondents
All Participants were divided into three groups viz: owners, managers and employees.
The respondents were evenly split with one third belonging to owners, one third
belonging to managers and one third belonging to employees group.

5.2 Core Business
All 8 businesses belonged to wholesale trade enterprise.

Over two thirds of the companies were selling Kitchen Products, Jewellery, Stationery
and tools. Over half of them (5 companies) were selling shoes, bags and toys. A
quarter of them (2 companies) were selling clothes. Only one company was selling
wood.

Number of employees of enterprise was calculated in terms of number of equivalent
full-time employees. Two part-time employees were counted as one full-time
employee. If the enterprise’s number of employee is 0 to 5, the enterprise is classed as
a small enterprise. If the enterprise’s number of employees is 6 to 19, the enterprise is
classed as a medium enterprise. If the enterprise’s employee number is over 19, the
enterprise is classed as a large enterprise.
Size of enterprise Numbers of Employees Respondents
Small Enterprises 0-5 6
Medium Enterprises 6-19 2
Large Enterprises Over 19 0
Table 8: Size of the enterprises
Table 8 shows that all the enterprises which were interviewed are SMEs.

Small Enterprises
Medium
Enterprises

Figure 24: Size of Enterprises

Figure 24 shows the percentage of small enterprises and medium enterprises. About
75% of enterprises are small enterprises. Other 25% of them belong to medium
enterprises.

Location of all enterprises was in Auckland.

5.3 Use of Mobile Devices (by Type)
Cell phone is the most popular mobile device because cell phones have the longest
history in mobile devices. All SMEs were using cell phones. Only one (13%) SME
was using a smart phone. Smart phones were developed much later than cell phones.
Many respondents did not know what a smart phone was. About 25% of the SMEs
were using PDAs. Most respondents knew about PDAs, but did not have any due to
costs being too expensive and functions being too complicated.

All SMEs in this interview have cell phones. About 13% of the SME have 1 or 2 cell
phones. About 25% of the SMEs have 3 to 5 cell phones. Over half, about 62% of the
SMEs have more than 5 cell phones.

Smart phones are not as popular as cell phones. Around 13% of the SMEs have 1 or 2
43
smart phones.

Most SMEs knew about PDAs. Around 25% of the SMEs have 1 or 2 PDAs. 75% of
SMEs don’t use PDAs.

Half of the SMEs have over 5 employees operating cell phones. About 13% of
respondents have no employee operating the cell phones. This 13% of the SMEs have
cell phone but business owners were operating / using those cell phones. About 38%
of SMEs have 3 to 5 employees operate cell phones.

Only 13% of SMEs have 1 or 2 employees operating smart phones. Most SMEs,
about 87% of SMEs do not have smart phones.

About 25% of the SMEs have 1 or 2 employees operating PDAs. About 75% of the
SMEs do not have PDAs.

5.4 Mobile Device Functions / Services
Figure15 shows the usage of mobile device functions and services in SMEs. About
92% of the respondents used mobile devices for voice calling because voice calling is
the basic function of mobile devices. About 85% of the respondents used SMS and
address book feature of mobile devices. SMS is very common function after mobile
device technology 2G. There were 15% of the respondents using video calling. The
latest mobile device technology 3G was not used by most respondents. MMS, Internet
and Email are used by about 23% of respondents Around half of the respondents used
mobile devices to listen to music, play games (entertainment) and arrange meetings
(calendar). Lots of entertainment features were combined in mobile devices. About
15% of the respondents used mobile devices to send SMS to customers for advertising
and to access mobile banking.

44
5.5 Mobile Data Technologies (MDTs)
3G Mobile Data technology was used by only 15% respondents. 3G Mobile Data
technology was a new technology. Not many respondents knew about it.

About 38% of the respondents used GPRS. Most respondents were aware of GPRS.
Due to the costs being high, not many respondents used it.

About 23% of the respondents used Wi-Fi to contact the office LAN or home LAN.
Not many mobile devices have Wi-Fi features. Not many offices or homes had
wireless LAN.

Most popular MDT was Bluetooth which was used by 69% of the respondents. Most
mobile devices have Bluetooth features. Mobile devices can transfer data between
different mobile devices. It does not require a wireless LAN or other devices.

Second popular MDT was IrDA used by 62% of the respondents. IrDA is an earlier
technology. Most mobile devices and laptops have this feature. People can easily use
IrDA feature to transfer data between different mobile devices or mobile devices to
laptop.

In spite of WiMax being a new technology, it was not very popular in the market.
None of the respondents used WiMax at all.

5.6 Mobile Devices Usage in Business (by Function)
Voice calling is the most important function for SMEs contacting employees,
suppliers and customers. About 92% percent of respondents used voice calling to
contact employees and customers. About 77% of the respondents used voice calling to
contact suppliers. Around 50% of the respondents used SMS to contact employees and
customers. Only 23% of the respondents used SMS to contact suppliers because
overseas suppliers may not be able to receive SMS. About 8% of the respondents used
video calling to contact suppliers and customers because 3G phone were not very
45
popular. MMS was used by 23% of the respondents to contact employees, and 8% of
the respondents to contact suppliers and customers because MMS was not popular and
cost too much. Only 8% respondents contact employees and customers by email using
mobile devices. About 15% of the respondents contact suppliers by email in mobile
devices. Most respondents were using PCs to send email. Only 8% of the respondents
used mobile Internet to contact employees, suppliers and customers. Most respondents
were using PCs to connect to Internet.

5.7 Advantage and Disadvantage of Mobile Devices in SMEs
Answers were received for advantage of mobile devices:

instead of the classical land line.

Answers were received for disadvantage of mobile devices:
About 31% of the respondents thought there were no disadvantages of mobile devices.
About 31% of the respondents thought that mobile devices were not good for health.
A small proportion (15%) of the respondents thought they cost too much. Only 7% of
the respondents thought the battery required frequent charging.


5.8 Decision to Use Mobile Devices
Mobile devices were very popular in the market and most respondents had them.
About 69% of the respondents stated that employees themselves decided to use the
mobile devices. About 31% of the respondents stated that business owners initiated
the use of mobile devices. These 31% thought mobile devices were used for business
purposes so business owner should supply mobile devices to employees.

6. Summary of Findings
The analysis and interpretation of the data gathered revealed findings as summarised
below.

6.1 The Impact of Mobile Devices on Wholesale Trade SMEs
in Auckland Region
The impact of mobile devices on wholesale trade SMEs can be traced to SMEs
respondents’ research questionnaire relating to the advantages and disadvantages.

Most respondents, about ninety-two percent thought mobile devices provided easy,
fast and anywhere anytime communication. Mobile devices improved communication
among SMEs employees, as well as communication between SMEs and their
customers and suppliers. Mobile devices provided greater business opportunities for
SMEs.  The annual turnover of SMEs had also increased as a result of these
additional business opportunities.

Mobile devices provided additional benefits to SMEs but also brought in some
concerns. Thirty-one percent of respondents thought mobile devices were not good for
health. Seven percent of respondents thought the battery required frequent charging
hence an impediment. Concerns included mobile devices shutting off due to battery
being low while important things were being discussed. Another seven percent of
respondents noted that customers called after hours, as a result of which the mobile
devices had a nuisance value

6.2 Mobile Device Types Currently Used by SME Owners
and Employees
The usage type of mobile devices along with their respective usage percentages are
47
covered below:
Cell phones are used by ninety-two percent of respondents.
Smart phones are used by eight percent of respondents.
PDAs are used by twenty-three percent of respondents.
Most respondents are using cell phones. Smart phones were new cell phones
combined with PDA features but most respondents did not know what smart phones
were. However, most respondents knew what a PDA was, but only twenty-three
percent of respondents were using PDAs.


6.3 Functions / Services of Mobile Devices Used by SME
Owners and Employees
Functions / services of mobile devices which are used in SMEs are included below:
1. Voice Calling
2. Video Calling
3. SMS
4. MMS
5. Email
6. Internet
7. Listen to music
8. Entertainment
9. Addressing Book
10. Calendar
11. Advertising
12. Banking
13. Accessing Information
14. Calculator
15. MDTs

Ninety-two percent of respondents were using voice calling in mobile devices.
Eighty-five percent of respondents were using SMS and address book in mobile
48
devices. Voice calling, SMS and address book were the main services and functions
for communication in mobile devices from 2G technology. Around fifty percent of
respondents were using mobile device to listen to music, playing games
(entertainment) and arrange meetings (calendar). Technologies that followed 2G
technology, presented mobile devices that not only provided calling, but also provided
additional functions for work and entertainment. Only twenty-three percent of
respondents were using video calling, MMS, email and Internet because of these
services were latest technologies and cost too much. No more than fifteen percent of
respondents were using mobile device for advertising, accessing information and
calculator.

Later MDTs included 3G mobile data technology, GPRS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, IrDA,
WiMax. Over sixty-two percent of respondents used Bluetooth and IrDA for data
transfer between different mobiles or mobile devices and laptops. These two MDTs
did not involve any additional recurring cost, hence they were very popular.
Thirty-eight percent of respondents used GPRS. GPRS is the older technology since it
is 2G. There were not many people using GPRS because the cost of GPRS was
comparively expensive. Wi-Fi and 3G mobile data technology are later technologies.
Not many respondents seemed to be aware of these technologies, and only
twenty-three percent of respondents used them. None of the respondents used WiMax
because WiMax is not very popular in the market currently.

6.4 What Purposes Do the Mobile Devices Serve
The main purpose that mobile devices serve is communicating with employees,
suppliers and customers.

Mobile device services for communication include voice calling, video calling, SMS,
MMS, email and Internet. Voice calling is the main service of communication.
Ninety-two percent of respondents used voice calling to contact employees and
customers and seventy-seven percent of respondents used voice calling to contact
suppliers. Around fifty percent of respondents used SMS to contact employees and
customers, but only twenty-three percent of respondents used SMS to contact
49
suppliers. Using mobile device contacting suppliers was less than for contacting
employees and customers because most suppliers were overseas. Possibly the
contractual natural of commercial transactions between suppliers and the SMEs may
be yet another reason. The cost of mobile device calling overseas was more expensive
than landline so they used the landline more than mobile device for calling overseas.
SMS was perceived as a feature not guaranteed to be received overseas. Due to the
cost of video calling, MMS, email and Internet being too expensive, there were not
many respondents who used video calling, MMS, email and Internet to contact
employees, suppliers and customers.

50
7. Conclusion
Mobile devices are becoming more powerful and more important in the IT industry.
(Barnes, 2002) From data analysis and interpretation, this study was found some
limitations.
7.1 Limitations
Survey limitation
There were only 13 respondents from 8 SMEs covered in this survey, which is a rather
small sample size for a large population base of SMEs in the Auckland region.

Technology limitation
Some technologies have yet to be released fully in the market such as WiMax and are
not very popular as yet in Auckland, NZ.

Knowledge limitation
Lots of owners, managers and of SMEs are not aware of new technologies. They also
use only simple straightforward features of their mobile devices.

Scope
This being a six month dissertation study, the scope has been accordingly limited to
achieve the desired objectives.

Language limitation
As English is the second language of the author, a lot of trouble with English grammar
and spelling was encountered.



7.2 Implications and Recommendations for Future Study
This study includes literature reviews that cover IT adoption in SMEs (Van Akkeren
51
& Cavaye, 1999), impact of MDTs on SMEs (Shih & Shim, 2002) and discusses the
adoption of MDTs on SMEs of Australia and NZ (Harker & Van Akkeren, 2002).
Ngatuere’s study relating to how NZ SMEs use ICT stated wide variations of ICT use
by SMEs. Such as one SME said “the deployment of IT is dependent on the owner of
the business and how far they want to go in terms of updating and using the latest
technology, how much time and cost they are prepared to do” (Ngatuere, 2006). ICT is
a large area and growing fast. Keeping up with the latest technology, would require
time and money.

This study covers MDTs and associated mobile devices with different functions and
services of the MDTs. This study also brings to light information regarding benefits of
mobile devices and MDTs to SMEs. SMEs may be prompted to adopt new mobile
devices and MDTs to enhance their productivity.

This study focused on the impact of mobile devices on Auckland, SMEs. It included
types of mobile devices, functions and services, and the purpose of using the mobile
devices.

This study may also help mobile device manufactures and application developers to
target the marketing of mobile devices especially for SMEs.

Future studies could cover mobile device usage for accessing orders and checking
stock, and development of management systems. SMEs could use MDTs to achieve
immediate access to the management system anywhere and anytime. To design such a
management system, future studies may consider questions as covered below:
What kind of programming language should be used in the system?
What kind of database should be used in the system?
What and how would security and maintenance be carried out in the system?

Mobile devices have become an important part of SMEs not only for communication
but also for data transfer. Growth of mobile devices is faster than other devices such
as PCs in the IT industry.
