Abstract—The purpose of this document is to provide an
overview on the growth on mobile phone and PDA devices and
use in business-oriented modern day life style. The explosion of
smartphones in enterprise and personal computing heighten the
concerns of security and privacy of users. Now a day’s use of
mobile is in every walk of life like shopping, trading, paying bill
and even using internet banking. But with these facilities some
draw backs are also there. Recent studies have shown that
applications can host new types of malware. This discussion
explores smartphone security through several research works
and how user himself can avoid from data hacking and other
insecurities.
Keywords—Smartphone; PDA; security; business-oriented;
applications
I. INTRODUCTION
The main intention of this manuscript is to give an
impression on the growth of mobile phone and PDA devices,
which are now indispensable for our business-oriented modern
day lifestyle. This document also put emphasis on those
technology risks that are associated with using these devices as
well as available safeguards to diminish any problems. This
information will help organizations to improve their levels of
security and to decrease such occurrences concerning the use of
these handheld wireless devices. It can be envisioned that the
more mobile devices continue to accelerate, the more
sophisticated applications can be predicted. [9] Internet
connectivity has helped accelerate the tendency of mobile
phones from ‘voice-centric to data-centric’ networking
systems. These two worlds are gradually converging to support
each other. [7]
Since security concerns have supreme importance in fiscal
transactions or a mobile payment, that’s why it is important
that the attacker present in this application are examined by
taking a holistic view of the vulnerabilities. [6] The increasing
demand and functionalities of the hi-definition Smartphone
category of mobile devices will make an attractive target for
malware writers and infiltration of malware on mobile devices
can raise serious business and safety concerns. [13] Moreover,
Not sufficient security in wireless connection may tempt to
numerous unlawful attackers including but not limited to
hacking, fraud of system integrity, surveillance and loss or
stealing of the device itself [14] In contrast, the security of
handheld devices cannot be maintained without users’
involvement. Users must be instructed about what measures to
follow and what precautions to take while they use
organization-issued equipment or a personally owned one.
When taking full advantage of all the facilities afforded by cell
phones or PDAs, it is important that the user should have a
good knowledge of the security safeguards. [9]
On a related note the current economic environment and the
advent of new technologies has interested organizations in
availing the Cloud storage services provider model. Cloud
storage providers can suggest cost-cutting measures by using
equal storage capacity to meet organizations’ needs to initiate
transitional cost-savings measures for their customer base. [21]
From 2010 on a majority of the cellular networks started
undertaking switch-over from the existing third generation
communications systems (3G) to the fourth generation systems
(4G). This (4G) system mostly incorporates broadband IP
based heterogeneous multimedia services that let users use
diverse networks on an anytime and anywhere basis. [22] The
4G system is a modified version of third generation mobiles
and certainly is a ‘must have’ gadget for the organization. [18]
II. THE COMMONLY USED MOBILE FEATURES
In today’s high-tech business-oriented lifestyle cell (or
mobile) phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) have
turn into indispensable. For the most part these small and
economical devices are being used for making calls, sending
short text messages and supporting Enhanced Messaging
Services (EMS). They can also be used for Personal
Information Management (PIM), i.e. phonebook, calendar, and
notepad, etc. These tiny devices can perform a whole array of
functions that previously could only be done on desktop
computers. Computers generally perform many functions such
as sending and retrieving e-mails, web browsing, retrieving and
modifying documents, delivering and making presentations,
and can access available data from remote servers. Currently
mobile device are now being equipped with built in devices
like camera, GPS receiver, removable media card incision, and
also are host to a vast assortment of wireless interfaces,
including but not limited to, infrared, Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi),
Bluetooth connectivity, and more than one type of cellular
interfaces, etc. [9]
Research and advances in Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) have resulted in today’s high-end smart
phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), which now
possess fairly equal processing power and memory storage
capacity that was previously the hallmark of Personal
Computers (PCs). Today’s smart phones converge with full
featured mobile phones in that they function much like

computers. Users can now make phone calls and run
applications, besides accessing and stockpiling useable data
communications from shared networks and the Internet. In the
meantime the memory cards of cell phones are now
approaching the maximum of 8 GB capacity, which aims to
provide adequate space to stockpile business information. Since
highly developed mobile phones have the capacity to connect
to the Internet and access websites and also have e-mail and
multimedia set-ups, mobile devices are increasingly more
“data-centric” compared to when they were traditionally
“voice-centric” networks. [13]
Mobile manufacturing companies are taking the initiative to
install those potential mobile enabling applications on mobile
podiums, for instance Symbian™, OS, Microsoft™ and
Windows™. Owing to the improved capacity, induction of new
applications, available service support on cellular as well as
local-area networks along with Bluetooth connectivity, the
business community has an ever-increasing demand for mobile
devices. These full-featured devices are improving workers’
output by giving them ready access to the information they
require. Even though these devices can boost competence and
productivity, they also possess some inherent threats to
organizations. What if the classified corporate and private data
goes astray or a device is stolen? The types of threats that
appear in the shape of spam, malware infections, and hacking
will be discussed in the proceeding chapters. [13]
A. An overview of device transformation
The evolution of mobile telephony can be traced back to the
continuous socio-historical development of the landline phone
industry. One major reason for the acceptance of telephones at
the beginning of the 20th century was “security”. However,
with the emerging American economy “business concerns”
became yet another good reason for acquiring a landline phone.
From1910 onwards the social use of the telephone became
another factor for acquiring a landline phone. It is pertinent to
mention here that the main disparity between the social setting
of the early days of both landline and mobile telephones was
the fear of breach of confidentiality, resulting from neighbors
trying to ‘snoop in’ on their next door neighbors’ conversations
or business rivals abusing switch boards, etc.
Gradually, handheld devices began to appear in different
shapes and sizes. The first cell or mobile phones appeared in
the United State of America in 1978, after AT&T Company
carried out its test communications under the auspices of the
Federal Communications Commission in Chicago, Newark and
New Jersey simultaneously. The device then had the weight
and size of a brick and was restricted to voice communications
only. From then on phenomenal improvements have been made
in the appearance and performance of handsets, and the
infrastructural capacity of their networking. By and large the
capacities of these devices may vary but at the heart of
technology there are certain similarities as well. In 1993 Apple
introduced its very first PDA, “the Newton”. Battery powered
and compact in size PDAs are intrinsically designed for
mobility as they stockpile a user’s data in the form of solid
state memory rather than putting it on a hard disk.
Nevertheless, certain vulnerabilities are accredited to the use of
PDAs as preserved data in unpredictable memory may be lost
and/or erased if the device is re-organized for some reason. In
many ways, PDAs are akin to handheld (PCs) and are not used
for telephony. Mobile phones on the other hand, are much like
PDAs apart from an important disparity in that they support
more than one radio interface to cellular telecommunications
networks. Moreover, mobile phones have a different legacy as
well in that mobile services have enabled “follow me
anywhere/always on” telephony”.
What makes cell phones different from the rest of the
handheld devices is their ability to communicate through
cellular networks. In cellular networks - as their name suggests
- cells play a pivotal role in reprocessing radio frequencies in a
restricted radio band by allowing more and more calls to
happen. Taking an example from the U.S.A. where a diversity
of digital cellular networks is thriving which pursues dissimilar
and incompatible sets of standards, it is evident that virtually
everyone in that country is now covered by a digital network of
some kind. [18] Two leading digital cellular network operating
in the U.S.A are Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) and
Global System for Mobile Communications (GSm). Common
cellular network are Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
and integrated Digital Enhanced Network (iDEN). iDEN use
proprietary protocol while other follow standardized open
protocols. Last but not least a digital version of the ingenious
parallel standards as designed for cellular telephone service
also subsists in the field and  to date has been referred to as
recognized as Digital Advanced Mobile Phone Service D
AMPS). [9]
B.  Some common trends in mobile devices
The omnipresent exploitation of mobile systems, extensive
use of the Internet as well as the speedy development in
wireless technologies [18] in recent years is the contributing
factors that have improved the functions and characteristics of
mobile handheld devices. In particular, cell phones have
witnessed those features which were once only accessible in
high-end smart phones and gradually introduced into more
basic phones. For instance, LCD screens have progressed from
the colorless display to grayscale and finally to high resolution
colored display technologies along with built-in cameras
which, some time ago, were considered a scarcity. Today,
however, they are just as ordinary feature. In the same way text
messages have converted to chat messages and then
multimedia messages and more enhanced messages, i.e. EMS
and now ending with e-mail. At present mobile devices are
expected to develop into more complex, powerful,
communicative functions at high-speed and having better
processing capabilities and greater bandwidth, apart from
having the facility of “always on” connection such as those
existing on desktop computers. As a consequence of the said
developments, cell phones are becoming more of a depository
for a wide range of private and organizational data and the core
is changing to packet data as opposed to voice data. [9].
With the advent of broadband interactive multimedia
applications in wireless devices the plethora of new trends and
functionalities has overwhelmed certain device features. A few
have been discussed in the preceding paragraphs and this does
not include simple icon-menu, touch-pad, and artificial
intelligence-based natural languages. The said devices and
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013

communication systems have also developed especially
designed software to curb any instances of encroachment,
namely:
 Invasion detective system - detects intruders and takes
defensive measures upon the information it has,
 Anti-virus software - restrains malicious codes and
offers support for reliable servers and applications.
 Almost every individual device will perform as:
 personal organizer - alarms, clocks, calculators, time
zones, flash lights, calendars, dictionaries, compasses,
video and music player, pocket PCs with office-type
applications (for example, Blackberry).
 Gauge meters - to measure temperature, air pressure,
humidity, and heartbeat, etc.
 virtual keys - to secure ID cards, digital cash, tag
readers, remote control devices, pagers, locating
sensitive devices, etc. [18]
In such devices there is still room for new applications by
new invigorating platforms such as Android. Android is a
relatively new and dynamic platform that possesses some of the
most sophisticated phone applications and is theoretically in
conflict with iPhone. Android is striving hard to launch as
many operating systems as possible whilst iPhone intends to
get the best users experience by imposing restrictions to its
hardware and software standards. [19]
From 2010 a majority of the cellular networks started
switching over from the existing third generation
communications systems (3G) to the fourth generation systems
(4G). This (4G) system mostly incorporates broadband IP
based multimedia services in diverse networks. 4G systems
represent a modified version of third generation mobiles and
certainly have an edge over them. Their basic objectives entail
higher transmission rates, larger storage capacity, higher
frequency and greater bandwidth, better coverage and conduit
features, cheaper access costs, higher quality of service with
lower system costs, and a single yet omnipresent, multi
functional and multi-band intelligent device that can handle a
variety of contents. [18]
C. An insight into futuristic devices what technologies may
prevail
As mobile devices accelerate in terms of services offered,
the more sophisticated applications can be predicted. For
instance, like “Google Earth”, today the Global Satellite
Positioning (GPS) system has enabled wireless devices to run
applications for designing software that can provide a full
socio-historical account of an image or video of any building
besides indicating its geographical location. Software can even
detect whether an apartment house on a boulevard is for rent or
sale, or whether it is mortgaged and even who owns it. If a
picture has some text the enabling technologies of these
devices can translate it into English. These devices have
supermarket applications and can scan products’ barcodes;
iPhone has the same applications. [9]
In Europe drink and potato chips vending machine services
initially started using mobile applications for immediate
purchases. In recent years, Telstra, one of Australia's leading
telecommunications provider companies, has taken the
initiative by carrying out an exclusive "dial a coke" on trial
basis where everyone can purchase a coke by making a phone
call from a “Telstra mobile” to a number on a coke vending
machine. By utilizing location sensitive mobile applications a
person may find the nearest petrol and/or gas station or
comparing prices when they go shopping, etc.[17]
The futuristic wireless devices can be envisioned to
perform endless business functions such as:
 Electronic wallets - mobile phones may be used to hold
credit cards and other monetary information for making
electronic transactions. For this purpose mobile
handsets are basically used as a security coupon
registered with the user’s identity. When the transaction
is done its verification directly corresponds to the user
either by a phone call or SMS. In some parts of the
world they can practically be used to buy small-value
things such as tickets, public transport, parking fees
and/or retailing machinery, etc. [9]
 Speech recognition and converter - while the data
available on mobiles continues to accelerate and mostly
mobile devices have become “data centric” instead of
“voice centric” , voice leads the field and will remain a
dominant form of communications.  New built-in
technologies in the wireless devices can now translate
verbal communications into transcript form to shun the
use of alpha-numeric key pads, etc. [18]
 Speech fusion - this innovative technology can translate
e-mails into understandable verbal communications in
order to listen to the received e-mails. This system can
be dubbed the “automated interpreter”. [18]
 Optical/Visual character recognition - wireless handheld
devices can also assist and enhance learning. As its
name implies, visual features of these phones may
convert any hand-written content to a typed-written
format with a high degree of precision and with the help
of its built-in learning apparatus.  [18]
 Voice activation - the enabling technologies of wireless
devices can bring voice-control to steer websites and to
replace a long chain of chronological input with an
automatic “voice-menu-driven” phone system. [18]
 The expanding functionalities of mobile phones have
opened the door to refined applications. In this context
Android is exceptional in that Google is aggressively
developing its Linux-based mobile phone operating
system. Google has formed an alliance of hardware,
software, and telecommunication companies to
consolidate Android development. As long as
fragmentation issues can be avoided, Android phones
are well ahead in the development stage since Android
devices are tailored for specific hardware and user
interface upgrades. [19]

D. Some examples of user-related success stories
Mobile phone-enabling technologies and similar
applications have widely been accepted in Australia. Australia
is a country where a substantial amount of revenue stems from
subscribers using mobile phones. In recent years, the trend of
sending text messages has increased considerably and this has
implications for M-commerce users. An empirical study
indicates that approximately 300 million text messages are sent
by 11.5 million mobile phone users on a per month average
over Australia’s three leading mobile networks. Nevertheless, it
is widely believed that the inception of a third generation (3G)
mobile networking system is the driving force in expanding M
commerce applications.[17]
Application writers and operators are working on new
business models which are able to generate a sufficient amount
of revenue that can pay for new high-speed wireless networks.
The billing systems, however, have been identified as a
significant factor in retarding M-commerce services and
applications to an extent. Rapid technological progress is the
answer to these issues, and it is envisaged that M-commerce
will be much more widely accepted in the future.  [17]
Another important issue that needs the attention of mobile
network operators is to decide and What the importance of
emerging world of M-Commerce if it is restricted for business
to-business or business-to-consumer and/or consumerto
consumer transactions or will expand their services to act as a
reservoir for offering credit for airtime, or for goods and can
provide loans or billing services to intermediary companies. To
capture the small business market, operators can carry
transactions between consumers and business for cash
withdrawals, payments through mobile phone for soft drinks,
car wash, train tickets as well as for larger dealings through
debit card, VISA™ and MasterCard™, etc.[8]
1) Swissair
IBM has developed an application through which they can
facilitate the Swissair’s preferred passengers by sending
updates for their flights. Passengers get all updates on mobile
screen and subsequently printed on their boarding passes, i.e.
departure time, gate and seat number etc In case of any changes
in the flight schedule the passengers receive automatic updates
on their phone display.[8]
2) Woolwich
Woolwich was the first British bank who introduces
internet banking for customers using WAP. With the help of
this they can manage their bank account personally. Customer
services make sure to customer that their transaction safely
transmitted from WPA phone to Woolwich server. [8]
III. E-BUSINESS TRENDS THROUGH MOBILE DEVICES
Mobile commerce or M-Commerce as its name implies can
be defined as “the use of handheld wireless devices to
communicate, interact, and/or conduct business transactions
using high-speed connection to the Internet." [17] M-commerce
is gradually becoming a leading force for doing business and in
society generally. For more than two decades there has been a
persistent “push” for moving forward technologies and a
common “pull” of public demand for low-cost, high-speed and
cost-effective communications and for an omnipresent access
to information on a “follow me anytime/anywhere” basis that
has transformed the telecommunications industry.
Consequently, Internet access and high computing capacity of
wireless devices has heralded the induction of new broadband
interactive multimedia applications. Apart from the fact that the
wireless web market is still in its infancy stage, M-commerce is
likely to evolve dramatically in the coming years due to the
emergence of 4G systems integrating many wireless networks,
for example WBAN, WPAN, WLAN, and WMAN. [18]
The developments in M-commerce applications are
relatively more complicated than those concerning e-commerce
and therefore require specialized knowledge. Regarding the
present state of technology all technological requirements such
as high-speed access and low power devices plus business
requirements cannot be achieved all at once, because there are
interests in the value chain that are clearly in conflict with each
other. Amongst those M-commerce applications which are
considered highly personalized, context aware and location
sensitive the most inspiring of them all include digital cash (for
micro payments), human-to-machine communications (from
still to moving objects for access, safety, asset and logistics
using RFID).
A. Mobile banking services
The broad dispersal of personal mobile phones in general
and dependability on mobile communication technologies in
particular have made mobile solutions suitable for an array of
financial services including mobile banking and other
micropayment solutions. Mobile banking services have won
the confidence of their users because there is an absence of
time and place restrictions as well as the need to make a
physical effort. [2] In Australia, lawmaking and enforcement
regimes are working at both federal and state levels to control
and regulate mobile commerce.  Different regulatory bodies
have also been set up especially for the banking, credit and
telecommunications industries. [17]
Banking services make it possible for users to retrieve
information on their account balances using SMS. However,
the new wireless devices using GPRS applications can now
support many banking services, for instance transfer of funds
between accounts, stock trading, and can verify direct
payments through a phone’s micro browser. Characteristically,
mobile banking services are the modified edition of Internet
banking services offered by each respective bank which are
designed and financed by a banking industry syndicate, for
instance Mobey forum and ECBS, etc. Now WAP replace
GPRS, people can pay their utility bills, to do shopping and
connect to solo market where pay can be made using WAP
services. For secure business transaction user can change their
passwords and WTLS. [2]
Mobile networks are being upgraded with WAP, GPRS and
UMTS applications and other enabling technologies to deliver
next-generation multimedia services. Consequently, customers
are now able to check their account statements, transfer of
funds, and they are also notified of larger payments. Generally,
they have immediate and full control over their online finances.
The next generation of mobile banking services will improve
their user-friendly image including motivated instructions,
direct access, safety issues and immediate transaction
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,

processing with minimum costs. The banks will receive more
customer confidence and increased dependability by providing
them with a secure form of instant banking. Customers will
have less low administrative costs, facing no branch
restrictions, and modernized call centers with lower handling
charges. [8]
B. Other financial services ranging from macro to micro
payments
One M-commerce application that is likely to emerge
concerns mobile payments and how they can be further
classified into macro and micro payments. [2] Macro-payments
is of $10 whereas; micro-payments is of $10 or less. One major
distinction is that for macro-payments, confirmation is required
through a trusted financial organization that has to be
performed over unrestricted wireless and/or wired-line backed
networks besides invoking all defensive and safety measures.
In contrast, micro-payments are utilized through an operator’s
communications systems or entail a cash card in addition to
(user’s ID card that stores the classified information such as a
user’s covert confirmation key) for making instant payments
over short distances using Bluetooth, Infra-Red, RFID, and
UWB technologies, etc. [18] Mobile macro payments are done
for bigger purchases either electronically (including e
commerce, mobile ticketing, gaming, etc) or on manned and
unmanned POS (i.e. restaurant bills, retail shopping, etc.). On a
related note macro payments are facing staunch opposition
from conventional payment instruments. Nonetheless, solutions
have been developed for user confirmation while making
macro payments which provide opportunities for many
different services including but not limited to passage control,
digital signatures, etc. [2]
The success stories in Europe and Japan as to the sale of
wireless services and related products indicate that consumer
becoming acclimatized to making small values purchases of
digital content. In this context Apple’s decision to offer 99¢
MP3 downloads back in 2003 would have been signaled the
beginning of a new epoch for micro payments. It can be
envisaged that in the future micro payment providers will be
confronted by mobile payment systems that have some intrinsic
advantages that can persuade them to keep their transactional
costs low. Whether any micro payment provider can achieve
this critical mass or whether micro payments system is ready
for takeoff is debatable. [2]
C. Security mobile phones in the usage in business
It has been resolved that the mobile handheld devices are
productivity enhancing tools and bring many benefits for the
enterprise but at the same time they are also devoid of many
risks for organization’s security as a considerable amount of
confidential corporate and personal data can amass on a
wireless handheld device having enough potential to seek the
interest of an attacker. The more the capabilities and
functionalities of these devices increase, the more the
associated risks increase. [9] Another security risk that is very
common with wireless devices is that it provides a favorable
setting for unauthorized users since it is rather difficult to track
the users having no fixed geographic position hence, they can
go online and offline with a practiced ease. Because of their
small sizes one more risk that is very typical with mobile
devices is the risk of loss or theft. Though the accumulated data
on a lost device is proprietary in nature and can not be
recovered however, there is a persistent risk that any  malicious
finder of the lost device can hack into the proprietary corporate
systems such as, email servers and file systems and the like. [1]
Today mobile phones have become indispensible for doing
business and to watch consumer activity. They have become
the most cherished communication devices in the modern
world. An enterprise can directly contact peoples lives when it
is equipped with WAP enabled phone applications. Up to now,
SMS services have provided an easiest and simplest way to
communicate one on one basis over a mobile network.
However, the WAP experts predict that mobile handheld
devices will soon to become the universal personal interface to
information as well as services. It is envisaged that WAP
technologies will not only enhance the users interest in
adopting the existing internet applications i.e., electronic
banking but will also let those innovative mobile technologies
to control their additional dimensions. Nevertheless, it is
important to be familiar with the initial implementations of
mobile Internet access which will not be the same with which
most of users are familiar. Mobile screen do not have colours it
has just tiny graphics capability, but this is not an issue because
mobile screen has coloured graphics built in video cameras.
GPRS technology will be crucial for enabling the users to stay
online via high speed data transferring Technology, without
plunging into the formalities of dialing up. To cote Jeff Bezos,
the chief executive and founder of Amazon.com supporting m
commerce, “If you look five to ten years out, almost all of e
commerce will be on wireless devices.” [8]
D. Probable and persistent threats, theft and loss of data due
to asynchronization.
Being tiny in size and portable “anywhere anytime”, mobile
handheld devices are regularly lost or misplaced or stolen.
Unless the proper measures are taken, gaining access to the
missing and/or gone data will be too difficult to do, making it
difficult to save and access classified data. Today, software has
been developed and installed in almost all modern handheld
devices besides the above-mentioned data collection websites,
to recover the removed data from flash memory
synchronization. Generally, manual resetting of mobile devices
is used to clean up data and restore its original settings before
selling it. From a rational viewpoint it appears as if the cleaned
up data has completely vanished but it has actually been
preserved somewhere in the device and marked as unused
space. Alternatively, a way to evaluate the risks associated with
handheld devices is to compare them to desktop computers.
The risk profile of handheld devices is incomparable to that of
desktop computers. Nevertheless, the supplementary threats
follow from two main sources: firstly, size and portability; and
secondly, accessible wireless interfaces and associated services.
[9]
Organizations will have to put a ceiling on the access to
information resident on a mobile device. This will mean
frustrating unauthorized access to data by erasing or encrypting
the same data on the device. Or it may be necessary to issue a
command from a long distance. On the other hand encryption
and data wipe solutions are the best safeguards against data
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013

being lost or stolen from the mobile. [14] On a related note
phone flasher units have been designed to rewrite and restore
the memory of different types of cell phones and can easily be
purchased online, etc. [9]
One more step in preserving precious data placed on a
handheld device is to back up the contents on a regular basis.
For instance, data can be synched and/or linked to a desktop
computer as a principal means for having backup data. Backing
up is only effective if the memory card is kept away from the
device. Both device and card can be lost or stolen
simultaneously, severely compromising the benefits of such
data protection. [9]
E. Unauthorized access to e-mail content by vicious hackers
Access to the device and its contents have not escaped the
clutches of malicious hackers through forgery and speculating
the verification of a user’s identification such as PIN or
password and/or by bypassing the whole verification system. It
appears that a good number of cell/mobile phones and PDA
users seldom utilize appropriate security mechanisms built-in
to their devices, and if they do so they usually inadvertently
apply those settings that can be easily bypassed and/or invaded.
Having some inherent vulnerability, cell phones are prey to
malicious hackers if they are not properly secured. [9] In
wireless networks before an attacker attempts to track a target,
targets can very simply come into an attacker’s proximity.
Wireless devices pass through many different and practically
unreliable networks from which service is derived and data can
be swapped over. Consequently the information can be stolen
or corrupted without the user knowing how or when it was
done. Quite often a service may be interrupted and
subsequently disengaged. Similarly, communication can
become sporadic and then restored on a regular basis without
having regard to re-authenticating principles. However, a
simple attempt at “revitalizing” the browser to reinstate
connection may accidentally invite some risks. [1]
Malicious hackers can find the middle ground wireless
connections. An example refers to airline passengers who
randomly check their stock portfolios at departure lounges and
do business from their mobile phones and a malicious hacker
creeps into their favorite financial online site by using a DNS
system that drags information to the malicious hacker’s site. [1]
On a related note “Blue jacking” as suggested by the name is a
method of attacking Bluetooth-enabled mobile devices. “Blue
jacking” begins when an attacker hijacks users’ Bluetooth
enabled devices by sending spontaneous messages which are
subsequently used to persuade the user to act in response in
some manner and the new contact is added to the device’s
address book. These messages cause harm when a user
responds to “blue jacking” that is sent with a harmful intent.
[13]
“Blue bugging” on the other hand, utilizes a security error
in the firmware of some older Bluetooth devices to obtain
access to the device and its commands. This attack uses the
instruction without informing the user, and permitted the
attacker to access data. [13] In 2004, Nicholas Tombros
pleaded guilty to obtaining unauthorized access to wireless
computer networks in order to send spam emails advertising
pornographic websites using his laptop connected to insecure
wireless access points. This was the first case that was
prosecuted under the US CAN-SPAM Act 2003. In light of the
above, mobile and wireless security needs to be addressed by
users and technical experts as well as law enforcement agencies
in order to control or suppress criminal misuse. law
enforcement agencies need to be well aware of the ways in
which criminals have begun to take advantage of the
vulnerabilities of these new forms of information and
communication technologies, for example in the case of
“Wikkileaks” and ‘Julian Assange’s “anti-spam and
defamation” charges. [15]
F. The factors that drive mobile hacking
Mobile phone hacking is done for reasons of economic
gains and viruses allow a burglar to access passwords and/or
corporate data amassed on cell phones. Invaders can maneuver
from a victim’s phone for making calls or send messages and
this offense is commonly dubbed “theft of service”. As the
users of mobile devices are now making macro and micro
payments and conducting other financial transactions over their
cell phones, these devices are becoming an easy prey to
attackers.
Business and finance experts have predicted that such an
activity will boom in the next few years. Presently, mobile
phone users store their credit cards and other financial
information for making electronic transactions by using
electronic wallet software. Mobile devices are becoming likely
targets due to their extensive use, given that there are millions
of prospective targets. They possess several vulnerabilities such
as not being well equipped with antivirus software.  Another
pitfall is that mobile devices compared to desktop computers
are more exposed to the outer world and hence face the perils
of hacking. Since mobile devices are primarily built to make
communication as easy as possible on an “anywhere anytime”
basis therefore, “phone users want to communicate, and viruses
want to be communicated.” [4]
The entire mobile banking system needs to be evaluated
because threats like spoofing, tampering, denial of service,
information disclosure, disclaimer and elevation of advantages
and the like are occurring on mobile phone banking systems. In
order to protect the sensitive data that resides on the phone
device it has become vitally important that such sensitive data
is encrypted during data communication and when the same is
stored on the phone and/or kept in external memory cards. In
the United States of America the instances of stealing credit
card records by hacking through a wireless connection started
appearing in 2003.
The three suspects of this conspiracy allegedly used a
laptop that hacked into the “Michigan Lowes Store’s” wireless
network in the early morning from a car parked outside the
building, gaining access to the company’s central data centre in
the North Carolina and seven other Lowes Stores across the
country. They intended to install a data capturing program used
to process credit card transactions, thus enabling them to steal
credit card details. In 2004, one of the three suspects was
sentenced to nine years imprisonment whilst, his collaborator
was awarded 26 months of imprisonment in addition to two
years of court administered release. [15]

G. Onslaughts on SMS, MMS and emails
A modified version of pagers’ SMS services does the same
job as mobile phones GSM- and CDMA-based technologies to
send concise text messages to mobile phones having little data
storage capacity. They are not considered a useful means for
spreading mobile viruses but they do allow an influx of
damage-causing viruses when a massive amount of SMS traffic
flows between different wireless devices. MMS is a highly
developed form of SMS for those cell phones that are properly
equipped with GPRS-based technologies and can carry up to 50
Kbits of data which is enough for many viruses. Today, most
cell phones can run e-mail applications. However, it would be
somewhat difficult for a virus author not to write mobile
malware application using e-mail attachments to pass on to
wireless devices as happens in case of desktop computers. The
damage in that way would not be as widespread in that unlike
SMS and MMS, most people do not use their cell phones to
read e-mails. [4] By and large, users deem it appropriate to
install antivirus software in their computers yet these
precautionary measures are still not prevalent in the cellular or
mobile phone setting. Since most cell phone users are not
aware of the prospective mobile malicious code they are not
prepared to protect their phones from any attacks. Some mobile
companies have started to install antivirus software in their
phone sets such as Japan’s NTT DoCoMo via the new
Symbian-based FOMA 901i phones with McAfee’s VirusScan
technology. Nokia has launched two phones having a Symantec
Client Security software preloaded onto the memory card and
can be subsequently upgraded via its Symantec LiveUpdate
system. [4]
Mobile wireless devices have a larger attack facade
including but not limited to Bluetooth connectivity, Wi-Fi, and
supplementary cellular communications interfaces and
furthermore protocols for web transactions, electronic mail e
mails), instantaneous messaging (chat messaging) and SMS,
EMS, and MMS messaging. Conversely, the cellular channel
encryption that ends at the radio interface is not sufficient to
systematize the back-to-back privacy requirements of an
organization which requires application-level encryption to be
used over the network in future. [9]
The risks involved in using mobile wireless devices may
include:
 Wireless devices are vulnerable to attack from a virus
emerging from SMS trafficking, Bluetooth connectivity
and\or PCs. For instance, a security vendor company
“SimWorks International” recently identified that the
first Symbian virus is dispersed through MMS
messages.
 Frequent file conversion using Bluetooth connectivity
between mobile devices and PCs has made malicious
code occurrence more manageable, but made data theft
or device damage more likely.
 Spam messages - whether they are done for the purpose
of marketing and/or fraud - are considered to be the
biggest carriers of a virus.
 There is an inherent risk in eavesdropped or accessed by
unscrupulous users. Some users store personal data in
their devices. Sometimes people reveal sensitive
information on mobile communication. [16]
Some recent empirical studies have indicated that ‘Trojans’
and not worms or viruses are the main enemy. ‘Trojans’
technically speaking do not need any transmission vector and
purely depend on the user’s inquisitiveness to download them
onto their wireless devices. ‘Trojans’ camouflage themselves as
utility programs and/or popular games and consequently users
install such programs without knowing what they are; a
spyware capable of recording their incoming and outgoing
SMS messages and also snooping on their dialed numbers and
received calls. Another ‘Trojan’ using malware (like PbStealer)
can filch sensitive and classified data like the user’s PIN from a
user’s cell phone. Such an attack has to be taken seriously
bearing in mind the fact that there are some J2ME based
schemes that can store sensitive data, i.e. a user’s private key
that is persistently stored or retained, etc. ‘Trojans’ are a big
risk regarding the security of the m-payments system in that
these transactions need an authentication through SMS
messages. The huge potential for SMS fraud for the purpose of
financial gain is obvious. [6]
H. Electronic eavesdropping, voice mail recordings and voice
messaging hacking.
Most cells phone users feel comfortable if their phones
cannot be eavesdropped some unscrupulous listeners.
Likewise, any such endeavors to access and overhear from the
air is yet another probable risk that needs to be avoided. The
problem of ‘electronic eavesdropping’ occurs by installing spy
software onto a device for collecting discreet information via
another phone and/or server. This sort of application exists in
some specific phone models and is frequently advertised as a
means to check on the activities of a spouse or children. The
most important feature is their capacity to distantly switch on
the microphone and listen to and/or record conversations. Cell
phones having certain vulnerabilities can consent to the spy
software being subjected to such active communications
interfaces e. organizing a Notebook computer at a legitimate
access point in a busy public spot can permit data to be stolen
from unsuspecting customers. [9]
Since the communications between a handset device and
cell tower are cautiously designed with safety and privacy
issues they will be exploited by wily attackers. Scientists and
researchers in Israel and the USA have explored effective ways
to break the encoding/programming system for GSM-enabled
cell phone networks to facilitate eavesdropping. With reference
to the networking structure, a more focused yet targeted
approach is that while having conversations with their
subscribers, cell phones can be secretly personalized to allow
eavesdropping by networking companies. [9] Some social
aspects of eavesdropping also persist and this has led to the
advent of ‘Flexispy’ spyware to assist people probe possibly
cheating partners.  This application can be used and applied by
distantly activating the device’s microphone to overhear
something. As the capabilities of ‘Flexispy’ are mostly being
employed to monitor the activities of spouses and unruly
children yet the same also has the potential to be used in the
corporate world to keep a check on the activities of the
workforce. Sometimes ‘Flexispy’ spyware logs information
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
24 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
from the device to a central server without the owner’s prior
knowledge. Once the software is installed, a hacker can read
private messages, examine logs from any computer connected
through the Internet and may also overhear confidential
conversations and thus compromise intellectual property rights,
etc. [14]
Specific utility programs exist to record the voice data of
the calls made by the user. With little modification a hacker
very cunningly convert it into a voice recording spyware. The
same can be combined with another Trojan such as PbStealer
to send the recorded data via Bluetooth. This malware can
obstruct the working of some security schemes that use voice
recognition apparatus for verification, as the hacker may replay
the message recorded with the help of this spyware. The above
mentioned attacks have to be taken seriously as the recent case
involving mobile phone hacking by the News of the World
newspaper testifies. [6]
I. Unwanted spam and instance of malware
Of all the transmission channels, communications networks
are the simplest way to transport viruses and other forms of
malware to handheld mobile devices. There are many instances
of infiltrating malware into wireless devices. For example they
can be received while being synchronized with desktop
computers and through infected storage media. Malware can
also be spread in a number of ways, including but limited to:
 Internet Downloads – A user may be at a risk of
downloading any corrupted file. As a camouflage tactic
the file can either be a game, security patch, utility
program or any other useful application posted from
somewhere as a free download. Downloading of
legitimate content can also create problems if they
possess intrinsic vulnerabilities that malware can
exploit.
 Messaging Services – Generally, malware tainted
attachments may be affixed to electronic mail (e-mails)
and MMS messages that are transported to a cell phone
device. Instant Messaging (IM) services that engage
many phones are yet another means to transfer malware.
The users have to make a choice to open the attachment
and subsequently install the same to invite malware to
corrupt the device.
 Bluetooth Communications – Bluetooth connectivity
is the most convenient method to hook up devices for
sending messages or reshuffling files between them.
However, the communications via a Bluetooth device
may be positioned in various forms: it becomes
discoverable whenever it lets a device be noticed by
another Bluetooth-enabled device; and it becomes
connectable whenever it permits the device to respond
to messages retrieved from connected devices until
finally switched off. [9]
Mobile phones are exposed to unwanted SMS text
messages, e-mail and/or voice messages from advertisers.  No
matter what sort of inconvenience their removal may cause,
however, charges may apply for any interconnected events.
For example, a per-message tax is levied on each SMS
message received and/or a further charge is levied for those
messages above the outer monthly limit of a service package.
On the other hand, downloading of data may cost extra charges
if the attachment has visual images, which means that the
charges will remain high. Mobile spam has a tendency to be
used fraudulently and the aim is to convince users to make a
call or send text messages to taxable service numbers by
adopting a modus operandi based on the concept of social
engineering. Conversely, spam may also be used to convince
users to disclose their private and confidential data such as
passwords, financial details or other sensitive data via web
pages, e-mail, or text messages, or to download malware
attached to the message or through a web page. Thus spam and
fraud complement each other. As stated above that Instant
Messaging (IM) and multimedia messages (MMS) are the most
convenient method for spreading malware through spamming.
Denial of service is also considered to be yet another leeway
using spam techniques. [9]
By utilizing the foregoing delivery methods the user
generally has to give approval for the malware to be installed
and properly executed. An array of malware behaviors and
their following consequences are quite extensive. Thus,
malware can possibly overhear user input or otherwise filch
sensitive information, tear down stored information and
subsequently halt a device from working properly. Some
malware can also pull together wireless communications fees
against a subscriber, i.e. by sending SMS messages or making
calls to chargeable tax numbers. The proliferation onto other
handheld devices or even with PCs can also be done by
malware and virtually compromise the entire communications
network. Below are some distinct yet importantly identified
malware categories:
 Spoofing – Malware provides spurious information to
the user to activate an action in the name of security.
 Data Interruption – Malware that resides on the
device’s applications is susceptible to interruption or
access data residing on the phone’s memory,
respectively.
 Data stealing – Occupant malware on the device is able
to collect and send data out of the device.
 Backdoor – Malware resident on the device is able to
put forward deliberations to improve functionality that
lets an attacker gain access.
 Abuse of Service – Occupant malware can execute
those functions which can cause higher than expected
service provider costs for the user and thus cause
embarrassing financial losses.
 Accessibility – Malware resident on the device impacts
on the availability or reliability of either the device or
the data in it.
 Network Access – Malware resident on the device uses
the device for more than one unlawful and unauthorized
network activity such as port scanning or using the
device as a substitute for network communications.
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
25 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
 Wormable – Occupant malware uses available
technologies to publicize itself in a semi-autonomous
manner. [9]
One virus (Commwarrior-B) has appeared on Symbian
Series 60 phones and it spreads via MMS message attachments
and/or Bluetooth. MMS recipients were asked whether or not
they wanted to open the attachment, while Bluetooth recipients
were asked if they wanted to accept the file and subsequently
run it. The moment the virus is installed it starts finding other
Bluetooth-enabled devices to infect. These viruses illustrate
that the ways of imitation are many. A classic Trojan (Brador)
sends the invaders an email message that contains the IP
address of the device as a warning that the backdoor on the
tainted device is now activated. The invaders in this way can
connect to the device, view and download files or even upload
new malicious codes. [9]
J. Electronic tracking
Some cellular carrier companies have acquired the expertise
to track a device’s location through the development of
‘location tracking services’ for registered cell phone users.
These allow users and their friends and family to be connected
with each other 24 hours a day. As for the organizations these
services are also made public to keep an eye on their
employees’ whereabouts and hence improve productivity.
Before the tracking service is activated some carrier companies
issue a warning for the user that they are about to commence
the monitoring, while giving the user an option that he/she may
conclude the service if deemed appropriate. Nevertheless other
service providers issue no such warnings of monitoring to their
customers, if the process of registration is completed. On the
technical side radio isolation bags containing metallic fibers
create a ‘Faraday cage’ that frustrates radio frequencies and
prevent tracking. However, they make normal use of cell or
mobile phones impossible and the battery to deplete quickly.
[9]
Of the many security-related technologies being used,
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) can spot objects and
users; locations. It is very likely to become an important and
core technology in today’s global mobile communication
systems. This technology has particularly proved useful for
organizations that have many functions such as retail, supplies,
accounts, design, etc. [11] Tracking services have their own
vulnerabilities such as the possibility of clandestinely
registering someone else’s phone for monitoring purposes. For
instance, if the system contemplates completing the registration
process in that case a phone will require a sign of
authentication. In other words, an SMS must reply with an
authenticator code, but uses a code value that is not distinctive.
One more approach that can also be utilized includes and is not
limited to an online SMS access to engineer the response
required to complete registration, etc. [9]
IV. IS INCREASED USE OF MOBILE PHONES IN
WORKPLACES RAISING PRODUCTIVITY ISSUES?
A statistical survey on the use of mobile phones in the
workplace indicated that by the end of 2010 the number of
people using such phones was 850 to 1000 million and rising.
An estimated speedy growth of smartphones and their bulk
consignments on a yearly basis now that they are being used
more than ever by employees are the key factors which are
forcing businesses to ponder their impact on organizational
security. The increasing demand of mobile phones in the
workplace is creating productivity concerns because the
increased functionalities of these phones are being shadowed
by more risk factors. Other empirical surveys have shown that
the smartphone market will surpass the laptop market within a
couple of years; the global shipments of smartphones will
double at the rate of 30% compound annual growth within the
next two years. From employees’ perspectives the use of
smartphones and PDAs will enable major business transactions
to be done on a “follow me anytime/anywhere” basis without
the need for desktop computers. From the business point of
view besides voice telephony, employees can use these
wireless handheld devices for the following functions including
but not limited to:
 Send and retrieve e-mails where a transaction needs a
prompt response,
 Send and receive instant messages (IM) for a quick
chat,
 Use vertical applications for administration and
business strategies such as Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP), Customer Resource Management
(CRM) and Sales Force Automation (SFA),
 Scan barcodes for prices of goods using high definition
smartphones like iPhone, etc.,
 Browse web pages,
 Download and share files on the Internet and via
Bluetooth connectivity,
 Use Personal Information Management (PIM) for
keeping records of phone book contact information to
prepare agenda items and convene meetings,
 Store confidential personal and corporate data, etc. [13]
It is important to state here that many companies have
started to value access to the above business applications on
mobile handheld devices, namely: Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
and/or Sales Force Automation (SFA). These applications
invariably contain some classified and sensitive data that will
not only be useful for customer dealings but can improve the
worth of their future business operations. Consequently, such
mobile applications have transformed the purpose and meaning
of PDAs and mobile devices which are no longer an optional
gadget but a much needed business tool. [13] All of the above
mentioned functionalities mobile handheld devices meet the
criteria of being the most effective method to raise the
workforce’s efficiency as well as improve an enterprise’s
security and privacy risks. [13]
Mobile devices also have certain drawbacks such as any
violation of safety setting on the device can be expensive for
the organization. The increased number of mobile phone users
and global Internet connectivity has diminished the prospects
of the conservative “fixed” boundaries for organizations since a
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
26 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
network protected by a central firewall is no longer enough for
today’s hi-tech lifestyle. [13] Users frequently move beyond
these boundaries are they have become more susceptible to
data theft and similar threats. Moreover mobile devices are also
more vulnerable to carrying viruses, spam and other malware,
which can be released through the network when the user is
connected behind the network firewall. Portability of these
compact tiny devices is yet another drawback attributed to
these devices as they can be lost or stolen very easily,
compromising the data accessed or stored on them. Major
security risks due to mobile devices can hamper productivity
and create hazards for a business; this generates the following
problem scenarios:
 loss of a company’s classified and sensitive data and
intellectual property (IP) due to theft or loss of mobile
devices,
 loss of employee productivity due to malware and
malicious codes,
 loss of intellectual property due to spyware,
 fraud and lost productivity due to hacking, etc. [13]
A. Theft or loss of mobiles may endanger a company’s
confidentiality policies
Statistics show that on a yearly basis hundreds and
thousands of cell phones and PDAs are stolen and/or
misplaced. [9] However, the worth and price of the hardware
and software of a lost device becomes unimportant and
irrelevant compared to the worth and price of the data residing
on the device. Lost data always remains susceptible to tainted
reputations, cut-throat business strategies and possible legal
action, etc. People - whether they are general customers,
patients, investors, entrepreneurs and business people - put
their trust in those companies managing their private and
sensitive information. In this context some national
governments have developed specific legislation, amendments
and/or regulations requiring those companies to protect and
administer data from any leaks. [13]
The Australian government has enacted various laws and
regulations to cope with different types of content, including
personal information. At the federal level the most important
statute is the “Privacy Act 1988” which protects personal
information and how it is handled by private sector
organizations and government agencies. The Act also has
relevance to how consumers who use m-commerce services
may have their personal information and private details
collected and used, particularly by advertisers and service
providers including telecommunication operators which
already handle a huge amount of private information regarding
subscribers to mobile phone services. An individual's privacy
rights have also been described in the form of Ten National
Privacy Principles (NPPs) which define the parameters of such
organizations while collecting, storing, using, disclosing,
protecting and transferring customers’ personal information,
etc. In the case of contravening any of the provisions of the
said law(s) for releasing any private and corporate information
severe penalties can be imposed. [17]
Organizations should take precautionary measures to
protect their valuable data by restricting any unauthorized
access to the data stored on a device in case the device is
misplaced and/or stolen. In this case encryption and data
restoration policies or data wipe-off solutions may provide the
best defense. Only data-driven policies cannot completely
eradicate all types of risks pertaining to mobile theft or loss of
data; it can only persuade employees and managers to remain
vigilant in minimizing the risk of data leakage and compliance
violations that may hamper a company’s reputation. [13] A
study conducted by the Readers Digest organization in 2007
suggested that in many of the world’s largest cities an
estimated 32% of lost phones are never recovered.  A cell
phone following its reactivation could be used arbitrarily to
make international calls that the original subscriber must pay
for. If the lost device is able to be restored to its original
settings manually or and is reused easily, the contents of the
user’s data may be expunged. [9]
B. Threats posed by malware may hamper employee
productivity
It has become abundantly clear that today’s viruses and
worms are a routine hazard for desktop computers, but the
increasing demand and functionalities of hi-definition
smartphone mobile devices makes them an attractive target for
malware writers. There is every likelihood that the infiltration
of malware on mobile devices can increase business and safety
concerns. One major attack relating to mobile handheld devices
appeared in 2000 and from then on viruses and malware have
threatened the most popular mobile operating systems such as
Symbian OS, and Windows Mobile3, etc. The built-in email
and text messaging faculty of smartphones has made them an
easy prey to viruses, as improved functionalities simply
increases the risks. Malware can easily be disseminated via
built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity through peer-to-peer
communication for mobile devices. The viruses can influence a
mobile phone’s built-in messaging facility and PIM data so that
it is sent to other mobile phones. [13]
Some viruses infect other devices that sustain MMS text
messaging service if they act in response to the retrieved
messages, like the infamous Mabir virus. Offenses like fraud
and economic loss are also associated with mobile malware.
Mobile malware can disturb the whole Symbian OS system by
sending premium-rated messages of which the user has no
knowledge. Futuristic mobile spyware may use such unlawful
methods that were once considered the domain of desktop
computers. For instance, SMS spam disseminates through junk
text messages and can reveal users’ confidential and private
data through SMS-based phishing attacks which at times is
known as “smishing.” [13]
Wireless handheld devices have a tendency to create a
security gap in an organization’s security firewall. It has been
observed that employees who carry their own devices
(employee owned equipment) will definitely try to synchronize
them with their office terminal (organization-issued equipment)
and/or use their own devices to get connected to the terminal’s
Internet. [9] Many employees would like to improve their
productivity by synchronizing their mobile handheld devices to
their laptops. Organizations have to protect their mobile
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
27 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
devices in the same way as they protect desktops and laptops.
Since mobile handheld devices operate from networks outside
the controlled boundaries of an enterprise they can obtain
access to the organization’s network which causes the whole
IT-based system to become infected. Such devices need to
install anti-malware software to curb  the risk of infection,
which are not limited to Viruses, Trojans, Spyware, etc. The
persistent danger remains that once malware gets installed on a
device the same can not only steal the private and sensitive data
residing on the device but may reduce productivity levels and
escalate expenses for organizations. [13]
C. Economic issues: customer receipts, taxation and running
costs
For organizations it is important to know what kind and
model of devices are being used that can maintain their security
policy and improve productivity without putting an
unnecessary burden on their economic policies.  [13] An
omission in checking mobile handheld devices can cause
financial losses so care must be taken when managing credit
cards, which remain under the holders’ control. If an
organization’s mobile phone is lent to a non-related person it is
at risk of misuse and activation of malware and unwanted
services such as mobile tracking, etc. Organizations may have
to pay huge expenses regarding toll calls and if confidential
data is misplaced. Tax laws in a number of countries have
provided with a limited number of the services offered by
mobile companies free of charge up to which a tax or surcharge
is levied on each and every transaction hence, an
organizational-issued mobile if becomes a prey of the clutches
of an unscrupulous user may incur heavy losses to the
organizations’ reserves, etc.  [9]
It is always best not to keep any confidential information on
a mobile handheld device such as financial accounts.
Verification mechanism can be thwarted by hackers and
therefore any sort of authenticating data such as PINs,
passwords, user IDs, and financial details should not be placed
on a device’s memory. If so such sensitive data should be
retained only in an encrypted form. Most of today’s
smartphone devices like Symbian and iPhon support built-in
encryption capabilities by providing a “wallet” that stores
personal information when needed. Nevertheless, where the
device is an organization-issued device then the aforesaid
should comply with the company’s policies. [9] Large
organizations are also endorsing new productivity enhancing
policies which have proven to be commercially viable and cost
effective. For instance, in some countries international food
chain companies and sky shoppers have provided their
employees with printer applications attached to their handheld
mobile phone devices, particularly those associated with supply
and delivery departments that issue billing receipts to
customers to keep financial records. This is financially
beneficial to companies so that they can check any billing
irregularities. However, this practice is not suitable for smaller
organizations such as Third World enterprises which cannot
afford such expensive devices supported by a whole integrated
workstation system. [9]
It is abundantly clear how mobile handheld devices are
becoming indispensable for today’s organizations to improve
productivity. However, their global acceptance is only
happening gradually because they are not integral to all aspects
of organizational infrastructure. One core issue which is being
faced by the organizations is how to differentiate between the
“employee-owned equipment” versus “organization-issued
equipment”. At the outset, it seems practically workable to let
“employee-owned” cell phones and PDAs to be used for
business purposes in a cost-effective way. Nevertheless, it is
difficult to develop the capabilities to control and handle these
devices. More importantly, security concerns for cell phone
handheld devices range from those that are commonly linked to
computer equipment because they operate from platforms
outside the restricted boundaries of “fixed” devices.
Furthermore, a number of safeguards are invariably available
for desktop and networked workstations but are not commonly
available for a wide range of handheld devices. On the other
hand “organization-issued devices” can be administered as the
basic functionalities of these devices are known, their
configurations can be sporadically managed in accordance with
company policy. It is therefore suggested that the said
functionalities can let organizational applications particularly
those developed for PCs be more easily extended to the mobile
platform. [9]
D. Fraud and lost productivity are likely hacking targets
Malware, Spam, Trojan as well as unwanted content are
considered harmful for mobile security systems and susceptible
to being attacked through hacking and/or denial of service, etc.
Viruses take advantage of the limitations and vulnerabilities of
mobile phone operating systems before initiating any attacks.
For instance, one known malware called “Skulls” attacks all
links on a mobile handheld device by neutralizing its
applications. Consequently, if a device becomes infected with
this kind of malware, the user cannot send any e-mails or
instant messages; in fact all symbols on the phone device are
replaced with the skull image of the “Skulls” virus. These
threats can be alleviated by adopting and implementing
industry best practices. IT administrators in large organizations
can recommend integrated practices for protecting mobile
devices from any sort of security-related risks. Advances in
technology have led to improvements in security which is a
three-fold system in that it involves people, events and blue
chip technology. All these elements need to be considered to
create the best security system possible. Some of the prevailing
policies have been discussed very briefly in the above sections
but in a different context. [13]
The focal point of these integrated best practice policies
should be how to protect handheld device from unscrupulous
users and for this purpose Password protection is considered to
be the most effective barrier to protect data intrusion. All
mobile devices must have a power-on-password enabled
facility so that phone users can be identified with their
respective device. Nevertheless, a vigorous mobile security
plan would empower administrators to execute reliable and
integrated policies for all devices from a single location. For
instance administrators are required to be proficient in
preventing all brute force log-on attempts, i.e. multiple
attempts with different login/password combinations and the
like. [13] On the other hand, encryption is still considered to be
the first line of defense against any invasion of a phone to
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
28 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
prevent loss of data or theft. It is also important to protect data
in transit (travelling data e-mails, etc.) during “device to
server” transmission. There are some security protocols which
help ensure that data is properly and safely transmitted. Of
these, the “SSL” protocol protects data in transit because it is
very economical and simple to implement and does not need
any new client software on a mobile device. In contrast, VPNs
also secure data in transit but they are expensive, have a
propensity to drain battery life and require a client software.
Administrators should be properly skilled to configure all
forms of data encryption and how to use algorithms. [13]
Anti-malware and anti-spam solutions should be updated on
a regular basis so that new prototypes for notorious malware
can be discovered and dealt with. Moreover, mobile phone data
has to be scanned immediately including data residing on
mobile devices and on external memory cards whenever they
are inserted. If the administrator deems it necessary a manually
scan the devices then this should be done. [9] By and large,
malicious programs can easily be disseminated to cell phones
via communication channels, i.e. MMS or Bluetooth
connections. Whenever, a message or contact is received on a
mobile phone from an unknown number it deserves to be
treated cautiously. Regularly received MMS messages or e
mails even from a familiar number and/or address, containing
an attachment to be installed can become susceptible to a
malicious program. [9] Whenever possible, Bluetooth settings
must be constructed with the utmost security by sending phone
users prior intimations regarding the incoming link requests
and obtain their verifications before they take place. Most of
today’s smart phones offer this service to manage Bluetooth
functionalities by allowing only selective profiles which are
required to support activation with another mobile handheld
device. It has been suggested that device pairing should not be
done at public places, but instead in places that are radio
isolated and/or in Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-free
environments. This will deter the chance of being monitored or
recorded over the air thereby using them to restore protection
keys that may be used while eavesdropping. [9]
V. SAFEGUARDS AND PREVENTIONS
Mobile handheld devices are productivity enhancing tools
even though they do have serious security problems. Yet
organizations are still reluctant to realize their significance as a
vital component of a particular organizational infrastructure.
Without delving into the advantages and disadvantages of
employee-owned tools as well as organization-issued tools, the
“control factor” of these wireless devices is rather difficult to
ascertain as they are not controlled by approved platforms vis
à-vis “fixed devices”. [9]
Since the security concerns pertaining to cell or mobile
phone devices intrinsically vary from those of the desktop
computers, many safeguards which are invariably available for
desktop and other networked computers in the workplace are
not as accessible for all kinds of mobile handheld devices. The
reason behind this is that on the whole organization-issued
devices are much easier to manage because the traits of these
“fixed” devices are already identified; their prototypes can be
easily managed and joysticks can be installed when needed to
enhance the level of security, in conformity with the company’s
policies. However, a workable suggestion would be that the
said attributes of the organizational applications for desktop
computers can be extended to mobile platforms as well. Our
discussion will include an appraisal of the range of safeguards
available for mobile handheld devices, and how they eradicate
the associated risks for the organizations. [9]
A. User-oriented measures for maintaining security
The security of handheld devices cannot be maintained
without users’ involvement. Users must be instructed about
what measures to follow and what precautions to take while
they use organization-issued equipment. For instance,
numerous built-in configuration settings and security
prototypes of handheld devices are seldom used. Taking full
advantage of all the facilities afforded by cell phones or PDAs,
it is vitally important that the user know all the security
safeguards. [9] By and large, user authentication methods are
available on a majority of devices such as PINs and passwords
though they are considered to be the first barrier to any
unscrupulous access, yet have certain pitfalls. For users it is
rather difficult to understand and analyze the plethora of
documents involving all the features and options available on a
handheld device for authentication, as it entails accurate and
secure choices. [9] Users should prevent keeping any sort of
confidential data on a handheld device since the authentication
mechanism is not devoid of certain weaknesses and can easily
be bypassed or wrecked and/or recycled from the deleted data.
Even if confidential data is kept on detachable memory cards, it
should be kept away from the device unless required. When it
becomes imperative to keep the sensitive data on devices, it
should be kept in encrypted form since most of today’s smart
phones do support built-in encryption capabilities to meet this
requirement. [9]
Yet another simple protective measure against various
forms of malware that users can employ is just to simply turn
off Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, infrared, and other wireless interfaces,
unless absolutely needed. This is because Bluetooth devices are
prone to escalating risk factors due to mobile malware,
particularly in crowded surroundings such as airports, sports
events and/or music concerts that proffer a target-enriched
environment. Immobilizing a wireless interface also has the
advantage of extending the battery life of the device. In
addition to the above, automatic connections to cellular data
services, that is, GPRS or EDGE systems, are also better to be
turned off while not being used. Staying offline brings many
fringe benefits as well since it averts the risks posed by
malware infection and it can also thwart an infected device
from sending contaminated data to other parties. If a phone
device automatically connects to data services it can also be a
direct warning that the phone has been infected by malware
and is now attempting to spread itself through various
applications. [9]
In case the device is misplaced or stolen the user can take
precautionary measures even from a distance, such as disabling
service, locking the device and/or completely wiping out its
contents by immediately reporting the incident to the cellular
carrier company. In this regard GSM carriers in many countries
have taken a quantum leap as they can now register the
identifier of the phone, for instance International Mobile
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
29 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
Equipment Identity or (IMEI) in a global database that prevents
it being used elsewhere.  It is, however, important to
understand regarding the whole reporting system prior to the
incident what kind of information is essential. Stolen devices
may accrue substantial charges that the subscriber of the phone
must pay until the device is reported as stolen. A copy of the
filed police report may be required for phone charges to be
dropped. [9]
B. User authentication and physical control on the mobile
device
Of all the available safeguards concerning the security of
mobile handheld devices, users’ authentication techniques are
commonly available in many devices, for example PINs and
passwords. Although these knowledge-based authentication
techniques are not infallible and have certain vulnerabilities,
they are considered to be the first line of defense against
unauthorized users’ access. There are three main categories of
users’ authentication techniques commonly being used for
authentication:
 proof by knowledge ( passwords),
 proof by possession ( tokens, i.e. smart cards),
 proof by property (fingerprints).
The aforementioned techniques can be used either alone or
in tandem with others. However, using more than one type of
authentication technique is also feasible and affords better
protection. Passwords on one hand are believed to be the oldest
and most popular form of proof-by-knowledge technique for
handheld devices. Likewise, smart card authentication is best
known for its proof-by-possession technique. Having
entrenched the computer chip operating system, programs and
data storage systems, these credit card-sized security tokens
have become an integral part of the internal security
infrastructure of some organizations, which are extending the
already installed smart cards to handheld devices. Smart cards
are able to transmit users’ security identification and policy
rules to a device that administers users’ authorization and
permissible behavior. Passwords fingerprints are also
considered to be the oldest proof-by-property technique that
involves the biometric system. This technology is relatively
complex compared to the rest of the above two and therefore, a
small number of mobile handheld devices have built-in
fingerprint-based technology authentication. [9]
The proof by knowledge technique (passwords) can be
divided into two categories, where the former enables users to
choose a series of  displayed images and the latter refers to
sketch a series of lines over a network or follows the icon
pattern. The former, however, is being applied in various
commercial security products for handheld devices. The most
notable development in proof by possession (smart cards)
technique is that now wireless smart cards insert a radio
frequency chip or in a more compatible mode; some
manufacturers have introduced removable media as well. [9]
Organizations must adopt concrete and meticulous policies
regarding passwords and PINs for cell phones and PDAs in a
back-to-back and composite manner. Nevertheless, there
should be restraints on using the same password for a handheld
device which is to be used for network access or access to other
devices and applications. In case the password is erased from
memory, different techniques can be utilized to recover the
same from various handheld devices. This infers collaboration
access to the network or other devices in turn. Various
authentication techniques incorporate a time-out feature that
can automatically lock the device the moment it reaches the
verge of a stipulated condition, such as a screen saver, etc. At
times these techniques can be rather irritating, but they are
meant to help protect a misplaced or stolen device or until the
owner recovers it. [9]
Keeping physical control of a mobile handheld device is
also vitally important. Like all precious possessions these
devices should not be left unattended. The contents and
confidential data that resides on a device’s memory also be
jeopardized if an unauthorized and dishonest user gains access
to it. It is dangerous to let else to use the device as it
inadvertently invites malware and/or activation of unwanted
services, such as mishandling while retrieving messages and/or
taking unwanted calls. Sometimes, even a slight change in the
security settings of the device can expose it to other types of
threats that remain unnoticed because the user does not know
what kind of changes have been made in the security settings.
[9]
C. Minimized functionality of devices and decrease data
exposure
The more the augmented functionalities and innovative
technologies are taking place the more the proportion of risk is
mounting.  To cope with this problem the most viable solution
could be to decrease the number of functionalities offered by
them except those which are particularly needed.
Consequently, one good paradigm for getting the desired
results is to minimize the wireless interfaces unless urgently
required and by rendering all those superfluous features
inoperative through configuration settings. However, in certain
circumstances some features may also be removed permanently
to avoid their involuntary reactivation. Likewise, reducing the
use of attached applications and/or plug-ins may also provide
desired benefits. As these applications do have certain
vulnerabilities, if they are installed they can get into the user’s
content and compromise the programming interfaces of the
device. It is therefore vitally important that prior to the
installation of any such applications their advantages and
disadvantages have been evaluated.  [9]
Cellular service agreements and subsequent service settings
are yet another method to manage or simplify the functionality
issue. If data service is eradicated for the activation of voice
service only the same may avert full access to the Internet,
which is be considered to be an appropriate solution. On the
other hand, it can be possible to have the carrier restrict access
to international destinations which are not being used or
blocking other services. An example concerns various cellular
carriers who offer to block subscribers’ text messages initiated
directly from the Internet because this is a major cause of
disseminating wireless spam. It has been suggested that it is
better not to keep sensitive and private data on mobile devices.
This is because the whole authentication system can be easily
avoided and deleted information may be restored from a
phone’s memory. Regardless of how convenient it is for
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
30 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
subscribers to verify their online financial records and/or to
other devices via PINs, passwords, user IDs, and account
numbers on wireless handheld devices, it should be avoided.
Classified and sensitive data can also be stored on detachable
memory cards but the same should be kept separate from the
device. Moreover, matters pertaining to labeling and tracking
of sensitive data residing on these devices can also divert
attention. [9]
D. Restoration of back-up data and installation of preventive
and detection software
It would be a catastrophe if someone starts using handheld
devices as the sole depository for keeping important
information. The device may be misplaced or stolen or
damaged accidentally. For protecting the precious data residing
on a device it is safer to restore back-up of data on a regular
basis. For this reason, data can either be synchronized with a
desktop computer for keeping a back-up or for any possible
dual purpose. Alternatively, this back-up data can also be kept
on the memory card but the card can only be supportive if it is
kept detached from the handheld device. The chances of
restoration of back-up data will be further narrowed down if
both the device and the card are lost or stolen simultaneously.
[9]
The operating systems and built-in technologies of mobile
handheld devices are far more complex than desktop
computers, and hence warrant extra security controls for the
prevention and detection of attacks against them. In this regard
the installation of “Prevention and Detection” software for
defending and protecting against any kind of malware
onslaught has become indispensable. Consequently, a large
range of such equipment is now available for a number of
today’s handheld devices, especially, for smart phones and
PDAs that may be used to supplement the already existing
built-in security mechanisms in them. It should be mentioned
here that these “add-on” security software systems do have
certain vulnerabilities and they should be evaluated very
carefully. These types of equipment generally contain one or
more of the below mentioned capabilities:
 User authentication alternatives, including biometrics
(proof by property) and token-based (proof by
possession) techniques,
 Content and memory card encryption,
 Firewall and Intrusion detection system,
 Antivirus and antispam (anti-malware),
 Content and memory card erasure (wipe off
technology), and
 Virtual private networking. [9]
Organizations must consider how to protect mobile
handheld devices. Although these wireless handheld devices
are controlled on the networks which are outside the ambit of
organizations’ “fixed” boundaries, when they connect back to
the network they may pollute organizations’ whole IT systems.
Extending equal protection to mobile handheld devices with
those of the desktops and laptops, these devices must have anti
malware software installed on them to reduce or eradicate
infection. Once malware gets into a mobile device it may not
only drain off all private and classified data, but may also
severely compromise productivity levels and augmented
support expenses. Anti-malware software works by finding
solutions to scan all the upcoming mobile threats by not having
them installed on the device. Commercially available software
such as Flexispy has the same application. To be more precise,
the most effective anti-malware and anti-spam solutions should
obtain updates periodically, about all new prototypes for
already identified malware with the lowest amount of users’
and/or administrative intervention. It is suggested that data
residing on a device’s memory has to be scanned
instantaneously, including the data residing on external
memory cards whenever they are inserted. [13]
Mobile handheld devices also require a complete firewall
protection to curb unauthorized access. Firewalls are best
known for their cautious scrutinizing capabilities and once set
in motion, they can restrict mobile traffic. Moreover, private
firewalls are also indispensable for obstructing port scans that
the attackers usually use to discover vulnerabilities when a
device is linked to a public network. Firewalls also supposed to
be the first barrier against any abuse of un-punched security
holes in a device operating system and/or client applications.
Thus, businesses must install a comprehensive firewall and
intrusion detection systems with pre-defined security standards
which can further be modified by the administrators in a
particular workplace environment. An intrusion detection
system (IDS) while implemented on a mobile handheld device
can negate service attacks by identifying the prototypes of
network traffic. On a related note, a better solution is where
administrators are authorized to establish an exemption list to
supersede security level settings or by blocking certain types of
network traffic. For instance, administrators should be
empowered to prohibit certain types of protocols, ports, and IP
addresses from inspection because in a particular
organizational setting users may have different levels of
requirements and usage. The following measures will enhance
the level of mobile security:
 Inspection and access perimeters for devices,
 Firewalls to curtail the type and origin of network
traffic,
 Easy-to-deploy firewall solutions with pre-defined
security levels to be modified by the administrator, and
 Intrusion detection systems to obstruct denial of service
attacks, etc. [13]
E. Solution Methods (I-clouds)
A major global IT problem refers to disk storage and
particularly its operating costs, which have been estimated as
representing nearly 30-50% of gross capital expenditures per
annum in many enterprises. Against this background,
enterprises must manage effectively the costs of storing data,
especially unformed data. Therefore, to address this need,
Cloud storage services have emerged and become fashionable.
[21] Nevertheless, the current economic state of affairs as well
as the advent of new technologies has ignited the interest of
organizations in Cloud storage services and/or provider models.
Cloud storage providers can suggest cost-cutting measures by
(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013
31 | P a g e
www.ijacsa.thesai.org
using equal storage capacity to meet organizations’ needs, such
as transitional cost-savings measures for their customer base.
[21]
Cloud storage services/providers are commonly known as
“Cloud Backup” which makes back-ups of enterprise archives
online automatic, while data is safely stored externally in data
centers and is easily recovered. For example, if an unfortunate
fire incident happens at any workplace or home both computers
and disks (i.e. CD-ROM or tape, etc.) can be damaged. With
Cloud Backup this threat is eradicated. A number of platforms
are being supported by Cloud Backup such as:
 Windows___ Windows Vista, Windows XP, 2000
Professional, Server 2000/2003,
 Linux_____ and its most popular versions RedHat,
SuSE,  Debian, and its supportive system like Ubuntu,
all with Java 1.5 or higher,
 Mac OS X, etc. [19]
Security has been the core issue in the developing phase of
Cloud Backup. Data is first encrypted and condensed and then
it is sent to and stored on a Backup Server in a fully secured
data center. This involves a fully secured (SSL) network
connection that makes the Cloud Backup service as safe as
online banking. Nobody can enter the data stored at data
centers except the subscriber. In other cases, the moment the
data enters into an insecure setting like the Internet, it is
vulnerable to hackers. An answer to this is Cloud Backup
which encodes data (in encrypted form) before it leaves the
terminal and subsequently decodes it while it is restored on a
workstation. [19] This is why security and accessibility issues
come first when companies choose to transfer their sensitive
data to the Cloud Backup system, via the Internet. [21] The
market for Cloud Backup services is rapidly growing owing to
the huge amount of private and corporate data now being
stored on desktop computers and laptops and more recently on
smartphones. Smartphones have the equivalent storage capacity
of their larger counterparts. [20]
VI. CONCLUSIONS
The omnipresent exploitation of mobile systems, extensive
use of the Internet as well as the speedy growth in wireless
technologies and the broadband interactive multimedia
applications in recent years have helped improve the functions
and characteristics of mobile handheld devices. [9] The said
devices and communication systems have also developed
especially built-in software to curb any instances of
encroachment. [18] Though mobile devices can provide many
productivity benefits for organizations and businesses, these
devices are subject to security risks such as malicious codes
and communication attacks, theft of data, spam, etc. [15]
Security concerns become vitally important vis-à-vis financial
transactions so that the assault vectors in this application need
to be examined with due diligence. [6] Therefore, mobile
security must be tackled by both the users and law enforcement
agencies to reduce the risk of criminal misuse. [14] In this
economic environment new technologies have made
organizations very interested in “Cloud Backup” because it
creates automatic back-ups of enterprise archives online, while
data remains safely stored in data centers and can easily be
recovered. [19] Enhanced wireless security and the broad
exploitation of 4G systems in the coming years will enable
mobile commerce to become the best way of doing business.
