Offshoring in the ServiceSector Economic Impact andPolicy IssuesBy C. Alan GarnerThe United States continues to run an international trade surplusin services, but business stories frequently appear about servicesector jobs moving offshore. Many Americans are particularlyconcerned about the loss of skilled, wellpaid jobs in such fields as computer programming and accounting. These jobs seemed relatively secureat a time when many manufacturing jobs were being lost to importcompetition. Similarly, telephone call centers, once viewed as an economic development opportunity in some areas, increasingly are movingto lowwage countries, such as India and the Philippines. Reflecting thisgrowing concern, some members of Congress and state legislators havefocused attention on the offshoring of service jobs and production,even introducing legislation to limit the outsourcing of jobs to othercountries.Offshoring raises many questions for policymakers and the generalpublic. For example, which service jobs will be affected most by importcompetition What are the most likely effects of servicesector offshoring on U.S. output, employment, and, most important, ourC.

The first section summarizes recent trends and theoutlook for servicesector offshoring. The second section explains theeconomic, technological, and regulatory factors driving the process andidentifies characteristics that make a service job susceptible to offshoring. The third section analyzes the effects of offshoring on U.S.output, employment, and standards of living. The fourth section evaluates various policy options for dealing with the economic challengescreated by offshoring. Although the offshoring of service jobs hurtssome workers, offshoring should not permanently lower U.S. employment or production. Moreover, the average living standard can benefitover the long run if the nation adopts policies to retrain displacedworkers and move them into expanding industries.I. RECENT TRENDS AND PROJECTIONSTo judge by the headlines, servicesector jobs have been leaving theUnited States in large numbers. Reliable information on the offshoringof service jobs and production is rather limited, however. This sectionexamines recent evidence on servicesector offshoring as well as projections for the years ahead. Offshoring of service jobs has actually beensmaller than the headlines might suggest, but projections that offshoring will accelerate are plausible, though subject to considerableuncertainty.Trends in offshoringThe term offshoring refers to the relocation of jobs and production to a foreign country. The relocated jobs and production could be ata foreign office of the same multinational company or at a separatecompany located abroad. In contrast, the term outsourcing does notnecessarily imply that jobs and production are relocated to anothercountry. Outsourcing of such jobs as janitorial services and payrollECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 7accounting by manufacturing firms to domestic service companies haslong been an important factor driving the growth of business servicesemployment.The loss of service jobs and production caused by offshoring is difficult to measure. Government statistical agencies provide usefulmeasures of international trade in services, which are described in theaccompanying box, but there is no official measure of service jobsmoved abroad. It is also difficult to determine the impact of offshoringfrom data on total services employment in the United States. Servicesector jobs have taken much longer to rebound from the 2001 recessionthan from previous recessions, a phenomenon that some commentatorshave blamed on offshoring Chart 1. However, servicesector jobs haveheld up much better than manufacturing jobs during the current recovery. Also, while some of the recent softness in servicesector jobs may bedue to offshoring, other factors, such as rapid productivity growth andthe shedding of excess capacity in the telecommunications industry,may have played important roles.1Recent estimates of job losses in the service sector caused by offshoring are small relative to total U.S. employment. For example,McCarthy 2002 estimates that about 103,000 service jobs moved Chart 1JOB SHIFTS CONCENTRATED IN MANUFACTURING1012141618201950 1957 1965 1973 1981 1988 1996 200420406080100120Manufacturingemployment LServicesemployment RNote Shaded areas represent recessions as determined by the National Bureau of Economic Research.Source U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor StatisticsMillions MillionsBox 1INTERNATIONAL TRADE IN SERVICESInternational trade in services covers a wide range of industriesand activities see accompanying charts. Travel and transportationincludes travel expenditures, passenger fares, and other transportation, such as freight and port services. Royalties and license feescover transactions involving patents, copyrights, trademarks, andother intangible proprietary rights to use, produce, or distributeproducts. Other private services include many of the industriesthat first come to mind when thinking of servicesfor example,education, financial services, insurance, telecommunications, andvarious business and professional services. Finally, governmentservices include transfers under U.S. military sales contracts, directdefense expenditures abroad, and miscellaneous governmenttransactions.The United States has historically run surpluses in internationalservices trade. In 2003, the nation ran a deficit of 489 billion intotal goods and services trade but ran a surplus of about 60billion in services alone. Service exports were 305 billion, about30 percent of total U.S. exports, while service imports were 245billion, about 16 percent of total imports.8 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYOther private services 42.7 Royalties and license fees, 15.8Travel and transportation, 37.1Defense and government, 4.4Other private services, 31.2 Defense and government, 10.9Royalties and license fees, 7.8Travel and transportation, 50.0Exports ImportsSource U.S. Department of CommerceCOMPOSITION OF SERVICE EXPORTS AND IMPORTS, 2003Table 1EMPLOYMENT CHANGES IN ATRISK AND LOWRISKSERVICE OCCUPATIONSOccupations Level in 2000 Job loss Percent job lossmillions 20002002 20002002 Atrisk 14,249,730 217,840 1.5Lowrisk 96,441,110 251,670 0.3Notes Atrisk occupations are the same as in Bardhan and Kroll.

This pace of offshoring also equals only 5 percentof the average annual gain in nonfarm payroll employment over the lastten years.3Occupational employment statistics for the United States provideadditional evidence that past servicesector offshoring has been small.About 14 million service jobs were at risk of offshoring in 2000, whileabout 96 million service jobs had a low risk of offshoring Table 1.4The decline in the atrisk service occupations from 2000 to 2002 wasabout 218,000 jobs, or roughly 109,000 jobs annually, a relatively smallnumber that is consistent with the estimates of McCarthy or Zandi. Inpercentage terms, employment in the atrisk occupations fell at a fasterrate from 2000 to 2002 than in the lowrisk occupations. This fasterdecline is consistent with offshoring activity, although the decline isconsistent with other explanations as well, such as a faster pace of technological change in industries employing the atrisk occupations orgreater cyclical sensitivity in these industries. Because offshoring wasnot the only cause of job loss in the atrisk occupations, the number ofjobs moved offshore was undoubtedly less than 109,000 jobs annually.10 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYSuch estimates, however, may understate or overstate the totalimpact of offshoring on employment. The estimates may understate thetotal impact because domestic companies with expanding worldwideemployment may have located many of their newly created jobs abroadeven when they did not reduce their U.S. employment. Some of theseforeign jobs might provide services to U.S. customers and potentiallycould have been located in the United States. Conversely, the estimatesmay overstate the total job loss from offshoring if the foreign outsourcing of some support jobs prevents the loss of other domestic jobs bykeeping U.S. firms competitive in world markets. For example, costreductions from offshoring IT jobs might help a U.S. financial servicescompany win foreign contracts, preserving many professional andsupport jobs in the United States.An evaluation of recent projectionsAlthough the loss of service jobs to foreign locations has been relatively small so far, the pace of offshoring is likely to be higher in theyears ahead. McCarthy 2004 finds that the pace of offshoring activityhas temporarily increased to about 200,000 to 300,000 jobs annually.5In part, the pace of servicesector offshoring has accelerated because ofgreater awareness of the potential cost savings from offshoring andincreased capabilities of Indian and U.S. vendors. The pace of offshoring is projected to slow somewhat later in this decade before risingto about 340,000 jobs per year from 2010 to 2015 Chart 2.McCarthy predicts a cumulative job loss by 2015 of 3.4 million jobsand an associated wage loss of about 151 billion.Alternative calculations by Goldman, Sachs  Company implythat McCarthys projections may be somewhat conservative Tilton.One approach looks at the share of service jobs that could be offshoredon a sectorbysector basis using information from industry experts.The second takes the service industry as a whole and estimates the shareof each occupation that could be offshored. The Goldman, Sachsresearchers find that, depending on the underlying assumptions, up to6 million service jobs could be offshored over the next decade.6 ThisECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 11study also finds greater shortrun potential for offshoring, concludingthat service offshoring could ramp up to a few hundred thousand jobsper year over the next two to three years.Such projections are subject to considerable uncertainty. Of necessity, these studies rely heavily on expert judgment about the prospectsfor servicesector offshoring. Because service offshoring is such a newphenomenon and is associated with rapid structural changes, projections based on more formal statistical techniques would probably not beany more reliable than expert opinion. In addition, the pace of offshoring might be affected by political events, such as protectionistlegislation in the United States or geopolitical events, which are difficultto predict over a 10to15 year horizon.II. WHY ARE SERVICE JOBS MOVING OFFSHOREDespite the uncertainty associated with recent estimates of joblosses, most observers agree that the trend toward offshoring servicesector production and jobs is likely to continue. A variety of economic,Chart 2TOTAL NUMBER OF U.S. JOBS MOVING OFFSHORE 2000 TO 20150.13.40.81.70.00 0.001.75 1.753.502000 2005 2010 20153.50Sources Estimated number for 2000 is from McCarthy 2002. Projections for 2005, 2010, and2015 are from McCarthy 2004Millions of jobs12 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYtechnological, and regulatory factors are driving this shift in productionand jobs. This section will discuss these factors and consider whichservicesector jobs are most vulnerable to offshoring in the future.Economic factorsLower production costs in foreign countries are a major cause ofservicesector offshoring. Although the costs of land and other resourcesmay be cheaper abroad, the main difference between the United Statesand developing countries is labor costs. There is a large gap in computerprogrammer wages between the United States and other countriesTable 2. In addition, the cost of benefits such as health insurance andpension contributions is likely to be much higher in the United States.7The true difference in labor costs per unit of output may not be aslarge as these wage figures suggest, however, because U.S. workers havehigh average levels of productivity.8 High average productivity by U.S.workers reflects our advanced technology and large amounts of capitalper worker Irwin. Such capital includes both physical capital, such asmachinery and computers, and human capital, such as skills andknowledge. The cost savings from offshoring also might be reduced ifthe firm incurs higher transportation and telecommunication costs ormanagement spends more time on service quality and data security.Still, the much lower levels of wages and benefits in developing countries suggest that many services can be produced abroad at lower cost.Certainly many managers in the information technology industry havethis perception. A recent survey of 252 managers found that 44 percentranked reducing or controlling costs as the most important reason foroffshoring King.The relocation of laborintensive service activities, such as legaltranscription services, to countries with lower labor costs is consistentwith economists basic theory of international tradecomparativeadvantage. According to this theory, countries like India or China witha relative abundance of unskilled labor should specialize in laborintensive production. Conversely, the United States and other developedcountries with a relative abundance of physical and human capitalshould specialize in capitalintensive production.ECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 13Country Salary rangePoland and Hungary 4,800  8,000India 5,880  11,000Philippines 6,564Malaysia 7,200Russian Federation 5,000  7,500China 8,952Canada 28,174Ireland 23,000  34,000Israel 15,000  38,000United States 60,000  80,000Sources CIO magazine, November 2002 Smart Access Survey, Merrill Lynch as reported in Bardhan and KrollTable 2AVERAGE SALARIES OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMERSU.S. DOLLARSThe recent offshoring of computer programming jobs shows,however, that some developingcountry workers are gradually acquiringthe human capital needed to be competitive in tasks requiring higherlevels of skill and education. The number of highly educated workershas expanded in India and other developing countries, increasing theskills available for many IT tasks, such as routine programming andbackoffice operations. The high quality of Indias universities has contributed to this increase in human capital in areas such as programmingand mathematics, although other kinds of human capital, such asproject management and product development skills, may be harder todevelop through formal education programs.914 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYTechnological factorsAlthough lower production costs abroad are a major reason forservicesector offshoring, the difference in labor costs is not new. Therefore, the recent growth in servicesector offshoring must have beentriggered by other factors. Technological advances in computers andtelecommunications likely have played an important role.10 Recentadvances in information technology are allowing companies to locateservice activities in other countries in much the same way that pastadvances in transportation and communication allowed manufacturersto outsource goods production abroad.Sharp declines in shipping costs and longdistance telephone costsduring the last century contributed to rapid growth of internationalmerchandise trade. Increasingly, companies were able to locate laborintensive production processes in whatever country offered the lowestcosts along with a favorable business environment. Hummels,Rapoport, and Yi show that world goods production has becomemore vertically specialized, with countries focusing on different stagesof the production process and then shipping intermediate goods toother countries for further processing. For example, a multinationalcompany based in the United States might do most of its marketingand research domestically but produce components in Indonesia andTaiwan with final assembly of the product in Malaysia for sale back tothe United States.Increased vertical specialization now is occurring in the serviceindustries as well. New information and communications technologies,such as fiberoptic cable, personal computers, and the Internet, encourage vertical specialization in service production by loweringcommunications costs.11 In the past, most services had to be producednear the customer. For many services, such as nursing or hairstyling,direct contact remains necessary. But laborintensive service productioncan increasingly be located in regions of the United States or foreigncountries with lower labor costs, while creative and management functions may remain at highercost locations.Empirical research also suggests that the spread of new informationtechnologies promotes increased international services trade. Freundand Weinhold find that increased Internet access is related positively toECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 15the growth rate of a countrys international services trade. After controlling for GDP and exchange rates, they find that a 10 percent increase inInternet penetration in a foreign country is associated with a 1.7 percentage point increase in the growth of service exports and a 1.1percentage point gain in the growth of service imports.Regulatory factorsA third factor that likely contributed to the growth of internationalservices trade in the 1990s was deregulation of the service industries andtrade liberalization by both developed and some developing countries.International trade in services includes a broad array of industries, suchas financial services, entertainment, transportation, and telecommunications as well as business and professional services. Many of theseindustries are heavily regulated because of their economic importanceand political sensitivity. For example, most countries have limitedforeign ownership in telecommunications and broadcasting and haveclosed their postal services to foreign entry Hufbauer and Warren.But over the last decade, many countries have begun to deregulatetheir domestic service industries or increase the access of foreign serviceproviders Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.These efforts to deregulate and liberalize have partly reflected international competitive pressures. Some countries concluded that highlyregulated and often overpriced telecommunications firms and utilitiesraise production costs for other companies, putting them at a competitive disadvantage in world markets. In addition, the realization hasgrown that inefficient and uncompetitive service firms reduce the livingstandard of domestic consumers.As other countries have started to deregulate some industries andliberalize their restrictions on international services trade, developingcountries have adopted new technologies at a faster rate. As a result,telecommunications and transportation costs have tended to fall. Suchfactors have made some foreign countries much more attractive as apotential location for offshoring by U.S. companies.1216 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYWhich jobs are most vulnerableGiven the rapid changes in technology and economic structure andthe risk of a political backlash against servicesector offshoring, no onecan be certain which service jobs will be most subject to foreign competition. Some jobs are unlikely to be outsourced abroad because the workmust be performed in the immediate proximity of the customer. Personal service jobs, such as barbers and gardeners, are sure to remain inthe United States, as are most jobs in healthcare. But the fact thatIndian radiologists can screen xrays for U.S. patients demonstrates thateven some healthcare jobs can be sent offshore.13The preceding discussion of the factors driving servicesector offshoring suggests some characteristics of jobs that are more likely to beoutsourced abroad Table 3. First, consistent with the theory of comparative advantage, U.S. servicesector jobs are more likely to beoutsourced abroad if they are part of laborintensive productionprocesses. All other things equal, firms can reduce their costs more byoffshoring jobs where labor is a high fraction of production costs. Forexample, an Internet retailer might manage its main computerserversa relatively capitalintensive processin the United States,while more laborintensive processes, such as writing online descriptions of merchandise or correcting billing problems, might be locatedoffshore.A second important characteristic of jobs that are more likely tobe offshored is that they are informationbased. In the service sector,recent advances in information technology are a key factor shiftingthe boundaries between traded and nontraded services. As a result,informational factors have a central role in determining which servicejobs are most vulnerable to offshoring. This explains why the businessprocess jobs that are being offshored are mostly whitecollar, informationbased jobs, such as billing and accounting, computerprogramming, and customer service jobs.14A third characteristic that makes jobs more vulnerable to offshoringis that jobrelated tasks are codifiable, meaning the tasks can largely bereduced to a set of rules or instructions that workers can follow routinely. Jobs with this characteristic can be more easily transmitted overfiberoptic lines to wherever the instructions can be executed at lowestECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 17Job characteristic ExplanationLaborintensive Cheaper foreign labor costs mean that jobs are more likely to be offshored if labor makes up a large share of production costs. Labor is a relatively large part of the costs in a telephone call center or legal transcription service.Informationbased Jobs that collect, manipulate, or organize information are more likely to be offshored because recent technological advances are reducing the cost and increasing the feasibility of producing information services at a remote location. Most business process jobs, such as accounting, billing, and payroll, are informationbased.Codifiable Jobs that can be reduced to a routine set of instructionscan be conducted more easily at a remote location and may require less experience or training. Answering routine customer inquiries can often be reduced to a simple set of instructions.Hightransparency Services can be performed more easily at a remote location when the information to be exchangedbetween the customer and the service provider is easy to measure and to verify. Analyzing a companysfinancial ratios can be offshored more easily thanassessing its management skills.Table 3CHARACTERISTICS OF VULNERABLE JOBS18 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYcost. At call centers, for example, employees who make sales calls orconduct telephone surveys can often follow a written script and providestandard answers to frequently asked questions. In contrast, doctors,lawyers, and school teachers must exercise a large amount of judgmentin how they deal with complex information, making such jobs moredifficult to execute from a remote location.The preceding characteristics apply largely to the tasks executed bythe workers. A fourth characteristic of easily offshored jobs is a highdegree of transparency in the information to be transmitted between theworker and the customer. When customer information is easily available and verifiable, the transaction can be more readily conducted at aremote location. For example, credit information is easily available onmost U.S. households, making it possible to set up a fairly simple ruleto determine who is eligible for a new credit card. Such information canbe sent abroad and processed wherever the cost is lowest. But manysmall businesses are more informationally opaque. Berger and othersargue that provision of financial services to such businesses may beeasier for institutions headquartered in the nation where the services areprovided. An offshore banker would find it more difficult to visit acompanys management, customers, and suppliers to collect more qualitative information.15 When customer information is not highlytransparent, facetoface contact may be an important advantagebecause the buyer and seller can develop higher levels of trust andunderstanding Leamer and Storper.Examination of these characteristics provides some reassurance that,although some U.S. service jobs are vulnerable to offshoring, manyothers are not. Many backoffice functions may be vulnerable to relocation abroad, and continued progress in information technology maygradually extend the range of tasks that can be offshored.16 However, thedifficulty of codifying some tasks and the need for facetoface contactensure that the vast majority of highskilled jobs will remain in theUnited States.ECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 19III. ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OFFSHORINGThe offshoring of services is likely to continue, and probably evenaccelerate in the years ahead, because companies face strong economicincentives to move certain productive activities to cheaper foreign locations. Moreover, technological advances and deregulation haveexpanded the kinds of activities that can be located abroad. ManyAmericans are naturally concerned that offshoring may reduce U.S.output and employment. However, other important issues include theimpact of offshoring on the average living standard and the distributionof income.Longrun effects on output and employmentEconomic theory suggests that international trade will not reduceU.S. output or employment over the long run, and, in fact, such tradewill likely have positive longrun effects. The movement of servicejobs to a foreign location does not permanently reduce domesticoutput or employment. In the long run, real GDP is determined bythe nations productive resources, such as the size of the labor forceand the amount of physical capital, and by technology. If theeconomy is operating below its potential output as determined bythese factors, wages and prices can adjust to eliminate imbalances andredirect labor and other resources to their best uses. These adjustments may take a long time, however, if prices and wages changesluggishly. As a result, monetary or fiscal policy can be eased to stimulate the demand for domestically produced goods and services.17Easier monetary policy can stimulate interestsensitive private spending, such as residential investment or consumer purchases of durablegoods. More stimulative fiscal policy may raise government purchasesof goods and services directly or encourage private spending throughlower taxes or higher transfer payments.Exchange rate adjustments can also play an important role inkeeping the economy operating at its longrun potential output. If offshoring or some other factor causes the United States to run a tradedeficit, the foreign exchange value of the dollar may come under downward pressure. A lower value for the dollar tends to increase the dollar20 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYprice of imported goods and services, making U.S. consumers and businesses more reluctant to buy from abroad. Dollar depreciation alsotends to make domestically produced goods and services more competitive in foreign markets, generating additional output and employmentin the United States.Over the long term, offshoring also may produce new exportopportunities for U.S. companies by encouraging more rapid growth indeveloping countries, such as China and India. In international servicestrade, the United States is highly competitive in such industries asentertainment, financial services, tourism, and advanced medical services. Wilson and Purushothaman project that China will have theworlds largest economy by 2050, and India will have the worlds thirdlargest economy after the United States. As countries incomes perperson rise, spending on services increases as a share of GDP, potentiallycreating new demand for U.S. service exports. Although these longrunopportunities may offer little consolation to workers currently displacedby import competition, such projections suggest the United States canremain a leader in international services trade.Shortrun effects on employmentAlthough servicesector offshoring will not reduce U.S. employment over the long run, a faster pace of offshoring may have shortrunemployment effects. Job losses in sectors experiencing rapid offshoringmay require the reallocation of labor from the offshoring sectors toother industries that are creating domestic jobs. Jobs losses due to offshoring are likely to be permanent in the sense that the workers will notbe recalled to a similar position with that company. Workers whose jobshave been permanently lost are more likely to move to another state orswitch occupations to find new employment. As a result, they may beunemployed longer than the average job loser, and they may experiencegreater longterm income losses.18Research on displaced manufacturing workers shows the costs oftraderelated job losses vary substantially depending on the characteristics of individual workers. Kletzer found that displaced manufacturingworkers experienced earnings losses averaging 12 percent upon reemployment. In comparison, displaced nonmanufacturing workers hadECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 21average earnings losses of just under 4 percent. But the reemploymentprospects of manufacturing workers depended heavily on the individualworkers characteristics. Younger and moreeducated workers hadgreater success in finding new jobs. Older, lesseducated workers withlong tenures in their job were unemployed longer or, if reemployed,were more likely to experience earnings losses exceeding 30 percent.The reemployment prospects of recently displaced IT workersmay be relatively good compared with displaced manufacturingworkers. It is unclear to what extent the findings for manufacturingworkers carry over to service workers. But to the extent that thesefindings do apply, displaced IT workers may have better reemployment prospects because they tend to be younger and better educated.Reemployment may still require costly job search and longterm earnings losses for some computer programmers or other IT workerswhose specific skills are no longer needed domestically.19 However,even these individuals often possess more general computer skills thatmay improve their job prospects.The living standardThe most basic concern about servicesector offshoring, however, isits effect on the U.S. living standard. In discussing the living standard,it is useful to distinguish between the average real income of the U.S.population measured in terms of the goods and services people canpurchase and the distribution of income across persons. Economictheory suggests that offshoring, like other increases in internationaltrade, is likely to raise the average real income of U.S. citizens. Servicesector offshoring is likely to lower the cost of some services toconsumers simply because it reduces firms production costs, and in ahighly competitive economy much of those cost savings will be passedon to consumers.20 To the extent that businesses keep those cost savingsas higher profits, firms may expand their investment in U.S. plant andequipment or increase dividend payments to their predominantly U.S.shareholders. For these gains by U.S. citizens to be maintained over thelong run, U.S. exports will eventually have to rise enough to pay for the22 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYincreased imports, and the labor released by offshoring will have to beredeployed to other sectors in which the United States has a comparative advantage.Moreover, increased international trade in services may raise U.S.productivity growth over the long run. International trade shiftsresources from sectors where U.S. workers are comparatively less efficient to sectors where they are comparatively more efficient. The U.S.comparative advantage is likely to be in industries employing largeamounts of physical and human capital per worker, factors that increaselabor productivity. As a result, U.S. labor is likely to be shifted towardindustries with higher real output per worker.21 A different issue iswhether offshoring leads to mismeasurement of productivity growth.This issue is discussed in the accompanying box. In addition, foreigncompetition puts pressure on U.S. firms to innovate by developing newproducts, improving their management techniques, and so forth. Manyempirical studies find that more open economies tend to have fasterproductivity growth Edwards. Offshoring could also facilitate greater IT investment in the future.Some economists argue that the offshoring of IT hardware productionhelped drive down the costs of hightechnology goods and speeded theadoption of new technologies, raising U.S. productivity growth in thelate 1990s. A similar process now may be under way in computer software and services Mann. To the extent that foreign production ofcomputer software and services lowers costs, adoption of these technologies will likely expand further in healthcare, construction, andother services, categories that have lagged in productivity growth.But economists have long realized that the living standards of someworkers and their families can be hurt by free trade even if average realincome per person improves. Computer programmers might, forexample, be displaced from highpaying jobs when companies offshoresome of their programming to India. In principle, the governmentcould enact policies to redistribute some of the overall economic gain toworkers displaced by import competition, leaving them better off thanbefore, but such redistributions often do not take place in practice.The U.S. income distribution appears to have become moreunequal in the 1990s, with highly educated workers gaining relative tothose with less human capital. However, most research finds thatECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 23Box 2EFFECTS OF OFFSHORING ON MEASUREDPRODUCTIVITY GROWTHHow does offshoring affect the measurement of U.S. labor productivity Some commentators have argued that recent productivitygrowth is overstated because of rising offshore production. Accordingto this view, a software company might relocate programming jobs toIndia but continue to book software sales from its U.S. office. In thisexample, the companys domestic output may appear to remain thesame while domestic employment goes down, increasing measuredoutput per U.S. worker.Conceptually, the U.S. national income accounts are constructedin a way that prevents this type of overstatement of domestic productivity. Computer programming performed abroad is a service inputthat is subtracted from the value of goods and services sold in calculating U.S. GDP. Thus, the net value produced domestically goes downthrough offshoring in addition to domestic employment, leaving productivity correctly measured.In principle, measurement errors in service imports might resultin either overstatement or understatement of U.S. productivitygrowth. Many international transactions may not be measured correctly, as evidenced by the large errors and omissions component ofthe international accounts. The prices of international service transactions may be hard to determine accurately, particularly when thetransactions occur between foreign and domestic affiliates of the samecompany rather than being traded between unrelated firms in themarket.However, even if the national accounts were missing largeamounts of servicesector offshoring, recent U.S. productivity growthwould still appear far too rapid to be explained by such mismeasurement DeLong, Schultze. If measured service imports were too low by100 billion and this missing component developed over the last twoyears, U.S. productivity growth would be overstated by only 0.4percent per year. Such a gain would explain only a small part of therapid U.S. productivity growth over that period.24 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYimport competition and offshoring have been minor causes of growingincome inequality.22 Technological advances, such as computers andother information technology, were probably the main reason forgrowing inequality. Employers have demanded moreeducated workers,who could more easily master new technologies.The effects of servicesector offshoring on the U.S. income distribution in the years ahead will not necessarily match the experience ofthe 1990s. Some of the computer programming and other technicaljobs that are being offshored require higherthanaverage skill levels andpay aboveaverage wages. Other offshored jobs, such as routine backoffice tasks and some callcenter jobs, involve lower skill levels andbelowaverage wages. Given the uncertainties about which type of jobwill be affected the most by future offshoring, the effect on the U.S.income distribution is difficult to predict. But it is certainly possiblethat offshoring could continue to make the income distribution lessequal if foreign competition disproportionately hurts lesseducatedservice workers and if moreeducated workers can shift quickly to otherhigh valueadded jobs.In summary, servicesector offshoring may cause temporary dislocations as some workers are displaced by more efficient service providersin other countries, but domestic output and employment should not belowered permanently. Moreover, increased international trade in services is likely to raise the average U.S. living standard over the long run,although the possibility cannot be ruled out that servicesector offshoring will make the nations income distribution less equal.IV. ISSUES FOR U.S. POLICYMAKERSAlthough there are sound reasons to believe that servicesector offshoring ultimately can improve the average U.S. living standard, theshortrun dislocations and the reduced longrun prospects facing someworkers make offshoring a growing political issue. Policymakers arecoming under increasing pressure to do something about the issue.Indeed, policymakers should be proactive in several areas related tointernational services trade, but poorly conceived policy actions mightdo more harm than good. This section evaluates various policyresponses to servicesector offshoring.ECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 25Macroeconomic policyIn the face of import competition, maintaining aggregate U.S.output and employment equal to potential over the long run is largely amatter of macroeconomic policies. As noted earlier, in the long run,proper macroeconomic policies can help to keep U.S. output growingat a sustainable rate with low inflation. Monetary and fiscal policiesinfluence the overall demand for goods and services, and exchange rateadjustments alter the competitiveness of domestic products relative tothose produced abroad. Monetary or fiscal policy instruments must beset with the overall economy in mind, however, and the overalleconomy reflects such factors as rapid technological change and cyclicaldemand fluctuations as well as offshoring.But rapid structural changeof which offshoring is a partmaycreate more uncertainty for policymakers about the degree of slack inthe economy and the proper settings for policy instruments. Forexample, Silvia argues that globalization and rapid productivity growthhave caused past statistical relationships between real GDP growth andemployment growth to break down. And a faster pace of job restructuring may raise the economys equilibrium unemployment rate, making itharder to use unemployment as a measure of cyclical slack and, therefore, as a guide to setting monetary and fiscal policies. Kohn notes thatit may not be possible to isolate the structural factors from the cyclicalfactors with much confidence until the economy comes much closer tofull employment.Trade policyAs servicesector offshoring has grown, policymakers have comeunder increased pressure to restrict service imports. For example, thestate of New Jersey required a computerservice contractor to relocatean 11employee help center to Camden from Bombay at an extra costto the state of nearly 1 million Schroeder and Aeppel. Moreover, aprovision in a spending bill signed in early 2004 prohibited the federalgovernment from awarding certain contracts to private companies thatwould perform the work overseas Schneider. Although this provisionwas little noticed domestically and affects few contracts, the measurearoused fears of U.S. protectionism in India.26 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYEconomic research finds that protectionism is a costly way to preserve U.S. jobs. For example, Francois, Arce, Reinert, and Flynnestimate that protection of U.S. coastal shipping has cost Americansbetween 200,000 and 387,000 annually in reduced national incomeper job protected, while Hufbauer and Goodrich calculate that therecently revoked safeguards for the U.S. steel industry caused a net lossof jobs because of layoffs by steelconsuming industries. When adomestic industry is unlikely to regain its international competitiveness,a better option is to adopt policies that ease the reallocation of labor andcapital to industries with stronger competitive positions. Because U.S.capital markets are already quite flexible, policymakers need to focusprimarily on labor reallocation.Although current laws provide assistance to manufacturing workersdisplaced by international trade, some economists advocate expandingand redirecting such programs. For example, Kletzer and Litan proposewage insurance for displaced workers as opposed to the current system,which emphasizes extended unemployment benefits. Under their proposal, wage insurance would reimburse eligible workers for somefraction of their wage loss, but the reimbursement would be paid onlywhen the workers are reemployed. Such a system would providestronger incentives for workers to take a new job rather than remainingunemployed and would emphasize onthejob learning instead of training programs. Displaced workers would also receive subsidies for healthinsurance while unemployed. Although some older manufacturingworkers became eligible in 2003 for the Alternative Trade AdjustmentAssistance Program, which incorporates some of these features, whitecollar workers and those under the age of 50 are not eligible for suchassistance. With service offshoring likely to grow in importance, policymakers could consider extending adjustment assistance to displacedservicesector employees.Another area where U.S. policymakers should be proactive is international trade negotiations to reduce foreign barriers to services tradeand protect the intellectual property of U.S. companies. Althoughservicesector deregulation is contributing to increased offshoring,many foreign service industries remain highly regulated Hufbauer andWarren. Trade negotiations can help assure access to foreign marketsfor efficient U.S. service companies. In addition, U.S. service compaECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 27nies must have adequate protection for their copyrights, patents, andother intellectual property, which are an important basis for their international comparative advantage.Immigration policySome observers have also linked servicesector offshoring to U.S.immigration policy. One concern is that temporary foreign workers inthe IT industry acquired skills and business contacts during their U.S.stay that facilitated offshoring when those workers returned to theirhome countries. When computer programmers and other technologyworkers were in short supply in the late 1990s, U.S. firms often temporarily hired skilled workers with H1B visas. In October 2003, theannual quota for such visas declined to 65,000 workers from a limit of195,000 workers in the previous three years.Temporary immigration of highly skilled workers may have variouseconomic effects. Increased temporary immigration in the late 1990smay have held down the wages of some skilled U.S. workers. But fluctuations in the number of temporary immigrants also may cushion U.S.employees against sharp downturns in demand because temporaryworkers often return to their home countries if they lose their employment in the United States.Although temporary workers in the IT industry may carry technicalknowledge back to their home countries, any assessment of immigration policies also must recognize that skilled immigrants provideimportant benefits to U.S. companies. Craig Barrett, the chief executiveof Intel, has been quoted as saying that shortages of skilled engineeringgraduates in the United States are more likely to drive jobs abroad thanthe presence of immigrant workers. Policymakers must be careful not tochoke off the flow of welleducated workers who are needed to runinnovative, knowledgebased service companies.Education and researchTo further improve the U.S. living standard, policymakers mustensure that the nation has highly educated workers of its own and afertile research environment. Recent economic growth has come largely28 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYfrom new ideas embodied in our human and physical capital ratherthan increased material input and manual labor Greenspan. The U.S.comparative advantage in international services trade is based largely onour relative abundance of human capital and our ability to generatenew ideas. Currently, however, the United States may not be graduatingenough workers with the skills demanded by new technologies. Inmany service industries, U.S. companies will need more educated andcreative workers to maintain their international competitiveness. Policymakers must, therefore, improve our educational system and enhancetraining opportunities for workers of all ages.As developing countries build their human capital and move intohigher valueadded services, U.S. companies will need to innovate andcreate new products that can be exported to growing foreign markets.Strong research institutions, such as universities and corporate laboratories, are essential to maintaining a rapid pace of innovation. Suchinnovation is based not only on new technologies but also on newproducts and business models that can take full advantage of the technological advances. Specialized institutions, such as venture capitalfirms and business incubators, play an important role in building internationally competitive industries using new technologies.State and local policiesOffshoring of servicesector jobs also raises important issues forstate and local policymakers. The outsourcing of government supportservices to foreign locations is one of the main areas where efforts torestrict offshoring have arisen. As the New Jersey example cited earliermakes clear, jobs can be kept at a domestic location, but often at a highcost to taxpayers. Governments choosing this course will have less tospend on other needs unless their citizens are willing to be taxed more.Offshoring also raises issues for economic development officials.State and local governments sometimes offer large incentives to attractspecific businesses or industries to a particular geographic area. A majorgoal of such incentives is typically to generate new jobs. Because of therecent technological changes that facilitate servicesector offshoring andthe uncertainty about which jobs and industries will be affected, development officials should be cautious about targeting incentives to serviceECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 29industries. Governments often have a hard time predicting whichindustries will prosper and which will lose in the rapidly changingglobal economy. A recently attracted telephone call center, for example,might suddenly relocate to another country or the jobs might bereplaced by new voicerecognition technologies.23As a result, many economists advise against targeting specificindustries or companies. Governments should focus on providingbasic services, education, and infrastructure that can serve a widerange of industries, while allowing private investors to select specificbusiness opportunities. To the extent, however, that incentives willbe targeted to specific industries, development officials should consider whether their target industries may be vulnerable tooffshoring. Table 3 can help officials evaluate which industries mayfeel increased pressures to move jobs offshore.V. CONCLUSIONAlthough the offshoring of servicesector jobs is still small relativeto the total U.S. job market, offshoring is likely to increase in thefuture. Many service tasks can be performed abroad more cheaplybecause of lower foreign labor costs, reduced telecommunications costs,and technological advances that allow more services to be produced atremote locations. Although the offshoring of service jobs displaces someworkers, who may experience anxiety and lasting economic losses, offshoring should not permanently lower the nations employment orproduction. And, it is likely to improve the average living standard ifdisplaced workers are retrained and moved into new jobs with highervalue added.Although international services trade ultimately can benefit theU.S. standard of living, policymakers should not be complacent. Thekey, however, is to choose the right policy actions. Laws protecting aparticular service industry will likely raise the costs of services to consumers and other businesses, hurting overall welfare. Instead,policymakers should ease the movement of resources from sectors thatare losing to international competition toward sectors that are gaining.Improved educational systems, better trade adjustment programs, andinternational negotiations to open foreign markets and guarantee intel30 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYlectual property rights are areas where proactive policy can improvenational welfare. In addition, sound monetary and fiscal policies canhelp maintain full employment for U.S. citizens.ECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 31ENDNOTES1Similarly, the sharp decline in manufacturing employment in Chart 1should not be attributed solely to import competition and offshoring. Althoughmanufacturing began to decline before the recession, the cyclical downturn andthe September 11 terrorist attacks weakened manufacturing. In addition, thedecline in manufacturings share of total employment is part of a longrun trend.Rapid productivity growth has allowed manufacturers to expand their outputwhile reducing employment. Declining factory employment has become a worldwide phenomenon affecting Japan, Brazil, and China as well as the United StatesHilsenrath and Buckman.2McCarthys estimates are based on a judgmental analysis of how differentoccupations would be affected by offshoring. This method will be described inmore detail later in the article. Zandis estimates are based on a simulation ofEconomy.coms model of the U.S. economy under the assumption that thenonoil trade deficit remained at the 400 billion level prevailing in early 2001. Inthe simulation, the economy loses fewer service jobs than actually occurred, withthe difference being attributed to offshoring. Zandi notes, however, that the simulation probably overstates job loss caused by offshoring since some of the erosionof the trade deficit probably had nothing to do with offshoring. In addition, it isnot clear whether the model fully captures other influences on employment during this period, such as rapid productivity growth or possible overinvestment inthe telecommunications industry.3Nonfarm payroll employment grew by about 1.9 million jobs per year overthe last decade. The loss of jobs through offshoring looks even smaller whenmeasured relative to gross job flows. Because there is a high degree of churn inthe job market with individual workers leaving one job and taking another, grossjob flows are much bigger than the net employment change in any given year.Bernanke estimates that about 31 million U.S. jobs are eliminated each year, ofwhich about 15 million are longerterm job losses. Thus, servicesector offshoringwould account for less than 1 percent of such losses.4Service occupations were classified as at risk using the categories in Bardhanand Kroll. These include office support occupations, business and financial support occupations, computer and math professionals, paralegals and legal assistants, diagnostic support services, and medical transcriptionists. Lowrisk serviceoccupations were calculated by the author as total employment minus workers infarming, construction and extraction, manufacturing, and atrisk services. Thecalculations used the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational employmentstatistics. Comparable data are available only for the period from 1999 to 2002. 5McCarthys study considers four main factors affecting the offshoring decision whether the service is delivered locally, whether necessary skills are availableoffshore, to what extent technology supports the business process, and whetherthe process is defined consistently and well documented. Based on these factors,McCarthy assigns a rank from 1 to 5 to each occupation indicating how rapidlyjobs are likely to move offshore in the future. For example, for occupational categories ranked at level 2, 1.5 percent of jobs are expected to move offshore by2005, 3.5 percent by 2010, and 8.0 percent by 2015. The same percentages apply32 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYto all occupational categories with this ranking. These percentages are thenapplied to 505 service occupations defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics tocompute the number of service jobs that are likely to move offshore.6Bardhan and Kroll also conclude that McCarthys projections may be tooconservative. They do not forecast the number of jobs that will move offshore,but they estimate that offshoring might adversely affect up to 14 million servicejobs. The adverse effects could include either relocation of the jobs to anothercountry or downward pressure on the wages and benefits paid by the remainingU.S. jobs.7According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, benefits represent 27.8 percentof total compensation for fulltime employees in serviceproducing industries.These industries include transportation, communication and public utilitieswholesale and retail trade finance, insurance, and real estate and service industries. Parttime workers receive, on average, much lower benefits as a percent oftotal compensation.8Baily and Solow summarize several studies comparing productivity acrosscountries. They find that in the mid1990s, labor productivity in Japan was about70 percent of the U.S. level, while the figures for Korea and Brazil were 36 percent and 42 percent, respectively. However, relative productivity levels varied substantially across industries. For example, Japan had higher productivity than theUnited States in automobile manufacturing and consumer electronics, but muchlower productivity in retailing, food processing, and construction. Although Bailyand Solow do not provide evidence for India, it seems likely that India has amuch lower average level of labor productivity than the United States, but itsinformation technology industry may come closer to U.S. levels than many otherIndian industries.9Some observers report that wages are rising rapidly in India for workers withthe highest levels of human capital. One Indian firm, for example, gave 80 percent raises in one year to retain its skilled employees Maher. But such sharpwage increases may reflect temporary skill shortages associated with the rapidgrowth in demand for Indian programmers. Over a longer horizon, the supply ofskilled Indian IT workers is also likely to grow, helping maintain the cost advantage of the Indian IT industry.10The recession and stock market correction also may have accelerated servicesector offshoring by forcing firms to reduce costs to improve their profitability.11Not only have these new technologies lowered international communications costs, but the dramatic increase in bandwidth has made some informationservices offshoring possible that simply would not have been feasible with oldertechnologies. Reliable data on the prices of international bandwidth are difficultto obtain. However, as an illustration, the price of international bandwidthbetween the United States and Japan fell from 114,052 per megabit in 1998 to10,464 in 2002. Although the prices might be very different for developingnations depending on the market structure of their telecommunications industry,these countries are experiencing similar downward trends. The InternationalTelecommunication Union reports that the AsiaPacific region is witnessing anexplosion of international Internet bandwidth. Reflecting recent increases inbandwidth, India now has more Internet than voice telephone capacity.ECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 3312Another issue receiving increased attention is whether the U.S. tax code formultinational corporations encourages offshoring. Multinationals with U.S.headquarters are taxed on their foreign income when this income is repatriated tothe United States rather than when it is accrued. Some observers contend that theability to defer these taxes gives U.S. multinationals an incentive to shift jobs andproduction abroad Liesman. However, others argue the corporate tax code formultinationals has complex effects, and that ending the deferral of taxes on foreign income could potentially hurt our economy Hines. For example, establishing foreign subsidiaries may allow U.S. multinational corporations to securegreater foreign market access for their products. The increased foreign sales couldlead, in turn, to additional hiring of highly paid managers and researchers at thecompanies U.S. headquarters. Hubbard argues there is growing evidence thatforeign affiliates are in fact complements to domestic investment and employment.13Pollack notes that offshoring of radiological services is actually quite smallat this time, and the offshoring of such services is unlikely to grow quickly in thefuture because of medical licensing requirements. Nevertheless, this example illustrates the power of new information technologies to facilitate servicesector offshoring.14Common language is also important in offshoring decisions because language plays a key role in information transmission. Customer service jobs are typically offshored to such countries as India or the Philippines, which have largeEnglishspeaking populations. For other tasks, however, common knowledge of acomputer programming language or mathematical symbols might be moreimportant than a common spoken language.15Such issues are not unique to the financial services industry. For example,many IT firms are still trying to determine which technology services can be offshored effectively and which cannot. Flynn quotes the executive vice president ofa consulting firm as saying, What companies are finding is that offshore can begood for generic, commodity services. Corporate customers have problems verylocal to their applications and very specific to their companies.16For example, improved quality and lower costs for videoconferencing mightmake it easier to perform less codifiable jobs from abroad. However, jobs that aregood candidates for offshoring also may tend to be performed by computers inthe future. Advances in voice recognition technology, expert systems, and artificial intelligence may eventually allow computers to handle many customer servicejobs and perhaps even routine xray screening.17The effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in an open economy partlydepends on the size of the country and its exchange rate system. For a large openeconomy with flexible exchange rates, such as the United States, both monetaryand fiscal policies can stimulate aggregate demand, although their effects may besmaller than in a closed economy Mankiw.18Groshen and Potter argue that various factors, such as technologicalchange, reorganization of production and offshoring, may have caused sectoralreallocation of labor and increased permanent layoffs in recent years. To theextent that sectoral reallocation has an important effect on joblessness, offshoringmight raise the economys equilibrium or natural rate of unemployment overthe longer run. However, economists do not universally agree that sectoral reallo34 FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF KANSAS CITYcation is an important cause of joblessness. Rissman finds, for example, thatstructural shifts across broad industry categories do not adequately explain sluggish employment growth. Moreover, some theories suggest that the natural rate ofunemployment depends on relatively stable factors, and that fluctuations in thenatural rate are unlikely to contribute much to observed fluctuations in theunemployment rate Hall.19For some IT workers, the boom in technology spending in the late 1990sand the scarcity of particular programming skills may have raised some programmers wages to levels that were unsustainable over the long term even without theexpanded offshoring of IT jobs. Such workers may have earned temporary rentsthat would have disappeared over time as the high wages encouraged more U.S.workers to acquire the new computer skills. In addition, the fall in technologyspending may have reduced the demand for such workers and their wage ratesindependently of the growth in offshoring.20In addition, offshoring may sometimes improve product quality. An example is faster delivery of a service because of timezone differences between theUnited States and an offshore processing center. One provider of Internet financial services, ELoan, offers some customers the opportunity to choose whethertheir loan application is processed in India or the United States. Customerschoosing India receive faster processing, although it is not clear that the fasterprocessing is due solely to the timezone difference. Most customers choose tohave their application processed abroad, suggesting customers value the fasterprocessing time.21Gordon provides a simple numerical example of how offshoring canincrease a firms labor productivity. However, Gordon also argues that offshoringhas been only a minor cause of the recent surge in U.S. productivity, and Sichelpoints out that the links between offshoring and productivity growth are muchmore complicated than Gordons simple example suggests.22See Cline and Irwin for a summary of the evidence. In addition, the wagesof workers with less human capital may have been depressed by competition forjobs from an increased flow of immigrants. Borjas, Freeman, and Katz find thewages of college graduates rose 21 percent relative to those of high school graduates from 1980 to 1995, but they estimate that international trade and immigration accounted for only 10 percent of this change.23Krueger notes that prediction of job growth is difficult because the labormarket is constantly changing. A quarter of all workers today are in occupationsthat were not even listed in the Census Bureaus occupation codes in 1967. Thatbeing the case, this article will not attempt to predict where the new jobs will becreated. However, there are many areas where the growth might come. An agingworld population may create many healthcare jobs, while biotechnology, nanotechnology, and alternative energy sources are sometimes identified as importantemerging technologies. Some observers believe that many new IT jobs will be created, but these may be in different areas and require different human capital thanthe IT jobs that are being offshored. The difficulty in predicting growth indemand for particular occupations should not lead to pessimism about the economys overall ability to generate jobs.ECONOMIC REVIEW  THIRD QUARTER 2004 35REFERENCESBaily, Martin Neil, and Robert M.
