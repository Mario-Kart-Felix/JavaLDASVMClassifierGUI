Abstract - Add to MetaCart Key words:RFID technology; battery compartment; electric vehicles; battery replacement charging stations Abstract. Regarding the development of the electric vehicle replacement charging stations, this paper comes up with the application solution of RFID technology in the electric vehicle battery replacement charging stations. This paper first analyzes the specific characteristics of the RFID technology, provides an overview on the RFID technology solution to solve the management problem of the battery compartment, introduces the RFID technology application on the management of charging vehicles, as well as on the unified management of battery compartment in battery replacement charging stations. The paper makes the outlook on the RFID technology application in other fields of the electric vehicle replacement charging stations. to the Internet of Things by Luca Veltri A, Simone Cirani A, Stefano Busanelli B, Gianluigi Ferrari A "... journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/adhoc ..."
