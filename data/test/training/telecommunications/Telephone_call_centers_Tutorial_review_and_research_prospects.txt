They are also fascinating sociotechnical systems in which the behaviorof customers and employees is closely intertwined with physical performance measures. Inthese environments traditional operational models are of great value  and at the same timefundamentally limited  in their ability to characterize system performance.We review the state of research on telephone call centers. We begin with a tutorial on howcall centers function and proceed to survey academic research devoted to the management oftheir operations. We then outline important problems that have not been addressed and identifypromising directions for future research.AcknowledgmentsThe authors thank Lee Schwarz, Wallace Hopp and the editorial board of MSOM for initiating thisproject, as well as the referees for their valuable comments.

contact centers, have become a preferred and prevalent means for companies to communicate with their customers. Most organizations with customercontact  private companies, as well as government and emergency services  have reengineeredtheir infrastructure to include from one to many call centers, either internally managed or outsourced. For many companies, such as airlines, hotels, retail banks, and credit card companies, callcenters provide a primary link between customer and service provider.The call center industry is thus vast and rapidly expanding, in terms of both workforce andeconomic scope. For example, a recent analysts report estimates the number of agents working inU.S. call centers to have been 1.55 million in 1999  more than 1.4 of privatesector employment and to be growing at a rate of more that 8 per year 47, 148. In 1998, ATT reported thaton an average business day about 40 of the more than 260 million calls on its network were tollfree 1. One presumes that the great majority of these 104 million daily 1800 calls terminatedat a telephone call center.The quality and operational efficiency of these telephone services can be extraordinary. In alarge, bestpractice call center, many hundreds of agents can cater to many thousands of phonecallers per hour agent utilization levels can average between 90 to 95 no customer encountersa busy signal and, in fact, about half of the customers are answered immediately the waiting timeof those delayed is measured in seconds, and the fraction that abandon while waiting varies fromthe negligible to a mere 12.At the same time, these example of best practice represent the exception, rather than the rule.Most call centers  even wellrun ones  do not consistently achieve such simultaneously high levelsof service quality and efficiency. In part, this fact may be due to a lack of understanding of thescientific principles underlying best practice.The performance gap is also likely due to the growing complexity of contact centers. Recenttrends in networking, skillsbased routing, and multimedia have fundamentally increased thechallenges inherent in managing contact centers. While simple analytical models have historicallyperformed an important role in the management of call centers, they leave much to be desired. Moresophisticated approaches are needed to accurately describe the reality of contactcenter operations,and models of this reality can improve contactcenter performance significantly.In this article, our aim is twofold. We first provide a tutorial on call centers that outlinesimportant operational problems. We then review the academic literature that is related to themanagement of callcenter operations, working from the current state of the art to open andemerging problems. Our focus is on mathematical models which potentially support callcentermanagement, and we primarily address analytical models that support capacity management.Analytical models can be contrasted with simulation techniques, which have been growing inpopularity see Section VIII in 103. This growth has occurred partly because of improved userfriendliness of simulation tools and partly in view of the scarcity of mathematical skills required forthe analytical alternatives. Perhaps it is mostly due to the widening gap between the complexityof the modern call center and the analytical models available to accommodate this complexity.We will not dwell here on the virtues and vices of analytical versus simulation models. Ourcontention is that, ideally, one should blend the two analytical models for insight and calibration,1simulation for fine tuning. In fact, our experience strongly suggests that having analytical modelsin ones arsenal, even limited in scope, improves dramatically ones use of simulation.There are two related reasons for our focus on capacity management. First, in most call centerscapacity costs in general, and human resource costs in particular, account for 6070 of operatingexpenses. Thus, from a cost perspective capacity management is critical. Second, the majorityof research to date has addressed capacity management. This no doubt reflects the traditionalemphasis of operations management OR  IE research, and it also is due to researchers sensitivityto the economic importance of capacity costs.Nevertheless, these traditional operational models do not capture a number of critical aspectsof callcenter performance, and we also discuss what we believe to be important determinants thathave not been adequately addressed. These topics include a better understanding of the role playedby human factors, as well as the better use of new technologies, such as networking and skillsbasedrouting tools. Indeed, these behavioral and technological issues are closely intertwined, and webelieve that the ability to address these problems will often require multidisciplinary research.1.1 Additional ResourcesThe continued growth in both the economic importance and complexity of call centers has promptedincreasingly deep investigation of their operations. This is manifested by a growing body of academic work devoted to call centers, research ranging in discipline from Mathematics and Statistics,through Operations Research, Industrial Engineering, Information Technology and Human Resource Management, all the way to Psychology and Sociology.While the focus of the current article is operational issues and models, a number of complementary research resources also exist. In particular, Mandelbaum 103 provides a comprehensivebibliography of callcenterrelated work. It includes references and abstracts that cover well over250 research papers in a wide range of disciplines. Indeed, given the speed at which call centertechnology and research are evolving, advances are perhaps best followed through the internet,either via sites of researchers active in the area or through industry sites. For a list of web sites,see Section XI of 103.There also exists a number of academic review articles of which we are aware Pinedo etal. 126 provides the basics of call center management, including some analytical models Anupindiand Smythe 11 describes the technology that enables current and plausibly future call centersGrossman et al. 72 and Mehrotra 121 are both short overviews of some OR challenges in callcenter research and practice Anton 10 provides a managerial survey of the past, present andfuture of customer contact centers and Koole and Mandelbaum 95 is more narrowly focused onqueueing models. One may view our survey as a supplement to these articles, one that is aimedat academic researchers that seek an entry to the subject, as well as at practitioners who developcallcenter applications.Additional articles that we recommend as part of a quantitative introduction to call centersinclude the following. Buffa et al. 39 is an early, comprehensive treatment of the hierarchicalframework used by call centers to manage capacity. The series of four articles by Andrews etal. 7, 8, 9, 129 constitutes an interesting record of this groups work with the call center ofthe catalogue retailer, L.L. Bean. Similarly, Brigandi et al. 34 present work by ATT thatdemonstrates the monetary value of call center modelling. Mandelbaum, Sakov and Zeltyn 112,2parts of which have been adapted to the present text, provides a thorough descriptive analysis ofoperational data from a call center, and Brown et al. 36 is its complementary statistical analysis.Evenson et al. 52 and Duxbury et al. 48 discuss performance drivers and the state of the art ofcallcenter operations. Finally, Cleveland and Mayben 46 is a wellwritten overview by and forpractitioners though we take exceptions to some of its views, notably its treatment of customerabandonment 63 and its capacitysizing recommendations 141.1.2 Reading GuideThe headings within the Table of Contents provide some detail on the material covered in thevarious sections.

In 2.1, we provide background on thescope of callcenter operations. Then in 2.2 we describe how call centers work, and we definecommon callcenter nomenclature. Next, 2.3 describes how call centers commonly monitor theiroperations and measure their operating performance. In 2.4 we highlight the relationship betweencall centers and queueing systems. Then 2.5 discusses measures of service quality commonly usedin call centers.2.1 BackgroundAt its core, a call center constitutes a set of resources  typically personnel, computers and telecommunication equipment  which enable the delivery of services via the telephone. The working environment of a large call center Figure 1 can be envisioned as an endless room, with numerousopenspace cubicles, in which people with earphones sit in front of computer terminals, providingteleservices to phantom customers.3Figure 1 The Working Environment of a Call Center right image of First Direct 99Call centers can be categorized along many dimensions. The functions that they provide arehighly varied from customer service, help desk, and emergency response services, to telemarketingand order taking. They vary greatly in size and geographic dispersion, from small sites with a fewagents that take local calls  for example at a medical practice  to large national or internationalcenters in which hundreds or thousands of agents may be on the phone at any time.Furthermore, the latest telecommunications and information technology allow a call center tobe the virtual embodiment of a few or many geographically dispersed operations. These range fromsmall groups of very large centers that are connected over several continents  for example, in theU.S.A., Ireland, and India  to large collections of individual agents that work from their homes.The organization of work may also vary dramatically across call centers. When the skilllevelrequired to handle calls is low, a center may crosstrain every employee to handle every type ofcall, and calls may be handled first come, firstserved FCFS. In settings that require more highlyskilled work, each agent may be trained to handle only a subset of the types of calls that the centerserves, and skillsbased routing may be used to route calls to appropriate agents. In turn, theorganizational structure may vary from the very flat  in which essentially all agents are exposedto external calls  to the multilayered  in which a layer represents a level of expertise  andcustomers may be transferred through several layers before being served to satisfaction.A central characteristic of a call center is whether it handles inbound or outbound traffic. Inbound call centers handle incoming calls that are initiated by outside callers calling in to a center.Typically, these types of centers provide customer support, help desk services, reservation and salessupport for airlines and hotels, and ordertaking functions for catalog and webbased merchants.Outbound call centers handle outgoing calls, calls that are initiated from within a center. Thesetypes of operations have been traditionally associated with telemarketing and survey businesses.A recent development in some inbound centers is to initiate outbound calls to highvalue customerswho have abandoned their calls before being served.Our focus in this article is on inbound call centers, with some attention given to mixed operations4that blend incoming and outgoing calls. In fact, we are aware of almost no academic work devotedto pure outbound operations, the exception being Samuelson 133. Within inbound centers, theagents that handle calls are often referred to as customer service representatives CSRs or repsfor short. Appendix A summarizes the callcenter acronyms used in this review, and it displaysthe page numbers on which they are defined.In addition to providing the services of CSRs, many inbound call centers use interactive voiceresponse IVR units, also called voice response units VRUs. These specialized computers allowcustomers to communicate their needs and to selfserve. Customers interacting with an IVR usetheir telephone key pads or voices to provide information, such as account numbers or indications ofthe type of service desired. In fact, the latest generation of speechrecognition technology allowsIVRs to interpret complex user commands. In response, the IVR uses a synthesized voice toreport information, such as bank balances or departure times of planes. IVRs can also be usedto direct the centers computers to provide simple services, such as the transfer of funds amongbank accounts. For example, in many banking call centers, roughly 80 of customer calls are fullyselfserved using an IVR. Interestingly, the process by which customers who wish to speak to aCSR identify themselves, using an IVR, can average 30 seconds, even though subsequent queueingdelays often reach no more than a few seconds.A current trend is the extension of the call center into a contact center. The latter is a callcenter in which agents and IVRs are complemented by services in other media, such as email,fax, web pages, or chat in that order of prevalence. The trend toward contact centers has beenstimulated by societal hype surrounding the internet and by customer demand for channel variety,as well as by the potential for efficiency gains. In particular, requests for email and fax services canbe stored for later response and it is possible that, when standardized and well managed, theycan be made significantly less costly than telephone services.Our survey deals almost exclusively with pure telephone services. To the best of our knowledge, no analytical model has yet been dedicated to truly multimedia contact centers, though apromising framework skillsbased routing and a few models that accommodate IVRs, emails andtheir blending with telephone services, will be described in Section 5.2.2 How an Inbound Call is HandledThe largescale emergence of call centers has been enabled by technological advances in informationand communications systems. To describe these technologies, and to illustrate how they function,we will walk the reader through an example of the process by which a call center serves an incomingcall. Figure 2 provides a schematic diagram of the equipment involved.Consider customers in the U.S. who wish to buy a ticket from a large airline using the telephone.They begin the process of buying the ticket by calling a tollfree 800 number. The longdistanceor public service telephone network PSTN company that provides the 800 service to the airlineknows two vital pieces of information about each call the number from which the call originates,often called the automatic number identification ANI number and the number being dialed,named the calls dialed number identification service DNIS number. The PSTN provider uses theANI and DNIS to connect callers with the center.The airlines call center has its own, privatelyowned switch, called a private automatic branchexchange PABX or PBX, and the callers DNIS locates the PABX on the PSTNs network. If5customers PABXagentsIVRVRUACDCTIserverPSTNcustomerdata servertrunk linesFigure 2 Schematic Diagram of Call Center Technologythe airline has more than one call center on the network  both reachable via the same 800 number then a combination of the ANI, which gives the callers location, and the DNIS may be used toroute the call. For example, a caller from Atlanta may be routed to a Dallas call center, whileanother caller from Chicago  who calls the same 800 number  may be routed to a center in NorthDakota. Conversely, more than one DNIS may be routed to the same PABX. For example, theairline may maintain different 800 numbers for domestic and international reservations and haveboth types of call terminate at the same PABX.The PABX is connected to the PSTN through a number of telephone lines, often called trunklines, that the airline owns. If there are one or more trunk lines free, then the call will be connectedto the PABX. Otherwise, the caller will receive a busy signal. Once the call is connected it may beserved in a number of phases.At first, calls may be connected through the PABX to an IVR that queries customers on theirneeds. For example, in the case of the airline, callers may be told to press one if they wish tofind flight status information. If this is the case, then through continued interaction with the IVRcustomers may complete service without needing to speak with an agent.Customers may also communicate a need or desire to speak with a CSR, and in this case callsare handed from the IVR to an automatic call distributor ACD. An ACD is a specialized switch,one that is designed to route calls, connected via the PABX, to individual CSRs within the callcenter. Modern ACDs are highly sophisticated, and they can be programmed to route calls basedon many criteria.Some of the routing criteria may reflect callers status. For example, an airline may wish tospecially route calls from Spanishspeaking customers. This identification can happen in a number of ways though the DNIS, because a special 1800 number is reserved for Spanishspeakingcustomers through the ANI, which allows the callcenters computer system to identified the originating phone number as that of a Spanishspeaking customer or through interaction with the IVR,which allows callers who press 3 to identify themselves as Spanish speakers.The capabilities of agents may also be used in the routing of calls. For example, when agents atour example airlines call center begin working, they log into the centers ACD. Their login IDs arethen used to retrieve records that describe whether they are qualified to handle domestic andorinternational reservations, as well as whether or not they are proficient in Spanish.6Given its status, as well as that of the CSRs that are currently idle and available to take acall, the incoming call may be routed to the best available agent. If no suitable agent is free totake the call, the ACD may keep the call on hold and the customer waits until such an agentis available. While the decision of whether and to whom to route the call may be programmed inadvance, the rules that are needed to solve this skillsbased routing problem can turn out to bevery complex.Customers that are put on hold are typically exposed to music, commercials, or other information. A welcome, evolving trend is to provide delayed customers with predictions of theiranticipated wait. Delayed customers may judge that the service they seek is not worth the wait,become impatient, and hang up before they are served. In this case, they are said to abandon thequeue or to renege. Customers that do not abandon are eventually connected to a CSR.Once connected with a customer, agents can speak on the telephone while, at the same time, theywork via a PC or terminal with a corporate information system. In the case of our example airline,agents may discuss flight reservations with customers as they simultaneously query and enterdata into the companys reservation system. In large companies, such as airlines and retail banks,the information system is typically not dedicated to the call center. Rather, many call centers, aswell as other company branches, may share access to a centralized corporate information system.Computertelephone integration CTI middleware can be used to more closely integrate thetelephone and information systems. For instance, CTI is the means by which a calls ANI is usedto identify a caller and route a call it takes the ANI and uses it to query a customer databasein the companys information systems if there exists a customer in the database with the sameANI, then routing information from that customers record is returned. In our airline example, therouting information would be the customers preferred language.Similarly, CTI can be used to automatically display a callers customer record on a CSRsworkstation screen. By eliminating the need for the CSR to ask the caller for an account numberand to enter the number into the information system, this socalled screen pop saves the CSRtime and reduces the calls duration. If applied uniformly, it can also reduce variability amongservice times, thus improving the standardization of call handling procedures.In more sophisticated settings, CTI is used to integrate a special information system, called acustomer relationship management CRM system, into the call centers operations. CRM systemstrack customers records and allow them to be used in operating decisions. For example, a CRMsystem may record customer preferences, such as the desire for an aisle seat on an airplane, andallow CSRs or IVRs to automatically deliver more customized service. A CRM system may alsoenable a screen pop to include the history of the customers previous calls and, if relevant, dollarfigures of past sales the customer has generated. It may even suggest crossselling or upsellingopportunities, or it may be used to route the incoming call to an agent with special crosssellingskills.Once a call begins service, it can follow a number of paths. In the simplest case, the CSRhandles the callers request, and the caller hangs up. Even here, the service need not end instead,the CSR may spend some time on wrapup activities, such as an updating of the customers historyfile or the processing of an order that the customer has requested. It may also be the case thatthe CSR cannot completely serve the customer and the call must be transferred to another CSR.Sometimes there are several such handoffs.Finally, the service need not end with the call. Callers who are blocked or abandon the queue7may try to call again, in which case they become retrials. Callers who speak with CSRs butare unable to resolve their problems may also call again, in which case they becomes returns.Satisfactory service can also lead to returns.2.3 Data Generation and ReportingAs it operates, a large call center generates vast amounts of data. Its IVRs and ACD are specialpurpose computers that use data to mediate the flow of calls. Each time one of these switchestakes an action, it records the calls identification number, the action taken, the elapsed time sincethe previous action, as well as other pieces of information. As a call winds its way through a callcenter, a large number of these records may be generated.From these records, a detailed history of each call that enters the system can, in theory, bereconstructed when it arrived who was the caller what actions the caller took in the IVR andhow long each action took whether and how long the caller waited in queue whether and for howlong a CSR served the call who was the CSR. If the call center uses CTI, then additional datafrom the companys information systems may be included in the record what the call was aboutthe types of actions taken by a CSR related account information.In practice, call centers have not typically stored or analyzed records of individual calls, however.This may be due, in part, to the historically high cost of maintaining adequately large databases a large call center generates many gigabytes of callbycall data each month  but clearly thesequantities of data are no longer prohibitively expensive to store. It is also likely due to the factthat the software used to manage call centers  itself developed at a time when data storage wasexpensive  often uses only simple models which require limited, summary statistics. Finally, webelieve that it is due to lack of understanding of how and why more detailed analyses should becarried out. Section 6 describes current work that analyzes callbycall data. Sections 6 and 7argue for the longterm value of this type of work.Instead, call centers most often summarize callbycall data from the ACD and related systemsas averages that are calculated over short time intervals, most often 30 minutes in length. Figure3 displays twenty one halfhours worth of data from such a report.These ACD data are used both for planning purposes and to measure system performance.They are carefully and continuously watched by callcenter managers. They will also be central tothe discussion that continues through much of this article. Therefore, it is worth describing thecolumns of the report in some detail.The first four columns indicate the starting time of the halfhour interval, as well as counts ofcalls arriving to the ACD Recvd, sometimes called offered, is the total number of calls arrivingthat half hour Answ, sometimes called handled, the number of arriving calls that were actuallyanswered by a CSR and Abn , the percentage of arriving calls that abandoned before beingserved equals 1AnswRecvd 100. Note that the number of calls offered to the ACD maybe much smaller than the total number of calls arriving to the center. First, Recvd does notaccount for busy signals, which occur at the level of the PSTN and PABX. Furthermore, as alreadymentioned, in some industries it is not unusual for 80 of the calls arriving to a call center to beself service and to terminate in the IVR.Abn  is an important measure of system congestion. The next column reports another oneASA is the average speed of answer, the amount of time Answ calls spend on hold waiting8Figure 3 Example HalfHour Summary Report From an ACD from 95to speak to a CSR. Because ASA does not include the time that abandoned calls spend waiting,a reasonably full picture of congestion requires, at a minimum, both ASA and Abn  statistics.Call centers sometimes report additional measures of the delay in queue. For example the servicelevel, also called the telephone service factor TSF, is the fraction of calls whose delay fell below aprespecified servicelevel target. Typically the target is 20 or 30 seconds. Some call centers alsoreport the delay of the call that waited on hold the longest during the half hour.To interpret the remaining statistics in Figure 3, it is helpful to define the following three statesof CSRs who are logged into the ACD 1 active, namely handling a call 2 sitting idle, available tohandle a call and 3 not actively handling a call but not idle, unavailable to take calls. Over thecourse of each halfhour reporting interval, the ACD tracks the time that each CSR that is loggedinto the system spends in each of these states, and it aggregates total active, total available, andtotal unavailable time across all loggedin CSRs to calculate the figures statistics.The next column in Figure 3 reports the AHT, the average handle time per call, anothername for average service time equals total active  Answ. In some reports this total is brokendown into component parts talk time, the average amount of time a CSR spends talking to thecustomer during a call hold time, the average time a CSR puts a customer on hold during acall, once service has begun and wrap time, the average amount of time a CSR spends completingservice, after the caller has hung up.The remaining columns detail the productivity of the call centers CSRs. On Prod FTE isthe average number of full time equivalent FTE CSRs that were active or available during the9half hour equals total activetotal available  30 minutes. Occ , the system occupancy,is a measure of system utilization that excludes the time that CSRs were unavailable to serve callsequals total active  total active  total available  100. On Prod  is the fraction oftime that loggedin CSRs were actively handling or able to handle calls equals total activetotalavailable  total activetotal availabletotal unavailable  100. Sch Open FTE is thenumber of FTE CSRs that had been scheduled to be logged in during the half hour it is theplanned version of On Prod FTE. Finally, Sch Avail  relates the actual time spent loggedinto the original plan equals On Prod FTE  Sch Open FTE  100.Thus, the report records three sources of loss in CSR productivity. The first is idle time thatis presumably induced by naturally occurring stochastic variability in arrival and service timesand is captured by 100Occ . The second is the fraction of time that CSRs were originallyscheduled to be available to take calls but were not, which is calculated as 100On Prod .This percentage can be tracked against an operating standard that the call center maintains tomake sure that CSRs are not spending too much loggedin time unavailable. Similarly, the thirdsource, 100Sch Avail, allows callcenter managers to track the fraction of time CSRs are notlogged in, perhaps away from their work stations taking unplanned breaks. The latter two measuresare often monitored to diagnose perceived disciplinary problems CSRs lack of compliance withtheir assigned schedules.Note that the occupancies in Figure 3 are quite high, 97100 during much of the day. Thisdoes not mean, however, that every CSR spends 97100 of his or her work day speaking withcustomers. For example, suppose the arrival rate of calls to a center is a constant 2,850 per halfhour over an 8hour day. The AHT of a call is one minute, so the call center expects 2,850 minutesof calls to be served in every half hour, or 95 FTE CSRs worth of calls 95 CSRs  30 minutes perCSR  2,850 CSR minutes each half hour. The center does not allow CSRs to be unavailable, andin every half hour it makes sure that 100 CSRs are taking calls, so that Sched Open FTE  OnProd FTE  100. Therefore, Occ   95 and On Prod   Sch Avail   100 in everyhalf hour. The call center has 200 CSRs on staff, however, and each CSR is scheduled to spendonly half of the day on the phone. Indeed, as we will see in Section 3, CSRs are typically givenbreaks and offphone work that lower their overall, daily utilization to more sustainable levels.It is also worth noting that, although the statistics described above are averaged over all agentsworking, many can be archived also at the individualagent level. This practice is useful for monitoring individual compliance, and it can be used as a part of incentive compensative schemes.While the specifics of ACD reports may vary from one site to the next, the reports almostalways as far as we have seen contain statistics on the four categories of data shown in Figure 3numbers of arrivals and abandonment, average service times, CSR utilization, and the distributionof delay in queue. This is hardly surprising  it simply reflects the fact that call centers can beviewed, naturally and usefully, as queueing systems.2.4 Call Centers as Queueing SystemsFigure 4 is an operational scheme of a simple call center. In it, the relationship between call centersand queueing systems is clearly seen.The call center depicted in the figure has the following setup. A set of k trunk lines connectscalls to the center. There are w  k work stations, often referred to as seats, at which a group of10retrialsarrivalsabandonqueuebusylost callsretrialslost calls returnsN  3 CSRservers5  k  N places in queuew  5 work stationsk  8 trunk lines not visibleCallcenter hardware Queueing model parametersFigure 4 Operational Scheme of a Simple Call Center adapted from 95N  w agents serve incoming calls. An arriving call that finds all k trunk lines occupied receivesa busy signal and is blocked from entering the system. Otherwise it is connected to the call centerand occupies one of the free lines. If fewer than N agents are busy, the call is put immediatelyinto service. If it finds more than N but fewer than k calls in the system, the arriving call waits inqueue for an agent to become available. Customers who become impatient hang up, or abandon,before being served. For the callers that wait and are ultimately helped by a CSR, the servicediscipline is firstcome, firstserved.Once a call exits the system it releases the resources it used  trunk line, work station, agent and these resources again become available to arriving calls. A fraction of calls that do not receiveservice become retrials that attempt to reenter service. The remaining blocked and abandoned callsare lost. Finally, served customers may also return to the system. Returns may be for additionalservices that generate new revenue, and as such may be regarded as good, or they may be inresponse to problems with the original service, in which case they may be viewed as bad.Thus, the number of trunk lines k acts as an upper bound on the number of calls that can be inthe system, either waiting or being served, at one time. Similarly, the number of CSRs taking calls,N  w, provides an upper bound on the number of calls that can be in service simultaneously.Over the course of the day, callcenter managers can and do dynamically change the number ofworking CSRs to track the load of arriving calls.Less frequently, if equipped with the proper technology, managers also vary the number of activetrunk lines k. For example, a smaller k in peak hours reduces abandonment rates and waiting aswell as the associated 1800 costs, to be discussed later this advantage can be traded off againstthe increase in busy signals.For any fixed N , one can construct an associated queueing model in which callers are customers,11the N CSRs are servers, and the queue consists of callers that await service by CSRs. When Nchanges, k  N, the number of spaces in queue, changes as well. As in Figure 3, model primitives for this system would include statistics for the arrival, abandonment, and service processes.Fundamental model outputs would include the longrun fraction of customers abandoning, thesteadystate distribution of delay in queue, and the longrun fraction of time that servers are busy.In fact, these types of queueing models are used extensively in the management of call centers.The simplest and mostwidely used model is that of an MMN queue, also known in callcentercircles as Erlang C, which we later describe in more detail. For many applications, however, themodel is an oversimplification. Just looking at Figure 4, one sees that the Erlang C model ignoresbusy signals, customer impatience, and services that span multiple visits.In practice, the service process sketched above is often much more complicated. For example, theincorporation of an IVR, with which customers interact prior to joining the agents queue, createstwo stations in tandem an IVR followed by CSRs. The inclusion of a centralized informationsystem adds a resource whose capacity is shared by the set of active CSRs, as well as by otherswhom may not even be in the call center. The picture becomes far more complex if one considersmultiple teams of specialized or crosstrained agents that are geographically dispersed over several,interconnected call centers, and who are faced with timevarying loads of calls from multiple typesof customers.2.5 Service QualityService quality is a complex and important topic that is closely related to the understanding ofCSR and customer behavior, and we return to these subjects in Section 7. Here, we briefly reviewthree notions of service quality that are most commonly tracked and managed by call centers.The first view of quality regards the accessibility of agents. Typical questions are, How long didcustomers have to wait to speak to an agent How many abandoned the queue before being servedThis type of quality is measured via ACD and related reports, described above, and queueingmodels are used to manage it. In this article, we concern ourselves with problems associated withcapacity management, and our emphasis will be on measures of accessibility.The second view is of the effectiveness of service encounters, and it parallels the notion ofrework in the manufacturing literature. The question here is Did the service encounter completelyresolve the customers problem, or was additional work required Among call centers in the U.S.,a call without rework is sometimes referred to as one and done. This type of quality is typicallymeasured by sampling inspection agent calls are listened to at random  either live or on tape and they are judged as requiring rework or not. To our knowledge, there do not exist widespread,formalized schemes for managing service effectiveness.The last type of quality that is consistently monitored is that of the content of the CSRsinteractions with customers. Typical questions concern the CSRs input to the encounter andinclude, Did the CSR use the customers name Did she speak to the customer with a smile inhis or her voice Did the CSR manage the flow of the conversation in the prescribed manner Aswith the question of one and done, answers to these questions are found by listening to a randomsample of each CSRs calls. Sometimes the output of interactions is tracked, and the question Wasthe customer satisfied is asked. Customer satisfaction data are typically collected via surveys.Of course, the notion of the quality of the customers experiences extends beyond their inter12action with CSRs. For example, it critically includes the time spent waiting on hold, in queue.In particular, we note that the nature of the time customers spend waiting on hold, in a telequeue, is fundamentally different than that spent in a physical queue, at a bank or a supermarketcheckout line, for example. Customers do not see others waiting and need not be aware of theirprogress if the call center does not provide the information. As Cleveland and Mayben 46 pointout, customers that join a physical queue may start out unhappy  when they see the length of thequeue which they have joined  and become progressively happier as they move up in line. Forexperimental evidence of this effect, see Carmon and Kahneman 40. In contrast, customers thatjoin a telequeue may be optimistic initially  because they do not realize how long they will beon hold  and become progressively more irritated as they wait. Indeed, call centers that informonhold callers of their expected delays can be thought of as trying to make the telequeueingexperience more like that of a physical queue.3 A Base Example Homogeneous Customers and AgentsIn this section we use a baseline example to describe the standard operational models that areused to manage capacity. We begin in 3.1 with background on capacity management in callcenters. Then in 3.2 we define a hierarchy of capacity management problems, as well as theanalytical models that are often used to solve them queueing performance models for lowlevelstaffing decisions mathematical programming models for intermediatelevel personnel schedulingand longterm planning models for hiring and training. In 3.33.4 we describe standard practicesin callcenter forecasting. Finally, 3.5 offers a qualitative discussion of longerterm problems insystem design.3.1 Background on Capacity ManagementHigher utilization rates imply longer delays in queue, and in managing capacity, call centers tradeoff resource utilization with accessibility. This tradeoff is central to the daytoday operations ofcall centers and to the workforce management WFM software tools that are used to support them.It is also the concern of much of the research that is discussed in later sections.In some cases, revenues or costs can be directly associated with system performance. One canthen seek to maximize expected profits or to minimize expected costs. For example, call centersthat use tollfree services pay outofpocket for the time their customers spend waiting, and these1800 costs grow roughly linearly with the average number in queue a call center that is open24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and averages 40 calls in queue will pay about 1 million peryear in queueing expenses when the cost per minute per call is 0.05. Similarly, ordertakingbusinesses can sometimes estimate the opportunity cost of lost sales due to blocking busy signalsor abandonment. For example, see Andrews and Parsons 9 and Aksin and Harker 5.More typically, however, call center goals are formulated as the provision of a given level ofaccessibility, subject to a specified budget constraint. Common practice is that upper managementdecides on the desired service level and then call center managers are called on to defend theirbudget. See Borst et al. 28 for a discussion of the constraint satisfaction and cost minimizationapproaches.13Furthermore, call center managers view of system capacity most often focuses on agents. CSRsalaries typically account for 6070 of the total operating costs, and managers presume that otherresources, such as information systems, are not bottlenecks. While centers often do maintain extrahardware capacity, such as workstations, Aksin and Harker 4, 5 show that planning models thatdo not account for other bottlenecks, when they exist, could be a problem.We next introduce a base case example that reflects the capacity planning approach used bymost call centers. We note that the example does not represent the state of the art or, for thatmatter, best practice. It does, however, give a sense of the state of common practice. Furthermore,the description of the example  and its inherent problems and limitations  will provide a frameworkby which we will organize our subsequent discussion of callcenter research.The subsection is divided into three parts. We begin by describing, from the bottom up, ahierarchy of capacityplanning problems introduced formally already in Buffa et al. 39. We thendescribe forecasting and estimation procedures which are commonly used to determine inputs tothe capacityplanning process. Finally, we sketch how the elements are put together within thecontext of the call centers daytoday operations.3.2 Capacity Planning HierarchyConsider the call center whose statistics are reported in Figure 3. One sees that the pattern ofarrivals and service times the center experiences is changing over the course of the day. Offered callsper half hour peak from 11001130am, dip over lunch, and then peak again, from 230300pm.Average handle times also appear to change significantly from one half hour to the next.Indeed, in most call centers, the arrival rate and mix of calls entering the system vary over time.Over short periods of time, minutebyminute for example, there is significant stochastic variabilityin the number of arriving calls. Over longer periods of time  the course of the day, the days ofthe week or month, the months of the year  there also can be predictable variability, such as theseasonal patterns that arriving calls follow. See Figure 5. For more on various types of uncertainty,see Section 6.2.Because servicecapacity cannot be inventoried, managers vary the number of available CSRsto track the predictable variations in the arrival rates of calls. In this manner, they attempt tomeet demand for service at a low cost, yet with an acceptable delay. In turn, capacityplanningnaturally takes place from the bottom, up queueing models determine how many CSRs must beavailable to serve calls over a given halfhour or hour scheduling models determine when duringthe week or month each CSR will work hiring models determine the number of CSRs to hire andtrain each month or quarter of the year.At the lowest level of the hierarchy, the arrival times of individual calls are not predictablelower right panel of Figure 5. Here, common practice uses the MMN Erlang C queueingmodel to estimate stationary system performance of short  halfhour or hour  intervals. In doingso, the call center implicitly assumes constant arrival and service rates, as well as a system whichachieves a steady state quickly within each interval. Furthermore, the arrival process is assumed tobe Poisson, service times are assumed to be exponentially distributed and independent of each otheras well as everything else in the system, and the service discipline is assumed to be firstcome,firstserved. Blocking, abandonment, and retrials are ignored.Given these assumptions, the Erlang C formula see 3 below allows for straightforward cal14each month of the year each day of the montheach hour of the day each minute of the hourNumber of calls arriving Figure 5 A Hierarchical View of Arrival Rates adapted from 112, following 39culation of the stationary distribution of the delay of a call arriving to the system. This and othersteady state performance measures are used to make the capacityaccessibility tradeoff.The calculations begin as follows. Let i be the arrival rate for 30minute interval i. Similarly,let ESi and i  ESi1 be the expected service time and service rate for the interval. ThendefineRi4 ii  iESi 1to be the offered load andi4 iNi  RiN 2to be the associated average system utilization or occupancy also called traffic intensity. Notethat Ri, often dubbed the number of offered Erlangs, is a unitless quantity. That is, over half houri, an average of Ri units of service time is offered to the call center per unit of time, and CSRs arebusy an average of i  100 of the time.Given the Erlang Cs noblocking and noabandonment assumptions, at least Ri CSRs arerequired to work for a half hour to serve this expected load. Furthermore, N must be strictlygreater than Ri, equivalently i  1, for the system to have a steadystate. In this case, theErlang C formulaCN,Ri4 1N1m0Rimm  N1m0Rimm RiNN 11RiN3defines the steadystate probability that all N CSRs are busy.The application of the Poisson arrivals see time averages PASTA 162 property then allowsus to obtain our first measure of system accessibility, the fraction of arriving customers that must15wait to be servedPWait  0  CN,Ri . 4In turn, given the event that an arriving customer must wait, the conditional delay in queue is exponentially distributed with mean Nii1, and additional steadystate measures of accessibilityare straightforward to calculateASA4 EWait  PWait  0  EWait Wait  0 CN,Ri 1N 1i 11 i, 5the average waiting time before being served, andTSF4 PWait  T  1  PWait  0  PWait  T Wait  0 1  CN,Ri  eNi1iT , 6the fraction of customers that wait no more than T units of time, for some T that defines thedesired telephone service factor. All three stationary measures are monotone in N  PWait  0decreasing, ASA decreasing, and TSF increasing.Figure 6 depicts the empirical relationship between ASA and system occupancy, , at a relativelysmall call center, analyzed in Brown et al. 36. The cloud of points in the figures left panel plotsthe result for each of 3,867 hourly intervals that the call center was open during 1999. The rightpanel highlights the relationship between ASA and  by furthering averaging the occupancies andASAs of adjacent points.

See Section 4. Yet it is almost never tracked by call center management.Rather, call centers typically choose ASA or TSF as the standard used for determining staffinglevels. For example, a call center might define ASA to be an upper bound on the acceptable16average delay of arriving calls. Then the monotonicity of ASA with respect to N is used to findthe minimum number of agents required to meet the servicelevel standardNi  minN  w  ASA  ASA . 7Over relatively long time intervals, variations in arrival rates become more predictable. Forexample, the fluctuations shown in the lower left and upper right panels of Figure 5 are fairlytypical patterns of arrivals over the course of the day and month. Common practice assumes thatthese fluctuations are completely predictable.Point forecasts for system parameters are then inputs to the next level up in the planninghierarchy, staff scheduling. More specifically, each half hour intervals forecasted i and i give riseto a target staffing level for the period, Ni. For a call center that is open twenty four hours a day,seven days a week, repeated use of the Erlang C model will produce 1,440 Nis in a 30day month.The vector of Nis becomes the input to the scheduling model.We distinguish between two elements of the scheduling process, shifts and schedules. A shift denotes a set of halfhour intervals during which a CSR works over the course of the day. A schedule isa set of daily shifts to which an employee is assigned over the course of a week or month. Bothshifts and schedules are often restricted by union rules or other legal requirements and can bequite complex. For example, a feasible shift may start on the halfhour, last 9 hours, includingan hour total of break time. One half hour of this break must be devoted to lunch, which mustbegin sometime between two and three hours after the shift begins, and the other to a morning orafternoon pause. A feasible schedule may require an employee to work five, 9hour shifts each weekof the month, on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday. Another may require a CSR towork a different set of shifts each week of the month.Now, suppose there is a collection of j  1, . . . , J , feasible schedules to which employees maybe assigned and that the monthly cost of assigning an agent to schedule j equals cj . This costincludes wage differentials and overtime costs that are driven by schedule assignments it need notinclude regular wage and benefit costs that do not change with the schedule. Then determinationof an optimal set of schedules can be described as the solution to an integer program IP. Giveni  1, . . . , I, halfhour intervals during the planning horizon we define the I  J matrix A  aij ,whereaij 1, if an agent working according to schedule j is available to take calls during interval i0, otherwise.8Figure 7 shows the complete Amatrix for schedules that cover one 11hour day for simplicity,rather than 30days. To enhance readability, only the matrixs ones are shown, not the zeros. Eachof the 22 rows represents a different 12hour interval, and each of the 10 columns represents adifferent schedule to which employees may be assigned. Inspection reveals that the first 5 columnsall have the same structure the only difference among them is the time that an employee assignedto the schedule would start. Similarly, the second set of 5 columns share the same structure. Everyone of the 10 schedules has an employee take calls for 7 hours of a 9 hour day.Letting the decision variables xj , j  1, . . . , J , represent the numbers of agents assigned tothe various schedules, and letting Ni, i  1, . . . , I denote the halfhourly staffing requirementsdetermined via 7, one solvesmincx  Ax  N  x  0 x integer 917time j  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10800829am i   1 1 1830859 2 1 1 1 1900929 3 1 1 1 1 1 1930959 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 110001029 5 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 110301059 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 111001129 7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 111301159 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 112001229pm 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 112301259 10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1100129 11 1 1 1 1 1 1130159 12 1 1 1 1 1 1200229 13 1 1 1 1 1 1230259 14 1 1 1 1 1 1 1300329 15 1 1 1 1 1 1 1330359 16 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1400429 17 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1430459 18 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1500529 19 1 1 1 1 1 1530559 20 1 1 1 1 1 1600629 21 1 1 1 1630659 22 1 1Figure 7 An Example AMatrix for the Scheduling Problemto find a leastcost set of schedules. That is, the optimal solution to 9 defines the number of CSRsto assign to each monthly schedule, j, subject to the lower bounds on available CSRs imposed bythe servicelevel constraint. This formulation can become quite large  with thousands of time slotsrows and feasible schedules columns  in which case it cannot be solved to optimality. For callcenters in whichiNi is large, the rounded up solution of a linear programming relaxation mayperform well, however see Mandelbaum and Ruszczynski 111.In practice, the formulation of the scheduling problem may differ somewhat from 9. Onealternative is to impose an aggregate servicelevel constraint for a longer period of time, such asa day, rather than one for each halfhour or hour see Koole and van der Sluis 96. Another isto minimize the deviation between the recommended staffing levels, Ni, and the actual staffinglevels obtained from the assigned schedules see Buffa et al. 39. Both of these alternatives reduceoverall staffing levels, in effect by relaxing the servicelevel constraints.Furthermore, a solution to 9 defines only how many agents are assigned to the various schedules, not necessarily which person works on what schedule. For large call centers, the final assignment of employees to schedules is an even more complex problem for which even feasible solutionsare difficult to construct. Here, heuristics are often used. One common method ranks employeesby job tenure or seniority and allows higherranking employees to choose their schedules first.Figure 8 shows how the number of busy CSRs tracks the arrival of work at a fairly largevirtual call center, under study by Brown et al. 37. Note that, although call centers WFMsystems typically schedule CSRs to start working every 15 or 30 minutes, the figure shows thenumber of busy CSRs closely tracking the offered load in the morning. This may be due to one oftwo factors, or perhaps a combination of the two either additional CSRs log into the ACD every18few minutes in the morning, as the arrival rate grows or there exist additional underutilizedCSRs who are available to take calls, but do not show up in the chart, because they never takecalls. Note also the system overcapacity during the peak of the day, an interval over which thecenter operates at about 80 utilization. We believe that this relatively low occupancy is due to askillsbased routing scheme in which specialized CSRs are prohibited from taking regular calls andare, hence, underutilized.Figure 8 The Numbers of CSRs Working Tracks the Offered Load from 37The solution to 9 also defines the total number of employees required to be assigned to monthlyschedules, 1x. Typically this number is then grossed up  say by a factor   0, 1  to accountfor unplanned breaks, time spent training and in meetings, absenteeism and other factors thatreduce employees productive capacity. For example, statistics, such as On Prod  and Sch Avail in Figure 3, can be used in the estimation of . Thus, the number of agents needed in month tbecomes nt  1x.At the top of the planning hierarchy, a longterm hiring problem is solved to ensure that monthlystaffing requirements are met. The horizon for the hiring problem, T , may be on the order of sixmonths to one year.The gross numbers of employees needed each month over the planning horizon, nt  t 1, . . . , T , are found by solving the scheduling problem 9 and the underlying staffing problems,7 for each month t. Other input data for the hiring problem include the following an estimateof the monthly turnover rate,  and an estimate of the lead time,  , that is required to recruit andtrain a new employee, once the decision to hire has been made.It is worth noting that these latter two factors can be significant. For example in many centersemployee turnover exceeds 50 per year hiring and training lead times can be two or three months,or more.19Given these data, a simple method of addressing the longterm problem that we have seen is tomyopically hire enough new employees so that, by the time they are trained, the projected numberof employees on hand meets or exceeds the projected requirements. More formally, suppose ytemployees are on hand at the start of month t and that, due to previous months hiring decisions,yj employees will start working in months j  t 1, . . . , t   1. Then the number, zt, to hire inmonth t iszt nt  t1jtyj1 jt , 10so that yt  zt t1jt yj  nt . Here, the terms within the summation account for theafterturnover numbers of employees on hand at t  , before the hiring decision at t is made. Byhiring the difference between nt and that total, 10 assumes that no turnover occurs amongemployees during recruitment and training.3.3 ForecastingThe hierarchy of capacity planning models, described above, requires the following inputs arrivalrates i, service rates i, productivity factor , turnover rate , and lead time  . Much of the datarequired to build estimates for these parameters come from ACD reports, such as that shown inFigure 3. For example, the Rcvd and AHT columns of the report state actual arrival rates andaverage service times for each halfhour of the day.The sources of the other data vary. WFM systems sometimes track productivity figures foremployees, such as Figure 3s On Prod , through the ACD. Employee turnover rates, hiring leadtimes, and training requirements are clearly not captured by ACD systems, however. These dataare collected from employee records by the call centers human resources HR department.Arrival rates are often forecast on a topdown basis. The process begins by aggregating thereported number of calls arriving each half hour into monthly totals, such as those found in theupperleft of Figure 5. These totals are the historical basis of forecasts that are to be built on acombination of simple timeseries methods, such as exponential smoothing, and managerial opinionregarding what will happen to the business that the call center supports. For an early book onexponential smoothing see Brown 35 for a recent one see Makridakis et al. 102. The result isa monthbymonth forecast of call volumes.Once these toplevel forecasts are set, the monthly totals are then allocated by dayofweekand dayofmonth, as well as by time of day. See the upperright and lowerleft of Figure 5. Forexample, it may be assumed that 20 of Julys calls are handled in the first week of the month andMondays account for 27 of each weeks total volume. Similarly, each halfhour may be allocateda fixed percentage of a days total call volume.Common callcenter practice is then to assume constant arrival rates over individual half hoursor hours. Such an approximation, by a piecewise constant arrivalrate function, allows one to usestandard, steadystate models. This is reasonable if steady state is achieved relatively quickly,in particular when the event rate   N in an MMN queue is large when compared to theduration of the interval, and when predictable factors that drive the rates are relatively stable overthe interval.In addition to using dayofweek and dayofmonth allocations, managers may flag certain days20as special and increase or decrease anticipated call volumes accordingly. For example, suppose July4th falls on Tuesday. Then the anticipated volume for the 4th may be adjusted down, below normal.Conversely, the volume for the 5th may be adjusted upward, in anticipation of customers who puttheir calls off from the 4th to the 5th. Again, these adjustments are made using a combination ofdataanalysis and experiencebased judgment.In theory, the halfhourly ACD records of average service times could also be used to generatedetailed forecasts of is. In practice, however, many call centers do not forecast service times orother parameters in detail. Instead, grand averages for historical service rates, productivity rates,and turnover rates are calculated.For capacityplanning purposes, the parameters , , and  are often assumed to be objectsof managerial control, and how they are set is the result of negotiation. For example, uppermanagement may assign callcenter managers an objective of reducing employee turnover rates by3 or of reducing average handle times by 5 seconds.3.4 The Forecasting and Planning CycleIn most call centers there is a planner that is responsible for agent rosters. Every week or everyfew weeks, this person begins preparing a forecast for the specified period. Based on this forecast,required numbers of CSRs are determined and, together with agent and management input concerning days off, meetings, etc., a roster is determined. This process is very often supported byWFM software, whose core function is to forecast arrival rates and average service times and thensolve 7 and 9. These WFM packages allow call center planners and managers to refine andredefine their operating plans.The establishment of an initial agent roster is not yet the end of story, however. Forecastsare continually updated and changes are made to roster until the scheduled day itself. When theroster is executed, a supervisor is responsible for service levels and CSR productivity. He or shemonitors abandonment rates and waiting times and changes agents deployments, based on realtime operating conditions. During the day, data are fed back into the workforce management tool,forecasts are updated, and the process repeats itself.3.5 LongerTerm Issues of System DesignBeyond workforce management, more strategic decisions concern the design of the service processand system. Often, HR planning and the use of technology are tied together through service processdesign.In the case of a single call center with universal flexible agents, these issues can be easilyillustrated. For example, such a call center may attempt to reduce HR costs by having more callsresolved in its IVR. In this case, additional IVR resources may need to be purchased, and the IVRsmust be programmed to handle the newly added service. At the same time, the expected changein CSR load must be estimated the fraction of customers that decides to selfserve using the IVRcauses arrival rates to decline the elimination of these calls from the original mix causes the averageservice time to change as well. The changes then flow through the staffing models described above,and an estimated reduction in CSR head count may be made. Thus, investment in the IVR istraded off against HR savings.21Newer technology expands the possibilities for callcenter design, and it also makes the taskof evaluating and implementing the options more complex. For example, consider how IVRs andskillsbased routing makes the use of parttime CSRs become economically attractive. In general,parttimers are valuable because they may work only during the daily peak in arriving calls,thereby reducing the number of fulltime agents that are paid but not well utilized at othertimes of the day. CSR training is expensive, however, and turnover among parttime employees ishigh. To make costeffective use of the parttimers, their training may need to be reduced. Thisimplies that they will be able to serve only a subset of the calls handled by the center. To identifywhich incoming calls can be handled by parttime CSRs, the IVR is programmed so that customersidentify the type of service they desire. To make sure that only simple calls are routed to parttimeCSRs, the center invests in skillsbased routing.Interestingly, while skillsbased routing allows for more efficient use of CSR resources, manycall centers also see the technology as a means for reducing employee turnover. The idea expandson the use of parttime workers described above. A set of skills is designed to act as a career pathas agents learn new skills they move up the ladder. This, in turn, is hoped to improve employeemotivation and morale and to reduce job burnout and turnover.4 Research within the BaseExample FrameworkIn this section we review research that bears directly on the capacityplanning problems describedin Section 2. As such, it reflects the stateofthe art within a narrow context a single type of callis handled by a homogeneous pool of CSRs at a single location. We consider models of multiplecalltypes, CSR skills, and locations in Section 5. Even so, this special case provides a challengingset of problems, and its results offer essential insights into the nature of capacity management inall call centers, simple and complex.In 4.14.4 we cover queueing models used to determine shortterm staffing requirements. Then4.5 reviews research devoted to the problem of scheduling CSRs. Next, 4.6 addresses models forlongterm hiring and training. Finally 4.7 discusses open problems in each of the three areas ofresearch.4.1 HeavyTraffic Limits for Erlang CThe Erlang C model, described in 3.2, has been widely adopted primarily because of its ease ofuse. In particular, there exist simple expressions such as 46 for most performance measures ofinterest. At the same time, the model has notable limitations.Although the Erlang C formula is easily implemented, it is not easy to obtain insight from itsanswers. For example, to find an approximate answer to questions such as how many additionalagents do I need if the arrival rate doubles we have to perform a calculation. An approximationof the Erlang C formula that gives structural insight into this type of question would be of use tobetter understand economies of scale in callcenter operations.ErlangCbased predictions can also turn out highly inaccurate because of violations of underlying assumptions, and these violations are not straightforward to model. For example, nonexponential service times lead one to the MGN queue which, in stark contrast to the MMN22system, is analytically intractable.Thus, approximations are useful both to aid insight and to extend modelling scope, and whenmodelling call centers, the most useful approximations are typically those for heavytraffic regimes those in which agent utilization is high. The heavytraffic assumption naturally reflects thehighly utilized nature of large callcenter operations, particularly the peakhour conditions thatdrive overall system scale.Consider the MGN queue. For small to moderate numbers 1s to 10s of highlyutilizedagents, Kingmans classical Law of Congestion asserts that delay in queue is approximatelyexponential, with mean as given byEWait for MGN   EWait for MMN   1  cs2211see Whitt 152. Here cs  SES denotes the coefficientofvariation of the service time, aunitless quantity that naturally quantifies stochastic variability. When cs  1 and N  1, theapproximation reduces to the wellknown PollaczekKhintchine formula and is exact. Furthermore,the heavytraffic regime assumed by Kingman 91  and, more broadly, traditional heavytrafficanalyses  implies that essentially all customers experience some delay before being served. Forrecent texts on heavy traffic, see Chen and Yao 45 and Whitt 156.Then, given CN,R  1, 11 becomesEWait for MGN  1NES1  1  cs2212From 12 we clearly see that the effect on congestion of both utilization, , and stochastic variability, cs, is nonlinear, in fact increasing convex. Indeed, even small increases in load utilization,, can have an overwhelming, negative effect on highly utilized systems. Performance also deteriorates with longer and more variable service times, ES and cs2, and it improves with increasedparallelism, N .4.1.1 SquareRoot Safety StaffingThe use of Kingmans Law for call centers was advocated by Sze 145, where it was attributedto Lee and Longton 101. Sze was motivated by a traffic mix problem in a call center with thefollowing characteristics. We loosely quote from 145 The problems faced in the Bell Systemsoperator service differ from queueing models in the literature in several ways 1. Server team sizesduring the day are large, often 100300 operators. 2. The target occupancies are high, but are notin the heavy traffic range. While approximations are available for heavy and light traffic systems,our region of interest falls between the two. Typically, 9095 of the operators are occupied duringbusy periods, but because of the large number of servers, only about half of the customers aredelayed.Sze 145 tests a number of asymptotic approximations for MGN systems and, interestingly,favors the approximation 11. This approximation, in particular, identifies exponential servicetimes with any other service time for which cs  1. But, as will be seen later in Figure 14, thisidentification can be inaccurate in the case of many highly utilized servers. Perhaps the conclusionin 145 is due to testing only phasetype servicetime distributions, which allows 11 to be areasonable approximation.23Indeed, for many call centers, N is in the tens or hundreds, rather than ones, and larger Ngives rise to an asymptotic regime that differs from that of Kingmans Law in that significantlymany customers do not wait and service quality is carefully balanced with server efficiency. Forthis reason, we call it a Quality and Efficiency Driven QED operational regime.The QED regime for the MMN queue was first analyzed by Halfin and Whitt 74. Formally,in this regime a service rate  is fixed, as well as a target value   0, 1 for PWait  0. Thus,it is defined as one in which some, but not all, customers wait for service. Then scaling    andN  , Halfin and Whitt demonstratePWait  0   N1 N   13for some fixed service grade   0,, so that N  N  1. They then derive the followingasymptotic expression for the ErlangC formulaPWait  0  P 1 1, 14where   P in 13. Here  and  are, respectively, the distribution and density functions ofthe standard normal distribution mean0, variance1.For a fixed service grade, , 13 suggests a squareroot safetystaffing principle that recommendsthe number of servers N to beN  R  R R , 0    , 15where, again, R   is the offered load. Note that 13 is more precisely equivalent to N R N , but   N , hence the two relationships are essentially the same. See Figure 9.The quantity   R is safety staffing against stochastic variability. Note that   0implies a utilization of 100 or more, hence an unstable system. As  increases, so does the levelof safety staffing. In turn, P  PWait  0 decreases with .Recalling that WaitWait  0 is exponentially distributed with mean N1, one deducesfrom expressions 5,6 and 15 that squareroot safetystaffing with   R obtainsEWait  PWait  0  EWaitWait  0  PWait  0  ES, 16as well as the following simple expression for the distribution of delayPWait  T  PWait  0  eTES . 17While Halfin and Whitts formal analysis did not appear until the early 1980s, folk versionsof this squareroot law have long been recognized. Erlang 51 himself described the squareroot relationship as early as 1924, and he reports that squareroot rules had been in use at the CopenhagenTelephone Company since 1913.Related, infiniteserver heuristics that generate squareroot staffing rules have also been longrecognized see Whitt 151, and the references in Borst et al. 28. In infinite server systems,the number of busy CSRs found by an arriving call has a Poisson distribution, and the heuristicassumes that in large finite systems, this number is nearly Poisson if delays are not prevalent. In24turn, a Poisson random variable with mean R is approximately a normally distributed randomvariable with mean R and standard deviationR. Then, given a target delay probability of , onechooses  in 15 such that  1   .This is justified byPWait  0  PNumber of busy servers  N  PR ZR  R R  . 18Here Z denotes a standard normal random variable, and the PASTA property ensures that PWait 0  PNumber of busy servers  N. For small PWait  0, 1  P1, and the heuristics recommendation essentially matches that of Halfin and Whitt.Borst, Mandelbaum, and Reiman 28 prove that, for a variety of natural delaycost functions,staffing based on the squareroot principle is, in fact, asymptotically optimal for large, heavilyloaded systems. That is, the paper shows that to minimize cost, it is optimal to operate in theQED regime. The same conclusion applies when minimizing staffing levels subject to constraint onperformance measures, which is more common in practice.Squareroot safety staffing turns out to be exceptionally accurate and robust it is tested in 28over all regimes, from very light to very heavy traffic, and it rarely deviates by more than asingle server from the exactly optimal staffing level. The introduction to 28 offers further detailsthrough a set of staffing scenarios.Borst et al. 28 also derives an explicit means of determining the optimal , a problem whichthey term dimensioning. Figure 9 graphs the optimal  for the case in which delay costs andstaffing costs are both linear functions of time. In this case, let r denote the ratio of delay cost perhour to CSR cost per hour. Then, the optimal  can be seen to be growing exceptionally slowlywith rr r1  r2 10  r  10 ,2 lnr2 ln2 lnr210  r  .19From the left chart one sees that for an r of 10, which reflects delay costs that are 10 times thatof staffing costs, the optimal  is about 1.68. For a call center with offered load of R  400, thisimplies that safetystaffing should equal about 34 1.68 400  33.6 and the call center thenoperates at 92.2 400 434 utilization.4.1.2 Operational Regimes, Pooling and Economies of ScaleThe squareroot safetystaffing principle leads to additional insights concerning the nature ofeconomies of scale in the MMN queueing systems. In particular, the analysis in Borst et al. 28gives rise to three asymptotic cases, each of which displays different economies of scale.In the first case, waiting costs of customers dominate the cost of capacity, and the optimalstaffing policy uses an asymptotically fixed utilization rate. Staffing levels grow linearly with theoffered load, and there are no economies of scale. In a large system, the vast majority of callers areserved without delay. This is dubbed a service qualitydriven regime.25Figure 9 Optimal  for Linear Waiting and Staffing Costs from 28An example of such a system is shown in Figure 10, which summarizes the performance of alarge U.S. catalogue retailer. Focus on the peak period of 1000am1100am 765 customers calledservice time is about 3.75 minutes on average, with aftercallwork of 30 seconds and auxiliary workrequiring roughly 5 of CSRs time ASA is about 1 second and only 1 call abandoned after 1second  which seems more like a typo. But there were about 95 agents handling calls, resultingin about 65 utilization  clearly a qualitydriven operation.Another, common example of a qualitydriven regime is in the operation of an IVR. Here,capacity is relatively inexpensive when compared to the cost of CSR assistance. To encouragecustomer selfservice, companies ensure that capacity is ample enough that callers virtually neverencounter congestion.At the other extreme, staffing costs dominate the imputed cost of customer delay. In this case,the number of excess CSRs  beyond the number required to handle the offered load R  isasymptotically fixed in the optimal regime. Thus, as the offered load increases, utilization quicklyapproaches 100 at a rate that equals the number of servers.This is called an efficiencydriven regime. Examples are found in email response and manyhelpdesk operations that offer free service to customers who have recently purchased hardwareor software. In these systems, essentially all customers are delayed in queue, ASA is on the orderof an expected service time, and agents are utilized very close to 100 of the time.In between these two extremes, are call centers that fall within the quality and efficiencydriven QED regime, in which quality and efficiency are carefully balanced. As they grow, thesecenters display both the economies of scale shown in efficiencydriven systems and the high accessibility that is the characteristic of qualitydriven operations.This is the case in Figure 11, which summarizes the performance of 12 call centers, operated bya large U.S. health insurance company one observes a daily average of 31second ASA, 318secondAHT, with 91 agent utilization, in fact over 95 in a couple of the call centers. Note also that2.8 of calling customers abandoned. Customer impatience, however, is beyond the explanatoryscope of Erlang C, and we address it in Subsection 4.2.2.Recall from 13 that the QED regime is characterized by a fraction of delayed customers thatis neither close to zero qualitydriven nor to unity efficiencydriven. Indeed, more refined datafrom the abovementioned health insurance company show that, overall, only about 40 of the26Figure 10 A QualityDriven Call Center from 95customers were delayed, while the other 60 accessed an agent immediately, without any delay.Thus, the callcenter characteristics described by Sze 145 identify the QED regime.Economies of scale are the enabler that allows the QED regime to circumvent the traditionaltradeoff between service level and resource efficiency. To sharpen this insight, we consider the following problem that is commonly addressed by callcenter managers the pooling of geographicallydispersed call centers. This pooling may be achieved either physically  by closing some operationsand expanding others  or virtually  through the use of networking technology that allows callsto be routed to various sites. For this problem we can compare how the different regimes affect theeconomies of scale enabled through pooling.As a first step, we use 1617 to define the following analogues to 56ASA  EWaitES Wait  0  1 , 20andTSF  PWaitES T Wait  0  eT . 21Note that these definitions modify the standard versions of ASA and TSF in two ways they areconditioned on the event that delay is nonzero, and waiting time is measured in units of expected27Figure 11 Performance of 12 Call Centers in the QED Regime from 95service duration, ES. This gives rise to simple expressions that are straightforward to compareacross regimes.We observe that in each of the three regimes, a single measure of system performance is fixed,which then determines the other performance measures in the efficiencydriven regime, excess capacity  and, in turn, ASA and TSF are fixed in the qualitydriven regime, system utilization   RR is held constant and in the QED regime, the service grade  and, in turn, P  PWait  0 are fixed.The above scalings have been formalized in Whitt 155.Now consider the pooling of m statistically identical call centers into a single operation. Eachcall center has the same  and . The arrival rate to the pooled call center is m  , and its is unaltered. Figure 12 summarizes the results. Note that, within each column, the boxed entrieshighlight the performance measures that are fixed under that regimes scaling.Under efficiencydriven staffing, the service grade decreases from  to m, and the delayprobability increases from P  to P m which can be significant even for small ms. Note,however, that ASA and TSF are unchanged. As m  , we observe fast convergence to a systemin which servers are 100 utilized  so that the system behaves as a single server that processes mtimes more quickly  and essentially all customers are delayed.For the qualitydriven system, there is a significant overall improvement of the servicelevelASA decreases to ASAm, TSF decreases to TSFm and the delay probability decreases fromP  to P m. As m  , essentially all customers are served immediately upon arrival.Finally, in the QED regime, the service grade and probability of wait remain constant bydefinition. In contrast, ASA decreases to ASAm, and TSF decreases to TSFm. Note that itis both efficiency driven occupancy increases to 100 and qualitydriven a significant fraction,namely 1 P , of the customers is served immediately.28Economies of ScaleBase case MMN with parameters , , NScenario  m R mRBase Case Efficiencydriven Qualitydriven QEDOffered load R mR mR mRSafety staffing   mmNumber of agents N  R  mR  mR m mR mService grade  Rmm ErlangC  PWait0 P  Pm 1 P m  0 P Occupancy  RR RR  m 1  RR RR  m 1ASA  EWaitES Wait  0 11 ASA1mASAm1mASAmTSF  PWaitES T Wait  0 eT eT  TSF emT  TSFm emT  TSFmFigure 12 Erlang C in the Efficiency, Quality and QED Regimes homework exercise of 1164.2 Busy Signals and AbandonmentThe Erlang C model provides an exceedingly simple means of trading off capacity and accessibility.In turn, its heavytraffic limits provide insight into these tradeoffs that deepen our understanding ofeconomies of scale in call centers and how they should be managed. There are, however, significantlimitations to the Erlang C model.In particular, recall that arriving calls have three ways in which they may exit the system a callthat finds all k trunk lines occupied encounters a busy signal and is blocked a caller that becomesimpatient may abandon the queue before being served and a caller that waits for a CSR is servedand then leaves. The Erlang C model ignores the effect of the first two of these three.4.2.1 Busy Signals Erlang BA call center can eliminate all delays by setting the number of lines to be equal to the numberof agents. In this case the socalled Erlang B formula think B for blocking characterizes theblocking busysignal probability for the associated MMNN system. There are no queues, andaccessibility is measured solely in terms of the fraction of customers that encounter a busy signal.A serendipity is the wellknown insensitivity of the blocking probability with respect to the servicetime distribution. This accommodates general, rather than exponential, servicetime distributionshence MGNN , rather than MMNN.In the QED regime, the Erlang B system displays squareroot results that are analogues to thosefor the Erlang C system. Again, Erlang 51 reports that the Copenhagen Telephone Company had29made use of this relationship as early as 1913, but a formal analysis appears to have been first carriedout by Jagerman 87. He shows that, for large MGNN systems with N  R  R,    , the blocking probability is of order 1N N  P All trunks are busy  .Thus, even in the absence of the ability to queue, accessibility remains high in the QED regime.For   0, the fraction of callers that is blocked in an Erlang B system is small. Furthermore,14 shows that, under the same conditions   0, the fraction is small enough that it would notoverwhelm the system if allowed to queue. Of course, the Erlang C systems infinite space in queuenumber of trunk lines is not practically attainable.In between the Erlang B and Erlang C systems, one trades off blocking with delay the formerdecreases with the available space in queue, while the latter increases. How much queuespaceshould be allowed Feinberg 55 performs a simulation study of an MMNk system whichsystematically varies k  N . The paper argues that a mere 10 excess of lines over agents sufficesfor good performance more lines would give rise to too much waiting fewer, too many busy signals.It turns out that another squareroot principle emerges here, given the offered load and Ngrow as in the QED regime. Letting k  N  bN in such an MMNk queue gives rise to adouble QED regime in which blocking is of the same order as in Jagerman 87, order 1N , butwith a smaller constant. The squareroot principle for queuedimensioning was addressed in 110,and the resulting steadystate distribution is formally characterized in Massey and Wallace 118.Whitt 157 develops process limits for systems that also include abandonment, as well as servicetimes that are mixtures of an exponential distribution and a point mass at zero. In turn, Whitt 158uses these exact results as the basis for a diffusion approximation of GGInk systems.One might think that queue size is unimportant in call centers, that waiting customers are onlylogical entities in a phantom queue. As was already mentioned, however, queue size determinesoverall 1800 delay costs, which can be significant millions of dollars. Furthermore, althoughthe above discussion motivates the tradeoff between busy signals and delays, it fails to acknowledgethe most prevalent outcome of excessive congestion  the buildup of impatience that culminatesin a customer abandoning the telequeue.4.2.2 Abandonment Erlang AAmodel that incorporates both busy signals and abandonment is the socalled MMNkG queue.In this model, patience is defined as the maximal amount of time that the customer is willing towait for service if not served within this time, he or she abandons the telequeue. The Gnotation indicates that patience is generally distributed, i.i.d. over customers and independently ofeverything else. Baccelli and Hebuterne 20 were motivated by telephone services to analyze theperformance of the MMNk  G system. Brandt and Brandt 32 extend the results to covermore general birthanddeath processes in which arrival and service rates may vary from state tostate. It is both remarkable and useful that general patience is amenable to exact analysis.A special case is the MMNk M queue, in which patience is assumed to be exponentiallydistributed. A performance analysis engine for the MMNk  M queue is publicly availableat www.4callcenters.com. The web site includes two tools, iProfiler and Charisma, to supportworkforce management of call centers. iProfiler is available for online use, free of charge. Formathematical details, see Palm 123 and Riordan 130 pages 109112, as well as the more recentGarnett et al. 63, which specifically addresses call centers.30Prevailing practice is to install an ample number of lines, enough so that a busy signal becomesa rare event. In this case, one has an MMNM equivalently, MMNM system, which weshall refer to as Erlang A A for Abandonment, and for the fact that this model interpolatesbetween Erlang B and Erlang C.In analogy to the heavytraffic analysis of Erlang C models 28, 74, Garnett et al. 63 developthree operational regimes for an Erlang A system efficiencydriven, qualitydriven and QED. Asbefore, the regimes are characterized by their delay probability close to 1, close to 0, and within0, 1, respectively. And, as before, the QED regime, with N  R R agents, is robust enoughto cover the full operational spectrum. Here, however, the service grade, , can take both positiveand negative values, since abandonment stabilizes the system at all staffing levels. The operationalcharacteristics of the QED regime are appealing, and they can be summarized as follows serveridleness, ASA and, most importantly, the fraction abandoning are all of order 1N. Theintroduction of 63 is recommended for an informal elaboration. Figure 3 summarizes the dailyperformance of a call center that operates, most of the time, in the QED regime.We now use the Erlang A model to demonstrate mathematically how, in heavily loaded callcenters, customer abandonment behavior significantly affects system performance. Consider Figure3, which in fact details the daily operation of the Charlotte call center that is listed in Figure 11.Note that across busy half hours  for example, from 1000am1130am  the number of agentsworking on production does not vary significantly. At the same time, changes in the offeredload, the numbers of arriving calls and AHTs, are matched by changes in both the ASA andabandonment rate.To get a sense of how abandonment affects performance, we fit the Erlang A model withinindividual halfhour intervals. From Figure 3 we navely use the count of arriving calls and theAHT as estimates of  and . We will discuss estimation in more detail in 6. We round upOn Production FTE to arrive at an approximate N . Then given three out of four parametersfor the MMNM, model, we search for the abandonment rate that roughly generates the ASAand abandonment percentage observed during the half hour.For example, during the period from 1030am1100am, the procedure yields an estimated meantime to abandonment of 30 minutes. Given this estimate, the absence of only 5 agents out of the223 working would likely result in almost a doubling of both the ASA and the fraction abandoning.Interestingly and significantly, a model in which average patience is 30 minutes differs dramatically from a model which does not acknowledge abandonment infinite patience. For thehalfhour 1030am1100am, the latter would give rise to an unstable system in which agents arerequired to be busy more than 100 of their time. Stability could nevertheless be achieved byadding only 2 agents 225 all together, but in this case ASA would be close to 7 minutes  anorder of magnitude error in the predicted performance if one ignores abandonment.Thus, in heavy traffic, even a small fraction of calls that abandons the queue or is blocked canhave a dramatic effect on system performance, and it should be accounted for when determiningminimum staffing levels. For this reason we recommend the use of Erlang A as the standard toreplace the prevalent Erlang C model.Indeed, a common complaint one hears from callcenter managers is that workforce managementsystems consistently recommend overstaffing. While some managers develop an intuitive sense ofhow to adjust staffing levels down, a better approach is to model abandonment in the first place.314.3 TimeVarying Arrival RatesAs is clear from Figures 5 and 8, the arrival rate of calls can change significantly  and predictably throughout the day. The Erlang models C, B, and A, however, assume that arrival ratesand other system parameters are constant. Hence, in practice the models are typically used onlyfor shorter intervals of time, such as 30 minutes, for which the arrival rate is hopefully fairlyconstant. The instantaneous arrival rate, t, is averaged over the desired interval, T , to calculatean interval average,   1T T0 t dt. The average arrival rate is then used to calculate stationaryperformance measures, such as ASA or PWait  0, for the interval.Of course, stationary models often cannot adequately capture the performance of highly timevarying systems. Furthermore, the use of stationary performance measures implicitly assumes thatthe time required for the system to relax is small when compared to the interval for which themeasure is used. This should be the case for systems in which the event rate, N, is large whencompared with the length of the interval, T , typically 30 minutes. But exceptions arise, again, withabrupt changes in the arrival or, for that matter, service rate, or when overload occurs duringone or more intervals. In this case a backlog builds up, and nonstationarity must be accounted for.One method of accommodating timevarying parameters is numerical. Yoo 163 and Ingolfsson et al. 86 investigate exact methods, numerically solving the ChapmanKolmogorov forwardequations for MtMNt systems to calculate the associated transient system behavior. Yoo 163and Ingolfsson and Cabral 85 approximate continuously varying parameters with small, discreteintervals and use the socalled randomization method see Grassmann 65 to explicitly calculatethe change in system occupancy from one small interval to the next.Another natural means of accommodating changes in the arrival rate is to reduce the intervalover which a stationary measure is applied. In the limit, one heuristically applies a stationaryErlang formula for instantaneous t, and as t changes, one calculates a continuously varyingmeasure of accessibility, such as PtWait  0. In turn, one averages the pointwise estimates toapproximate the average performance for the interval 1T T0 PtWait  0 dt. This is the essence ofthe pointwise stationary approximation PSA of Green and Kolesar 67. But the PSA does notexplicitly consider nonstationary behavior that may be induced by abrupt changes in the arrivalrate, and it appears to perform less well in these cases 67. For example, without accounting forabandonment, the PSA does not allow for instances t in which t  N, and such shorttermoverloads can in fact can be designed to occur.Mandelbaum and Massey 104 analyze a singleserver queue with timevarying arrival andservice rates. Formally, theMtMt1 queue. A notable qualitative outcome is that a timevaryingqueue alternates among several phases, the major ones being underloaded or subcritical, overloaded or supercritical and criticallyloaded. Roughly speaking, steadystate analysis applies tounderloaded regimes, and overloaded regimes are well approximated by fluidmodels. Criticallyloaded regimes exhibit, in some sense, the nullrecurrence behavior of a Markov chain and arerather subtly described. The phase transitions of 104 should also apply to multiserver queues inefficiencydriven operations, but this is yet to be verified.Interestingly, allowing the number of servers to increase can simplify things. This is well illustrated in Mandelbaum et al. 107, 108, 109, which model a call center with abandonment andretrials. In these papers, all parameters can vary with time. Then, given fast transitions throughperiods of critical loading, fluid and diffusion limits are derived for the queuelength and waitingtime processes.32Indeed, the fluid models provide excellent fits to the transient behavior of systems that, otherwise, are far beyond the capabilities of exact analysis. Moreover, the models are intuitive andeasy to set up. For example, primitives in 107 are as follows the arrival rate, t a number ntof servers, each processing at rate t the abandonment rate t and the initial queue length Q0.Then the firstorder differential equation,dQtdt t  tminQt, nt tQt nt ,defines the system occupancy Qt as it evolves. A queue with abandonment and retrials is similarlymodelled with two intuitive, autonomous firstorder differential equations.Figure 13 compares the fluid approximation of a system with retrials to actual simulatedsystem performance. In the example, the arrival rate is t  10 per hour at all times except 911am, when it is increased to 110 per hour. All the parameters are constant. In particular ut  1per hour and nt  10 at all times. The figure s circles represent the average number in queue fromthe simulation of a Markovian system with the given parameters. The solid line that runs throughthe circles is the theoretical queue length calculated from the fluid model  truly a remarkable fit.0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 200102030405060708090mbdat  10 on t  9  t  11, 110 on 9  t  11. n  50, mu1  1.0, mu2  0.1, beta  2.0, Pretrial  0timeQ1odeQ2odeQ1simQ2simvariance envelopesFigure 13 Fluid Model of the Transient Behavior of an Overloaded Queue from 107Jennings et al. 89 extend the squareroot staffing principle to account for intertemporal effects,allowing the number of servers to change in response to a timevarying offered load. The schemeis based on infiniteserver approximations, as in Section 4.1.1, and uses results for the MtGqueue, developed by Eick et al. 49, 50. In particular, 89 assumes the number of busy agentsat t is Poissondistributed with mean Et  SeES. Se is the equilibrium distribution of theservice time PSe  t   t0 PS  d. Thus, busy servers lag arriving calls by an equilibriumservicetime distribution.The staffing heuristic then uses a timevarying version of 15 with Rt  Et  SeES, todetermine staffing levels as t varies. In these timevarying models, the appropriate  also varieswith t, and the paper uses the heuristic procedure in 18 for its calculation. Numerical tests in 89show that the procedure performs well under a wide variety of conditions. And indeed, currentwork by Mandelbaum et al. 106 formally justifies the underlying asymptotic scheme.Infiniteserver approximations to timevarying queues have been further analyzed in Massey33and Whitt 120. The paper develops an asymptotic characterization of the time lag between themaximum arrival rate and the maximum number of busy servers, as the arrival changes ever moreslowly. The asymptotic analysis leads to a refined, modified offered load MOL heuristic thatperforms well in numerical tests.The idea that the number of busy servers peak congestion lags the arrival of calls peak loadhas also been used to improve the performance of other approximations. Green and Kolesar 68show that a lagged version of the PSA performs better than a nonlagged version when estimatingpeakhour congestion. Similarly, Green et al. 69, 70 show that using a lagged arrival rate oftensignificantly improves the performance of the original, ErlangCbased staffing models, themselves.Finally, Ingolfsson et al. 84 have recently evaluated the accuracy and computational requirements of a number of approaches, including the exact calculation of the ChapmanKolmogorovforward equations, the method of randomization 65, the infiniteserver approximations of 49, 50,and the MOL approximation of 120. The results show that the method of randomization generallyproduces results that are close to exact with about one third of computational time. Among thequicker but more approximate methods, the MOL tends to outperform the infiniteserver approximation. We believe the latter will continue to prove useful, however, because of its particularlysimple and intuitive nature.4.4 Uncertain Arrival RatesWhile the models described above explicitly represent uncertainty in interarrival times, the overallarrival rate is assumed to be known. As Section 6.3.1 describes in more detail, however, this istypically not the case. Rather, the arrival rate is predicted from historical data and is not knownwith certainty. Whitt 159 call this parameter uncertainty. See Section 6.2.It can be risky to ignore arrivalrate uncertainty, and for call centers that operate in the QEDregime, such as those in Figure 11, the danger is particularly acute. For example, if a call centerplans to operate at 95 utilization and the arrival rate turns out to be 5 higher than planned,either actual system utilization climbs to 99.75  and waiting times explode  or customer abandonment far exceeds plannedfor levels. Given this potential for difficulty, it is natural to increasesafety staffing above the level required by the expected arrival rate. Surprisingly, however, there islittle work devoted to an exploration of how much.Specifically, suppose  is the random arrival rate and let f be an arrivalrate dependent measure of system performance. Typically these measures are nonlinear functions of . For example,given fixed N and , Figure 6 shows the highly convex relationship between ASA and . Commonpractice is to staff so that fE attains the desired level of performance, but the nonlinear natureof f implies that actual performance, Ef, will not match that of the plan and typically willbe worse.To account for this nonlinearity, Chen and Henderson 44 develop simple bounds on EffE for convex and concave f . They then use these bounds to indicate cases in which uncertaintyin the arrival rate is likely to induce significant errors in performance estimation again, typicallyoverpredictions of performance.Ross 132 numerically tests the following heuristic, proposed by Grassmann 66 add thevariance of  to the offered load when determining safety staffing, so that N  R zR var.Here, z is a number of standard deviations derived from an infiniteserver approximation, such as3418. In 132 the heuristic is shown to consistently underestimate the number of CSRs needed toattain a desired service level, and 132 suggests and tests modified versions of the heuristic thatcorrect for the bias.Jongbloed and Koole 90 offer two approaches for setting staffing levels the first assumes thereexists a fixed staffing level to be determined, and the second that a separate pool of flexible workerscan be called in if needed. More specifically, suppose a call center wishes to set an 8020 TSFPWait  20 seconds  80. Given a fixed  and , the call center would simply choose astaffing level, N , to meet the target. If  is random and N and  are fixed, however, then largerrealizations of  imply lower PWait  20 secondss. Therefore, a fixed N will only achieve thedesired TSF a fraction of the time. The papers first approach chooses a target probability, ,with which the call center should meet or exceed the 8020 TSF. Then given this , it calculatesa  such that P    , as well as a staffing level, N, so that the 8020 TSF is met for. N becomes the fixed staffing level. The second approach sets target levels for two pools ofemployees full time CSRs, who work no matter what the realization of  and flexible CSRs, whocan be called in if the realization of  is too large. In this case, the call center chooses two targetprobabilities, 1  2, and two associated arrival rates, 1  2, so that P  i  i, i  1, 2.In turn, the number of fulltime CSRs, N1, is chosen so the 8020 TSF is met for 1. Similarly, N2is set so that the 8020 TSF is met for 2, and the number of callin CSRs becomes N2 N1.The above methods can be naturally combined with squareroot safety staffing. Suppose oneseeks to guarantee a service grade  or one of its analogues with a certain probability, . For thefirst approach, let R   be the associated upper bound on the offered load, with  definedas before. Then to ensure a service grade of  with a probability of  one staffs N  R  RCSRs. For the second, let R1  1 and R2  2, so thatN1  R1R1 andN2  R2R2are the associated staffing levels.4.5 Staff Scheduling and RosteringIn the example presented in Section 3, a twostage process is used to transform halfhourly staffingrequirements into schedules for individual CSRs. First a minimumcost set of schedules is found.Then, individual agents are assigned to various schedules. We now discuss articles devoted to theseproblems.Scheduling Problems The staff scheduling problem 9 is quite general and is tied to call centersonly through the fact that queueing formulae are used to determine the underlying halfhourlystaffing requirements, Ni. In fact, the IP 9 has a history that dates back to Dantzig in the 1950s.For brief histories see 19, 146. It seeks a minimum cost positive, integral linear combinationof the columns of A that covers the requirements defined on the righthandside, N .For this reason 9 is known as a setcovering formulation. Although simple to state, setcoveringformulations can be difficult to solve for problems with many rows time slots and columns feasibleschedules. Our understanding is that, in practice, these scheduling problems are not solved tooptimality. Rather, suboptimal solutions are arrived at via simulated annealing and other heuristicmethods.In particular, it is the presence of breaks in the middle of employee shifts that cause trouble.If every employee were to work consecutive halfhour periods, without breaks, then every columnof the matrix A would have contiguous ones. In this case, the matrix is called totally unimodular35TU. In turn, it is well known that for TU A, the optimal solution of the linear program LPrelaxation of 9 is integral for example, see Nemhauser and Wolsey 122. With the introductionof breaks, however, A is no longer TU, and the LP solution need not be integral.Given that breaks are the source of computational difficulty, a natural heuristic approach is totackle the problem in two stages. In the first step, shifts without breaks  often called tours  aredefined, and an LP is run to find a minimum cost set of tours that cover the staffing requirements.In the second stage, breaks are heuristically placed within tours and additional tours are addedas needed. An example of this procedure can be found in Segal 136, which uses a networkflowformulation in the first stage of the problem.An alternative is to restrict the size of the problem by exogenously limiting the numbers ofcolumns of A that may be considered. This is the approach taken by Henderson and Berry 80 whofirst heuristically select a good subset of columns and then use rounding to make LP relaxationsfeasible.Another approach is to avoid the setcovering formulation 9 all together and look for alternatives that may be easier to solve see Thompson 146. For example, Aykin 19 and Brusco andJacobs 38 define two sets of variables the first defines the starttime and duration of shifts andthe second defines possible break times. Additional constraints are then used to define which breaktimes are feasible for what shifts. For more on these alternative formulations, see the papers andtheir references.Even with these alternative approaches, the solution of scheduling IPs can be computationallyburdensome. When schedules use short intervals  for example, 15 or 30minute periods  andlast for many days, the number of rows time periods grows into the hundreds, and the numberof columns feasible shifts into the thousands 146. Again, in practice one finds solutions viaglobal search heuristics, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms, as well as localsearch techniques.Finally, it is worth noting that the scheduling problem may become easier, rather than harder,for larger call centers. In particular, even though there may be many thousands of feasible schedules, the optimal solution of the LP relaxation of the scheduling IP will only include a smallfraction of them. Some fraction of the rows will have binding constraints, and each binding constraint will correspond to a schedule. Given this fixed set of feasible schedules, larger numbers ofCSRs make the simple rounding up of the LP relaxation more attractive. See Mandelbaum andRuszczynski 111. For example, a 1000CSR call center that uses only 50 feasible schedules wouldadd between 0 to 50 extra CSRs due to rounding. Thats 05 above the infeasible LP lowerbound.Joint Staffing and Scheduling One can also consider the underlying staffing queueing problemtogether with the scheduling problem. For example, any feasible solution to the IP 9 will meetthe minimum staff level Ni in all periods. Furthermore, scheduling constraints make it likely that asolution will strictly exceed Ni in some  perhaps many  periods. In these periods the call centerwill strictly exceed the servicelevel constraint ASA.An alternative formulation of 9 relaxes the intervalbyinterval servicelevel restriction and,instead, seeks a minimum cost set of schedules, subject to an aggregate servicelevel constrainti fi EiWait  ASA, where fi  ij j . A significant complication in this formulation,however, is the fact that the scheduling problem is no longer linear. Nevertheless, Koole and vander Sluis 96 demonstrate that, when the Amatrix 8 is TU, a greedy procedure exists for finding36an optimal sets of schedules.This joint approach to staffing and scheduling also allows for more straightforward inclusionof timevarying arrival rates. Yoo 163, Ingolfsson et al. 86, and Ingolfsson and Cabral 85 alltake this approach. In these papers, a higherlevel scheduling routine proposes potential schedulesfor CSRs, and a lowerlevel servicelevel evaluator then explicitly calculates transient systemperformance for the resulting MtMNt system. The methods of generating highlevel schedulesvary 163 tests greedy heuristics and dynamic programming DP 86, genetic algorithms and85, an IP cuttingplane heuristic. The DP algorithm presented in 163 relies on the stochasticsubmodularity of the occupancy of the GMN system with respect to initial queue size and staffinglevel. This property is formally demonstrated in Fu et al. 57. Finally, Atlason et al. 18 usea scheme in which sample schedules from a highlevel IP are evaluated for feasibility via discreteevent simulation. The approach assumes that the service level is concave with respect to the staffinglevel, and it uses this property as the basis for the systematic introduction of cutting planes in thetoplevel IP. We note that the example problems solved in all of these papers are not large, andthe computational feasibility of at least the current versions of the approach remains unclear.Assignment of CSRs to Schedules Once a set of schedules is determined, an assignment problemmust be solved to match agents and schedules. Call centers with few workers can perform theassignment manually, but operations with 100s or 1000s of CSRs require supporting software. Often call centers use a process called shift bidding to make the assignment. In shift bidding eachemployee first states preferences for various schedules. Then employees are ranked, typically according to seniority, and they are assigned to schedules according to their ranking. Thompson 147describes a case study in which a decision support system is used to automate the process.We are also aware of a call center that posts schedules on a web site and allows employees whoare typically students to choose shifts on a FCFS basis. In this operation, most shifts are takenwithin 10 minutes of posting, which turns the bidding process into essentially a lottery. As aconsequence, some CSRs can go for months without working a shift, a reality that can persist onlywhen agents tolerate volatile schedules.4.6 LongTerm Hiring and TrainingLike the scheduling problem described above, the longerterm problem of deciding how many employees to hire and train is not necessarily tied to call centers, and a number of disciplines haveaddressed problems related to hiring and training. Broadly speaking, this research has focused ontwo fundamental problems with the solution to the hiring problem defined by 10.The first set of work introduces an element of control into 10. That is, rather than myopicallyhiring a minimal number of employees in each period, this work considers minimizing staffing costsover some time horizon and looks for optimal hiring rules. Furthermore, the hiring systems modelledin this stream are much more complex and include attributes such as capacity improvements thatcome with experience multiple stages of learning and training and the ability to hire experiencedemployees.The bulk of the literature that explores these control issues uses a mathematical programmingapproach derived from aggregate planning. Perhaps the first is the seminal work of Holt, Modigliani,Muth and Simon 82. Also well known are a monograph by Grinold and Marshall 71 and a volumeon planning models edited by Charnes, Cooper and Niehaus 42. Aksin 2 uses dual prices from37these types of mathematical programs to account for the appreciation and depreciation inemployee value that comes with experience.The second set of work recognizes that employee advancement and turnover occur at random,when considered at the aggregate level. It thus models the evolution of an operations populationof employees as a stochastic process, mostly Markov Chains. In contrast to the research based onmathematical programming, this work has not typically considered issues of control. Bartholomew,Forbes and McLean 22 provide a comprehensive summary of research in this area.More recent work has sought to combine elements of stochastic modelling and control. Bordoloiand Matsuo 27 derives steadystate performance measures for a heuristic class of linear controlrules. Gans and Zhou 60 develop a DP model of long term hiring that admits a more generalclass of controls. In 60, the lowerlevel scheduling problem 9 is explicitly modelled as the coreof the DPs oneperiod cost function, and optimal hiring policies are characterized as analogues toorderupto policies in the inventory literature. In these policies the current numbers of employeesdetermine an optimal number of new employees to target having on hand. More specifically, if thecurrent number of new employees falls below a threshold, then the difference between the currentand the threshold number of employees is hired if the current number exceeds the threshold, nohiring is done.4.7 Open QuestionsThe research that we have reviewed thus far has addressed capacity management in the simplesetting of a single call center with a single type of calls. As the preceding sections should makeclear, a great deal of progress has been made in understanding how best to manage this base case.Nevertheless, even here there remain significant open questions. Section 4.7.1 describes problemsrelated to lowerlevel queueing models, and Section 4.7.2 outlines questions related to higherlevelscheduling and training.4.7.1 Simple MultiServer Queues in the QED RegimeDimensioning The N  R  R form of the squareroot safetystaffing principle, along with itsinsight into economies of scale, has been well established. For the Erlang C system, Borst et al. 28,also provide a complete analysis of the dimensioning problem of how to determine the economicallyoptimal value of . For all other models, however, work remains to be done.For various other Erlang models, the stationary behavior in the asymptotic QED regime hasbeen characterized. In particular, performance analysis for the Erlang B system can be foundin Jagerman 87, and that for the Erlang A system in Fleming et al. 56 and Garnett et al. 63.Current work by Mandelbaum, Massey and Rider 106 analyzes the timevarying system developedin Jennings et al. 89, work which requires deep mathematics for example, excursion theory.In each of these models, as well as all those surveyed in the sequel, the optimal  is yet to bedetermined.TimeVarying Conditions Recent work on fluid and diffusions approximations, such as that inMandelbaum et al. 107, 108, 109, offer a framework for incorporating both abandonment andnonstationarity, as well as retrial behavior. This approach should also work well for modelling theabrupt overloads that arise from predictable events, such as rushes of calls that are generated by38TV advertising. Fluid approximations may work less well in underloaded situations, however, asargued in Altman, Jimenez, and Koole 6.The employment of squareroot safetystaffing to a timevarying system, as done heuristicallyin 89, gives rise to a QED operation. As Borst et al. 28 suggest, the optimal dimensioning ofsuch a system should also lead to this same regime. The justification of the heuristics and theoptimization of staffing levels are mathematically challenging problems, however. See 106, 109.General Service and Interarrival Times Asymptotic analysis in the QED regime also should beextended to cover nonexponentially distributed service times. This is important practically, as service times in call centers can well be nonexponential 26, 36, 145, and they can affect performancein subtle ways 113.Exact analysis of the performance of systems with general service times is challenging theoretically, however. For general service times, a statedescriptor of the queue must account for the stateof each server and, in the QED limits, the number of servers increases indefinitely. Puhalskii andReiman 128 prove weak convergence for the queue and virtual wait processes of the GIPHNsystem to a complex, multidimensional diffusion process, but not its steady state. Whitt 158characterizes the steadystate behavior of a onedimensional diffusion approximation for GGINksystems.Jelenkovic et al. 88 analyze the GIDN system. The fact that service times are deterministicallows for an especially simple analysis. The reason is that waiting times in GIDN systems arethe same under both FCFS service and the cyclical assignment of servers ideal load balancing,and the latter allows each server to be analyzed individually. For example, the MDN queueis equivalent to an END1 system, which has ErlangN interarrival times the sum of N i.i.d.exponentials. Taking QED limits of a GIDN queue thus amounts to applying the central limittheorem to the interarrival times of a singleserver queue.Simulation experiments of MGIN queues in the QED regime are conducted in Mandelbaumand Schwartz 113. As Figure 14 shows, deterministic service times cut ASA in half, when comparedto the analogous MMN system. This is consistent with conventional heavy traffic 11, asexplained in 88.Surprisingly, lognormally distributed service times, with mean and coefficient of variation bothequal to one, also reduce congestion. This finding runs directly counter to 11, which predicts thesame ASA as in an MMN system or even a worse ASA, taking the heavier tails of the lognormaldistribution into account.The paper 113 takes the notion of heavy tails to the extreme, considering an MGI100 systemwith twovalued service times 1 , with a high probability, and 100 with a small probability, sothat both the mean and variance of the serviceduration equal 1. Conventional heavy traffic resultswould identify the systems performance with that of an MM100 queue, but simulations confirmthat in the QED regime it actually behaves like an MD100 system. The many servers in thiscase render the effect of the service tail negligible.In contrast to service times, general interarrival times present no extra difficulty in the QEDregime, this as long as they are not too heavy tailed. Heavy enough of a tail seems to necessitatea change of scale, to something like N  R  RH , where H  12 depends on the weight of thetail 156. Indeed, Halfin and Whitt 74 already analyze the GIMN queue.Alternative Measures of System Performance To date, most work has concentrated on the min39MD100 MLN100 with CV1 simulated MM100EWqWq0 vs. Beta00.20.40.60.811.20 0.2 0.4 0.6betaEWqWq0PWait0 vs. Beta0.40.50.60.70.80.90 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7betaPWait0Figure 14 Effect of ServiceTime Distribution on ASA and PWait  0 from 113imization of costs that grow linearly or convexly with queue length or delay in queue. Thereare important and emerging cases in which other cost or revenue measures are more appropriate,however. For example, in many 900 telephone services, the service provider earns revenue proportionally to the length of time customers spend on the phone, rather than on a percall basis. Thisdifference may, in fact lead to significant differences in how capacity and calls should be managed.Thus, the QED regime and its accompanying squareroot principal appear to be widely applicable. For many models, however, complete understanding and supporting analysis still remain animportant open avenue for research.4.7.2 Staffing and Hiring modelsHow best to set staffing levels, given uncertain arrival rates, is a problem of great importance. Asalready noted, for call centers that operate in the QED regime, it is no doubt critical. We believethat a complete treatment of the problem needs to model customer abandonment, however.Specifically, suppose there is an arrivalrate forecast, , and that  and N are fixed. Then inmodels which do not account for abandonment, such as the Erlang C, a realization of   Nmakes the system unstable the queue length explodes, and positive increasing cost measures ofthe backlog make no sense  they are infinite. Models that include customer abandonment haveno such problem, however. Even when   N, abandonment stabilizes the system, stationaryqueuelength and delay distributions exist, and one can meaningfully trade off capacity againstmeasures of system accessibility, such as abandonment rate and delay.A second problem of practical importance is the joint determination of staffing levels and schedules. Previous research suggests that, in comparison to the standard procedure  which first setshalfhourly staffing requirements, using 7, and then uses the scheduling IP 9 to determine CSRschedules  the joint approach offers both cost and servicelevel benefits. Work remains to be done,40however, to extend this approach for larger systems. In particular, for higher call volumes, analytical approximations, such as 89, 120, should be of use in the lowerlevel problem of evaluatingservicelevels.Similarly, the practice of first determining CSR schedules, and then assigning particular agentsto schedules, can potentially be improved upon. In reality, not all CSRs are necessarily availablefor every feasible schedule, and the number of agents available for various schedules can greatlyinfluence the types of schedules required.Of course, in theory one would find even better solutions by integrating staffing, shift determination, and assignment problems together. While the integrated problem is likely to be toocomplex to solve to optimality, heuristic approaches may be of value. Even if a combined approachto the three is impractical, work is required to understand which two of the three  staffing andscheduling, or scheduling and assignment  should be combined.Finally, the analysis of hiring models should be extended in at least two directions. First, inmany call centers, additional training and promotions are not automatically granted to all CSRsrather, managers control the numbers of CSRs that advance from one skilllevel to the next. Whilethe ability to control the numbers of advancing CSRs is modelled in some deterministic analyses, itis not accounted for in stochastic analyses, such as that of Gans and Zhou 60. Second, while theDP approach to stochastic hiring models does allow for the characterization of optimal policies, itis nevertheless computationally burdensome. Alternative methods of searching for optimal hireupto numbers need to be developed.5 Routing, Multimedia, and NetworksThe research reviewed in Section 4 addresses a highly simplified setting, one in which a single typeof call arrives to a call center at a single location that handles only inbound calls. In fact, advancesin call center technology expand the possibilities and make capacity management decisions morecomplex in all of these aspects skillsbased routing technology allows for distinctions to be madeamong many types of calls and many skills of servers the growth of email, chat, and webbasedservices expands call centers into multimedia contact centers and networking technology allowsfor multiple locations to be linked into larger, virtual call centers.In this section we describe the new capabilities, and we review a growing body of research thataddresses it. We start in 5.15.1.1 by providing a qualitative discussion of skillsbased routingand associated capacityplanning problems. Then in 5.1.25.1.4 we review queueing research thatapplies to the control of these systems, as well as insights into staffing that some of the modelsprovide. Next, 5.2 provides a qualitative description of problems relating to multimedia and abrief review of recent models in this area. Finally, 5.3 describes new networking technology.5.1 SkillsBased RoutingConsider a call center of a large European company which provides technical support for a productin all major European languages. There are several approaches for staffing the operation.One strategy is to establish a single pool of agents, each of whom is crosstrained to offer servicein all of the languages the center supports. This type of operation is straightforward to manage it41may be viewed as a classical center that handles a single type of call. Labor cost for the requiredmultilingual agents may be exorbitant, however. If the number of languages supported is high, itmay even be impossible to find qualified people.At the other end of the spectrum, one may staff a separate pool of agents for each language. Inthis case, the call center can be regarded as several smaller, independent call centers operating inparallel. The advantage is that one need not hire multilingual agents. From 4.1.2 we know thatthe cost is a loss of economies of scale that a single, large pool of agents would provide.In between, one might partition languages into separate subgroups  for example, French,Italian, and Spanish Dutch, German, and English  and staff these intermediate groups in parallel.Still, this excludes the possibility of hiring agents that do not speak an entire subset, and it doesnot make full use of agents who speak languages beyond a subset.Another, more flexible alternative is to use skillsbased routing. In this scheme, each agentis acknowledged as speaking an individual subset of the languages offered agents identify thelanguages for which they qualify when they log into the system. Arriving calls are then identifiedby language  either through the number called by the customer DNIS or through the customersinteraction with the IVR  and the ACD is programmed to route calls only to qualified agents.Of course, the applications of skillsbased routing reach far beyond the language domain. Forexample, it can be used to route customers with different types of questions to agents with varioussets of expertise or to route highvalue customers to more highly trained agents. Whenever onedefines many types of calls, and agents are heterogenous in the types of calls they can and mayhandle, skillsbased routing becomes a necessity.1 2 3 4 51 2 3 4 5 6types of callspools of CSRsfeasible routingsFigure 15 An Example of SkillsBased RoutingFigure 15 is an example of a system with an elaborate skillsbased routing structure. In it6 types of calls are routed to 5 pools of agents. All agents in a pool can handle the same set ofcalltypes we equivalently say that the agents within a pool have the same skills. Arrows betweencall types and agent pools describe the various pools skills. Dashed arrows at the sides of queuesrepresent customer abandonment. We note that the nomenclature for skillsbased routing has notyet become standardized. For example, one ACD manufacturer refers to customer types as skillsand to agents with the same skills as having the same skillset.42It is important to note that, in addition to call content and agent training, call types and agentskills may be defined according to any of a vast set of attributes. Examples include operationalattributes, such as the forecasted duration of service, and economic attributes, such as how muchan agent is compensated.The majority of advanced ACDs now offer some capability to do skillsbased routing, provided asa menu of options from which managers can choose. But our experience is that skillsbased routingcapabilities are scarcely offered with guidelines on how best to use them. Indeed, the technologyhas raced ahead of managers and academics understanding of how it may best be used, andthe characterization of effective strategies for skillsbased routing poses challenging, unansweredquestions at all levels of the capacityplanning hierarchy described in 3.5.1.1 Capacity Planning under SkillsBased RoutingAt the lowest level, new callrouting problems emerge. When an agent becomes free and one ormore calls for which the agent is qualified is waiting to be served, one must choose which callto attend to first, if any. For an arriving call that finds one or more appropriatelyskilled agentsfree, one must decide to which agent the call should be routed, if any. Often these are respectivelydubbed call selection and agent selection problems.These callrouting problems feed requirements for minimal staffing levels that are a multiskilledanalog to the singleskilled call centers solution of 7. In the singleskilled center, there is onepool of agents, and the minimum number of agents required for interval i is a scalar, Ni. In themultiskilled call center there are many pools of agents. In turn, the minimum number of agentsrequired is a vector in which each element represents the number of agents in a particular pool.Note that there is an extra layer of complexity, however. There is typically more than oneminimal vector of agents that feasibly fulfill the centers service requirements. In a call centerthat serves two types of calls, for example, a certain time interval may require 5 CSRs that canhandle type1 calls and 10 CSRs that can handle type 2 alternatively, 13 CSRs that are crosstrained to handle both calltypes might also suffice. The characterization of feasible staffing inducesa partial order of staffing vectors.Furthermore, the means of determining whether a given fixed vector of agents is or is not feasibleis through the application of a callrouting scheme. Thus, the online control problem of routingcalls, and the offline problems of determining halfhour staffing levels per skill  as well as ofdesigning customer types and server skills  are closely intertwined. In fact, the determination ofsystem stability  whether or not there exists some routing scheme that is capable of keeping upwith arriving work  is not trivial, though it can be arrived at via the solution of an LP 13, 21, 59.The upper levels of the capacity planning hierarchy also become much more complex. In theintermediate scheduling integerprogram 9, each Ni, again, becomes a set of minimal staffingvectors for interval i. A solution to the program is feasible if, in each i, the numbers of agents onhand exceeds at least one of the intervals minimal vectors. Finally, the toplevel problem expandsfrom the consideration of how many employees to hire each period to how many to hire and train.Furthermore, in any period, training may be applied to transform one class of existing employeeinto another.While skillsbased routing affects the entire chain of capacity management activities, researchinto how best to solve skillsbased routing problems is just beginning. Some of the work on long43term hiring described in 3.2 is formulated with multiple skills in mind, but we are not aware of anywork that directly addresses the problem. The state of research into the intermediate schedulingproblem appears to be even less developed we are not aware of any work on staff scheduling thatexplicitly addresses the multiskilled problem we have described.The state of research for the lowerlevel problems of call routing and staffing is somewhat moreadvanced. There exists work that starts to address the problems in a preliminary fashion. In thenext subsections, we review this work and offer a view of future research needs and opportunities.5.1.2 Call Routing and StaffingA standard approach for determining effective routing policies in Markovian queueing systems isvia dynamic programming. The system state represents the servers profiles what types of callsare currently in service by which server skill and the queue profile how many of each type of callis in queue. System controls are rules for routing waiting calls to idle servers at event epochs,namely the times at which a call arrives to the system or completes service. Effective policiessatisfy servicelevel constraints with fewer rather than more CSRs, perhaps also minimizing 1800delay costs. In fact, effective routing policies are likely to be dynamic in that callrouting decisionscritically depend on the current system state.The identification of effective routing policies through DP is often impractical, however. For alarge call center with many types of calls, the dimensionality of the state space is large, making thederivation of structural properties of effective policies difficult, if not impossible. Similarly, the sizeof the state space explodes, so that the application of standard DP techniques to numerically findeffective controls also becomes infeasible. Rather than tackling the realistic problem, as is, researchto date has attempted to reduce complexity in roughly three ways topology simplification, controlsimplification and asymptotic analysis.Topology Simplification The first means of reduction is to consider simple special network topologies, such as those shown in Figure 16. These configurations represent building blocks for morecomplex systems. For example, in a V design a single pool of agents handles two or more typesof calls. In a W design, two pools of agents cater to three types of calls pool 1 serves types 1and 2 and pool 2 serves types 2 and 3.The X design, in which two types of calls can be served by either of two pools of agents,represents full flexibility. It also reflects the fact that skill groups may be defined on a relative,rather than absolute, basis. For example, an Xdesign arises when CSR pool 1 is assigned call type1 as a primary skill, CSR pool 2 is assigned call type 2 as primary, and both pools have theother type of call assigned as secondary. A pool takes secondary skill calls only when deemednecessary say, only if it has idle CSRs and the other pool is congested. In this case, skillsbased routing captures the fact that different calltypetopool assignments have differing perhapsimplicit costs or rewards.It is also important to note that the same network topology can be used quite differently, givenvarious levels of traffic and routing schemes. For example, an N design can be used when type1customers are VIP but there are not enough specialized pool1 CSRs to serve them. In this case,pool2 CSRs can contribute to maintaining an adequate service level for type 1s. Conversely, thesame N design can be used when type2 customers are VIP and pool2 capacity is in excess. Here,acceptable resource efficiency can be maintained by routing type1 calls to idle pool2 CSRs.44I N X W MV1 2 2 2 2 11 1 1 1 3 21 2 2 2 11 1 1 1 32Figure 16 Some Canonical Designs for SkillsBased Routing from 62Garnett and Mandelbaum 62 is an introductory teaching note that lays out the canonicalstructures shown in Figure 16. The paper also uses simulation to demonstrate how various routingpolicies can effect dramatic differences in system performance.Perry and Nilsson 125 consider a Vdesign in which two classes of calls are served by a singlepool of crossedtrained agents. The model represents a single group of operators that providesdirectory assistance, as well as serving tollassist calls. Bhulai and Koole 24 and Gans andZhou 61 also model variants of a Vdesign. Stanford and Grassmann 142, who model a callcenter with monolingual and bilingual CSRs, as well as Shumsky 139, analyze an Ndesign.Control Simplification A second method of simplifying skillsbased routing is to consider moreeasily characterizable, heuristic methods of capacity sizing and routing control. Stanford andGrassmann 142 and Shumsky 139 both consider fixed, static priority policies the former usematrixgeometric methods for performance analysis and staffing and the latter an approximateanalysis. Perry and Nilsson 125 use a scheme, first analyzed by Kleinrock 92, 93, that assignsto each waiting customer an aging factor that grows proportionally to its waiting time. The callselection problem is solved by serving the call with the greatest attained age. The results are usedto determine both the number of agents and the aging factors needed to yield specified expectedwaiting times.Armony and Bambos 14 propose two classes of easily implementable policies, both of whichare shown to be throughput maximizing. In cone policies the space of queue length vectors ispartitioned into geometrical cones, and call routing is determined based on the dynamic position ofthe queuelength vector with respect to these cones. This set of policies includes MaxProduct, inwhich the cones are determined by an inner product maximization, and FastEmpty, in which thecones are constructed based on a linear program whose solution determines the minimal systememptying time. The adaptive discrete review batching policy aggregates jobs into batches andschedules them according to a nearoptimal scheduling rule. The nearoptimality is with respect tothe system emptying time, disregarding future arrivals. This policy can easily account for systempractical considerations. For example, it can tolerate nonnegligible switching transaction timesbetween different tasks without compensating throughput.45Borst and Seri 30 apply more complex heuristics for both the callrouting and the staffinglevelproblems. For a fixed set of agents, they propose a dynamic scheme in which the number of callsof each class that actually has been served is compared to the number that, nominally, should havebeen served under a longrun average allocation scheme. The farther behind the actual numberof services, the higher the resulting priority. Alternatively, in a call center that has servicelevelagreements with various clients, the scheme penalizes those who misbehave, namely those whorequest more service than what had been agreed upon. The paper also determines bounds forthe number of agents required to offer a given level of service it applies the squareroot staffingprinciple to identify a lower bound, and it uses results concerning the achievable performance ofmultiserver systems Federgruen and Groenevelt 54 to produce an upper bound.Finally, consider the following protocol, which is prevalent in practice. Agents are first dividedinto pools, such that all agents within a pool can serve the same types of calls. Call types areassigned fixed priorities and, when an agent becomes available, the callselection problem is solvedby assigning the highest priority call that the agent is qualified to handle. Similarly, for each typeof call, there exists an ordered list of qualified agent pools, and the agentselection problem is solvedby assigning arriving calls to the first pool in the list that has an agent available.We note that, among the criteria used for ranking pools, there exists a notion of dominance.Specifically, suppose the call types that one pool handles are a superset of the those that are handledby another pool. Then the first pool dominates the second pool. In turn, suppose an arriving callcan be served by either of these two pools, and it finds both with idle CSRs. Then the call shouldnot be routed to the dominant pool. Rather, it should be routed to the dominated pool, therebyreserving the more flexible CSRs.To the best of our knowledge, there does not yet exist a general analysis of these fixedpriorityrouting schemes. Nevertheless, there are two sets of results that bear mentioning. First, for theW design Stolyar 144 has shown that, for any static priority scheme, there exist conditions forwhich 1 the static scheme is unstable 2 yet another routing scheme makes the system stable.Second, the static method of agent selection used for arriving calls makes them overflow fromone pool of CSRs to the next. Such overflow problems are notoriously hard to analyze, becausethe interoverflow process is not Poisson. An approximate analysis of performance of this type ofoverflow behavior is performed in Koole and Talim 97.Asymptotic analysis The third approach for simplifying skillsbased routing is asymptotic analysis.The asymptotic regime is heavy traffic, and two such regimes have been considered. The firstis the efficiencydriven regime of conventional heavytraffic, originally proposed by Kingman 91.The second is the QED regime. In the next two subsections, we describe research that analyzesskillsbased routing in each of the two regimes.5.1.3 SkillsBased Routing in the EfficiencyDriven RegimeFor an efficiencydriven operation, one lets the agents utilization approach 100 in a way that, inthe limit, all customers are delayed in queue. The agent selection problem then becomes irrelevant.As one takes limits, the number of agents either remains fixed, in which case the backlog of waitingcalls grows without bound, or it is allowed to increase while controlling ASA, but at a rate slowenough so that the fraction delayed still approaches 100.In these conventional heavytraffic conditions, the results of Gans and van Ryzin 59 imply46that, even though there may be many ways in which arriving calls can be assigned to various poolsof CSRs, one need only consider a small number of possible assignments when minimizing thesystem backlog. Harrison and Lopez 77 further characterize the nature of typeskill matchings orminimal skilloverlaps that make such small sets of assignments most efficient. In particular, theyidentify that, in heavy traffic, efficient sets of assignments enable complete resource pooling CRP,a condition in which the set of CSRs act as a pooled single, virtual super server. Note that allof the designs of Figure 16, except for X, satisfy this CRP condition eliminating any of the fourarrows in X would do as well.This pooling condition is the cornerstone for analysis of efficiencydriven operations, and itseems likely to be relevant in the QED regime. Section 5 of Stolyar 143, which characterizesoptimal policies for a more general resource pooling condition, compactly lays out the relevantliterature. Section 3 and the beginning of Section 5 in Williams 160 have the full story.Harrison and Lopez 77 is the first skillsbasedrouting model that resembles the reality of a callcenter. In 59 both the model, which lists only callcenterwide processing rates, and the measureof system congestion, the minimum time required to work off the entire backlog of waiting calls,are aggregate. In contrast, in 77 the assignment of individual calls to CSRs is explicitly modelled,and occupancy costs are defined as growing linearly with the backlog of each type of call. Both59, 77 consider discretereview policies that process sets of calls in large batches, however. Thisclass of policies is reasonable for emails, for example, but it is clearly inappropriate for inboundcalls.In contrast, for the Ndesign of Figure 16, Bell and Williams 23 prove the asymptotic optimality of threshold controls. More specifically, they assume linear occupancy costs and that type1customers are VIP. They then establish that, whenever the length of the type1 queue exceeds acritical threshold, type1 calls should get priority over type2 calls at CSR pool 2. Williams 160conjectures that dynamic, thresholdbased policies are also asymptotically optimal for the modelin 77. It is important to note, however, that the calculation of the conjectured thresholds requiresprior processing the solution of linear programs that intimately depends on model parametersand topology.An alternative to thresholds is provided by index controls each queue is assigned an index,that depends only that queues state the queue chosen for service is then the one with the highestindex. A striking example is van Mieghems 149 analysis of the Vdesign with a singleserver, whichproves the asymptotic optimality of a simple Generalized c Gc rule for waiting costs that areconvex increasing. By equipping each agent with its own index for call selection, Mandelbaum andStolyar 115 verify that these Gc rules remain asymptotically optimal in the context of skillsbasedrouting.To elaborate, consider a general skillsbased design in which typei calls are served by pooljagents at rate ij . Here ij is the reciprocal of an average service time, and ij  0 if js cannotserve is. Delay costs are quantified in terms of typedependent increasing convex functions Ciwis the cost incurred by a typei customer that spends w units of time in the system. Then each serverj that becomes idle at time t adheres to the following Gc rule choose to serve the longestwaitingi customer for whichi  argmaxiC iWitij . 22Here C i is the derivative of Ci, and Wit is the longest waiting time that of the headoftheline customer in queue i at time t. In 115 it is proved that, under complete resource pooling47as in 77, 160, and for costs with Ci0  C i0  0, the above parsimonious Gc rule isasymptotically optimal in heavy traffic. Qualitatively speaking, the result demonstrates that anexceedingly simple callselection index performs well for system that are efficiencydriven  evenwithin complex routing designs. In these circumstances, agentselection arises infrequently enoughto be handled arbitrarily.We note that quadratic costs recover the aging factor of 92, 93, 125 that is introduced inthe previous subsection. The assumption C i0  0 rules out linear costs, but it is conjecturedin 115 that these can be accommodated by carefully choosing aging factors that vary with systemparameters.The natures of threshold and Gc controls differ fundamentally. Though in certain cases Gcpolicies do generate threshold rules. For example, see van Mieghem 150. The former requirecareful prior calculations of thresholds and management by exception type2 calls get priorityat CSR pool 2 until the number of waiting type1 calls crosses an emergency boundary. Incontrast, Gc rules are simple and robust surprisingly enough, they do not depend even on arrivalrates, but they are based on a continuous reevaluation of the statedependent indices.To summarize, conventional heavy traffic analysis had yielded strikingly simple classes of policiesthat should perform well in efficiencydriven environments. This regime is appropriate for slowerturnaround work, such as emails or faxes, that may be processed after some delay. It is notappropriate for work that must be performed in the quality or QED regimes, however.5.1.4 SkillsBased Routing in the QED RegimeWith the exception of Borst and Seris 30 heuristic use of squareroot laws, research to date onskillsbased routing in the QED regime has been limited to variants of the Vdesign. Given a Vdesign, the QED regime is straightforward to characterize as simply maintaining squareroot safetystaffing. Formally, let i and i denote the arrival and service rates for type i customers, respectively. The offered load is then R iii, and squareroot safety staffing, as before, prescribes anumber of agents N  R  R. The service grade  is arbitrary if there is abandonment andpositive otherwise.Two papers 17, 78 analyze general Vdesigns in the QED regime that it, under squarerootsafety staffing. Being inspired by call centers, both allow for multiple types of impatient customers.Harrison and Zeevi 78 assume a Markovian model with preemption, workconservation noidling when there are customers waiting, and linear costs that are discounted over an infinitehorizon. They identify with the QED limit a diffusion control problem which they solve. Thesolution yields control policies for the original problem that are conjectured to be asymptoticallyoptimal. A twotype example is then solved numerically to concretize the results.In Atar et al. 17, the cost per unit of time can be a nonlinear function of the number of customers waiting to be served in each class, the number actually being served, the abandonment rate,the delay experienced by customers, the number of idling servers, as well as certain combinationsthereof. Service times and impatience clocks are exponentially distributed, but interarrival timesare renewals. In the QED limit, the queueing scheduling problem converges to a diffusion controlproblem. Its solution is used to construct controls that are then proved asymptotically optimal forthe original queueing system.48The analysis yields both qualitative and quantitative insights. For example, it implies that, fornatural cost structures, the advantage of preemption is negligible in the QED regime. Similarlythe benefit of violating workconservation appears to be negligible. Thus, when solving the callselection problem in the QED regime, the ability to idle CSRs need not be considered.Finally, Armony and Maglaras 15, 16 consider a more specific Vdesign in which a single poolof CSRs serves two classes of customers one that opts to queue for service, and another thatelects to be called back by the call center at a later time. The two classes endogenously arisefrom a model of choice behavior. In 15 arriving customers have static, equilibrium estimates ofthe distribution of delay for immediate service, and in 16 customers are given a statedependentestimate of delay. In both cases, the authors demonstrate that a threshold control policy  thatgives priority to waiting customers if and only if the queue of callback customers falls below afixed level  asymptotically minimizes the expected delay for immediate service among all nonidling policies. Furthermore, in 16 they demonstrate that systems that use dynamic estimates ofdelay outperform those that relay on static estimates. Both papers also provide staffing guidelinesthat follow from squareroot laws.It is worth noting that the asymptotic analysis of 17, 78 has so far shed little qualitativelight on the structure of optimal controls for skillsbased routing in the QED regime. This differsfundamentally from the threshold controls of 15, 16 and the index controls of the efficiencydrivenregime 115, 149. QED complexity stems from the absence of complete resource pooling, and thefact that the agent selection problem plays an important role  indeed, the QED characteristic isthat a significant fraction of the customers find idle servers upon arrival.In summary, this is a newlyemerging and important area of research. There is much to achieve,both on the staffing and control fronts.5.2 Call Blending and MultiMediaThe integration of telephony and dataprocessing infrastructure has allowed call centers to expandtheir range and provide additional services. These socalled contact centers have the ability tohandle a wide range of media. Common examples include email and electronic faxes. Other, lesscommon examples include callbacks, in which customers signal  via a companys web site or IVR that they wish to be called back by the center, and chat, in which agents communicate in moreor less real time over the internet with customers, using text.In fact, the latest generation of systems has the potential to route any type of electronicallymediated work. For example, consider a claimsprocessing center for a large U.S. based healthinsurance company. The information system with which CSRs interact, as they handle customerrequests, is the companys claimsprocessing and adjudication system. The telephone and claimssystems are integrated via CTI, and the company has the ability to route both phone calls andscreens of claimsprocessing work to idle CSRs.In one sense, multimedia may be thought of as an example of skillsbased routing. The varioustypes of work  call, email, claimsprocessing screen  parallel various call types. Each agents skillsdefine the types of media she is capable of handling.At other levels, however, differences among media are deeper than differences among calls oneimportant difference is the natural time scales at which the various media must be responded toanother is the discipline required for service yet another is the mental setup required to switch49among media.Typically, telephone calls are to be served within seconds or minutes and, once started, shouldnot be interrupted. Responses to email and fax requests, on the other hand, can be delayed forhours or perhaps days, and they may be preempted and resumed. Response times for chat servicesfall somewhere in between, and CSRs that handle chat may serve several customers at once.Differences in timing naturally lead one to consider priority schemes in which telephone callsreceive high priority and emails and faxes, low. In addition, limits in the structure of shifts andschedules often prompt the solution to the staffing problem 9 to include periods of overcapacityi s.t.j aijxj  Ni. During these intervals, agents that might otherwise be idle can becomeproductive by handling lowpriority work. Historically, the problem first arose in the context ofmixing inbound and outbound calls, a process commonly known as call blending.Thus, contact centers enjoy an advantage over call centers in that slower responsetime trafficcan be shifted between intervals inventoried, and this can help to increase CSR utilization andreduce operating costs. At the same time, blending of traffic of various priorities, subject tomediumspecific servicelevel constraints, creates problems that are akin to those of skillsbasedrouting. Bhulai and Koole 24 and Gans and Zhou 61 address the lowerlevel routing problemgiven a fixed set of CSRs, how to maximize the throughput of lowpriority traffic, for example email,subject to a servicelevel constraint on incoming calls. They demonstrate that variants of thresholdreservation policies, which reserve agents for inbound calls, are effective. Brandt and Brandt 32assume the use of these threshold policies and analyze analogous systems with customers that havegenerally distributed patience. To the best of our knowledge, extensions of higherlevel schedulingand hiring problems have not been tackled in this context.We are aware of three papers that model the use of IVRs and callbacks. Brandt, Brandt, Spahl,and Weber 33 consider a call center with a finite number of lines, customers with exponentialpatience and, prior to waiting, an IVR message of constantduration. The system is modelled as atwodimensional network, and approximations to steady state performance measures are derived.Brandt and Brandt 31 analyzes a birthanddeath model of a system in which callers who havewaited beyond a given threshold are transferred to a callback queue. The callback queue is servedonly when there are no live callers waiting and the number of idle agents exceeds some threshold. This again gives rise to approximate measures of performance of a twodimensional network.Armony and Maglaras 15, 16 model a system in which customers who are not immediately servedmay choose to wait in queue for service, to wait for a later callback, or to balk if they deem bothwaits too long.Finally, Mandelbaum, Massey, and Reiman 105 develop a framework for the analysis of Markovian service networks. In these systems, multiple types of customers are served according topreemptiveresume priority disciplines. The primitives include timevarying abandonment and retrial intensities, and the asymptotics are in the QED regime. This framework is thus applicable forperformance analysis of large multimedia call centers. While the framework does not yet accommodate nonpreemptive priority disciplines or finite buffers busysignals, both features appear tobe within theoretical grasp given the results of Atar et al. 17, the gains from preemption promiseto be negligible in the QED regime and current work by Massey and Wallace 118 addressesfinitebuffer systems.505.3 NetworkingTelephone networking technology allows companies to link geographically dispersed call centers,and through careful management their performance can approach that of a single virtual callcenter. In this manner companies can better exploit potential economies of scale. For example,this is the case in Figure 11, the header of which reads Command Center Intraday Report.Here, load balancing is exercised from a single Command Center that oversees the 12 call centersrepresented in the table.There currently exist several methods for networking call centers, the main variants of whichare summarized in Figure 17. There exist true network ACD systems that have the ability to holdcalls centrally and route individual calls to call centers as agents become free. There also exist lesselaborate load balancing schemes in which calls are routed from a central switch to call centers withtraditional ACDs. Here, calls queue locally, at the individual centers. In overflow systems, callsthat are queued at one call center may be laterally transferred to another, and combinations of theloadbalancing and overflow schemes may also be used.network ACDnetworkcall centersload balancing overflow load balancingand overflowFigure 17 Common Methods of Networking Call CentersIn addition to these main variants there may be many other hybrids. One with which we arefamiliar allows calls to queue simultaneously at more than one center. In this socalled interflowscheme, each call first arrives to an individual center. If it is predicted to be served within a fixedtime limit, say 15 seconds, then the call queues only at that center. If the expected delay is greaterthan the threshold, however, then the call simultaneously queues at the original site, as well as anyother site whose expected delay falls below the expecteddelay threshold possibly none.Figure 18 shows one hours worth of data from a network of four call centers nodes that usethis interflow scheme. Numbers with asterisks indicate the volumes of calls arriving to each of thenodes, as well as each calls final disposition served or abandoned. Numbers on the arrows betweennodes indicate the numbers of calls that were served at a location that differed from the originatingnode. From the figure, one sees that nodes 2 and 4 were not interconnected. One also sees that ofthe 2,092 calls arriving to node 1, for example, less than 1.4 abandoned, and almost 34 wereultimately served at locations 2 and 3.51node 158 267715863438 752063 served29 abandoned1687 served7 abandoned1755 served15 abandoned4 112 served10 abandonednode 2node 3node 4March 19, 2001 10am11amFigure 18 Example Flow of Calls within a Network of Four Call Centers from 37While there is a fairly extensive literature on load balancing, little of it appears to be directlyapplicable to these systems. Servi and Humair 137 analyze the problem of setting static routingprobabilities in load balancing systems. More can be gained if routing is dynamic, and Kogan etal. 94 compare two basic strategies for the dynamic routing of calls the first is a networkACDthat queues calls centrally and routes calls to individual CSRs as they become available at varioussites and the second is a dynamic loadbalancing scheme that immediately routes an arriving callto the site with the least expected delay, at which point the call queues. The paper demonstratesnumerically that, to the extent that a FCFS system imposes a delay in switching calls to centers,it may be inferior to the less elaborate dynamic loadbalancing method. Numerical tests in Borstet al. 29 show that similar dynamic loadbalancing schemes perform well, so that a multiple sitesystem approaches quite closely the performance of a single virtual facility 30.Thus, the growing trend of networking call centers has barely been investigated. In particular,both dynamic load balancing and overflow protocols can  in theory  lead the arrival processesat individual call centers to not be Poisson. Questions of how the assumptions are violated, byhow much, and how this impacts capacity management have yet to be addressed systematically.Because the effect of complex networking protocols are difficult to predict, empirical analysis thatcaptures actual behavior would help to deepen academics and managers understanding of thebenefits and drawbacks of the various networking schemes.6 Data Analysis and ForecastingThe modelling and control of call centers must necessarily start with careful data analysis. Forexample, the simple Erlang C queueing model described in Section 3 requires the estimation of acalling rate i and a mean service time 1i  for each halfhour interval. Moreover, as Figure 3and the accompanying discussion in Section 4.2 indicate, the performance of call centers in peakhours can be extremely sensitive to changes in these underlying parameters.52It follows that accurate estimation and forecasting of parameters are prerequisites for a consistent service level and an efficient operation. Furthermore, given the computermediated, dataintensive environment of modern call centers, one might imagine that highly developed estimationand forecasting methods would exist.But in fact, though there is a vast literature on statistical inference and forecasting, surprisinglylittle has been devoted to stochastic processes, and much less to queueing models in general andcall centers in particular. For example, Section II in 103 lists only 17 papers on the statistics andforecasting of call center data. Indeed, the practice of statistics and time series analysis is still inits infancy in the world of call centers, and serious research efforts are required to bring it up topar with prevalent needs.The scarcity of statistical research of call centers renders this part of our survey more speculative.In 6.16.2 we describe general categories of callcenter data, as well as various statistical approachesthat are useful for their analysis. Then in 6.3 we review data analysis and statistical research thatis related to callcenter operations the analysis of system primitives, such as arrival rates, servicetimes, and abandonment behavior and that of system performance measures, such as waiting timesand aggregate customer abandonment rates. We conclude the section in 6.4 by stating our viewsconcerning data analysis and forecasting work that needs to be done.6.1 Types of Call Center DataRecall from 2.2 the description of how a call is handled. This process generates a great deal of data,which we divide into four categories operational, marketing, human resources, and psychological.Operational data reflect the physical process by which calls are handled. These data are typicallycollected by pieces of the telephone infrastructure such as IVRs and ACDs. They can be usefullyorganized in two, complementary fashions.Operational customer data provide listings of every call handled by a site or network of callcenters. Each record includes timestamps for when the call arrived, when it entered service orabandoned, when it ended service, as well as other identifiers, such as who was the CSR and atwhich location the call was served.Operational agent data provide a momentbymoment history of the time each loggedin agentspent in various system states available to take calls, handling a call, performing wrapup work,and assorted unavailable states. These data allow one to deduce the numbers of agents working atany time. Often these records include identifiers of the calls being served and with difficulty canbe matched to the operational customer data described above, for joint analysis.Marketing or business data are gathered by a companys corporate information system. Theymay include records of the transactions that took place over the customers entire history with thecompany, through call centers as well as through other channels. They may also capture informationconcerning the customers current status at the business.In theory, operational and marketing data can be seamlessly integrated via CTI software, whichconnects the telephone infrastructure with a companys customer databases. That is, given the existence of CTI, one might expect companies to record and analyze a full view of what happens toeach call as it enters the system marketing data concerning what happened during the service, together with operational data concerning how and when the service happened. In practice, however,53the use of CTI appears, thus far, to be limited to facilitating the service process through screenpops which save CSRs time, not to the joint reporting of call data. Incompatibility between datastorage schemes of older ACD and newer CTI systems may be the problem that prevents thisintegration from taking place.Human resources data record the history and profile of agents. Typical data include informationconcerning employees tenure at the company, what training they have received and when, and whattypes of call they are capable of handling. With one frequent exception, these data generally residewithin the records of a companys human resources department. The exception is that of skillsdata, which define the types of calls that agents can handle. This information is needed, by theACD or those that manage it, to support skillsbased routing.Finally, psychological data are collected from surveys of customers, agents or managers. Theyrecord subjective perceptions of the service level and working environment.Two additional sources of data are important to acknowledge. First, some companies recordindividual calls for legal needs e.g., brokerage and insurance businesses or training reasons. Whilepotentially useful, we are not aware of any simple machinery that can extract these data for analysissay, into a spreadsheet. A second source is subjective surveys in which call center managersreport statistics that summarize their operations. These surveys can include both operationaland marketing data, such as arrival and utilization rates, average handle times, and the averagedollar value of a transaction. While they may facilitate rough benchmarking see, for example,www.benchmarkportal.com, these data should be handled with care. By their nature, they arebiased and should not serve as a substitute, or even a proxy, for the operational and marketingdata discussed above.6.2 Types of Data Analysis and Source of Model UncertaintyAs in any statistical work, the analysis of callcenter data can take a number of forms. We brieflymake three sets of distinctions.Descriptive, Explanatory and Theoretical Analysis We first distinguish among descriptive, explanatory, and theoretical analysis. Each mode is important, and we briefly describe the three inturn.1Descriptive models organize and summarize the data being analyzed. The simplest of these aretables or histograms of parameters and performance. An example is a histogram of service durationby service type, or of customers patience by customer type, or of waiting times for those ultimatelyserved.These can be contrasted with theoretical models that seek to test whether or not the phenomenonbeing observed conforms to various mathematical or statistical theories. Examples include theidentification of an arrival process as a Poisson process or of service durations as being exponentiallydistributed.In between descriptive and theoretical models fall explanatory models. These are often createdin the context of regression and time series analysis. Explanatory models go beyond, say, histograms1 Parts of the present section are adapted from the report Mandelbaum, Sakov and Zeltyn 112. This is anindepth empirical analysis, mostly descriptive, of call center operational data, gathered at a small Israeli bank overthe twelve months of 1999. Both the report and the data are downloadable from ie.technion.ac.ilserveng.54by identifying and capturing relationships in terms of explanatory variables. For example, averageservice times of calls may be systematically higher from 11am to 3pm and lower at other periods.At the same time, these models fall short of theoretical models in that there is no attempt todevelop or test a formal, mathematical theory to explain the relationships.Queueing models constitute theoretical models which mathematically define relationships amongbuilding blocks, for example arrivals and services, which we refer to here as primitives. Queueinganalysis of a given model starts with assumptions concerning its primitives and culminates in properties of performance measures, such as the distribution of delay in queue or the abandonment rate.Validation of the model then amounts to a comparison of its primitives and performance measures typically theoretical  against their analogs in a given call center  mostly empirical.For example, theoretical analysis of the GGN queue gives rise to Kingmans law of congestionin heavy traffic, the waiting time of delayed customers is close to being exponentially distributedwith expected delay defined as in 11. Empirical analysis of call centers operating in heavy trafficcan then validate or refute Kingmans law, as in 36 see Figure 6.Estimation versus Prediction We also distinguish between two closely related, but different,statistical tasks estimation and prediction. Estimation concerns the use of existing historicaldata to make inferences about the parameter values of a statistical model. Prediction concerns theuse of the estimated parameters to forecast the behavior of a sample outside of the original dataset used to make the estimate. Predictions are noisier than estimates, because, in additionto uncertainty concerning the estimated parameters, they contain additional sources of potentialerrors.As an example, consider a simple model in which the arrival rate to a call center each day from900am930am is a linear function of the number of customers receiving a promotional mailing.That isi   xi  i , 23where i is the arrival rate, xi is the number of mailings,  and  are unknown constants, andthe i are i.i.d. normallydistributed noise terms with mean zero. Given n sample points xi, i,one may use regression techniques such as least squares to produce parameter estimates  and .There is uncertainty, however, regarding how closely these estimates match the true  and . Thatis  and  are random variables that are functions of the n i.i.d. samples, and given our estimatedfunctioni   xi , 24the associated estimation error is distributed asi  i       xi .Now suppose we are told the number of mailings that customers will receive on day n 1, and weare asked to predict what n1 will be. Then we use n1 to predict the n1st arrival rate, andfrom 2324 we see that the prediction error is distributed asn1  n1       xn1  n1 .In particular, the n1 term makes the prediction error larger than the estimation error that arisesfrom the use of  and . For more on estimation and prediction see, for example, Bickel andDoksum 25, as well as 36.55Sources of Uncertainty Call centers operate in a random environment, and it is useful to classifytheir sources of uncertainty see Whitt 159. For example, exact call arrival times are usually notknown in advance. This inherent randomness is called process uncertainty. In addition to processuncertainty there are two other sources of uncertainty, which may be significant. First, any modelis an approximation of reality, and therefore necessarily misspecifies the underlying phenomenonto some extent. This is called model uncertainty. For example, there can be uncertainty as towhether or not an arrival process is actually Poisson. An important part of data analysis is tostudy model uncertainty. It is equally important to study the influence of model uncertainty onperformance measures. For example, Figure 14 shows that system performance is not insensitive tothe form of the servicetime distribution. Given a model that describes reality satisfactorily, therestill may exist parameter uncertainty, as is the case of a Poisson process with an uncertain rate.These sources of uncertainty are described in more detail in 159.6.3 Models for Operational ParametersFirst we review work devoted to primitives arrivals, service times, abandonment patience andretrials. Then we address the validation of performance measures.6.3.1 Call ArrivalsThe arrival process records the epochs at which calls arrive to the center. Among the queueingprimitives of call centers, it has been studied most extensively. For example, consider the followingthree models for the arrival process of calls to a call center, during a given day.Descriptive models, such as histograms of interarrival times, reflect shortterm patterns of randomness in arrivals. Conversely, more aggregate descriptions of the arrival process, such as thosedeveloped in Mandelbaum, Sakov and Zeltyn 112, may average out stochastic variability overseveral similar days to develop deterministic, fluidlike models that reflect predictable variabilityin the calling rate. For example, the lowerright panel of Figure 5 reveals the stochastic nature ofarrivals in the short term, and the remaining panels highlight predictable variability.Explanatory models can be used to forecast future arrival rates of calls to a call center, a crucialfirst step in the process of scheduling personnel. Arrival rates depend on many factors  day ofweek or month, time of day, holidays, etc.  and statistical techniques using explanatory variablescan be used to represent them. For example, Andrews and Cunningham 7 develop autoregressiveintegrated moving average ARIMA models that estimate the number of daily calls for ordersbuying merchandise and inquiries e.g. checking order status at L.L. Bean. In addition to day ofweek, covariates include the presence of holidays, catalogue mailings, as well as forecasts for ordersthat are independently produced by the companys marketing department.Classical theoretical models posit that arrivals form a Poisson process. It is well known thatsuch a process results from the following behavior there exist many potential, statistically identicalcallers to the call center there is a very small yet nonnegligible probability for each of them callingat any given minute, say, so that the average number of calls arriving within a minute is moderateand callers decide whether or not to call independently of each other. When the average numbersof arrivals change over the time of day then one obtains a timeinhomogeneous Poisson process.Suppose the same seasonal cycle of arrival rates  such as the daily pattern shown in the lower56left panel of Figure 5  repeats itself. Then a common method of estimating the arrival rate is tobreak the cycle into smaller intervals, collect several cycles worth of samples for each subinterval,and use each sample mean as an estimate of that subintervals arrival rate. Henderson 79 performsan asymptotic analysis of this scheme, one in which the length of the subinterval appropriatelyshrinks as the number of cycles worth of data grows. The analysis shows that, when the underlyingarrival process is timeinhomogeneous Poisson and cyclical, the limiting sample rate function is aconsistent estimator of the original arrivalrate function.Massey et al. 119 approximate a general timeinhomogeneous Poisson process as one with apiecewise linear rate function. That is, over intervals 0, T1,. . . ,Ti1, Ti,. . . ,Tn1, Tn, the arrivalprocess is Poisson with rate it  aibi  t. Using simulated arrivals, they compare ordinary leastsquares OLS, weighted least squares WLS, and maximum likelihood ML methods of estimatingai, bi. They find that, given an arrival rate that is a linear Poisson process, all three methodsperform well, as long as ai  0. For ai  0, however, WLS and ML which are asymptoticallyequivalent perform better. They also offer standard tests for validating the linear Poisson model.Of course, forecasts of arrival rates are not exact. Call centers may not always have sufficienthistorical data upon which reliable estimates can be based. Furthermore, unpredictable factors,such as weather conditions, also make future arrival rates uncertain. As Section 4.4 describes,uncertainty in the arrival rates can be dangerous to ignore, particulary for highly utilized callcenters operating in the QED regime. Therefore, it is desirable to develop distributional ratherthan point forecasts.Jongbloed and Koole 90 analyze the numbers of arrivals to a Dutch call center by time of day.For each time interval e.g. 10001030am they collect several days worth of data, and they showthat the data do not appear to be i.i.d. samples of Poisson random variables while the mean andvariance of a Poisson distribution are the same, the samples variances are much larger than theirmeans. Thus, given only timeofday information, the process turns out to be doubly Poisson therate itself is random.The paper 90 goes on to develop parametric GammaPoisson and nonparametric ML methods of estimating a distribution for the unknown arrival rate of a Poisson processes. The Gammadistribution is a convenient prior to use for the arrival rate, since it is a conjugate prior for thePoisson distribution. Gordon and Fowler 64 also address this problem, but in less detail.Brown et al. 36 analyze the arrival process of calls to a relatively small call center in Israel.They confirm that arrivals by call type do correspond to a Poisson process in which the arrivalintensity varies. As in 90, the arrival process appears to be doubly Poisson, however. Indeed,when numbers of arrivals are stratified by time of day and day of week, the samples for specifictimeday pairs e.g. Monday from 1011am do not appear to be i.i.d. samples of Poisson randomvariables.The paper 36 also develops a method for generating prediction as opposed to estimation confidence intervals of a nonstationary arrival rate. The prediction model includes an autoregressiveterm  each days aggregate arrival rate is conditioned on that of the previous period  and theintroduction of the autoregressive element noticeably reduces prediction error. Thus, the arrivalrates are positively serially correlatedThere are also scenarios in which the Poisson assumptions are clearly violated. A simple example occurs when callers react to an external event, such as a telephone number shown in aTV commercial, which can be modelled by adding a Poissondistributed number of arrivals at a57predictable point in time. This is still referred to a Poisson point process, which enjoys a discontinuity in its cumulative arrival rate. Other examples occur when busysignals generate immediateretrials or when the arrivals from one call center overflow to another, for example via centralizedload balancing schemes. In an analogy to Internet traffic, it is conceivable that phenomena such aslongrange dependence, or heavy tails of the interarrival times, would then emerge, but as of yetthere has been no empirical support of these phenomena. For example, see Willinger et al. 161.6.3.2 Service DurationThe service duration is typically defined as the time an agent spends handling a call. This mayinclude time speaking with the customer, time during which the customer is on hold and theagent is processing the customers request, as well as time after the caller hangs up that the agentcontinues processing the request.Work on service times has almost exclusively concentrated on description and validation oftheoretical models for service duration. Thus, there exists published work that presents dataanalysis, such as histograms, as well as tests for goodness of fit with certain parametric familiesof distributions, but little in the way of explanatory work.Furthermore, there does not exist an extensive theory for the distributional form that servicedurations should follow. Mixtures of Erlang distributions are, in fact, dense among all distributions,and this subfamily of phasetype distributions is convenient numerically. For example, see Latoucheand Ramaswami 100. But having ample parameters, they are less convenient theoretically. Tothis end, lowerdimensional parametric models are desired.The most frequently used parametric model of service is that of exponentially distributed durations. In practice, the main theoretical justification for its use has been analytical tractability,along with a lack of empirical evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, some studies have comparedempirical distributions of service durations to exponential distributions and found an acceptablefit. One example is Kort 98, which summarizes models of the Bell System Public Switched Telephone Network, developed in the 70s and 80s. Another is Harris et al. 76, which analyzes IRScall centers. Our experience has frequently confirmed these findings for human services that arehomogeneous and unpaced not only telephone services.In addition to the exponential distribution, two other parametric statistical families have beenfound to arise in applications Erlang, or more generally Gamma, distributions and the lognormaldistribution. Both families are explored in Chlebus 43, who analyzes holding time distributionsin cellular communication systems. Other confirmations for the lognormal fit are provided by theservice times in Bolotin 26 and in Mandelbaum, Sakov and Zeltyn 112, where the fit has beenfound to be truly remarkable right panel of Figure 19. It has also shown up in an unpublishedanalysis of data from the call center of a Dutch bank. The excellent fit of lognormal arises notonly for overall service times. It is also found when service times are stratified by service types, byindividual agents, and so on. Furthermore, Bolotin 26 notes that Webers Law  in which theperceived duration or value of the incremental time spent in an activity remains a fixed proportionof the time already spent  is consistent with the lognormal form of service durations.A comparison of the two histograms in Figure 19 is worth making. Observe that the left panel,which is the empirical distribution of call times from January to October of 1999, has a spike near0 seconds the origin about 7 of the calls were shorter that 10 seconds. These very short calls58Figure 19 ServiceTime Distributions from a Call Center from 112were due to certain agents who were taking small rest breaks by hanging up on customers. Incontrast, the right panel, which reflects only November and December data, shows no such spike.At the end of October, the problem was discovered and corrected.The problem of agents abandoning their calls arises when short service durations or many callsper shift are highlighted as a prime performance objective. The problem becomes immediatelyapparent from callbycall data. It cannot be discovered, however, through the prevalent standardof reporting only halfhour averages.6.3.3 Abandonment and RetrialsA final set of primitives in operational queueing models concerns the behavior of the customerswho are calling to be served. From Figure 4 we recall that these include abandonment, retrials andreturns. Among published papers, most attention has been given to patience and abandonment,with little devoted to the tendency to retry, namely redial, and even less to returns.The Impatience Function A basic description of patience is the cumulative distribution function,say F , of the time beyond which a customer would not be willing to wait. An equivalent descriptionis its corresponding hazard rate function. Assuming that F has a density f  F , its hazard ratefunction is given by ht  ft1  F t, t  0. Intuitively, htdt is the probability that acustomer, who has already survived waiting for t units of time, will abandon within the next dtunits, namely during t, tdt. Thus, the hazard rate ht provides a natural dynamic depiction ofimpatience, as it evolves while waiting. We will refer to this as the impatience function, or simplyimpatience.Figure 20 plots two impatience functions. It has appeared in 36, 112, and it has severalnoteworthy features. First, note that the impatience of priority customers lies strictly below thatof regular customers, so that the high priority customers emerge as stochastically more patientless impatient than regular customers. This could be a reflection of a more urgent need, onthe part of priority customers, to speak with an agent or it could reflect their higher level oftrust that they will be served soon after arrival. Second, the impatience functions of both types59of customers are not monotone and have secondary peaks at about 60 seconds. The peak, asit happens, reflects an announcement to customers who have waited 60 seconds, informing themof their relative place in the telequeue but not on their anticipated waiting time. As can beseen, the information here encourages abandonment. This could be in contrast to its originalgoal, namely preventing abandonment by reducing the uncertainty about waiting times. For atheoretical exploration of the benefits of inducing abandonment, see Whitt 153.  0 100 200 300 4000.0010.0020.0030.0040.0050.006Regular CustomersPriority CustomersHazard Rate Empirical ImPatienceFigure 20 Impatience Functions of Regular and Priority Customers follows 36, 112Models of Impatience The first model of impatience was developed by Palm 123 in the 1940s,who estimates the inconvenience of waiting. To this end, he introduces an inconvenience functionof time It, t  0, the derivative of which he calls irritation. As a plausible form for irritation,Palm proposesdIt  c  tdt, t  0,as being proportional to the hazard rate of customer abandonment, our impatience function . Thisreasoning implies that the distribution of patience the time a customer is willing to wait for serviceis Weibull. The special case of exponentially distributed patience, as in Erlang A, corresponds to  0, which is irritation or impatience that is constant over time.In calibrating , Palm 123 considers three circumstances, two of which have close presentdayanalogues. Short delays, during which a subscriber waits to be connected to a circuit, are similarto todays callcenter telequeueing delays. From direct measurements of patience, Palm concludesthat, in this case,  is close to one, possibly slightly less. Medium delays, after which an operatorcalls back a subscriber with a requested connection, are similar to those generated by presentdaycall back systems 15, 16. These induce exponentially distributed impatience, with   0.Palms findings are remarkably consistent with those reported by Kort in the 1980s. Basedon abandonment behavior in laboratory testing in the U.S.A., Kort 98 proposes Weibull as the60distribution of patience while waiting for a dial tone and deduces   1.23. Kort also has twoadditional models of patience time to abandonment while dialing, described in terms of a shiftedexponential and time to abandonment prior to network response after dialing, where a mixtureof two lognormal distributions fits well.Roberts 131 presents descriptive models for redial and abandonment behavior, based on experimental observations in France. A parametric model for the data in Roberts 131 is derivedby Baccelli and Hebuterne 20, who find that an Erlang distribution with 3 phases provides areasonable fit.Analogous studies of abandonment behavior in call centers exist in three related papers. Thefirst two, by Mandelbaum, Sakov, and Zeltyn 112 and Brown et al. 36, develop descriptive modelsfor customer patience. The third, by Zohar et al. 164, considers the following linear relationshipbetween the abandonment fraction and expected delay it holds for patience that is exponentiallydistributed, say with parameter PAbandon    EWait. 25To verify the relationship, start with the flow conservation equation,   PAbandon   EQueueLength, in which both sides represent the effective abandonment rate. Then substitute Littles Law, EQueueLength   EWait, and cancel out the . Empirical support for thisrelationship is given in Figure 21, which is based on the same data set as Figure 20.00.10.20.30.40.50.60 50 100 150 200 250average waiting time secondsfraction abandoningFigure 21 Empirical Relationship Between Abandonment and Delay from 36The focus of Zohar et al. 164 is the effect of customer learning on the above relationship. Inparticular, customers may learn through experience to adjust their expectations concerning delay,thus becoming relatively more patient at typically highly congested times of day. This effect tendsto flatten the observed slope of plots such as Figure 21.More fundamentally, though, the impatience in Figure 20 is hardly exponentially distributed,a prerequisite for 25 to hold in the first place. This fact suggests that the linear relationship inFigure 21 is to be expected under broader circumstances. And indeed, suppose that the distributionof patience has a density function whose value at the origin, say r0, is positive. Mandelbaum andZeltyn 117 show that, in the qualitydriven and QED regimes,PAbandon  r0  EWait, 2661which is an asymptotic generalization of 25. In fact, the distribution of patience becomes criticalonly at its origin because, in the qualitydriven and QED regimes, customers wait little, if at all.In the efficiencydriven regime, however, the asymptotic behavior differs.A comparison of the recent 36, 112, 164 with the older 98, 124, 131 is not straightforward forseveral reasons. While all address impatience, they do so in different circumstances. For example,the natural time unit for 98, 124, 131 is seconds, while patience in a call center is typicallymeasured in minutes, an average of about 10 minutes in 36, 112, 164. Furthermore, the customersin 36, 112, 164 hear a 60second announcement that reflects their status in queue, informationwhich was not available to the participants in 98, 124, 131.Censored Sampling Data associated with patience and abandonment are typically censored, sincethe patience of those who get served before they abandon is not fully observed. Consequently, theneed to account for censoring is an important topic in much of the work cited above. Both Palm 124and Kort 98 avoid the problem by sampling from unfortunate subjects who called a nonworkingservice and waited until they were exhausted. Mandelbaum, Sakov, and Zeltyn 112 accountfor censoring by using standard tools from the statistical theory of survival analysis, especiallythe KaplanMeier estimator of a distribution function. See the Appendix in 164 for details.Roberts 131 handles censoring in a selfdeveloped method, which is essentially equivalent to theKaplanMeier approach.Redials and Revisits Recalling Figure 4, there are three modes of return to a call center redials afterencountering a busy signal, redials after abandoning and revisits after service. The well developedtheory of retrial queues is mostly devoted to the first. For example, see Falin and Templeton 53.This is the least relevant to the practice of call centers, however. Indeed, managers have typicallyresolved the tradeoff between busy signals and abandonment in favor of the latter, by operatingwith an ample number of trunk lines. As a result, immediate returns are mostly redials afterabandonment, and delayed returns are revisits after service.In most work, redials are quantified in terms of some perseverance function that gives theprobability of an nth attempt, given a survival beyond the n  1th attempt. Andrews andParsons 9 report but do not actually show that redials to an L.L. Bean call center are infrequentenough and spread out enough over time that they do not alter the Poisson nature of arrivals. Seethe discussion at the end of 6.3.1. Hoffman and Harris 81 develop a method of jointly estimatingarrival rates before retrials and redial rates from ACD data.There is no work on revisits after service, to the best of our knowledge. This does not diminishfrom their prime importance, however. For example, revisits to a retail call center for subsequentpurchases may indicate satisfactory service, which is the opposite for revisits to technical support and both constitute central performance measures of their operation.6.3.4 System PerformanceGiven assumptions on primitives  arrivals, service times, abandonment, retrials  and the relationships among them, queueing models derive measures of system performance such as the distributionof the number of calls in queue, the distribution of delay in queue faced by a typical arriving customer and the overall abandonment rate.Roberts 131 estimates the virtual wait, the distribution of the time that a customer would haveto wait for service, given infinite patience. These plots are consistent with Kingmans exponential62law of congestion 11. If one assumes that customers are familiar with the system, based on priorservice experience, the actual delay would also coincide with the distribution of the time that acustomer expects to wait, as explained in 114, 138, 164.Indeed, one may think of two dimensions of customer patience the first is the time that acustomer is willing to wait, and the second, the time the customer expects to wait. Mandelbaum etal. 112 divide the expectation of the former by the latter to develop a patience index. They find,for example, that customers with internet questions are willing to wait 528 seconds, on average,but their expected virtual wait is roughly half that, and their patience index is 1.98. In contrast,customers calling to make stock trades are willing to wait even longer 678 seconds, but they areserved much more quickly, and their patience index is much higher 4.74. Thus, the index revealsthat stocktrading customers are relatively more patient, while customers with internet questionsare relatively less. Furthermore, this view of relative patience would not be captured by eitherexpected wait or willingness to wait, alone.Brown et al. 36 demonstrate that, given exponentially distributed times to abandonment andvirtual waits, the patience index for a set of customers should equal the empiricallyobserved ratio customers served customers abandoned. 27They then analyze the data from 112 comparing a patience index to the ratio above. To avoidproblems of censoring, the patience index is calculated using first quartiles, rather than means.Nevertheless, the two measures of patience  theoretical patience index and empirical abandonmentratio  are shown to have a strong linear relationship. This, despite the fact that, for these data,patience is not exponentially distributed. Thus, the results suggest that simple counts of servicesand abandonments can be used to estimate customer patience.The call center analyzed in 36, 112 has 1520 abandonment rates. Brown et al. 36 also usethese data to demonstrate that measures of system performance predicted by the Erlang A modelfit the centers actual performance well. Again a good fit emerges, despite the fact that neitherservice times nor patience are exponentially distributed, as assumed in the Erlang A model. Ourexperience suggests that such robustness, perhaps surprisingly, is not uncommon. This is clearly aphenomenon worthy of further research.Performance measures are, of course, correlated. An example is the remarkably linear relationship between the fraction of abandoning customers and average waiting time, theoretically justifiedin 25 and displayed in Figure 21 117. This implies that one need measure only one of the twostatistics the other can be arrived at through inference. More subtle is the fact that, in thesedata, arrival rates, service times, and delay in queue all tend to peak at the same times of day36. This correlation could be the result to any of several phenomena that peak hours are themost convenient hours for customers with longer service times to call that CSRs pace themselvesduring busy periods by slowing down that during periods with longer delays, customers with themore pressing problems  hence longer service duration  are more likely to not abandon. Analysisin 36 suggests that the first hypothesis is the one most likely to be true.6.4 Future Work in Data Analysis and ForecastingThere has been recent progress in the analysis of callcenter data. Callbycall data from a smallnumber of sites have been obtained and analyzed, and these limited results have proven to be63fascinating. In some cases, such as the characterization of the arrival process and of the delayof arriving calls to the system, conventional assumptions and models of system performance havebeen upheld. In others, such as the characterization of the servicetime distribution and of customerpatience, the data have revealed fundamental, new views of the nature of the service process. Ofcourse, these limited studies are only the beginning, and the effort to collect and analyze callcenterdata can and should be expanded in every dimension.Perhaps the most pressing practical need is for improvements in the forecasting of arrival rates.For highly utilized call centers, more accurate, distributional forecasts are essential. While thereexists some research that develops methods for estimating and predicting arrival rates 7, 36, 90,119, there is surely room for additional improvement to be made. However, further developmentof models for estimation and prediction will depend, in part, on access to richer data sets. Webelieve that much of the randomness of Poisson arrival rates may be explained by covariates thatare not captured in currently available data.Procedures for predicting waitingtimes are also worth pursuing. Hopp and Sturgis 83 analytically demonstrate how the form of the servicelevel constraint  such as the probability of meetinga quoted delay or the expected tardiness beyond a quoted delay  affects the point forecast of delaythat should be quoted in a singleserver system. The paper also uses simulation to test the robustness of these singleserver results in the context of multipleserver systems. Whitt 154 developsmethods for predicting delays in a variety of FCFS, multipleserver systems. The extension ofthese types of methods to more complex, priority and networked systems requires additional work,however. For example, see Armony and Maglaras 16. Fieldbased studies that characterize theperformance of different methods would also be of value.More broadly, there is need for the development of a wider range of descriptive models. Whilea characterization of arrival rates, abandonment from queue, and service times are essential forthe management of call centers, they constitute only a part of the complete picture of what goeson. For example, there exist self service times and abandonment commonly called optoutbehavior that arise from customer use of IVRs. Neither of these phenomena is likely to be the sameas its CSR analogue. Similarly, sojourn times and abandonment from webbased services have notbeen examined in multimedia centers.Parallel, descriptive studies are also needed to validate or refute the robustness of initial findings.For example, lognormal service times have been reported in two call centers, both of which are partof retail financial services companies. Perhaps the servicetime distribution of catalogue retailersor helpdesk operations have different characteristics. Similarly, one would like to test Figure 20sfinding that the waitingtime messages customers hear while telequeueing promote, rather thandiscourage, abandonment.It would also be interesting to put Palm 123, Roberts 131, Kort 98 and Mandelbaum etal. 112 in perspective. These studies provide empirical and exploratory models for impatienceon the phone in Sweden in the 40s, France in the late 70s, the U.S. in the early 80s, and Israelin the late 90s. A systematic comparison of patience across countries, for current phone services,should be a worthy, interesting undertaking.There is the opportunity to further develop and extend the scope of explanatory models. Indeed,given the high levels of system utilization in the QED regime, a small percentage error in theforecast of the offered load can lead to significant, unanticipated changes in system performance.In particular, the state of the art in forecasting call volumes is still rudimentary. Similarly, the fact64that service times are lognormally distributed enables the use of standard parametric techniques tounderstand the effect of covariates on the normally distributed natural log of service times 36.In wellrun QED call centers, only a small fraction of the customers abandon around 13,hence about 97 of the millions of observations are censored. Based on such figures, one canhardly expect any reasonable estimate of the whole patience distribution, nonparametrically atleast. Fortunately, however, the analysis of 117, as represented in 26, suggests that only thebehavior of impatience near the origin is of relevance, and this is observable and analyzable.Indeed, callcenter data are challenging the stateoftheart of statistics, and new statisticaltechniques seem to be needed to support their analysis. Two examples are the accurate nonparametric estimation of hazard rates, with corresponding confidence intervals, and the survivalanalysis of tens of thousands, or even millions, of observations, possibly correlated and highlycensored.Finally, in the following section we will also argue that a broader goal should be, in fact, theanalysis of integrated operational, marketing, human resources, and psychological data. That is,the analysis of these integrated data is essential if one is to understand and quantify the role ofoperational service quality as a driver for business success.7 Future Directions in CallCenter ResearchThe work described above constitutes only a beginning. Below, we describe what we believe to besome natural next steps in the evolution of call center research. In all cases, both empirical andtheoretical work are needed to develop the depth of understanding required.7.1 A Broader View of the Service ProcessThe service process at most call centers takes place over multiple stages. Aside from a few exceptions, however, the work we have described thus far has been geared to a simple, single stage ofservice there currently exists little analysis directed at the broader service process.For example, many large call centers use IVRs, but an understanding of how they functionis far from complete. There exist some theoretical papers that explicitly or implicitly model theuse of IVRs in certain circumstances. Srinivasan and Talim 141 analyze a twostation networkmodel of an IVR, possibly followed by CSR service. They show that industry practice  whichfirst uses an Erlang B model to fix the number of trunk lines, then an Erlang C model to set thenumber of CSRs  can lead to problematic recommendations, such as having more agents thantrunks. Cleveland and Mayben 46 describe this industry practice. Other examples of modelsthat explicitly include the use of IVRs include Brandt, Brandt, Spahl, and Weber 33, Brandt andBrandt 31, and Armony and Maglaras 15, 16. The only empirical treatment of IVR servicetimedistributions of which we are aware, however, is the brief description provided in Mandelbaum etal. 112.Furthermore, IVR technology is rapidly evolving. The current generation of speech recognitionand artificial intelligence AI technologies have increased the range, as well as the speed, of IVRsupported selfservice. These advances are likely to make IVRbased service increasingly important,and study is required to understand how the technologies can best improve the service process.65The service that CSRs provide to customers may also be thought of as occurring over multiplestages. Calls may be escalated from a frontline CSR to a supervisor or problem specialist. Insome operations, such as insurance claims, service requests commonly require several phone callsto be resolved. It is also often the case that, having satisfied the customers service request, a CSRhas the opportunity to crosssell another product or service.Furthermore, customer transitions among IVR, CSR, and other nodes of a callcenters internal network can exhibit strong interdependencies. For example the time customers spend interactingwith an IVR is fundamentally related to the time required for agents to serve them. Indeed, manybusinesses encourage customers to use IVRs as a means of self service, with the specific hope ofreducing the time spent with a CSR.Other technologies can also affect the nature of service durations in a systematic fashion. Asnoted before, the screen pops enabled by CTI can reduce and standardize service times. Similarly,the automatic greetings and farewells used by telephone operators reduce both the service durationand its stochastic variability.Because of the shared nature of many callcenter resources, customers affect each others service times. For example, Aksin and Harker 4 develop a theoretical model in which the corporateinformation system is a bottleneck. Customers service durations with agents are driven by agentqueries to the shared system, and as congestion increases, service durations increase as well. Numerical examples in the paper demonstrate how this can lead to counterintuitive phenomena forexample, performance levels may decrease as the number of agents increase. As far as we know,there exists no empirical work that systematically investigates the claim.7.2 An Exploration of Intertemporal EffectsJust as the process by which a given call is served may be complex, there also exist interdependenciesthat exist over time. We believe that a fuller description and modelling of these interdependenciesare essential for a complete understanding of callcenter behavior as well as of servicedeliverysystems more generally.At the most basic level, primitives used in queueing models systematically vary over time. Forarrival rates, which exhibit regular, seasonal patterns, this fact is well accepted. It also appearsto be true for service rates though, in this case, the documentation is far less complete and thereasons far less clear.There are many sources of systematic variation in service times that should be better describedand analyzed. For example, Gustafson 73 documents learningcurve effects as they gain experience, CSRs become systematically faster on the job. Similarly, Sze 145 describes a phenomenonsometimes called shift fatigue in which operators may initially work faster during periods ofoverload to work off the customer queue, but may tire and work slower than usual if the heavy loadis sustained and if no relief is provided.Again, there exists limited work that addresses some of these effects. The data analysis ofBrown et al. 36 described in 6.3.4 shows that service times at one call center are longer duringperiods with higher arrival rates. The hiring model in Gans and Zhou 60 accommodates learningcurve effects, should they exist. In both cases, however, our understanding of what drives theduration of service times and how these effects should be modelled is only rudimentary.66Similarly, over the course of the day or week, customer patience may vary because customershave learned to expect more or less congestion during certain intervals. Again, Zohar et al. 164describe and model this type of behavior, but work must be done to understand this effect at amore fundamental level.7.3 A Better Understanding of Customer and CSR BehaviorMost of the operational primitives of callcenter queueing models  arrivals, services, abandonment,retrials  are functions of human behavior. For example, the need to view intertemporal changesin these primitives is intimately related to the fact that peoples behavior changes according tocircumstances and over time.Indeed, one of the most challenging aspects in developing queueing models for call centers isthe incorporation of human factors, for both customers and agents, in a practical manner. Thisopens up a vast agenda for multidisciplinary research.We note that there exists a substantial body of research, which originates in psychology andmarketing, that studies peoples behavior while waiting in queues. The articles in Section III ofMandelbaum 103, entitled Consumer Psychology, have ample leads. Most of this work concernsphysical queues, such as those found in a bank or a clinic. As we noted in Section 2.4, however,telequeues are phantom, hence the experience of waiting in them is likely to differ significantlyfrom that in physical queues.The subtlety of human factors can make their effect on telequeues difficult to properly quantify,measure and model. Consider, for example, human impatience while waiting for a teleservice. Itsurely depends on the communication channel  telephone, internet, IVR  and on the type ofcustomer. But who is more patient, a regular customer or a VIP VIP customers may becomeimpatient and abandon the telequeue more quickly Figure 20. At the same time, the actualwaiting time performance may be better, and hence their relative patience greater Section 6.3.4.Furthermore, CSRs and customers experiences are linked. For example, Schneider et al. 135show that the employees perceptions of working conditions and customers perceptions of service quality affect each other over time. For more on this interaction, see also the referenceswithin 135.Customer and CSR Behavior as Equilibrium Phenomena Both customers and employees havethe ability to adjust their expectations, based on experience, and to adjust behavior, based onexpectations. In call centers, this adjustment can also be seen in response to management practice,which sometimes dramatically affects behavior. For example, an incentive scheme that rewardsagents for maintaining a low AHT can lead CSRs to hang up on customers. The empirical distribution displayed on the left side of Figure 19 reflects a similar pattern, though in this case agentswere taking small rest breaks by hanging up on customers. Similarly, announcements made tocustomers waiting on hold can lead them to abandon the telequeue, as noted in 6.3.3.The CSR and customer phenomena described above suggest that an appropriate framework forincluding human behavior is that of a gametheoretic or economic equilibrium, arrived at throughlearning and selfoptimization. This is the perspective of a number of recent papers. Shumsky andPinker 140 consider settings in which frontline CSRs act as gatekeepers who may attempt tosolve customers problems or send them onto a specialist, and they use principalagent models toanalyze the impact of incentive compensation schemes.67Mandelbaum and Shimkin 114 develop a theoretical equilibriumanalysis of rational customerswho compare their expected remaining waiting time with a subjective value they ascribe to service.This is equivalent to assuming a linear cost structure, and it implies that additional factors, such asthe likelihood of never being served, are required to motivate a waiting customer to abandon thequeue. Such a motivation is not needed in Shimkin and Mandelbaum 138, who show that whenwaiting costs are nonlinear, an analogous equilibrium can be achieved. Zohar et al. 164 provideempirical evidence for the thesis of rational, adaptive customers, and they present a simpler andmore analytically tractable form of the original, linear model. Armony and Maglaras 15, 16 andWhitt 155 both develop similar notions of abandonment and congestion as equilibrium phenomena.Multiple Levels of Equilibria Furthermore, the notion of an equilibrium exists simultaneously ata number of levels. In real time, system congestion interacts with customers patience to engenderbalking and abandonment behavior, and these behaviors help to stabilize the system. Over longerperiods, balking and abandonment behavior during one interval can be seen to lead to retrialsduring another. Thus, one might think of arrival rates, service times, patience, and the propensityto redial at any point in time as being jointly dependent on queueing system performance over thecourse of the week.That is, system performance may more properly be modelled as depending on arrivalrate,servicetime, patience, and retrial functions that vary systematically over the week see Mandelbaum et al. 109. The form of the functions represents a fixed point, arrived at through customerand CSR experience and adjustment over many weeks.The work cited above represents a promising start. Still, little is known about the processesthat underly waiting and service behaviors. Just as the analysis of abandonment data have guidedZohar, Mandelbaum and Shimkin 164 to simplify the theoretical model developed in 114, adeeper economic and psychological understanding of abandonment and service behaviors will enablecontinuing improvements in their theoretical characterization.Finally, the hierarchy of equilibria described above may be extended one level further. Justas customers expectations concerning queueing delays may be learned through experience, theirrepeated contacts with a company  through its call centers and through other communicationschannels  may lead them to form broader expectations concerning the value the company provides.These expectations would then lead customers to alter their buying patterns, for example, for betteror worse.The Impact of Other Social and Economic Phenomena A wide variety of social and economicphenomena have profound effects on customer and CSR behavior, and a detailed understandingof how they function remains to be developed. For example, external labor markets and internalsocial networks affect CSR onthejob learning and turnover rates. See Castilla 41 and thereferences therein. Even broader factors, such as growth of international callcenter operations,can affect how incoming customers are routed, as well as the types of skills CSRs at various sitesshould have. Thus, a full understanding of what drives customer and CSR behavior requires workacross a broad set of disciplines in the social sciences.7.4 CRM Customer RelationshipRevenue ManagementThe notion that service quality affects customer buying behavior  and, more broadly, his or hervalue to the organization  requires one to consider elements of quality beyond the operational68measures on which we have concentrated thus far. For example, as outlined in 2.5, an adequatetreatment of service quality is likely to include notions of the effectiveness of service encounters, aswell as judgments concerning the content of CSRs interactions with customers. It is also likely toinclude financial, as well as operational, measures of success.For instance, it may be that calls which reduce future rework or improve the likelihood offuture purchases are judged more effective, and effective calls require longer service durations.Conversely, customer abandonment that results from system congestion can reduce the likelihoodof future purchases, and given a fixed set of servers shorter service times reduce abandonment.Then, given the current state of the system  the overall level of congestion, which specific customersare waiting in queue, and which are being served by what specific CSRs  one would like to knowwhether it is best to have more effective longer or quicker calls.Thus, a broader view of service quality may affect managers and academics notions of whatgets optimized during the service process. Research that supports this view is just emerging,however. For example, Pinker and Shumsky 127 posit that learning curve behavior drives thequality of service offered by CSRs, and they consider how learning and quality are affected byCSR specialization. Gans 58 and Hall and Porteus 75 offer models of service quality affectingcustomer churn. These models attempt to connect operational, human resources, and marketingdecisions, but they are highly stylized. To become practical, the analysis must capture more detailof the service process.In fact, Customer Relationship Management CRM systems promise to enable companies tobetter track and understand how each service experience affects a customers longterm buying behavior. Skillsbased routing systems provide a natural complement, in that they allow a company toexercise much finer control over who serves that customer, as well as how and when. These systemsonly provide the necessary infrastructure, however. Research is required to understand exactly howcustomers respond to service and, in turn, exactly how their service should be controlled.Using CRM systems to learn about the revenue impact of operating decisions goes far beyondcurrent practice, however. To date, these systems have typically been used to recall individualcustomers preferences and to identifying crossselling opportunities. Substantial investments indata analysis and statistical learning tools are required in order to transform CRM systems intocustomer revenue management systems. A first step in this direction is taken in Ariely et al. 12,which in the context of internet services trades off shortterm benefits of cross selling with longerterm learning costs. For more on the tradeoffs to be made when crossselling, see Aksin andHarker 3.This application CRM technology would also constitute a contribution to the theory and practiceof revenue management. First, the approach would use sophisticated data mining tools to betterassess the opportunity cost of denying or degrading a customers service. Furthermore, thecomplementary analysis of operating controls is naturally pursued as an infinitehorizon problem,in contrast to the finitehorizon framework of traditional revenue management formulations. For asimple example, see Savin et al. 134.7.5 A Call for MultiDisciplinary ResearchThe research required to support this scheme falls across several disciplines. In broad terms,expertise in marketing, data mining, and statistics are required to segregate customers into classes69and to develop those classes cost or index functions, as in the Gc rule of 22. Knowledge ofhuman resources is required to design agent skillsets, as well as to develop effective hiring andtraining plans. Operationsbased research is needed to understand how best to route customersand their work to CSRs. Information systems expertise is required to ensure that the underlyingCRM and routing systems are capable of performing the required functions.Furthermore, because customers, CSRs and systems jointly interact, much of the required research is inherently multidisciplinary. We highlight a few of the many elements of callcenter designand management that would benefit from such an approach In skillsbased routing, operational decisions determine the duration of time that calls wait onhold, as well as the nature of the CSR who serves the call. These, in turn, affect the callersexperience, hence short and longterm behavior. Thus, a solution to the problem requires anintegrated view of both operational and marketing issues. Skillsbased routing decisions also affect customer abandonment from queue, and impatienceis, fundamentally, a psychological process. Similarly, the customers perception of servicedepends on his or her interaction with a CSR. Thus, operating policies should also be informedby a proper understanding of the psychology of individuals and of social interactions. The numbers of different CSRs, as well as the types of skill sets that they have, affecthow the weekly scheduling and realtime routing problems can be solved. Thus, these HRproblems of organizational design and management are linked to marketing outcomes throughoperational, callrouting controls. They also have an operational element, themselves. Incentive schemes complement skill sets and jobladders in the design of CSRs work. Toolsfrom microeconomics, such as principalagent models, can provide insight into possible orlikely outcomes of proposed system designs. Advances in automation technologies, such as speech recognition and AI, affect the design ofIVRs, webbased interaction, and callscripting  as well as how they are integrated. Thesechanges will have a direct effect on the time required to complete tasks. More subtly, andas importantly, they will also affect system performance through their impact on customersatisfaction and behavior. The design of information flows also affects both CSR and customer behavior and, in turn,system performance. A simple example for CSRs is the use of flashing panels to providerealtime feedback on the length of the queue. An analogous example for customers is thecommunication of information concerning expected delay in queue. The need for statistical tools arises everywhere in the analysis of call center operations.Examples include the forecasting of arrival rates and service times the characterization ofthe hazardrate of abandonment impatience function and the validation or refutation ofqueueingtheoretic performance models. Data mining and statistical analysis will also be essential in developing the link betweenoperating decisions and their marketing consequences. For example, they should be used todetermine which customers have high potential value and should receive better service.708 ConclusionTelephone call centers are an economically important new form of operation. They employ a growingfraction of the work force and mediate a significant volume of trade in developed economies.While tools from operations management and operations research have proved to be essentialfor their management, a number of problems related to call centers most basic operational characteristics have yet to be thoroughly tackled. In particular, the forecasting of arrival rates, thecharacterization of customer and agent behavior, and the analysis of the timevarying nature ofthese systems need to be more fully developed, and they represent challenges for academics andmanagers alike.Furthermore, a number of new opportunities also exist for extending call center capabilities.Skillsbased routing, networking, and speechrecognition are examples of promising technologiesfor which an understanding is just beginning to be developed. A broad range of multidisciplinarywork is needed to help them fully realize their potential.We believe that this research is exciting because it will also have impact beyond call centersthemselves. Indeed, the service sector represents 70 or more of most developed economies, andthis fraction continues to grow. In many parts of the sector, operational, marketing and humanresource issues are also tightly intertwined. Thus, the research frameworks and insights that arederived from multidisciplinary callcenter research are certain to apply more broadly.A Glossary of CallCenter AcronymsAcronym Description DefinitionACD automatic call distributor p. 6ANI automatic number identification p. 5ASA average speed of answer p. 8CRM customer relationship management p. 7CSR customer service representative p. 5CTI computertelephony integration p. 7DNIS dialed number identification service p. 5IVR interactive voice response unit also called VRU p. 5PABX private automatic branch exchange also called PBX p. 5PBX private automatic branch exchange also called PABX p. 5PSTN public switched telephone network p. 5TSF telephone service factor also called the service level p. 9VRU interactive voice response unit also called IVR p. 5WFM workforce management p. 13References1 ATT.
