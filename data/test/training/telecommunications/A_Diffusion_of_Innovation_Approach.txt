Abstract
This paper focuses on the theory of adoption of cellular phone as an
innovation and its diffusion and penetration in the Pakistani society
and to confirm Roger’s theory of diffusion of innovation. More
specifically, the study aims to test if five categories of adopters and five
stages of adoption [as suggested by Roger (1976)] adequately explain
the behavior of cellular phone users in Pakistan. The study also aims to
evaluate the role played by advertising in the process of diffusion of
innovation. An attempt is also made to study relationships among other
variables of interest. To achieve its objectives, this study formulates the
diffusion of innovation theory using survey research method from
population of Pakistan(a sample of200 respondents are approached)
and various statistical techniques are applied on the information
gathered before drawing any conclusions. Our results support the
theory of diffusion of innovation. We do not find an evidence to believe
that advertising plays a statistically significant direct role in the
process of diffusion of innovation, although we have not explored the
extent of its indirect contribution in the process.

Keywords:   Adoption; diffusion of innovation; cellular phone; Pakistan

I. Introduction
Today’s markets have become global. Different requirements of various customer
segments at one time are the direct result of this globalization, which arise from different
political, social, cultural, and technical perspectives. Industrial revolutions and eras of
creative destruction result from major discontinuous technological changes. A new
industrial revolution is about to begin. Due to the breakthrough of mobile communication
innovations together with development in other communication technologies, mobile
technology diffusion is starting to replace existing industrial processes with more
efficient ones.

Rogers (1976) says that an innovation is an idea, practice, or object that is
perceived as new. Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated
through certain channels, over time among the members of a social system. He has
378      Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences Vol. 29, No. 2
identified five sequential stages awareness interests, evolution, trial and adoption. And
the process of adopting an innovation follows five groups of people innovators, early
adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. This study attempts to testify the
Roger’s theory of diffusion of innovation in Pakistani society with reference to cellular
phone, and about the role played by advertisement in this respect.

II. Literature Review
Shahid (1994) writes that as consumers of mass communication, we are constantly
exposed to material that both informs and persuades information about new discoveries in
technology, products designed to make our life easier, inventions and other innovative
procedures. The process of diffusion is defined as the  acceptance, over time, of some
specific item-an idea or practice, by individuals, groups or other adopting units, linked to,
specific channels of communication, to a social structure, and, to a given system of
values, or culture (Katz et.al. 1963).

Robertson (1967) describes in his article, “the process of innovation and the
diffusion of innovation”, that there are different questions related to innovation and its
diffusion process, depending on the strategy. Different type of people adopt new ideas at
different times (Rodman 2006; Wildemuth 1992) . The process of innovation decision
has five stages, knowledge, attitude, adoption, implementation, confirmation. He further
adds that there are five different adopters of diffusion process e.g. innovators, early
adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards (Rogers 1976).

Rogers (2001) says that the adoption process is the mental process though which
an individual passes from First hearing about an innovation to final adoption. At
knowledge stage the individual is exposed to the innovation but lacks complete
information about it. He then becomes interested in the innovation and seeks information
about it at the attitude stage.  At the adoption stage, the individual mentally applies the
innovation to his present and anticipated future situation, and then decides whether or not
try it. The individual uses the innovation on a small scale in order to determine its utility
in his own situation at the implementation stage. At the confirmation stage the individual
decides to continue the full use of innovation. Evidence from research studies indicates
the conception of confirmation stage is probably valid.

Markus (1987) studies in his article that companies consider technology factors
important in deciding to adopt and deploy wireless devices designed for mobile telephony
and information services. Advertising is a vital tool as well as powerful communication
force to sell goods, services, images and ideas (Chandra 2004).

Wang and Kettinger (1995) suggest that the tremendous success of success of
cellular technology has fundamentally changed the way people communicate and
promoted the evolution of a new multi billion dollar wireless communication industry.
Advertising effected the sale growth of new, infrequently purchased products (Horsky
and Simon 1983) and it attained its maximum effect after several months (Simon and
Sebastian 1987).

Shimp (2000) examines a stream of new products is absolutely essential for most
company’s success and long-term growth. Despite the huge investments and concerted
efforts to introduce new products or services, may are never successful. In the process of
Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Aqsa Iram Shahzadi Khan      379
diffusion of innovation innovators are 2.5%, early adopters are 13.5%, early majority is
34%, late majority is 34% and laggards are 16% (Bryant and Thompson 2002).

Pedersen and Ling (2002) Valente and Davis (1999) analyze what are the
requirements of users to adopt mobile phone? These requirements are technological,
business strategic and behavioral.

III. Statement of the Problem
Primary objectives of this study are to answer the following two questions: How
has the innovative cellular phone technology diffused in Pakistan? How significant has
been the role of advertisement in this diffusion process?

Hypothesis:
To answer above questions, we construct the following hypotheses based on what
has been observed from the literature reviewed on diffusion of innovation theory:

H1: Process of adopting an innovation (like cellular phone), in case of Pakistan follows
5 groups of people to include innovators, early adopters, early majority, late
majority and laggards.

H2: Diffusion of information (like cellular phone technology) completes in 5 stages to
include awareness, interest, evolution, trial and adoption.

H3: The most common reason to adopt the innovation (cellular mobile technology in
the case) is media campaign.

Statistical Hypothesis
To judge the study statistically, following hypotheses are also advanced:

H4: Gender and type of mobile phone connection (Prepaid/Postpaid) are statistically
related with each other

H5: Type of mobile phone connection (Prepaid/Postpaid) is statistically related to
education.

H6: Age has a statistically significant impact on the type of mobile phone connection
(Prepaid/Postpaid) adoption.

H7: Occupation of individual has a statistically significant bearing on the selection of
type of mobile phone connection (Prepaid/Postpaid).

H8: Prepaid connection is the first choice of adopters.

H9: Male prefers to own prepaid connection of mobile phone.

H10: Female prefers to own prepaid connection.

H11: Gender has a statistically significant effect on the length of time mobile is held.
380      Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences Vol. 29, No. 2

H12: Education has a statistically significant affect on length of time mobile is held.

H13: Gender does not provide statistically significant explanation if the mobile
ownership depends on it

H14: Age of individual has a statistically significant affect on the trend of mobile
ownership.

H15: Education has a statistically significant affect on mobile ownership.

H16: Occupation has a statistically significant impact on mobile ownership.

IV. Research Methods
By considering the need, nature and objectives of this research study, different
research methods and techniques have been used. To obtain basic data for hypothesis
testing, survey questionnaire method has been used. The structured questionnaire
comprises of mostly closed ended questions with a few questions having an option of
“other”. The survey uses both descriptive and analytical method to address the stated
research aims.

Population
The random sample consists of 200 respondents, which is a statistically
appropriate sample size. The sample is characterized with a number of features which are
a very close representation of the actual population. Davies and Mosdell (2006) write that
sampling is mainly used in large scale quantitative surveys where having a representative
sample is essential to provide results which can be generalized to a population at large.
Sample is selected from five major cities of Pakistan including Multan, Lahore,
Islamabad, Peshawar and Karachi. Every city gets 20% representation in the sample of
200.

Description of Data Set
Random sample tracks true population very closely. Just over 60% of sample
constitutes an age group of people between 10 and 29. This age group represents about
60% of Pakistan’s total population as well, hence random sample tallies the actual
population very closely.

V. Findings
Primary objectives of the survey have been to answer the following two questions:
‘How has the innovative cellular phone technology diffused in Pakistan?’ and ‘how
significant has been the role of advertisement in this diffusion process?’

Of the surveyed sample, 92% of the respondents were using mobile phones. The
fact that the sample had a bias towards urban population, vast majority of the sample was
expected to be using this technology anyway. Due to budgetary reason it was not possible
to access rural areas.

Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Aqsa Iram Shahzadi Khan      381
Figures indicate that those who have held this technology primarily had it during
the last three years (30%). In total, about 60% of the respondents have had mobile phones
for last 5 years. This finding is quite in line with the figures released by Pakistan
Telecommunication Authority PTA (2008) according to which in 2002 total number of
mobile phone users were only 1.7 million. This number has tremendously increased in
the last five years to about 77 million by the end of 2007 (almost half of Pakistan’s
population is now using mobile cellular technology). It is assumed that in the next few
years, this number is expected to increase further although with a relatively slow growth
rate as saturation has already started to feature in the country now.

Findings of Figure 1 also lead us to accept the null hypothesis 1 (H1). . Hence, as
suggested by Roger (1976), the diffusion of innovation takes place in five stages. We
note that innovators were only 3% of the surveyed population. These were followed by
19% early adopters, 29% early majority, 30% late majority and 10% laggards. The
statement made by H1 seems to have a statistically significant value to assume that
process of adopting an innovation like cellular phone follows 5 groups of people
innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards in case of Pakistani
society (Figure 1)

H2 states that diffusion of information (like in case of cellular phone technology)
shall complete in 5 stages: awareness, interest, evolution, trial and adoption. Results have
led us to accept H2 as well. It was found that at awareness stage individual is exposed to
the innovation but lacks complete information about it. As confirmed by results that more
then 70% respondents have a memory of reading/watching/ hearing the media
advertisement campaigns. Individual then becomes interested or shows attitude to the
innovation and seeks information about it as 80% respondents remember the
advertisement and they access media to get information. At the evolution stage the
individual mentally applies the innovation to his present and anticipated future situation
and then decides whether or not is trying it. As calculations explore that 95% respondents
have evaluate the application of mobile phone into their life. The individual, then, uses
the innovation on a small scale in order to determine its utility in his own situation at the
trail implement stage. As only 3% respondents adopt this innovation as a trial. At the
adoption stage the individual decides to continue the full use of innovation. According to
382      Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences Vol. 29, No. 2
facts 93% respondents adopt/confirm the innovation. (Figure1)

Hypothesis H3 predicts that the most common reason to adopt the innovation
(cellular mobile technology in the case) will be the media campaign. Figures revealed
that the most common reason (for 48% of the respondents) for accessing mobile
technology was a professional/business need. Hence, results indicate that H3 must be
rejected. Having said that, common sense dictates that in today’s age advertisement
campaigns certainly play a significant role in peoples’ behaviour. The professional /
business need must have had some benefit of the advertising done by cellular companies.
Unfortunately, however, our study does not explore this particular angle leaving it for
future research to quantify. (Figure 2)

H4 explores if gender and type of mobile phone connection (prepaid/postpaid)
were related to each other. However, p value suggests that H4 needs to be rejected as
there was no statistically significant evidence of their dependence on each other. Hence,
we can conclude that selection of type of mobile connection does not necessarily depends
on gender of the user. (Table 1)

H5 predicts that type of mobile phone connection (Prepaid/postpaid) is related to
education. No evidence exits to support H5 (P=0.457). Hence, we cannot say with
certainty if level of education of mobile user shall have an impact on the type of mobile
phone connection. (Table 1)

Hypothesis H6 predicts that age of the mobile user affects one’s decision on the
type of mobile phone connection (prepaid/postpaid) adoption. However, there is no such
statistical evidence to believe (P=0.230) that it really does happen. We rather reject H6
concluding that age does not have a bearing on such a decision making. (Table 1)

H7 predicts that occupation of individual affects the selection of type of mobile
phone connection (prepaid/postpaid). Chi-square analysis, however, suggests that
occupation of individual does not impact the decision of selection of type of mobile
phone (p=0.859), resulting into rejection of H7. (Table 1)

H8 predicts that prepaid connection is the first choice of adopters. Test and CI for
one proportion supports the hypothesis as majority of the persons preferred prepaid
connection (P=0.000). (Table 2)

H9 predicts that male users prefer to own prepaid connection of mobile phone.
Test and CI for one proportion (P=0.000) supports the hypothesis that most of the
respondents who own prepaid connection happen to be male. (Table 2)

H10 predicts that female prefer to own prepaid connection. After the test and CI
for one proportion (P=0.000) this hypothesis is accepted as well. (Table 2)

Hypothesis H11 predicts that there is a relationship between gender and length of
time mobile held. This hypothesis is accepted it is a statistically significant finding
(P=0.039). (Table 1)

H12 predicts that length of mobile held is related to education. Chi-square
calculation indicates that there is no statistically significant reason to believe that it is true
(P=0.756). Hence, we reject null hypothesis of H12 against the alternative. (Table 1)

Hypothesis H13 predicts that gender does not determine the decision to own
mobile. Chi-square test results into us rejecting H13 (P=0.159) suggesting that gender
does drive the decision to own mobile. (Table 1)

Hypothesis H14 predicts that age of individual affects the mobile ownership. Chi
square rejects this hypothesis (P=0.041) suggesting that age does drive the decision to
own a mobile. (Table 1)
384      Pakistan Journal of Social Sciences Vol. 29, No. 2
H15 predicts that level of education impacts one’s decision to own mobile. This
hypothesis is rejected on the basis of Chi-square test (P=0.15) suggesting that education
does not necessarily decide if one would own a mobile or not. (Table 1)

Hypothesis H16 predicts that peoples’ occupation contributes in decision of
mobile ownership. Test and CI for one proportion (P=0.000) leads us to accept H16,
implying that occupation does count as a factor towards owning a mobile phone. This is
in line with our finding that majority of the users have mobile phones due to their
professional / business need. (Table 2)

VI. Discussion
In recent past, the over whelming growth in information and technology, has lead
the rapid pace of current advancements in all spheres of life. The trend is reflected in
from of many different innovative products and services, on which human race has
started to show an inevitable reliance over time. Computers, internet, email, variety of
transportation means and cellular phones all are amongst the examples of such
innovations.

Roger (1976, 2001) depicts that diffusion is the process by which an innovation is
communicated through certain channels, over time among the members of a social
system. The diffusion process remains a significant research interest in communication,
and diffusion theory remains a dominant theoretical paradigm for new media studies.

This has explored different aspects of usage of cellular phone. According to
Roger’s theory, diffusion of innovation is a complete process. It has five stages and there
Muhammad Ashraf Khan, Aqsa Iram Shahzadi Khan      385
are also five categories of adopters (Rogers 1976, 2001) and advertising campaigns play a
significant role in the process of diffusion of innovation.

All, but one, hypotheses were tested as positive suggesting that diffusion of
innovation follows five stages and steps as suggested by Rogers as innovators, early
adopter, early majority, late majority and laggards and five stages as awareness, interest,
evolution, train and adoption (Roger’s 1976, 2001). However, we could not find
sufficient statistical reason to conclude that advertising campaigns play a significant role
in diffusion of innovation. It was observed that peoples’ choice and adoption to the
innovation was driven by factors other than advertisement campaigns (particularly
professional / business needs). Having said that one may not be able to discount the
indirect role of advertising campaigns as no user would typically go after such an
innovation without some degree of exposure to such campaigns. While advertisement
campaigns of various cellular companies do not necessarily play a decisive role in case of
individuals accessing the technology, such campaigns indeed proved instrumental in
introducing the technology to masses and helping achieve the critical mass in due time.
Moreover, it is very much expected that these campaigns continue to remain an important
factor for businesses to decide in favor of accessing the technology.

Findings suggest that innovation of mobile cellular technology has followed the
diffusion of innovation process in accordance with the famous theory of Roger. All the
suggested stages of innovation diffusion have closely been observed in case of Pakistan,
whereby the critical mass has been observed to have reached in about 8 – 10 years time.

In terms of policy implications, researcher draws a number of conclusions from the
research findings. The fact that about half of Pakistan’s population has already accessed
this technology by now, it is very unlikely that this pace of technology access shall be
witnessed for long. Hence, the growth of adoption to the technology is expected to be
slower in the years to follow. This also means that the cellular companies are to face an
intense competition ahead if they are to remain successful in the business. More and more
competition in price plans, service quality and package offering shall become the key to
success for all. This will of course give rise to even greater market competition.

For government policy makers, it is important to ensure that as more and more
users of this technology are emerging over time, service providers’ capacity to serve
these customers satisfactorily remains intact. At times, such a demand trend by customers
motivates companies to extend their customer base beyond their limits and reach. This
obviously is not a healthy sign and kills the whole purpose of technological development.
