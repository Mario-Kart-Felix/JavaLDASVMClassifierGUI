We have been discussing and working on "convergence" in the wireless industry over the last 7 years. The introduction of smart phones accelerated the merging of voice and data communications to where we now begin to see the maturity of these efforts. The next great trend will be "integration", as wireless becomes an even more ubiquitous part of our lives. Many of the emerging technologies which we are promoting and incubating within the IEEE will rely on wireless communication; including the "Internet of Things" (IoT), eHealth, Wearable Devices, Smart Cities and many more. As we pursue our goal of "Advancing Technology for Humanity", we find we will be relying on a foundation that is grounded in wireless communications. It is my distinct pleasure to invite you to attend Wireless and Telecommunication Conference 2017 & Network (Wireless-2017). Wireless and Telecommunication Conference 2017 will be held during July 20-21, 2017 Munich, Germany, and aims to accelerate scientific discoveries and Wireless Communication Technology, with the theme“Connecting People to Connecting Global”. yours sincerely, Dr. Norman Shaw Director Product & Business Development IEEE Standards Association, USA   Sessions/Tracks Wireless & Telecommunication
