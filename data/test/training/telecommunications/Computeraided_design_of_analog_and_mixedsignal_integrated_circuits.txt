INTRODUCTIONThe microelectronics market and, in particular, the markets for applicationspecific ICs ASICs, applicationspecific standard parts ASSPs, and highvolume commodityICs are characterized by an everincreasing level of integration complexity, now featuring multimillion transistor ICs.In recent years, complete systems that previously occupiedone or more boards have been integrated on a few chips oreven one single chip. Examples of such systems on a chipSoC are the singlechip TV or the singlechip camera 1or new generations of integrated telecommunication systemsthat include analog, digital, and eventually radiofrequencyRF sections on one chip.

Although most functions in such integrated systems are implemented with digital or digital signalprocessing DSP circuitry, the analog circuits needed atthe interface between the electronic system and the realworld are also being integrated on the same die for reasonsof cost and performance. A typical future SoC might looklike Fig. 1, containing several embedded processors, severalchunks of embedded memory, some reconfigurable logic,and a few analog interface circuits to communicate with thecontinuousvalued external world.Despite the trend previously to replace analog circuitfunctions with digital computations e.g., digital signalprocessing in place of analog filtering, there are sometypical functions that will always remain analog. The first typically analog function is on the input sideof a system signals from a sensor, microphone, antenna, wireline, and the like, must be sensed or received and then amplified and filtered up to a level thatallows digitization with sufficient signaltonoiseanddistortion ratio. Typical analog circuits used here arelownoise amplifiers, variablegain amplifiers, filters,oscillators, and mixers in case of downconversion.Applications are, for instance, instrumentation e.g.,data and biomedical, sensor interfaces e.g., airbag accelerometers, process control loops, telecommunication receivers e.g., telephone or cable modems, wireless phones, settop boxes, etc., recording e.g., speechrecognition, cameras, and smart cards. The second typically analog function is on the outputside of a system the signal is reconverted from digital to analog form and it has to be strengthened sothat it can drive the outside load e.g., actuator, antenna, loudspeaker, wireline without too much distortion. Typical analog circuits used here are drivers andbuffers, filters, oscillators and mixers in case of upconversion. Applications are, for instance, process control001892190010.00  2000 IEEEPROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000 1825Fig. 1. Future systemonachip.loops e.g., voltage regulators for engines, telecommunication transmitters, audio and video e.g., CD, DVD,loudspeakers, TV, PC monitors, etc., and biomedicalactuation e.g., hearing aids. The third type of blocks are the true mixedsignalcircuits that interface the above analog circuits withthe DSP part of the system. Typical circuits usedhere are the sampleandhold circuits for signalsampling, analogtodigital converters for amplitudediscretization, digitaltoanalog converters for signalreconstruction, and phaselocked loops and frequencysynthesizers to generate a timing reference or performtiming synchronization. In addition, the above circuits need stable absolutereferences for their operation, which are generated byvoltage and current reference circuits, crystal oscillators, etc. Finally, the largest analog circuits today are highperformance highspeed, lowpower digital circuits.Typical examples are stateoftheart microprocessors,which are largely custom sized like analog circuits, topush speed or power limits.Clearly, analog circuits are indispensable in all electronicapplications that interface with the outside world and willeven be more prevalent in our lives if we move toward theintelligent homes, the mobile roadair offices, and the wireless workplaces of the future.When both analog possibly RF and digital circuits areneeded in a system, it becomes obvious to integrate themtogether to reduce cost and improve performance, providedthe technology allows us to do so. The growing market shareof integrated mixedsignal ICs observed today in modernelectronic systems for telecommunications, consumer, computing, and automotive applications, among many others,is a direct result of the need for higher levels of integration2. Since the early 1990s, the average growth rate of themixedsignal IC market has been between 15 and 20per year, and this market is predicted to surpass 22 billionby 2001. Recent developments in CMOS technology haveoffered the possibility to combine good and scalable digitalperformance with adequate analog performance on thesame die. The shrinking of CMOS device sizes down tothe deep submicrometer regime essentially in line with,or even ahead of, the predicted technology roadmap 3makes higher levels of system integration possible and alsooffers analog MOS transistor performance that approachesthe performance of a bipolar transistor. This explains whyCMOS is the technology of choice today, and why othertechnologies like BiCMOS are only used when more aggressive bipolar device characteristics e.g., power, noise,or distortion are really needed. The technology shift frombipolar to CMOS or BiCMOS has been apparent in mostapplications. Even fields like RF, where traditionally GaAsand bipolar were the dominant technologies, now show atrend toward BiCMOS preferably with a SiGe option andeven plain CMOS for reasons of higher integration and costreduction. These higher levels of mixedsignal integration,however, also introduce a whole new set of problems anddesign effects that need to be accounted for in the designprocess.Indeed, together with the increase in circuit complexity, the design complexity of todays ICs has increaseddrastically 1 due to integration, more and more transistors are combined per IC, performing both analog anddigital functions, to be codesigned together with the embedded software 2 new signal processing algorithmsand corresponding system architectures are developed toaccommodate new required functionalities and performancerequirements including power of emerging applicationsand 3 due to the rapid evolution of process technologies,the expectation for changing process technology parametersneeds to be accounted for in the design cycle. At the sametime, many ASIC and ASSP application markets are characterized by shortening product life cycles and tighteningtimetomarket constraints. The timetomarket factor isvery critical for ASICs and ASSPs that eventually end upin consumer, telecom, or computer products if one missesthe initial market window relative to the competition, pricesand, therefore, profit can be seriously eroded.The key to managing this increased design complexitywhile meeting the shortening timetomarket factor is theuse of computeraided design CAD and verificationtools. Todays highspeed workstations provide amplepower to make large and detailed computations possible.What is needed to expedite the analog and mixedsignaldesign process is a structured methodology and supportingCAD tools to manage the entire design process and designcomplexity. CAD tools are also needed to assist or automatemany of the routine and repetitive design tasks, taking awaythe tedium of manually designing these sections and providing the designer with more time to focus on the creativeaspects of design. ICs typically are composed of manyidentical circuit blocks used across different designs. Thedesign of these repetitive blocks can be automated to reducethe design time. In addition, CAD tools can increase the productivity of designers, even for nonrepetitive analog blocks.Therefore, analog CAD and circuit design automation arelikely to play a key role in the design process of the nextgeneration of mixedsignal ICs and ASICs. And although thedesign of mixedsignal ASICs served as the initial impetusfor stepping up the efforts in research and development of1826 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000analog design automation tools, the technology trend towardintegrating complete systems on a chip in recent years hasprovided yet another driving force to bolster analog CADefforts. In addition, for such systems new design paradigmsare being developed that greatly affect how we will designanalog blocks. One example is the macrocell design reusemethodology of assembling a system by reusing soft orhard macrocells virtual components that are availableon the intellectual property IP market and that can easilybe mixed and matched in the silicon board system if theycomply with the virtual socket inferface VSI standard4. This methodology again poses many new constraints,also on the analog blocks. Platformbased design is anotheremerging systemlevel design methodology 5.In the digital domain, CAD tools are fairly well developedand commercially available today, certainly for the lowerlevels of the design flow. First, the digital IC market is muchlarger than the analog IC market. In addition, unlike analogcircuits, a digital system can naturally be represented in termsof Boolean representation and programming language constructs, and its functionality can easily be represented in algorithmic form, thus paving the way for a logical transition into automation of many aspects of digital system design. At the present time, many lowerlevel aspects of thedigital design process are fully automated. The hardware isdescribed in a hardware description language HDL suchas VHDL or Verilog, either at the behavioral level or mostoften at the structural level. Highlevel synthesis tools attempt to synthesize the behavioral HDL description into astructural representation. Logic synthesis tools then translatethe structural HDL specification into a gatelevel netlist, andsemicustom layout tools place and route map this netlistinto a correctbyconstruction masklevel layout based on acell library specific for the selected technology process. Research interest is now moving in the direction of system synthesis where a systemlevel specification is translated into ahardwaresoftware coarchitecture with highlevel specifications for the hardware, the software, and the interfaces. Reusemethodologies and platformbased design methodologies arebeing developed to further reduce the design effort for complex systems. Of course, the level of automation is far fromthe pushbutton stage, but the developments are keeping upreasonably well with the chip complexity offered by the technology.Unfortunately, the story is quite different on the analogside. There are not yet any robust commercial CAD tools tosupport or automate analog circuit design apart from circuitsimulators in most cases, some flavor of the ubiquitousSPICE simulator 6 and layout editing environments andtheir accompanying tools e.g., some limited optimizationcapabilities around the simulator, or layout verification tools.Some of the main reasons for this lack of automation arethat analog design in general is perceived as less systematicand more heuristic and knowledgeintensive in nature thandigital design, and that it has not yet been possible for analogdesigners to establish a higher level of abstraction thatshields all the devicelevel and processlevel details from thehigher level design. Analog IC design is a complex endeavor,requiring specialized knowledge and circuit design skillsacquired through many years of experience. The variety ofcircuit schematics and the number of conflicting requirementsand corresponding diversity of device sizes is also muchlarger. In addition, analog circuits are more sensitive tononidealities and all kinds of higher order effects and parasiticdisturbances crosstalk, substrate noise, supply noise, etc..These differences from digital design also explain why analogCAD tools cannot simply adapt the digital algorithms, butwhy specific analog solutions need to be developed thatare targeted to the analog design paradigm and complexity.The analog CAD field, therefore, had to evolve on itsown, but it turned into a niche field as the analog ICmarket was smaller than the digital one. As a result, dueto the lack of adequate and mature commercial analogCAD tools, analog designs today are still largely beinghandcrafted with only a SPICElike simulation shell and aninteractive layout environment as supporting facilities. Thedesign cycle for analog and mixedsignal ICs remainslong and errorprone. Therefore, although analog circuitstypically occupy only a small fraction of the total areaof mixedsignal ICs, their design is often the bottleneckin mixedsignal systems, both in design time and effortas well as test cost, and they are often responsible fordesign errors and expensive reruns.The economic pressure for highquality yet cheapelectronic products and the decreasing timetomarketconstraints have clearly revealed the need in the presentmicroelectronics industry for analog CAD tools to assistdesigners with fast and firsttimecorrect design of analogcircuits, or even to automate certain tasks of this designprocess where possible. The push for more and more integrated systems containing both analog and digital circuitryheavily constrains analog designers. To keep pace withthe digital world and to fully exploit the potential offeredby the present deep submicrometer VLSI technologies,boosting analog design productivity is a major concern inthe industry today. The design time and cost for analogcircuits from specification to successful silicon has to bereduced drastically. The risk for design errors impedingfirstpass functional and possibly also parametricallycorrect chips has to be eliminated. Second, analog CADtools can also help to increase the quality of the resultingdesigns. Before starting detailed circuit implementation,more higherlevel explorations and optimizations shouldbe performed at the system architectural level, preferrablyacross the analogdigital boundary, since decisions at thoselevels have a much larger impact on key overall systemparameters such as power consumption and chip area.Likewise, designs at lower levels should be automatedwhere possible. Designers find difficulty in consideringmultiple conflicting tradeoffs at the same timecomputersdo not. Computers are adept at trying out and exploringlarge numbers of competing alternatives. Typical examplesare finetuning through optimization of an initial handcrafted design and improving design robustness with respectto operating parameter variations temperature, supplyvoltage andor with respect to manufacturing tolerances andGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1827Fig. 2. SIA synthesis potential solutions roadmap 3.mismatches. Third, the continuous pressure of technologyupdates and process migrations is a large burden on analogdesigners. CAD tools could take over a large part of thetechnology retargeting effort, and could make analog designeasier to port or migrate to new technologies. Finally, theSoC design reuse methodology also requires executablemodels and other information for the analog macrocells tobe used in systemlevel design and verification. Tools andmodeling techniques have to be developed to make thispossible. This need for analog CAD tools beyond simulationhas also clearly been identified in the SIA roadmap, asindicated in Fig. 2, where analog synthesis is predicted totake off somewhere beyond the year 2000 3.Despite the lack of commercial analog CAD tools, analogCAD and design automation over the past 15 years hasbeen a field of profound academic and industrial researchactivity, although with not quite as many researchers as inthe digital world, resulting in a slow but steady progress7. Some of the aspects of the analog CAD field are fairlymature, some are ready for commercialization, while othersare still in the process of exploration and development.The simulation area has been particularly well developedsince the advent of the SPICE simulator, which has ledto the development of many simulators, including timingsimulators in the digital field and the newer generation ofmixedsignal and multilevel commercial simulators. Analogcircuit and layout synthesis has recently shown promisingresults at the research level, but commercial solutions areonly starting to appear in the marketplace. The developmentof analog and mixedsignal hardware description languageslike VHDLAMS 8 and VerilogAMS 9 is intended toprovide a unifying trend that will link the various analogdesignautomation tasks inacoherent framework that supportsa more structured analog design methodology from thedesign conceptualization stage to the manufacturing stage.They also provide a link between the analog and the digitaldomains, as needed in designing mixed analogdigital ICsand the SoC of the future.In this survey, the relevant developments to date in analogand mixedsignal CAD will be covered in a general overview.The paper is organized as follows. Section II describes theanalog and mixedsignal integrated system design process, aswell as a hierarchical design strategy for the analog blocks.Section III then describes general progress and the currentstatus in the various fields of analog CAD simulation andmodeling, symbolic analysis, circuit synthesis and optimization, layout generation, yield analysis and design centering,and test and design for testability. This is illustrated with several examples. Most of the emphasis will be on circuit andlayout synthesis as it is key to analog design automation,while other topics such as test will only be covered brieflyin this paper. For the sake of completeness, we did not wantto omit those topics, but they require overview papers of theirown for detailed coverage. Conclusions are then provided inSection IV, and an extensive list of references completes thepaper.II. ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL DESIGN PROCESSWe will now first describe the design flow for mixedsignalintegrated systems from concept to chip, followed by the description of a hierarchical design methodology for the analogblocks that can be adopted by analog CAD systems.A. MixedSignal IC Design FlowFig. 3 illustrates a possible scenario for the design flow ofa complex analog or mixedsignal IC. The various stages thatare traversed in the design process are as follows.1 Conceptual Design This is typically the product conceptualization stage, where the specifications for a design1828 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000Fig. 3. Highlevel view of the analog or mixedsignal IC design process.are gathered and the overall product concept is developed.Careful checking of the specifications is crucial for the latersuccess of the product in its application context. Mathematical tools such as MatlabSimulink are often used at thisstage. This stage also includes setting project managementgoals such as final product cost and timetomarket, projectplanning, and tracking.2 System Design This is the first stage of the actualdesign, where the overall architecture of the system is designed and partitioned. Hardware and software parts are defined and both are specified in appropriate languages. Thehardware components are described at the behavioral level,and, in addition, the interfaces have to be specified. Thisstage includes decisions about implementation issues, suchas package selection, choice of the target technology, andgeneral test strategy. The systemlevel partitioning and specifications are then verified using detailed cosimulation techniques.3 Architectural Design This stage is the highleveldecomposition of the hardware part into an architectureconsisting of functional blocks required to realize the specified behavioral description. This includes the partitioningbetween analog and digital blocks. The specifications of thevarious blocks that compose the design are defined, and allblocks are described in an appropriate hardware descriptionlanguage e.g., VHDL and VHDLAMS. The highlevelarchitecture is then verified against the specifications usingbehavioral mixedmode simulations.4 Cell Design For the analog blocks, this is the detailedimplementation of the different blocks for the given specifications and in the selected technology process, resulting in afully sized devicelevel circuit schematic. The stage encompasses both a selection of the proper circuit topology and adedicated sizing of the circuit parameters. Throughout thisprocess, more complex analog blocks will be further decomposed into a set of subblocks. This whole process will bedescribed in more detail in Section IIB. Manufacturabilityconsiderations tolerances and mismatches are taken into account in order to guarantee a high yield andor robustness.The resulting circuit design is then verified against the specifications using SPICEtype circuit simulations.5 Cell Layout This stage is the translation of the electrical schematic of the different analog blocks into a geometrical representation in the form of a multilayer layout. Thisstage involves area optimization to generate layouts that occupy a minimum amount of chip realestate. The layout isfollowed by extraction of layout parasitics and detailed circuitlevel simulations of the extracted circuit in order to ensure that the performance characteristics do not deviate onaccount of layout parasitics.6 System Layout The generation of the systemlevellayout of an IC not only includes systemlevel block placeand route, but also powergrid routing. Crosstalk and substrate coupling analysis are important in mixedsignal ICs,and proper measures such as shielding or guarding must alsobe included. Also, the proper test structures are inserted tomake the IC testable. Interconnect parasitics are extractedand detailed verification e.g., timing analysis is performed.Finally, the system is verified by cosimulating the hardwarepart with the embedded software.GIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 18297 Fabrication and Testing This is the processing stagewhere the masks are generated and the ICs fabricated. Testingis performed during and after fabrication in order to rejectdefective devices.Note that any of the many simulation and verificationstages throughout this design cycle may detect potentialproblems with the design failing to meet the target requirements. In that case, backtracking or redesign will beneeded, as indicated by the upward arrow on the lefthandside of Fig. 3.B. Hierarchical Analog Design MethodologyThis section focuses on the design methodology adoptedfor the design of analog integrated circuits. These analog circuits could be part of a larger mixedsignal IC. Although atthe present time there is no clearcut general design methodology for analog circuits yet, we outline here the hierarchicaldesign methodology prevalent in many of the emerging experimental analog CAD systems 1015. For the design ofa complex analog macroblock such as a phaselocked loopor an analogtodigital converter, the analog block is typically decomposed into smaller subblocks e.g., a comparatoror a filter. The specifications of these subblocks are thenderived from the initial specifications of the original block,after which each of the subblocks can be designed on its own,possibly by further decomposing it into even smaller subblocks. In this way, constraints are passed down the hierarchyin order to make sure that the toplevel block in the end meetsthe specifications. This whole process is repeated down thedecomposition hierarchy until a level is reached that allowsa physical implementation either the transistor level or ahigher level in case analog standard cells or IP macrocells areused. The topdown synthesis process is then followed bya bottomup layout implementation and design verificationprocess. The need for detailed design verification is essentialsince manufacturing an IC is expensive, and a design needsto be ensured to be fully functional and meet all the designrequirements within a window of manufacturing tolerances,before starting the actual fabrication. When the design failsto meet the specifications at some point in the design flow,redesign iterations are needed.Most experimental analog CAD systems today use a performancedriven design strategy within such analog design hierarchy. This strategy consists of the alternation ofthe following steps in between any two levels and ofthe design hierarchy see Fig. 41 Topdown patha topology selectionb specification translation or circuit sizingc design verification.2 Bottomup patha layout generationb detailed design verification after extraction.Topology selection is the step of selecting the most appropriate circuit topology that can best meet the given specifications out of a set of already known alternative topologies.Fig. 4. Hierarchical design strategy for analog circuits.An alternative is that the designer develops hisher own newtopology. A topology can be defined hierarchically in termsof lowerlevel subblocks. For an analogtodigital converter,for instance, topology selection could be selecting betweena flash, a successive approximation, a or any othertopology that can best realize the specifications.Specification translation is then the step of mapping thespecifications for the block under design at a given levele.g., a converter into individual specifications for each ofthe subblocks e.g., a comparator within the selected blocktopology, so that the complete block meets its specifications, while possibly optimizing the design toward someapplicationspecific design objectives e.g., minimal powerconsumption. The translated specifications are then verifiedby means of behavioral or circuit simulations beforeproceeding down in the hierarchy. Behavioral simulationsare needed at higher levels in the design hierarchy whenno devicelevel implementation is available yet circuitsimulations are used at the lowest level in the design hierarchy. At this lowest level, the subblocks are single devicesand specification translation reduces to circuit sizing alsocalled circuit dimensioning, which is the determination ofall device sizes, element values, and bias parameters in thecircuit tuned to the given specifications.Layout generation is the step of generating the geometrical layout of the block under design, by assembling placeand route the already generated layouts of the composingsubblocks. At the lowest level, these subblocks are individualdevices or selected device groupings, which themselves aregenerated by parameterized procedural device layout generators. Also, power, ground, and substrate connection routing1830 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000is part of the layout generation step. This step is followed byextraction and, again, detailed verification and simulation tocheck the impact of the layout parasitics on the overall circuit performance.The above methodology is called performancedriven orconstraintdriven, as the performance specifications are thedriving input to each of the steps each step tries to perform its action e.g., circuit sizing or layout generation suchthat the input constraints are satisfied. This also implies thatthroughout the design flow, constraints need to be propagated down the hierarchy in order to maintain consistencyin the design as it evolves through the various design stagesand to make sure that the toplevel block in the end meetsits target specifications. These propagated constraints mayinclude performance constraints, but also geometrical constraints for the layout, or manufacturability constraints foryield, or even test constraints. Design constraint propagationis essential to ensure that specifications are met at each stageof the design, which would also reduce the number of redesign iterations. This is the ultimate advantage of topdowndesign catch problems early in the design flow and, therefore, have a higher chance of firsttime success, while obtaining a better overall system design.Ideally, one would like to have one clean topdown design path. However, this rarely occurs in practice, as a realistic design needs to account for a number of sometimeshardtoquantify secondorder effects as the design evolves.For instance, a choice of a particular topology for a functionblock may fail to achieve the required specifications or performance specifications may be too tight to achieve, in whichcase a redesign step is necessary to alter the block topologyor loosen the design specifications. In the above topdownbottomup design flow, redesign or backtracking iterations may therefore be needed at any point where a designstep fails to meet its input specifications. In that case, one ormore of the previously executed steps will have to be redone,for example, another circuit topology can be selected insteadof the failing one, or another partitioning of subblock specifications can be performed. One of the big differences between analog or mixedsignal designs and the more straighttopdown digital designs is exactly the larger number of design iterations needed to come to a good design solution. Theadoption of a topdown design methodology is precisely intended to reduce this disadvantage.A question that can be posed is why the analog circuitsneed to be redesigned or customized for every new application. The use of a library of carefully selected analog standardcells can be advantageous for certain applications, but is ingeneral inefficient and insufficient. Due to the large varietyand range of circuit specifications for different applications,any library will only have a partial coverage for each application, or it will result in an excess power andor area consumption that may not be acceptable for given applications.Many highperformance applications require an optimal design solution for the analog circuits in terms of power, area,and overall performance. A librarybased approach wouldrequire an uneconomically large collection of infrequentlyused cells. Instead, analog circuits are better custom tailoredtoward each specific application and tools should be available to support this. In addition, the porting of the librarycells whenever the process changes is a serious effort, thatwould also require a set of tools to automate.The following section in this survey paper will describe theprogress and the current state of the art in CAD tool development for the main tasks needed in the above analog designmethodology simulation and modeling, symbolic analysis,circuit synthesis, layout generation, yield estimation and design centering, test, and design for testability.III. CURRENT STATUS FOR THE MAIN TASKS IN ANALOGDESIGN AUTOMATIONA. Numerical Simulation of Analog and MixedSignalCircuitsA key to ensuring design correctness is the use of simulation tools. Simulation tools have long been in use in the ICdesign process and provide a quick and costeffective meansof design verification without actual fabrication of the device. The most widely used analog CAD tool today, therefore, is a circuit simulator that numerically calculates the response of the circuit to an input stimulus in the time or frequency domain. In the design methodology of Fig. 4, simulation plays a key role. First of alland this has been itstraditional rolesimulation is critical for detailed verification after a design has been completed before layout as wellas after extraction from the layout. Analog integrated circuits are typically impacted by many higher order effectsthat can severely degrade the circuit performance once fabricated, if the effects are not properly accounted for during thedesign process. Circuit simulation is a good design aid hereby providing the capability of simulating many of the higherorder effects and verifying circuit performance prior to fabrication, provided the effects are modeled properly. Second,a result of adopting the topdown design paradigm, simulation is needed to explore tradeoffs and verify designs at a highlevel, before proceeding with the detailed implementation ofthe lowerlevel subblocks. The latter also implies a higherlevel of modeling for the analog blocks. Finally, executablesimulation models are also part of the interface needed toenable the integration of complex systems on a chip by combining IP macrocells.1 Circuit Simulation Circuit simulation began with theearly development of the SPICE simulator 6, 16, and17, which spawned many of the CAD and IC design efforts and has been the cornerstone of many of todays IC designs. The SPICE simulator is to an analog designer what acalculator is to an engineering school sophomore. Advancesin mathematics and the development of many new and efficient numerical algorithms as well as advances in interfacese.g., user interfaces, waveform displays, script languages,etc. have over the years contributed to a vast number of commercial CAD tools. Many variants of the SPICE simulatorare now marketed by a number of CAD vendors many of theIC manufacturers have inhouse versions of the SPICE simulator that have been adapted to their own proprietary processes and designs. These simulators have been finetuned toGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1831Table 1Different Analog Hardware Description Levelsmeet the convergence criteria of the many difficulttosimulate ICs. SPICE or its many derivatives have evolved intoan established designer utility that is being used both duringthe design phase often in a designerguided trialanderrorfashion and for extensive postlayout design verification.A problem that has frustrated analog designers for manyyears is the limited accuracy of the semiconductor devicemodels used in these simulators, especially for smallsignalparameters and on the boundary between different operatingregions of the devices where the earlier models had discontinuities. Fortunately, recent models such as BSIM3 v3,Philips model 9 or EKV look more promising for analogdesign by providing smooth and continuous transitions between different operating regions 18. For RF applications,however, even these models are not accurate enough, and thelatest research work concentrates on analyzing and modelingthe extra effects that become important at higher operatingfrequencies e.g., the distributed gate, the resistive bulk, andnonquasistatic effects 19.With the explosion of mixedsignal designs, the need hasalso arisen for simulation tools that allow not only simulation of analog or digital circuits separately, but also simulation of truly mixed analogdigital designs 20. Simulating the large digital parts with full SPICE accuracy results in very long overall simulation times, whereas efficienteventdriven techniques exist to simulate digital circuits athigher abstraction levels than the transistor level. Therefore,mixedmode simulators were developed that glue together anaccurate SPICElike analog simulator to an efficient digitalsimulator. These socalled glued mixedmode simulatorsaddress the conversions of the signals between analog anddigital signal representations and of the appropriate loadingeffects by inserting interface elements at the boundaries between analog and digital circuitry. Also, the synchronizationbetween the analog kernel with its tiny integration steps andthe digital kernel with its events determines the efficiencyof the overall simulation. Such synchronization is needed ateach time point when an event crosses the boundary betweenanalog or digital. Today, the trend clearly is toward a moreunified level of algorithm integration with singlekernel multiplesolver solutions, and commercial solutions followingthat line have recently appeared in the marketplace.2 Circuit Modeling In recent years, the need has alsoarisen for higher levels of abstraction to describe andsimulate analog circuits. There are three reasons for this.In a topdown design methodology at higher levels of thedesign hierarchy, where the detailed lowerlevel circuitimplementations are yet unknown, there is a need forhigherlevel models describing the pintopin behavior ofthe circuits rather than the yet unknown internal structuralimplementation. Second, the verification of integratedmixedsignal systems also requires higher description levelsfor the analog sections, since such integrated systems arecomputationally too complex to allow a full simulation ofthe entire mixedsignal design in practical terms. Third,when providing or using analog IP macrocells in a SoCcontext, the virtual component has to be accompanied byan executable model that efficiently models the pintopinbehavior of the virtual component. This model can then beused in systemlevel design and verification, even withoutknowing the detailed circuit implementation of the macrocell.To solve those three problems, modeling paradigms andlanguages from the digital world have migrated to the analogdomain. For this reason, macro, behavioral, and functionalsimulation levels have been developed for analog circuits besides the wellknown circuit level 21. For a commercialsimulator to be useful in current industrial mixedsignal design practice, it therefore has to be capable of simulating asystem containing a mix of analog blocks described at different levels and in different domains, in combination withdigital blocks. This requires a true mixedsignal, multilevel,mixeddomain simulator.Table 1 gives an overview of the different analog description levels, both for continuoustime and discretetimeanalog circuits 21. In a macromodel, an equivalent butcomputationally cheaper circuit representation is usedthat has approximately the same behavior as the original1832 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000circuit. Equivalent sources combine the effect of severalother elements that are eliminated from the netlist. Thesimulation speedup is roughly proportional to the numberof nonlinear devices that can be eliminated. In a behavioralor functional model, a purely mathematical descriptionof the inputoutput behavior of the block is used. Thistypically will be in the form of a set of differentialalgebraic equations DAE andor transfer functions. At thebehavioral level, conservation laws still have to be satisfiedon the pins connecting different blocks. At the functionallevel, this is no longer the case and the simulated systemturns into a kind of signalflow diagram. Fig. 5 shows anexample of the output response of a CMOS currentsteeringdigitaltoanalog converter, modeled at the full device levelFig. 5b and at the behavioral level Fig. 5a. The responsesare quite similar the error between the two timedomainresponses for the same input signal is less than 1, whilethe behavioral model simulates about 1000 times faster.To allow an easy exchange of these models across different simulators and different users, the need arose forstandardized analog hardware description languages inwhich to describe these higherlevel models. These languagestandards have to provide a consistent way of representingand sharing design information across the different designtasks and across the design hierarchy, and, therefore, providea unifying trend to link the various tools in a global analogCAD system. For mixedsignal designs, the analog HDLshad to be compatible with the existing digital HDLs such asVHDL and Verilog. Several parallel analog or mixedsignalHDL language standardization efforts, therefore, have beeninitiated, recently resulting in the standardized languagesVHDLAMS 8 and VerilogAMS 9. The VHDLAMSlanguage targets the mixedsignal domain and is a supersetof the digital VHDL language. VerilogA for the analogpart and VerilogMS for the mixedsignal part target compatibility with the Verilog language. Recently, also, thestandardization of an extension of VDHLAMS toward RFhas been started.One of the remaining difficulties with higherlevel analogmodeling is the automatic characterization of analog circuitsand more particularly the automatic generation of analogmacromodels or behavioral models from a given design.This is a difficult problem area that needs to be addressed inthe near future, as it might turn out to be the biggest hurdlefor the adoption of these highlevel modeling methodologiesand AHDLs in industrial design practice. Current approachescan roughly be divided into fitting approaches and constructive approaches. In the fitting approaches, a parameterizedmodel for example, a rational transfer function, a more general set of equations, or even a neural network model is firstproposed by the model developer and the values of the parameters are then fitted by some leastsquare error optimization so that the model response matches as closely as possible the response of the real circuit 2224. The problemwith this approach is that first a good model template mustbe proposed. The second class of methods, therefore, triesto generate or build a model from the underlying circuit description. One approach, for instance, uses symbolic simpliabFig. 5.

The horizontal axis is time inseconds.fication techniques to simplify the physical equations that describe the circuit up to a maximum error bound 25. Up untilnow, however, the gains in CPU time were not high enoughfor practical circuits. More research in this area is definitelyneeded.3 Dedicated Simulation Techniques In addition tothe above generalpurpose simulation tools for analogand mixedsignal circuits, other techniques or tools havebeen developed for dedicated purposes. An important classof circuits that are used in many signal processing andcommunication systems are the switched circuits, likeswitchedcapacitor and, more recently, switchedcurrentcircuits. Their switched nature, with the resulting switchingtransients, requires many small numerical integration stepsto be simulated within each clock phase if a standard SPICEsimulator is used. On the other hand, advantage can betaken of the periodically switched nature of the circuits andthe fact that in a timediscrete circuit the signals are onlyimportant and, thus, only have to be calculated at specifictime points e.g., the end of each clock phase. This isexploited in several switchedcapacitor simulation tools likeSWITCAP 26, 27 and SWAP 28 but also in dedicatedtools like TOSCA that analyzes switchedcapacitorbasedconverters 29.Another important domain is RF simulation, needed forinstance when developing circuits for wireless applications,where modulated signals have to be simulated and effectslike noise, distortion, and intermodulation become imporGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1833tant. Here, techniques have been developed to directly simulate the steadystate behavior of these circuits without havingto wait for the decay of the initial transients 30, 31. In thetime domain, shooting methods are used for this, which tendto be more suited for strongly nonlinear circuits. In the frequency domain, harmonic balance methods are used, whichallow a simulation of the steadystate behavior of nonlinearcircuits driven by one or twotone signals but which historically required large CPU times and memory sizes for largecircuits or for strong nonlinearities. Recently, the implicitmatrix technique in combination with both shooting or harmonic balance methods extended the range of these methodsto much larger circuits 32. In parallel, other techniques havebeen developed such as the envelope simulation technique33, which combines time and frequency domain simulationto efficiently calculate the circuits response to truly modulated signals by separating the carrier from the modulationsignal. Other dedicated simulation algorithms have been developed for specific applications such as the highlevel analysis of entire analog RF receiver front ends in the ORCA tool34, or for the analysis of nonlinear noise and phase noisein both autonomous and driven circuits such as oscillators,mixers, and frequency synthesizers 35, 36.An important problem in deep submicrometer technologies where interconnect delays are exceeding gatedelays is the analysis of interconnect networks duringpostlayout timing verification. Accurate models for eachwire segment and the driving gates are needed, whichmakes the overall interconnect network too complex tosimulate. Therefore, recent developments try to improve theefficiency of timing verification while keeping the accuracyby using piecewiselinear models for gates and modelorderreduction techniques for the interconnect network 37. Thecomplexity of the interconnect network can be reduced bytechniques such as asymptotic waveform evaluation AWE38 or related variants such as Pad via Lanczos PVL, thatuse moment matching and Pad approximation to generatea lower order model for the response of a large linear circuitlike an interconnect network. The early AWE efforts usedexplicit moment matching techniques, which could generateunstable reducedorder models. Subsequent developmentsusing iterative methods resulted in methods like PVL thatovercome many of the deficiencies of the earlier AWEefforts, and stability is now guaranteed using techniqueslike Arnoldi transformations 39. The interconnect delayproblem has become so important that it is now driving thelayout generation to get intime timing closure, and that iteven is becoming essential for synthesis where, of course,estimation techniques must be used 40.An important problem in mixedsignal ICs is signal integrity analysis the analysis of crosstalk and couplings suchas capacitive or inductive interconnect couplings or couplings through the supply lines or the substrate. Crosstalkcan be a limiting factor in todays highspeed circuits withmany layers of interconnect. Substrate or supply couplingnoise is particularly important for analog circuits, especiallywhere they have to sense small input signals, such as in receiver front ends. Research has been going on to find efficientyet accurate techniques to analyze these problems, which depend on the geometrical configuration and, therefore, are inessence threedimensional fieldsolving problems. Typically,finite difference methods or boundary element methods areused to solve for the substrate potential distribution due to injected noise sources 4144. Recently, these methods havebeen speeded up with similar acceleration techniques as inRF or interconnect simulation, e.g., using an eigendecomposition technique 45. Their efficiency even allows one to perform some substrate design optimizations 46. A problem isthat the noisegenerating sources i.e., the switching noiseinjected by the digital circuitry are not accurately known,but vary with time depending on the input signals or the embedded programs, and, therefore, have to be estimated statistically. Some attempts to solve this problem characterizeevery cell in a digital standard cell library by the current theyinject in the substrate due to an input transition, and then calculate the total injection of a complex system by summingthe contributions of all switching cells over time 47.B. Symbolic Analysis of Analog CircuitsAnalog design is a very complex and knowledgeintensive process, which heavily relies on circuit understandingand related design heuristics. Symbolic circuit analysis techniques have been developed to help designers gain a betterunderstanding of a circuits behavior. A symbolic simulatoris a computer tool that takes as input an ordinary SPICEtype netlist and returns as output simplified analytic expressions for the requested circuit network functions in termsof the symbolic representations of the frequency variable andsome or all of the circuit elements 48, 49. They performthe same function that designers traditionally do by handanalysis even the simplification. The difference is that theanalysis is now done by the computer, which is much faster,can handle more complex circuits, and does not make asmany errors. An example of a complicated BiCMOS opampis shown in Fig. 6. The simplified analytic expression forthe differential smallsignal gain of this opamp has been analyzed with the SYMBA tool 50 and is shown belowThe symbolic expression gives a better insight into whichsmallsignal circuit parameters predominantly determine thegain in this opamp and how the user has to design the circuitto meet a certain gain constraint. In this way, symbolic circuitanalysis is complementary to numerical SPICE circuit simulation, which was described in the previous section. Symbolic analysis provides a different perspective that is moresuited for obtaining insight in a circuits behavior and for circuit explorations, whereas numerical simulation is more appropriate for detailed design validation once a design pointhas been decided upon. In addition, the generated symbolic1834 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000Fig. 6. BiCMOS operational amplifier to illustrate symbolic analysis.design equations also constitute a model of the circuits behavior that can be used in CAD tasks such as analog synthesis, statistical analysis, behavioral model generation, orformal verification 48.At this moment, only symbolic analysis of linear or smallsignal linearized circuits in the frequency domain is possible, both for continuoustime and discretetime switchedanalog circuits 48, 49, 51. In this way, symbolic expressions can be generated for transfer functions, impedances,noise functions, etc. In addition to understanding the firstorder functional behavior of an analog circuit, a good understanding of the secondorder effects in a circuit is equally important for the correct functioning of the design in its systemapplication later on. Typical examples are the PSRR and theCMRR of a circuit, which are limited by the mismatches between circuit elements. These mismatches are representedsymbolically in the formulas. Another example is the distortion or intermodulation behavior, which is critical in telecomapplications. The technique of symbolic simulation has beenextended to the symbolic analysis of distortion and intermodulation in weakly nonlinear analog circuits where the nonlinearity coefficients of the device smallsignal elements appearin the expressions 52.Exact symbolic solutions for network functions, however,are too complex for linearized circuits of practical size, andeven impossible to calculate for many nonlinear effects. Evenrather small circuits lead to an astronomically high numberof terms in the expressions, that can neither be handled bythe computer nor interpreted by the circuit designer. Therefore, since the late 1980s, and in principle similar to whatdesigners do during hand calculations, dedicated symbolicanalysis tools have been developed that use heuristic simplification and pruning algorithms based on the relative importance of the different circuit elements to reduce the complexity of the resulting expressions and retain only the dominant contributions within usercontrolled error tolerances.Examples of such tools are ISAAC 51, SYNAP 53, andASAP 54 among many others. Although successful for relatively small circuits, the fast increase of the CPU time withthe circuit size restricted their applicability to circuits between 10 and 15 transistors only, which was too small formany practical applications.In recent years, however, an algorithmic breakthrough inthe field of symbolic circuit analysis has been realized. Thetechniques of simplification before and during the symbolicexpression generation, as implemented in tools like SYMBA50 and RAINIER 55, highly reduce the computation timeand, therefore, enable the symbolic analysis of large analogcircuits of practical size like the entire 741 opamp or the example of Fig. 6. In simplification before generation SBG,the circuit schematic, or some associated matrix or graphs,are simplified before the symbolic analysis starts 56, 57.In simplification during generation SDG, instead of generating the exact symbolic expression followed by pruningthe unimportant contributions, the desired simplified expression is built up directly by generating the contributing dominant terms one by one in decreasing order of magnitude, untilthe expression has been generated with the desired accuracy50, 55.All these techniques, however, still result in large, expanded expressions, which restricts their usefulness forlarger circuits. Therefore, for really large circuits, thetechnique of hierarchical decomposition has been developed58, 59. The circuit is recursively decomposed into looselyconnected subcircuits. The lowestlevel subcircuits are analyzed separately and the resulting symbolic expressionsare combined according to the decomposition hierarchy.This results in the global nested expression for the completecircuit, which is much more compact than the expandedexpression. The CPU time increases about linearly with thecircuit size, provided that the coupling between the differentsubcircuits is not too strong. Another compact representationof symbolic expressions was presented recently. Followingthe use of binary decision diagrams in logic synthesis,determinant decision diagrams DDD have been proposedas a technique to canonically represent determinants in acompact nested format 60. The advantage is that all operations on these DDDs are linear with the size of the DDD,GIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1835but the DDD itself is not always linear with the size of thecircuit. This technique has been combined with hierarchicalanalysis in 61. Further investigation will have to prove theusefulness of this technique in practice.Based on the many research results in this area over the lastdecade, it can be expected that symbolic analysis techniqueswill soon emerge in the commercial EDA marketplace andthat they will soon be part of the standard tool suite of everyanalog designer. In the meantime, new possibly heuristicalgorithms for the symbolic analysis of transient and largesignal circuit characteristics are currently being developed inacademia.C. Analog Circuit Synthesis and OptimizationThe first step in the analog design flow of Fig. 4 is analogcircuit synthesis, which consists of two tasks topology selection and specification translation. Synthesis is a criticalstep since most analog designs require a custom optimizeddesign and the number of often conflicting performance requirements to be taken into account is large. Analog circuitsynthesis is the inverse operation of circuit analysis. Duringanalysis, the circuit topology and the subblock parameterssuch as device sizes and bias values are given and the resulting performance of the overall block is calculated, as isdone in the SPICE simulator. During synthesis, on the otherhand, the block performance is specified and an appropriatetopology to implement this block has to be decided first. Thisstep is called topology selection. Subsequently, values for thesubblock parameters have to be determined, so that the finalblock meets the specified performance constraints. This stepis called specification translation at higher levels in the design hierarchy, in which case performance specifications ofsubblocks have to be determined, or circuit sizing at the device level, in which case the sizes and biasing of all deviceshave to be determined. See Fig. 7 for an illustration of thisflow for lowlevel cells. The inversion process inherent tosynthesis, however, is not a onetoone mapping, but typically is an underconstrained problem with many degrees offreedom. The different analog circuit synthesis systems thathave been explored up till now can be classified based on howthey perform topology selection and how they eliminate thedegrees of freedom during specification translation or circuit sizing. In many cases, the initial sizing produces a nearoptimal design that is further finetuned with a circuit optimization tool. The performance of the resulting design isthen verified using detailed circuit simulations with a simulator such as SPICE, and when needed the synthesis processis iterated to arrive at a closefit design. We will now discussthe two basic steps in more detail.1 Topology Selection Given a set of performance specifications and a technology process, a designer or a synthesistool must first select a circuit schematic that is most suitableto meet the specifications at minimal implementation costpower, chip area. This problem can be solved by selecting aschematic from among a known set of alternative topologiessuch as stored in a library topology selection, or by generating a new schematic, for example by modifying an existing schematic. Although the earliest synthesis approachesFig. 7. Basic flow of analog circuit synthesis for a basic celltopology selection and circuit sizing.considered topology selection and sizing together, the task oftopology selection has received less attention in recent years,where the focus was primarily on the circuit sizing. Findingthe optimal circuit topology for a given set of performancespecifications is rather heuristic in nature and brings to bearthe real expert knowledge of a designer. Thus, it was onlynatural that the first topology selection approaches like inOASYS 10, BLADES 62, or OPASYN 63 were ratherheuristic in nature in that they used rules in one format or another to select a proper topology possibly hierarchically outof a predefined set of alternatives stored in the tools library.Later approaches worked in a more quantitative way inthat they calculate the feasible performance space of eachtopology that fits the structural requirements, and thencompare that feasible space to the actual input specificationsduring synthesis to decide on the appropriateness and theordering of each topology. This can for instance be doneusing interval analysis techniques 64 or using interpolationtechniques in combination with adaptive sampling 65. Inall these programs, however, topology selection is a separatestep. There are also a number of optimizationbased approaches that integrate topology selection with circuit sizingas part of one overall optimization loop. This was done usinga mixed integernonlinear programming formulation withBoolean variables representing topological choices 66,or by using a nested simulated evolutionannealing loopwhere the evolution algorithm looks for the best topologyand the annealing algorithm for the corresponding optimumdevice sizes 67. Another approach that uses a geneticalgorithm to find the best topology choice was presentedin DARWIN 68. Of these methods, the quantitative andoptimizationbased approaches are the more promisingdevelopments that address the topology selection task ina deterministic fashion as compared to the rather adhocheuristic methods.2 Analog Circuit Sizing Once an appropriate topologyhas been selected, the next step is specification translation,where the performance parameters of the subblocks in the selected topology are determined based on the specifications ofthe overall block. At the lowest level in the design hierarchy,this reduces to circuit sizing where the sizes and biasing of alldevices have to be determined such that the final circuit meetsthe specified performance constraints. This mapping fromperformance specifications into proper, preferrably optimal,device sizes and biasing for a selected analog circuit topology1836 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000abFig. 8. The two basic approaches toward analog circuit synthesisa the knowledgebased approach using procedural design plans,and b the optimizationbased approach.in general involves solving the set of physical equations thatrelate the device sizes to the electrical performance parameters. However, solving these equations explicitly is in general not possible, and analog circuit sizing typically results inan underconstrained problem with many degrees of freedom.The two basic ways to solve for these degrees of freedomin the analog sizing process are either by exploiting analogdesign knowledge and heuristics, or by using optimizationtechniques. These two basic methods, which are schematically depicted in Fig. 8, correspond to the two broad classesof approaches adopted toward analog circuit synthesis, i.e.,the knowledgebased approaches and the optimizationbasedapproaches 7, 69.a KnowledgeBased Analog Sizing Approaches Thefirst generation of analog circuit synthesis systems presentedin the mid to late 1980s were knowledgebased. Specificheuristic design knowledge about the circuit topology underdesign including the design equations but also the designstrategy was acquired and encoded explicitly in some computerexecutable form, which was then executed during thesynthesis run for a given set of input specifications to directlyobtain the design solution. This approach is schematicallyillustrated in Fig. 8a. The knowledge was encoded in different ways in different systems.The IDAC tool 70 used manually derived and prearranged design plans or design scripts to carry out the circuitsizing. The design equations specific for a particular circuittopology had to be derived and the degrees of freedom in thedesign had to be solved explicitly during the development ofthe design plan using simplifications and design heuristics.Once the topology was chosen by the designer, the designplan was loaded from the library and executed to producea firstcut design that could further be finetuned throughlocal optimization. The big advantage of using design plansis their fast execution speed, which allows for fastperformance space explorations. The approach also attemptsto take advantage of the knowledge of analog designers.IDACs schematic library was also quite extensive, and itincluded various analog circuits such as voltage references,comparators, etc., besides operational amplifiers. The bigdisadvantages of the approach are the lack of flexibilityin the hardcoded design plans and the large time neededto acquire the design equations and to develop a designplan for each topology and design target, as analog designheuristics are very difficult to formalize in a general andcontextindependent way. It has been reported 71 that thecreation of a design script or plan typically took four timesmore effort than is needed to actually design the circuitonce. A given topology must therefore at least be used infour different designs before it is profitable to develop thecorresponding design plan. Considering the large numberof circuit schematics in use in industrial practice, this largesetup time essentially restricted the commercial usabilityof the IDAC tool and limited its capabilities to the initialset of schematics delivered by the tool developer. Also, theintegration of the tool in a spreadsheet environment underthe name PlanFrame 72 did not fundamentally changethis. Note that due to its short execution times, IDAC wasintended as an interactive tool the user had to choose thetopology himherself and also had to specify values for theremaining degrees of freedom left open in the design plan.OASYS 10 adopted a similar designplanbased sizingapproach where every subblock in the library had its ownhandcrafted design plan, but the tool explicitly introduced hierarchy by representing topologies as an interconnection ofsubblocks. For example, a circuit like an opamp was decomposed into subcircuits like a differential pair, current mirrors,etc., and not represented as one big devicelevel schematicas in IDAC. OASYS also added a heuristic approach towardtopology selection, as well as a backtracking mechanism torecover from design failures. As shown in Fig. 9, the complete flow of the tool was then an alteration of topology selection and specification translation the latter by executingthe design plan associated with the topology down the hierarchy until the device level is reached. If the design does notmatch the desired performance characteristics at any stage inthis process, OASYS backtracks up the hierarchy, trying alternate configurations for the subblocks. The explicit use ofhierarchy allowed to reuse design plans of lowerlevel cellswhile building up higherlevelcell design plans and, therefore, also leveraged the number of devicelevel schematicscovered by one toplevel topology template. Although thetool was used successfully for some classes of opamps, comparators and even a data converter, collecting and orderingall the design knowledge in the design plans still remaineda huge manual and timeconsuming job, restricting the practical usefulness of the tool. The approach was later adoptedin the commercial MIDAS system 71, which was used successfully inhouse for certain types of data converters. Also,AZTECA 73 and CATALYST 74 use the designplan approach for the highlevel design of successiveapproximationand highspeed CMOS data converters, respectively. InspiredGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1837Fig. 9. Hierarchical alternation of topology selection and specification translation down the designhierarchy.by artificial intelligence research, also other ways to encodethe knowledge have been explored, such as in BLADES 62,which is a rulebased system to size analog circuits, in ISAID75, 76 or in 77.In all these methods, the heuristic design knowledge of ananalog designer turned out to be difficult to acquire and toformalize explicitly, and the manual acquisition process wasvery time consuming. In addition to analytic equationbaseddesign knowledge, procedural design knowledge is alsorequired to generate design plans, as well as specializedknowledge to support tasks such as failure handling andbacktracking. The overhead to generate all this was toolarge compared to a direct design of the circuit, restrictingthe tools basically to those circuits that were delivered bythe tool developers. Their coverage range was found to betoo small for the reallife industrial practice and, therefore,these first approaches failed in the commercial marketplace.b OptimizationBased Analog Sizing Approaches Inorder to make analog synthesis systems more flexible and extendible for new circuit schematics, an alternative approachwas followed starting in the late 1980s. This research resultedin a second generation of methods, the optimizationbasedapproaches. These use numerical optimization techniques toimplicitly solve for the degrees of freedom in analog designwhile optimizing the performance of the circuit under thegiven specification constraints. These strategies also striveto automate the generation of the required design knowledgeas much as possible, e.g., by using symbolic analysis techniques to automatically derive many of the design equationsand the sizing plans, or to minimize the explicitly requireddesign knowledge by adopting a more equationfree simulationoriented approach. This optimizationbased approach isschematically illustrated in Fig. 8b. At each iteration of theoptimization routine, the performance of the circuit has to beevaluated. Depending on which method is used for this performance evaluation, two different subcategories of methodscan be distinguished.In the subcategory of equationbased optimization approaches, simplified analytic design equations are usedto describe the circuit performance. In approaches likeOPASYN 63 and STAIC 78, the design equations stillhad to be derived and ordered by hand, but the degreesof freedom were resolved implicitly by optimization. TheOPTIMAN tool 79 added the use of a global simulatedannealing algorithm, but also tried to solve two remainingproblems. Symbolic simulation techniques were developedto automate the derivation of the simplified analytic designequations needed to evaluate the circuit performance at everyiteration of the optimization 69. Today, the ac behaviorboth linear and weakly nonlinear of relatively large circuitscan already be generated automatically. The second problemis then the subsequent ordering of the design equationsinto an applicationspecific design or evaluation plan. Also,this step was automated using constraint programmingtechniques in the DONALD tool 80. Together with a separate topologyselection tool based on boundary checkingand interval analysis 64 and a performancedriven layoutgeneration tool 81, all these tools are now integrated intothe AMGIE analog circuit synthesis system 82 that coversthe complete design flow from specifications over topologyselection and circuit sizing down to layout generation andautomatic verification. An example of a circuit that hasbeen synthesized with this AMGIE system is the particleradiation detector front end of Fig. 10, which consists of achargesensitive amplifier CSA followed by an stagepulseshaping amplifier PSA. All opamps are completecircuitlevel schematics in the actual design as indicated inthe figure. A comparison between the specifications andthe performances obtained by an earlier manual design ofan expert designer and by the fully computersynthesizedcircuit is given in Table 2. In the experiment, a reductionof the power consumption with a factor of 6 from 40 to 7mW was obtained by the synthesis system compared to themanual solution. Also, the final area is slightly smaller. Thelayout generated for this example is shown in Fig. 11.The technique of equationbased optimization has alsobeen applied to the highlevel synthesis of modulators in the SDOPT tool 83. The converter architectureis described by means of symbolic equations, which arethen used in a simulatedannealinglike optimization loopto derive the optimal subblock specifications from thespecifications of the converter. Recently, a first attempt waspresented toward the full behavioral synthesis of analogsystems from an annotated VHDLAMS behavioral description. The VASE tool follows a hierarchical twolayeredoptimizationbased designspace exploration approach to1838 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000Fig. 10. Particleradiation detector front end as example for analog circuit synthesis. The opamp andfilter stage symbols represent full circuit schematics as indicated.produce sized subblocks from behavioral specifications 84.A branchandbound algorithm with efficient solutionspacepruning first generates alternative system topologies bymapping the specifications via a signalflowgraph representation onto library elements. For each resulting topologya geneticalgorithmbased heuristic method is then executed for constraint transformation and subblock synthesis,which concurrently transforms systemlevel constraints intosubblock design parameters e.g., a bias current and fixesthe topologies and transistor sizes for all subblocks. Forreasons of efficiency the performances at all levels in theconsidered hierarchy are estimated using analytic equationsrelating design parameters to performance characteristics.The genetic algorithms operating at the different levels arespeeded up by switching from traditional genetic operatorsto directedintervalbased operators that rely on characterization tables with qualitative sensitivity information to helpfocusing the search process in promising local regions.In general, the big advantages of these analytic approachesare their fast evaluation time and their flexibility in manipulation possibilities. The latter is reflected in the freedom tochoose the independent input variables, which has a largeimpact on the overall evaluation efficiency 85, as well asthe possibility to perform more symbolic manipulations. Recently, it has been shown that the design of CMOS opampscan be formulated more precisely, it can be fairly well apGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1839Table 2Example of Analog Circuit Synthesis Experiment with the AMGIE SystemFig. 11. Layout of the particleradiation detector front endgenerated with the AMGIE analog synthesis system.proximated as a posynomial convex optimization problemthat can then be solved using geometric programming techniques, producing a closeby firstcut design in an extremelyefficient way 86. The initial optimization time literally reduces to seconds. The same approach has been applied tosome other circuits as well 87. The big drawback of the analytic methods, however, is that the design equations still haveto be derived and, despite the progress in symbolic circuitanalysis, not all design characteristics such as transient orlargesignal responses are easy to capture in analytic equations with sufficient accuracy. For such characteristics eitherrough approximations have to be used, which undermines thesense of the whole approach, or one has to fall back on numerical simulations. This problem has sparked research efforts to try to develop equationfree approaches.Therefore, in recent years and with improving computerpower, a second subcategory of simulationbased optimization approaches toward analog circuit synthesis has beendeveloped. These methods perform some form of full numerical simulation to evaluate the circuits performance inthe inner loop of the optimization see Fig. 8b. Althoughthe idea of optimizationbased design for analog circuitsdates back at least 30 years 88, it is only recently that thecomputer power and numerical algorithms have advancedfar enough to make this really practical. For a limited setof parameters circuit optimization was already possible inDELIGHT.SPICE 89. This method is most favorable infinetuning an already designed circuit to better meet thespecifications, but the challenge in automated synthesis isto solve for all degrees of freedom when no good initialstarting point can be provided. To this end, the FRIDGEtool 90 calls a plainvanilla SPICE simulation at everyiteration of a simulatedannealinglike global optimizationalgorithm. In this way, it is able to synthesize lowlevelanalog circuits e.g., opamps with full SPICE accuracy.Performance specifications are divided in design objectivesand strong and weak constraints. The number of requiredsimulations is reduced as much as possible by adopting afast cooling schedule with reheating to recover from localminima. Nevertheless, many simulations are performed, andthe number of optimization parameters and their range hasto be restricted in advance by the designer. The introductionof a new circuit schematic in such an approach is relativelyeasy, but the drawback remains the long run times, especiallyif the initial search space is large.An inbetween solution was therefore explored in theASTRXOBLX tool 91 where the simulation itself isspeeded up by analyzing the linear smallsignal characteristics more efficiently than in SPICE by using AsymptoticWaveform Evaluation 38. For all other characteristicsequations still have to be provided by the designer. So thisis essentially a mixed equationsimulation approach. TheASTRX subtool compiles the initial synthesis specification into an executable cost function. The OBLX subtoolthen numerically searches for the minimum of this costfunction via simulated annealing, hence determining theoptimal circuit sizing. To achieve accuracy in the solution,encapsulated industrystandard models are used for theMOS transistors. For efficiency the tool also uses a dcfreebiasing formulation of the analog design problem, where thedc constraints i.e., Kirchhoff current law KCL at everynode are not imposed by construction at each optimization iteration, but are solved by relaxation throughout theoptimization run by adding the KCL violations as penaltyterms to the cost function. At the final optimal solution,all the penalty terms are driven to zero, thus resulting in aKCLcorrect and thus electrically consistent circuit in theend. ASTRXOBLX has been applied successfully to a widevariety of celllevel designs, such as a gain stage 92,but the CPU times remain large. The tool is also most suitedonly when the circuit behavior is relatively linear, becausethe other characteristics still require equations to be derived.1840 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000Fig. 12. Example circuit for analog circuit synthesis.Table 3Example of Analog Circuit Synthesis Results with FRIDGE and MAELSTROMIn the quest for industrygrade quality, most recentapproaches, therefore, use complete SPICE simulations forall characteristics. To cut down on the large synthesis time,more efficient optimization algorithms are used andor thesimulations are executed as much as possible in parallel ona pool of workstations. In 93, the generalized boundarycurve is used to determine the step length within an iterativetrustregion optimization algorithm. Using the full nonlinearcost function based on the linearized objectives significantlyreduces the total number of iterations in the optimization.The ANACONDA tool, on the other hand, uses a globaloptimization algorithm based on stochastic pattern searchthat inherently contains parallelism and, therefore, can easilybe distributed over a pool of workstations, to try out andsimulate 50 000 to 100 000 circuit candidates in a few hours94. MAELSTROM is the framework that provides thesimulator encapsulation and the environment to distributeboth the search tasks of the optimization algorithm as well asthe circuit evaluations at every iteration of the optimizationover parallel workstations in a network 95. It uses anotherparallel global algorithm, a combined annealinggeneticalgorithm, to produce fairly good designs in a few hours.These bruteforce approaches require very little advancemodeling to prepare for any new circuit topology and havethe same accuracy as SPICE. Fig. 12 shows an example ofan opamp circuit that has been synthesized with FRIDGEand MAELSTROM. The results are summarized in Table 3.In 96, ANACONDAMAELSTROM, in combination withmacromodeling techniques to bridge the hierarchical levels,was applied to an industrialscale analog system the equalizerfilter front end for an ADSL CODEC. The experimentsdemonstrated that the synthesis results are comparable to, orsometimes better than, manual design. Although appealing,these methods still have to be used with care by designersbecause the run times and, therefore, also the debug timeremain long, and because the optimizer may easily produceimproper designs if the right design constraints are notadded to the optimization problem. Reducing the CPU timeremains a challenging area for further research.Other simulationbased approaches can be found in toolssuch as OAC 97, which is a specific nonlinear optimization tool for operational amplifiers and which is based on redesign starting from a previous design solution stored in thesystems database. It also performs physical floorplanningduring the optimization, which accounts for physical layouteffects during circuit synthesis. A recent application of thesimulationbased optimization approach to the highlevel optimization of analog RF receiver front ends was presented in98. A dedicated RF frontend simulator was developed andused to calculate the ratio of the wanted signal to the totalpower of all unwanted signals noise, distortion, aliasing,phase noise, etc. in the frequency band of interest. An optiGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1841mization loop then determines the optimal specifications forthe receiver subblocks such that the desired signal quality forthe given application is obtained at the lowest possible powerconsumption for the overall frontend topology. Behavioralmodels and power estimators are used to evaluate the different frontend subblocks at this high architectural level.In summary, the initial design systems like IDAC were tooclosed and restricted to their initial capabilities and, therefore, failed in the marketplace. The current trend is towardopen analog design systems that allow the designer to easilyextend andor modify the design capabilities of the systemwithout too much software overhead. Compared to the initialknowledgebased approaches, the big advantages of the morerecent optimizationbased approaches are their high flexibility and extendibility, both in terms of design objectivesby altering the cost function and in terms of the ease to addnew circuit schematics. Although some additional researchis still needed, especially to reduce the CPU times, it can beconcluded that a lot of progress has been achieved in the fieldof analog circuit synthesis during the past ten years. This hasresulted in the development of several experimental analogsynthesis systems, with which several designs have successfully been synthesized, fabricated, and measured. This hasbeen accomplished not only for opamps, but also for filters 99 and data converters 100. Based on these recentmethods, several commercial tools are currently being developed that will be introduced in the marketplace in the nearfuture.Finally, it has to be added that industrial design practicenot only calls for fully optimized nominal design solutions,but also expects high robustness and yield in the light ofvarying operating conditions supply voltage or temperaturevariations and statistical process tolerances and mismatches101. Techniques to analyze the impact of this on theyield or the capability index Cpk of the circuit 102 afterthe nominal design has been completed will be discussedin detail in Section IIIE. Here, we briefly describe theefforts to integrate these considerations in the synthesisprocess itself. Yield and robustness precautions were alreadyhardcoded in the design plans of IDAC 70, but are moredifficult to incorporate in optimizationbased approaches.Nevertheless, first attempts in this direction have alreadybeen presented. The ASTRXOBLX tool has been extendedwith manufacturability considerations and uses a nonlinearinfinite programming formulation to search for the worstcase corners at which the evolving circuit should beevaluated for correct performance 103. The approach hasbeen successful in several test cases but does increase therequired CPU time even further roughly by  .Also, the OPTIMAN program has been extended by fullyexploiting the availability of the analytic design equationsto generate closedform expressions for the sensitivitiesof the performances to the process parameters 104. Theimpact of tolerances and mismatches on yield or Cpk canthen easily be calculated at each optimization iteration,which then allows to synthesize the circuits simultaneouslyfor performance and for manufacturability yield or Cpk.The accuracy of the statistical predictions still has to beimproved. The approach in 93 uses parameter distances asrobustness objectives to obtain a nominal design that satisfies all specifications with as much safety margin as possiblefor process variations. The resulting formulation is the sameas for design centering and can be solved efficiently usingthe generalized boundary curve. Design centering, however,still remains a second step after the nominal design. Moreresearch in this direction, therefore, is still needed.D. Analog and MixedSignal Layout SynthesisThe next important step in the analog design flow of Fig. 4after the circuit synthesis is the generation of the layout. Thefield of analog layout synthesis is more mature than circuitsynthesis, in large part because it has been able to leverageideas from the mature field of digital layout. Yet, realcommercial solutions are only beginning to appear in recentyears. Below we distinguish analog circuitlevel layoutsynthesis, which has to transform a sized transistorlevelschematic into a mask layout, and systemlevel layoutassembly, in which the basic functional blocks are alreadylaid out and the goal is to floorplan, place, and route them,as well as to distribute the power and ground connections.1 Analog CircuitLevel Layout Synthesis The earliestapproaches to analog cell layout synthesis relied on procedural module generation, like in 105, in which the layoutof the entire circuit was precoded in a software tool that generates the complete layout at run time for the actual parametervalues entered. This approach is today frequently used duringinteractive manual layout for the singlekeystroke generationof the entire layout of a single device or a special group ofe.g., matched devices by means of parameterized procedural device generators. For circuits, however, the approachis not flexible enough, and large changes in the circuit parameters e.g., device sizes may result in inefficient area usage.In addition, a module generator has to be written and maintained for each individual circuit.A related set of methods are called template driven. Foreach circuit, a geometric template e.g., a sample layout 71or a slicing tree 63 is stored that fixes the relative positionand interconnection of the devices. The layout is then completed by correctly generating the devices and the wires forthe actual values of the design according to this fixed geometric template, thereby trying to use the area as efficientlyas possible. These approaches work best when the changesin circuit parameters result in little need for global alterationsin the general circuit layout structure, which is the case forinstance during technology migration or porting of existinglayouts, but which is not the case in general.In practice, changes in the circuits device sizes oftenrequire large changes in the layout structure in order to getthe best performance and the best area occupation. Theperformance of an analog circuit is indeed impacted bythe layout. Parasitics introduced by the layout, such as theparasitic wire capacitance and resistance or the crosstalkcapacitance between two neighboring or crossing wires, canhave a negative impact on the performance of analog circuits.It is, therefore, of utmost importance to generate analog1842 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000circuit layouts such that 1 the resulting circuit still satisfiesall performance specifications and 2 the resulting layoutis as compact as possible. This requires fullcustom layoutgeneration, which can be handled with a macrocellstylelayout strategy. The terminology is borrowed from digitalfloorplanning algorithms, which manipulate flexible layoutblocks called macros, arrange them topologically andthen route them. For analog circuits, the entities to be handled are structural groups of one single or a special groupingof devices e.g., a matching pair of transistors. Thesedevicelevel macros are to be folded, oriented, placed, andinterconnected to make up a good overall layout. Note thatmany analog devices and special device groupings, even forthe same set of parameters, can be generated in differentgeometrical variants, e.g., two matching devices can be laidout in interdigitated form, or stacked, or in a quadsymmetricfashion, etc. For each variant of each macrocell structureused, procedural module generators have to be developedto generate the actual layouts of the cells for a given setof parameter values. A drawback is that these generatorshave to be maintained and updated whenever the technologyprocess changes, which creates some pressure to limit thenumber of different generators. Whatever the macrocellsconsidered in a custom analog circuit layout synthesis tool,a placement routine optimally arranges the cells, while alsoselecting the most appropriate geometrical variant for eacha router interconnects them, and sometimes a compactorcompacts the resulting layout, all while taking care of themany constraints like symmetry and matching typical foranalog circuits, and also attending to the numerous parasiticsand couplings to which analog circuits unfortunately aresensitive. This general analog circuit layout synthesis flowis shown in Fig. 13.The need to custom optimize analog layouts led to the optimizationbased macrocellplaceandroute layout generation approaches where the layout solution is not predefined by some template, but determined by an optimizationprogram according to some cost function. This cost function typically contains minimum area and net length and adherence to a given aspect ratio, but also other terms couldbe added, and the user normally can control the weightingcoefficients of the different contributions. The advantage ofthe optimizationbased approaches is that they are generally applicable and not specific to a certain circuit, and thatthey are flexible in terms of performance and area as theyfind the most optimum solution at run time. The penalty topay is their larger CPU times, and the dependence of thelayout quality on the setup of the cost function. Examplesof such tools are ILAC 106 and the different versions ofKOANANAGRAM 107. ILAC borrowed heavily from thebest ideas from digital layout efficient slicingtree floorplanning with flexible blocks, global routing via maze routing,detailed routing via channel routing, area optimization viacompaction 106. The problem with the approach was thatit was difficult to extend these primarilydigital algorithms tohandle all the lowlevel geometric optimizations that characterize expert manual design. Instead, ILAC relied on a large,very sophisticated library of device generators.Fig. 13. General flow of an analog circuit layout synthesis tool.ANAGRAM and its successor KOANANAGRAM II keptthe macrocell style, but reinvented the necessary algorithmsfrom the bottom up, incorporating many manual design optimizations 107109. The device placer KOAN relied ona very small library of device generators and migrated important layout optimizations into the placer itself. KOAN,which was based on an efficient simulated annealing algorithm, could dynamically fold, merge, and abut MOS devicesand, thus, discover desirable optimizations to minimize parasitic capacitance on the fly during optimization. Its companion, ANAGRAM II, was a mazestyle detailed area routercapable of supporting several forms of symmetric differentialrouting, mechanisms for tagging compatible and incompatible classes of wires e.g., noisy and sensitive wires, parasitic crosstalk avoidance and overthedevice routing. Also,other device placers and routers operating in the macrocellstyle have appeared e.g., LADIES 110 and ALSYN 111.Results from these tools can be quite impressive. For example, Fig. 14 shows two versions of the layout of an industrial 0.25 m CMOS comparator. On the left is a manuallycreated layout, on the right is a layout generated automicallywith a commercial tool operating in the macrocell style. Theautomatic layout compares well to the manual one.An important improvement in the next generation of optimizationbased layout tools was the shift from a rather qualitative consideration of analog constraints to an explicit quantitative optimization of the performance goals, resulting inthe performancedriven or constraintdriven approaches.For example, KOAN maximized MOS drainsource mergingduring layout and ANAGRAM II minimized crosstalk, butwithout any specific, quantitative performance targets. Theperformancedriven approaches, on the other hand, explicitly quantify the degradation of the performance due to layoutparasitics and the layout tools are driven such that this extralayoutinduced performance degradation is within the margins allowed by the designers performance specifications112. In this way, more optimum solutions can be foundas the importance of each layout parasitic is weighed according to its impact on the circuit performance, and the toolscan much better guarantee by construction that the circuitGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1843Fig. 14. Manual left versus automatic right layout for anindustrial 0.25 m CMOS analog comparator.will meet the performance specifications also after the layoutphase if possible.Tools that adopt this approach include the area routerROAD 113, the placement tool PUPPYA 114 and thecompaction tool SPARCSA 115. The routers ROAD113 and ANAGRAM III 116 have a cost function thatdrives them such that they minimize the deviation fromacceptable bounds on wire parasitics. These bounds areprovided by designers or derived from the margins on theperformance specifications via sensitivities. The LAYLAsystem 81, 117, 118 consists of performancedrivenanalog placement and routing tools that penalize excesslayoutinduced performance degradation by adding theexcess degradation directly as an extra term to the costfunction. Effects considered include for instance the impactof device merging, device mismatches, parasitic capacitanceand resistance of each wire, parasitic coupling due tospecific proximities, thermal gradients, etc. The router canmanage not just parasitic wire sensititivies, but also yieldand testability concerns. A layout generated by means ofLAYLA was shown in Fig. 11.In all the above tools, sensitivity analysis is used toquantify the impact on final circuit performance of lowlevellayout decisions and has emerged as the critical glue thatlinks the various approaches being taken for circuitlevellayout and for system assembly. An influential early formulation of the sensitivity analysis problem was 119, whichnot only quantified layout impacts on circuit performance,but also showed how to use nonlinear programming techniques to map these sensitivities into maximum bounds onparasitics, which serve as constraints for various portions ofthe layout task. Later approaches 117, however, showedthat this intermediate mapping step may not be needed.Other work 120 showed how to extract critical constraintson symmetry and matching directly from a device schematic.A recent innovation in CMOS analog circuit layout generation tools is the idea of separating the device placementinto two distinct tasks device stacking followed by stackplacement. By rendering the circuit as an appropriate graphof connected drains and sources, it is possible to identifynatural clusters of MOS devices that ought to be merged,called stacks, to minimize parasitic capacitance, instead ofdiscovering these randomly over the different iterations ofthe placement optimization. The work in 121 presented anexact algorithm to extract all the optimal stacks, and dynamically choose the right stacking and the right placement ofeach stack throughout the placement optimization. Since theunderlying algorithm has exponential time complexity, enumerating all stacks can be very time consuming. The work in122 offered a variant that extracts one optimal set of stacksvery fast. The idea is to use this in the inner loop of a placerto evaluate fast trial merges on sets of nearby devices.One final problem in the macrocell placethenroute styleis the separation of the placement and routing steps. Theproblem is to estimate how much wiring space to leavearound each device for the subsequent routing. Too largeestimates result in open space, too small estimates may blockthe router and require changes to the placement. One solution is to get better estimates by carrying out simultaneousplacement and global routing, which has been implementedfor slicingstyle structures in 123. An alternative is touse dynamic wire space estimation where space is createdduring routing when needed. Another strategy is analogcompaction, where extra space is left during placement,which after routing is then removed by compaction. Analogcompactors that maintain the analog constraints introducedby the previous layout steps were for instance presented in115 and 124. A more radical alternative is to performsimultaneous device place and route. An experimental version of KOAN 125 supported this by iteratively perturbingboth the wires and the devices, but the method still has to beimproved for large practical circuits.Performancedriven macrocellstyle custom analog circuitlevel layout schemes are maturing nowadays, and thefirst commercial versions already started to be offered. Ofcourse, there are still problems to solve. The wire spaceproblem is one. Another open problem is closing the loopfrom circuit synthesis to circuit layout, so layouts that donot meet the specifications can, if necessary, cause actualcircuit design changes via circuit resynthesis. Even if aperformancedriven approach is used, which should generate layouts correct by construction, circuit synthesis needsaccurate estimates of circuit wiring loads to obtain goodsizing results, and circuit synthesis needs to leave sufficientperformance margins for the layoutinduced performancedegradation later on. How to control this loop, and how toreflect layout concerns in synthesis and synthesis concernsin layout remain difficult.2 MixedSignal System Layout Assembly Amixedsignal system is a set of analog and digital functionalblocks. Systemlevel layout assembly means floorplanning,placement, and global and detailed routing including thepower grid of the entire system, where the layouts of theindividual blocks are generated by lowerlevel tools such asdiscussed in the previous section for the analog circuits. In1844 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000Fig. 15. Principal flow of the WRIGHT mixedsignal floorplanner that incorporates a fast substratenoise coupling evaluator.addition to sensitivities to wire parasitics, an important newproblem in mixedsignal systems is the coupling betweendigital switching noise and sensitive analog circuits forinstance, capacitive crosstalk or substrate noise couplings.As at the circuit level, procedural layout generationremains a viable alternative for wellunderstood designswith substantial regularity e.g., switchedcapacitor filters126. More generally though, work has focused on customplacement and routing at the block level. For rowbasedlayout, an early elegant solution to the coupling problemwas the segregatedchannels idea of 127 to alternate noisydigital and sensitive analog wiring channels in a rowbasedcell layout. The strategy constrains digital and analog signalsnever to be in the same channel, and remains a practicalsolution when the size of the layout is not too large. Forlarge designs, analog channel routers were developed. In128, it was observed that a wellknown digital channelrouting algorithm, based on a gridless constraintgraphformulation, could easily be extended to handle criticalanalog problems that involve varying wire widths and wireseparations needed to isolate noisy and sensitive signals.The channel router ART extended this strategy to handlecomplex analog symmetries in the channel, and the insertionof shields between incompatible signals 129.The WREN 130 and WRIGHT 131 tools generalized these ideas to the case of arbitrary layouts of mixedfunctional blocks. WREN comprises both a mixedsignalglobal router and channel router 130. The tool introducedthe notion of signaltonoise ratio SNRstyle constraintsfor incompatible signals, and both the global and detailedrouters strive to comply with designerspecified noiserejection limits on critical signals. WREN incorporatesa constraint mapper that transforms input noise rejectionconstraints from the acrossthewholechip form used bythe global router into the perchannel persegment formnecessary for the channel router. WRIGHT on the otherhand uses simulated annealing to floorplan the blocks, butwith an integrated fast substratenoisecoupling evaluatorso that a simplified view of substrate noise influences thefloorplan 131. Fig. 15 shows the flow of this tool. Accuratemethods to analyze substrate couplings have been presentedin Section IIIA. In the frame of layout synthesis tools, however, the CPU times of these techniques are prohibitive andthere is a need for fast yet accurate substratenoisecouplingevaluators to explore alternative layout solutions.Another important task in mixedsignal system layoutis power grid design. Digital power grid layout schemesusually focus on connectivity, padtopin ohmic drop,and electromigration effects. But these are only a smallsubset of the problems in highperformance mixedsignalchips, which feature fastswitching digital systems nextto sensitive analog parts. The need to mitigate unwantedsubstrate interactions, the need to handle arbitrary nontreegrid topologies, and the need to design for transient effectssuch as current spikes are serious problems in mixedsignalpower grids. The RAIL system 132, 133 addresses theseconcerns by casting mixedsignal power grid synthesis as arouting problem that uses fast asymptoticwaveformevaluationbased 38 linear system evaluation to electricallymodel the entire power grid, package and substrate in theinner loop of grid optimization. Fig. 16 shows an exampleRAIL redesign of a data channel chip in which a demandingset of dc, ac, and transient performance constraints were metautomatically.Most of these mixedsignal systemlevel layout tools areof recent vintage, but because they often rely on mature corealgorithms from similar digital layout problems, many havebeen prototyped both successfully and quickly. Althoughthere is still much work to be done to enhance existingconstraint mapping strategies and constraintbased layouttools to handle the full range of industrial concerns, theprogress obtained opens possibilities for commercializationactivities in the near future to make these tools available toall practicing mixedsignal designers.E. Yield Estimation and OptimizationThe manufacturing of integrated circuits suffers fromstatistical fluctuations inherent to the fabrication processitself 101. These fluctuations can be local e.g., lithographic spots or global e.g., gate oxide gradients. TheseGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1845Fig. 16. RAIL power grid design for IBM data channel chip.processinduced deformations result in deviations of theactual performances of the fabricated ICs from the expectedperformances. Some of these deformations result in thefabricated IC not having the expected functionality. This isthen called a structural failure. Others cause the fabricatedIC to have, despite the correct functionality, observed performances far from the targeted values. This is then calleda hard performance failure. Both failures are also termedcatastrophic failures, caused by a catastrophic fault. Otherprocess deformations result in the observed performancesdeviating only slightly around the targeted values due to thestatistical tolerances interdie variations and mismatchesintradie variations of the device parameters. This is thencalled a parametric or soft performance failure, caused bya parametric fault.Both catastrophic and parametric faults cause a fractionof the fabricated ICs to have performances that do not meetthe required specifications. The ratio of accepted to the totalnumber of fabricated ICs is called the yield. If the yield is significantly less than 100, this implies a financial loss to theIC manufacturer. Therefore it is important to already calculate and maximize the manufacturing yield during the designstage. This is called design for manufacturability, whichimplies techniques for yield estimation and yield optimization. Even more expensive are the field failures that show upwhen the IC is in use in a product in the field, for instancewhen the IC is used under extreme operating conditions likehigh temperatures. To try to avoid this, the design has to bemade as robust as possible. This is called design for robustness or design for quality, which implies techniques forvariability minimization and design centering. Both aspectsare of course interrelated and can be captured in a characteristic like the capability index Cpk 102.Due to the fluctuations of the device parameters, the performance characteristics of the circuit will show fluctuations.The corresponding parametric yield is the integral over theacceptability region i.e., the region where all specificationsare satisfied of the joint probability density function of thefluctuating parameters. This yield can be calculated in boththe device parameter space or the circuit performance space.Its calculation, however, is complicated by the fact that in either space one of the two elements is not known explicitlythe statistical fluctuations are known in the device parameterspace but not in the circuit performance space, whereas theacceptability region is known in the performance space butnot in the parameter space 134. The relation between thedevice parameter space and the circuit performances dependson the nominal design point chosen for the circuit, but is ingeneral a nonlinear transformation that is not known explicitly. This relation can for instance be derived on a point bypoint basis using SPICE simulations. All this makes yield estimation a difficult task where the different techniques tradeoff accuracy versus CPU time in a different way.A simple approach often used in practice is worst caseanalysis 102. Instead of doing a true statistical analysis,some worst case combinations e.g., slow ptype devices, fastntype devices, etc. of the device parameters are used to calculate the worst case corners of the performances. Problems are that this approach can lead to large overestimationsand that for analog circuits it is usually not known a prioriwhich combinations of the device parameters result in theworst case corners. A deterministic technique based on sequential quadratic programming SQP to calculate the worstcase device model parameters and worst case operating conditions for each performance separately has been describedin 135. The corresponding worst case distances can be usedto measure the yield and the robustness of the design.The most straightforward statistical approach is to useMonteCarlo simulations, in which a large number ofsamples of the device parameters are generated accordingto the given statistics. The samples must include the correlations, but principal component analysis PCA techniquescan be used to generate uncorrelated parameter sets. Foreach generated sample set a SPICE simulation is performedand all resulting performance data are combined to derivethe statistics of the circuit performances. Since this processrequires many circuit simulations, especially when theconfidence factor on the yield or Cpk estimate has to besmall, this MonteCarlo approach is very timeconsuming.The CPU time can be reduced with the response surface method 136, which works in two steps. First, theparameter space is sampled with controlled simulationsaccording to some designofexperiments DOE scheme.For each performance characteristic a response surface isthen constructed by fitting a simple function e.g., a first or1846 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000secondorder polynomial of the device parameters to thesimulated performance data. By initial screening, unimportant device parameters can be eliminated from each model.Then, in the second step, the evaluation of these simpleresponse surface models replaces full circuit simulationsduring the yield or Cpk calculation, for instance using theMonteCarlo method. The only limitation of this approach isthe accuracy of the response surface models. Nevertheless,various forms of MonteCarlo simulationwith or withoutresponse surface acceleration techniqueremain staplesfor almost all analog design methodologies. A rigorousformulation to estimate the parametric yield of a circuitaffected by mismatches has been presented in 137. Theapproach, however, does not include yield due to defects.Finally, if the calculated yield or Cpk is not sufficient,then the design will have to be altered in order to increasethe yield or the design robustness 102, 134. By changingthe nominal design point, either the probability density function in the performance space, or the acceptability region inthe device parameter space will be modified, and hence theyieldCpk. The goal is then to modify the nominal designpoint such that the yield is maximized, or the variability ofthe circuit performance is minimized, or the design is centered. The most direct approach is to put one of the aboveyieldCpk estimation routines in an optimization loop and directly try to maximize the yieldCpk. Needless to say, this isextremely time consuming. Here again, the response surfacetechnique can be used to reduce the number of required simulations, by using the technique in two subsequent phases andgenerating an explicit response surface model for the yield orCpk as a function of the nominal design point parameters. Analternative is the technique of design centering where the design is centered as much as possible within the acceptabilityregion. Geometric approximation techniques such as simplicial approximation, etc., have to be used to approximate theacceptability region in the device parameter space, but thesetechniques suffer from a bad computational complexity. Theapproach in 93 uses the worst case distances as robustnessobjectives during design centering, and applies the generalized boundary curve technique to reduce the number of simulations required. The challenge is also to incorporate yieldand robustness optimization as an integrated part of circuitsynthesis, instead of considering it as an separate step to beperformed after a first nominalonly circuit sizing. First attempts in this direction have already been presented in Section IIIC 103, 104, but the execution times still have tobe reduced further.F. Analog and MixedSignal Testing and Design forTestabilityThe final step in the IC production cycle is the testingof the IC 138, 139. The objective of testing is to verifywhether the fabricated IC meets the specifications it was designed for or not. The cost of testing is a considerable part ofthe final cost of an IC, and the later in the production cyclea certain defect is detected, the more expensive the financial loss. The effective cost of a product is therefore relatedto the quality of the applied tests and the time necessary togenerate and apply the tests. In mixedsignal designs, an additional complication is that, although analog circuits constitute only a small fraction of the die area, they are responsiblefor the largest fraction of the overall test cost. This is notonly because they require more expensive mixed signal testequipment, but also because they require longer test timesthan the digital circuitry and because there are no structuredtest waveform generation tools nor structured design for testmethodologies.The testing of an IC is complicated by the limited pincount, which means that only a limited number of nodes canbe accessed from the outside. In order to increase the controllability and observability of internal nodes, design for testability DfT measures have to be included in the design andlayout of the IC. A second problem critical in analog designsis the presence of statistical process parameter fluctuations,which make multiple fabricated samples of the same circuitshowing a statistical spread of responses around the nominal response called a tolerance box. Due to this spreading,the tolerance boxes of the faultfree and certain faulty circuits may overlap for the given test set, creating so calledambiguity regions where the given test cannot uniquely distinguish between faultfree and faulty devices. The test maytherefore result in some percentage of undecisive or wrongtest decisions, which of course has to be reduced as much aspossible. Fortunately, the situation is changing and the fieldof analog and mixedsignal testing is characterized by manyinteresting developments, which will only be touched uponhere briefly. The reader is referred to 138140 for moredetails.For fault detection in gonogo production testing, testcost and test time are critical. Two basic approaches canbe distinguished. The traditional test approach is specification based, also called functional testing. Tests are appliedto check the functionality of the circuit under test againstthe specifications. For instance, for an analogtodigital converter, these are the traditional tests such as the histogram testto derive the integral and differential nonlinearity INL andDNL and the effective number of bits ENOB. The problems with this approach are that there is no quantification ofhow necessary and how sufficient these tests are for detectingwhether a circuit is faultfree or not, and that this test generation process is difficult to automate. A more recent approach,therefore, is defectbased analog testing, mimicking the approach in use for a long time in digital testing. In this case,tests are applied to detect whether specific faults are presentin the fabricated circuit structure or not. This requires thatthe faults that are being tested for are collected in advance ina socalled fault dictionary, which implies the use of a certain fault model and of fault simulation. Unlike in the digitalworld, however, there is no common agreement in the analogdesign and test community on the fault models to be used. Forinstance, a spot defect shorting two neighboring wires can berepresented as an ideal short of the two corresponding nodes,or as a resistor between the two nodes with a value of 0.1 ,or a resistor with a value of 1 , etc. All this makes it hardto calculate a fault coverage characteristic to qualify testGIELEN AND RUTENBAR COMPUTERAIDED DESIGN OF ANALOG AND MIXEDSIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS 1847sets. In addition, not all possible faults can occur in practice.For instance, assuming all possible shorts between any twonodes in the circuit and all possible opens for all interconnections in the circuit may lead to unrealistically large faultlists. A more efficient technique is inductive fault analysis140 that generates a list of physically realistic faults to betested for by sprinkling defects across the actual layout andextracting possible faults from this. In any case, whatever thefault list, each faulty circuit considered has to be simulatedduring the design stage to build up the fault dictionary, whichis extremely time consuming. Therefore, techniques to speedup fault simulations have received large attention in recentyears 141.During fault diagnosis in the initial IC prototype characterization and validation phase the test problem is even morecomplicated not only must it be detected whether there is afault or not in the circuit, but also the location of the fault hasto be identified to diagnose the error. This is more difficult asthere may also be ambiguity regions between the responsesof circuits with different faults, making it impossible to distinguish between the ambiguous cases for the given test set.Two basic approaches are possible 138. In simulation before test SBT, the faultfree and faulty circuits are simulated beforehand and the responses are stored in a fault dictionary. During testing the measured response is then compared to the signatures in the fault dictionary to identify themost likely case. The second approach is simulation aftertest SAT, where the circuit is measured first and then thecircuit parameters are reconstructed from the measurementresults and compared to the faultfree values. It is not alwayspossible, however, to uniquely solve the value of each element out of a given measurement set, making it necessary touse optimization techniques to estimate the most likely element values from the measurements.Concerning the tests themselves, both dc, ac frequency,or transient tests can be carried out, and the measured signalscan be node voltages, pin currents e.g., the powersupplycurrentthe equivalent of digital IDDQ testing or derivedcharacteristics. The goal of test waveform generation is todetermine which tests have to be carried out which stimulito be applied, which signals to be measured in order to havemaximum fault coverage at a minimum test cost. In general, this has to be formulated as an optimization problemand some interesting approaches have been presented in recent years 142, 143. In order to overcome the problem ofthe limited accessibility in ICs, design for testability measures have to be taken to improve the controllability and observability by propagating test signals from the external ICpins to and from internal, otherwise inaccessible nodes 140.These measures can for instance take the form of extra testpins or extra test structures e.g., demultiplexers to isolateand individually test the different analog blocks in the system144, analog scan path techniques to read out selected testnode signals into a serial scan path 145, or extra circuitry toreconfigure the circuit in the test mode, e.g., use a feedbackstructure to reconfigure the circuit into an oscillator modewhere the oscillation frequency then indicates whether thecircuit is faulty or faultfree 146.With the move toward systems on a chip where theanalog circuitry is deeply embedded into the system, thelimited accessibility problem will become more and morestringent. An appealing alternative for such systems is theuse of builtin self test BIST. In this case, the generationof the test waveforms, the capturing of the test responses,and their comparison to the expected good responses are allperformed onchip, resulting in the circuit autonomouslyreturning a pass or fail signal, at the expense of some chiparea overhead. The response comparison has to considertolerances both on the stored good signature and on themeasured signals in order to avoid false rejections andescapes. Although most mixedsignal BIST schemes todayhave a restricted applicability, some noteworthy approacheshave already been presented, most of them exploiting thepresence of onchip data converters and surrounding digitalcircuitry. In the MADBIST scheme, after selftesting thedigital circuitry, the DA converter is configured in oscillator mode to test the AD converter, after which the DAconverter and then the other analog circuitry is tested 147.In the HBIST scheme for socalled discretized analogapplications i.e., applications consisting of the sequenceanalog inADCDSPDACanalog out, the analog outputin test mode is fed back to the analog input, to create a loopthat starts and ends at the central DSP part 148. Afterfirst selftesting the DSP part, the analog loop can then betested while test signals are provided and processed by theDSP part. With the move toward systems on a chip andthe paradigm of building systems by mixing and matchingIP blocks, the role of analog BIST schemes will becomemore and more important in the future, and more researchin this direction is to be expected. Also, the IEEE P1149.4standardized mixedsignal test bus may create opportunitieshere 149.IV. CONCLUSIONThe increasing levels of integration in the microelectronicsindustry, now approaching the era of systems on a chip, hasalso brought about the need for systematic design methodologies and supporting CAD tools that increase the productivityand improve the quality in the design of analog and mixedsignal integrated circuits and systems. This survey paper haspresented an overview of the current context and state ofthe art in the field of analog and mixedsignal CAD tools.After introducing the industrial context and the design flow,an overview has been given of the progress in analog andmixedsignal simulation and modeling, symbolic analysis,analog circuit synthesis and optimization, analog and mixedsignal layout generation, yield analysis and design centering,as well as analog and mixedsignal test.Most progress has been obtained in the field of analog,mixed analogdigital and multilevel analog simulation,where many commercial solutions are available. Also, thestandardization of analog and mixedsignal hardware description languages is approaching completion. In the fieldof custom analog circuit and layout synthesis, substantialprogress at the research level has been achieved over the1848 PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE, VOL. 88, NO. 12, DECEMBER 2000past decade, despite the dearth of commercial offerings yet.Cast mostly in the form of numerical and combinatorialoptimization tasks, linked by various forms of sensitivityanalysis and constraint mapping, leveraged by ever fasterworkstations, some of these tools show glimmers of practical application, and commercial startups have embarked tobring these to industrial practice. Also, in the field of analogand mixedsignal test new ideas have been developed, butthey are striving for industrial acceptance now.One conclusion is clear In order to meet the economicconstraints time to market, cost, quality of future semiconductor products, analog design will have to be carried outin a much more systematic and structured way, supportedby methodologies and tools that fit in the overall systemdesign flow. Although research in academia has not fullysolved all the relevant problems yet, this paper has shown thatreal progress has been made over the last decade. Therefore,given the current market pressures and given the existence ofcore design technology in academia, we can hope that commercial offerings will soon follow and that analog designerswill finally get the boost in productivity needed to take themfrom the dark ages of analog black magic to the bright future of integrated systems on a chip.
