Abstract— In this paper Large Area Synchronized LAS
CDMA is investigated, which exhibits a significantly better
performance than the traditional random code based DSCDMA
system. Closed-form formulas are derived for characterizing the
BER performance of LAS-CDMA as a function of the number
of resolvable paths Lp, the maximum delay difference τmax and
the number of users K when communicating over a Nakagami
m fading channel. Moreover, the limited number of available
LAS codes having a certain interference free window width
suggests that the employment of LAS-CDMA is beneficial in
a low-user-load scenario, where a near-single-user performance
can be achieved without a multiuser detector. In this paper

I. INTRODUCTION
IN Direct Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA) systems, the spreading sequences characterize the
associated Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) as well as the
Multiple Access Interference (MAI) properties [1]. Tradi
tional spreading sequences, such as m-sequences [1], Gold
codes [1] and Kasami codes [1] exhibit non-zero offpeak
auto-correlations and cross-correlations, which results in a
high MAI in case of asynchronous uplink transmissions
Another family of orthogonal codes is constituted by Walsh
codes [1] and orthogonal Gold codes, which retain their
orthogonality only in case of perfect synchronization, but they
also exhibit non-zero off-peak auto-correlations and cross
correlations in asynchronous scenarios. Consequently, these
correlation properties limit the achievable performance in
asynchronous scenarios. Hence traditional DS-CDMA cellular

systems are interference limited and suffer from the socalled
’near-far’ effects, unless complex interference cancellers
or multi-user detectors [1] are employed for combating these
adverse effects. This results in costly and powerhungry
implementations. All these limitations are imposed by the
imperfect correlation properties of the spreading sequences
employed
Hence, considerable research efforts have been invested in
designing spreading sequences, which exhibit zero correlation
values, when the relative delay-induced code offset is in the
so-called Zero Correlation Zone (ZCZ) or Interference Free
Window (IFW) of the spreading code [2]. The attractive
family of Large Area Synchronized (LAS) CDMA spreading
sequences is constituted by the combination of the socalled
Large Area (LA) codes [3], [4] and Loosely Synchronous LS
codes [5]. The resultant LAS codes exhibit an IFW, where
the off-peak aperiodic autocorrelation values as well as the
aperiodic cross-correlation values become zero, resulting in
zero ISI and zero MAI, provided that the time-offset of the
codes is within the IFW. In order to ensure that the relative
time-offsets between the codes are within the IFW, the mobiles
are expected to operate in a quasi-synchronous manner. More
specifically, interference-free CDMA communications become
possible, when the total time-offset expressed in terms of the
number of chip intervals, which is the sum of the time-offset of
the mobiles plus the maximum channel-induced delay spread
is within the designed IFW. In case of high transmissiondelay
differences accurate timing-advance control has to be used
as it was also advocated in the GSM system [7]. Provided
that these conditions are satisfied, a major benefit of the LAS
codes is that they are capable of achieving a nearsingleuser
performance without multi-user detectors
The disadvantage of LAS codes is that the number of codes
having an IFW is limited. For example, we will show that
when we consider a spreading factor of 151, we only have
32 LAS codes exhibiting an IFW of width 3Tc, where Tc
is the chip duration. Furthermore, the auto-correlation and
cross-correlation function of LAS codes typically exhibits a
higher value outside the IFW than that of traditional random
codes. More explicitly, when the LAS-CDMA system operates
in an asynchronous manner, such as for example the third
generation W-CDMA system [1], [8], it will encounter more
serious MAI and Multipath Interference (MPI) than traditional
DSCDMA
Against this backdrop, the novel contribution of this paper
is that we analytically investigate the performance of LAS
CDMA in a quasi-synchronous uplink scenario when com
municating over a Nakagami-m channel and characterize its
BER performance as a function of the number of resolvable
paths Lp, the maximum delay difference τmax, the number of

This paper is organized as follows. Section II will introduce
the family of LAS codes, while Section III will describe the
LAS-CDMA system model. In Section IV we will characterize
the BER performance of LAS-CDMA, and in Section V we
will discuss our findings. Finally, in Section VI we will offer
our conclusion
II. GENERATION OF LASCODES
A. LA Codes
LA codes [3], [4] belong to a family of ternary codes having
elements of ±1 or 0. Their maximum correlation magnitude is
unity and they also exhibit an IFW. Let us denote the family
of the Kc number of orthogonal ternary codes employing Kc
number of binary ±1 pulses by LA(LA,M,Kc), which exhibit
a minimum spacing of M chip durations between nonzero
pulses, while having a total code length of LA chips, as shown
in Figure 1. All the codes corresponding to an LA code family
share the same legitimate pulse positions. However, a specific
drawback of this family of sequences is their relatively low
duty ratio, quantifying the density of the non-zero pulses, since
this limits the number of codes available and hence the number
of users supported. Li [3] characterized the pulse positions
of the LA code family, while Choi and Hanzo [9] further
improved the achievable duty ratio of the LA codes. In the
LAS-CDMA 2000 system [10], the LA codes used constitute
a modified version of the LA(LA,M,Kc)=LA(2552, 136,
code, where the Kc = 17 non-zero pulse positions, pk, k
0, · · · , 16, are given by
{pk} = {0, 136, 274, 414, 556, 700, 846, 994,
1296, 1450, 1606, 1764, 1924, 2086,
2416,
For a specific procedure concerning the design of LAcode
based LAS codes, please refer to [9], where the associated
correlation properties and the IFW width of the codes were
also characterized
B. Loosely Synchronized Codes
Apart from the LA codes of Section II-A, there exists
another specific family of spreading codes, which also exhibits
an IFW. Specifically, Loosely Synchronized (LS) codes
exploit the properties of the so-called orthogonal comple
mentary sets [5], [11]. To expound further, let us introduce
the notation of LS(N,P,W0) for denoting the family of LS

(b) Generating four LS codes
Fig. 2. Generating the LS(N, P,W0) code using the (P × P ) = (4 ×
Walsh-Hadamard matrix components (1, 1, 1, 1) and (1,−1,
codes generated by applying a (P × P )-dimensional Walsh
Hadamard (WH) matrix to an orthogonal complementary code
set of length N , as it is exemplified in the context of Figure
More specifically, we generate a complementary code pair
inserting W0 number of zeros both in the center and at the
beginning of the complementary pair, as shown in Figure a
using the procedure described in [5]. As mentioned above, the
polarity of the codes c0 and s0 seen in Figure ?? during the
constitution of the LS codes is determined by the polarity
of the components of a Walsh-Hadamard matrix, namely by
(1, 1, 1, 1) and (1,−1, 1,−1). Then, the total length of the
LS(N,P,W0) code is given by LS = NP +2W0 and later
we will demonstrate that the total number of codes available
is given by 4P . The number of these codes having an IFW
of W0 chips is P , which limits the number of users that can
be supported without imposing multiuser interference. Hence
the number of codes having as long an IFW as possible has
to be maximized for a given code length LS = NPW
Since the construction method of binary LS codes was
described in [5], here we refrain from providing an indepth
discourse and we will focus our attention on the employment
of orthogonal complementary sets [12], [13] for the generation
of LS codes
For a given complementary code pair {c0, s0} of length N
one of the corresponding so-called mate pairs can be written
as {c1, s1}, where we have
c1 = s̃∗0,
s1 = −c̃∗0,
and where s̃0 denotes the reverse-ordered sequence and s
is the negated version of s0, respectively. Note that in Equa
tion 1 and Equation 2 additional complex conjugation of the
polyphase complementary sequences {c0, s0} is required for
deriving the corresponding mate pair {c1, s1} in comparison
to binary complementary sequences [5]. Having obtained a
complementary pair and its corresponding mate pair, we may
employ the construction method of [5] for generating a whole
family of LS codes. The LS codes generated exhibit an IFW of
length W0. Hence, we may adopt the choice of W0=N−1 in
order to minimize the total length of the LS codes generated
while providing as long an IFW as possible
For example, the LS(N,P,W0)=LS(4,4,3) codes can be

codes exhibit the same autocorrelation magnitude; (b) the crosscorrelation

generated based on the complementary pair of
c0 = +++−
s0 = ++−+ .
Upon substituting Equation 1 and Equation 2 into Equation
and Equation 4, the corresponding mate pair can be obtained
as
c1 = s̃∗0 = +−++
s1 = −c̃∗0 = +−−− .
The first set of four LS codes can be generated using the
first two rows of a (P × P ) = (4 × 4)-dimensional Walsh
Hadamard matrix, namely using w0 =(+1,+1,+1,+1) and
w1 = (+1,−1,+1,−1), as shown in Figure 2(b). Another
set of four LS codes can be obtained by exchanging the
subscripts 0 and 1. Finally, eight additional LS codes can
be generated by applying the same principle, but with the
aid of the last two rows of the (4 × 4)-dimensional Walsh
Hadamard matrix, namely using w2 =(+1,+1,−1,−1) and
w3=(+1,−1,−1,+1). Hence, the total number of available
codes in the family of LS(N , P , W0) codes is given by
4P . More explicitly, there are four sets of P number of LS
codes. Each set has four LS codes, and the LS codes in the
same set exhibit an IFW length of [−ι,+ι], where we have
ι=min{W0, N−1}. The aperiodic auto-correlation and cross
correlation function ρp(τ), ρjk(τ) of the codes belonging to
the same set will be zero for |τ | ≤ W0 = 3, as seen in
Figure 3. Furthermore, the LS codes belonging to the four
different sets are still orthogonal to each other at zero offset
namely in a perfectly synchronous environment. However, the
LS codes belonging to the four different sets will lose their
orthogonality, when they have a non-zero codeoffset
In this section we have demonstrated that the family of
LS(N,P,W0) codes can be constructed for almost any arbi
trary code-length related parameter N by employing binary
sequences. Having discussed the construction of LA and LS
codes, let us now consider how LS codes are implanted at
the non-zero pulse-positions of the LA codes for the sake of
generating LAS codes
C. Seeding LS Codes in LA Codes to Generate LAS codes
We observed in Section II-A that the main problems asso
ciated with applying LA codes in practical CDMA systems
are related to their low duty ratio and to the resultant small
number of available codes. A specific family of LAS codes
mitigates this problem by combining the LA codes of Sec
tion II-A and the LS codes of Section II-B. More specifically
LS codes are inserted between the non-zero pulses of the
LA code sequence of Figure 1, in an effort to generate an
increased number of spreading codes having an increased duty
ratio, while maintaining attractive correlation properties. For
example, in the LAS-2000 system [10] , the LS spreading
codes are inserted into the LA code’s zero space, as shown in
Figure
Let us denote the combined code generated
from the LA(LA,M,K) and LS(N,P,W0) codes as
LAS(LA,M,Kc;N,P,W0), which is generated by employing
the so-called absolute encoding method [3], [9]. For the
sake of preserving the original IFW size of the constituent
LS(N,P,W0) code when combined with an LALAMK
code employing the absolute encoding scheme, the length of
the LS code - including W0 number of trailing zeros - should
not exceed the minimum pulse spacing M of the LA code
requiring that we have
PN + 2W0 ≤ M.
In the LAS-CDMA 2000 system [10], a modified version of
the LA(2552,136,17) and LS(4,32,4) codes was combined for
the sake of generating the LAS(LA = 2552, LS = M
136,Kc = 17;N = 4, P = 32,W0 = 4) code. As we
mentioned in Section II-B, from the total set of 4P =
LS codes, only 32 LS codes exhibited an IFW width of ι =
Different permutations of the LA codes were employed in
the different cells for the sake of mitigating the intercell
interferences imposed

mutation of the code-allocation mitigates the inter-cell interference, because
using the same codes in different cells would result in an increased intercell
interference due to their high crosscorrelation

at a given base station can be expressed as

where bk is the transmitted bit of k user, while N(t) is the
complex-valued low-pass-equivalent AWGN having a double
sided spectral density of N0, τk is the propagation delay of
user k, while τk is assumed to be a random variable uniformly
distributed in the range of [0, τmax], and Lp is the total number
of resolvable paths
IV. BER ANALYSIS
A. Random Spreading Code Based CDMA
Let the kth user be the user-of-interest and consider a
receiver using de-spreading as well as multipath diversity
combining. The conventional matched filter based RAKE
receiver using MRC can be invoked for detection, where we
assume that the RAKE receiver combines a total of Lr number
of diversity paths, which may be more or possibly less than
the actual number of resolvable components available at the
current chip-rate. The value of Lr is typically restricted by
the affordable receiver complexity
Let us assume that we have achieved perfect time synchro
nization and that perfect estimates of the channel tap weights
as well as phases are available. Then, after appropriately
delaying the individual matched filter outputs, in order to
coherently combine the L number of path signals with the aid
of the RAKE combiner, the output Zkl of the RAKE receivers
lth finger sampled at t = T + lTc + τk, can be expressed as
Zkl = Dkl + Ikl,
where Dkl represents the desired direct component, which can
be expressed as
Dkl

2PTsbk[0]h2kl.
In Equation 12 bk[0] is the first bit transmitted by the kth user
where we have bk[0] ∈ {+1,−1}. Hence, the interference plus
noise term Ikl in Equation 11 can be expressed as
Ikl = Ikl[S] + Ikl[M ] +Nk,
where Ikl[S] represents the multipath interference imposed by
the user-of-interest, which can be expressed as

Having obtained the decision variables of the MRC’s output
samples, let us now analyze the BER performance of the
proposed LAS-CDMA system and benchmark it against a
random code based CDMA system using hard-detection by
invoking the often-used classic Gaussian approximation. We
employ the standard Gaussian approximation and hence model
both the multiuser interference and the self-interference terms
of Equation 13 as an AWGN process having a zero mean and
a variance equal to the corresponding variances. Consequently
for a given set of channel amplitudes {hkl} – according to the
analysis of the previous sections – for the random spreading
codes and BPSK modulation considered, the RAKE fingers
output signal Zkl is a Gaussian distributed random variable
having a mean of Dkl
Let us first consider the random code based DSCDMA
system. The variance of the lth RAKE finger’s output samples

approximated as [18],

Therefore, for a random code based DS-CDMA system we
may argue that all paths of the interfering users will impose
MAI on the reference user, and all multipath components
of the reference user will additionally inflict MPI upon the
reference user’s desired signal
B. LAS Spreading Code Based CDMA
Let us now consider the interference suppression achieved
with the aid of the IFW of LAS codes. In this scenario
only the paths arriving from the interfering users outside the
IFW will inflict MAI upon the reference user, and this users
own delayed paths arriving outside the IFW will additionally
impose MPI. Observe in Figure 5, for example that both
the kth user and the (k + 1)st user encounter five multipath
components. When we considered the kth user’s first RAKE
receiver finger and an IFW of ι = 2, only those two paths of
the kth user will impose MPI, which fall outside the codes
IFW. Similarly, the (k+1)st user imposed only one interfering
path on the kth user’s first RAKE finger’s decision variable
since four of the five path fall within the IFW. Hence, we will
investigate the interference suppression capability of the IFW
as shown in a stylized fashion in Figure
As argued above, in the context of LAS-CDMA, not all
the (Lp − 1) paths will impose MPI. Specifically, for the lth
finger’s output sample Zkl of the RAKE receiver only the rays
arriving outside the IFW will impose MPI, where we have
|lp − l| > ι.
Hence, for the lth finger of the RAKE receiver, the corre

Similarly, for the multiuser interference term Ikl[M ] of Equa

|(lp − l)Tc + (τk′ − τk)| > ιTc,
will impose MAI. Let us now define ξ = Int{(lp − l)
(τk′ − τk)/Tc}, where Int{x} denotes the integer part of the
arbitrary value x, while x−Int{x} represents the noninteger

ρ̂k′k(τc) = ρk′k(ξ)R̂ψ(τc) + ρk′k(ξ + 1)Rψ(τc),
= + + 1)Rψ(τc),
and we assume that τk and τk′ are random variables uniformly
distributed in [0, τmax]. Therefore, the average variance of the

V. PERFORMANCE OF LAS DSCDMA
In our investigations we compared a traditional and a LAS
code based CDMA system, both of which have the same chip
rate and bandwidth. However, both their effective spreading
gain as well as their correlation functions are different. There
fore these two systems are affected differently by the MAI
and MPI and hence their expected performance will differ
In the LAS-CDMA 2000 system, the LA(2552,136,17) and
LS(4,32,4) codes are combined, as seen in Figure 4. More
explicitly, the total length of the LS(N,P,W0) LS
code is Ls = NP + 2W0 = 136 chips, which is in
corporated into the LA(LA,M,K)=LA(2552,136,17) code
again, as seen in Figure 4, for the sake of creating the
LAS(LA,M,Kc;N,P,W0) = LAS(2552,136,17;4,32,4) code
Since this LAS code has certain zero-valued gaps after insert
ing the LS code into the LA code as portrayed in Figure
as well as the 2W0 number of zeros constituting the IFW
its spreading factor may be calculated by simply noting that
each bit to be transmitted is spread by one of the constituent
LS(4,32,4) codes. Although the length of this LS code is
LS = NP + 2W0 = 136, the effective spreading gain of
the LAS code is identical to that of its constituent LS codes
namely GLAS = GLS = 128. By contrast, a traditional random
code based CDMA system having the same LA = 2552 chips
would have a higher spreading gain, since it does not have any
zero-valued gaps, nor has an IFW. Hence the corresponding
spreading gain becomes GRandom = 2552/17 = 151, since
in Figure 4 K = 17 bits are mapped to LA = 2552 chips
This spreading gain difference was taken into account in
our results, again, assuming that the LAS-code and random
code based systems considered have the same bandwidth. We
will compare these two system’s performance based on these
two different effective spreading gains. For simplicity’s sake
we assume that all paths have the same Nakagami fading
parameter, i.e. we have ml = m, l = 0, . . . , Lr −

Fig. 7. BER versus channel SNR performance comparison of random
code based classic CDMA and LAS CDMA based on Equation 53, when
communicating over different Nakagami fading channels. K = 32 users were
supported and the negative exponential MIP decay factor was η = 0.2. The
IFW width was ι = 3, and the maximum delay difference was τmax = Tc
The number of resolvable paths was Lp = 4 and the RAKE receiver
combined Lr = 3 paths
In Figure 6, we assumed that the LAS-CDMA system oper
ated in a quasi-synchronous scenario, which can be achieved
for example with the aid of a Global Positioning System GPS
assisted synchronization protocol. We assume that we have a
maximum propagation delay of τmax = 2Tc. The channels
delay spread is negative exponentially distributed in the range
of [0.3, 3]μs [22], and we assume that both the random and
LAS-code based systems have a chip rate of Mchips
The number of resolvable paths is Lp = τchTc 	+1 = 4, where
τch = 3μs. Both the random code based CDMA system and
the LAS-CDMA system supported K = 32 users, and the
width of the IFW was 3Tc for the LAS-CDMA system, ie
we had ι = 3. From Figure 6, we can observe that the LAS
CDMA system has a significantly better BER performance
than the traditional DS-CDMA system, when communicating
over a quasi-synchronous channel, provided that both these
two systems combine the same Lr = 1, 2, 3 ≤ Lp number of
resolvable paths, respectively. The reason that the LASCDMA
scheme outperforms the traditional DS-CDMA system is that
the MAI and MPI is reduced, as a benefit of using LAS codes
Figure 7 exhibits the performance of these two systems
communicating over different fading channels associated with
different Nakagami fading parameters. More explicitly, when
we have m = 1, we model a Rayleigh fading channel, m =
represents a Rician fading channel, while m → ∞ corre
sponds to an AWGN channel. We can observe from Figure
that the LAS-CDMA system exhibited a significantly better
BER performance than the traditional DS-CDMA system
regardless of the value of m. More specifically, provided
that all these uplink users are in a quasi-synchronous state
i.e we have τmax = 2Tc and Lp = 4, the LASCDMA
scheme outperformed the traditional DS-CDMA system, when
communicating over different Nakagami multipath fading
channels

η = 0.2. The IFW width was ι = 3 and the maximum delay difference was
τmax = 2Tc. The RAKE receiver combined Lr = 3 paths
Figure 8 shows the performance of these two systems for
transmission over different dispersive channels having Lp
4 . . . 12 resolvable multipath components and assuming that
Lr = 3 of these components were combined by the RAKE
receiver. We can observe from Figure 8 that when the channel
became more dispersive, the LAS-CDMA system’s perfor
mance was significantly degraded and its gain over the tradi
tional DS-CDMA system was eroded. Nonetheless, the LAS
CDMA scheme still outperformed the traditional DSCDMA
system, provided that the users were in a quasisynchronous
state, i.e when we had τmax = 2Tc. However, when Lp
was increased to 12, the LAS-CDMA system retained only
a moderate gain over the traditional DS-CDMA arrangement
even if it operated in a quasi-synchronous scenario. The reason
for this performance erosion is that many of the paths will
be located outside the IFW when Lp is high and the auto
correlation as well as cross-correlation of LS codes outside the
IFW is higher than that of the random codes. Hence, when Lp
is high, LAS-CDMA inevitably encounters serious MAI and
MPI. However, for a high-chip-rate system we may consider
the employment of MC DS-CDMA [1], which is capable
of ensuring that each subcarrier encounters only Lp =
resolvable paths. In this scenario, LAS MC DS-CDMA may
be expected to retain its ability to effectively suppress both
the MAI and MPI
In Figure 9 we can observe that as the maximum propa
gation delay τmax increases, the performance of LASCDMA
significantly degrade. When we have τmax ≥ 10Tc, the LAS
CDMA system’s performance becomes even worse than that of
traditional DS-CDMA. This is because the insertion of zeros
in the LAS codes reduces the effective spreading gain of the
LAS-CDMA system and when the propagation delay max
increases, its MAI suppression capability will be inevitably
reduced. Hence we may conclude that LAS-CDMA systems

are suitable for operating in a quasi-synchronous CDMA
environment
Stańczak et al. [5] concluded that the width ι of the IFW
and the number of users K will obey K(ι + 1) ≤ G. In the
LAS-CDMA 2000 system [10], when the number of users
K exceeds 32, or more explicitly, when all the four different
sets of LS codes mentioned in Section II-B are employed
the width of the IFW will be reduced to zero for the codes
belonging to different sets associated with different rows of
the corresponding WH matrix. For example, when we have
K = 128, all the 128 users’ signals are orthogonal to each
other in case of perfect synchronization. However, the width
of the IFW of LS codes belonging different LAS code sets
generated using different rows of the WH matrix becomes
zero. In this scenario, serious MAI and MPI will be incurred
when the inter-set orthogonality of the LAS-codes generated
with the aid of different rows of the WH matrix is destroyed
by the multipath channel. Therefore, the performance of LAS
CDMA will significantly degrades, when the number of users
supported becomes K > 32. In Figure 10, we can observe that
for K ≥ 60 the LAS-CDMA system will have no advantage in
comparison to the traditional DS-CDMA scheme, or even may
perform worse than the traditional DS-CDMA arrangement
although all users operate in a quasi-synchronous manner
Hence, we may conclude that the employment of LASCDMA
is beneficial in low-user-load scenarios, where the delay spread
is also limited
In order to circumvent the performance limitation of the
proposed system, we finally introduce the concept of mul
ticarrier LAS DS-CDMA, which allow to extend the IFW
duration by a factor of the number subcarriers. Figure
demonstrated the achievable performance of Singlecarrier
LAS DS-CDMA and MC LAS CDMA for a singlecarrier
3.84Mchips/s system. From this figure we may conclude that

Lr = 3 paths
the MC LAS DS-CDMA is capable of achieving the best
performance trade-off by selecting the optimum number of
subcarriers U according to the channel’s delay dispersion ch
and the delay difference τmax. For example, we may conclude
from Figure 11 that the U = 8 MC LAS DS-CDMA system
exhibited the best trade-off in a scenario of τch = 3μs and
τmax = s
VI. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, LAS-CDMA was investigated, which ex
hibited a significantly better performance than the traditional
random code based DS-CDMA system in a relatively low
chip-rate scenario, provided that all users operate in a quasi
synchronous manner. As the chip-rate increases, the num
ber of resolvable paths also increases, which will impose a
performance degradation. Hence, as suggested in Figure
LAS-CDMA may be expected to have a moderate perfor
mance gain over the traditional DS-CDMA system, when Lp
is in excess of 12, but as the maximum delay difference
τmax increases, the performance of LAS-CDMA degrades
significantly. Furthermore, the limited number of available
LAS codes having a certain IFW width suggests that the
employment of LAS-CDMA is beneficial in a lowuserload
scenario. Our further research will investigate the performance
of multi-carrier LASCDMA
