ABSTRACT
In this paper, the performance characteristic of the proposed VP-Based ATM Ring network exclusive voice and
data traffic is presented.  A case study of a  proposed method namely control mechanism method in order to
achieve efficient and fairness among voice and data traffics in the ATM ring network. The main goal of the
study is to estimate the effect of the load on the Mean Waiting Time (MWT) and Maximum Buffer Size (MBS).
Then, find out the maximum load capacity that can be carried by the proposed network. The proposed control
mechanism method fairly serviced both traffics on the network. The simulation and analytical results indicate
that as the Offered Load (OL) increases, the MWT and Buffer Size (Bsiz) are also increase up to saturation limit.
Beyond the saturation limit, MWT and Bsiz rapidly increase due to the large number of cells and queuing delay.

I. INTRODUCTION
Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) was developed originally as the basic transfer technology for
future public networks such as Broadband-ISDN. In spite of this, it is also suitable for very high
speed communication systems in general. The motivation for using ATM in a LAN is based on the
very high available bandwidth with scalability, independent of the underlying transmission systems.
This allows various LAN applications with different demands on bandwidth to be carried out
efficiently [1]. The recent emergence of ATM technology makes available a unique driving
technology for high-speed communication platforms, with line speeds that will scale to interfaces in
the gigabit range [2].
It is not yet clear what types of services and applications will come to dominate in the future
multimedia communications environment. Therefore the architecture for ATM network, serving as
the infrastructure for future multimedia service should be adaptable to charge in different
communication bit rates service categories communication modes, etc [3,4]. Cell sequence on a
virtual channel is preserved, a very low cell loss probability must be guaranteed (< 10-2), and
intensive error and flow control protocols are specified with nominal rates of 155.52 Mbps and
622.08 Mbps [5,6].  Much architecture have been proposed [7], all approaches point to the need of a
very high-speed hardware switch because of the involved high transfer rates. On the other hand, due
to the statistical multiplexing, buffering is also required in order to avoid packet loss whenever there
are multiple input packets arriving simultaneously on different input ports and destined for the same
output. Only one packet at a time can be transmitted over an output link, the rest must be temporarily
stored in a buffer for late transmission. A proposed method namely: “Control mechanism” to provide
fairness among voice and data traffics, it confirms its effectiveness for fairness of traffic on the ATM
Ring network. Our main goal of the study is to estimate the effect of the load on the Mean Waiting
Time (MWT) and Maximum Buffer Size (MBS).

The organization of manuscript is as follow, section 2, introduces the VP-Based ATM Ring network.
The proposed control mechanism presents in section 3. Section 4, explores the simulation results.
Finally, the conclusion produces in section 5.
II. VP-BASED ATM NETWORK
The proposed ATM network is the modified to that in [8], and more details are in [9]. The Virtual
Path (VP) concept is primarily used for nodal addressing for supporting different traffics routing.
There are many research have been done using ATM network [10-76]
Figure 1 shows a SONET/ATM Ring architecture-using point-to-point VP`s. The VP is used in the
point-to-point VP Add-Drop Multiplexing (VP-ADM) scheme carries Virtual Channel (VC)
connections between the same two ring nodes.

Figure 1 VP-Based ATM Ring network
The main goal of ADM design is to minimize the cost of evolution from the previous SONET ADM`s
to ATM ADM`s. In this architecture, each ring node pair is preassigned a duplex VP. For example, in
Figure 1, VP#2 and VP#2` (not shown in the Figure) carry all VC connections from Nodes 1 to 3 and
from Node 3 to Node 1, respectively. The physical route assignment for the VP depends upon the type
(Unidirectional or Bi-directional) of the considered SONET Ring. If the considered Ring is a
Unidirectional Ring two diverse routes which form a circle are assigned to each VP. For example, in
Figure 1, two physical routes 1-2-3 and 3-4-1 are assigned to VP#2 and VP#2` (not shown in the
figure) for Unidirectional ring. For Bi-directional ring, only one route is assigned to each duplex VP
(e.g., route 1-2-3 is assigned to both the VP#2 and VP#2`), and demands between Nodes 1 and 3 are
routed through route 1-2-3 bidirectionally, references [68,69] provide more details on SONET
Unidirectional and Bi-directional Ring architectures. In order to avoid the VP translation at
intermediate ring nodes of a VP connection, the Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) value is assigned on a
global basis. The ATM cell add-drop or pass-through at each ring node is performed by checking the
cell's VPI value. Since the VPI value has global significance and only one route is available for all
outgoing cells, it doesn`t need to translate at each intermediate ring node. Thus, no VP cross-connect
capability is needed for the ATM ADM of this ring architecture. The ATM ADM for the ring
architecture can be implemented in different ways depending on physical SONET STS-Nc
terminations. The most commonly proposed ATM STS-Nc terminations are STS-3c, STS-12c, and
STS-48c, although only the STS-3c ATM termination has been specified in current CCITT
Recommendations.
The global VPI value assignment presents no problem here, since only one route exists for all
outgoing ATM cells and the number of nodes supported by a ring is usually limited. For example, the
12-bit VPI field in the Network-to-Network Interface (NNI) ATM cell represents up to 4096 VPI
values available for use. Thus, the maximum number of ring nodes is 91; this is by considering N is
the number of ring nodes. Then, the maximum number of ring nodes is the number to be satisfying the
following equation:
[N (N - 1)] / 2 <= 4096                ( 1 )

The obtained maximum number of nodes is enough to practically support interoffice requirements and
loop rings. If the point-to-point VP ring is used to support present DS1 (1.544 Mbps) services (via

circuit emulation), each DS1 comprises a VC connection and is assigned a VPI/VCI (Virtual Channel
Identifier) based on its addressing information and the relative position of the DS1 within all the
DS1`s terminating at the same source and destination on the ring. For example, VPI= 2 and VCI = 3
represents a DS1 that is the third DS1 of the DS1 group terminating at Node 1 and Node 3.
III. THE PROPOSED CONTROL METHOD
In the earlier control methods presented in [8], there were fixed ratio among traffics along with the
time. That is caused some weak results. However, when the offered load of data traffic is more than
the voice traffic, unfairness among the traffics appears. In the proposed control mechanism method,
the number of cells to be service from a particular queue depending on its offered load.
We have assumed that the ratios of voice, and data traffics are V:D respectively. To obtain these
ratios, firstly get Minol (Minimum offered load of each traffic), then, substitute in equations 2 and 3 to
find the ratio of V and D.

Set V =
olMin
edloadvoiceoffer
,                      ( 2 )
Set D=
dataofferedload
Minol
.             ( 3 )
The proposed control mechanism method fairly serviced both traffics on the network. If the offered
load of both traffics is the same, then the ratio will be also the same. However, if it is different such as
0.25 and 0.10 respectively, then the ratio will be 2:1 for Voice and Data respectively.
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS
We've adopted discrete event driven simulation methodology to evaluate the performance of
integrated voice and data on the VP-Based ATM ring network, more details in [70]. We've considered
that the network consists of a single ATM ring ADM under voice and data traffics. The transmission
frame is fixed at 44 cells as payload depending on the channel speed at 155.52 Mbps according to the
SONET standard. Simulation checkpoint is presented here by adjusting the simulation model closed
to the analytical (queue) model [71]. We've considered the service time as effective service time
(0.0625ms) as shown in Figure 2.



Figure 2 Queue Model for ADM/ATM Node

The simulation model works as the server service cells out from the queue by the rate of 352 cell/ms
through the time interval of 0.0625 ms, then no cell service through the next interval of 0.0625 ms,
and so on. The comparison between the results of the simulation and the analytical has shown in
Figure 3. The simulation and analytical results indicate that as the Offered Load (OL) increases, the
Mean Waiting Time (MWT) and Buffer Size (Bsiz) are also increase up to saturation limit. Beyond the
saturation limit, MWT and Bsiz rapidly increase due to the large number of cells and queuing delay.
It is to be mention here that at a certain OL, the MWT and Bsiz of both simulation and analytical
models are closed, this is because the service time is equal to the effective service time (0.0625ms).

Figure 3 Simulation and Analytical Results

Our main goal of the study is to estimate the effect of the load on the Mean Waiting Time (MWT) and
Maximum Buffer Size (MBS). Then, find out the maximum load capacity that can be carried by the
proposed network.
The study of the maximum number of voice sources (Nvo) depending on the generation rate of voice
(GRvo) and data (GRda,) traffics. The calculation of the ideal values of Nvo depending on GRvo in
cell/ms, transmission rate (RT)=352 cell/ms (this is because the SONET physical transmission), and
transit rate in cell/ms, as shown in equation (4).

data traffics, MWT slightly increases with the increasing of Nvo up to the saturation limit. Beyond the
saturation limits, MWT sharply increases due to the large number of cells and queuing delay. The

Figure 5 illustrates MBS for voice and data versus number of voice sources (Nvo), for the same
parameters used in Figure 4. The behavior is similar to that of Figure 4. So, the MBS of both voice
and data traffics slightly increases with the increasing of Nvo up to the saturation limit and after that
the MBS of both voice and data traffics sharply increases due to the large number of cells waiting for
transmission. Table 2 shows the ideal and the actual maximum number of voice sources with MBS

Figure 6 shows Throughput of voice (TPvo) and data (TPda) versus Nvo, with the same values of Rvo,
µ , Msiz equals to 100 cells and constant GRda. The Figure clearly shows that TPvo increases linearly
with the increases of Nvo, this is due to the increases of number of cells. Meanwhile, TPda is constant
at 19.5 cells/ms up to the maximum (saturation) limit of Nvo, then, TPda is lightly decreases with the
increasing of Nvo, and this is because the chance of transmission data decreases, resulting in low data
throughput (TPda).

Figure 7 illustrates TPvo and TPda versus Nvo, with the same values of Rvo, µ  and Msiz equals to 200
cells. The behavior is similar to that of Figure 6, the difference is only on the saturation limit which
occurred with less number of Nvo, this is because the Msiz is larger than that in Figure 6.

that, the increasing of Nvo, slightly increases the voice MWT up to saturation limit, which depends
upon the Msiz. Beyond the saturation limit, the voice MWT sharply increases due to the large number
of cells and queuing delays. Also the effect of Msiz is very sensitive to the voice MWT and the Nvo, as
Msiz increases the voice MWT increases and Nvo decreases that is due the share data traffic to voice
traffic.

increasing of Msiz, slightly increases the data MWT up to saturation limit, which depends upon the
Nvo. Beyond the saturation limit, the voice MWT sharply increases due to the large number of cells
and queuing delays. Clearly also that the increasing of Nvo increases data MWT because the
increasing of Nvo resulting in increases service time to voice traffic, which yields increasing of Data
MWT.

V. CONCLUSION
The proposed VP-Based ATM Ring network can effectively handle voice and data traffics in the real
world network environments that's obviously from the results. In order to achieve efficient and
fairness among voice and data traffics on the proposed network, we have introduced a control
mechanism method, it bears an acceptable characteristic, maximize the guaranteed throughput for
voice traffic, estimates the effect of the load on the Mean Waiting Time (MWT) and
Maximum Buffer Size (MBS), and find out the maximum load capacity that can be carried by
the proposed network. The simulation and analytical results indicate that as the Offered Load
(OL) increases, the MWT and Buffer Size (Bsiz) are also increase up to saturation limit.
Beyond the saturation limit, MWT and Bsiz rapidly increase due to the large number of cells
and queuing delay.  The simulation results clearly show that it is an efficient and simple control
mechanism, which adapts the ratios of the voice, and the data traffics on the network resulting in a
fairly service among the voice and data traffics.
