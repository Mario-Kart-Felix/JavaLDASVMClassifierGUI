Steiner, Clifford Neuman, Jeffrey I. Schiller - IN USENIX CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS , 1988 "... In an open network computing environment, a workstation cannot be trusted to identify its users correctly to network services. Kerberos provides an alternative approach whereby a trusted third-party authentication service is used to verify users’ identities. This paper gives an overview of the Kerb ..." Abstract - Cited by 692 (12 self) - Add to MetaCart , and administrator are described. Finally, the role of Kerberos in the larger Athena picture is given, along with a list of applications that presently use Kerberos for user authentication. We describe the addition of Kerberos authentication to the Sun Network File System as a case study for integrating Kerberos Consensus and cooperation in networked multi-agent systems by Reza Olfati-saber, J. Alex Fax, Richard M. Murray - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE "... This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of ..."

An overview The structure and function of complex networks by M. E. J. Newman - SIAM REVIEW , 2003 "... Inspired by empirical studies of networked systems such as the Internet, social networks, and biological networks, researchers have in recent years developed a variety of techniques and models to help us understand or predict the behavior of these systems. Here we review developments in this field, ..."

Here we review developments in this field Systems Competition and Network Effects by Michael L. Katz, Carl Shapiro - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES—VOLUME 8, NUMBER 2—SPRING 1994—PAGES 93–115 , 1994 "... Many products have little or no value in isolation, but generate value when combined with others. Examples include: nuts and bolts, which together provide fastening services; home audio or video components and programming, which together provide entertainment services; automobiles, repair parts and ..." Abstract - Cited by 537 (6 self) - Add to MetaCart photographic services. These are all examples of products that are strongly complementary, although they need not be consumed in fixed proportions. We describe them as forming systems , which refers to collections of two or more components together with an interface that allows the components to work together System architecture directions for networked sensors by Jason Hill, Robert Szewczyk, Alec Woo, Seth Hollar, David Culler, Kristofer Pister - IN ARCHITECTURAL SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND OPERATING SYSTEMS , 2000 "... Technological progress in integrated, low-power, CMOS communication devices and sensors makes a rich design space of networked sensors viable. They can be deeply embedded in the physical world or spread throughout our environment. The missing elements are an overall system architecture and a methodo ..." Abstract - Cited by 1778 (59 self) - Add to MetaCart Technological progress in integrated, low-power, CMOS communication devices and sensors makes a rich design space of networked sensors viable. They can be deeply embedded in the physical world or spread throughout our environment. The missing elements are an overall system architecture and a Timing-Sync Protocol for Sensor Networks by Saurabh Ganeriwal, Ram Kumar, Mani B. Srivastava - The First ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor System (SenSys , 2003 "... Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have emerged as an interesting and important research area in the last few years. The applications envisioned for such networks require collaborative execution of a distributed task amongst a large set of sensor nodes. This is realized by exchanging messages that are ..." Abstract - Cited by 514 (8 self) - Add to MetaCart that are timestamped using the local clocks on the nodes. Therefore, time synchronization becomes an indispensable piece of infrastructure in such systems . For years, protocols such as NTP have kept the clocks of networked systems in perfect synchrony. However, this new class of networks has a large density of nodes The nesC language: A holistic approach to networked embedded systems by David Gay, Matt Welsh, Philip Levis, Eric Brewer, Robert Von Behren, David Culler - In Proceedings of Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI , 2003 "... We present nesC, a programming language for networked embedded systems that represent a new design space for application developers. An example of a networked embedded system is a sensor network, which consists of (potentially) thousands of tiny, lowpower “motes, ” each of which execute concurrent, ..."

Anderson, Michael D. Dahlin, Jeanna M. Neefe, David A. Patterson, Drew S. Roselli, Randolph Y. Wang - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS , 1995 "... In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for network file system design, serverless network file systems. While traditional network file systems rely on a central server machine, a serverless system utilizes workstations cooperating as peers to provide all file system services. Any machine in the sy ..."
