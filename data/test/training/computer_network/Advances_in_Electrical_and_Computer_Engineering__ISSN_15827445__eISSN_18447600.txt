Big data, characterized by high volume, diversity and velocity, increasingly drives decision making and is changing the landscape of business intelligence, from governments to private organizations, from communities to individuals. Big data analytics that discover insights from evidences has a high demand for computing efficiency, knowledge discovery, problem solving, and event prediction. We dedicate a special section of Issue 4/2017 to IoT . Prospective authors are asked to make the submissions for this section no later than the 31st of May 2017, placing "Big Data - " before the paper title in OpenConf. 2017-Jan-30 We have the confirmation Advances in Electrical and Computer Engineering will be included in the Gale database. 2016-Dec-17 IoT is a new emerging technology domain which will be used to connect all objects through the Internet for remote sensing and control. IoT uses a combination of WSN (Wireless Sensor Network), M2M (Machine to Machine), robotics, wireless networking, Internet technologies, and Smart Devices.

Big data, characterized by high volume, diversity and velocity, increasingly drives decision making and is changing the landscape of business intelligence, from governments to private organizations, from communities to individuals. Big data analytics that discover insights from evidences has a high demand for computing efficiency, knowledge discovery, problem solving, and event prediction. The overall aim of this special section is to collect state-of-the-art research findings on the latest development, up-to-date issues, and challenges in the field of big data. Proposed submissions should be original, unpublished, and novel in-depth research that makes significant methodological or application contributions.

(201702161620) Guest Editor: Radu-Emil PRECUP       CALL FOR REVIEWERS Peer review is a key element of the scientific publication process, as it ensures research results are properly verified before being published and improves the overall quality of the articles. We are strengthening our review team in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Computer Networks, Data Transmissions, and Electronics. Volunteers in other fields covered by AECE are also welcome. If you are interested in volunteer as a peer review, you are asked to send a letter of intention and a list of the most relevant 5 (five) published papers (please include the DOI of each paper) to editor@aece.ro . Please mention your RESEARCHERID , SCOPUS Author ID , and/or ORCID . Only selected applicants will be contacted. (201612171525)   Advances in Electrical and Computer Engineering ® (Adv. Electr. Comp. Eng. - ISO4 abbreviated title) is a peer-reviewed journal published by the Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava . This journal is indexed and abstracted in Science Citation Index Expanded ® and Journal Citation Reports/Science Edition ® by Thomson Reuters (former ISI ). The Journal policy is to publish high quality original scientific articles with permission from the Editorial Board. The principal aim of the journal is to bring together the latest research and development in various fields of science and technology such as electrical engineering, electrotechnics, electric machines modeling and design, control of electric drive systems, non-conventional energy conversion, sensors, electronics, communications, data transmission, energy converters, transducers modeling and design, electro-physics, nanotechnology, computer science, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, knowledge engineering, process control theory and applications, distributed systems, computer networks and software engineering. Papers must be written in English and they must not have been previously published and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. In sixteen years of existence, researchers from more than 50 countries have chosen AECE journal for the submission of their manuscripts and high profile researchers from 15 countries have joined AECE International Scientific Board. The Editorial Board is looking forward to further improve the quality of AECE journal and to broaden the impact of AECE articles. We provide on-line full-text free access to all published papers.
