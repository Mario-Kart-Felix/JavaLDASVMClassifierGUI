His Ph.D. dissertation was on semiparametric inference for independent component analysis. He was a Member of Technical Staff at Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ, from Aug 2004 to Aug 2010 with research in statistical methodologies and applications mostly with network data. Since then, he works as a Statistician at Google.
