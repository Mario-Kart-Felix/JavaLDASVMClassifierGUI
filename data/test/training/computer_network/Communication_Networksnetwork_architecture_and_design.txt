Investigating the Relationship Between QoS and QoE in aMixed DesktopHandheld Gaming SettingMaarten Wijnants Stijn Agten Peter Quax Wim LamotteHasselt University  tUL  IBBT  Expertise Centre for Digital MediaWetenschapspark 2, 3590 Diepenbeek, Belgiummaarten.wijnants,stijn.agten,peter.quax,wim.lamotteuhasselt.beABSTRACTInnovative software and system development requires a multidisciplinary approach where technical, objectively quantifiable Quality of Service aspects are integrated with and correlated to subjective Quality of Experience measures such asusability, user expectations and experiences. To date, QoSand QoE research has however mainly been carried out inan isolated manner. Their exact correlation consequentlyremains unclear. Using a collaborative multiplatform gameas case study, we intend to investigate this relationship andhope to bridge the divide that currently exists between social, useroriented research and technicallyoriented application development by formulating recommendations andguidelines. To implement the QoS and QoE optimizations,we will rely on the NIProxy, a network proxy equipped withnetwork traffic shaping and service provision functionality.Categories and Subject DescriptorsC.2.1 Computer Systems Organization ComputerCommunication Networksnetwork architecture and designGeneral TermsExperimentation, Human Factors, Measurement, PerformanceKeywordsQoS, QoE, NIProxy, MultiPlatform Gaming1. INTRODUCTIONQuality of Service QoS is a wellestablished concept insoftware and system engineering. It is a measure of technological excellence as it denotes the capability of systems toguarantee that a certain level of performance will be met.Quality of Experience QoE on the other hand deals withuser expectation, satisfaction and overall experience. Compared to QoS, it is a subjective metric that involves humandimensions and that is hence not easily quantified or objectively measured. A common approach to obtain QoE feedback is through qualitative user studies.Despite their different perspective, QoS and QoE are unquestionably related. The level of service provided by anapplication or software system is sure to influence the userCopyright is held by the authorowners.CoNEXT Student Workshop09, December 1, 2009, Rome, Italy.ACM 97816055875160912.satisfaction. On the other hand, a high QoS level not necessarily yields an excellent QoE. As a result, there is a needto thoroughly chart the relationship between both concepts.To date however, QoSQoE research has largely been carried out in a fragmented manner, focusing on measuringand optimizing either objective technical QoS parameters orsubjective QoE dimensions. In the former category, 1 forinstance presents a methodology for devising a crosslayerperformanceenergy tradeoff, however without consideringthe user satisfaction. An example in the latter category isthe study described in 2, which relates video quality touser experience in the context of a video conferencing system, without linking the findings to objective QoS factorsthat can be applied to network services. Our goal is to bridgethe QoSQoE gap and to uncover the correlation betweenboth concepts.2. QoSQoE RESEARCH IN A HETEROGENEOUS GAMING ENVIRONMENTTo carry out our research, we have selected online computer gaming as target application domain. Networked gaming is a suitable setting to perform QoSQoE studies as itimposes numerous QoS and QoErelated requirements thatare likely to have a significant impact on the user experience. Examples include the distribution of realtime gamedata, the visualization of gamerelated data on the enduser device, audiovisual communication capabilities between players and efficient user interaction mechanisms. Tofurther increase the number of possible QoSQoE links, acollaborative multiplatform gaming scenario is envisionedwhere desktop and mobile players need to cooperate to accomplish shared objectives. Besides heterogeneity in theenduser device space, the multiplatform setting also introduces variability in connectivity and network performancei.e. wired versus wireless network connections. For thehandheld devices, we have opted to use smartphones running Googles Android OS.3. METHODOLOGYWithin this gaming context, we plan to monitor and optimize QoS as well as QoE parameters and to investigatetheir correlation and the way they influence each other. QoSmeasurement and optimization will take place on both network and device level. On the network level, we will deploy probes to deduce network capacity and performancein terms of throughput, error rate, latency, . . . , performnetwork traffic shaping and bandwidth brokering to ensure29Figure 1 NIProxy deployment in the targeted desktophandheld gaming setting.optimal use of the available capacity, deliberately adapt network traffic during dissemination, and so on. Regarding device QoS parameters, factors that will be considered includedevice capabilities and features such as audiovisual codecsupport and performancerelated statistics achieved framerate, battery lifetime, CPU utilization, etcetera. Concerning QoE, we will evaluate mechanisms which allow users tospecify their preferences as well as other contextual information e.g. environmental factors and we will examine theability to determine such information implicitly e.g. automated user profiling. To obtain QoErelated data, we planto organize qualitative user studies in a living lab test environment that is representative for the reallife setting inwhich the application is to be used. The goal of these studieswill be to determine user expectations e.g. by interviewingusers before the gaming session is started, to attempt toquantify user satisfaction e.g. through observation duringplay and to collect user feedback for instance through aquestionnaire or postgaming interview.Based on the data collected in this particular gaming context, we will attempt to identify the mutual influence QoSand QoE parameters have on each other and we will tryto translate our findings into a set of recommendations andguidelines for designers and developers.4. NETWORK INTELLIGENCE PROXYA central role in our QoSQoE research will be reservedfor the Network Intelligence Proxy NIProxy, see figure 13. The NIProxy is a network intermediary which attemptsto optimize the experience of users of distributed applications by introducing different types of intelligence in the network infrastructure. The NIProxys contextual knowledge isthreefold and includes information regarding the networkingsubstrate, the application and the users terminal. This intelligence is exerted to implement two distinct yet interoperable user experience optimization techniques, namely network traffic shaping and multimedia service provision. Inthe former technique, the NIProxys gathered intelligenceis exploited to manage the bandwidth consumption of distributed applications and the way bandwidth is distributedamong involved network flows. The service provision mechanism on the other hand enables the NIProxy to innetworkprocess data that is exchanged as part of distributed applications.We expect the NIProxys optimization mechanisms willenable adequate response to fluctuations in QoS and QoEparameters in the envisioned gaming scenario. Its networktraffic shaping functionality will for instance allow the NIProxy to react to variable network connection throughputby reshuffling network flow bandwidth assignment based onrelative flow importance. By applying services on the otherhand, the NIProxy will be able to streamline data dissemination and to mitigate mismatches between the capabilitiesof desktop and handheld devices. Anticipated services include the addition of FEC protection to data that needsto be transmitted over errorprone i.e. wireless networklinks, the transcoding of multimedia data to lower qualityto reduce their bitrate in times of bandwidth shortage, themixing of multiple audio streams into a single signal to reduce bandwidth consumption and to alleviate the load onthe handheld terminal, content adaptation based on terminal capabilities and altering user preferences, combiningmultiple video streams into a mosaic, ans so on.The influence of the decisions and actions taken by the NIProxy on the user satisfaction will be investigated throughaforementioned living lab user studies. Based on the resulting QoE measurements and user feedback, the operation ofthe NIProxy will be adjusted where needed. This will bean iterative process, meaning the adjustments implementedbased on previous QoE findings will be subjected to subsequent user studies.5. CURRENT STATUS AND NEXT STEPSWe are currently in the process of implementing a multiplatform game that will serve as subject for our QoSQoEresearch. One aspect we are paying particular attention to isinterplayer audiovisual communication, as decent communication facilities are of paramount importance in a collaborative gaming setting. The NIProxy and its user experienceoptimization mechanisms have already been implementedand experimentally evaluated in multiple contexts. Readilyavailable NIProxy services include video transcoding, a service to FECprotect data and a video mosaic service. Shortterm action points include the further development of themultiplatform game and extending it with an AugmentedReality AR aspect, the implementation of additional NIProxy services, the preparation of the living lab test environment and the execution of initial user studies. In themore distant future, the outcome of these studies will beanalyzed and translated into next implementational stepsand objectives.6.
