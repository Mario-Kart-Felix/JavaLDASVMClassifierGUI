Allrights reserved.PrefaceOur capabilities of both generating and collecting data have been increasing rapidly in the last several decades.Contributing factors include the widespread use of bar codes for most commercial products, the computerizationof many business, scientic and government transactions and managements, and advances in data collection toolsranging from scanned texture and image platforms, to online instrumentation in manufacturing and shopping, and tosatellite remote sensing systems. In addition, popular use of the World Wide Web as a global information system hasooded us with a tremendous amount of data and information. This explosive growth in stored data has generatedan urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can intelligently assist us in transforming the vastamounts of data into useful information and knowledge.This book explores the concepts and techniques of data mining, a promising and ourishing frontier in databasesystems and new database applications. Data mining, also popularly referred to as knowledge discovery in databasesKDD, is the automated or convenient extraction of patterns representing knowledge implicitly stored in largedatabases, data warehouses, and other massive information repositories.Data mining is a multidisciplinary eld, drawing work from areas including database technology, articial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, statistics, pattern recognition, knowledge based systems, knowledgeacquisition, information retrieval, high performance computing, and data visualization. We present the material inthis book from a database perspective. That is, we focus on issues relating to the feasibility, usefulness, eciency, andscalability of techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large databases. As a result, this book is not intendedas an introduction to database systems, machine learning, or statistics, etc., although we do provide the backgroundnecessary in these areas in order to facilitate the readers comprehension of their respective roles in data mining.Rather, the book is a comprehensive introduction to data mining, presented with database issues in focus. It shouldbe useful for computing science students, application developers, and business professionals, as well as researchersinvolved in any of the disciplines listed above.Data mining emerged during the late 1980s, has made great strides during the 1990s, and is expected to continueto ourish into the new millennium. This book presents an overall picture of the eld from a database researcherspoint of view, introducing interesting data mining techniques and systems, and discussing applications and researchdirections. An important motivation for writing this book was the need to build an organized framework for thestudy of data mining  a challenging task owing to the extensive multidisciplinary nature of this fast developingeld. We hope that this book will encourage people with dierent backgrounds and experiences to exchange theirviews regarding data mining so as to contribute towards the further promotion and shaping of this exciting anddynamic eld.To the teacherThis book is designed to give a broad, yet in depth overview of the eld of data mining. You will nd it usefulfor teaching a course on data mining at an advanced undergraduate level, or the rstyear graduate level. Inaddition, individual chapters may be included as material for courses on selected topics in database systems or inarticial intelligence. We have tried to make the chapters as selfcontained as possible. For a course taught at theundergraduate level, you might use chapters 1 to 8 as the core course material. Remaining class material may beselected from among the more advanced topics described in chapters 9 and 10. For a graduate level course, you maychoose to cover the entire book in one semester.Each chapter ends with a set of exercises, suitable as assigned homework. The exercises are either short questionsiiithat test basic mastery of the material covered, or longer questions which require analytical thinking.To the studentWe hope that this textbook will spark your interest in the fresh, yet evolving eld of data mining. We have attemptedto present the material in a clear manner, with careful explanation of the topics covered. Each chapter ends with asummary describing the main points. We have included many gures and illustrations throughout the text in orderto make the book more enjoyable and readerfriendly. Although this book was designed as a textbook, we havetried to organize it so that it will also be useful to you as a reference book or handbook, should you later decide topursue a career in data mining.What do you need to know in order to read this book You should have some knowledge of the concepts and terminology associated with database systems. However,we do try to provide enough background of the basics in database technology, so that if your memory is a bitrusty, you will not have trouble following the discussions in the book. You should have some knowledge ofdatabase querying, although knowledge of any specic query language is not required. You should have some programming experience. In particular, you should be able to read pseudocode, andunderstand simple data structures such as multidimensional arrays. It will be helpful to have some preliminary background in statistics, machine learning, or pattern recognition.However, we will familiarize you with the basic concepts of these areas that are relevant to data mining froma database perspective.To the professionalThis book was designed to cover a broad range of topics in the eld of data mining. As a result, it is a good handbookon the subject. Because each chapter is designed to be as standalone as possible, you can focus on the topics thatmost interest you. Much of the book is suited to applications programmers or information service managers likeyourself who wish to learn about the key ideas of data mining on their own.The techniques and algorithms presented are of practical utility. Rather than selecting algorithms that performwell on small toy databases, the algorithms described in the book are geared for the discovery of data patternshidden in large, real databases. In Chapter 10, we briey discuss data mining systems in commercial use, as wellas promising research prototypes. Each algorithm presented in the book is illustrated in pseudocode. The pseudocode is similar to the C programming language, yet is designed so that it should be easy to follow by programmersunfamiliar with C or C. If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should nd the translation of ourpseudocode into the programming language of your choice to be a fairly straightforward task.Organization of the bookThe book is organized as follows.Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the multidisciplinary eld of data mining.

Han and M. Kamber, 1998, DRAFT DO NOT COPY DO NOT DISTRIBUTE September 7, 1999This book is an introduction to what has come to be known as data mining and knowledge discovery in databases.The material in this book is presented from a database perspective, where emphasis is placed on basic data miningconcepts and techniques for uncovering interesting data patterns hidden in large data sets. The implementationmethods discussed are particularly oriented towards the development of scalable and ecient data mining tools.In this chapter, you will learn how data mining is part of the natural evolution of database technology, why datamining is important, and how it is dened. You will learn about the general architecture of data mining systems,as well as gain insight into the kinds of data on which mining can be performed, the types of patterns that can befound, and how to tell which patterns represent useful knowledge. In addition to studying a classication of datamining systems, you will read about challenging research issues for building data mining tools of the future.1.1 What motivated data mining Why is it importantNecessity is the mother of invention. English proverb.The major reason that data mining has attracted a great deal of attention in information industry in recentyears is due to the wide availability of huge amounts of data and the imminent need for turning such data intouseful information and knowledge. The information and knowledge gained can be used for applications ranging frombusiness management, production control, and market analysis, to engineering design and science exploration.Data mining can be viewed as a result of the natural evolution of information technology. An evolutionary pathhas been witnessed in the database industry in the development of the following functionalities Figure 1.1 datacollection and database creation, data management including data storage and retrieval, and database transactionprocessing, and data analysis and understanding involving data warehousing and data mining. For instance, theearly development of data collection and database creation mechanisms served as a prerequisite for later developmentof eective mechanisms for data storage and retrieval, and query and transaction processing. With numerous databasesystems oering query and transaction processing as common practice, data analysis and understanding has naturallybecome the next target.Since the 1960s, database and information technology has been evolving systematically from primitive le processing systems to sophisticated and powerful databases systems. The research and development in database systemssince the 1970s has led to the development of relational database systems where data are stored in relational tablestructures see Section 1.3.1, data modeling tools, and indexing and data organization techniques. In addition, usersgained convenient and exible data access through query languages, query processing, and user interfaces. Ecientmethods for online transaction processing OLTP, where a query is viewed as a readonly transaction, havecontributed substantially to the evolution and wide acceptance of relational technology as a major tool for ecientstorage, retrieval, and management of large amounts of data.Database technology since the mid1980s has been characterized by the popular adoption of relational technologyand an upsurge of research and development activities on new and powerful database systems. These employ ad34 CHAPTER 1.

Issues related to the distribution, diversication, and sharing of datahave been studied extensively. Heterogeneous database systems and Internetbased global information systems suchas the WorldWide Web WWW also emerged and play a vital role in the information industry.The steady and amazing progress of computer hardware technology in the past three decades has led to powerful,aordable, and large supplies of computers, data collection equipment, and storage media. This technology providesa great boost to the database and information industry, and makes a huge number of databases and informationrepositories available for transaction management, information retrieval, and data analysis.Data can now be stored in many dierent types of databases. One database architecture that has recently emergedis the data warehouse Section 1.3.2, a repository of multiple heterogeneous data sources, organized under a uniedschema at a single site in order to facilitate management decision making. Data warehouse technology includes datacleansing, data integration, and OnLine Analytical Processing OLAP, that is, analysis techniques withfunctionalities such as summarization, consolidation and aggregation, as well as the ability to view information atdierent angles. Although OLAP tools support multidimensional analysis and decision making, additional dataanalysis tools are required for indepth analysis, such as data classication, clustering, and the characterization ofdata changes over time.The abundance of data, coupled with the need for powerful data analysis tools, has been described as a datarich but information poor situation. The fastgrowing, tremendous amount of data, collected and stored in largeand numerous databases, has far exceeded our human ability for comprehension without powerful tools Figure 1.2.As a result, data collected in large databases become data tombs  data archives that are seldom revisited.Consequently, important decisions are often made based not on the informationrich data stored in databases butrather on a decision makers intuition, simply because the decision maker does not have the tools to extract thevaluable knowledge embedded in the vast amounts of data. In addition, consider current expert system technologies,which typically rely on users or domain experts to manually input knowledge into knowledge bases. Unfortunately,this procedure is prone to biases and errors, and is extremely timeconsuming and costly. Data mining tools whichperform data analysis may uncover important data patterns, contributing greatly to business strategies, knowledgebases, and scientic and medical research. The widening gap between data and information calls for a systematicdevelopment of data mining tools which will turn data tombs into golden nuggets of knowledge.6 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONKnowledgegold nuggets a mountain of dataa shovela pickbeads of sweatFigure 1.3 Data mining  searching for knowledge interesting patterns in your data.1.2 So, what is data miningSimply stated, data mining refers to extracting or mining knowledge from large amounts of data. The term isactually a misnomer. Remember that the mining of gold from rocks or sand is referred to as gold mining rather thanrock or sand mining. Thus, data mining should have been more appropriately named knowledge mining fromdata, which is unfortunately somewhat long. Knowledge mining, a shorter term, may not reect the emphasis onmining from large amounts of data. Nevertheless, mining is a vivid term characterizing the process that nds a smallset of precious nuggets from a great deal of raw material Figure 1.3. Thus, such a misnomer which carries bothdata and mining became a popular choice. There are many other terms carrying a similar or slightly dierentmeaning to data mining, such as knowledge mining from databases, knowledge extraction, datapatternanalysis, data archaeology, and data dredging.Many people treat data mining as a synonym for another popularly used term, Knowledge Discovery inDatabases, orKDD. Alternatively, others view data mining as simply an essential step in the process of knowledgediscovery in databases. Knowledge discovery as a process is depicted in Figure 1.4, and consists of an iterativesequence of the following steps data cleaning to remove noise or irrelevant data, data integration where multiple data sources may be combined1, data selection where data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved from the database, data transformation where data are transformed or consolidated into forms appropriate for mining byperforming summary or aggregation operations, for instance2, data mining an essential process where intelligent methods are applied in order to extract data patterns, pattern evaluation to identify the truly interesting patterns representing knowledge based on some interestingness measures Section 1.5, and knowledge presentation where visualization and knowledge representation techniques are used to presentthe mined knowledge to the user.1A popular trend in the information industry is to perform data cleaning and data integration as a preprocessing step where theresulting data are stored in a data warehouse.2Sometimes data transformation and consolidation are performed before the data selection process, particularly in the case of datawarehousing.1.2. SO, WHAT IS DATA MINING 7patternsknowledgeIntegrationCleaning DataMiningSelection Transformation....datawarehousedata basesflat filesEvaluation PresentationFigure 1.4 Data mining as a process of knowledge discovery.The data mining step may interact with the user or a knowledge base. The interesting patterns are presented tothe user, and may be stored as new knowledge in the knowledge base. Note that according to this view, data miningis only one step in the entire process, albeit an essential one since it uncovers hidden patterns for evaluation.We agree that data mining is a knowledge discovery process. However, in industry, in media, and in the databaseresearch milieu, the term data mining is becoming more popular than the longer term of knowledge discoveryin databases. Therefore, in this book, we choose to use the term data mining. We adopt a broad view of datamining functionality data mining is the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amounts of datastored either in databases, data warehouses, or other information repositories.Based on this view, the architecture of a typical data mining system may have the following major componentsFigure 1.51. Database, data warehouse, or other information repository. This is one or a set of databases, datawarehouses, spread sheets, or other kinds of information repositories. Data cleaning and data integrationtechniques may be performed on the data.2. Database or data warehouse server. The database or data warehouse server is responsible for fetching therelevant data, based on the users data mining request.3. Knowledge base. This is the domain knowledge that is used to guide the search, or evaluate the interestingness of resulting patterns. Such knowledge can include concept hierarchies, used to organize attributesor attribute values into dierent levels of abstraction. Knowledge such as user beliefs, which can be used toassess a patterns interestingness based on its unexpectedness, may also be included. Other examples of domainknowledge are additional interestingness constraints or thresholds, and metadata e.g., describing data frommultiple heterogeneous sources.4. Data mining engine. This is essential to the data mining system and ideally consists of a set of functionalmodules for tasks such as characterization, association analysis, classication, evolution and deviation analysis.5. Pattern evaluation module. This component typically employs interestingness measures Section 1.5 andinteracts with the data mining modules so as to focus the search towards interesting patterns. It may accessinterestingness thresholds stored in the knowledge base. Alternatively, the pattern evaluation module may be8 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONWarehouseDataDataBaseEngineData MiningDatabase orServer Data WarehouseData cleaningdata integration filteringGraphic User InterfaceKnowledgeBasePattern EvaluationFigure 1.5 Architecture of a typical data mining system.integrated with the mining module, depending on the implementation of the data mining method used. Forecient data mining, it is highly recommended to push the evaluation of pattern interestingness as deep aspossible into the mining process so as to conne the search to only the interesting patterns.6. Graphical user interface. This module communicates between users and the data mining system, allowingthe user to interact with the system by specifying a data mining query or task, providing information to helpfocus the search, and performing exploratory data mining based on the intermediate data mining results. Inaddition, this component allows the user to browse database and data warehouse schemas or data structures,evaluate mined patterns, and visualize the patterns in dierent forms.From a data warehouse perspective, data mining can be viewed as an advanced stage of online analytical processing OLAP. However, data mining goes far beyond the narrow scope of summarizationstyle analytical processingof data warehouse systems by incorporating more advanced techniques for data understanding.While there may be many data mining systems on the market, not all of them can perform true data mining.A data analysis system that does not handle large amounts of data can at most be categorized as a machine learningsystem, a statistical data analysis tool, or an experimental system prototype. A system that can only perform dataor information retrieval, including nding aggregate values, or that performs deductive query answering in largedatabases should be more appropriately categorized as either a database system, an information retrieval system, ora deductive database system.Data mining involves an integration of techniques frommultiple disciplines such as database technology, statistics,machine learning, high performance computing, pattern recognition, neural networks, data visualization, informationretrieval, image and signal processing, and spatial data analysis. We adopt a database perspective in our presentationof data mining in this book. That is, emphasis is placed on ecient and scalable data mining techniques for largedatabases. By performing data mining, interesting knowledge, regularities, or highlevel information can be extractedfrom databases and viewed or browsed from dierent angles. The discovered knowledge can be applied to decisionmaking, process control, informationmanagement, query processing, and so on. Therefore, data mining is consideredas one of the most important frontiers in database systems and one of the most promising, new database applicationsin the information industry.1.3 Data mining  on what kind of dataIn this section, we examine a number of dierent data stores on which mining can be performed. In principle,data mining should be applicable to any kind of information repository. This includes relational databases, data1.3. DATA MINING  ON WHAT KIND OF DATA 9warehouses, transactional databases, advanced database systems, at les, and the WorldWide Web. Advanceddatabase systems include objectoriented and objectrelational databases, and specic applicationoriented databases,such as spatial databases, timeseries databases, text databases, and multimedia databases. The challenges andtechniques of mining may dier for each of the repository systems.Although this book assumes that readers have primitive knowledge of information systems, we provide a briefintroduction to each of the major data repository systems listed above. In this section, we also introduce the ctitiousAllElectronics store which will be used to illustrate concepts throughout the text.1.3.1 Relational databasesA database system, also called a database management system DBMS, consists of a collection of interrelateddata, known as a database, and a set of software programs to manage and access the data. The software programsinvolve mechanisms for the denition of database structures, for data storage, for concurrent, shared or distributeddata access, and for ensuring the consistency and security of the information stored, despite system crashes orattempts at unauthorized access.A relational database is a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name. Each table consistsof a set of attributes columns or elds and usually stores a large number of tuples records or rows. Each tuplein a relational table represents an object identied by a unique key and described by a set of attribute values.Consider the following example.Example 1.1 The AllElectronics company is described by the following relation tables customer, item, employee,and branch. Fragments of the tables described here are shown in Figure 1.6. The attribute which represents key orcomposite key component of each relation is underlined. The relation customer consists of a set of attributes, including a unique customer identity number cust ID,customer name, address, age, occupation, annual income, credit information, category, etc. Similarly, each of the relations employee, branch, and items, consists of a set of attributes, describing theirproperties. Tables can also be used to represent the relationships between or among multiple relation tables. For ourexample, these include purchases customer purchases items, creating a sales transaction that is handled by anemployee, items sold lists the items sold in a given transaction, and works at employee works at a branchof AllElectronics. 2Relational data can be accessed by database queries written in a relational query language, such as SQL, orwith the assistance of graphical user interfaces. In the latter, the user may employ a menu, for example, to specifyattributes to be included in the query, and the constraints on these attributes. A given query is transformed into aset of relational operations, such as join, selection, and projection, and is then optimized for ecient processing. Aquery allows retrieval of specied subsets of the data. Suppose that your job is to analyze the AllElectronics data.Through the use of relational queries, you can ask things like Show me a list of all items that were sold in the lastquarter. Relational languages also include aggregate functions such as sum, avg average, count, max maximum,and min minimum. These allow you to nd out things like Show me the total sales of the last month, groupedby branch, or How many sales transactions occurred in the month of December, or Which sales person had thehighest amount of sales.When data mining is applied to relational databases, one can go further by searching for trends or data patterns.For example, data mining systems may analyze customer data to predict the credit risk of new customers based ontheir income, age, and previous credit information. Data mining systems may also detect deviations, such as itemswhose sales are far from those expected in comparison with the previous year. Such deviations can then be furtherinvestigated, e.g., has there been a change in packaging of such items, or a signicant increase in priceRelational databases are one of the most popularly available and rich information repositories for data mining,and thus they are a major data form in our study of data mining.10 CHAPTER 1.

Each branch hasits own set of databases. The president of AllElectronics has asked you to provide an analysis of the companys salesper item type per branch for the third quarter. This is a dicult task, particularly since the relevant data are spreadout over several databases, physically located at numerous sites.If AllElectronics had a data warehouse, this task would be easy. A data warehouse is a repository of informationcollected from multiple sources, stored under a unied schema, and which usually resides at a single site. Datawarehouses are constructed via a process of data cleansing, data transformation, data integration, data loading, andperiodic data refreshing. This process is studied in detail in Chapter 2. Figure 1.7 shows the basic architecture of adata warehouse for AllElectronics.In order to facilitate decision making, the data in a data warehouse are organized around major subjects, suchas customer, item, supplier, and activity. The data are stored to provide information from a historical perspectivesuch as from the past 510 years, and are typically summarized. For example, rather than storing the details ofeach sales transaction, the data warehouse may store a summary of the transactions per item type for each store, or,summarized to a higher level, for each sales region.A data warehouse is usually modeled by a multidimensional database structure, where each dimension corresponds to an attribute or a set of attributes in the schema, and each cell stores the value of some aggregate measure,such as count or sales amount. The actual physical structure of a data warehouse may be a relational data store ora multidimensional data cube. It provides a multidimensional view of data and allows the precomputation and12 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONsalestrans ID list of item IDsT100 I1, I3, I8, I16. . . . . .Figure 1.9 Fragment of a transactional database for sales at AllElectronics.fast accessing of summarized data.Example 1.2 A data cube for summarized sales data of AllElectronics is presented in Figure 1.8a. The cube hasthree dimensions address with city values Chicago, New York, Montreal, Vancouver, time with quarter valuesQ1, Q2, Q3, Q4, and item with item type values home entertainment, computer, phone, security. The aggregatevalue stored in each cell of the cube is sales amount. For example, the total sales for Q1 of items relating to securitysystems in Vancouver is 400K, as stored in cell hVancouver, Q1, securityi. Additional cubes may be used to storeaggregate sums over each dimension, corresponding to the aggregate values obtained using dierent SQL groupbys,e.g., the total sales amount per city and quarter, or per city and item, or per quarter and item, or per each individualdimension. 2In research literature on data warehouses, the data cube structure that stores the primitive or lowest level ofinformation is called a base cuboid. Its corresponding higher level multidimensional cube structures are callednonbase cuboids. A base cuboid together with all of its corresponding higher level cuboids form a data cube.By providing multidimensional data views and the precomputation of summarized data, data warehouse systems are well suited for OnLine Analytical Processing, or OLAP. OLAP operations make use of backgroundknowledge regarding the domain of the data being studied in order to allow the presentation of data at dierentlevels of abstraction. Such operations accommodate dierent user viewpoints. Examples of OLAP operations includedrilldown and rollup, which allow the user to view the data at diering degrees of summarization, as illustratedin Figure 1.8b. For instance, one may drill down on sales data summarized by quarter to see the data summarizedby month. Similarly, one may roll up on sales data summarized by city to view the data summarized by region.Although data warehouse tools help support data analysis, additional tools for data mining are required to allowmore in depth and automated analysis. Data warehouse technology is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.1.3.3 Transactional databasesIn general, a transactional database consists of a le where each record represents a transaction. A transactiontypically includes a unique transaction identity number trans ID, and a list of the itemsmaking up the transactionsuch as items purchased in a store. The transactional database may have additional tables associated with it, whichcontain other information regarding the sale, such as the date of the transaction, the customer ID number, the IDnumber of the sales person, and of the branch at which the sale occurred, and so on.Example 1.3 Transactions can be stored in a table, with one record per transaction. A fragment of a transactionaldatabase for AllElectronics is shown in Figure 1.9. From the relational database point of view, the sales table inFigure 1.9 is a nested relation because the attribute list of item IDs contains a set of items. Since most relationaldatabase systems do not support nested relational structures, the transactional database is usually either stored in aat le in a format similar to that of the table in Figure 1.9, or unfolded into a standard relation in a format similarto that of the items sold table in Figure 1.6. 2As an analyst of the AllElectronics database, you may like to ask Show me all the items purchased by SandySmith or How many transactions include item number I3. Answering such queries may require a scan of theentire transactional database.Suppose you would like to dig deeper into the data by asking Which items sold well together. This kind ofmarket basket data analysis would enable you to bundle groups of items together as a strategy for maximizing sales.For example, given the knowledge that printers are commonly purchased together with computers, you could oer1.4. DATA MINING FUNCTIONALITIES  WHAT KINDS OF PATTERNS CAN BE MINED 13an expensive model of printers at a discount to customers buying selected computers, in the hopes of selling moreof the expensive printers. A regular data retrieval system is not able to answer queries like the one above. However,data mining systems for transactional data can do so by identifying sets of items which are frequently sold together.1.3.4 Advanced database systems and advanced database applicationsRelational database systems have been widely used in business applications. With the advances of database technology, various kinds of advanced database systems have emerged and are undergoing development to address therequirements of new database applications.The new database applications include handling spatial data such as maps, engineering design data suchas the design of buildings, system components, or integrated circuits, hypertext and multimedia data includingtext, image, video, and audio data, timerelated data such as historical records or stock exchange data, and theWorldWide Web a huge, widely distributed information repository made available by Internet. These applicationsrequire ecient data structures and scalable methods for handling complex object structures, variable length records,semistructured or unstructured data, text and multimedia data, and database schemas with complex structures anddynamic changes.In response to these needs, advanced database systems and specic applicationoriented database systems havebeen developed. These include objectoriented and objectrelational database systems, spatial database systems, temporal and timeseries database systems, text and multimedia database systems, heterogeneous and legacy databasesystems, and the Webbased global information systems.While such databases or information repositories require sophisticated facilities to eciently store, retrieve, andupdate large amounts of complex data, they also provide fertile grounds and raise many challenging research andimplementation issues for data mining.1.4 Data mining functionalities  what kinds of patterns can be minedWe have observed various types of data stores and database systems on which data mining can be performed. Letus now examine the kinds of data patterns that can be mined.Data mining functionalities are used to specify the kind of patterns to be found in data mining tasks. In general,data mining tasks can be classied into two categories descriptive and predictive. Descriptive mining taskscharacterize the general properties of the data in the database. Predictive mining tasks perform inference on thecurrent data in order to make predictions.In some cases, users may have no idea of which kinds of patterns in their data may be interesting, and hence maylike to search for several dierent kinds of patterns in parallel. Thus it is important to have a data mining system thatcan mine multiple kinds of patterns to accommodate dierent user expectations or applications. Furthermore, datamining systems should be able to discover patterns at various granularities i.e., dierent levels of abstraction. Toencourage interactive and exploratory mining, users should be able to easily play with the output patterns, such asby mouse clicking. Operations that can be specied by simple mouse clicks include adding or dropping a dimensionor an attribute, swapping rows and columns pivoting, or axis rotation, changing dimension representationse.g., from a 3D cube to a sequence of 2D cross tabulations, or crosstabs, or using OLAP rollup or drilldownoperations along dimensions. Such operations allow data patterns to be expressed from dierent angles of view andat multiple levels of abstraction.Data mining systems should also allow users to specify hints to guide or focus the search for interesting patterns.Since some patterns may not hold for all of the data in the database, a measure of certainty or trustworthiness isusually associated with each discovered pattern.Data mining functionalities, and the kinds of patterns they can discover, are described below.1.4.1 Conceptclass description characterization and discriminationData can be associated with classes or concepts. For example, in the AllElectronics store, classes of items forsale include computers and printers, and concepts of customers include bigSpenders and budgetSpenders. It can beuseful to describe individual classes and concepts in summarized, concise, and yet precise terms. Such descriptionsof a class or a concept are called classconcept descriptions. These descriptions can be derived via 1 data14 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONcharacterization, by summarizing the data of the class under study often called the target class in general terms,or 2 data discrimination, by comparison of the target class with one or a set of comparative classes often calledthe contrasting classes, or 3 both data characterization and discrimination.Data characterization is a summarization of the general characteristics or features of a target class of data. Thedata corresponding to the userspecied class are typically collected by a database query. For example, to study thecharacteristics of software products whose sales increased by 10 in the last year, one can collect the data relatedto such products by executing an SQL query.There are several methods for eective data summarization and characterization. For instance, the data cubebased OLAP rollup operation Section 1.3.2 can be used to perform usercontrolled data summarization along aspecied dimension. This process is further detailed in Chapter 2 which discusses data warehousing. An attributeoriented induction technique can be used to perform data generalization and characterization without stepbystepuser interaction. This technique is described in Chapter 5.The output of data characterization can be presented in various forms. Examples include pie charts, bar charts,curves, multidimensional data cubes, and multidimensional tables, including crosstabs. The resulting descriptions can also be presented as generalized relations, or in rule form called characteristic rules. Thesedierent output forms and their transformations are discussed in Chapter 5.Example 1.4 A data mining system should be able to produce a description summarizing the characteristics ofcustomers who spend more than 1000 a year at AllElectronics. The result could be a general prole of the customerssuch as they are 4050 years old, employed, and have excellent credit ratings. The system should allow users to drilldown on any dimension, such as on employment in order to view these customers according to their occupation.2Data discrimination is a comparison of the general features of target class data objects with the general featuresof objets from one or a set of contrasting classes. The target and contrasting classes can be specied by the user,and the corresponding data objects retrieved through data base queries. For example, one may like to compare thegeneral features of software products whose sales increased by 10 in the last year with those whose sales decreasedby at least 30 during the same period.The methods used for data discrimination are similar to those used for data characterization. The forms of outputpresentation are also similar, although discrimination descriptions should include comparative measures which helpdistinguish between the target and contrasting classes. Discrimination descriptions expressed in rule form are referredto as discriminant rules. The user should be able to manipulate the output for characteristic and discriminantdescriptions.Example 1.5 A data mining system should be able to compare two groups of AllElectronics customers, such asthose who shop for computer products regularly more than 4 times a month vs. those who rarely shop for suchproducts i.e., less than three times a year. The resulting description could be a general, comparative prole of thecustomers such as 80 of the customers who frequently purchase computer products are between 2040 years oldand have a university education, whereas 60 of the customers who infrequently buy such products are either old oryoung, and have no university degree. Drillingdown on a dimension, such as occupation, or adding new dimensions,such as income level, may help in nding even more discriminative features between the two classes. 2Concept description, including characterization and discrimination, is the topic of Chapter 5.1.4.2 Association analysisAssociation analysis is the discovery of association rules showing attributevalue conditions that occur frequentlytogether in a given set of data. Association analysis is widely used for market basket or transaction data analysis.More formally, association rules are of the form X  Y , i.e., A1     Am  B1     Bn, where Ai fori 2 f1    mg and Bj for j 2 f1     ng are attributevalue pairs. The association rule X  Y is interpreted asdatabase tuples that satisfy the conditions in X are also likely to satisfy the conditions in Y .Example 1.6 Given the AllElectronics relational database, a data mining system may nd association rules likeageX 20 29  incomeX 20 30K  buysX CD player support  2 confidence  601.4. DATA MINING FUNCTIONALITIES  WHAT KINDS OF PATTERNS CAN BE MINED 15meaning that of the AllElectronics customers under study, 2 support are 2029 years of age with an income of2030K and have purchased a CD player at AllElectronics. There is a 60 probability condence, or certaintythat a customer in this age and income group will purchase a CD player.Note that this is an association between more than one attribute, or predicate i.e., age, income, and buys.Adopting the terminology used in multidimensional databases, where each attribute is referred to as a dimension,the above rule can be referred to as a multidimensional association rule.Suppose, as a marketing manager of AllElectronics, you would like to determine which items are frequentlypurchased together within the same transactions. An example of such a rule iscontainsT computer  containsT software support  1 confidence  50meaning that if a transaction T contains computer, there is a 50 chance that it contains software as well,and 1 of all of the transactions contain both. This association rule involves a single attribute or predicate i.e.,contains which repeats. Association rules that contain a single predicate are referred to as singledimensionalassociation rules. Dropping the predicate notation, the above rule can be written simply as computer  software1, 50. 2In recent years, many algorithms have been proposed for the ecient mining of association rules. Associationrule mining is discussed in detail in Chapter 6.1.4.3 Classication and predictionClassication is the processing of nding a set ofmodels or functions which describe and distinguish data classesor concepts, for the purposes of being able to use the model to predict the class of objects whose class label isunknown. The derived model is based on the analysis of a set of training data i.e., data objects whose class labelis known.The derived model may be represented in various forms, such as classication IFTHEN rules, decision trees,mathematical formulae, or neural networks. A decision tree is a owchartlike tree structure, where each nodedenotes a test on an attribute value, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and tree leaves represent classesor class distributions. Decision trees can be easily converted to classication rules. A neural network is a collectionof linear threshold units that can be trained to distinguish objects of dierent classes.Classication can be used for predicting the class label of data objects. However, in many applications, one maylike to predict some missing or unavailable data values rather than class labels. This is usually the case when thepredicted values are numerical data, and is often specically referred to as prediction. Although prediction mayrefer to both data value prediction and class label prediction, it is usually conned to data value prediction andthus is distinct from classication. Prediction also encompasses the identication of distribution trends based on theavailable data.Classication and prediction may need to be preceded by relevance analysis which attempts to identify attributes that do not contribute to the classication or prediction process. These attributes can then be excluded.Example 1.7 Suppose, as sales manager of AllElectronics, you would like to classify a large set of items in the store,based on three kinds of responses to a sales campaign good response, mild response, and no response. You would liketo derive a model for each of these three classes based on the descriptive features of the items, such as price, brand,place made, type, and category. The resulting classication should maximally distinguish each class from the others,presenting an organized picture of the data set. Suppose that the resulting classication is expressed in the form ofa decision tree. The decision tree, for instance, may identify price as being the single factor which best distinguishesthe three classes. The tree may reveal that, after price, other features which help further distinguish objects of eachclass from another include brand and place made. Such a decision tree may help you understand the impact of thegiven sales campaign, and design a more eective campaign for the future. 2Chapter 7 discusses classication and prediction in further detail.16 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONFigure 1.10 A 2D plot of customer data with respect to customer locations in a city, showing three data clusters.Each cluster center is marked with a .1.4.4 Clustering analysisUnlike classication and predication, which analyze classlabeled data objects, clustering analyzes data objectswithout consulting a known class label. In general, the class labels are not present in the training data simplybecause they are not known to begin with. Clustering can be used to generate such labels. The objects are clusteredor grouped based on the principle of maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity.That is, clusters of objects are formed so that objects within a cluster have high similarity in comparison to oneanother, but are very dissimilar to objects in other clusters. Each cluster that is formed can be viewed as a classof objects, from which rules can be derived. Clustering can also facilitate taxonomy formation, that is, theorganization of observations into a hierarchy of classes that group similar events together.Example 1.8 Clustering analysis can be performed on AllElectronics customer data in order to identify homogeneous subpopulations of customers. These clusters may represent individual target groups for marketing. Figure 1.10shows a 2D plot of customers with respect to customer locations in a city. Three clusters of data points are evident.2Clustering analysis forms the topic of Chapter 8.1.4.5 Evolution and deviation analysisData evolution analysis describes and models regularities or trends for objects whose behavior changes over time.Although this may include characterization, discrimination, association, classication, or clustering of timerelateddata, distinct features of such an analysis include timeseries data analysis, sequence or periodicity pattern matching,and similaritybased data analysis.Example 1.9 Suppose that you have the major stock market timeseries data of the last several years availablefrom the New York Stock Exchange and you would like to invest in shares of hightech industrial companies. A datamining study of stock exchange data may identify stock evolution regularities for overall stocks and for the stocks ofparticular companies. Such regularities may help predict future trends in stock market prices, contributing to yourdecision making regarding stock investments. 2In the analysis of timerelated data, it is often desirable not only to model the general evolutionary trend ofthe data, but also to identify data deviations which occur over time. Deviations are dierences between measuredvalues and corresponding references such as previous values or normative values. A data mining system performingdeviation analysis, upon the detection of a set of deviations, may do the following describe the characteristics ofthe deviations, try to explain the reason behind them, and suggest actions to bring the deviated values back to theirexpected values.1.5. ARE ALL OF THE PATTERNS INTERESTING 17Example 1.10 A decrease in total sales at AllElectronics for the last month, in comparison to that of the samemonth of the last year, is a deviation pattern. Having detected a signicant deviation, a data mining system may gofurther and attempt to explain the detected pattern e.g., did the company have more sales personnel last year incomparison to the same period this year. 2Data evolution and deviation analysis are discussed in Chapter 9.1.5 Are all of the patterns interestingA data mining system has the potential to generate thousands or even millions of patterns, or rules. Are all of thepatterns interesting Typically not  only a small fraction of the patterns potentially generated would actually beof interest to any given user.This raises some serious questions for data mining What makes a pattern interesting Can a data mining systemgenerate all of the interesting patterns Can a data mining system generate only the interesting patternsTo answer the rst question, a pattern is interesting if 1 it is easily understood by humans, 2 valid on newor test data with some degree of certainty, 3 potentially useful, and 4 novel. A pattern is also interesting if itvalidates a hypothesis that the user sought to conrm. An interesting pattern represents knowledge.Several objective measures of pattern interestingness exist. These are based on the structure of discoveredpatterns and the statistics underlying them. An objective measure for association rules of the form X  Y is rulesupport, representing the percentage of data samples that the given rule satises. Another objective measure forassociation rules is condence, which assesses the degree of certainty of the detected association. It is dened asthe conditional probability that a pattern Y is true given that X is true. More formally, support and condence aredened assupportX  Y   ProbfX  Y gcondence X  Y   ProbfY jXgIn general, each interestingness measure is associated with a threshold, which may be controlled by the user. Forexample, rules that do not satisfy a condence threshold of say, 50, can be considered uninteresting. Rules belowthe threshold likely reect noise, exceptions, or minority cases, and are probably of less value.Although objective measures help identify interesting patterns, they are insucient unless combined with subjective measures that reect the needs and interests of a particular user. For example, patterns describing thecharacteristics of customers who shop frequently at AllElectronics should interest the marketing manager, but maybe of little interest to analysts studying the same database for patterns on employee performance. Furthermore, manypatterns that are interesting by objective standards may represent common knowledge, and therefore, are actuallyuninteresting. Subjective interestingness measures are based on user beliefs in the data. These measures ndpatterns interesting if they are unexpected contradicting a user belief or oer strategic information on which theuser can act. In the latter case, such patterns are referred to as actionable. Patterns that are expected can beinteresting if they conrm a hypothesis that the user wished to validate, or resemble a users hunch.The second question, Can a data mining system generate all of the interesting patterns, refers to the completeness of a data mining algorithm. It is unrealistic and inecient for data mining systems to generate all of thepossible patterns. Instead, a focused search which makes use of interestingness measures should be used to controlpattern generation. This is often sucient to ensure the completeness of the algorithm. Association rule mining isan example where the use of interestingness measures can ensure the completeness of mining. The methods involvedare examined in detail in Chapter 6.Finally, the third question, Can a data mining system generate only the interesting patterns, is an optimizationproblem in data mining. It is highly desirable for data mining systems to generate only the interesting patterns.This would be much more ecient for users and data mining systems, since neither would have to search throughthe patterns generated in order to identify the truely interesting ones. Such optimization remains a challenging issuein data mining.Measures of pattern interestingness are essential for the ecient discovery of patterns of value to the given user.Such measures can be used after the data mining step in order to rank the discovered patterns according to theirinterestingness, ltering out the uninteresting ones. More importantly, such measures can be used to guide and18 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTIONMachineLearningStatisticsSystemsDatabase ScienceInformationVisualization Other disciplinesFigure 1.11 Data mining as a conuence of multiple disciplines.constrain the discovery process, improving the search eciency by pruning away subsets of the pattern space thatdo not satisfy prespecied interestingness constraints.Methods to assess pattern interestingness, and their use to improve data mining eciency are discussed throughoutthe book, with respect to each kind of pattern that can be mined.1.6 A classication of data mining systemsData mining is an interdisciplinary eld, the conuence of a set of disciplines as shown in Figure 1.11, includingdatabase systems, statistics, machine learning, visualization, and information science. Moreover, depending on thedata mining approach used, techniques from other disciplines may be applied, such as neural networks, fuzzy andorrough set theory, knowledge representation, inductive logic programming, or high performance computing. Dependingon the kinds of data to be mined or on the given data mining application, the data mining system may also integratetechniques from spatial data analysis, information retrieval, pattern recognition, image analysis, signal processing,computer graphics, Web technology, economics, or psychology.Because of the diversity of disciplines contributing to data mining, data mining research is expected to generatea large variety of data mining systems. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a clear classication of data miningsystems. Such a classication may help potential users distinguish data mining systems and identify those that bestmatch their needs. Data mining systems can be categorized according to various criteria, as follows. Classication according to the kinds of databases mined.A data mining system can be classied according to the kinds of databases mined. Database systems themselvescan be classied according to dierent criteria such as data models, or the types of data or applicationsinvolved, each of which may require its own data mining technique. Data mining systems can therefore beclassied accordingly.For instance, if classifying according to data models, we may have a relational, transactional, objectoriented,objectrelational, or data warehouse mining system. If classifying according to the special types of data handled,we may have a spatial, timeseries, text, or multimedia data mining system, or a WorldWide Web miningsystem. Other system types include heterogeneous data mining systems, and legacy data mining systems. Classication according to the kinds of knowledge mined.Data mining systems can be categorized according to the kinds of knowledge they mine, i.e., based on datamining functionalities, such as characterization, discrimination, association, classication, clustering, trend andevolution analysis, deviation analysis, similarity analysis, etc. A comprehensive data mining system usuallyprovides multiple andor integrated data mining functionalities.Moreover, data mining systems can also be distinguished based on the granularity or levels of abstraction of theknowledge mined, including generalized knowledge at a high level of abstraction, primitivelevel knowledgeat a raw data level, or knowledge at multiple levels considering several levels of abstraction. An advanceddata mining system should facilitate the discovery of knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction. Classication according to the kinds of techniques utilized.1.7. MAJOR ISSUES IN DATA MINING 19Data mining systems can also be categorized according to the underlying data mining techniques employed.These techniques can be described according to the degree of user interaction involved e.g., autonomoussystems, interactive exploratory systems, querydriven systems, or the methods of data analysis employed e.g.,databaseoriented or data warehouseoriented techniques, machine learning, statistics, visualization, patternrecognition, neural networks, and so on. A sophisticated data mining system will often adopt multiple datamining techniques or work out an eective, integrated technique which combines the merits of a few individualapproaches.Chapters 5 to 8 of this book are organized according to the various kinds of knowledge mined. In Chapter 9, wediscuss the mining of dierent kinds of data on a variety of advanced and applicationoriented database systems.1.7 Major issues in data miningThe scope of this book addresses major issues in data mining regarding mining methodology, user interaction,performance, and diverse data types. These issues are introduced below1. Mining methodology and userinteraction issues. These reect the kinds of knowledge mined, the abilityto mine knowledge at multiple granularities, the use of domain knowledge, adhoc mining, and knowledgevisualization. Mining dierent kinds of knowledge in databases.Since dierent users can be interested in dierent kinds of knowledge, data mining should cover a widespectrum of data analysis and knowledge discovery tasks, including data characterization, discrimination,association, classication, clustering, trend and deviation analysis, and similarity analysis. These tasksmay use the same database in dierent ways and require the development of numerous data miningtechniques. Interactive mining of knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction.Since it is dicult to know exactly what can be discovered within a database, the data mining processshould be interactive. For databases containing a huge amount of data, appropriate sampling technique canrst be applied to facilitate interactive data exploration. Interactive mining allows users to focus the searchfor patterns, providing and rening data mining requests based on returned results. Specically, knowledgeshould be mined by drillingdown, rollingup, and pivoting through the data space and knowledge spaceinteractively, similar to what OLAP can do on data cubes. In this way, the user can interact with the datamining system to view data and discovered patterns at multiple granularities and from dierent angles. Incorporation of background knowledge.Background knowledge, or information regarding the domain under study, may be used to guide thediscovery process and allow discovered patterns to be expressed in concise terms and at dierent levels ofabstraction. Domain knowledge related to databases, such as integrity constraints and deduction rules,can help focus and speed up a data mining process, or judge the interestingness of discovered patterns. Data mining query languages and adhoc data mining.Relational query languages such as SQL allow users to pose adhoc queries for data retrieval. In a similarvein, highlevel data mining query languages need to be developed to allow users to describe adhocdata mining tasks by facilitating the specication of the relevant sets of data for analysis, the domainknowledge, the kinds of knowledge to be mined, and the conditions and interestingness constraints tobe enforced on the discovered patterns. Such a language should be integrated with a database or datawarehouse query language, and optimized for ecient and exible data mining. Presentation and visualization of data mining results.Discovered knowledge should be expressed in highlevel languages, visual representations, or other expressive forms so that the knowledge can be easily understood and directly usable by humans. This isespecially crucial if the data mining system is to be interactive. This requires the system to adopt expressive knowledge representation techniques, such as trees, tables, rules, graphs, charts, crosstabs, matrices,or curves.20 CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION Handling outlier or incomplete data.The data stored in a database may reect outliers  noise, exceptional cases, or incomplete data objects.These objects may confuse the analysis process, causing overtting of the data to the knowledge modelconstructed. As a result, the accuracy of the discovered patterns can be poor. Data cleaning methodsand data analysis methods which can handle outliers are required. While most methods discard outlierdata, such data may be of interest in itself such as in fraud detection for nding unusual usage of telecommunication services or credit cards. This form of data analysis is known as outlier mining. Pattern evaluation the interestingness problem.A data mining system can uncover thousands of patterns. Many of the patterns discovered may be uninteresting to the given user, representing common knowledge or lacking novelty. Several challenges remainregarding the development of techniques to assess the interestingness of discovered patterns, particularlywith regard to subjective measures which estimate the value of patterns with respect to a given user class,based on user beliefs or expectations. The use of interestingness measures to guide the discovery processand reduce the search space is another active area of research.2. Performance issues. These include eciency, scalability, and parallelization of data mining algorithms. Eciency and scalability of data mining algorithms.To eectively extract information from a huge amount of data in databases, data mining algorithms mustbe ecient and scalable. That is, the running time of a data mining algorithm must be predictable andacceptable in large databases. Algorithms with exponential or even mediumorder polynomial complexitywill not be of practical use. From a database perspective on knowledge discovery, eciency and scalabilityare key issues in the implementation of data mining systems. Many of the issues discussed above undermining methodology and userinteraction must also consider eciency and scalability. Parallel, distributed, and incremental updating algorithms.The huge size of many databases, the wide distribution of data, and the computational complexity ofsome data mining methods are factors motivating the development of parallel and distributed datamining algorithms. Such algorithms divide the data into partitions, which are processed in parallel.The results from the partitions are then merged. Moreover, the high cost of some data mining processespromotes the need for incremental data mining algorithms which incorporate database updates withouthaving to mine the entire data again from scratch. Such algorithms perform knowledge modicationincrementally to amend and strengthen what was previously discovered.3. Issues relating to the diversity of database types. Handling of relational and complex types of data.There are many kinds of data stored in databases and data warehouses. Can we expect that a singledata mining system can perform eective mining on all kinds of data Since relational databases and datawarehouses are widely used, the development of ecient and eective data mining systems for such data isimportant. However, other databases may contain complex data objects, hypertext and multimedia data,spatial data, temporal data, or transaction data. It is unrealistic to expect one system to mine all kindsof data due to the diversity of data types and dierent goals of data mining. Specic data mining systemsshould be constructed for mining specic kinds of data. Therefore, one may expect to have dierent datamining systems for dierent kinds of data. Mining information from heterogeneous databases and global information systems.Local and widearea computer networks such as the Internet connect many sources of data, forminghuge, distributed, and heterogeneous databases. The discovery of knowledge from dierent sources ofstructured, semistructured, or unstructured data with diverse data semantics poses great challengesto data mining. Data mining may help disclose highlevel data regularities in multiple heterogeneousdatabases that are unlikely to be discovered by simple query systems and may improve informationexchange and interoperability in heterogeneous databases.The above issues are considered major requirements and challenges for the further evolution of data miningtechnology. Some of the challenges have been addressed in recent data mining research and development, to a1.8. SUMMARY 21certain extent, and are now considered requirements, while others are still at the research stage. The issues, however,continue to stimulate further investigation and improvement. Additional issues relating to applications, privacy, andthe social impact of data mining are discussed in Chapter 10, the nal chapter of this book.1.8 Summary Database technology has evolved from primitive le processing to the development of database managementsystems with query and transaction processing. Further progress has led to the increasing demand for ecientand eective data analysis and data understanding tools. This need is a result of the explosive growth indata collected from applications including business and management, government administration, scienticand engineering, and environmental control. Data mining is the task of discovering interesting patterns from large amounts of data where the data canbe stored in databases, data warehouses, or other information repositories. It is a young interdisciplinary eld,drawing from areas such as database systems, data warehousing, statistics, machine learning, data visualization,information retrieval, and high performance computing. Other contributing areas include neural networks,pattern recognition, spatial data analysis, image databases, signal processing, and inductive logic programming. A knowledge discovery process includes data cleaning, data integration, data selection, data transformation,data mining, pattern evaluation, and knowledge presentation. Data patterns can be mined from many dierent kinds of databases, such as relational databases, datawarehouses, and transactional, objectrelational, and objectoriented databases. Interesting data patternscan also be extracted from other kinds of information repositories, including spatial, timerelated, text,multimedia, and legacy databases, and the WorldWide Web. A data warehouse is a repository for long term storage of data from multiple sources, organized so asto facilitate management decision making. The data are stored under a unied schema, and are typicallysummarized. Data warehouse systems provide some data analysis capabilities, collectively referred to as OLAPOnLine Analytical Processing. OLAP operations include drilldown, rollup, and pivot. Data mining functionalities include the discovery of conceptclass descriptions i.e., characterization anddiscrimination, association, classication, prediction, clustering, trend analysis, deviation analysis, and similarity analysis. Characterization and discrimination are forms of data summarization. A pattern represents knowledge if it is easily understood by humans, valid on test data with some degreeof certainty, potentially useful, novel, or validates a hunch about which the user was curious. Measures ofpattern interestingness, either objective or subjective, can be used to guide the discovery process. Data mining systems can be classied according to the kinds of databases mined, the kinds of knowledgemined, or the techniques used. Ecient and eective data mining in large databases poses numerous requirements and great challenges toresearchers and developers. The issues involved include data miningmethodology, userinteraction, performanceand scalability, and the processing of a large variety of data types. Other issues include the exploration of datamining applications, and their social impacts.Exercises1.
