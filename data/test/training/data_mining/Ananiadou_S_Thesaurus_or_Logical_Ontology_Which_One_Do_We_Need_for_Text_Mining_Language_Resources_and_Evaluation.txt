Ontologies are recognised as important tools not only for effective andefficient information sharing but also for information extraction and text mining. Inthe biomedical domain, the need of a common ontology for information sharing haslong been recognised and several ontologies are now widely used.However, there is confusion among researchers on the type of ontology it is neededfor text mining and how it can be used for effective knowledge management, sharingand integration in biomedicine.We argue in this paper that there are several different views of the definition ofontology and that, while the logical view is popular for some applications, it maybe neither possible nor necessary for text mining.We propose as an alternative to formal ontologies a textcentred approach forknowledge sharing. We argue that a thesaurus ie. an organised collection of termsenriched with relations is more useful for text mining applications than formalontologies.Keywords thesaurus, ontology, terminology, text mining1. BACKGROUNDThe currently dominant approach to knowledge sharing and integrationis the ontologycentred approach. Ontologies are conceptual modelswhich support consistent and unambiguous knowledge sharing and provide a framework for knowledge integration which ideally should beflexible, rigorous and consistent.By thesaurus in this paper we mean a terminological thesaurus asdistinct from a documentation thesaurus which is highly constrained asit typically has a narrow set of relationships broader term, narrowerterm and related term and a controlled vocabulary. A terminologicalc 2005 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.submit.tex 23022005 430 p.12 J.Tsujii and S.Ananiadouthesaurus consists of a wider set of relationships pertinent to a subjectdomain, linking the defined concepts of that domain with the termsthat realise them including their variant forms.While the ontologycentred approach has been successful in someapplications, in others it has encountered difficulties. While small ontologies can be built manually in a topdown manner, constructingcomprehensive ontologies for real applications is not a trivial task.Furthermore, in many fields of application, knowledge to be shared andintegrated is presented mostly in text. Due to the inherent properties ofhuman language, it is not straightforward to link knowledge in text withontologies, even if comprehensive ontologies will ever be constructed.More seriously, we suspect that in certain applications, such unambiguous and consistent conceptual models play a far less significant rolein sharing knowledge than the ontologycentred approach assumes. Insome cases, conceptual models across and within communities whichintend to share their knowledge are inherently more fragmented anddynamic and less consistent than the ontology approach assumes.In this paper, we propose a complementary approach, the textcentred approach, in which ontological commitment is kept to a minimum and, instead of using logical inferences for deriving implicit information, the emphasis is put on techniques of text mining and automaticknowledge acquisition for constructing ontologies from text.We concentrate on Biomedicine, since Biomedicine has the hallmarksof a domain for which the ontologycentred approach fails to delivereffective knowledge sharing systems.Knowledge sharing has become crucial in Biomedicine, because therecent developments in molecular biology has revealed that all creaturesshare, through history of evolution, common biological systems, i.e.geneprotein networks which are encoded in DNA sequences, and thatall biomedical phenomena e.g. diseases, immunologic reaction, etc.have their roots in these common biological systems. This implies thatthere is a high degree of interrelation between the areas of biology, medical and pharmaceutical sciences through such geneprotein networks,and thus knowledge in Biomedicine is highly interconnected.However, knowledge sharing in Biomedicine is not so straightforward. Firstly, knowledge to be shared is mostly presented in text, i.e.domain literature, and the amount of text to be shared is enormous.Although a great deal of crucial biomedical information is stored infactual databases, the most relevant and useful information is still represented in domain literature. Medline contains over 14 million records,extending its coverage by a large amount each month. Open accesspublishers such as BioMed Central have growing collections of full textscientific articles. There is increasing activity and interest in linkingsubmit.tex 23022005 430 p.2Thesaurus or logical ontology, which one do we need for text mining 3factual biodatabases to the literature, in using the literature to check,complete or complement the contents of such databases, however currently such curation is laborious, being done largely manually withfew sophisticated aids, thus the risks of introducing errors or leavingunsuspected gaps are nonnegligible.Secondly, since communities which intend to share their knowledgehave evolved independently of each other, they have their own vocabularies and language uses. The same proteins, for example, oftenhave different names in different communities. More seriously, whiledifferent fields are interested in common biological systems, they arenot exactly the same. Although similar proteins appear and may havesimilar functions in different species, their functions and properties arehighly dependent on the surrounding context and not exactly the same.Researchers who try to identify the function of a specific proteinin a specific biological context, may gather all relevant facts reportedin papers, including those on similar proteins. However, they do notassume that all reported facts in literature are valid for the protein inthe context at hand. Rather, they will examine biological contexts inliterature to choose a set of contexts similar to the one at hand and inferthe function of the protein by considering and weighing all potentialimplications and consequences of reported facts.Most of the widely used ontologies have been built on a topdownmanner.They are limited in their conceptual coverage and they aremainly oriented for human expert use. The difficulties and limitationslie with the definition of concepts classes, sets of instances since oneis expected to identify all instances of a concept. This task demandsevidence from text.Attempting to use ontologies to support knowledge managementtasks such as classification, clustering, summarisation, indexing, information extraction, text mining etc reported disappointing results. Oneof the main reasons for this is the failure to match instances termsfrom text to concept labels of ontologies. This is due to the inherentambiguous and diverse nature of language.Inferences and knowledgesharing in Biomedicine as such are verydifferent from those envisaged by the ontologycentred approach ingeneral and by formal ontologists in particular. They are more likeabduction based on similarities than logical deduction. Reflecting onthe nature of fragmented communities and the modes of inferences inBiomedicine, we argue in this paper that i terminological thesauriwhich maintain relationships among language uses in different communities are more important than logically consistent ontologies and iibioontologies such as the GO Gene Ontology which biologists havesubmit.tex 23022005 430 p.34 J.Tsujii and S.Ananiadoufound useful, though not completely satisfactory, are very different innature from ontologies which the ontologycentred approach envisages.2. Difficulties in the OntologyCentred ApproachWhenever different communities want to share knowledge, both terminological and ontological problems arise. Different communities mayuse different terms to denote the same concept and the same terms todenote different concepts terminological problems. It is also the casethat different communities view the same entities from different facetsand thus conceptualise them differently ontological problems.In some applications such as ebusiness, different communities canreach an explicit agreement on a standard ontology and a set of standard terms to denote concepts or entities in the ontology. However, in aconstantly evolving domain such as biomedicine we encounter the following crucial differences 1 Size of ontology 2 Context dependency3 Evolving nature of science 4 Hypothetical nature of ontology 5Inconsistency2.1. Size of OntologyThe number of concepts covering ontologies in areas such as ebusinessis more limited than in biomedicine. For example, the UMLS metathesaurus contains1 In total, as of July 2003,900,551 concepts 1,852,501 English strings2 For the tissues, organs, and body parts,81,435 concepts 177,540 English strings3 For the diseases and disorders,114,444 concepts 350,495 English stringsAlthough it may be possible to manage relationships for a smallnumber of concepts, the task becomes intractable for a large amountof concepts such as in the above. Despite a huge number of concepts inUMLS, many of the recognised concepts do not appear simply becauseavailable resources do not represent these types of entities e.g. termsthat refer to families or group of proteins Blaschke and Valencia, 2002.Equally seriously, termforms which actually appear in text are often notregistered in UMLS, since UMLS mainly focuses on conceptual information. This causes practical difficulties in sharing knowledge in text.In order to maintain such a large collection of concepts and termforms,one needs NLP tools to keep the collection uptodate in relation toactual running text.submit.tex 23022005 430 p.4Thesaurus or logical ontology, which one do we need for text mining 52.2. Context DependencyThe assumption in logical ontologies is that categories are explicitly defined by their defining properties and that, once an entity is judged as amember of a category, it inherits a set of other properties derived properties. The attraction of logical ontology comes from such inferencecapability that presupposes static, contextindependent relationshipsbetween categories and properties.However, such contextindependent relationships are not the normin biomedicine. Whether a protein contains certain properties or notdepends on factors such as its location inside a cell, the anatomicalposition of a cell, the states of other biochemical entities around it,etc., as well as the protein category to which it belongs.Context dependency is one of the hardest problems in logical modeling of everyday inferences in AI such as qualification, nonmonotonicity,which severely restrict the utility of logicallybased frameworks. Sincebiological entities and events portray a highdegree of contextdependencyas everyday inferences, deduction would hardly be effective in Biomedicineeither. It is also worthwhile to note that, because of contextdependency,bioscientists, even when they identify relevant events in curated databases, also consult original papers from scientific literature.2.3. The Evolving Nature of ScienceIf we compare diverse domains which ontologies are to model, we ascertain the following differences while domains such as those in ebusinessare well circumscribed and understood, domains such as Biomedicineare openended and only partial understandings exist. In the former,ontologies are introduced in order to make the shared understandingexplicit and thereby facilitate effective communication in business. Onthe other hand, ontologies in biology go beyond the level of effectivecommunication they are motivated by the need to fully understand andmodel the domain. One way of modeling or understanding a domain isthrough lexical means. That is, a new term is introduced to delineateknowledge about a concept which is considered to be useful or relevant,and to specify the properties or attributes characterising it Sager1990. In due course, new discoveries may change our understandingof the concept which the term denotes and subsequently change itsmeaning.It is common in Biomedicine that a term introduced is subsequentlyfound to denote several distinct concepts, thus raising a need to introduce new distinctive names. On the other hand, it is also very commonthat two distinct terms used in different communities are later foundto denote the same concept and merged into a single term.submit.tex 23022005 430 p.56 J.Tsujii and S.AnaniadouDue to the evolving nature of science, concepts often are not fullydelineated, since they are themselves evolving. This is reflected in thedegree of term variation observed in dynamic fields. Dynamically evolving fields, such as biomedicine, exhibit a high degree of term variationNenadic et al., 2005.2.4. The Hypothetical Nature of OntologyIn scientific fields, not only the individual terms but also whole ontological frameworks are hypothetical in nature. Let us take as an examplefrom anatomical ontologies.In the NCI thesaurus, anatomic structure, system, or substance isclassified into body cavity, body fluid or substance, body part, bodyregion, organ, organ system, microanatomy etc. Within Organ, breastis classified as bronchial tree and diaphragm and differentiated betweenmale and female breast.Such an anatomical classification is not a transcendental object, buthas been hypothesized, revised and established through the long historyof medical science. There were many other classification schemas, somewere based on functions of organs and others on their physical properties. For now, the NCI classification of human anatomy is, more orless, agreed upon by researchers, simply because the scheme is useful,more effective than other schemes, for explaining and understandingbiomedical phenomena in humans.In logical ontologies, classification schemas exist prior to a set oftheir logical consequences. On the contrary to this, in scientific ontologies a set of consequences phenomena to be explained preexistsand researchers try to find an ontology by which they can derive orexplain them in the most consistent manner. In other words, to buildproper ontologies is a crucial step of science which looks for consistentand elegant ways of explaining reality. As we will see in Section 42, bioontologies such as the GO show characteristics of this type ofontology.2.5. InconsistencyAs we discussed, deductive inferences based on formal consistent ontologies would be of limited use in Biomedicine. Closer examinations of theGene ontology, Ancal ontologies, etc. show that logical inconsistency isabundant and that they are closer to UDC, a multilingual classificationscheme, rather than a logical ontology. While researchers with formalorientation describe inconsistencies in biomedical ontologies as shortcomings, their criticisms are misplaced due to their misunderstandingof the nature of bioontologies, as pointed out by Ceusters et al.2003.submit.tex 23022005 430 p.6Thesaurus or logical ontology, which one do we need for text mining 73. Towards a TextCentred ApproachAs we have already mentioned, a complete and contextindependentontology is an unattainable goal in biomedicine. In the textcentredapproach we take the position that most relationships among conceptsas well as the concepts themselves remain implicit in text, waiting tobe discovered. Thus, text mining and NLP techniques play a more important role in uncovering hidden and implicit information than logicaldeduction. This approach does not exclude the complementary use ofexplicit partial ontologies. Instead of explicit definitions, we assumethat all term occurrences in text implicitly define the semantics ofconcepts. In addition by mining term associations, relationships amongconcepts are discovered.3.1. The non trivial mapping between terms and conceptsAs we have already reported , even within the same text, a term cantake different forms. A term may be expressed via various mechanismsincluding orthographic variation usage of hyphens and slashes aminoacid and aminoacid, lower and upper cases NFKB and NFkb,spelling variations tumour and tumor, various LatinGreek transcriptions oestrogen and estrogen and abbreviations RAR and retinoicacid receptor. Further complexity is introduced as authors vary theforms they use in different ways e.g. different reductions thyroid hormone receptor and thyroid receptor, or the SB2 gene and SB2 or useembedded variant forms within larger forms CREBbinding protein,where CREB is in turn cAMPresponse elementbinding protein. Thisrich variety of termforms for each term is a stumbling block especiallyfor language processing, as these forms have to be recognised, linkedand mapped to terminological and ontological resources. It also causesproblems to the human in cases where there is room for ambiguity orwhere some termform has never been seen before and its provenancerelationship to its term is unclear.Several approaches have been suggested to automatically integrateand map between resources e.g. between GO and UMLS using exactstring matching Cantor et al, 2003, Sarkar et al., 2003. Resultsrevealed the difficulties inherent in the integration of biological terminologies, mainly in terms of extensive variability of lexical termrepresentations, and the problem of term ambiguity with respect tomapping into a data source. For example, attempts to integrate genenames in UMLS were not successful since they increased ambiguity,and disambiguation information particularly important for systematicpolysemy was not available in lexical resources examined.submit.tex 23022005 430 p.78 J.Tsujii and S.AnaniadouIn order to map successfully termforms in text to ontological concepts we have to deal with language variability. Several techniquesdealing with term variation have been suggested.Jacquemin and Tzoukermann conflate multiword terms by combining stemming and terminological lookup. Stemming was used toreduce words so that conceptually and linguistically related words werenormalised to the same stem thus resolving some orthographic andmorphological variations, while a terminological thesaurus might beused for spotting synonyms and linking lexical variants.Nenadic et al. 2005 incorporate different types of term variation intoa base line method of automatic term recognition, the CNC valueFrantzi et al., 2000. The incorporation of treatment of term variationenhanced the performance of the ATR system where linking relatedoccurrences is vital for successful terminology management.Another approach to the recognition of term variants uses approximate string matching techniques to link or generate different termvariants Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2003.3.2. ThesauriFor biologists it is common to use two different names, e.g. PKB andAkt to denote the same protein. Taking into account the amount of newterms added daily in the field compounded by the high degree of termvariability, it is not surprising that term synonyms are not recognised.Lexical variability is an important aspect of scientific communicationand language use among different groups. Lexical variants and synonyms coexist with standardised terms. Synonymy relationships areoften mentionned as comments in data base entries e.g. This proteinis similar to ProteinB. Typically, these relationships remain hiddenin the databases but are nevertheless significant for inferencing and biotext mining and as such they should be made explicit in any knowledgesharing system.An example of a textcentred approach is the GENIA thesauruswhich keeps track of such relationships. We assume that since the meanings of terms are only implicitly defined by all their occurrences in text,many of the relationships such as synonymy, hyponymy, meronymy etcare not further delineated. In order to make use of this hidden information existing in various heterogeneous resources we use an integratedterminological management system, TIMS, Mima et al. 2002. TIMSTagged Information Management System links term entries of thethesaurus with their occurrences in actual text, other surface termssuch as synonyms, related terms such as homologues, orthologues andtheir ID record from various biodatabases.submit.tex 23022005 430 p.8Thesaurus or logical ontology, which one do we need for text mining 93.3. Thesauri and KnowledgeIdeally, terms are monoreferential, ie. a term coincides to a concept.In reality, this is more of an exception than the norm. Let us observethe following examples from biomedicine Cyclinedependent kinase inhibitor was first introduced to represent a protein family with onlyone extention, p27. However, cyclinedependent kinase inhibitor is usedinterchangeably with p27 or p27kip1, as the name of the individualprotein and not as the name of the protein family Morgan 2003. Inthe case of NFKB2, the term is used to denote the name of a family oftwo individual proteins with separate ids in SwissProt. These proteinsare homologues belonging to different species, human and chicken.The above examples demonstrate that it is rather difficult to establish equivalences between term forms and concepts. In effect, manyproteins have dual names to also denote the protein family they belongto. MAP kinase is a family name including more than 40 individualproteins and because of the number of individual proteins in the family,it is never used as the name of individual proteins.Since surface textual cues cannot distinguish between a genuine family name from individual protein names derived from family names, thethesaurus should include relationships of term forms with their actualdenotations, i.e. ids in various data bases.A thesaurus links surface terms with data base ids and other typesof information in diverse data bases of proteins SwissProt, genes LocusLink, pathwaysKEGG, TRANSFAC, etc. However, it is worthnoting that a thesaurus does not presuppose a single, logically consistent ontology.3.4. Minimum Ontology and Ambiguous TermsIn order for a thesaurus to be useful, it should maintain not only relationships among surface forms but should be able to deal with termambiguity.Gene names are often used to denote gene products proteins thatthey encode. Although there are many definitions of the term gene,it is nevertheless obvious that there are two distinct classes of entities,genes and proteins. A term like suppressor of sable is used ambiguouslyto refer to either one of these two classes genes and proteins which areontologically very different. While domains are part of proteins, namesof domains are sometimes used as the names of proteins that containthem as part.It is important to note that, without commitment to the ontologicaldistinction between gene and protein or domain and protein, we couldnot capture even such an obvious ambiguity. We need therefore an onsubmit.tex 23022005 430 p.910 J.Tsujii and S.Ananiadoutology which can represent and include term ambiguity we call such anontology a minimum ontology. The minimum ontology is linguisticallymotivated and acts as an interface to more detailed bioontologies. Anexample of a minimum ontology is GENIA Ohta et al., 2002 whichconsists of 36 ontological classes. These classes are equivalent to theclasses of named entity recognisers based on linguistic cues. Referentialdistinctions such as homologues, orthologues etc are not part of theminimum ontology.4. The Nature of Inferences and BioOntologiesIn formal ontologies, there is emphasis on the soundness and completeness of the underlying deductive inference mechanism. In biology thenature of inferencing mechanism is different as more emphasis is givento the ability to make new plausible hypotheses.4.1. An example of inferencing from biologyIn order to illustrate our point about the nature of inferencing inbiology, let us consider the following example.1 Results from a biological experiment microarray data showedthat three proteins, FLJ23251, BM002 and CGI126, interacted witheach other, and that this interaction was peculiar to patients with aspecific disease. Based on these results, further information was neededto understand the mechanisms of the interaction.2 A comment from a biodatabase recorded that this protein ZK652.3  is similar to human bone marrow protein BM002 inthe entry of ZK652.3. Further literature search, retrieved a paper onZK652.3 with the statement that ZK652.3 has ubiquitinlike fold. Fromthese two pieces of information, the biologist hypothesized that BM002is actually ubiquitin and that the whole process is of ubiquitination atype of protein degradation process.3 In another scientific paper we found that FLJ23251 has ubiquitinactivating enzyme E1domain. This strengthened the hypothesis in step2.4 Since the process of ubiquitination often involves another twoenzymes, E2 or E3, we can hypothesize that CGI126 would be eitherone of these two enzymes. From this hypothesis we can then look forfurther information of CGI126.The key to the whole process is Step 2, where two uncertain andvague statements are combined to form a hypothesis. This step is abductive in nature, and the subsequent steps help us to improve thesubmit.tex 23022005 430 p.10Thesaurus or logical ontology, which one do we need for text mining 11plausibility of the hypothesis by gathering further evidence. Unlike inthe process of deduction, as long as further evidence may improve theplausibility of an hypothesis, the hypothesis is not logically implied.Either the hypothesis would become plausible enough to be believed orit should to be validated by biological experimentation.An additional point is that in step 2 we use a vague relationship ofbeingsimilarto and that this similarity does not logically imply thatBM002 has also ubiquitinlike fold. It only suggests that it is plausibleto assume so.Other relationships in biology such as homologues and orthologuesare used in the same way as beingsimilarto. They imply that part ofthe DNA sequences in different spieces are so similar that they are considered to be preserved across species through the history of evolution.It practical terms the implication is that two genes and their products proteins are likely to share common functional roles in similarnetworks in different spieces. Orthologues are most likely to share thesame properties, while just similar proteins share the least properties.Such quantitative nature of inferences is a hallmark of abduction, and isbeing modeled, not by logical frameworks, but by models such Bayesiannetworks, etc.4.2. Bioontology  the GOThe crucial step in abduction is making plausible hypotheses basedon evidences. This step should involve biologists who have to searchthrough a huge space of possibilities. In order to help biologists togather evidence from large scale knowledge bases to form plausiblehypotheses, classifications ie classifying functions and processes andrelating them to proteins and genes andor ontologies are needed.This is where the power of text mining can help it can play a majorrole in the abductive process.The Gene Ontology GO, one of the most widely used bioontologies,aims to attain the same target as the text mining in the above. Thatis, by establishing an explicit classification schema, it intends to helpbiologists to gather facts on proteins which appear in similar biologicalcontexts. As for such classification of biological contexts, the GO hasthree schemes, 1 cellular components the location inside cells whereproteins appear, 2 molecular functions and 3 biological processes.Under these three headings, the GO has a set of controlled vocabularycontaining around 17,000 terms. Whether the GO is useful or not isjudged by how effective the classification schemes are to retrieve relevant proteins in similar biological contexts, relevant for identificationof unknown functions of a protein in a given biological context. Assubmit.tex 23022005 430 p.1112 J.Tsujii and S.Ananiadouwith anatomical ontologies, the whole classification scheme is based onhypotheses that factors chosen for classification are relevant to the taskat hand.It has also been suggested that the GO classes can be used asevidence in abductive reasoning. Thus, we can rank the plausibilityof interactions of proteins by assuming that proteins reported to be insimilar processes with similar roles and exist in similar locations aremore likely to interact with each other.5. Concluding RemarksWe have described a text centred approach to knowledge mining fromlarge repositories of biomedical literature. One of the most importantadvantages of this approach is that it is datadriven, as the terminological information is collected dynamically from corpora. This isparticularly important for domains such as biomedicine, as there is typically a gap between terms used in corpora and controlled vocabularies.If we take into account the pace of creating new terms, standardisationissues will still be a problem in the near future. Thus, the aim of atext centred approach to knowledge management is to provide toolsto bridge that gap and facilitate effective mining and integration ofscientific literature, experimental data, ontologies and databases.Our system TIMS explores similar ideas such as that a major sourceof knowledge comes from text from which we derive information andthat terms instances in text play a crucial role in the integration ofknowledge sources, instead of a common ontology.In TIMS, a set of operations on segments of text similar to those ofRegional Algebra was the core for retrieving and deriving informationfrom text. While such operations still play a central role, we plan tointegrate them with more quantitative methods and with other textmining techniques.We also plan to extend the linguistic units for integrating knowledgesources from simple terms to complex expressions of events. Eventswhich are identified and extracted by information extraction techniquesare to be annotated in text and used as units for accessing variousknowledge sources. This method will make the links between recordsin curated data bases and relevant portions of text much clearer andwill satisfy the users demands to access and read original papers oncerelevant curated facts are located.It is also a crucial step to integrate our work with the ontologycentred approach. One possible extention is to use our system to populate incomplete, existing ontologies. Classification of terms is essentialsubmit.tex 23022005 430 p.12Thesaurus or logical ontology, which one do we need for text mining 13for mapping to referent databases and knowledge integration.
