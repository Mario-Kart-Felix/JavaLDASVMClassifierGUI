The primary goals of this group are the analysis, synthesis, understanding, and manipulation of visual data such as images, video sequences, and 3D geometric content. Application areas span a broad range from entertainment to surveillance. The group is actively engaged in image and video editing and enhancement, special effects, 3D interactive content generation, sensor calibration, pattern recognition and object recognition. This research cluster includes the researchers from the Graphics & Image Technologies Laboratory as well as overlapping with researchers in the Learning and Adaptive Systems cluster.

The lab currently consists of several high-end dual processor workstations with state-of-the-art 3D graphics acceleration hardware as well as disk arrays for efficient storage and access of video sequences. The lab is also equipped with cameras and display devices to support computer vision and projection display. The lab provides researchers with hardware and software to make progress in research areas including image and video editing and enhancement, special effects, 3D interactive interfaces, character animation, and 3D geometry representation. Research Partners       Projects Video Painting with Space-Time-Varying Style Parameters ( Todorovic , Zhang ) Video painting system that accounts for the spatial support of objects in the images or video, and uses this information to specify style parameters and stroke orientation for painterly rendering. Object-based painterly rendering approach is characterized by style parameters that coherently vary in space and time. Spatiotemporal coherence of varying style parameters enables more artistic freedom. Texel-based Texture Segmentation ( Todorovic ) No assumptions about the pdf of texel properties. Both appearance and placement of the texels are allowed to be stochastic and correlated. New hierarchical, adaptive-bandwidth kernel to capture texel structural properties.
