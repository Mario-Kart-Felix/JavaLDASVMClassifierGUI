Communication expedited leads to ansubstantial improvement of quality and productivity in the AEC industry. The research introducesthe application of computer graphics animation as a tool for the computer integrated construction,evaluates the role and proposes recommendations for the application. In order to verify theeffectiveness of the application, a case study was performed in a highway reconstruction projectcurrently carried out in Kobe, Japan, where much of its infrastructure suffered from severedamages due to the Great Hanshin Earthquake in 1995. The study showed its superiority as acommunication tool to common paperonly tool.1 Chief Civil Engineer2 Deputy Project Manager3 Professor4 Associate ProfessorINTRODUCTION    A great earthquake, the Great Hanshin Earthquake, hit Kobe area and damaged much of itsinfrastructure in January, 1995. Some elevated highwaybridge girders fell down. Some piersshows fatal clacks. Some piers leaned. Most of the damaged structures had to be repaired or evenbe completely reconstructed.    A route of elevated doubledeck bypass road bridges for Route 2, Hamate Bypass, is one ofthe vital national arteries, which passes through the middle of the city of Kobe known as aninternational seaport. The bridges suffered from severe damages in their piers and girders. Someof them had to be reconstructed and aseismically reinforced. To date in February, 1996, the arteryis still out of service. Engineers in the government, contractors and regulatory services have beenworking very hard to let the artery be in service as early as possible.    A section of the artery reconstruction projects, HamabeDori sectionFigure 1, is locatedright in the middle of the cross section among the elevated highway, Hanshin Expressway,elevated railroad, Port Liner, and the artery, where the traffic beneath these structures is verybusy. All of the structures had to be reconstructed or repaired as soon as possible in the sameperiod. Collaborative work environment was essential to the quick recovery.Figure 1  Aerial View of HamabeDori Section All Girders Removed    Computer graphics animation has been implemented to the reconstruction in order tominimize conflicts among the projects in the same area and expect the support of general publicby promoting the importance and sequences of the project.COMPUTER GRAPHICS ANIMATION    Computer graphics animation is categorized in two basic functionality. Those are realtimeanimation and frame accurate framebyframe animation. A difference exists in how animationshould be applied to solve a specific problem.    Realtime animation is dynamic and interactive. Interaction requires significant graphicsprocessing power. Realtime animation is created by complex four step process. First, threedimensional models are created using either external CAD software or a similar aspect of theanimation software. These models are then loaded into the animation system. Second, a usersupplies a realtime animation controls parameters such as camera position, view parameters suchas perspective angles, and object positions in the model. Third, the objects and the camera aremoved based on the input provided by the user. The fourth stage is the rendering stage. The mostimportant feature of realtime animation is the ability to provide complete, interactive controlover the motion of the objects and the camera. The size and complexity of the model and thepower of the graphics hardware influence performance.    Unlike realtime animation, frameaccurate framebyframe recording animation is notinteractive. This method is less effective for interactive applications such as design review andconstruction simulation. Since the rendering time is no longer dependent on an interactivebottleneck, more sophisticated rendering techniques such as multiple reflections and shadows canbe used. The process of frame accurate animation is similar in many ways to realtime animation.As in realtime animation, the creation of threedimensional objects is the first step. The motionof the objects and the camera in a key frame is saved in a script file. The system then renders thescene. Once the rendering process is complete, the scene is recorded on videotape or digitalmedia. Once a scene is rendered and recorded, the system moves to the next frame. This processrepeats until the objects and camera motions defined by the motion script file are completed.COMPUTER INTEGRATED CONSTRUCTION    CIC is based on the ideas of computer integrated manufacturing CIM adopted from themanufacturing industry. CIC is a strategy that links technology with people to help managevarious activities in architecture, engineering and construction AEC firms. CIC facilitatessynergy among technologies available in the AEC industry by optimizing management,construction and facility management.    Successful implementation of CIC requires the following considerations. CIC depends on1 cooperative business relationships as opposed to competitive ones 2 integrated computersystems that allow concurrent design and construction as well as sufficient field access 3 abilityto provide both owner and operator with information required for operations and maintenance4 ability to communicate electronically with major project participants such as clients, vendorsand subcontractors.    The goal of CIC is the vertical integration of data, design decisions and knowledge throughall phases of a construction project in order to improve the productivity and quality of design andconstruction. In this way, constructed facilities can better meet the cost, schedule and technicalperformance objectives of their owners. Moreover, enhanced integration and automation of thedecisionmaking process in all phases of the project can provide a machinereadable andmachineusable knowledge environment in which computerization of the constructionmanagement processes can be accomplished more efficiently.    Among the technologies for CIC, computeraided design CAD systems perform a varietyof design, engineering and managerial tasks. In addition, computer graphics animation is nowseen as an emerging technology in the AEC industry.APPLICATION FOR AEC INDUSTRY    Most personal computers available today offer enormous power and speed which onlyexpensive mainframe computers were capable of several years ago. In the AEC industry, personalcomputers have become capable of using new and emerging computer technologies such ascomputer graphics animation. Expensive mainframe computers are no longer required for suchapplications.    The AEC industry can improve efficiency and gain benefits resulting from the use of thecomputer graphics animation systems. Communication among participants can greatly improvethe construction process. Computer graphics animation can play a key role in this process.However, as construction projects become more complicated and more technologies becomeavailable, efficient communication becomes essential. The ability to quickly and accuratelyconvey the physical configuration of a construction project is desired. Computer graphicsanimation allows construction project participants to exchange ideas and allows them to interactwith threedimensional geometry without any ambiguities or misunderstandings. Animatedimages require less interpretation than static images or drawings.    Application of computer graphics animation for AEC industry provides strategic andoperational advantages 1 the ability to quickly and effectively present concepts in a form whichresembles physical and real images allows designers to identify an owners needs and to providesolutions to these needs 2 the ability to directly and interactively develop a program ofconceptual design for a client on the computer screen with threedimensional animated images3 the capability for training and rehearsing complex construction operations to help manageconstruction safety and 4 the ability to disseminate newly developed inhouse technologies toprospective owners with wide range of technical background, allowing them to consider thetechnologies for their new facilities. These advantages provide a strategic benefit and anincreased edge over competitors. A firms improved image as a clientoriented, advancedtechnology company catches the eye of a prospective owner and could thereby increase itsmarket share.    In addition to the image advantages, productivity improvement can be expected by 1 theability to construct a project and detect obscure flaws on the computer screen before actual fieldconstruction 2 the ability to involve more people from design, management, construction,operations and maintenance during the detailed design phase for exploring options that mightlead to design improvement 3 the ability to create an instant snapshot of the current state of thedesign, which does not suffer from construction delays associated with plastic models and 4 theability to facilitate immediate and unambiguous communication of the spatial relationships amongall design objects within the facility for better installation sequencing.CASE STUDY IN HIGHWAY RECONSTRUCTION    As stated in the previous section of the paper, the reconstruction site is located in thedifficult condition. Not only collaboration among the project participants is required, butcooperation of general public is essential to the successful completion of this fasttrackreconstruction project. In this regard, some specific applications could be applied and theirapplicability was studied.    Contractors of the project jointly set up an information booth to familiarize residents andothers with the project. It is to provide people with general information about the AEC industryas well as reconstruction methods chosen and reconstruction sequences and status. Computergraphics animation about the reconstruction process, such as removal and reinstallation ofdamaged girders and piersFigure 2, has been displayed on a personal computer at the booth andis regarded as an exciting and effective guidance.Figure 2  Animation Scenes of Demolishing Process of Damaged Bridge Pier    On the other hand, computer graphics animation has been used in a bridge girder removalprocess, where three huge trackcranes 360 ton lift capacity were required, to check clearancesand interference between giant cranes and bridges prior to actual construction.Figure 3, 4 and 5The animation worked, showing onsite engineers its removal process on the computer screen.

The inconsistent use of threedimensional design data at the design stage can be fatal to the use of computer graphics animationat the construction stage of a project. Cost associated with system implementation is alsoregarded as an obstacle. Using computer graphics animation for construction management is stillconsidered an expensive option.    Visualizing demolition sequences with computer graphics animation has been performed andevaluated through the case study. It improved coordination and communication betweendesignclient and construction and organizations. During the design and construction stage, itcould be used to evaluate the constructibility of a number of bridgedemolition processes on thecomputer screen by actually performing construction simulations and by graphically displayingwork status and physical interference at any given time. In this way, all construction participantscan understand each other and work as a team beyond their specific interests.    Animating and visualizing the highway reconstruction sequences and methods with a widelyfamiliarized personal computer at the information booth caught the eyes of participants of theproject and people who live near by the construction site. It has successfully improved publicrecognition of the activity of the AEC industry.REFERENCESNakaue, Asao 1995, Steel Garder Removal in HamabeDori Section of Hamate By    pass in Japanese, Doboku Sekou, Sankaidou, 3613, 2531Yoshihiko Fukuchi 1994, Animation for Computer Integrated Construction, Thesis    for Master of Science, MIT
