and verified by experiment involves quantum field theories. All particles are excitations of some field. Theseparticles are pointlike and they interact locally with other particles. Even thoughquantum field theories describe nature at the distance scales we observe, there arestrong indications that new elements will be involved at very short distances or veryhigh energies, distances of the order of the Planck scale. The reason is that at thosedistances or energies quantum gravity effects become important. It has not beenpossible to quantize gravity following the usual perturbative methods. Nevertheless,one can incorporate quantum gravity in a consistent quantum theory by giving up thenotion that particles are pointlike and assuming that the fundamental objects in thetheory are strings, namely onedimensional extended objects 1, 2. These strings canoscillate, and there is a spectrum of energies, or masses, for these oscillating strings.The oscillating strings look like localized, particlelike excitations to a low energy observer. So, a single oscillating string can effectively give rise to many types of particles,depending on its state of oscillation. All string theories include a particle with zeromass and spin two. Strings can interact by splitting and joining interactions. The onlyconsistent interaction for massless spin two particles is that of gravity. Therefore, anystring theory will contain gravity. The structure of string theory is highly constrained.String theories do not make sense in an arbitrary number of dimensions or on anyarbitrary geometry. Flat space string theory exists at least in perturbation theoryonly in ten dimensions. Actually, 10dimensional string theory is described by a stringwhich also has fermionic excitations and gives rise to a supersymmetric theory.1 Stringtheory is then a candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. One can get down to four1One could consider a string with no fermionic excitations, the so called bosonic string. It livesin 26 dimensions and contains tachyons, signaling an instability of the theory.4dimensions by considering string theory on R4M6 where M6 is some six dimensionalcompact manifold. Then, low energy interactions are determined by the geometry ofM6.Even though this is the motivation usually given for string theory nowadays, it isnot how string theory was originally discovered. String theory was discovered in anattempt to describe the large number of mesons and hadrons that were experimentallydiscovered in the 1960s. The idea was to view all these particles as different oscillationmodes of a string. The string idea described well some features of the hadron spectrum.For example, the mass of the lightest hadron with a given spin obeys a relation likem2  TJ2  const. This is explained simply by assuming that the mass and angularmomentum come from a rotating, relativistic string of tension T . It was later discoveredthat hadrons and mesons are actually made of quarks and that they are described byQCD.QCD is a gauge theory based on the group SU3. This is sometimes stated by sayingthat quarks have three colors. QCD is asymptotically free, meaning that the effectivecoupling constant decreases as the energy increases. At low energies QCD becomesstrongly coupled and it is not easy to perform calculations. One possible approachis to use numerical simulations on the lattice. This is at present the best availabletool to do calculations in QCD at low energies. It was suggested by t Hooft that thetheory might simplify when the number of colors N is large 3. The hope was that onecould solve exactly the theory with N  , and then one could do an expansion in1N  13. Furthermore, as explained in the next section, the diagrammatic expansionof the field theory suggests that the large N theory is a free string theory and thatthe string coupling constant is 1N . If the case with N  3 is similar to the casewith N   then this explains why the string model gave the correct relation betweenthe mass and the angular momentum. In this way the large N limit connects gaugetheories with string theories. The t Hooft argument, reviewed below, is very general,so it suggests that different kinds of gauge theories will correspond to different stringtheories. In this review we will study this correspondence between string theories andthe large N limit of field theories. We will see that the strings arising in the large Nlimit of field theories are the same as the strings describing quantum gravity. Namely,string theory in some backgrounds, including quantum gravity, is equivalent dual toa field theory.We said above that strings are not consistent in four flat dimensions. Indeed, if onewants to quantize a four dimensional string theory an anomaly appears that forces theintroduction of an extra field, sometimes called the Liouville field 4. This field onthe string worldsheet may be interpreted as an extra dimension, so that the stringseffectively move in five dimensions. One might qualitatively think of this new field asthe thickness of the string. If this is the case, why do we say that the string moves5in five dimensions The reason is that, like any string theory, this theory will containgravity, and the gravitational theory will live in as many dimensions as the number offields we have on the string. It is crucial then that the five dimensional geometry iscurved, so that it can correspond to a four dimensional field theory, as described indetail below.The argument that gauge theories are related to string theories in the large N limitis very general and is valid for basically any gauge theory. In particular we couldconsider a gauge theory where the coupling does not run as a function of the energyscale. Then, the theory is conformally invariant. It is quite hard to find quantum fieldtheories that are conformally invariant. In supersymmetric theories it is sometimespossible to prove exact conformal invariance. A simple example, which will be themain example in this review, is the supersymmetric SUN or UN gauge theory infour dimensions with four spinor supercharges N  4. Four is the maximal possiblenumber of supercharges for a field theory in four dimensions. Besides the gauge fieldsgluons this theory contains also four fermions and six scalar fields in the adjointrepresentation of the gauge group. The Lagrangian of such theories is completelydetermined by supersymmetry. There is a global SU4 Rsymmetry that rotates thesix scalar fields and the four fermions. The conformal group in four dimensions isSO4, 2, including the usual Poincare transformations as well as scale transformationsand special conformal transformations which include the inversion symmetry x xx2. These symmetries of the field theory should be reflected in the dual stringtheory. The simplest way for this to happen is if the five dimensional geometry has thesesymmetries. Locally there is only one space with SO4, 2 isometries five dimensionalAntideSitter space, or AdS5. Antide Sitter space is the maximally symmetric solutionof Einsteins equations with a negative cosmological constant. In this supersymmetriccase we expect the strings to also be supersymmetric. We said that superstrings movein ten dimensions. Now that we have added one more dimension it is not surprising anymore to add five more to get to a ten dimensional space. Since the gauge theory hasan SU4  SO6 global symmetry it is rather natural that the extra five dimensionalspace should be a five sphere, S5. So, we conclude that N  4 UN YangMills theorycould be the same as ten dimensional superstring theory on AdS5  S5 5. Here wehave presented a very heuristic argument for this equivalence later we will be moreprecise and give more evidence for this correspondence.The relationship we described between gauge theories and string theory on AntideSitter spaces was motivated by studies of Dbranes and black holes in strings theory.Dbranes are solitons in string theory 6. They come in various dimensionalities. Ifthey have zero spatial dimensions they are like ordinary localized, particletype solitonsolutions, analogous to the t HooftPolyakov 7, 8 monopole in gauge theories. Theseare called Dzerobranes. If they have one extended dimension they are called Done6branes or Dstrings. They are much heavier than ordinary fundamental strings whenthe string coupling is small. In fact, the tension of all Dbranes is proportional to 1gs,where gs is the string coupling constant. Dbranes are defined in string perturbationtheory in a very simple way they are surfaces where open strings can end. Theseopen strings have some massless modes, which describe the oscillations of the branes,a gauge field living on the brane, and their fermionic partners. If we have N coincidentbranes the open strings can start and end on different branes, so they carry two indicesthat run from one to N . This in turn implies that the low energy dynamics is describedby a UN gauge theory. Dpbranes are charged under p  1form gauge potentials,in the same way that a 0brane particle can be charged under a oneform gaugepotential as in electromagnetism. These p1form gauge potentials have p2formfield strengths, and they are part of the massless closed string modes, which belong tothe supergravity SUGRA multiplet containing the massless fields in flat space stringtheory before we put in any Dbranes. If we now add Dbranes they generate a flux ofthe corresponding field strength, and this flux in turn contributes to the stress energytensor so the geometry becomes curved. Indeed it is possible to find solutions of thesupergravity equations carrying these fluxes. Supergravity is the lowenergy limit ofstring theory, and it is believed that these solutions may be extended to solutions ofthe full string theory. These solutions are very similar to extremal charged black holesolutions in general relativity, except that in this case they are black branes with pextended spatial dimensions. Like black holes they contain event horizons.If we consider a set of N coincident D3branes the near horizon geometry turns outto be AdS5S5. On the other hand, the low energy dynamics on their worldvolume isgoverned by a UN gauge theory withN  4 supersymmetry 9. These two pictures ofDbranes are perturbatively valid for different regimes in the space of possible couplingconstants. Perturbative field theory is valid when gsN is small, while the lowenergygravitational description is perturbatively valid when the radius of curvature is muchlarger than the string scale, which turns out to imply that gsN should be very large. Asan object is brought closer and closer to the black brane horizon its energy measuredby an outside observer is redshifted, due to the large gravitational potential, and theenergy seems to be very small. On the other hand low energy excitations on thebranes are governed by the YangMills theory. So, it becomes natural to conjecturethat YangMills theory at strong coupling is describing the near horizon region ofthe black brane, whose geometry is AdS5  S5. The first indications that this is thecase came from calculations of low energy graviton absorption cross sections 10, 11,12. It was noticed there that the calculation done using gravity and the calculationdone using super YangMills theory agreed. These calculations, in turn, were inspiredby similar calculations for coincident D1D5 branes. In this case the near horizongeometry involves AdS3  S3 and the low energy field theory living on the Dbranes7is a 11 dimensional conformal field theory. In this D1D5 case there were numerouscalculations that agreed between the field theory and gravity. First black hole entropyfor extremal black holes was calculated in terms of the field theory in 13, and thenagreement was shown for near extremal black holes 14, 15 and for absorption crosssections 16, 17, 18. More generally, we will see that correlation functions in the gaugetheory can be calculated using the string theory or gravity for large gsN description,by considering the propagation of particles between different points in the boundaryof AdS, the points where operators are inserted 19, 20.Supergravities on AdS spaces were studied very extensively, see 21, 22 for reviews.See also 23, 24 for earlier hints of the correspondence.One of the main points of this review will be that the strings coming from gaugetheories are very much like the ordinary superstrings that have been studied during thelast 20 years. The only particular feature is that they are moving on a curved geometryantide Sitter space which has a boundary at spatial infinity. The boundary is at aninfinite spatial distance, but a light ray can go to the boundary and come back in finitetime. Massive particles can never get to the boundary. The radius of curvature ofAntide Sitter space depends on N so that large N corresponds to a large radius ofcurvature. Thus, by taking N to be large we can make the curvature as small as wewant. The theory in AdS includes gravity, since any string theory includes gravity. Soin the end we claim that there is an equivalence between a gravitational theory and afield theory. However, the mapping between the gravitational and field theory degreesof freedom is quite nontrivial since the field theory lives in a lower dimension. In somesense the field theory or at least the set of local observables in the field theory liveson the boundary of spacetime. One could argue that in general any quantum gravitytheory in AdS defines a conformal field theory CFT on the boundary. In somesense the situation is similar to the correspondence between three dimensional ChernSimons theory and a WZW model on the boundary 25. This is a topological theory inthree dimensions that induces a normal nontopological field theory on the boundary.A theory which includes gravity is in some sense topological since one is integratingover all metrics and therefore the theory does not depend on the metric. Similarly,in a quantum gravity theory we do not have any local observables. Notice that whenwe say that the theory includes gravity on AdS we are considering any finite energyexcitation, even black holes in AdS. So this is really a sum over all spacetimes that areasymptotic to AdS at the boundary. This is analogous to the usual flat space discussionof quantum gravity, where asymptotic flatness is required, but the spacetime could haveany topology as long as it is asymptotically flat. The asymptotically AdS case as wellas the asymptotically flat cases are special in the sense that one can choose a naturaltime and an associated Hamiltonian to define the quantum theory. Since black holesmight be present this time coordinate is not necessarily globally welldefined, but it is8certainly welldefined at infinity. If we assume that the conjecture we made above isvalid, then the UN YangMills theory gives a nonperturbative definition of stringtheory on AdS. And, by taking the limit N  , we can extract the ten dimensionalstring theory flat space physics, a procedure which is in principle but not in detailsimilar to the one used in matrix theory 26.The fact that the field theory lives in a lower dimensional space blends in perfectlywith some previous speculations about quantum gravity. It was suggested 27, 28that quantum gravity theories should be holographic, in the sense that physics in someregion can be described by a theory at the boundary with no more than one degree offreedom per Planck area. This holographic principle comes from thinking about theBekenstein bound which states that the maximum amount of entropy in some regionis given by the area of the region in Planck units 29. The reason for this bound isthat otherwise black hole formation could violate the second law of thermodynamics.We will see that the correspondence between field theories and string theory on AdSspace including gravity is a concrete realization of this holographic principle.The review is organized as follows.In the rest of the introductory chapter, we present background material. In section1.2, we present the t Hooft large N limit and its indication that gauge theories maybe dual to string theories. In section 1.3, we review the pbrane supergravity solutions.We discuss Dbranes, their worldvolume theory and their relation to the pbranes. Wediscuss greybody factors and their calculation for black holes built out of Dbranes.In chapter 2, we review conformal field theories and AdS spaces. In section 2.1, wegive a brief description of conformal field theories. In section 2.2, we summarize thegeometry of AdS spaces and gauged supergravities.In chapter 3, we derive the correspondence between supersymmetric Yang Millstheory and string theory on AdS5  S5 from the physics of D3branes in string theory. We define, in section 3.1, the correspondence between fields in the string theoryand operators of the conformal field theory and the prescription for the computationof correlation functions. We also point out that the correspondence gives an explicitholographic description of gravity. In section 3.2, we review the direct tests of the duality, including matching the spectrum of chiral primary operators and some correlationfunctions and anomalies. Computation of correlation functions is reviewed in section3.3. The isomorphism of the Hilbert spaces of string theory on AdS spaces and ofCFTs is decribed in section 3.4. We describe how to introduce Wilson loop operatorsin section 3.5. In section 3.6, we analyze finite temperature theories and the thermalphase transition.In chapter 4, we review other topics involving AdS5. In section 4.1, we considersome other gauge theories that arise from Dbranes at orbifolds, orientifolds, or conifoldpoints. In section 4.2, we review how baryons and instantons arise in the string theory9description. In section 4.3, we study some deformations of the CFT and how they arisein the string theory description.In chapter 5, we describe a similar correspondence involving 11 dimensional CFTsand AdS3 spaces. We also describe the relation of these results to black holes in fivedimensions.In chapter 6, we consider other examples of the AdSCFT correspondence as well asnon conformal and non supersymmetric cases. In section 6.1, we analyse the M2 and M5branes theories, and go on to describe situations that are not conformal, realized on theworldvolume of various Dpbranes, and the little string theories on the worldvolumeof NS 5branes. In section 6.2, we describe an approach to studying theories thatare confining and have a behavior similar to QCD in three and four dimensions. Wediscuss confinement, vacua, the mass spectrum and other dynamical aspects of thesetheories.Finally, the last chapter is devoted to a summary and discussion.Other reviews of this subject are 30, 31, 32, 33.1.2 Large N Gauge Theories as String TheoriesThe relation between gauge theories and string theories has been an interesting topicof research for over three decades. String theory was originally developed as a theoryfor the strong interactions, due to various stringlike aspects of the strong interactions,such as confinement and Regge behavior. It was later realized that there is anotherdescription of the strong interactions, in terms of an SU3 gauge theory QCD, whichis consistent with all experimental data to date. However, while the gauge theory description is very useful for studying the highenergy behavior of the strong interactions,it is very difficult to use it to study lowenergy issues such as confinement and chiralsymmetry breaking the only current method for addressing these issues in the fullnonAbelian gauge theory is by numerical simulations. In the last few years manyexamples of the phenomenon generally known as duality have been discovered, inwhich a single theory has at least two different descriptions, such that when onedescription is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and vice versa examples ofthis phenomenon in two dimensional field theories have been known for many years.One could hope that a similar phenomenon would apply in the theory of the stronginteractions, and that a dual description of QCD exists which would be more appropriate for studying the lowenergy regime where the gauge theory description isstrongly coupled.There are several indications that this dual description could be a string theory. QCD has in it stringlike objects which are the flux tubes or Wilson lines. If10we try to separate a quark from an antiquark, a flux tube forms between them if is a quark field, the operator 0x is not gaugeinvariant but the operator0P expi x0 Adxx is gaugeinvariant. In many ways these flux tubes behave like strings, and there have been many attempts to write down a string theorydescribing the strong interactions in which the flux tubes are the basic objects. Itis clear that such a stringy description would have many desirable phenomenologicalattributes since, after all, this is how string theory was originally discovered. The mostdirect indication from the gauge theory that it could be described in terms of a stringtheory comes from the t Hooft large N limit 3, which we will now describe in detail.YangMills YM theories in four dimensions have no dimensionless parameters, sincethe gauge coupling is dimensionally transmuted into the QCD scale QCD which is theonly mass scale in these theories. Thus, there is no obvious perturbation expansionthat can be performed to learn about the physics near the scale QCD. However, anadditional parameter of SUN gauge theories is the integer number N , and one mayhope that the gauge theories may simplify at large N despite the larger number ofdegrees of freedom, and have a perturbation expansion in terms of the parameter 1N .This turns out to be true, as shown by t Hooft based on the following analysis reviewsof large N QCD may be found in 34, 35.First, we need to understand how to scale the coupling gYM as we take N  .In an asymptotically free theory, like pure YM theory, it is natural to scale gYM sothat QCD remains constant in the large N limit. The beta function equation for pureSUN YM theory isdgYMd 113Ng3YM162Og5YM, 1.1so the leading terms are of the same order for large N if we take N   while keeping  g2YMN fixed one can show that the higher order terms are also of the same orderin this limit. This is known as the t Hooft limit. The same behavior is valid if weinclude also matter fields fermions or scalars in the adjoint representation, as long asthe theory is still asymptotically free. If the theory is conformal, such as the N  4SYM theory which we will discuss in detail below, it is not obvious that the limit ofconstant  is the only one that makes sense, and indeed we will see that other limits, inwhich  , are also possible. However, the limit of constant  is still a particularlyinteresting limit and we will focus on it in the remainder of this chapter.Instead of focusing just on the YM theory, let us describe a general theory whichhas some fields ai , where a is an index in the adjoint representation of SUN, and iis some label of the field a spin index, a flavor index, etc.. Some of these fields canbe ghost fields as will be the case in gauge theory. We will assume that as in theYM theory and in the N  4 SYM theory, the 3point vertices of all these fields areproportional to gYM , and the 4point functions to g2YM , so the Lagrangian is of the11schematic formL  Trdidi  gYMcijkTrijk  g2YMdijklTrijkl, 1.2for some constants cijk and dijkl where we have assumed that the interactions areSUNinvariant mass terms can also be added and do not change the analysis.Rescaling the fields by i  gYMi, the Lagrangian becomesL  1g2YMTrdidi  cijkTrijk  dijklTrijkl, 1.3with a coefficient of 1g2YM  N in front of the whole Lagrangian.Now, we can ask what happens to correlation functions in the limit of large Nwith constant . Naively, this is a classical limit since the coefficient in front of theLagrangian diverges, but in fact this is not true since the number of components inthe fields also goes to infinity in this limit. We can write the Feynman diagrams ofthe theory 1.3 in a double line notation, in which an adjoint field a is representedas a direct product of a fundamental and an antifundamental field, ij , as in figure1.1. The interaction vertices we wrote are all consistent with this sort of notation. Thepropagators are also consistent with it in a UN theory in an SUN theory there isa small mixing termijkl iljk 1Nijkl , 1.4which makes the expansion slightly more complicated, but this involves only subleadingterms in the large N limit so we will neglect this difference here. Ignoring the secondterm the propagator for the adjoint field is in terms of the index structure like that of afundamentalantifundamental pair. Thus, any Feynman diagram of adjoint fields maybe viewed as a network of double lines. Let us begin by analyzing vacuum diagramsthe generalization to adding external fields is simple and will be discussed below. Insuch a diagram we can view these double lines as forming the edges in a simplicialdecomposition for example, it could be a triangulation of a surface, if we view eachsingleline loop as the perimeter of a face of the simplicial decomposition. The resultingsurface will be oriented since the lines have an orientation in one direction for afundamental index and in the opposite direction for an antifundamental index. Whenwe compactify space by adding a point at infinity, each diagram thus corresponds to acompact, closed, oriented surface.What is the power of N and  associated with such a diagram From the formof 1.3 it is clear that each vertex carries a coefficient proportional to N, whilepropagators are proportional to N . Additional powers of N come from the sum overthe indices in the loops, which gives a factor of N for each loop in the diagram sinceeach index has N possible values. Thus, we find that a diagram with V vertices, E122NN0Figure 1.1 Some diagrams in a field theory with adjoint fields in the standard representation on the left and in the double line representation on the right. The dashedlines are propagators for the adjoint fields, the small circles represent interaction vertices, and solid lines carry indices in the fundamental representation.propagators  edges in the simplicial decomposition and F loops  faces in thesimplicial decomposition comes with a coefficient proportional toNVEFEV  NEV , 1.5where   V EF is the Euler character of the surface corresponding to the diagram.For closed oriented surfaces,   2 2g where g is the genus the number of handlesof the surface.2 Thus, the perturbative expansion of any diagram in the field theorymay be written as a double expansion of the formg0N22gi0cg,ii g0N22gfg, 1.6where fg is some polynomial in  in an asymptotically free theory the dependencewill turn into some QCDdependence but the general form is similar infrared divergences could also lead to the appearance of terms which are not integer powers of .In the large N limit we see that any computation will be dominated by the surfacesof maximal  or minimal genus, which are surfaces with the topology of a sphere or2We are discussing here only connected diagrams, for disconnected diagrams we have similar contributions from each connected component.13equivalently a plane. All these planar diagrams will give a contribution of order N2,while all other diagrams will be suppressed by powers of 1N2. For example, the firstdiagram in figure 1.1 is planar and proportional to N233  N2, while the second oneis not and is proportional to N462  N0. We presented our analysis for a generaltheory, but in particular it is true for any gauge theory coupled to adjoint matter fields,like the N  4 SYM theory. The rest of our discussion will be limited mostly to gaugetheories, where only gaugeinvariant SUNinvariant objects are usually of interest.The form of the expansion 1.6 is the same as one finds in a perturbative theorywith closed oriented strings, if we identify 1N as the string coupling constant3. Ofcourse, we do not really see any strings in the expansion, but just diagrams with holesin them however, one can hope that in a full nonperturbative description of the fieldtheory the holes will close and the surfaces of the Feynman diagrams will becomeactual closed surfaces. The analogy of 1.6 with perturbative string theory is oneof the strongest motivations for believing that field theories and string theories arerelated, and it suggests that this relation would be more visible in the large N limitwhere the dual string theory may be weakly coupled. However, since the analysiswas based on perturbation theory which generally does not converge, it is far from arigorous derivation of such a relation, but rather an indication that it might apply,at least for some field theories there are certainly also effects like instantons whichare nonperturbative in the 1N expansion, and an exact matching with string theorywould require a matching of such effects with nonperturbative effects in string theory.The fact that 1N behaves as a coupling constant in the large N limit can also beseen directly in the field theory analysis of the t Hooft limit. While we have derived thebehavior 1.6 only for vacuum diagrams, it actually holds for any correlation functionof a product of gaugeinvariant fieldsnj1Gjsuch that each Gj cannot be written asa product of two gaugeinvariant fields for instance, Gj can be of the form1NTrii.We can study such a correlation function by adding to the action S  S N  gjGj ,and then, if W is the sum of connected vacuum diagrams we discussed above but nowcomputed with the new action,nj1Gj iNnnWnj1 gjgj0. 1.7Our analysis of the vacuum diagrams above holds also for these diagrams, since weput in additional vertices with a factor of N , and, in the double line representation,each of the operators we inserted becomes a vertex of the simplicial decompositionof the surface this would not be true for operators which are themselves products,3In the conformal case, where  is a free parameter, there is actually a freedom of choosing thestring coupling constant to be 1N times any function of  without changing the form of the expansion,and this will be used below.14and which would correspond to more than one vertex. Thus, the leading contributiontonj1Gjwill come from planar diagrams with n additional operator insertions,leading to nj1Gj N2n 1.8in the t Hooft limit. We see that in terms of powers of N the 2point functions of theGjs come out to be canonically normalized, while 3point functions are proportionalto 1N , so indeed 1N is the coupling constant in this limit higher genus diagramsdo not affect this conclusion since they just add higher order terms in 1N. In thestring theory analogy the operators Gj would become vertex operators inserted on thestring worldsheet. For asymptotically free confining theories like QCD one can showthat in the large N limit they have an infinite spectrum of stable particles with risingmasses as expected in a free string theory. Many additional properties of the largeN limit are discussed in 36, 34 and other references.The analysis we did of the t Hooft limit for SUN theories with adjoint fieldscan easily be generalized to other cases. Matter in the fundamental representationappears as singleline propagators in the diagrams, which correspond to boundaries ofthe corresponding surfaces. Thus, if we have such matter we need to sum also oversurfaces with boundaries, as in open string theories. For SON or USpN gaugetheories we can represent the adjoint representation as a product of two fundamentalrepresentations instead of a fundamental and an antifundamental representation,and the fundamental representation is real, so no arrows appear on the propagators inthe diagram, and the resulting surfaces may be nonorientable. Thus, these theoriesseem to be related to nonorientable string theories 37. We will not discuss these casesin detail here, some of the relevant aspects will be discussed in section 4.1.2 below.Our analysis thus far indicates that gauge theories may be dual to string theorieswith a coupling proportional to 1N in the t Hooft limit, but it gives no indication as toprecisely which string theory is dual to a particular gauge theory. For two dimensionalgauge theories much progress has been made in formulating the appropriate stringtheories 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, but for four dimensional gauge theories there wasno concrete construction of a corresponding string theory before the results reportedbelow, since the planar diagram expansion which corresponds to the free string theoryis very complicated. Various direct approaches towards constructing the relevant stringtheory were attempted, many of which were based on the loop equations 46 for theWilson loop observables in the field theory, which are directly connected to a stringtype description.Attempts to directly construct a string theory equivalent to a four dimensional gaugetheory are plagued with the wellknown problems of string theory in four dimensionsor generally below the critical dimension. In particular, additional fields must be15added on the worldsheet beyond the four embedding coordinates of the string to ensureconsistency of the theory. In the standard quantization of four dimensional stringtheory an additional field called the Liouville field arises 4, which may be interpretedas a fifth spacetime dimension. Polyakov has suggested 47, 48 that such a fivedimensional string theory could be related to four dimensional gauge theories if thecouplings of the Liouville field to the other fields take some specific forms. As we willsee, the AdSCFT correspondence realizes this idea, but with five additional dimensionsin addition to the radial coordinate on AdS which can be thought of as a generalizationof the Liouville field, leading to a standard critical ten dimensional string theory.1.3 Black pBranesThe recent insight into the connection between large N field theories and string theoryhas emerged from the study of pbranes in string theory. The pbranes were originallyfound as classical solutions to supergravity, which is the low energy limit of stringtheory. Later it was pointed out by Polchinski that Dbranes give their full stringtheoretical description. Various comparisons of the two descriptions led to the discoveryof the AdSCFT correspondence.1.3.1 Classical SolutionsString theory has a variety of classical solutions corresponding to extended black holes49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59. Complete descriptions of all possible blackhole solutions would be beyond the scope of this review, and we will discuss here onlyillustrative examples corresponding to parallel Dp branes. For a more extensive reviewof extended objects in string theory, see 60, 61.Let us consider type II string theory in ten dimensions, and look for a black holesolution carrying electric charge with respect to the RamondRamond RR p  1form Ap1 50, 55, 58. In type IIA IIB theory, p is even odd. The theory containsalso magnetically charged 6pbranes, which are electrically charged under the dualdA7p  dAp1 potential. Therefore, RR charges have to be quantized according tothe Dirac quantization condition. To find the solution, we start with the low energyeffective action in the string frame,S 127l8sd10xge2R 42 28 pF2p2, 1.9where ls is the string length, related to the string tension 21 as   l2s , and Fp2is the field strength of the p  1form potential, Fp2  dAp1. In the selfdual caseof p  3 we work directly with the equations of motion. We then look for a solution16corresponding to a pdimensional electric source of charge N for Ap1, by requiring theEuclidean symmetry ISOp in pdimensionsds2  ds210p  epi1dxidxi. 1.10Here ds210p is a Lorentziansignature metric in 10  pdimensions. We also assumethat the metric is spherically symmetric in 10p dimensions with the RR source atthe origin, S8pFp2  N, 1.11where S8p is the 8  psphere surrounding the source. By using the Euclideansymmetry ISOp, we can reduce the problem to the one of finding a sphericallysymmetric charged black hole solution in 10p dimensions 50, 55, 58. The resultingmetric, in the string frame, is given byds2   ffdt2fpi1dxidxif 12 5p7pfd2r2f12 5p7pd28p, 1.12with the dilaton field,e2  g2s f p32 , 1.13wheref  1r7p, 1.14and gs is the asymptotic string coupling constant. The parameters r and r arerelated to the mass M per unit volume and the RR charge N of the solution byM 17 p27dpl8P8 pr7p  r7p, N 1dpgsl7psrr7p2 , 1.15where lP  g14s ls is the 10dimensional Planck length and dp is a numerical factor,dp  25p5p2 7 p2. 1.16The metric in the Einstein frame, gE , is defined by multiplying the string framemetric g bygse in 1.9, so that the action takes the standard EinsteinHilbertform,S 127l8Pd10xgERE 122    . 1.17The Einstein frame metric has a horizon at   r. For p  6, there is also a curvaturesingularity at   r. When r  r, the singularity is covered by the horizon and17the solution can be regarded as a black hole. When r  r, there is a timelike nakedsingularity and the Cauchy problem is not wellposed.The situation is subtle in the critical case r  r. If p 6 3, the horizon and thesingularity coincide and there is a null singularity4. Moreover, the dilaton eitherdiverges or vanishes at   r. This singularity, however, is milder than in the case ofr  r, and the supergravity description is still valid up to a certain distance fromthe singularity. The situation is much better for p  3. In this case, the dilaton isconstant. Moreover, the   r surface is regular even when r  r, allowing asmooth analytic extension beyond   r 62.According to 1.15, for a fixed value of N , the mass M is an increasing function ofr. The condition r  r for the absence of the timelike naked singularity thereforetranslates into an inequality between the mass M and the RR charge N , of the formM  N2pgslp1s. 1.18The solution whose massM is at the lower bound of this inequality is called an extremalpbrane. On the other hand, when M is strictly greater than that, we have a nonextremal black pbrane. It is called black since there is an event horizon for r  r.The area of the black hole horizon goes to zero in the extremal limit r  r. Sincethe extremal solution with p 6 3 has a singularity, the supergravity description breaksdown near   r and we need to use the full string theory. The Dbrane constructiondiscussed below will give exactly such a description. The inequality 1.18 is alsothe BPS bound with respect to the 10dimensional supersymmetry, and the extremalsolution r  r preserves one half of the supersymmetry in the regime where we cantrust the supergravity description. This suggests that the extremal pbrane is a groundstate of the black pbrane for a given charge N .The extremal limit r  r of the solution 1.12 is given byds2 fdt2 pi1dxidxi f 32 5p7pd2  2f12 5p7pd28p. 1.19In this limit, the symmetry of the metric is enhanced from the Euclidean group ISOpto the Poincare group ISOp, 1. This fits well with the interpretation that the extremalsolution corresponds to the ground state of the black pbrane. To describe the geometryof the extremal solution outside of the horizon, it is often useful to define a newcoordinate r byr7p  7p  r7p , 1.204This is the case for p  6. For p  6, the singularity is timelike as one can see from the fact thatit can be lifted to the KaluzaKlein monopole in 11 dimensions.18and introduce the isotropic coordinates, ra  ra a  1, ..., 9 p aa2  1. Themetric and the dilaton for the extremal pbrane are then written asds2 1Hrdt2 pi1dxidxiHr9pa1dradra, 1.21e  gsHr3p4 , 1.22whereHr 1f 1 r7pr7p, r7p  dpgsNl7ps . 1.23The horizon is now located at r  0.In general, 1.21 and 1.22 give a solution to the supergravity equations of motionfor any function Hr which is a harmonic function in the 9  p dimensions whichare transverse to the pbrane. For example, we may consider a more general solution,of the formHr  1 ki1r7pir  ri7p, r7pi  dpgsNil7ps . 1.24This is called a multicentered solution and represents parallel extremal pbranes located at k different locations, r  ri i  1,    , k, each of which carries Ni units ofthe RR charge.So far we have discussed the black pbrane using the classical supergravity. Thisdescription is appropriate when the curvature of the pbrane geometry is small compared to the string scale, so that stringy corrections are negligible. Since the strengthof the curvature is characterized by r, this requires r  ls. To suppress string loopcorrections, the effective string coupling e also needs to be kept small. When p  3,the dilaton is constant and we can make it small everywhere in the 3brane geometry by setting gs  1, namely lP  ls. If gs  1 we might need to do an Sduality,gs  1gs, first. Moreover, in this case it is known that the metric 1.21 can beanalytically extended beyond the horizon r  0, and that the maximally extendedmetric is geodesically complete and without a singularity 62. The strength of the curvature is then uniformly bounded by r2 . To summarize, for p  3, the supergravityapproximation is valid whenlP  ls  r. 1.25Since r is related to the RR charge N asr7p  dpgsNl7ps , 1.26this can also be expressed as1  gsN  N. 1.27For p 6 3, the metric is singular at r  0, and the supergravity description is validonly in a limited region of the spacetime.191.3.2 DBranesAlternatively, the extremal pbrane can be described as a Dbrane. For a review of Dbranes, see 63. The Dpbrane is a p1dimensional hyperplane in spacetime wherean open string can end. By the worldsheet duality, this means that the Dbrane is alsoa source of closed strings see Fig. 1.2. In particular, it can carry the RR charges.It was shown in 6 that, if we put N Dpbranes on top of each other, the resultingp 1dimensional hyperplane carries exactly N units of the p 1form charge. Onthe worldsheet of a type II string, the leftmoving degrees of freedom and the rightmoving degrees of freedom carry separate spacetime supercharges. Since the openstring boundary condition identifies the left and right movers, the Dbrane breaks atleast one half of the spacetime supercharges. In type IIA IIB string theory, preciselyone half of the supersymmetry is preserved if p is even odd. This is consistent withthe types of RR charges that appear in the theory. Thus, the Dpbrane is a BPS objectin string theory which carries exactly the same charge as the black pbrane solution insupergravity.a bFigure 1.2 a The Dbrane is where open strings can end. b The Dbrane is a sourceof closed strings.It is believed that the extremal pbrane in supergravity and the Dpbrane are twodifferent descriptions of the same object. The Dbrane uses the string worldsheet and,therefore, is a good description in string perturbation theory. When there are N Dbranes on top of each other, the effective loop expansion parameter for the open stringsis gsN rather than gs, since each open string boundary loop ending on the Dbranescomes with the ChanPaton factor N as well as the string coupling gs. Thus, the Dbrane description is good when gsN  1. This is complementary to the regime 1.27where the supergravity description is appropriate.The low energy effective theory of open strings on the Dpbrane is the UN gauge20theory in p  1 dimensions with 16 supercharges 9. The theory has 9  p scalarfields  in the adjoint representation of UN. If the vacuum expectation value  hask distinct eigenvalues5, with N1 identical eigenvalues 1, N2 identical eigenvalues 2and so on, the gauge group UN is broken to UN1   UNk. This correspondsto the situation when N1 Dbranes are at r1  1l2s , N2 Dpbranes are at r2 2l2s ,and so on. In this case, there are massive W bosons for the broken gauge groups.The W boson in the bifundamental representation of UNi UNj comes from theopen string stretching between the Dbranes at ri and rj, and the mass of the Wboson is proportional to the Euclidean distance ri  rj between the Dbranes. It isimportant to note that the same result is obtained if we use the supergravity solutionfor the multicentered pbrane 1.24 and compute the mass of the string going fromri to rj, since the factor Hr14 from the metric in the rspace 1.21 is cancelled bythe redshift factor Hr14 when converting the string tension into energy. Both theDbrane description and the supergravity solution give the same value of the Wbosonmass, since it is determined by the BPS condition.1.3.3 Greybody Factors and Black HolesAn important precursor to the AdSCFT correspondence was the calculation of greybody factors for black holes built out of Dbranes. It was noted in 14 that Hawkingradiation could be mimicked by processes where two open strings collide on a Dbraneand form a closed string which propagates into the bulk. The classic computation ofHawking see, for example, 64 for details shows in a semiclassical approximationthat the differential rate of spontaneous emission of particles of energy  from a blackhole isdemit vabsorbeTH  1dnk2n, 1.28where v is the velocity of the emitted particle in the transverse directions, and the signin the denominator is minus for bosons and plus for fermions. We use n to denote thenumber of spatial dimensions around the black hole or if we are dealing with a blackbrane, it is the number of spatial dimensions perpendicular to the worldvolume of thebrane. TH is the Hawking temperature, and absorb is the crosssection for a particlecoming in from infinity to be absorbed by the black hole. In the differential emissionrate, the emitted particle is required to have a momentum in a small region dnk, and is a function of k. To obtain a total emission rate we would integrate 1.28 over allk.If absorb were a constant, then 1.28 tells us that the emission spectrum is the same5There is a potentialI,J TrI ,J 2 for the scalar fields, so expectation values of the matricesI I  1,    , 9 p minimizing the potential are simultaneously diagonalizable.21as that of a blackbody. Typically, absorb is not constant, but varies appreciably overthe range of finite TH. The consequent deviations from the pure blackbody spectrumhave earned absorb the name greybody factor. A successful microscopic account ofblack hole thermodynamics should be able to predict these greybody factors. In 16and its many successors, it was shown that the Dbranes provided an account of blackhole microstates which was successful in this respect.Our first goal will be to see how greybody factors are computed in the context ofquantum fields in curved spacetime. The literature on this subject is immense. Werefer the reader to 65 for an overview of the General Relativity literature, and to18, 11, 61 and references therein for a first look at the string theory additions.In studying scattering of particles off of a black hole or any fixed target, it is convenient to make a partial wave expansion. For simplicity, let us restrict the discussionto scalar fields. Assuming that the black hole is spherically symmetric, one can writethe asymptotic behavior at infinity of the timeindependent scattering solution asr  eikx  f eikrrn2012Pcos Seikr  1ineikrikrn2,1.29where x  r cos . The term eikx represents the incident wave, and the second termin the first line represents the scattered wave. The Pcos  are generalizations ofLegendre polynomials. The absorption probability for a given partial wave is given byP  1  S2. An application of the Optical Theorem leads to the absorption crosssection 66abs 2n1n12knn 12n 12 n 2P . 1.30Sometimes the absorption probability P is called the greybody factor.The strategy of absorption calculations in supergravity is to solve a linearized waveequation, most often the KleinGordon equation   0, using separation of variables,  eitPcos Rr. Typically the radial function cannot be expressed in terms ofknown functions, so some approximation scheme is used, as we will explain in moredetail below. Boundary conditions are imposed at the black hole horizon correspondingto infalling matter. Once the solution is obtained, one can either use the asymptotics1.29 to obtain S and from it P and abs, or compute the particle flux at infinityand at the horizon and note that particle number conservation implies that P is theirratio.One of the few known universal results is that for TH  1, abs for an swavemassless scalar approaches the horizon area of the black hole 67. This result holds22for any spherically symmetric black hole in any dimension. For  much larger thanany characteristic curvature scale of the geometry, one can use the geometric opticsapproximation to find abs.We will be interested in the particular black hole geometries for which string theoryprovides a candidate description of the microstates. Let us start with N coincidentD3branes, where the lowenergy worldvolume theory is d  4 N  4 UN gaugetheory. The equation of motion for the dilaton is   0 where is the laplacian forthe metricds2 1 R4r412 dt2  dx21  dx22  dx231 R4r412 dr2  r2d25. 1.31It is convenient to change radial variables r  Rez,   e2z. The radial equationfor the th partial wave is2z  22R2 cosh 2z   22z  0 , 1.32which is precisely Schrodingers equation with a potential V z  22R2 cosh 2z. Theabsorption probability is precisely the tunneling probability for the barrier V z thetransmitted wave at large positive z represents particles falling into the D3branes. Atleading order in small R, the absorption probability for the th partial wave isP 42 14 22R284. 1.33This result, together with a recursive algorithm for computing all corrections as aseries in R, was obtained in 68 from properties of associated Mathieu functions,which are the solutions of 1.32. An exact solution of a radial equation in terms ofknown special functions is rare. We will therefore present a standard approximationtechnique developed in 69 and applied to the problem at hand in 10 which issufficient to obtain the leading term of 1.33. Besides, for comparison with stringtheory predictions we are generally interested only in this leading term.The idea is to find limiting forms of the radial equation which can be solved exactly,and then to match the limiting solutions together to approximate the full solution.Usually a uniformly good approximation can be found in the limit of small energy. Thereason, intuitively speaking, is that on a compact range of radii excluding asymptoticinfinity and the horizon, the zero energy solution is nearly equal to solutions with verysmall energy and outside this region the wave equation usually has a simple limitingform. So one solves the equation in various regions and then matches together a globalsolution.23It is elementary to show that this can be done for 1.32 using two regionsfar region z  logR2z  2R2e2z   22  0z  H12Reznear region z   logR2z  2R2e2z   22  0z  aJ2Rez1.34It is amusing to note the Z2 symmetry, z  z, which exchanges the far region,where the first equation in 1.34 is just free particle propagation in flat space, andthe near region, where the second equation in 1.34 describes a free particle in AdS5.This peculiar symmetry was first pointed out in 10. It follows from the fact that thefull D3brane metric comes back to itself, up to a conformal rescaling, if one sendsr  R2r. A similar duality exists between sixdimensional flat space and AdS3  S3in the D1D5brane solution, where the Laplace equation again can be solved in termsof Mathieu functions 70, 71. To our knowledge there is no deep understanding of thisinversion duality.For low energies R  1, the near and far regions overlap in a large domain,logR z   logR, and by comparing the solutions in this overlap region one canfix a and reproduce the leading term in 1.33. It is possible but tedious to obtain theleading correction by treating the small terms which were dropped from the potentialto obtain the limiting forms in 1.34 as perturbations. This strategy was pursuedin 72, 73 before the exact solution was known, and in cases where there is no exactsolution. The validity of the matching technique is discussed in 65, but we know ofno rigorous proof that it holds in all the circumstances in which it has been applied.The successful comparison of the swave dilaton crosssection in 10 with a perturbative calculation on the D3brane worldvolume was the first hint that Greensfunctions of N  4 superYangMills theory could be computed from supergravity.In summarizing the calculation, we will follow more closely the conventions of 11,and give an indication of the first application of nonrenormalization arguments 12 tounderstand why the agreement between supergravity and perturbative gauge theoryexisted despite their applicability in opposite limits of the t Hooft coupling.Setting normalization conventions so that the pole in the propagator of the gaugebosons has residue one at tree level, we have the following action for the dilaton plusthe fields on the braneS 122d10xgR 122  . . .d4x14eTrF 2  . . ., 1.35where we have omitted other supergravity fields, their interactions with one another,and also terms with the lower spin fields in the gauge theory action. A plane wave24of dilatons with energy  and momentum perpendicular to the brane is kinematicallyequivalent on the worldvolume to a massive particle which can decay into two gaugebosons through the coupling 14TrF 2 . In fact, the absorption crosssection is givenprecisely by the usual expression for the decay rate into k particlesabs 1Sf12d3p12321. . .d3pk232k244Pf  PiM2. 1.36In the Feynman rules for M, a factor of22 attaches to an external dilaton line onaccount of the nonstandard normalization of its kinetic term in 1.35. This factorgives abs the correct dimensions it is a length to the fifth power, as appropriate for sixtransverse spatial dimensions. In 1.36, M2 indicates summation over distinguishableprocesses in the case of the swave dilaton there are N2 such processes because of thenumber of gauge bosons. One easily verifies that M2  N224. Sf is a symmetryfactor for identical particles in the final state in the case of the swave dilaton, Sf  2because the outgoing gauge bosons are identical.Carrying out the   0 calculation explicitly, one findsabs N22332, 1.37which, using 1.30 and the relation between R and N , can be shown to be in preciseagreement with the leading term of P0 in 1.33. This is now understood to be due toa nonrenormalization theorem for the twopoint function of the operator O4  14TrF 2.To understand the connection with twopoint functions, note that an absorptioncalculation is insensitive to the final state on the Dbrane worldvolume. The absorptioncrosssection is therefore related to the discontinuity in the cut of the twopoint functionof the operator to which the external field couples. To state a result of some generality,let us suppose that a scalar field  in ten dimensions couples to a gauge theory operatorthrough the actionSint d4x yi1   yix, yiyi0Oi1...ix , 1.38where we use x to denote the four coordinates parallel to the worldvolume and yi todenote the other six. An example where this would be the right sort of coupling is theth partial wave of the dilaton 11.

The factor of  arises fromacting with the  derivatives in 1.38 on the incoming plane wave state. The symbolDisc indicates that one is looking at the unitarity cut in the twopoint function in thes plane, where s  p2. The twopoint function can be reconstructed uniquely fromthis cut, together with some weak conditions on regularity for large momenta. Resultsanalogous to 1.39 can be stated for incoming particles with spin, only it becomesmore complicated because a polarization must be specified, and the twopoint functionin momentum space includes a polynomial in p which depends on the polarization.Expressing absorption crosssections in terms of twopoint functions helps illustratewhy there is ever agreement between the treelevel calculation indicated in 1.36 andthe supergravity result, which one would a priori expect to pick up all sorts of radiative corrections. Indeed, it was observed in 12 that the swave graviton crosssection agreed between supergravity and treelevel gauge theory because the correlatorTT enjoys a nonrenormalization theorem. One way to see that there must besuch a nonrenormalization theorem is to note that conformal Ward identities relatethis twopoint function to T  TT see for example 74 for the details, and supersymmetry in turn relates this anomalous threepoint function to the anomalousVEVs of the divergence of Rcurrents in the presence of external sources for them.The AdlerBardeen theorem 75 protects these anomalies, hence the conclusion.Another case which has been studied extensively is a system consisting of severalD1 and D5 branes. The D1branes are delocalized on the four extra dimensions ofthe D5brane, which are taken to be small, so that the total system is effectively 116There is one restriction on the final states for a process to be regarded as an th partial waveabsorption crosssection,  units of angular momentum must be picked up by the brane.

We will discuss the physics of this system more extensively in chapter 5,and the reader can also find background material in 61. For now our purpose isto show how supergravity absorption calculations relate to finitetemperature Greensfunctions in the 11dimensional theory.Introducing momentum along the spatial worldvolume carried by open strings attached to the branes, one obtains the following tendimensional metric and dilatonds210,str  H121 H125dt2  dx25 r20r2cosh dt sinh dx52H121 H1254i1dy2i H121 H1251 r20r21dr2  r2d23e  H121 H125H1  1 r21r2H5  1 r25r2.1.40The quantities r21, r25, and r2K  r20 sinh2  are related to the number of D1branes, thenumber of D5branes, and the net number of units of momentum in the x5 direction,respectively. The horizon radius, r0, is related to the nonextremality. For details, seefor example 18. If r0  0 then there are only leftmoving open strings on the worldvolume if r0 6 0 then there are both leftmovers and rightmovers. The Hawkingtemperature can be expressed as 2TH 1TL 1TR, whereTL 1r0e2r1r5TR 1r0e2r1r5. 1.41TL and TR have the interpretation of temperatures of the leftmoving and rightmovingsectors of the 11dimensional worldvolume theory. There is a detailed and remarkably successful account of the BekensteinHawking entropy using statistical mechanicsin the worldvolume theory. It was initiated in 13, developed in a number of subsequent papers, and has been reviewed in 61.The region of parameter space which we will be interested in isr0, rK  r1, r5 1.42This is known as the dilute gas regime. The total energy of the open strings on thebranes is much less than the constituent mass of either the D1branes or the D5branes.We are also interested in low energies r1, r5  1, but TL,R can be arbitrary thanksto 1.42, 1.41. The D1D5brane system is not stable because leftmoving openstrings can run into rightmoving open string and form a closed string indeed, thisis exactly the process we aim to quantify. Since we have collisions of left and right27moving excitations we expect that the answer will contain the left and right movingoccupation factors, so that the emission rate isd  g2eff1e2TL  11e2TR  1d4k241.43where geff is independent of the temperature and measures the coupling of the openstrings to the closed strings. The functional form of 1.43 seems, at first sight, to bedifferent from 1.28. But in order to compare them we should calculate the absorptioncross section appearing in 1.28.Offdiagonal gravitons hy1y2 with y1,2 in the compact directions reduce to scalarsin six dimensions which obey the massless Klein Gordon equation. These socalledminimal scalars have been the subject of the most detailed study. We will consideronly the swave and we take the momentum along the string to be zero.

The Compton wavelength of the particleswe scatter is much larger than the gravitational size,   r5. In this situation wereplace the whole black hole geometry a by a pointlike system in the transversecoordinates with localized excitations b. These excitations are the ones described bythe field theory living on the brane.It is possible to be more precise and calculate the coefficient in 1.43 and actuallycheck that the matching is precise 16. We leave this to chapter 5.Both in the D3brane analysis and in the D1D5brane analysis, one can see that allthe interesting physics is resulting from the nearhorizon region the far region wavefunction describes free particle propagation. For quanta whose Compton wavelength ismuch larger than the size of the black hole, the effect of the far region is merely to setthe boundary conditions in the near region. See figure 1.4. This provides a motivationfor the prescription for computing Greens functions, to be described in section 3.3 asthe calculations of this section demonstrate, cutting out the nearhorizon region of thesupergravity geometry and replacing it with the Dbranes leads to an identical responseto lowenergy external probes.29Chapter 2Conformal Field Theories and AdSSpaces2.1 Conformal Field TheoriesSymmetry principles, and in particular Lorentz and Poincare invariance, play a majorrole in our understanding of quantum field theory. It is natural to look for possiblegeneralizations of Poincare invariance in the hope that they may play some role inphysics in 76 it was argued that for theories with a nontrivial Smatrix there areno such bosonic generalizations. An interesting generalization of Poincare invarianceis the addition of a scale invariance symmetry linking physics at different scales thisis inconsistent with the existence of an Smatrix since it does not allow the standarddefinition of asymptotic states. Many interesting field theories, like YangMills theoryin four dimensions, are scaleinvariant generally this scale invariance does not extendto the quantum theory whose definition requires a cutoff which explicitly breaks scaleinvariance but in some special cases such as the d  4,N  4 supersymmetric YangMills theory it does, and even when it does not like in QCD it can still be a usefultool, leading to relations like the CallanSymanzik equation. It was realized in the past30 years that field theories generally exhibit a renormalization group flow from somescaleinvariant often free UV fixed point to some scaleinvariant sometimes trivialIR fixed point, and statistical mechanics systems also often have nontrivial IR scaleinvariant fixed points. Thus, studying scaleinvariant theories is interesting for variousphysical applications.It is widely believed that unitary interacting scaleinvariant theories are always invariant under the full conformal group, which is a simple group including scale invariance and Poincare invariance. This has only been proven in complete generality fortwo dimensional field theories 77, 78, but there are no known counterexamples. Inthis section we will review the conformal group and its implications for field theories,30focusing on implications which will be useful in the context of the AdSCFT correspondence. General reviews on conformal field theories may be found in 79, 80, 81and references therein.2.1.1 The Conformal Group and AlgebraThe conformal group is the group of transformations which preserve the form of themetric up to an arbitrary scale factor, gx  2xgx in this section greekletters will correspond to the spacetime coordinates, ,   0,    , d  1. It is theminimal group that includes the Poincare group as well as the inversion symmetryx  xx2.The conformal group of Minkowski space1 is generated by the Poincare transformations, the scale transformationx  x, 2.1and the special conformal transformationsx  x  ax21  2xa  a2x2. 2.2We will denote the generators of these transformations by M for the Lorentz transformations, P for translations, D for the scaling transformation 2.1 and K for thespecial conformal transformations 2.2. The vacuum of a conformal theory is annihilated by all of these generators. They obey the conformal algebraM , P  iP  P M , K  iK  KM ,M  iM  permutations M , D  0 D,K  iKD,P  iP P, K   2iM  2iD,2.3with all other commutators vanishing. This algebra is isomorphic to the algebra ofSOd, 2, and can be put in the standard form of the SOd, 2 algebra with signature,,,    ,, with generators Jab a, b  0,    , d 1 by definingJ M  Jd 12KP Jd1 12KP Jd1d  D. 2.4For some applications it is useful to study the conformal theory in Euclidean space inthis case the conformal group is SOd 1, 1,2 and since Rd is conformally equivalentto Sd the field theory on Rd with appropriate boundary conditions at infinity is1More precisely, some of these transformations can take finite points in Minkowski space to infinity,so they should be defined on a compactification of Minkowski space which includes points at infinity.2Strictly speaking, SOd1, 1 is the connected component of the conformal group which includesthe identity, and it does not include x  xx2. We will hereafter ignore such subtleties.31isomorphic to the theory on Sd. Much of what we say below will apply also to theEuclidean theory.In the special case of d  2 the conformal group is larger, and in fact it is infinitedimensional. The special aspects of this case will be discussed in chapter 5 where theywill be needed.2.1.2 Primary Fields, Correlation Functions, and OperatorProduct ExpansionsThe interesting representations for physical applications of the conformal group involve operators or fields which are eigenfunctions of the scaling operator D witheigenvalue i  is called the scaling dimension of the field. This means that underthe scaling transformation 2.1 they transform as x  x  x. The commutation relations 2.3 imply that the operator P raises the dimension of the field,while the operator K lowers it. In unitary field theories there is a lower bound on thedimension of fields for scalar fields it is   d22 which is the dimension of a freescalar field, and, therefore, each representation of the conformal group which appearsmust have some operator of lowest dimension, which must then be annihilated by Kat x  0. Such operators are called primary operators. The action of the conformalgroup on such operators is given by 82P,x  ix,M ,x  ix  x   x,D,x  i xx,K,x  ix2  2xx  2x 2x x,2.5where  are the matrices of a finite dimensional representation of the Lorentz group,acting on the indices of the  field. The representations of the conformal group corresponding to primary operators are classified by the Lorentz representation and thescaling dimension  these determine the Casimirs of the conformal group. Theserepresentations include the primary field and all the fields which are obtained by acting on it with the generators of the conformal group specifically with P. Since theoperators in these representations are eigenfunctions of D, they cannot in general beeigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian P0 or of the mass operatorM2  P P which is aCasimir operator of the Poincare group but not of the conformal group in fact, theyhave a continuous spectrum ofM2 ranging from 0 to  there are also representationscorresponding to free massless fields which have M2  0.Another possible classification of the representations of the conformal group is interms of its maximal compact subgroup, which is SOd  SO2. The generator of32SO2 is J0d1 12K0  P0, and the representations of the conformal group described above may be decomposed into representations of this subgroup. This is usefulin particular for the oscillator constructions of the representations of superconformalalgebras 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, which we will not describe in detail here see90 for a recent review. This subgroup is also useful in the radial quantization ofthe conformal field theory on Sd1  R, which will be related to AdS space in globalcoordinates.Since the conformal group is much larger than the Poincare group, it severely restrictsthe correlation functions of primary fields, which must be invariant under conformaltransformations. It has been shown by Luscher and Mack 91 that the EuclideanGreens functions of a CFT may be analytically continued to Minkowski space, andthat the resulting Hilbert space carries a unitary representation of the Lorentzianconformal group. The formulas we will write here for correlation functions apply bothin Minkowski and in Euclidean space. It is easy to show using the conformal algebrathat the 2point functions of fields of different dimension vanish, while for a singlescalar field of scaling dimension  we have0x  1x2 1x2. 2.63point functions are also determined up to a constant by the conformal group to beof the formix1jx2kx3 cijkx1  x2123x1  x3132x2  x3231. 2.7Similar expressions possibly depending on additional constants arise for nonscalarfields. With 4 independent xi one can construct two combinations of the xi known asharmonic ratios which are conformally invariant, so the correlation function can be anyfunction of these combinations for higher npoint functions there are more and moreindependent functions which can appear in the correlation functions. Many other properties of conformal field theories are also easily determined using the conformal invariance for instance, their equation of state is necessarily of the form S  cV EV d1dfor some constant c.The field algebra of any conformal field theory includes the energymomentum tensorT which is an operator of dimension   d the Ward identities of the conformal algebra relate correlation functions with T to correlation functions without T . Similarly,whenever there are global symmetries, their conserved currents J are necessarilyoperators of dimension   d  1. The scaling dimensions of other operators are notdetermined by the conformal group, and generally they receive quantum corrections.For any type of field there is, however, a lower bound on its dimension which follows33from unitarity as mentioned above, for scalar fields the bound is   d22, whereequality can occur only for free scalar fields.A general property of local field theories is the existence of an operator productexpansion OPE. As we bring two operators O1x and O2y to the same point, theirproduct creates a general local disturbance at that point, which may be expressed asa sum of local operators acting at that point in general all operators with the sameglobal quantum numbers as O1O2 may appear. The general expression for the OPEis O1xO2y n Cn12x  yOny, where this expression should be understood asappearing inside correlation functions, and the coefficient functions Cn12 do not dependon the other operators in the correlation function the expression is useful when thedistance to all other operators is much larger than x y. In a conformal theory, thefunctional form of the OPE coefficients is determined by conformal invariance to beCn12x  y  cn12x  y12n, where the constants cn12 are related to the 3pointfunctions described above. The leading terms in the OPE of the energymomentumtensor with primary fields are determined by the conformal algebra. For instance, fora scalar primary field  of dimension  in four dimensions,Tx0  01x2     . 2.8One of the basic properties of conformal field theories is the onetoone correspondence between local operators O and states O in the radial quantization of the theory.In radial quantization the time coordinate is chosen to be the radial direction in Rd,with the origin corresponding to past infinity, so that the field theory lives on RSd1.The Hamiltonian in this quantization is the operator J0d1 mentioned above. An operator O can then be mapped to the state O  limx0Ox0. Equivalently, thestate may be viewed as a functional of field values on some ball around the origin, andthen the state corresponding to O is defined by a functional integral on a ball aroundthe origin with the insertion of the operator O at the origin. The inverse mapping ofstates to operators proceeds by taking a state which is a functional of field values onsome ball around the origin and using conformal invariance to shrink the ball to zerosize, in which case the insertion of the state is necessarily equivalent to the insertionof some local operator.2.1.3 Superconformal Algebras and Field TheoriesAnother interesting generalization of the Poincare algebra is the supersymmetry algebra, which includes additional fermionic operators Q which anticommute to the translation operators P. It is interesting to ask whether supersymmetry and the conformalgroup can be joined together to form the largest possible simple algebra including the34Poincare group it turns out that in some dimensions and for some numbers of supersymmetry charges this is indeed possible. The full classification of superconformalalgebras was given by Nahm 92 it turns out that superconformal algebras exist onlyfor d  6. In addition to the generators of the conformal group and the supersymmetry, superconformal algebras include two other types of generators. There are fermionicgenerators S one for each supersymmetry generator which arise in the commutatorof K with Q, and there are sometimes Rsymmetry generators forming some Liealgebra, which appear in the anticommutator of Q and S the generators Q and S arein the fundamental representation of this Lie algebra. Schematically suppressing allindices, the commutation relations of the superconformal algebra include, in additionto 2.3, the relationsD,Q   i2Q D,S i2S K,Q  S P, S  QQ,Q  P  S, S  K Q, S M D R.2.9The exact form of the commutation relations is different for different dimensions sincethe spinorial representations of the conformal group behave differently and for differentRsymmetry groups, and we will not write them explicitly here.For free field theories without gravity, which do not include fields whose spin isbigger than one, the maximal possible number of supercharges is 16 a review of fieldtheories with this number of supercharges appears in 93 it is believed that this is themaximal possible number of supercharges also in interacting field theories. Therefore,the maximal possible number of fermionic generators in a field theory superconformalalgebra is 32. Superconformal field theories with this number of supercharges existonly for d  3, 4, 6 d  1 may also be possible but there are no known examples. Ford  3 the Rsymmetry group is Spin8 and the fermionic generators are in the 4, 8of SO3, 2 Spin8 for d  4 the Rsymmetry group is SU4 and3 the fermionicgenerators are in the 4, 44, 4 of SO4, 2SU4 and for d  6 the Rsymmetrygroup is Sp2  SO5 and the fermionic generators are in the 8, 4 representationof SO6, 2 Sp2.Since the conformal algebra is a subalgebra of the superconformal algebra, representations of the superconformal algebra split into several representations of the conformalalgebra. Generally a primary field of the superconformal algebra, which is by definition annihilated at x  0 by the generators K and S, will include several primariesof the conformal algebra, which arise by acting with the supercharges Q on the superconformal primary field. The superconformal algebras have special representationscorresponding to chiral primary operators, which are primary operators which are annihilated by some combination of the supercharges. These representations are smaller3Note that this is different from the other N extended superconformal algebras in four dimensionswhich have a UN  Rsymmetry.35than the generic representations, containing less conformalprimary fields. A specialproperty of chiral primary operators is that their dimension is uniquely determined bytheir Rsymmetry representations and cannot receive any quantum corrections. Thisfollows by using the fact that all the S generators and some of the Q generators annihilate the field, and using the Q, S commutation relation to compute the eigenvalueof D in terms of the Lorentz and Rsymmetry representations 94, 95, 96, 93, 97. Thedimensions of nonchiral primary fields of the same representation are always strictlylarger than those of the chiral primary fields. A simple example is the d  4,N  1superconformal algebra which has a U1 Rsymmetry group in this case a chiralmultiplet annihilated by Q which is a primary is also a chiral primary, and the algebracan be used to prove that the dimension of the scalar component of such multipletsis   32R where R is the U1 Rcharge. A detailed description of the structure ofchiral primaries in the d  4,N  4 algebra will appear in section 3.2.When the Rsymmetry group is Abelian, we find a bound of the form   aRfor some constant a, ensuring that there is no singularity in the OPE of two chiral  aR or antichiral   aR  aR operators. On the other hand, whenthe Rsymmetry group is nonAbelian, singularities can occur in the OPEs of chiraloperators, and are avoided only when the product lies in particular representations.2.2 Antide Sitter Space2.2.1 Geometry of Antide Sitter SpaceIn this section, we will review some geometric facts about antide Sitter space. Oneof the important facts is the relation between the conformal compactifications of AdSand of flat space. In the case of the Euclidean signature metric, it is wellknownthat the flat space Rn can be compactified to the nsphere Sn by adding a point atinfinity, and a conformal field theory is naturally defined on Sn. On the other hand,the n1dimensional hyperbolic space, which is the Euclidean version of AdS space,can be conformally mapped into the n  1dimensional disk Dn1. Therefore theboundary of the compactified hyperbolic space is the compactified Euclid space. Asimilar correspondence holds in the case with the Lorentzian signature metric, as wewill see below.Conformal Structure of Flat SpaceOne of the basic features of the AdSCFT correspondence is the identification of theisometry group of AdSp2 with the conformal symmetry of flat Minkowski space R1,p.Therefore, it would be appropriate to start our discussion by reviewing the conformal36structure of flat space. R1,1We begin with twodimensional Minkowski space R1,1ds2  dt2  dx2,   t, x  . 2.10This metric can be rewritten by the following coordinate transformationsds2  dudu , u  t x14 cos2 u cos2 ud 2  d2 , u  tan u u    2.2.11In this way, the Minkowski space is conformally mapped into the interior of the compact region, u  2, as shown in figure 2.1. Since light ray trajectories are invariantunder a conformal rescaling of the metric, this provides a convenient way to expressthe causal structure of R1,1. The new coordinates ,  are well defined at the asymptotical regions of the flat space. Therefore, the conformal compactification is used togive a rigorous definition of asymptotic flatness of spacetime  a spacetime is calledasymptotically flat if it has the same boundary structure as that of the flat space afterconformal compactification. xconst tconstFigure 2.1 Twodimensional Minkowski space is conformally mapped into the interiorof the rectangle.The two corners of the rectangle at ,   0, correspond to the spatial infinitiesx   in the original coordinates. By identifying these two points, we can embed37identify0 Figure 2.2 The rectangular region can be embedded in a cylinder, with    and   being identified.the rectangular image of R1,1 in a cylinder RS1 as shown in figure 2.2. It was provenby Luscher and Mack 91 that correlation functions of a conformal field theory CFTon R1,1 can be analytically continued to the entire cylinder.As we saw in section 2.1, the global conformal symmetry of R1,1 is SO2, 2, whichis generated by the 6 conformal Killing vectors , u, u2. The translations alongthe cylinder R S1 are expressed as their linear combinations u 1  u2u. 2.12In the standard form of SO2, 2 generators, Jab, given in section 2.1, they correspondto J03 and J12, and generate the maximally compact subgroup SO2  SO2 ofSO2, 2. R1,p with p  2It is straightforward to extend the above analysis to higher dimensional Minkowskispaceds2  dt2  dr2  r2d2p1, 2.13where dp1 is the line element on the unit sphere Sp1. A series of coordinate changestransforms this asds2  dudu 14u  u2d2p1 , u  t r381cos2 u cos2 ududu 14sin2u  ud2p1, u  tan u14 cos2 u cos2 ud 2  d2  sin2 d2p1, u    2. 2.14rconsttconstFigure 2.3 The conformal transformation maps the t, r half plane into a triangularregion in the ,  plane.As shown in figure 2.3, the t, r halfplane for a fixed point on Sp1 is mappedinto a triangular region in the ,  plane. The conformally scaled metricds2  d 2  d2  sin2 d2p1 2.15can be analytically continued outside of the triangle, and the maximally extended spacewith0    ,     , 2.16has the geometry of R Sp Einstein static universe, where   0 and  correspondsto the north and south poles of Sp. This is a natural generalization of the conformalembedding of R1,1 into R S1 that we saw in the p  1 case.Since121  u2u121  u2u, 2.17the generator H of the global time translation on R  Sp is identified with the linearcombinationH 12P0 K0  J0,p2, 2.1839where P0 and K0 are translation and special conformal generators,P0 12uu, K0 12u2u u2u2.19on R1,p defined in section 2.1. The generator H  J0,p2 corresponds to the SO2part of the maximally compact subgroup SO2  SOp  1 of SO2, p  1. Thusthe subgroup SO2SOp1 or to be precise its universal cover of the conformalgroup SO2, p 1 can be identified with the isometry of the Einstein static universeR Sp. The existence of the generator H also guarantees that a correlation functionof a CFT on R1,p can be analytically extended to the entire Einstein static universeR Sp. 8 8Figure 2.4 AdSp2 is realized as a hyperboloid in R2,p1. The hyperboloid has closedtimelike curves along the  direction. To obtain a causal space, we need to unwrap thecircle to obtain a simply connected space.Antide Sitter SpaceThe p  2dimensional antide Sitter space AdSp2 can be represented as the hyperboloidX20 X2p2 p1i1X2i  R2, 2.20in the flat p 3dimensional space with metricds2  dX20  dX2p2 p1i1dX2i . 2.21By construction, the space has the isometry SO2, p 1, and it is homogeneous andisotropic.40Equation 2.20 can be solved by settingX0  R cosh  cos , Xp2  R cosh  sin ,Xi  R sinh  i i  1,    , p 1i2i  1. 2.22Substituting this into 2.21, we obtain the metric on AdSp2 asds2  R2 cosh2  d 2  d2  sinh2  d2. 2.23By taking 0   and 0    2 the solution 2.22 covers the entire hyperboloid once.Therefore, , ,i are called the global coordinates of AdS. Since the metric behavesnear   0 as ds2  R2d 2  d2  2 d2, the hyperboloid has the topology ofS1  Rp1, with S1 representing closed timelike curves in the  direction. To obtain acausal spacetime, we can simply unwrap the circle S1 i.e. take      withno identifications and obtain the universal covering of the hyperboloid without closedtimelike curves. In this paper, when we refer to AdSp2, we only consider this universalcovering space.The isometry group SO2, p  1 of AdSp2 has the maximal compact subgroupSO2  SOp  1. From the above construction, it is clear that the SO2 partrepresents the constant translation in the  direction, and the SOp1 gives rotationsof Sp.S202Figure 2.5 AdS3 can be conformally mapped into one half of the Einstein static universeR S2.To study the causal structure of AdSp2, it is convenient to introduce a coordinate41 related to  by tan   sinh  0    2. The metric 2.23 then takes the formds2 R2cos2 d 2  d2  sin2  d2. 2.24The causal structure of the spacetime does not change by a conformal rescaling on themetric. Multiplying the metric by R2 cos2 , it becomesds2  d 2  d2  sin2  d2. 2.25This is the metric of the Einstein static universe, which also appeared, with the dimension lower by one, in the conformal compactification of R1,p 2.15. This time, however,the coordinate  takes values in 0    2, rather than 0     in 2.15. Namely,AdSp2 can be conformally mapped into one half of the Einstein static universe thespacelike hypersurface of constant  is a p1dimensional hemisphere. The equatorat   2 is a boundary of the space with the topology of Sp, as shown in figure 2.5in the case of p  1. In the case of AdS2, the coordinate  ranges 2    2since S0 consists of two points. As in the case of the flat space discussed earlier, theconformal compactification is a convenient way to describe the asymptotic regions ofAdS. In general, if a spacetime can be conformally compactified into a region which hasthe same boundary structure as one half of the Einstein static universe, the spacetimeis called asymptotically AdS.Since the boundary extends in the timelike direction labeled by  , we need to specifya boundary condition on the R Sp at   2 in order to make the Cauchy problemwellposed on AdS 98. It turns out that the boundary of AdSp2, or to be precise theboundary of the conformally compactified AdSp2, is identical to the conformal compactification of the p 1dimensional Minkowski space. This fact plays an essentialrole in the AdSp2CFTp1 correspondence.In addition to the global parametrization 2.22 of AdS, there is another set ofcoordinates u, t, x 0  u, x  Rp which will be useful later. It is defined byX0 12u1  u2R2  x 2  t2, Xp2  Rut,X i  Ruxi i  1,    , p,Xp1 12u1 u2R2  x 2  t2. 2.26These coordinates cover one half of the hyperboloid 2.20, as shown in figure 2.6 inthe case of p  0. Substituting this into 2.21, we obtain another form of the AdSp2metricds2  R2du2u2 u2dt2  dx 2. 2.2742uconst2uu08  2Figure 2.6 AdS2 can be conformally mapped into R 2, 2. The u, t coordinates cover the triangular region.The coordinates u, t, x are called the Poincare coordinates. In this form of the metric,the subgroups ISO1, p and SO1, 1 of the SO2, p1 isometry are manifest, whereISO1, p is the Poincare transformation on t, x and SO1, 1 ist, x, u  ct, cx, c1u, c  0. 2.28In the AdSCFT correspondence, this is identified with the dilatation D in the conformal symmetry group of R1,p.It is useful to compare the two expressions, 2.23 and 2.27, for the metric ofAdSp2. In 2.23, the norm of the timelike Killing vector  is everywhere nonzero.In particular, it has a constant norm in the conformally rescaled metric 2.24. For thisreason,  is called the global time coordinate of AdS. On the other hand, the timelikeKilling vector t in 2.27 becomes null at u  0 Killing horizon, as depicted in figure2.7 in the AdS2 case.Euclidean RotationSince AdSp2 has the global time coordinate  and the metric 2.23 is static withrespect to  , quantum field theory on AdSp2 with an appropriate boundary conditionat spatial infinity allows the Wick rotation in  , eiH  eEH . From 2.22, onefinds that the Wick rotation   E  i is expressed in the original coordinates43u0t22Figure 2.7 The timelike Killing vector t is depicted in the AdS2 case. The vector tbecomes a null vector at u  0.X0, X,Xp2 on the hyperboloid as Xp2  XE  iXp2, and the space becomesX20 X2E  X2  R2,ds2E  dX20  dX2E  d X2. 2.29We should point out that the same space is obtained by rotating the time coordinatet of the Poincare coordinates 2.26 as t  tE  it, even though the Poincarecoordinates cover only a part of the entire AdS half of the hyperboloid. This isanalogous to the wellknown fact in flat Minkowski space that the Euclidean rotation ofthe time coordinate t in the Rindler space ds2  r2dt2  dr2 gives the flat Euclideanplane R2, even though the Rindler coordinates t, r cover only a 14 of the entireMinkowski space R1,1.In the coordinates , E , p and u, tE, x, the Euclidean metric is expressed asds2E  R2cosh2  d 2E  d2  sinh2  d2p R2du2u2 u2dt2E  dx2. 2.30In the following, we also use another, trivially equivalent, form of the metric, obtainedfrom the above by setting u  1y in 2.30, givingds2  R2dy2  dx21     dx2p1y2. 2.3144Re zdzdz Im z28uuconstu0Figure 2.8 The Euclidean AdS2 is the upper half plane with the Poincare metric. Itcan be mapped into a disk, where the infinity of the upper half plane is mapped to apoint on the boundary of the disk.The Euclidean AdSp2 is useful for various practical computations in field theory.For theories on flat space, it is wellknown that correlation functions 1   n of fieldson the Euclidean space are related, by the Wick rotation, to the T ordered correlationfunctions 0T 1   n0 in the Minkowski space. The same is true in the antideSitter space if the theory has a positive definite Hamiltonian with respect to the globaltime coordinate  . Green functions of free fields on AdSp2 have been computed in99, 100 using this method.The Euclidean AdSp2 can be mapped into a p2dimensional disk. In the coordinates u, tE, x, u   is the sphere Sp1 at the boundary with one point removed. Thefull boundary sphere is recovered by adding a point corresponding to u  0 or equivalently x  . This is shown in figure 2.8 in the case of AdS2, for which z  tE  iugives a complex coordinate on the upperhalf plane. By adding a point at infinity, theupperhalf plane is compactified into a disk. In the Lorentzian case, u  0 representedthe Killing horizon giving the boundary of the u, t, x coordinates. Since the u  0plane is null in the Lorentzian case, it shrinks to a point in the Euclidean case.2.2.2 Particles and Fields in Antide Sitter SpaceMassive particles, moving along geodesics, can never get to the boundary of AdS. Onthe other hand, since the Penrose diagram of AdS is a cylinder, light rays can go to theboundary and back in finite time, as observed by an observer moving along a geodesicin AdS. More precisely, the light ray will reflect if suitable boundary conditions are set45for the fields propagating in AdS.Let us first consider the case of a scalar field propagating in AdSp2. The fieldequation m2  0 2.32has stationary wave solutions  eiGYlp, 2.33where Ylp is a spherical harmonic, which is an eigenstate of the Laplacian on Spwith an eigenvalue ll  p 1, and G is given by the hypergeometric functionG  sin lcos  2F1 a, b, c sin  , 2.34witha 12l    R,b 12l    R,c  l 12p 1, 2.35and 12p 1 12p 12  4mR2. 2.36The energymomentum tensorT  2 g2 m22 gDD R2 2.37is conserved for any constant value of . The value of  is determined by the couplingof the scalar curvature to 2, which on AdS has the same effect as the mass term inthe wave equation 2.32. The choice of  for each scalar field depends on the theorywe are considering. The total energy E of the scalar field fluctuation,E dp1xgT 00 , 2.38is conserved only if the energymomentum flux through the boundary at   2vanishes, SpdpgniTi02  0. 2.39This requirement reduces to the boundary conditiontan p 1 2  2 tan 2  0   2. 2.4046Going back to the stationary wave solution 2.34, this is satisfied if and only if eithera or b in 2.34 is an integer. If we require the energy  to be real, we findR    l  2n, n  0, 1, 2,   . 2.41This is possible only when  defined by 2.36 is real. Consequently, the mass isbounded from below as14p 12  m2R2. 2.42This is known as the BreitenlohnerFreedman bound 101, 102. Note that a negativemass2 is allowed to a certain extent. The Compton wavelength for these possibletachyons is comparable to the curvature radius of AdS. If m2  p 1p 34R2,we should choose  in 2.41 since this solution is normalizable while the solutionwith  is not. If m2  p1p34R2, both solutions are normalizable and thereare two different quantizations of the scalar field on AdS space. Which quantization tochoose is often determined by requiring symmetry. See 102, 103, 104 for discussions ofboundary conditions in supersymmetric theories. In general, all solutions to the waveequation form a single SO2, p 1 highest weight representation. The highest weightstate is the lowest energy solution 105. Since SO2, p1 acts on AdS as isometries,the action of its generators on the solutions is given by first order differential operators.2.2.3 Supersymmetry in Antide Sitter SpaceThe SO2, p1 isometry group of AdSp2 has a supersymmetric generalization calledan AdS supergroup. To understand the supersymmetry on AdS, it would be useful tostart with the simple supergravity with a cosmological constant . In four dimensions,for example, the action of the N  1 theory is 106S d4xgR 2  125D, 2.43whereD  D i23 2.44and D is the standard covariant derivative. The local supersymmetry transformationrules for the vierbein Va and the gravitino  areVa  ixa,  Dx. 2.45A global supersymmetry of a given supergravity background is determined by requiring that the gravitino variation is annihilated,   0. The resulting condition47on x,D D i23   0, 2.46is known as the Killing spinor equation. The integrability of this equation requiresD, D  12R 23  0, 2.47where 12,. 2.48Since AdS is maximally symmetric, the curvature obeysR 1R2gg  gg , 2.49where R is the size of the hyperboloid defined by 2.20. Thus, if we choose thecurvature of AdS to be   3R2 this is necessary for AdS to be a classical solution of2.43, the integrability condition 2.47 is obeyed for any spinor . Since the Killingspinor equation 2.46 is a first order equation, this means that there are as manysolutions to the equation as the number of independent components of the spinor.Namely, AdS preserves as many supersymmetries as flat space.The existence of supersymmetry implies that, with an appropriate set of boundaryconditions, the supergravity theory on AdS is stable with its energy bounded frombelow. The supergravity theories on AdS typically contains scalar fields with negativemass2. However they all satisfy the bound 2.42 104, 107. The issue of the boundarycondition and supersymmetry in AdS was further studied in 103. A nonperturbativeproof of the stability of AdS is given in 108, based on a generalization of Wittensproof 109 of the positive energy theorem in flat space 110.2.2.4 Gauged Supergravities and KaluzaKlein CompactificationsExtended supersymmetries in AdSp2 with p  2, 3, 4, 5 are classified by Nahm 92see also 111 asAdS4  OSpN4, N  1, 2,   AdS5  SU2, 2N 2, N  2, 4, 6, 8AdS6  F 4AdS7  OSp6, 2N , N  2, 4. 2.5048For AdSp2 with p  5, there is no simple AdS supergroup. These extended supersymmetries are realized as global symmetries of gauged supergravity on AdSp2. TheAdSCFT correspondence identifies them with the superconformal algebras discussedin section 2.1.3. Gauged supergravities are supergravity theories with nonabeliangauge fields in the supermultiplet of the graviton. Typically the cosmological constantis negative and AdSp2 is a natural background geometry. Many of them are relatedto KaluzaKlein compactification of the supergravities in 10 and 11 dimensions. Acomplete catalogue of gauged supergravities in dimensions  11 is found in 21. Herewe list some of them. AdS7The gauged supergravity in 7 dimensions has global supersymmetry OSp6, 2N .The maximally supersymmetric case of N  4 constructed in 112 contains a YangMills field with a gauge group Sp2  SO5. The field content of this theory can bederived from a truncation of the spectrum of the KaluzaKlein compactification of the11dimensional supergravity to 7 dimensions,R11  AdS7  S4. 2.51The 11dimensional supergravity has the LagrangianL  g14R 148FF172A  F  F  fermions, 2.52where A is a 3form gauge field and F  dA. It was pointed out by Freund and Rubin113 that there is a natural way to compactify the theory to 4 or 7 dimensions. Wehave put the word compactify in quotes since we will see that typically the size ofthe compact dimensions is comparable to the radius of curvature of the noncompactdimensions. To compactify the theory to 7 dimensions, the ansatz of Freund andRubin sets the 4form field strength F to be proportional to the volume element on a4dimensional subspace M4. The Einstein equation, which includes the contribution ofF to the energymomentum tensor, implies a positive curvature on M4 and a constantnegative curvature on the noncompact dimensions, i.e. they are AdS7.The maximally symmetric case is obtained by considering M4  S4. Since there isno cosmological constant in 11 dimensions, the radius R of S4 is proportional to thecurvature radius of AdS7. By the KaluzaKlein mechanism, the SO5 isometry of S4becomes the gauge symmetry in 7 dimensions. The spherical harmonics on S4 givean infinite tower of KaluzaKlein particles on AdS7. A truncation of this spectrumto include only the graviton supermultiplet gives the spectrum of the N  4 SO5gauged supergravity on AdS7. It has been believed that this is a consistent truncationof the full theory, and very recently it was shown in 114 that this is indeed the case.In general, there are subtleties in the consistent truncation procedure, which will be49discussed in more detail in the next subsection. There are also other N  4 theorieswith noncompact gauge groups SOp, q with p  q  5 115.The seven dimensional N  2 gauged supergravity with gauge group Sp1  SU2was constructed in 116. In this case, one can have also a matter theory with possiblyanother gauge group G. It is not known whether a matter theory of arbitrary Gwith arbitrary coupling constant can be coupled to gauged supergravity. The KaluzaKlein compactification of 10dimensional N  1 supergravity, coupled to N  1 superYangMills, on S3 gives a particular example. In this case, ten dimensional anomalycancellation requires particular choices of G. AdS6The 6dimensional antide Sitter supergroup F 4 is realized by the N  4 gaugedsupergravity with gauge group SU2. It was predicted to exist in 117 and constructedin 118. It was conjectured in 119 to be related to a compactification of the tendimensional massive type IIA supergravity theory. The relevant compactification ofthe massive type IIA supergravity is constructed as a fibration of AdS6 over S4 120.The form of the ten dimensional space is called a warped product 121 and it is themost general one that has the AdS isometry group 122. The SU2 gauge group ofthe 6dimensional N  4 gauged supergravity is associated with an SU2 subgroupof the SO4 isometry group of the compact part of the ten dimensional space. AdS5In 5 dimensions, there are N  2, 4, 6 and 8 gauged supergravities with supersymmetry SU2, 2N 2. The gauged N  8 supergravity was constructed in 123, 124. Ithas the gauge group SU4  SO6 and the global symmetry E6. This theory can bederived by a truncation of the compactification of 10dimensional type IIB supergravityon S5 using the FreundRubin ansatz, i.e. setting the selfdual 5form field strengthF 5 to be proportional to the volume form of S5 125, 85, 126. By the Einstein equation, the strength of F 5 determines the radius of S5 and the cosmological constantR2 of AdS5.This case is of particular interest as we will see below, the AdSCFT correspondenceclaims that it is dual to the large N and large g2YMN limit of N  4 supersymmetricSUN gauge theory in four dimensions. The complete KaluzaKlein mass spectrumof the IIB supergravity theory on AdS5  S5 was obtained in 85, 126. One of theinteresting features of the KaluzaKlein spectrum in this case as well as in the othercases discussed in this section is that the frequency  of stationary wave solutions isquantized. For example, the masses of the scalar fields in the KaluzaKlein tower areall of the form mR2  ll4, where l is an integer bounded from below. Substitutingthis into 2.36 with p  3, we obtain  2 l  2. 2.5350Therefore, the frequency  given by 2.41 takes values in integer multiples of 1RR  2 l  2 l  2n, n  0, 1, 2,   . 2.54This means that all the scalar fields in the supergravity multiplet are periodic in with the period 2, i.e. the scalar fields are singlevalued on the original hyperboloid2.20 before taking the universal covering. This applies to all other fields in thesupermultiplet as well, with the fermions obeying the Ramond boundary conditionaround the timelike circle.The fact that the frequency  is quantized has its origin in supersymmetry. Thesupergravity particles in 10 dimensions are BPS objects and preserve one half of thesupersymmetry. This property is preserved under the KaluzaKlein compactificationon S5. The notion of the BPS particles in the case of AdS supergravity is clarified in127 and it is shown, in the context of theories in 4 dimensions, that it leads to thequantization of . In the AdSCFT correspondence, this is dual to the fact that chiralprimary operators do not have anomalous dimensions.On the other hand, energy levels of other states, such as stringy states or black holes,are not expected to be quantized as the supergravity modes are. Thus, the full stringtheory does not make sense on the hyperboloid but only on its universal cover withoutthe closed timelike curve.The N  4 gauged supergravity with gauge group SU2U1 was constructed in128. Various N  2 theories were constructed in 129, 130, 131, 132. AdS4In four dimensions, some of the possible AdS supergroups are OSpN4 with N 1, 2, 4 and 8. N  8 is the maximal supergroup that corresponds to a supergravitytheory. The N  8 gauged supergravity with SO8 gauge group was constructed in133, 134. This theory like the other theories discussed in this section has a highlynontrivial potential for scalar fields, whose extrema were analyzed in 135, 136. Itwas shown in 137 that the extremum with N  8 supersymmetry corresponds toa truncation of the compactification of 11dimensional supergravity on AdS4  S7.Some of the other extrema can also be identified with truncations of compactificationsof the 11dimensional theory. For a review of the 4dimensional compactifications of11dimensional supergravity, see 22. AdS3Nahms classification does not include this case since the isometry group SO2, 2 ofAdS3 is not a simple group but rather the direct product of two SL2,R factors. Thesupergravity theories associated with the AdS3 supergroups OSpp2OSpq2 wereconstructed in 138 and studied more recently in 139. They can be regarded as theChernSimons gauge theories of gauge group OSpp2  OSpq2. Therefore, they51are topological field theories without local degrees of freedom. The case of p  q  3is obtained, for example, by a truncation of the KaluzaKlein compactification of the6dimensional N  2, 0 supergravity on S3. In addition to OSpp2, several othersupersymmetric extensions of SL2,R are known, such asSUN1, 1, G3, F 4, D2, 1, . 2.55Their representations are studied extensively in the context of twodimensional superconformal field theories.2.2.5 Consistent Truncation of KaluzaKlein CompactificationsDespite the fact that the equations of motion for type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions are known, it turns out to be difficult to extract any simple form for the equationsof motion of fluctuations around its fivedimensional KaluzaKlein compactification onS5. The spectrum of this compactification is known from the work of 126, 85. It isa general feature of compactifications involving antide Sitter space that the positivelycurved compact part has a radius of curvature on the same order as the negativelycurved antide Sitter part. As a result, the positive mass2 of KaluzaKlein modes isof the same order as the negative mass2 of tachyonic modes. Thus there is no lowenergy limit in which one can argue that all but finitely many KaluzaKlein harmonicsdecouple. This was a traditional worry for all compactifications of elevendimensionalsupergravity on squashed sevenspheres.However, fairly compelling evidence exists 140 and references therein that thereduction of elevendimensional supergravity on S7 can be consistently truncated tofourdimensional N  8 gauged supergravity. This is an exact statement about theequations of motion, and does not rely in any way on taking a lowenergy limit. Putsimply, it means that any solution of the truncated theory can be lifted to a solution ofthe untruncated theory. Charged black hole metrics in antide Sitter space provide anontrivial example of solutions that can be lifted to the higherdimensional theory 141,142, 143. There is a belief but no proof that a similar truncation may be made from tendimensional type IIB supergravity on S5 to fivedimensional N  8 supergravity. Toillustrate how radical a truncation this is, we indicate in figure 2.9 the fivedimensionalscalars that are kept this is a part of one of the figures in 126. Note that notall of them are SO6 singlets. Indeed, the fields which are kept are precisely thesuperpartners of the massless graviton under the supergroup SU2, 24, which includesSO6 as its Rsymmetry group.The historical route to gauged supergravities was as an elaboration of the ungaugedtheories, and only after the fact were they argued to be related to the KaluzaKleinreduction of higher dimensional theories on positively curved manifolds. In ungauged52430201 4510 50105kCCCB a h   amFigure 2.9 The lowlying scalar fields in the KaluzaKlein reduction of type IIB supergravity on S5. The filled dots indicate fields which are kept in the truncation togauged supergravity. We also indicate schematically the tendimensional origin of thescalars.d  5 N  8 supergravity, the scalars parametrize the coset E66USp8 following144 we use here USp8 to denote the unitary version of the symplectic group with afourdimensional Cartan subalgebra. The spectrum of gauged supergravity is almostthe same the only difference is that twelve of the vector fields are dualized into antisymmetric twoforms. Schematically, we write this asg a Aab abc abcd1 8 27 48 42A IJ BI15 12 2.56Lowercase Roman indices are the eightvalued indices of the fundamental of USp8.Multiple USp8 indices in 2.56 are antisymmetrized and the symplectic trace partsremoved. The uppercase Roman indices I, J are the sixvalued indices of the vectorrepresentation of SO6, while the index  indicates a doublet of the SL2,R whichdescends directly from the SL2,R global symmetry of type IIB supergravity. Thesegroups are embedded into E66 via the chainE66  SL6,R SL2,R  SO6 SL2,R . 2.57The key step in formulating gauged supergravities is to introduce minimal gaugecouplings into the Lagrangian for all fields which are charged under the subgroup ofthe global symmetry group that is to be gauged. For instance, if XI is a scalar field inthe vector representation of SO6, one makes the replacementXI  DXI  XI  gA IJXJ 2.5853everywhere in the ungauged action. The gauge coupling g has dimensions of energyin five dimensions, and one can eventually show that g  2R where R is the radiusof the S5 in the AdS5  S5 geometry. The replacement 2.58 spoils supersymmetry,but it was shown in 124, 123 that a supersymmetric Lagrangian can be recoveredby adding terms at Og and Og2. The full Lagrangian and the supersymmetrytransformations can be found in these references. It is a highly nontrivial claim thatthis action, with its beautiful nonpolynomial structure in the scalar fields, representsa consistent truncation of the reduction of type IIB supergravity on S5. This is notentirely implausible, in view of the fact that the SO6 isometry of the S5 becomesthe local gauge symmetry of the truncated theory. Trivial examples of consistenttruncation include situations where one restricts to fields which are invariant undersome subgroup of the gauge group. For instance, the part of N  8 fivedimensionalsupergravity invariant under a particular SU2  SO6 isN  4 gauged supergravitycoupled to two tensor multiplets 145. A similar trunction to N  6 supergravity wasconsidered in 146.The Og2 term in the Lagrangian is particularly interesting it is a potential Vfor the scalars. V is an SO6  SL2,R invariant function on the coset manifoldE66USp8. It involves all the 42 scalars except the dilaton and the axion. Roughlyspeaking, one can think of the 40 remaining scalars as parametrizing a restricted classof deformations of the metric and 3form fields on the S5, and of V as measuring theresponse of type IIB supergravity to these deformations. If the scalars are frozen to anextremum of V , then the value of the potential sets the cosmological constant in fivedimensions. The associated conformal field theories were discussed in 147, 148, 149.The known extrema can be classified by the subset of the SO6 global Rsymmetrygroup that is preserved.54Chapter 3AdSCFT Correspondence3.1 The CorrespondenceIn this section we will present an argument connecting type IIB string theory compactified on AdS5  S5 to N  4 superYangMills theory 5. Let us start with type IIBstring theory in flat, ten dimensional Minkowski space. Consider N parallel D3 branesthat are sitting together or very close to each other the precise meaning of very closewill be defined below. The D3 branes are extended along a 3  1 dimensional planein 91 dimensional spacetime. String theory on this background contains two kindsof perturbative excitations, closed strings and open strings. The closed strings are theexcitations of empty space and the open strings end on the Dbranes and describe excitations of the Dbranes. If we consider the system at low energies, energies lower thanthe string scale 1ls, then only the massless string states can be excited, and we canwrite an effective Lagrangian describing their interactions. The closed string masslessstates give a gravity supermultiplet in ten dimensions, and their lowenergy effectiveLagrangian is that of type IIB supergravity. The open string massless states give anN  4 vector supermultiplet in 3  1 dimensions, and their lowenergy effectiveLagrangian is that of N  4 UN superYangMills theory 9, 2.The complete effective action of the massless modes will have the formS  Sbulk  Sbrane  Sint. 3.1Sbulk is the action of ten dimensional supergravity, plus some higher derivative corrections. Note that the Lagrangian 3.1 involves only the massless fields but it takesinto account the effects of integrating out the massive fields. It is not renormalizableeven for the fields on the brane, and it should only be understood as an effectivedescription in the Wilsonian sense, i.e. we integrate out all massive degrees of freedombut we do not integrate out the massless ones. The brane action Sbrane is defined onthe 3  1 dimensional brane worldvolume, and it contains the N  4 superYang55Mills Lagrangian plus some higher derivative corrections, for example terms of theform 2TrF 4. Finally, Sint describes the interactions between the brane modes andthe bulk modes. The leading terms in this interaction Lagrangian can be obtained bycovariantizing the brane action, introducing the background metric for the brane 150.We can expand the bulk action as a free quadratic part describing the propagationof free massless modes including the graviton, plus some interactions which are proportional to positive powers of the square root of the Newton constant. Schematicallywe haveSbulk 122 gR h2  h2h    , 3.2where we have written the metric as g  h. We indicate explicitly the dependenceon the graviton, but the other terms in the Lagrangian, involving other fields, can beexpanded in a similar way. Similarly, the interaction Lagrangian Sint is proportional topositive powers of . If we take the low energy limit, all interaction terms proportionalto  drop out. This is the well known fact that gravity becomes free at long distanceslow energies.In order to see more clearly what happens in this low energy limit it is convenientto keep the energy fixed and send ls  0   0 keeping all the dimensionlessparameters fixed, including the string coupling constant and N . In this limit thecoupling   gs2  0, so that the interaction Lagrangian relating the bulk and thebrane vanishes. In addition all the higher derivative terms in the brane action vanish,leaving just the pure N  4 UN gauge theory in 3  1 dimensions, which is knownto be a conformal field theory. And, the supergravity theory in the bulk becomes free.So, in this low energy limit we have two decoupled systems. On the one hand we havefree gravity in the bulk and on the other hand we have the four dimensional gaugetheory.Next, we consider the same system from a different point of view. Dbranes aremassive charged objects which act as a source for the various supergravity fields. Asshown in section 1.3 we can find a D3 brane solution 58 of supergravity, of the formds2  f12dt2  dx21  dx22  dx23  f 12dr2  r2d25 ,F5  1  dtdx1dx2dx3df1 ,f  1 R4r4, R4  4gs2N .3.3Note that since gtt is nonconstant, the energy Ep of an object as measured by anobserver at a constant position r and the energy E measured by an observer at infinityare related by the redshift factorE  f14Ep . 3.456This means that the same object brought closer and closer to r  0 would appear tohave lower and lower energy for the observer at infinity. Now we take the low energylimit in the background described by equation 3.3. There are two kinds of low energyexcitations from the point of view of an observer at infinity. We can have masslessparticles propagating in the bulk region with wavelengths that becomes very large, orwe can have any kind of excitation that we bring closer and closer to r  0. In thelow energy limit these two types of excitations decouple from each other. The bulkmassless particles decouple from the near horizon region around r  0 because thelow energy absorption cross section goes like   3R8 10, 11, where  is the energy.This can be understood from the fact that in this limit the wavelength of the particlebecomes much bigger than the typical gravitational size of the brane which is of orderR. Similarly, the excitations that live very close to r  0 find it harder and harder toclimb the gravitational potential and escape to the asymptotic region. In conclusion,the low energy theory consists of two decoupled pieces, one is free bulk supergravityand the second is the near horizon region of the geometry. In the near horizon region,r  R, we can approximate f  R4r4, and the geometry becomesds2 r2R2dt2  dx21  dx22  dx23 R2dr2r2R2d25, 3.5which is the geometry of AdS5  S5.We see that both from the point of view of a field theory of open strings livingon the brane, and from the point of view of the supergravity description, we havetwo decoupled theories in the lowenergy limit. In both cases one of the decoupledsystems is supergravity in flat space. So, it is natural to identify the second systemwhich appears in both descriptions. Thus, we are led to the conjecture that N  4UN superYangMills theory in 31 dimensions is the same as or dual to type IIBsuperstring theory on AdS5  S5 5.We could be a bit more precise about the near horizon limit and how it is beingtaken. Suppose that we take   0, as we did when we discussed the field theoryliving on the brane. We want to keep fixed the energies of the objects in the throatthe nearhorizon region in string units, so that we can consider arbitrary excitedstring states there. This implies thatEp  fixed. For small  3.4 reduces toE  Epr. Since we want to keep fixed the energy measured from infinity, whichis the way energies are measured in the field theory, we need to take r  0 keepingr fixed. It is then convenient to define a new variable U  r, so that the metricbecomesds2  U24gsNdt2  dx21  dx22  dx23 4gsNdU2U24gsNd25. 3.6This can also be seen by considering a D3 brane sitting at r. As discussed in section571.3 this corresponds to giving a vacuum expectation value to one of the scalars in theYangMills theory. When we take the   0 limit we want to keep the mass of theW boson fixed. This mass, which is the mass of the string stretching between thebranes sitting at r  0 and the one at r, is proportional to U  r, so this quantityshould remain fixed in the decoupling limit.A UN gauge theory is essentially equivalent to a free U1 vector multiplet timesan SUN gauge theory, up to some ZN identifications which affect only global issues.In the dual string theory all modes interact with gravity, so there are no decoupledmodes. Therefore, the bulk AdS theory is describing the SUN part of the gaugetheory. In fact we were not precise when we said that there were two sets of excitationsat low energies, the excitations in the asymptotic flat space and the excitations inthe near horizon region. There are also some zero modes which live in the regionconnecting the throat the near horizon region with the bulk, which correspond tothe U1 degrees of freedom mentioned above. The U1 vector supermultiplet includessix scalars which are related to the center of mass motion of all the branes 151. Fromthe AdS point of view these zero modes live at the boundary, and it looks like we mightor might not decide to include them in the AdS theory. Depending on this choice wecould have a correspondence to an SUN or a UN theory. The U1 center of massdegree of freedom is related to the topological theory of Bfields on AdS 152 if oneimposes local boundary conditions for these Bfields at the boundary of AdS one findsa U1 gauge field living at the boundary 153, as is familiar in ChernSimons theories25, 154. These modes living at the boundary are sometimes called singletons ordoubletons 155, 127, 156, 87, 88, 157, 158, 159, 160.As we saw in section 2.2, AntideSitter space has a large group of isometries, whichis SO4, 2 for the case at hand. This is the same group as the conformal group in 31dimensions. Thus, the fact that the lowenergy field theory on the brane is conformalis reflected in the fact that the near horizon geometry is AntideSitter space. We alsohave some supersymmetries. The number of supersymmetries is twice that of the fullsolution 3.3 containing the asymptotic region 151. This doubling of supersymmetriesis viewed in the field theory as a consequence of superconformal invariance section2.2.3, since the superconformal algebra has twice as many fermionic generators as thecorresponding Poincare superalgebra. We also have an SO6 symmetry which rotatesthe S5. This can be identified with the SU4R Rsymmetry group of the field theory.In fact, the whole supergroup is the same for the N  4 field theory and the AdS5S5geometry, so both sides of the conjecture have the same spacetime symmetries. Wewill discuss in more detail the matching between the two sides of the correspondencein section 3.2.In the above derivation the field theory is naturally defined on R3,1, but we sawin section 2.2.1 that we could also think of the conformal field theory as defined on58S3  R by redefining the Hamiltonian. Since the isometries of AdS are in one toone correspondence with the generators of the conformal group of the field theory, wecan conclude that this new Hamiltonian 12P0 K0 can be associated on AdS to thegenerator of translations in global time. This formulation of the conjecture is moreuseful since in the global coordinates there is no horizon. When we put the field theoryon S3 the Coulomb branch is lifted and there is a unique ground state. This is dueto the fact that the scalars I in the field theory are conformally coupled, so there isa term of the formd4xTr2R in the Lagrangian, where R is the curvature of thefourdimensional space on which the theory is defined. Due to the positive curvatureof S3 this leads to a mass term for the scalars 20, lifting the moduli space.The parameter N appears on the string theory side as the flux of the fiveformRamondRamond field strength on the S5,S5F5  N. 3.7From the physics of Dbranes we know that the YangMills coupling is related to thestring coupling through 6, 161  4ig2YM2igs2, 3.8where we have also included the relationship of the  angle to the expectation valueof the RR scalar . We have written the couplings in this fashion because both thegauge theory and the string theory have an SL2,Z selfduality symmetry under which  a  bc  d where a, b, c, d are integers with ad bc  1. In fact, SL2,Zis a conjectured strongweak coupling duality symmetry of type IIB string theory inflat space 162, and it should also be a symmetry in the present context since all thefields that are being turned on in the AdS5  S5 background the metric and the fiveform field strength are invariant under this symmetry. The connection between theSL2,Z duality symmetries of type IIB string theory and N  4 SYM was noted in163, 164, 165. The string theory seems to have a parameter that does not appearin the gauge theory, namely , which sets the string tension and all other scales inthe string theory. However, this is not really a parameter in the theory if we do notcompare it to other scales in the theory, since only relative scales are meaningful. Infact, only the ratio of the radius of curvature to  is a parameter, but not  andthe radius of curvature independently. Thus,  will disappear from any final physicalquantity we compute in this theory. It is sometimes convenient, especially when one isdoing gravity calculations, to set the radius of curvature to one. This can be achievedby writing the metric as ds2  R2ds2, and rewriting everything in terms of g. Withthese conventions GN  1N2 and   1gsN . This implies that any quantitycalculated purely in terms of the gravity solution, without including stringy effects,59will be independent of gsN and will depend only on N .  corrections to the gravityresults give corrections which are proportional to powers of 1gsN .Now, let us address the question of the validity of various approximations. Theanalysis of loop diagrams in the field theory shows that we can trust the perturbativeanalysis in the YangMills theory wheng2YMN  gsN R4l4s 1. 3.9Note that we need g2YMN to be small and not just g2YM . On the other hand, theclassical gravity description becomes reliable when the radius of curvature R of AdSand of S5 becomes large compared to the string length,R4l4s gsN  g2YMN  1. 3.10We see that the gravity regime 3.10 and the perturbative field theory regime 3.9are perfectly incompatible. In this fashion we avoid any obvious contradiction dueto the fact that the two theories look very different. This is the reason that thiscorrespondence is called a duality. The two theories are conjectured to be exactlythe same, but when one side is weakly coupled the other is strongly coupled and viceversa. This makes the correspondence both hard to prove and useful, as we can solvea strongly coupled gauge theory via classical supergravity. Notice that in 3.93.10we implicitly assumed that gs  1. If gs  1 we can perform an SL2,Z dualitytransformation and get conditions similar to 3.93.10 but with gs  1gs. So,we cannot get into the gravity regime 3.10 by taking N small N  1, 2, .. andgs very large, since in that case the Dstring becomes light and renders the gravityapproximation invalid. Another way to see this is to note that the radius of curvaturein Planck units is R4l4p  N . So, it is always necessary, but not sufficient, to havelarge N in order to have a weakly coupled supergravity description.One might wonder why the above argument was not a proof rather than a conjecture.It is not a proof because we did not treat the string theory nonperturbatively noteven nonperturbatively in . We could also consider different forms of the conjecture.In its weakest form the gravity description would be valid for large gsN , but the fullstring theory on AdS might not agree with the field theory. A not so weak form wouldsay that the conjecture is valid even for finite gsN , but only in the N   limitso that the  corrections would agree with the field theory, but the gs correctionsmay not. The strong form of the conjecture, which is the most interesting one andwhich we will assume here, is that the two theories are exactly the same for all valuesof gs and N . In this conjecture the spacetime is only required to be asymptotic toAdS5  S5 as we approach the boundary. In the interior we can have all kinds of60processes gravitons, highly excited fundamental string states, Dbranes, black holes,etc. Even the topology of spacetime can change in the interior. The YangMills theoryis supposed to effectively sum over all spacetimes which are asymptotic to AdS5  S5.This is completely analogous to the usual conditions of asymptotic flatness. We canhave black holes and all kinds of topology changing processes, as long as spacetime isasymptotically flat. In this case asymptotic flatness is replaced by the asymptotic AdSbehavior.3.1.1 Brane Probes and Multicenter SolutionsThe moduli space of vacua of the N  4 UN gauge theory is R6NSN , parametrizing the positions of the N branes in the six dimensional transverse space. In thesupergravity solution one can replacef  Nr4Ni11r  ri4, 3.11and still have a solution to the supergravity equations. We see that if r  ri thenthe two solutions are basically the same, while when we go to r  ri the solution startslooking like the solution of a single brane. Of course, we cannot trust the supergravitysolution for a single brane since the curvature in Planck units is proportional to anegative power of N. What we can do is separate the N branes into groups of Nibranes with gsNi  1 for all i. Then we can trust the gravity solution everywhere.Another possibility is to separate just one brane or a small number of branesfrom a group of N branes. Then we can view this brane as a D3brane in the AdS5background which is generated by the other branes as described above. A stringstretching between the brane probe and the N branes appears in the gravity descriptionas a string stretching between the D3brane and the horizon of AdS. This seems a bitsurprising at first since the proper distance to the horizon is infinite. However, we geta finite result for the energy of this state once we remember to include the redshiftfactor. The D3branes in AdS like any D3branes in string theory are described atlow energies by the BornInfeld action, which is the YangMills action plus some higherderivative corrections. This seems to contradict, at first sight, the fact that the dualfield theory coming from the original branes is just the pure YangMills theory. Inorder to understand this point more precisely let us write explicitly the bosonic part61of the BornInfeld action for a D3 brane in AdS 150,S   123gs2d4xf1  det  frr  r2fgijij  2fF 1,f 4gs2Nr4,3.12where i are angular coordinates on the 5sphere. We can easily check that if we definea new coordinate U  r, then all the  dependence drops out of this action. SinceU which has dimensions of energy corresponds to the mass of the W bosons in thisconfiguration, it is the natural way to express the Higgs expectation value that breaksUN1 to UNU1. In fact, the action 3.12 is precisely the lowenergy effectiveaction in the field theory for the massless U1 degrees of freedom, that we obtain afterintegrating out the massive degrees of freedom W bosons. We can expand 3.12in powers of U and we see that the quadratic term does not have any correction,which is consistent with the nonrenormalization theorem for N  4 superYangMills166. The U4 term has only a oneloop correction, and this is also consistent withanother nonrenormalization theorem 167. This oneloop correction can be evaluatedexplicitly in the gauge theory and the result agrees with the supergravity result 168.It is possible to argue, using broken conformal invariance, that all terms in 3.12 aredetermined by the U4 term 5. Since the massive degrees of freedom that we areintegrating out have a mass proportional to U , the action 3.12 makes sense as longas the energies involved are much smaller than U . In particular, we need UU  U .Since 3.12 has the form LgsNU2U4, the higher order terms in 3.12 couldbecome important in the supergravity regime, when gsN  1. The Born Infeld action3.12, as always, makes sense only when the curvature of the brane is small, but thedeviations from a straight flat brane could be large. In this regime we can keep thenonlinear terms in 3.12 while we still neglect the massive string modes and similareffects. Further gauge theory calculations for effective actions of Dbrane probes include169, 170, 171.3.1.2 The Field  Operator CorrespondenceA conformal field theory does not have asymptotic states or an Smatrix, so the naturalobjects to consider are operators. For example, in N  4 superYangMills we have adeformation by a marginal operator which changes the value of the coupling constant.Changing the coupling constant in the field theory is related by 3.8 to changing thecoupling constant in the string theory, which is then related to the expectation value of62the dilaton. The expectation value of the dilaton is set by the boundary condition forthe dilaton at infinity. So, changing the gauge theory coupling constant correspondsto changing the boundary value of the dilaton. More precisely, let us denote by Othe corresponding operator. We can consider adding the termd4x0xOx to theLagrangian for simplicity we assume that such a term was not present in the originalLagrangian, otherwise we consider 0x to be the total coefficient of Ox in theLagrangian. According to the discussion above, it is natural to assume that thiswill change the boundary condition of the dilaton at the boundary of AdS to in thecoordinate system 2.31 x, zz0  0x. More precisely, as argued in 19, 20, itis natural to propose thated4x0xOxCFT  Zstringx, zz0 0x, 3.13where the left hand side is the generating function of correlation functions in the fieldtheory, i.e. 0 is an arbitrary function and we can calculate correlation functions of Oby taking functional derivatives with respect to 0 and then setting 0  0. The righthand side is the full partition function of string theory with the boundary conditionthat the field  has the value 0 on the boundary of AdS. Notice that 0 is a functionof the four variables parametrizing the boundary of AdS5.A formula like 3.13 is valid in general, for any field . Therefore, each field propagating on AdS space is in a one to one correspondence with an operator in the fieldtheory. There is a relation between the mass of the field  and the scaling dimensionof the operator in the conformal field theory. Let us describe this more generally inAdSd1. The wave equation in Euclidean space for a field of mass m has two independent solutions, which behave like zd and z for small z close to the boundary ofAdS, where d2d24R2m2. 3.14Therefore, in order to get consistent behavior for a massive field, the boundary condition on the field in the right hand side of 3.13 should in general be changed tox,   d0x, 3.15and eventually we would take the limit where   0. Since  is dimensionless, wesee that 0 has dimensions of lengthd which implies, through the left hand sideof 3.13, that the associated operator O has dimension  3.14. A more detailedderivation of this relation will be given in section 3.3, where we will verify that thetwopoint correlation function of the operator O behaves as that of an operator ofdimension  19, 20. A similar relation between fields on AdS and operators in the63field theory exists also for nonscalar fields, including fermions and tensors on AdSspace.Correlation functions in the gauge theory can be computed from 3.13 by differentiating with respect to 0. Each differentiation brings down an insertion O, which sendsa  particle a closed string state into the bulk. Feynman diagrams can be used tocompute the interactions of particles in the bulk. In the limit where classical supergravity is applicable, the only diagrams that contribute are the treelevel diagrams ofthe gravity theory see for instance figure 3.1.Figure 3.1 Correlation functions can be calculated in the large gsN limit in terms ofsupergravity Feynman diagrams. Here we see the leading contribution coming from adisconnected diagram plus connected pieces involving interactions of the supergravityfields in the bulk of AdS. At tree level, these diagrams and those related to them bycrossing are the only ones that contribute to the fourpoint function.This method of defining the correlation functions of a field theory which is dual toa gravity theory in the bulk of AdS space is quite general, and it applies in principleto any theory of gravity 20. Any local field theory contains the stress tensor as anoperator. Since the correspondence described above matches the stressenergy tensorwith the graviton, this implies that the AdS theory includes gravity. It should bea well defined quantum theory of gravity since we should be able to compute loopdiagrams. String theory provides such a theory. But if a new way of defining quantumgravity theories comes along we could consider those gravity theories in AdS, and theyshould correspond to some conformal field theory on the boundary. In particular,we could consider backgrounds of string theory of the form AdS5 M5 where M5 isany Einstein manifold 172, 173, 174. Depending on the choice of M5 we get differentdual conformal field theories, as discussed in section 4.1. Similarly, this discussioncan be extended to any AdSd1 space, corresponding to a conformal field theory in dspacetime dimensions for d  1. We will discuss examples of this in section 6.1.643.1.3 HolographyIn this section we will describe how the AdSCFT correspondence gives a holographicdescription of physics in AdS spaces.Let us start by explaining the Bekenstein bound, which states that the maximumentropy in a region of space is Smax  Area4GN 29, where the area is that of theboundary of the region. Suppose that we had a state with more entropy than Smax,then we show that we could violate the second law of thermodynamics. We can throwin some extra matter such that we form a black hole. The entropy should not decrease.But if a black hole forms inside the region its entropy is just the area of its horizon,which is smaller than the area of the boundary of the region which by our assumptionis smaller than the initial entropy. So, the second law has been violated.Note that this bound implies that the number of degrees of freedom inside someregion grows as the area of the boundary of a region and not like the volume of theregion. In standard quantum field theories this is certainly not possible. Attemptingto understand this behavior leads to the holographic principle, which states that ina quantum gravity theory all physics within some volume can be described in terms ofsome theory on the boundary which has less than one degree of freedom per Planckarea 27, 28 so that its entropy satisfies the Bekenstein bound.In the AdSCFT correspondence we are describing physics in the bulk of AdS spaceby a field theory of one less dimension which can be thought of as living on theboundary, so it looks like holography. However, it is hard to check what the numberof degrees of freedom per Planck area is, since the theory, being conformal, has aninfinite number of degrees of freedom, and the area of the boundary of AdS space isalso infinite. Thus, in order to compare things properly we should introduce a cutoffon the number of degrees of freedom in the field theory and see what it corresponds toin the gravity theory. For this purpose let us write the metric of AdS asds2  R21  r21 r22dt2 41 r22 dr2  r2d2 . 3.16In these coordinates the boundary of AdS is at r  1. We saw above that when wecalculate correlation functions we have to specify boundary conditions at r  1 andthen take the limit of   0. It is clear by studying the action of the conformal groupon Poincare coordinates that the radial position plays the role of some energy scale,since we approach the boundary when we do a conformal transformation that localizesobjects in the CFT. So, the limit   0 corresponds to going to the UV of the fieldtheory. When we are close to the boundary we could also use the Poincare coordinatesds2  R2dt2  dx2  dz2z2, 3.1765in which the boundary is at z  0. If we consider a particle or wave propagatingin 3.17 or 3.16 we see that its motion is independent of R in the supergravityapproximation. Furthermore, if we are in Euclidean space and we have a wave thathas some spatial extent  in the x directions, it will also have an extent  in the zdirection. This can be seen from 3.17 by eliminating  through the change of variablesx x, z  z. This implies that a cutoff atz   3.18corresponds to a UV cutoff in the field theory at distances , with no factors of R here is dimensionless, in the field theory it is measured in terms of the radius of the S4or S3 that the theory lives on. Equation 3.18 is called the UVIR relation 175.Consider the case of N  4 SYM on a threesphere of radius one. We can estimatethe number of degrees of freedom in the field theory with a UV cutoff . We getS  N23, 3.19since the number of cells into which we divide the threesphere is of order 13. In thegravity solution 3.16 the area in Planck units of the surface at r  1 , for   1,isArea4GNVS5R334GN N23. 3.20Thus, we see that the AdSCFT correspondence saturates the holographic bound 175.One could be a little suspicious of the statement that gravity in AdS is holographic,since it does not seem to be saying much because in AdS space the volume and theboundary area of a given region scale in the same fashion as we increase the size ofthe region. In fact, any field theory in AdS would be holographic in the sense thatthe number of degrees of freedom within some large enough volume is proportionalto the area and also to the volume. What makes this case different is that wehave the additional parameter R, and then we can take AdS spaces of different radiicorresponding to different values of N in the SYM theory, and then we can askwhether the number of degrees of freedom goes like the volume or the area, since thesehave a different dependence on R.One might get confused by the fact that the surface r  1  is really nine dimensional as opposed to four dimensional. From the form of the full metric on AdS5  S5we see that as we take   0 the physical size of four of the dimensions of this ninedimensional space grow, while the other five, the S5, remain constant. So, we seethat the theory on this nine dimensional surface becomes effectively four dimensional,since we need to multiply the metric by a factor that goes to zero as we approach theboundary in order to define a finite metric for the four dimensional gauge theory.66Note that even though it is often said that the field theory is defined on the boundaryof AdS, it actually describes all the physics that is going on inside AdS. When we arethinking in the AdS picture it is incorrect to consider at the same time an additionalfield theory living at the boundary1. Different regions of AdS space, which are atdifferent radial positions, correspond to physics at different energy scales in the fieldtheory. It is interesting that depending on what boundary we take, R31 in thePoincare coordinates or S3  R in the global coordinates, we can either have ahorizon or not have one. The presence of a horizon in the R31 case is related to thefact that the theory has no mass gap and we can have excitations at arbitrarily lowenergies. This will always happen when we have a horizon, since by bringing a particleclose to a horizon its energy becomes arbitrarily small. We are talking about the energymeasured with respect to the time associated to the Killing vector that vanishes at thehorizon. In the S3 case there is no horizon, and correspondingly the theory has a gap.In this case the field theory has a discrete spectrum since it is in finite volume.LR R maxLFigure 3.2 Derivation of the IRUV relation by considering a spatial geodesic endingat two points on the boundary.Now let us consider the UVIR correspondence in spaces that are not AdS, like theones which correspond to the field theories living on Dpbranes with p 6 3 see section6.1.3. A simple derivation involves considering a classical spatial geodesic that endson the boundary at two points separated by a distance L in field theory units seefigure 3.2. This geodesic goes into the bulk, and it has a point at which the distanceto the boundary is maximal. Let us call this point rmaxL. Then, one formulation ofthe UVIR relation isr  rmaxL  L. 3.21A similar criterion arises if we consider the wave equation instead of classical geodesics1Except possibly for a small number of singleton fields.67176 of course both are the same since a classical geodesic arises as a limit of the waveequation for very massive particles.Since the radial direction arises holographically, it is not obvious at first sight thatthe theory will be causal in the bulk. Issues of causality in the holographic descriptionof the spacetime physics were discussed in 177, 178, 179, 180.This holographic description has implications for the physics of black holes. Thisdescription should therefore explain how the singularity inside black holes should betreated see 181. Holography also implies that black hole evolution is unitary sincethe boundary theory is unitary. It is not totally clear, from the gravity point of view,how the information comes back out or where it is stored see 182 for a discussion.Some speculations about holography and a new uncertainty principle were discussedin 183.3.2 Tests of the AdSCFT CorrespondenceIn this section we review the direct tests of the AdSCFT correspondence. In section3.1 we saw how string theory on AdS defines a partition function which can be usedto define a field theory. Here we will review the evidence showing that this field theoryis indeed the same as the conjectured dual field theory. We will focus here only ontests of the correspondence between the N  4 SUN SYM theory and the typeIIB string theory compactified on AdS5  S5 most of the tests described here can begeneralized also to cases in other dimensions andor with less supersymmetry, whichwill be described below.As described in section 3.1, the AdSCFT correspondence is a strongweak couplingduality. In the t Hooft large N limit, it relates the region of weak field theory coupling  g2YMN in the SYM theory to the region of high curvature in string units in thestring theory, and vice versa. Thus, a direct comparison of correlation functions isgenerally not possible, since with our current knowledge we can only compute mostof them perturbatively in  on the field theory side and perturbatively in 1 on thestring theory side. For example, as described below, we can compute the equation ofstate of the SYM theory and also the quarkantiquark potential both for small  andfor large , and we obtain different answers, which we do not know how to comparesince we can only compute them perturbatively on both sides. A similar situationarises also in many field theory dualities that were analyzed in the last few years suchas the electricmagnetic SL2,Z duality of the N  4 SYM theory itself, and it wasrealized that there are several properties of these theories which do not depend on thecoupling, so they can be compared to test the duality. These are The global symmetries of the theory, which cannot change as we change the68coupling except for extreme values of the coupling. As discussed in section3.1, in the case of the AdSCFT correspondence we have the same supergroupSU2, 24 whose bosonic subgroup is SO4, 2SU4 as the global symmetryof both theories. Also, both theories are believed to have a nonperturbativeSL2,Z duality symmetry acting on their coupling constant  . These are theonly symmetries of the theory on R4. Additional ZN symmetries arise when thetheories are compactified on nonsimplyconnected manifolds, and these were alsosuccessfully matched in 184, 1522. Some correlation functions, which are usually related to anomalies, are protectedfrom any quantum corrections and do not depend on . The matching of thesecorrelation functions will be described in section 3.2.2 below. The spectrum of chiral operators does not change as the coupling varies, and itwill be compared in section 3.2.1 below. The moduli space of the theory also does not depend on the coupling. In theSUN field theory the moduli space is R6N1SN , parametrized by the eigenvalues of six commuting traceless N  N matrices. On the AdS side it is notclear exactly how to define the moduli space. As described in section 3.1.1, thereis a background of string theory corresponding to any point in the field theorymoduli space, but it is not clear how to see that this is the exact moduli spaceon the string theory side especially since high curvatures arise for generic pointsin the moduli space. The qualitative behavior of the theory upon deformations by relevant or marginaloperators also does not depend on the coupling at least for chiral operatorswhose dimension does not depend on the coupling, and in the absence of phasetransitions. This will be discussed in section 4.3.There are many more qualitative tests of the correspondence, such as the existence of confinement for the finite temperature theory 185, which we will notdiscuss in this section. We will also not discuss here tests involving the behaviorof the theory on its moduli space 169, 186, 170.2Unlike most of the other tests described here, this test actually tests the finite N duality and notjust the large N limit.693.2.1 The Spectrum of Chiral Primary OperatorsThe Field Theory SpectrumThe N  4 supersymmetry algebra in d  4 has four generators QA and their complexconjugates QA, where  is a Weylspinor index in the 2 of the SO3, 1 Lorentzgroup and A is an index in the 4 of the SU4R Rsymmetry group lower indices Awill be taken to transform in the 4 representation. They obey the algebraQA , QB  2PAB,QA , QB   QA, QB  0,3.22where i i  1, 2, 3 are the Pauli matrices and 0   we use the conventionsof Wess and Bagger 187.N  4 supersymmetry in four dimensions has a unique multiplet which does notinclude spins greater than one, which is the vector multiplet. It includes a vector fieldA  is a vector index of the SO3, 1 Lorentz group, four complex Weyl fermions Ain the 4 of SU4R, and six real scalars I where I is an index in the 6 of SU4R.The classical action of the supersymmetry generators on these fields is schematicallygiven for onshell fields byQA , I   B,QA , B  F   I , J ,QA , B   DI ,QA , A  A ,3.23with similar expressions for the action of the Qs, where  are the generators ofthe Lorentz group in the spinor representation, D is the covariant derivative, thefield strength F  D,D, and we have suppressed the SU4 ClebschGordancoefficients corresponding to the products 4 6  4, 4 4  1 15 and 4 4  6in the first three lines of 3.23.An N  4 supersymmetric field theory is uniquely determined by specifying thegauge group, and its field content is a vector multiplet in the adjoint of the gaugegroup. Such a field theory is equivalent to an N  2 theory with one hypermultipletin the adjoint representation, or to an N  1 theory with three chiral multiplets i inthe adjoint representation in the 323 of the SU3  U1R  SU4R which is leftunbroken by the choice of a single N  1 SUSY generator and a superpotential of theform W  ijkTrijk. The interactions of the theory include a scalar potentialproportional toI,J TrI , J 2, such that the moduli space of the theory is the spaceof commuting matrices I I  1,    , 6.70The spectrum of operators in this theory includes all the gauge invariant quantitiesthat can be formed from the fields described above. In this section we will focuson local operators which involve fields taken at the same point in spacetime. Forthe SUN theory described above, properties of the adjoint representation of SUNdetermine that such operators necessarily involve a product of traces of products offields or the sum of such products. It is natural to divide the operators into singletrace operators and multipletrace operators. In the t Hooft large N limit correlationfunctions involving multipletrace operators are suppressed by powers of N comparedto those of singletrace operators involving the same fields. We will discuss here indetail only the singletrace operators the multipletrace operators appear in operatorproduct expansions of products of singletrace operators.As discussed in section 2.1, it is natural to classify the operators in a conformaltheory into primary operators and their descendants. In a superconformal theory itis also natural to distinguish between chiral primary operators, which are in shortrepresentations of the superconformal algebra and are annihilated by some of the supercharges, and nonchiral primary operators. Representations of the superconformalalgebra are formed by starting with some state of lowest dimension, which is annihilated by the operators S and K, and acting on it with the operators Q and P.The N  4 supersymmetry algebra involves 16 real supercharges. A generic primaryrepresentation of the superconformal algebra will thus include 216 primaries of theconformal algebra, generated by acting on the lowest state with products of differentsupercharges acting with additional supercharges always leads to descendants of theconformal algebra i.e. derivatives. Since the supercharges have helicities 12, theprimary fields in such representations will have a range of helicities between   4 ifthe lowest dimension operator  has helicity  and   4 acting with more than 8supercharges of the same helicity either annihilates the state or leads to a conformaldescendant. In nongeneric representations of the superconformal algebra a productof less than 16 different Qs annihilates the lowest dimension operator, and the rangeof helicities appearing is smaller. In particular, in the small representations of theN  4 superconformal algebra only up to 4 Qs of the same helicity acting on thelowest dimension operator give a nonzero result, and the range of helicities is between 2 and  2. For the N  4 supersymmetry algebra not including the conformalalgebra it is known that medium representations, whose range of helicities is 6, canalso exist they arise, for instance, on the moduli space of the SUN N  4 SYMtheory 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195 it is not clear if such medium representations of the superconformal algebra 196 can appear in physical theories or notthere are no known examples. More details on the structure of representations of theN  4 superconformal algebra may be found in 85, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 196 andreferences therein.71In the U1 N  4 SYM theory which is a free theory, the only gaugeinvariantsingle trace operators are the fields of the vector multiplet itself which are I , A, Aand F  A. These operators form an ultrashort representation of the N  4algebra whose range of helicities is from 1 to 1 acting with more than two supercharges of the same helicity on any of these states gives either zero or derivatives,which are descendants of the conformal algebra. All other local gauge invariant operators in the theory involve derivatives or products of these operators. This representation is usually called the doubleton representation, and it does not appearin the SUN SYM theory though the representations which do appear can all beformed by tensor products of the doubleton representation. In the context of AdSspace one can think of this multiplet as living purely on the boundary of the space202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 87, 86, 207, 208, 209, 210, as expected for the U1 part ofthe original UN gauge group of the D3branes see the discussion in section 3.1.There is no known simple systematic way to compute the full spectrum of chiralprimary operators of theN  4 SUN SYM theory, so we will settle for presenting theknown chiral primary operators. The lowest component of a superconformalprimarymultiplet is characterized by the fact that it cannot be written as a supercharge Qacting on any other operator. Looking at the action of the supersymmetry charges3.23 suggests that generally operators built from the fermions and the gauge fieldswill be descendants given by Q acting on some other fields, so one would expectthe lowest components of the chiral primary representations to be built only from thescalar fields, and this turns out to be correct.Let us analyze the behavior of operators of the form OI1I2In  TrI1I2   In.First we can ask if this operator can be written as Q, for any field . In theSUSY algebra 3.23 only commutators of I s appear on the right hand side, so we seethat if some of the indices are antisymmetric the field will be a descendant. Thus, onlysymmetric combinations of the indices will be lowest components of primary multiplets.Next, we should ask if the multiplet built on such an operator is a short chiralprimary multiplet or not. There are several different ways to answer this question.One possibility is to use the relation between the dimension of chiral primary operatorsand their Rsymmetry representation 94, 95, 96, 93, 97, and to check if this relationis obeyed in the free field theory, where OI1I2In  n. In this way we find that therepresentation is chiral primary if and only if the indices form a symmetric tracelessproduct of n 6s traceless representations are defined as those who give zero whenany two indices are contracted. This is a representation of weight 0, n, 0 of SU4Rin this section we will refer to SU4R representations either by their dimensions inboldface or by their weights.Another way to check this is to see if by acting with Qs on these operators we get themost general possible states or not, namely if the representation contains null vectors72or not it turns out that in all the relevant cases null vectors appear already at thefirst level by acting with a single Q, though in principle there could be representationswhere null vectors appear only at higher levels. Using the SUSY algebra 3.23it is easy to see that for symmetric traceless representations we get null vectorswhile for other representations we do not. For instance, let us analyze in detail thecase n  2. The symmetric product of two 6s is given by 6 6  1 20. Thefield in the 1 representation is TrII, for which QA ,TrII  CAJBTrBJwhere CAIB is a ClebschGordan coefficient for 4 6  4. The righthand side isin the 4 representation, which is the most general representation that can appear inthe product 4 1, so we find no null vectors at this level. On the other hand, if welook at the symmetric traceless product TrIJ  TrIJ 16IJTrKK in the20 representation, we find that QA ,TrIJ  TrBK with the righthandside being in the 20 representation appearing in 4 6  4 20, while the lefthandside could in principle be in the 4 20  20 60. Since the 60 does not appear onthe righthand side it is a null vector we identify that the representation built onthe 20 is a short representation of the SUSY algebra. By similar manipulations see20, 211, 197, 200 for more details one can verify that chiral primary representationscorrespond exactly to symmetric traceless products of 6s.It is possible to analyze the chiral primary spectrum also by using N  1 subalgebrasof theN  4 algebra. If we use anN  1 subalgebra of theN  4 algebra, as describedabove, the operators On include the chiral operators of the form Tri1i2   in ina representation of SU3 which is a symmetric product of 3s, but for a particularchoice of the N  1 subalgebra not all the operators On appear to be chiral a shortmultiplet of the N  4 algebra includes both short and long multiplets of the N  1subalgebra.The last issue we should discuss is what is the range of values of n. The productof more than N commuting3 N  N matrices can always be written as a sum ofproducts of traces of less than N of the matrices, so it does not form an independentoperator. This means that for n  N we can express the operator OI1I2In in termsof other operators, up to operators including commutators which as explained aboveare descendants of the SUSY algebra. Thus, we find that the short chiral primaryrepresentations are built on the operators On  OI1I2In with n  2, 3,    , N , forwhich the indices are in the symmetric traceless product of n 6s in a UN theorywe would find the same spectrum with the additional representation corresponding ton  1. The superconformal algebra determines the dimension of these fields to beOn  n, which is the same as their value in the free field theory. We argued above3We can limit the discussion to commuting matrices since, as discussed above, commutators alwayslead to descendants, and we can write any product of matrices as a product of commuting matricesplus terms with commutators.73that these are the only short chiral primary representations in the SUN gauge theory,but we will not attempt to rigorously prove this here.The full chiral primary representations are obtained by acting on the fields On bythe generators Q and P of the supersymmetry algebra. The representation built onOn contains a total of 256 112n2n2 1 primary states, of which half are bosonic andhalf are fermionic. Since these multiplets are built on a field of helicity zero, they willcontain primary fields of helicities between 2 and 2. The highest dimension primaryfield in the multiplet is generically of the form Q4Q4On, and its dimension is n  4.There is an elegant way to write these multiplets as traces of products of twistedchiral N  4 superfields 211, 197 see also 212 which checks some components ofthese superfields against the couplings to supergravity modes predicted on the basis ofthe DBI action for D3branes in antide Sitter space 213.It is easy to find the form of all the fields in such a multiplet by using the algebra3.23. For example, let us analyze here in detail the bosonic primary fields of dimensionn1 in the multiplet. To get a field of dimension n1 we need to act on On with twosupercharges recall that Q  12. If we act with two supercharges QA of the samechirality, their Lorentz indices can be either antisymmetrized or symmetrized. In thefirst case we get a Lorentz scalar field in the 2, n  2, 0 representation of SU4R,which is of the schematic formQ, Q ,On  TrABJ1   Jn2  TrK1, K2L1   Ln1. 3.24Using an N  1 subalgebra some of these operators may be written as the lowestcomponents of the chiral superfields TrW 2j1   jn2. In the second case we getan antisymmetric 2form of the Lorentz group, in the 0, n  1, 0 representation ofSU4R, of the formQ, Q,On  TrFJ1   Jn1  TrABK1   Kn2. 3.25Both of these fields are complex, with the complex conjugate fields given by the actionof two Qs. Acting with one Q and one Q on the state On gives a real Lorentzvectorfield in the 1, n 2, 1 representation of SU4R, of the formQ, Q,On  TrABJ1   Jn2  TrDJK1   Kn1. 3.26At dimension n 2 acting with four supercharges we find  A complex scalar field in the 0, n 2, 0 representation, given by Q4On, of theform TrF 2I1   In2    . A real scalar field in the 2, n  4, 2 representation, given by Q2Q2On, of theform TrA1A2B1 B2I1   In4    .74 A complex vector field in the 1, n4, 1 representation, given by Q3QOn, of theform TrFDJI1   In2    . An complex antisymmetric 2form field in the 2, n 3, 0 representation, givenby Q2Q2On, of the form TrF J1, J2I1   In2    . A symmetric tensor field in the 0, n 2, 0 representation, given by Q2Q2On, ofthe form TrDJDKI1   In2    .The spectrum of primary fields at dimension n3 is similar to that of dimension n1the same fields appear but in smaller SU4R representations, and at dimension n4there is a single primary field, which is a real scalar in the 0, n 4, 0 representation,given by Q4Q4On, of the form TrF 4I1   In4    . Note that fields with morethan four F s or more than eight s are always descendants or nonchiral primaries.For n  2, 3 the short multiplets are even shorter since some of the representationsappearing above vanish. In particular, for n  2 the highestdimension primaries in thechiral primary multiplet have dimension n 2  4. The n  2 representation includesthe currents of the superconformal algebra. It includes a vector of dimension 3 in the15 representation which is the SU4R Rsymmetry current, and a symmetric tensorfield of dimension 4 which is the energymomentum tensor the other currents of thesuperconformal algebra are descendants of these. The n  2 multiplet also includesa complex scalar field which is an SU4Rsinglet, whose real part is the Lagrangiandensity coupling to 14g2Y Mof the form TrF 2     and whose imaginary part is theLagrangian density coupling to  of the form TrF  F . For later use we note thatthe chiral primary multiplets which contain scalars of dimension   4 are the n  2multiplet which has a scalar in the 20 of dimension 2, a complex scalar in the 10 ofdimension 3, and a complex scalar in the 1 of dimension 4, the n  3 multiplet whichcontains a scalar in the 50 of dimension 3 and a complex scalar in the 45 of dimension4, and the n  4 multiplet which contains a scalar in the 105 of dimension 4.The String Theory Spectrum and the MatchingAs discussed in section 3.1.2, fields on AdS5 are in a onetoone correspondence withoperators in the dual conformal field theory. Thus, the spectrum of operators describedin section 3.2.1 should agree with the spectrum of fields of type IIB string theory onAdS5  S5. Fields on AdS naturally lie in the same multiplets of the conformal groupas primary operators the second Casimir of these representations is C2  4 fora primary scalar field of dimension  in the field theory, and C2  m2R2 for a field ofmass m on an AdS5 space with a radius of curvature R. Singletrace operators in thefield theory may be identified with singleparticle states in AdS5, while multipletraceoperators correspond to multiparticle states.75Unfortunately, it is not known how to compute the full spectrum of type IIB stringtheory on AdS5S5. In fact, the only known states are the states which arise from thedimensional reduction of the tendimensional type IIB supergravity multiplet. Thesefields all have helicities between 2 and 2, so it is clear that they all lie in small multiplets of the superconformal algebra, and we will describe below how they match withthe small multiplets of the field theory described above. String theory on AdS5S5 isexpected to have many additional states, with masses of the order of the string scale 1lsor of the Planck scale 1lp. Such states would correspond using the massdimensionrelation described above to operators in the field theory with dimensions of order  gsN14 or   N14 for large N, gsN . Presumably none of these states are insmall multiplets of the superconformal algebra at least, this would be the predictionof the AdSCFT correspondence.The spectrum of type IIB supergravity compactified on AdS5S5 was computed in126. The computation involves expanding the ten dimensional fields in appropriatespherical harmonics on S5, plugging them into the supergravity equations of motion,linearized around the AdS5  S5 background, and diagonalizing the equations to giveequations of motion for free massless or massive fields4. For example, the ten dimensional dilaton field  may be expanded as x, y k0 kxY ky where x is a coordinate on AdS5, y is a coordinate on S5, and the Y k are the scalar spherical harmonicson S5. These spherical harmonics are in representations corresponding to symmetrictraceless products of 6s of SU4R they may be written as Yky  yI1yI2    yIkwhere the yI , for I  1, 2,    , 6 and with 6I1yI2  1, are coordinates on S5. Thus,we find a field kx on AdS5 in each such 0, k, 0 representation of SU4R, and theequations of motion determine the mass of this field to be m2k  kk4R2. A similarexpansion may be performed for all other fields.If we organize the results of 126 into representations of the superconformal algebra85, we find representations of the form described in the previous section, which arebuilt on a lowest dimension field which is a scalar in the 0, n, 0 representation ofSU4R for n  2, 3,    ,. The lowest dimension scalar field in each representationturns out to arise from a linear combination of spherical harmonic modes of the S5components of the graviton haa expanded around the AdS5  S5 vacuum and the4form field Dabcd, where a, b, c, d are indices on S5. The scalar fields of dimensionn  1 correspond to 2form fields Bab with indices in the S5. The symmetric tensorfields arise from the expansion of the AdS5components of the graviton. The dilatonfields described above are the complex scalar fields arising with dimension n2 in themultiplet as described in the previous subsection.In particular, the n  2 representation is called the supergraviton representation, and4The fields arising from different spherical harmonics are related by a spectrum generating algebra, see 214.76it includes the field content of d  5,N  8 gauged supergravity. The fieldoperatorcorrespondence matches this representation to the representation including the superconformal currents in the field theory. It includes a massless graviton field, which asexpected corresponds to the energymomentum tensor in the field theory, and masslessSU4R gauge fields which correspond to or couple to the global SU4R currents inthe field theory.In the naive dimensional reduction of the type IIB supergravity fields, the n  1doubleton representation, corresponding to a free U1 vector multiplet in the dualtheory, also appears. However, the modes of this multiplet are all pure gauge modes inthe bulk of AdS5, and they may be set to zero there. This is one of the reasons why itseems more natural to view the corresponding gauge theory as an SUN gauge theoryand not a UN theory. It may be possible and perhaps even natural to add thedoubleton representation to the theory even though it does not include modes whichpropagate in the bulk of AdS5, but instead it is equivalent to a topological theory inthe bulk to obtain a theory which is dual to the UN gauge theory, but this will notaffect most of our discussion in this review so we will ignore this possibility here.Comparing the results described above with the results of section 3.2.1, we see thatwe find the same spectrum of chiral primary operators for n  2, 3,    , N . The supergravity results cannot be trusted for masses above the order of the string scale whichcorresponds to n  gsN14 or the Planck scale which corresponds to n  N14, sothe results agree within their range of validity. The field theory results suggest that theexact spectrum of chiral representations in type IIB string theory on AdS5S5 actuallymatches the naive supergravity spectrum up to a mass scale m2  N2R2  N32M2pwhich is much higher than the string scale and the Planck scale, and that there are nochiral fields above this scale. It is not known how to check this prediction treelevelstring theory is certainly not enough for this since when gs  0 we must take N   toobtain a finite value of gsN . Thus, with our current knowledge the matching of chiralprimaries of the N  4 SYM theory with those of string theory on AdS5  S5 teststhe duality only in the large N limit. In some generalizations of the AdSCFT correspondence the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary even for finite N , and thenclassical string theory should lead to exactly the same spectrum of chiral operators asthe field theory. This happens in particular for the nearhorizon limit of NS5branes, inwhich case the exact spectrum was successfully compared in 215. In other instancesof the AdSCFT correspondence such as the ones discussed in 216, 217, 218 thereexist also additional chiral primary multiplets with n of order N , and these have beensuccessfully matched with wrapped branes on the string theory side.The fact that there seem to be no nonchiral fields on AdS5 with a mass below thestring scale suggests that for large N and large gsN , the dimension of all nonchiraloperators in the field theory, such as TrII, grows at least as gsN14  g2YMN14.77The reason for this behavior on the field theory side is not clear it is a prediction ofthe AdSCFT correspondence.3.2.2 Matching of Correlation Functions and AnomaliesThe classical N  4 theory has a scale invariance symmetry and an SU4R Rsymmetry, and unlike many other theories these symmetries are exact also in thefull quantum theory. However, when the theory is coupled to external gravitational orSU4R gauge fields, these symmetries are broken by quantum effects. In field theorythis breaking comes from oneloop diagrams and does not receive any further corrections thus it can be computed also in the strong coupling regime and compared withthe results from string theory on AdS space.We will begin by discussing the anomaly associated with the SU4R global currents.These currents are chiral since the fermions A are in the 4 representation while thefermions of the opposite chirality A are in the 4 representation. Thus, if we gauge theSU4R global symmetry, we will find an AdlerBellJackiw anomaly from the trianglediagram of three SU4R currents, which is proportional to the number of chargedfermions. In the SUN gauge theory this number is N2  1. The anomaly can beexpressed either in terms of the 3point function of the SU4R global currents,JaxJbyJcz N2  1326idabcTr 5 6 x 6 y 6 y 6 z 6 z 6 xx y4y  z4z  x4 , 3.27where dabc  2TrT aT b, T c and we take only the negative parity component of thecorrelator, or in terms of the nonconservation of the SU4R current when the theoryis coupled to external SU4R gauge fields Fa ,DJa N2  13842idabcF bFc. 3.28How can we see this effect in string theory on AdS5  S5  One way to see itis, of course, to use the general prescription of section 3.3 to compute the 3pointfunction 3.27, and indeed one finds 219, 220 the correct answer to leading orderin the large N limit namely, one recovers the term proportional to N2. It is moreilluminating, however, to consider directly the meaning of the anomaly 3.28 from thepoint of view of the AdS theory 20. In the AdS theory we have gauge fields Aa whichcouple, as explained above, to the SU4R global currents Ja of the gauge theory, butthe anomaly means that when we turn on nonzero field strengths for these fields thetheory should no longer be gauge invariant. This effect is precisely reproduced by aChernSimons term which exists in the lowenergy supergravity theory arising from the78compactification of type IIB supergravity on AdS5  S5, which is of the formiN2962AdS5d5xdabcAaAbAc    . 3.29This term is gauge invariant up to total derivatives, which means that if we take agauge transformation Aa  AaDa for which  does not vanish on the boundaryof AdS5, the action will change by a boundary term of the form iN23842AdS5d4xdabcaF bFc. 3.30From this we can read off the anomaly in DJ since, when we have a coupling ofthe formd4xAaJa , the change in the action under a gauge transformation is given byd4xDaJa  d4xaDJa, and we find exact agreement with 3.28 for largeN .The other anomaly in the N  4 SYM theory is the conformal or Weyl anomalysee 221, 222 and references therein, indicating the breakdown of conformal invariancewhen the theory is coupled to a curved external metric there is a similar breakdown ofconformal invariance when the theory is coupled to external SU4R gauge fields, whichwe will not discuss here. The conformal anomaly is related to the 2point and 3pointfunctions of the energymomentum tensor 223, 224, 74, 225. In four dimensions, thegeneral form of the conformal anomaly isgT  aE4  cI4, 3.31whereE4 1162R2  4R2 R2,I4  1162R2  2R2 13R2,3.32where R is the curvature tensor, R  R is the Riemann tensor, andR  R isthe scalar curvature. A free field computation in the SUN N  4 SYM theory leadsto a  c  N2  14. In supersymmetric theories the supersymmetry algebra relatesgT to derivatives of the Rsymmetry current, so it is protected from any quantumcorrections. Thus, the same result should be obtained in type IIB string theory onAdS5  S5, and to leading order in the large N limit it should be obtained from typeIIB supergravity on AdS5S5. This was indeed found to be true in 226, 227, 228, 2295,where the conformal anomaly was shown to arise from subtleties in the regularizationof the divergent supergravity action on AdS space. The result of 226, 227, 228, 229implies that a computation using gravity on AdS5 always gives rise to theories with5A generalization with more varying fields may be found in 230.79a  c, so generalizations of the AdSCFT correspondence which have for large N asupergravity approximation are limited to conformal theories which have a  c in thelarge N limit. Of course, if we do not require the string theory to have a supergravityapproximation then there is no such restriction.For both of the anomalies we described the field theory and string theory computations agree for the leading terms, which are of order N2. Thus, they are successful testsof the duality in the large N limit. For other instances of the AdSCFT correspondencethere are corrections to anomalies at order 1N  gsR22 such corrections werediscussed in 231 and successfully compared in 232, 233, 2346. It would be interestingto compare other corrections to the large N result.Computations of other correlation functions 235, 236, 237, such as 3point functions of chiral primary operators and correlation functions which have only instantoncontributions we will discuss these in section 4.2, have suggested that they are alsothe same at small  and at large , even though they are not related to anomalies inany known way. Perhaps there is some nonrenormalization theorem also for these correlation functions, in which case their agreement would also be a test of the AdSCFTcorrespondence. As discussed in 238, 239 see also 146 the nonrenormalizationtheorem for 3point functions of chiral primary operators would follow from a conjectured U1Y symmetry of the 3point functions of N  4 SCFTs involving at least twooperators which are descendants of chiral primaries7. This symmetry is a property oftype IIB supergravity on AdS5  S5 but not of the full type IIB string theory.3.3 Correlation FunctionsA useful statement of the AdSCFT correspondence is that the partition function ofstring theory on AdS5S5 should coincide with the partition function of N  4 superYangMills theory on the boundary of AdS5 19, 20. The basic idea was explainedin section 3.1.2, but before summarizing the actual calculations of Greens functions, itseems worthwhile to motivate the methodology from a somewhat different perspective.Throughout this section, we approximate the string theory partition function byeISUGRA, where ISUGRA is the supergravity action evaluated on AdS5S5 or on smalldeformations of this space. This approximation amounts to ignoring all the stringy corrections that cure the divergences of supergravity, and also all the loop corrections,which are controlled essentially by the gravitational coupling   gst2. On the gauge6Computing such corrections tests the conjecture that the correspondence holds order by order in1N  however, this is weaker than the statement that the correspondence holds for finite N , since the1N expansion is not expected to converge.7A proof of this, using the analytic harmonic superspace formalism which is conjectured to be validin the N  4 theory, was recently given in 240.80theory side, as explained in section 3.1.2, this approximation amounts to taking bothN and g2YMN large, and the basic relation becomeseISUGRA  Zstring  Zgauge  eW , 3.33where W is the generating functional for connected Greens functions in the gaugetheory. At finite temperature,W  F where  is the inverse temperature and F is thefree energy of the gauge theory. When we apply this relation to a Schwarzschild blackhole in AdS5, which is thought to be reflected in the gauge theory by a thermal stateat the Hawking temperature of the black hole, we arrive at the relation ISUGRA  F .Calculating the free energy of a black hole from the Euclidean supergravity action hasa long tradition in the supergravity literature 241, so the main claim that is beingmade here is that the dual gauge theory provides a description of the state of the blackhole which is physically equivalent to the one in string theory. We will discuss thefinite temperature case further in section 3.6, and devote the rest of this section to thepartition function of the field theory on R4.The main technical idea behind the bulkboundary correspondence is that the boundary values of string theory fields in particular, supergravity fields act as sources forgaugeinvariant operators in the field theory. From a Dbrane perspective, we think ofclosed string states in the bulk as sourcing gauge singlet operators on the brane whichoriginate as composite operators built from open strings. We will write the bulk fieldsgenerically as x, z in the coordinate system 3.17, with value 0x for z  .The true boundary of antide Sitter space is z  0, and  6 0 serves as a cutoff whichwill eventually be removed. In the supergravity approximation, we think of choosingthe values 0 arbitrarily and then extremizing the action ISUGRA in the region z  subject to these boundary conditions. In short, we solve the equations of motion inthe bulk subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on the boundary, and evaluate theaction on the solution. If there is more than one solution, then we have more thanone saddle point contributing to the string theory partition function, and we mustdetermine which is most important. In this section, multiple saddle points will not bea problem. So, we can writeWgauge0   loged4x 0xOxCFT extremumz0ISUGRA . 3.34That is, the generator of connected Greens functions in the gauge theory, in the largeN, g2YMN limit, is the onshell supergravity action.Note that in 3.34 we have not attempted to be prescient about inserting factorsof . Instead our strategy will be to use 3.34 without modification to compute twopoint functions of O, and then perform a wavefunction renormalization on either Oor  so that the final answer is independent of the cutoff. This approach should be81workable even in a space with boundary which is not asymptotically antide Sitter,corresponding to a field theory which does not have a conformal fixed point in theultraviolet.A remark is in order regarding the relation of 3.34 to the old approach of extractingGreens functions from an absorption crosssection 12. In absorption calculations oneis keeping the whole D3brane geometry, not just the nearhorizon AdS5  S5 throat.The usual treatment is to split the space into a near region the throat and a farregion. The incoming wave from asymptotically flat infinity can be regarded as fixingthe value of a supergravity field at the outer boundary of the near region. As usual,the supergravity description is valid at large N and large t Hooft coupling. At smallt Hooft coupling, there is a different description of the process a cluster of D3branessits at some location in flat tendimensional space, and the incoming wave impingesupon it. In the lowenergy limit, the value of the supergravity field which the D3branesfeel is the same as the value in the curved space description at the boundary of thenear horizon region. Equation 3.34 is just a mathematical expression of the fact thatthe throat geometry should respond identically to the perturbed supergravity fields asthe lowenergy theory on the D3branes.Following 19, 20, a number of papersnotably 242, 243, 219, 244, 220, 245, 246,235, 247, 236, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254have undertaken the program of extracting explicit npoint correlation functions of gauge singlet operators by developingboth sides of 3.34 in a power series in 0. Because the right hand side is the extremization of a classical action, the power series has a graphical representation in termsof treelevel Feynman graphs for fields in the supergravity. There is one difference inordinary Feynman graphs one assigns the wavefunctions of asymptotic states to theexternal legs of the graph, but in the present case the external leg factors reflect theboundary values 0. They are special limits of the usual gravity propagators in thebulk, and are called bulktoboundary propagators. We will encounter their explicitform in the next two sections.3.3.1 Twopoint FunctionsFor twopoint functions, only the part of the action which is quadratic in the relevantfield perturbation is needed. For massive scalar fields in AdS5, this has the genericformS  d5xg122  12m22, 3.35where  is some normalization which in principle follows from the tendimensionalorigin of the action. The bulktoboundary propagator is a particular solution of theequation of motion,  m2  0, which has special asymptotic properties. We willstart by considering the momentum space propagator, which is useful for computing82the twopoint function and also in situations where the bulk geometry loses conformalinvariance then, we will discuss the position space propagator, which has proven moreconvenient for the study of higher point correlators in the conformal case. We willalways work in Euclidean space8. A coordinate system in the bulk of AdS5 such thatds2 R2z2dx2  dz23.36provides manifest Euclidean symmetry on the directions parametrized by x. To avoiddivergences associated with the small z region of integration in 3.35, we will employan explicit cutoff, z  .A complete set of solutions for the linearized equation of motion,  m2  0, isgiven by   eipxZpz, where the function Zu satisfies the radial equationu5u1u3u  u2 m2R2Zu  0 . 3.37There are two independent solutions to 3.37, namely Zu  u2I2u and Zu u2K2u, where I and K are Bessel functions and  2 4 m2R2 . 3.38The second solution is selected by the requirement of regularity in the interior I2uincreases exponentially as u   and does not lead to a finite action configuration9.Imposing the boundary condition x, z  0x  eipx at z  , we find the bulktoboundary propagatorx, z  Kpx, z pz2K2pzp2K2peipx . 3.39To compute a twopoint function of the operator O for which 0 is a source, we writeOpOq 2W0  1eipx  2eiqx12120 leading analytic terms in p2 282 43 14p qp224 higher order terms in p2,OxOy  28 2 4  12 21x y2 .3.40Several explanatory remarks are in order8The results may be analytically continued to give the correlation functions of the field theory onMinkowskian R4, which corresponds to the Poincare coordinates of AdS space.9Note that this solution, when continued to Lorentzian AdS space, generally involves the nonnormalizable mode of the field, with  in 2.34.83 To establish the second equality in 3.40 we have used 3.39, substituted in3.35, performed the integral and expanded in . The leading analytic termsgive rise to contact terms in position space, and the higher order terms are unimportant in the limit where we remove the cutoff. Only the leading nonanalyticterm is essential. We have given the expression for generic real values of .Expanding around integer   2 one obtains finite expressions involving log p. The Fourier transforms used to obtain the last line are singular, but they can bedefined for generic complex  by analytic continuation and for positive integer by expanding around a pole and dropping divergent terms, in the spirit ofdifferential regularization 255. The result is a pure power law dependence onthe separation x y, as required by conformal invariance. We have assumed a coupling  d4xx, z  Ox to compute the Greens functions. The explicit powers of the cutoff in the final position space answer canbe eliminated by absorbing a factor of 4 into the definition of O. From hereon we will take that convention, which amounts to inserting a factor of 4 onthe right hand side of 3.39. In fact, precise matchings between the normalizations in field theory and in string theory for all the chiral primary operatorshave not been worked out. In part this is due to the difficulty of determiningthe coupling of bulk fields to field theory operators or in stringy terms, the coupling of closed string states to composite open string operators on the brane.See 11 for an early approach to this problem. For the dilaton, the graviton,and their superpartners including gauge fields in AdS5, the couplings can beworked out explicitly. In some of these cases all normalizations have been workedout unambiguously and checked against field theory predictions see for example19, 219, 236. The massdimension relation 3.38 holds even for string states that are not included in the KaluzaKlein supergravity reduction the mass and the dimensionare just different expressions of the second Casimir of SO4, 2. For instance,excited string states, with m  1, are expected to correspond to operatorswith dimension   g2YMN14. The remarkable fact is that all the string theory modes with m  1R which is to say, all closed string states which arisefrom massless ten dimensional fields fall in short multiplets of the supergroupSU2, 24. All other states have a much larger mass. The operators in shortmultiplets have algebraically protected dimensions. The obvious conclusion isthat all operators whose dimensions are not algebraically protected have largedimension in the strong t Hooft coupling, large N limit to which supergravityapplies. This is no longer true for theories of reduced supersymmetry the supergroup gets smaller, but the KaluzaKlein states are roughly as numerous as84before, and some of them escape the short multiplets and live in long multipletsof the smaller supergroups. They still have a mass on the order of 1R, andtypically correspond to dimensions which are finite in the large g2YMN limitbut irrational.Correlation functions of nonscalar operators have been widely studied following20 the literature includes 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266. ForN  4 superYangMills theory, all correlation functions of fields in chiral multipletsshould follow by application of supersymmetries once those of the chiral primary fieldsare known, so in this case it should be enough to study the scalars. It is worthwhileto note however that the massdimension formula changes for particles with spin. Infact the definition of mass has some conventiondependence. Conventions seem fairlyuniform in the literature, and a table of massdimension relations in AdSd1 with unitradius was made in 145 from the various sources cited above see also 211 scalars   12dd2  4m2, spinors   12d 2m, vectors   12dd 22  4m2, pforms   12dd 2p2  4m2, firstorder d2forms d even   12d 2m, spin32   12d 2m, massless spin2   d.In the case of fields with second order lagrangians, we have not attempted to pickwhich of  is the physical dimension. Usually the choice    is clear from theunitarity bound, but in some cases notably m2  154 in AdS5 there is a genuineambiguity. In practice this ambiguity is usually resolved by appealing to some specialalgebraic property of the relevant fields, such as transformation under supersymmetryor a global bosonic symmetry. See section 2.2.2 for further discussion. The scalar caseabove is precisely equation 2.36 in that section.For brevity we will omit a further discussion of higher spins, and instead refer thereader to the extensive literature.3.3.2 Threepoint FunctionsWorking with bulktoboundary propagators in the momentum representation is convenient for twopoint functions, but for higher point functions position space is preferred85because the full conformal invariance is more obvious. However, for nonconformal examples of the bulkboundary correspondence, the momentum representation seems uniformly more convenient. The boundary behavior of position space bulktoboundarypropagators is specified in a slightly more subtle way following 219 we requireKx, z y  z44x y as z  0 . 3.41Here y is the point on the boundary where we insert the operator, and x, z is a pointin the bulk. The unique regular K solving the equation of motion and satisfying3.41 isKx, z y 2 2zz2  x y2. 3.42At a fixed cutoff, z  , the bulktoboundary propagator Kx,  y is a continuousfunction which approximates 44x  y better and better as   0. Thus atany finite , the Fourier transform of 3.42 only approximately coincides with 3.39modified by the factor of 4 as explained after 3.40. This apparently innocuoussubtlety turned out to be important for twopoint functions, as discovered in 219.A correct prescription is to specify boundary conditions at finite z  , cut off allbulk integrals at that boundary, and only afterwards take   0. That is what wehave done in 3.40. Calculating twopoint functions directly using the positionspacepropagators 3.41, but cutting the bulk integrals off again at , and finally taking thesame   0 answer, one arrives at a different answer. This is not surprising since thez   boundary conditions were not used consistently. The authors of 219 checkedthat using the cutoff consistently i.e. with the momentum space propagators gavetwopoint functions Ox1Ox2 a normalization such that Ward identities involvingthe threepoint function Ox1Ox2Jx3, where J is a conserved current, wereobeyed. Twopoint functions are uniquely difficult because of the poor convergenceproperties of the integrals over z. The integrals involved in threepoint functions aresufficiently benign that one can ignore the issue of how to impose the cutoff.If one has a Euclidean bulk action for three scalar fields 1, 2, and 3, of the formS d5xgi12i2  12m2i2i  123, 3.43and if the i couple to operators in the field theory by interaction termsd4xiOi,then the calculation of O1O2O3 reduces, via 3.34, to the evaluation of the graphshown in figure 3.3. That is,O1x1O2x2O3x3  d5xgK1x x1K2x x2K3x x3a1x1  x2123x1  x3132x2  x3231,3.44861 23Figure 3.3 The Feynman graph for the threepoint function as computed in supergravity. The legs correspond to factors of Ki, and the cubic vertex to a factor of .The position of the vertex is integrated over AdS5.for some constant a1. The dependence on the xi is dictated by the conformal invariance,but the only way to compute a1 is by performing the integral over x. The result 219isa1  121 2 3121 3 2122 3 1241  22  23  2121 2 3 2.3.45In principle one could also have couplings of the form 123. This leads only to amodification of the constant a1.The main technical difficulty with threepoint functions is that one must figure outthe cubic couplings of supergravity fields. Because of the difficulties in writing downa covariant action for type IIB supergravity in ten dimensions see however 267, 268,269, it is most straightforward to read off these cubic couplings from quadraticterms in the equations of motion. In flat tendimensional space these terms can be readoff directly from the original type IIB supergravity papers 125, 270. For AdS5  S5,one must instead expand in fluctuations around the background metric and fiveformfield strength. The old literature 126 only dealt with the linearized equations ofmotion for 3point functions it is necessary to go to one higher order of perturbationtheory. This was done for a restricted set of fields in 235. The fields consideredwere those dual to operators of the form TrJ1J2 . . . J in field theory, where theparentheses indicate a symmetrized traceless product. These operators are the chiralprimaries of the gauge theory all other single trace operators of protected dimensiondescend from these by commuting with supersymmetry generators. Only the metricand the fiveform are involved in the dual supergravity fields, and we are interestedonly in modes which are scalars in AdS5. The result of 235 is that the equations of87motion for the scalar modes sI dual toOI  CIJ1...JTrJ1 . . . J 3.46follow from an action of the formS 4N225d5xgIAIwI22sI2  ll  4s2II1,I2,I3GI1I2I3wI1wI2wI33sI1 sI2 sI3.3.47Derivative couplings of the form sss are expected a priori to enter into 3.47,but an appropriate field redefinition eliminates them. The notation in 3.46 and3.47 requires some explanation. I is an index which runs over the weight vectorsof all possible representations constructed as symmetric traceless products of the 6 ofSU4R. These are the representations whose Young diagrams are , , ,   . CIJ1...Jis a basis transformation matrix, chosen so that CIJ1...JCJJ1...J  IJ . As commented inthe previous section, there is generally a normalization ambiguity on how supergravityfields couple to operators in the gauge theory. We have taken the coupling to bed4x sIOI , and the normalization ambiguity is represented by the leg factors wI .It is the combination sI  wI sI rather than sI itself which has a definite relationto supergravity fields. We refer the reader to 235 for explicit expressions for AIand the symmetric tensor GI1I2I3. To get rid of factors of wI , we introduce operatorsOI  wIOI . One can choose wI so that a twopoint function computation along thelines of section 3.3.1 leads toOI1xOI20  I1I2x21. 3.48With this choice, the threepoint function, as calculated using 3.44, isOI1 x1OI2 x2OI3 x3 1N123CI1CI2CI3x1  x2123 x1  x3132 x2  x3231,3.49where we have definedCI1CI2CI3  CI1J1JiK1KjCI2J1JiL1LkCI3K1KjL1Lk . 3.50Remarkably, 3.49 is the same result one obtains from free field theory by Wick contracting all the J fields in the three operators. This suggests that there is a nonrenormalization theorem for this correlation function, but such a theorem has not yetbeen proven see however comments at the end of section 3.2.2. It is worth emphasizing that the normalization ambiguity in the bulkboundary coupling is circumventedessentially by considering invariant ratios of threepoint functions and twopoint functions, into which the leg factors wI do not enter. This is the same strategy as waspursued in comparing matrix models of quantum gravity to Liouville theory.883.3.3 Fourpoint FunctionsThe calculation of fourpoint functions is difficult because there are several graphswhich contribute, and some of them inevitably involve bulktobulk propagators offields with spin. The computation of fourpoint functions of the operators O and OCdual to the dilaton and the axion was completed in 271. See also 243, 247, 248,249, 272, 273, 252, 250, 274, 275 for earlier contributions. One of the main technicalresults, further developed in 276, is that diagrams involving an internal propagatorcan be reduced by integration over one of the bulk vertices to a sum of quartic graphsexpressible in terms of the functionsD1234x1, x2, x3, x4 d5xg4i1Kix, z xi,Kx, z y zz2  x y2.3.51The integration is over the bulk point x, z. There are two independent conformallyinvariant combinations of the xis 12x213x224x212x234  x214x223t x212x234  x214x223x212x234  x214x223. 3.52One can write the connected fourpoint function asOx1OCx2Ox3OCx4 624 16x22412s 1D4455 649x224x2131sD3355163x224x2131sD2255  14D4444 469x213D3344 409x213D2244 83x613D1144  64x224D4455.3.53An interesting limit of 3.53 is to take two pairs of points close together. Following271, let us take the pairs x1, x3 and x2, x4 close together while holding x1 and x2a fixed distance apart. Then the existence of an OPE expansion implies thatO1x1O2x2O3x3O4x4 n,mnOnx1Omx2mx13m13 x24n24, 3.54at least as an asymptotic series, and hopefully even with a finite radius of convergencefor x13 and x24. The operators On are the ones that appear in the OPE of O1 with O3,and the operators Om are the ones that appear in the OPE of O2 with O4. O and OCare descendants of chiral primaries, and so have protected dimensions. The productof descendants of chiral fields is not itself necessarily the descendent of a chiral fieldan appropriately normal ordered product  OO  is expected to have an unprotected891 32 4Figure 3.4 A nearly degenerate quartic graph contributing to the fourpoint functionin the limit x13, x24  x12.dimension of the form 8  O1N2. This is the natural result from the field theorypoint of view because there are ON2 degrees of freedom contributing to each factor,and the commutation relations between them are nontrivial only a fraction 1N2 ofthe time. From the supergravity point of view, a composite operator like  OO corresponds to a twoparticle bulk state, and the O1N2  O2R8 correction tothe mass is interpreted as the correction to the mass of the twoparticle state fromgravitational binding energy. Roughly one is thinking of graviton exchange betweenthe legs of figure 3.4 that are nearly coincident.If 3.54 is expanded in inverse powers of N , then the O1N2 correction to nand m shows up to leading order as a term proportional to a logarithm of somecombination of the separations xij . Logarithms also appear in the expansion of 3.53in the x13, x24  x12 limit in which 3.54 applies the leading log in this limit is1x1216logx13x24x212. This is the correct form to be interpreted in terms of the propagationof a twoparticle state dual to an operator whose dimension is slightly different from 8.3.4 Isomorphism of Hilbert SpacesThe AdSCFT correspondence is a statement about the equivalence of two quantumtheories string theory or M theory on AdSp2  compact space and CFTp1. Thetwo quantum theories are equivalent if there is an isomorphism between their Hilbertspaces, and moreover if the operator algebras on the Hilbert spaces are equivalent. Inthis section, we discuss the isomorphism of the Hilbert spaces, following 277, 185, 278,279. Related issues have been discussed in 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288.States in the Hilbert space of CFTp1 fall into representations of the global conformalgroup SO2, p  1 on Rp,1. At the same time, the isometry group of AdS is alsoSO2, p  1, and we can use it to classify states in the string theory. Thus, it is90useful to compare states in the two theories by organizing them into representationsof SO2, p  1. The conformal group SO2, p  1 has 12p  2p  3 generators,Jab  Jba a, b  0, 1,    , p 2, obeying the commutation relationJab, Jcd  igacJbd  permutations 3.55with the metric gab  diag1,1,1,    ,1,1. In CFTp1, they are identifiedwith the Poincare generators P and M , the dilatation D and the special conformalgenerators K ,   0,    , p, by the formulasJp2,p1  D, J,p2 12K  P, J,p1 12K  P, J M . 3.56Since the field theory on Rp,1 has no scale, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian P0 iscontinuous and there is no normalizable ground state with respect to P0. This is alsothe case for the string theory on AdSp2. The Killing vector t corresponding to P0has the normt  Ru, 3.57and it vanishes as u  0. Consequently, a stationary wave solution of the linearizedsupergravity on AdS has a continuous frequency spectrum with respect to the timelikecoordinate t. It is not easy to compare the spectrum of P0 of the two theories.It is more useful to compare the two Hilbert spaces using the maximum compactsubgroup SO2 SOp 1 of the conformal group 277. The Minkowski space Rp,1is conformally embedded in the Einstein Universe R  Sp, and SO2 SOp  1 isits isometry group. In particular, the generator J0,p2 12P0  K0 of SO2 is theHamiltonian for the CFT on R  Sp. Now we have a scale in the problem, which isthe radius of Sp, and the Hamiltonian 12P0 K0 has a mass gap. In string theory onAdSp2, the generator12P0 K0 corresponds to the global time translation along thecoordinate  . This is a globally welldefined coordinate on AdS and the Killing vector is everywhere nonvanishing  Rcos . 3.58Therefore, a stationary wave solution with respect to  is normalizable and has adiscrete frequency spectrum. In fact, as we saw in section 2.2.4, the frequency isquantized in such a way that bosonic fields in the supergravity multiplet are periodicand their superpartners are antiperiodic i.e. obeying the supersymmetry preservingRamond boundary condition in the  direction with the period 2R.3.4.1 Hilbert Space of String TheoryWith the techniques that are currently available, we can make reliable statements aboutthe Hilbert space structure of string theory on AdS only when the curvature radius R91of AdS is much larger than the string length ls. In this section we will study some ofthe properties of the Hilbert space that we can see in the AdS description. We willconcentrate on the AdS5  S5 case, but it is easy to generalize this to other cases.We first consider the case that corresponds to the t Hooft limit gs  0, gsN fixedand large, so that we can trust the gravity approximation.1 E  ms Gas of Free GravitonsThe Hilbert space for low energies is well approximated by the Fock space of gravitonsand their superpartners on AdS5S5. Since  is a globally defined timelike coordinateon AdS, we can consider stationary wave solutions in the linearized supergravity, whichare the normalizable states discussed in section 2.2.2. The frequency  of a stationarymode is quantized in the unit set by the curvature radiusR 2.41, so one may effectivelyview the supergravity particles in AdS as confined in a box of size R.The operator H  12RP0K0 corresponds10 to the Killing vector  on AdS. Thus,a single particle state of frequency  gives an eigenstate of H . Since the supergravitonis a BPS particle, its energy eigenvalue  is exact, free from corrections either byfirst quantized string effects  lsR or by quantum gravity effects  lPR. Theenergy of multiparticle states may receive corrections, but they become important onlywhen the energy E becomes comparable to the gravitational potential E2m8PR7, i.e.E  m8PR7. For the energies we are considering this effect is negligible.Therefore, the Hilbert space for E  ms is identified with the Fock space of freesupergravity particles. For E  R1, the entropy SE  logNE where NE isthe density of states behaves asSE  ER 910 , 3.59since we effectively have a gas in ten dimensions we will ignore multiplicative numericalfactors in the entropy in this section.2 ms  E  msg2s  Gas of Free StringsWhen the energy E becomes comparable to the string scale ms, we have to takeinto account excitations on the string worldsheet. Although we do not know the exactfirst quantized spectrum of string theory on AdS, we can estimate the effects of theworldsheet excitations when ls  R. The mass m of a first quantized string state is afunction of ls and R. When ls  R, the worldsheet dynamics is perturbative and wecan expand m in powers of lsR, with the leading term given by the string spectrumon flat space R  . Therefore, for a string state corresponding to the nth excited10The factor 12R in the relation between H and P0  K0 is fixed by the commutation relations3.55.92level of the string on flat space, the mass2 is given bym2  l2sn Ol2sR2. 3.60Unlike the single particle supergravity states discussed in the previous paragraph, stringexcitations need not carry integral eigenvalues of H in units of R1. As they are notBPS particles, they are generically unstable in string perturbation theory.The free string spectrum in 10 dimensions gives the Hagedorn density of statesSE  Els. 3.61Thus, the entropy of supergravity particles 3.59 becomes comparable to that of excited strings 3.61 whenER910  Els, 3.62namelyE  m10s R9. 3.63For m10s R9  E, excited strings dominate the Hilbert space. The free string formula3.61 is reliable until the energy hits another transition point E  msg2s . We areassuming that R9  l9sg2s , which is true in the t Hooft region.3 msg2s  E  m8PR7 Small Black HoleAs we increase the energy, the gas of free strings starts collapsing to make a blackhole. The black hole can be described by the classical supergravity when the horizonradius r becomes larger than the string length ls. Furthermore, if the horizon sizer is smaller than R, the geometry near the black hole can be approximated by the10dimensional Schwarzschild solution. The energy E and the entropy S of such ablack hole is given byE  m8P r7S  mP r8. 3.64Therefore, the entropy is estimated to beSE  ElP 87 . 3.65We can trust this estimate when ls  r  R, namely m8P l7s  E  m8PR7. Comparing this with the Hagedorn density of states in the regime 2 given by 3.61, we findthat the transition to 3.65 takes place atE  msg2s. 3.6693For E  m8P l7s , the entropy formula 3.65 is reliable and the black hole entropy exceedsthat of the gas of free strings. Therefore, in this regime, the Hilbert space is dominatedby black hole states.4 m8PR7  E Large Black HoleThe above analysis assumes that the size of the black hole, characterized by thehorizon radius r, is small compared to the radii R of AdS5 and S5. As we increasethe energy, the radius r grows and eventually becomes comparable to R. Beyond thispoint, we can no longer use the 10dimensional Schwarzschild solution to estimate thenumber of states. According to 3.64, the horizon size becomes comparable to R whenthe energy of the black hole reaches the scale E  m8PR7. Beyond this energy scale,we have to use a solution which is asymptotically AdS5 289,ds2  frd 2  1frdr2  r2d23, 3.67wherefr  1 r2R2 r2r21 r2R2, 3.68and r  r is the location of the outmost horizon. By studying the asymptoticbehavior of the metric, one finds that the black hole carries the energyE  r2l3P1 r2R2. 3.69Here lP is the fivedimensional Planck length, related to the 10dimensional Planckscale lP and the compactification scale R asl3P  l8PR5. 3.70The entropy of the AdS Schwarzschild solution is given byS rlP3. 3.71For r  R, 3.69 becomes E  r4l3P R2, and the entropy as a function of energy isS ER2lP 34RlP2ER34 . 3.72As the energy increases, the horizon size expands as R  r  , and the supergravity approximation continues to be reliable. For E  , the only stringy and quantumgravity corrections are due to the finite size R of the AdS radius of curvature and of94the compact space, and such corrections are suppressed by factors of lsR and lPR.The leading lsR corrections to 3.72 were studied in 290, and found to be of theorder of lsR3. SummaryThe above analysis gives the following picture about the structure of the Hilbertspace of string theory on AdS when ls  R and gs  1.SEgravitonsfreefree stringssmallblack holelargeblack holeEEEER791087pm8 ls7 mp8ms9 R834Figure 3.5 The behavior of the entropy S as a function of the energy E in AdS5 .1 For energies E  ms, the Hilbert space is the Fock space of supergravity particlesand the spectrum is quantized in the unit of R1. For E  m10s R9, the entropy isgiven by that of the gas of free supergravity particles in 10 dimensionsS  ER 910 . 3.732 For m10s R9  E  m8P l7s , stringy excitations become important, and the entropygrows linearly in energyS  Els. 3.743 For m8P l7s  E  m8PR7, the black hole starts to show up in the Hilbert space.For E  m8PR7, the size of the black hole horizon is smaller than R, and the entropyis given by that of the 10dimensional Schwarzschild solutionS  ElP 87 . 3.75954 For m8PR7  E, the size of the black hole horizon becomes larger than R. We thenhave to use the AdSp2 Schwarzschild solution, and the entropy is given byS RlP2ER34 . 3.76The behavior of the entropy is depicted in figure 3.5.In the small black hole regime 3, the system has a negative specific heat. Thiscorresponds to the wellknown instability of the flat space at finite temperature 291.On the other hand, the AdS Schwarzschild solution has a positive specific heat and itis thermodynamically stable. This means that, if we consider a canonical ensemble,the free string regime 2 and the small black hole regime 3 will be missed. Whenset in contact with a heat bath of temperature T  ms, the system will continue toabsorb heat until its energy reaches E  m8PR7, the threshold of the large black holeregime 4. In fact the jump from 1 to 4 takes place at much lower temperaturesince the temperature equivalent of E  m8PR7 derived from 3.76 in the regime 4is T  R1. Therefore, once the temperature is raised to T  R1 a black hole forms.The behavior of the canonical ensemble will be discussed in more detail in section 3.6.Finally let us notice that in the case that gs  1 we do not have the Hagedorn phase,and we go directly from the gas of gravitons to the small black hole phase.3.4.2 Hilbert Space of Conformal Field TheoryNext, let us turn to a discussion of the Hilbert space of the CFTp1. The generatorJ0,p2 12P0  K0 is the Hamiltonian of the CFT on Sp with the unit radius. Inthe Euclidean CFT, the conformal group SO2, p 1 turns into SO1, p  2 by theWick rotation, and the Hamiltonian 12P0  K0 and the dilatation operator D canbe rotated into each other by an internal isomorphism of the group. Therefore, ifthere is a conformal field hx of dimension h with respect to the dilatation D, thenthere is a corresponding eigenstate h of 12P0 K0 on Sp with the same eigenvalueh. In twodimensional conformal field theory, this phenomenon is wellknown as thestateoperator correspondence, but in fact it holds for any CFTp1 hx  h  hx  00. 3.77As discussed in section 3.2.1, in maximally supersymmetric cases there is a onetoone correspondence between chiral primary operators of CFTp1 and the supergravityparticles on the dual AdSp2  compact space. This makes it possible to identify astate in the Fock space of the supergravity particles on AdS with a state in the CFTHibert space generated by the chiral primary fields.96To be specific, let us consider the N  4 SUN super YangMills theory in fourdimensions and its dual, type IIB string theory on AdS5S5. The string scale ms andthe 10dimensional Planck scale mP are related to the gauge theory parameters, gYMand N , byms  g2YMN14R1, mP  N14R1. 3.78The four energy regimes of string theory on AdS5  S5 are translated into the gaugetheory energy scales measured in the units of the inverse S3 radius in the t Hooftlimit as follows1 E  g2YMN14The Hilbert space consists of the chiral primary states, their superconformal descendants and their products. Because of the largeN factorization, a product of gaugeinvariant operators receives corrections only at subleading orders in the 1N expansion. This fits well with the supergravity description of multigraviton states, where weestimated that their energy E becomes comparable to the gravitational potential whenE  m8PR7, which in the gauge theory scale corresponds to E  N2. The entropy for1  E  g2YMN14 is then given byS  E 910 . 3.792 g2YMN14  E  g2YMN72N2Each single string state is identified with a single trace operator in the gauge theory.Supergravity particles correspond to chiral primary states and stringy excitations tononchiral primaries. Since stringy excitations have an energy  ms, the AdSCFTcorrespondence requires that nonchiral conformal fields have to have large anomalousdimensions   msR  g2YMN14 . In the t Hooft limit N  g2YMN for any ,we can consider the regime g2YMN52  E  g2YMN72N2 where the entropy showsthe Hagedorn behaviorS  g2YMN14E. 3.80Apparently, the entropy in this regime is dominated by the nonchiral fields.3 g2YMN 72N2  E  N2The string theory Hilbert space consists of states in the small black hole. It would beinteresting to find a gauge theory interpretation of the 10dimensional Schwarzschildblack hole. The entropy in this regime behaves asS  N 27E 87 . 3.814 N2  EThe string theory Hilbert space consists of states in the large black hole. The entropyis given byS  N 12E 34 . 3.8297The E34 scaling of the entropy is what one expects for a conformal field theory in 31dimensions at high energies compared to the radius of the sphere. It is interestingto note that the N dependence of S is the same as that of N2 free particles in 3  1dimensions, although the precise numerical coefficient in S differs from the one thatis obtained from the number of particles in the N  4 YangMills multiplet by anumerical factor 292.3.5 Wilson LoopsIn this section we consider Wilson loop operators in the gauge theory. The Wilson loopoperatorW C  TrP expiCA3.83depends on a loop C embedded in four dimensional space, and it involves the pathordered integral of the gauge connection along the contour. The trace is taken oversome representation of the gauge group we will discuss here only the case of thefundamental representation see 293 for a discussion of other representations. Fromthe expectation value of the Wilson loop operator W C we can calculate the quarkantiquark potential. For this purpose we consider a rectangular loop with sides oflength T and L in Euclidean space. Then, viewing T as the time direction, it is clearthat for large T the expectation value will behave as eTE where E is the lowest possibleenergy of the quarkantiquark configuration. Thus, we haveW   eTV L , 3.84where V L is the quark antiquark potential. For large N and large g2YMN , theAdSCFT correspondence maps the computation of W  in the CFT into a problemof finding a minimum surface in AdS 294, 295.3.5.1 Wilson Loops and Minimum SurfacesIn QCD, we expect the Wilson loop to be related to the string running from the quark tothe antiquark. We expect this string to be analogous to the string in our configuration,which is a superstring which lives in ten dimensions, and which can stretch betweentwo points on the boundary of AdS. In order to motivate this prescription let usconsider the following situation. We start with the gauge group UN  1, and webreak it to UN  U1 by giving an expectation value to one of the scalars. Thiscorresponds, as discussed in section 3.1, to having a D3 brane sitting at some radialposition U in AdS, and at a point on S5. The offdiagonal states, transforming in theN of UN, get a mass proportional to U , m  U2. So, from the point of view of98the UN gauge theory, we can view these states as massive quarks, which act as asource for the various UN fields. Since they are charged they will act as a source forthe vector fields. In order to get a nondynamical source an external quark with nofluctuations of its own, which will correspond precisely to the Wilson loop operatorwe need to take m  , which means U should also go to infinity. Thus, the stringshould end on the boundary of AdS space.These stretched strings will also act as a source for the scalar fields. The coupling tothe scalar fields can be seen qualitatively by viewing the quarks as strings stretchingbetween the N branes and the single separated brane. These strings will pull the Nbranes and will cause a deformation of the branes, which is described by the scalarfields. A more formal argument for this coupling is that these states are BPS, andthe coupling to the scalar Higgs fields is determined by supersymmetry. Finally, onecan see this coupling explicitly by writing the full UN  1 Lagrangian, putting inthe Higgs expectation value and calculating the equation of motion for the massivefields 294. The precise definition of the Wilson loop operator corresponding to thesuperstring will actually include also the field theory fermions, which will imply someparticular boundary conditions for the worldsheet fermions at the boundary of AdS.However, this will not affect the leading order computations we describe here.So, the final conclusion is that the stretched strings couple to the operatorW C  TrP expiAx  IIx2d, 3.85where x is any parametrization of the loop and I I  1,    , 6 is a unit vector inR6 the point on S5 where the string is sitting. This is the expression when the signature of R4 is Euclidean. In the Minkowski signature case, the phase factor associatedto the trajectory of the quark has an extra factor i in front of I 11.Generalizing the prescription of section 3.3 for computing correlation functions, thediscussion above implies that in order to compute the expectation value of the operator3.85 in N  4 SYM we should consider the string theory partition function onAdS5  S5, with the condition that we have a string worldsheet ending on the loop C,as in figure 3.6 295, 294. In the supergravity regime, when gsN is large, the leadingcontribution to this partition function will come from the area of the string worldsheet.This area is measured with the AdS metric, and it is generally not the same as thearea enclosed by the loop C in four dimensions.The area as defined above is divergent. The divergence arises from the fact thatthe string worldsheet is going all the way to the boundary of AdS. If we evaluatethe area up to some radial distance U  r, we see that for large r it diverges as11The difference in the factor of i between the Euclidean and the Minkowski cases can be traced tothe analytic continuation ofx2. A detailed derivation of 3.85 can be found in 296.99Figure 3.6 The Wilson loop operator creates a string worldsheet ending on the corresponding loop on the boundary of AdS.rC, where C is the length of the loop in the field theory 294, 295. On the otherhand, the perturbative computation in the field theory shows that W , for W givenby 3.85, is finite, as it should be since a divergence in the Wilson loop would haveimplied a mass renormalization of the BPS particle. The apparent discrepancy betweenthe divergence of the area of the minimum surface in AdS and the finiteness of thefield theory computation can be reconciled by noting that the appropriate action forthe string worldsheet is not the area itself but its Legendre transform with respect tothe string coordinates corresponding to I and the radial coordinate u 296. This isbecause these string coordinates obey the Neumann boundary conditions rather thanthe Dirichlet conditions. When the loop is smooth, the Legendre transformation simplysubtracts the divergent term rC, leaving the resulting action finite.As an example let us consider a circular Wilson loop. Take C to be a circle of radiusa on the boundary, and let us work in the Poincare coordinates defined in section2.2. We could find the surface that minimizes the area by solving the EulerLagrangeequations. However, in this case it is easier to use conformal invariance. Note thatthere is a conformal transformation in the field theory that maps a line to a circle. Inthe case of the line, the minimum area surface is clearly a plane that intersects theboundary and goes all the way to the horizon which is just a point on the boundaryin the Euclidean case. Using the conformal transformation to map the line to a circlewe obtain the minimal surface we want. It is, using the coordinates 3.17 for AdS5,x a2  z2e1 cos   e2 sin , 3.86where e1, e2 are two orthonormal vectors in four dimensions which define the orientation of the circle and 0  z  a. We can calculate the area of this surface in AdS,and we get a contribution to the actionS  12A  R22d adzaz2R2a 1, 3.87100where we have regularized the area by putting a an IR cutoff at z   in AdS, whichis equivalent to a UV cutoff in the field theory 175. Subtracting the divergent termwe getW   eS  eR2  e4gsN . 3.88This is independent of a as required by conformal invariance.We could similarly consider a magnetic Wilson loop, which is also called a t Hooftloop 297. This case is related by electricmagnetic duality to the previous case. Sincewe identify the electricmagnetic duality with the SL2,Z duality of type IIB stringtheory, we should consider in this case a Dstring worldsheet instead of a fundamentalstring worldsheet. We get the same result as in 3.88 but with gs  1gs.Using 3.84 it is possible to compute the quarkantiquark potential in the supergravity approximation 295, 294. In this case we consider a configuration which is invariantunder Euclidean time translations. We take both particles to have the same scalarcharge, which means that the two ends of the string are at the same point in S5 onecould consider also the more general case with a string ending at different points on S5294. We put the quark at x  L2 and the antiquark at x  L2. Here quarkmeans an infinitely massive Wboson connecting the N branes with one brane whichis infinitely far away. The classical action for a string worldsheet isS 12dddetGMNXMXN, 3.89where GMN is the Euclidean AdS5  S5 metric. Note that the factors of  cancelout in 3.89, as they should. Since we are interested in a static configuration we take  t,   x, and then the action becomesS TR22 L2L2dxxz2  1z2. 3.90We need to solve the EulerLagrange equations for this action. Since the action doesnot depend on x explicitly the solution satisfies1z2xz2  1 constant. 3.91Defining z0 to be the maximum value of zx, which by symmetry occurs at x  0, wefind that the solution is12x  z0 1zz0dyy21 y4 , 3.9212All integrals in this section can be calculated in terms of elliptic or Beta functions.101where z0 is determined by the conditionL2 z0 10dyy21 y4  z0232142. 3.93The qualitative form of the solution is shown in figure 3.7b. Notice that the stringquickly approaches x  L2 for small z close to the boundary,L2 x  z3 , z  0 . 3.94Now we compute the total energy of the configuration. We just plug in the solution3.92 in 3.90, subtract the infinity as explained above which can be interpreted asthe energy of two separated massive quarks, as in figure 3.7a, and we findE  V L  422g2YMN12144L. 3.95We see that the energy goes as 1L, a fact which is determined by conformal invariance.Note that the energy is proportional to g2YMN12, as opposed to g2YMN which is theperturbative result. This indicates some screening of the charges at strong coupling.The above calculation makes sense for all distances L when gsN is large, independentlyof the value of gs. Some subleading corrections coming from quantum fluctuations ofthe worldsheet were calculated in 298, 299, 300.In a similar fashion we could compute the potential between two magnetic monopolesin terms of a Dstring worldsheet, and the result will be the same as 3.95 but withgYM  4gYM . One can also calculate the interaction between a magnetic monopoleand a quark. In this case the fundamental string ending on the quark will attach tothe Dstring ending on the monopole, and they will connect to form a 1, 1 stringwhich will go into the horizon. The resulting potential is a complicated function ofgYM 301, but in the limit that gYM is small but still with g2YMN large we getthat the monopolequark potential is just 14 of the quarkquark potential. This canbe understood from the fact that when g is small the Dstring is very rigid and thefundamental string will end almost perpendicularly on the Dstring. Therefore, thesolution for the fundamental string will be half of the solution we had above, leadingto a factor of 14 in the potential. Calculations of Wilson loops in the Higgs phasewere done in 302.Another interesting case one can study analytically is a surface near a cusp on R4.In this case, the perturbative computation in the gauge theory shows a logarithmicdivergence with a coefficient depending on the angle at the cusp. The area of theminimum surface also contains a logarithmic divergence depending on the angle 296.Other aspects of the gravity calculation of Wilson loops were discussed in 303, 304,305, 306, 307.102LU0U 8a bxUFigure 3.7 a Initial configuration corresponding to two massive quarks before weturn on their coupling to the UN gauge theory. b Configuration after we considerthe coupling to the UN gauge theory. This configuration minimizes the action. Thequarkantiquark energy is given by the difference of the total length of the strings ina and b.3.5.2 Other Branes Ending on the BoundaryWe could also consider other branes that are ending at the boundary 308. Thesimplest example would be a zerobrane i.e. a particle of mass m. In Euclideanspace a zerobrane describes a one dimensional trajectory in antideSitter space whichends at two points on the boundary. Therefore, it is associated with the insertion oftwo local operators at the two points where the trajectory ends. In the supergravityapproximation the zerobrane follows a geodesic. Geodesics in the hyperbolic planeEuclidean AdS are semicircles. If we compute the action we getS  mds  2mR aadzza2  z2 , 3.96where we took the distance between the two points at the boundary to be L  2a andregulated the result. We find a logarithmic divergence when   0, proportional tologa. If we subtract the logarithmic divergence we get a residual dependence on a.Naively we might have thought that as in the previous subsection the answer had tobe independent of a due to conformal invariance. In fact, the dependence on a is veryimportant, since it leads to a result of the formeS  e2mR log a  1a2mR, 3.97103which is precisely the result we expect for the twopoint function of an operator ofdimension   mR. This is precisely the large mR limit of the formula 3.14, sowe reproduce in the supergravity limit the 2point function described in section 3.3.In general, this sort of logarithmic divergence arises when the brane worldvolume isodd dimensional 308, and it implies that the expectation value of the correspondingoperator depends on the overall scale. In particular one could consider the Wilsonsurfaces that arise in the six dimensional N  2, 0 theory which will be discussed insection 6.1.1. In that case one has to consider a twobrane, with a three dimensionalworldvolume, ending on a two dimensional surface on the boundary of AdS7. Again,one gets a logarithmic term, which is proportional to the rigid string action of the twodimensional surface living on the string in the N  2, 0 field theory 309, 308.One can also compute correlation functions involving more than one Wilson loop.To leading order in N this will be just the product of the expectation values of eachWilson loop. On general grounds one expects that the subleading corrections are givenby surfaces that end on more than one loop. One limiting case is when the surfaces looksimilar to the zeroth order surfaces but with additional thin tubes connecting them.These thin tubes are nothing else than massless particles being exchanged between thetwo string worldsheets 293, 309. We will discuss this further in section 6.2.3.6 Theories at Finite TemperatureAs discussed in section 3.2, the quantities that can be most successfully comparedbetween gauge theory and string theory are those with some protection from supersymmetry andor conformal invariance  for instance, dimensions of chiral primaryoperators. Finite temperature breaks both supersymmetry and conformal invariance,and the insights we gain from examining the T  0 physics will be of a more qualitative nature. They are no less interesting for that we shall see in section 3.6.1 how theentropy of nearextremal D3branes comes out identical to the free field theory prediction up to a factor of a power of 43 then in section 3.6.2 we explain how a phasetransition studied by Hawking and Page in the context of quantum gravity is mappedinto a confinementdeconfinement transition in the gauge theory, driven by finitesizeeffects and in section 6.2 we will summarize the attempts to use holographic duals offinitetemperature field theories to learn about pure gauge theory at zero temperaturebut in one lower dimension.3.6.1 ConstructionThe gravity solution describing the gauge theory at finite temperature can be obtainedby starting from the general black threebrane solution 1.12 and taking the decoupling104limit of section 3.1 keeping the energy density above extremality finite. The resultingmetric can be written asds2  R2u2hdt2  dx21  dx22  dx23 du2hu2 d25h  1 u40u4, u0  T.3.98It will often be useful to Wick rotate by setting tE  it, and use the relation betweenthe finite temperature theory and the Euclidean theory with a compact time direction.The first computation which indicated that finitetemperature UN YangMills theory might be a good description of the microstates of N coincident D3branes was thecalculation of the entropy 292, 310. On the supergravity side, the entropy of nearextremal D3branes is just the usual BekensteinHawking result, S  A4GN , and itis expected to be a reliable guide to the entropy of the gauge theory at large N andlarge g2YMN . There is no problem on the gauge theory side in working at large N ,but large g2YMN at finite temperature is difficult indeed. The analysis of 292 waslimited to a free field computation in the field theory, but nevertheless the two resultsfor the entropy agreed up to a factor of a power of 43. In the canonical ensemble,where temperature and volume are the independent variables, one identifies the fieldtheory volume with the worldvolume of the D3branes, and one sets the field theorytemperature equal to the Hawking temperature in supergravity. The result isFSUGRA  28N2V T 4,FSYM 43FSUGRA .3.99The supergravity result is at leading order in lsR, and it would acquire correctionssuppressed by powers of TR if we had considered the full D3brane metric rather thanthe nearhorizon limit, 3.98. These corrections do not have an interpretation in thecontext of CFT because they involve R as an intrinsic scale. Two equivalent methodsto evaluate FSUGRA are a to use F  E  TS together with standard expressions forthe BekensteinHawking entropy, the Hawking temperature, and the ADM mass andb to consider the gravitational action of the Euclidean solution, with a periodicity inthe Euclidean time direction related to the temperature which eliminates a conicaldeficit angle at the horizon.13The 43 factor is a longstanding puzzle into which we still have only qualitative insight. The gauge theory computation was performed at zero t Hooft coupling, whereas13The result of 292, SSYM  4314SSUGRA, differs superficially from 3.99, but it is onlybecause the authors worked in the microcanonical ensemble rather than identifying the Hawkingtemperature with the field theory temperature, the ADM mass above extremality was identified withthe field theory energy.105the supergravity is supposed to be valid at strong t Hooft coupling, and unlike in the11dimensional case where the entropy is essentially fixed by the central charge, thereis no nonrenormalization theorem for the coefficient of T 4 in the free energy. Indeed,it was suggested in 290 that the leading term in the 1N expansion of F has the formF  fg2YMN26N2V T 4, 3.100where fg2YMN is a function which smoothly interpolates between a weak couplinglimit of 1 and a strong coupling limit of 34. It was pointed out early 311 that thequartic potential g2YMTrI , J 2 in the N  4 YangMills action might be expectedto freeze out more and more degrees of freedom as the coupling was increased, whichwould suggest that fg2YMN is monotone decreasing. An argument has been given312, based on the nonrenormalization of the twopoint function of the stress tensor,that fg2YMN should remain finite at strong coupling.The leading corrections to the limiting value of fg2YMN at strong and weak couplingwere computed in 290 and 313, respectively. The results arefg2YMN  1322g2YMN  . . . for small g2YMN ,fg2YMN 3445323g2YMN32 . . . for large g2YMN .3.101The weak coupling result is a straightforward although somewhat tedious applicationof the diagrammatic methods of perturbative finitetemperature field theory. Theconstant term is from one loop, and the leading correction is from two loops. The strongcoupling result follows from considering the leading  corrections to the supergravityaction. The relevant one involves a particular contraction of four powers of the Weyltensor. It is important now to work with the Euclidean solution, and one restrictsattention further to the nearhorizon limit. The Weyl curvature comes from the noncompact part of the metric, which is no longer AdS5 but rather the AdSSchwarzschildsolution which we will discuss in more detail in section 3.6.2. The action includingthe  corrections no longer has the EinsteinHilbert form, and correspondingly theBekensteinHawking prescription no longer agrees with the free energy computed as Iwhere I is the Euclidean action. In keeping with the basic prescription for computingGreens functions, where a free energy in field theory is equated in the appropriatelimit with a supergravity action, the relation I  F is regarded as the correctone. See 314. It has been conjectured that the interpolating function fg2YMNis not smooth, but exhibits some phase transition at a finite value of the t Hooftcoupling. We regard this as an unsettled question. The arguments in 315, 316 seemas yet incomplete. In particular, they rely on analyticity properties of the perturbationexpansion which do not seem to be proven for finite temperature field theories.1063.6.2 Thermal Phase TransitionThe holographic prescription of 19, 20, applied at large N and g2YMN where loop andstringy corrections are negligible, involves extremizing the supergravity action subjectto particular asymptotic boundary conditions. We can think of this as the saddle pointapproximation to the path integral over supergravity fields. That path integral is illdefined because of the nonrenormalizable nature of supergravity. String amplitudeswhen we can calculate them render onshell quantities welldefined. Despite the conceptual difficulties we can use some simple intuition about path integrals to illustratean important point about the AdSCFT correspondence namely, there can be morethan one saddle point in the range of integration, and when there is we should sumeISUGRA over the classical configurations to obtain the saddlepoint approximation tothe gauge theory partition function. Multiple classical configurations are possible because of the general feature of boundary value problems in differential equations therecan be multiple solutions to the classical equations satisfying the same asymptoticboundary conditions. The solution which globally minimizes ISUGRA is the one thatdominates the path integral.When there are two or more solutions competing to minimize ISUGRA, there canbe a phase transition between them. An example of this was studied in 289 longbefore the AdSCFT correspondence, and subsequently resurrected, generalized, andreinterpreted in 20, 185 as a confinementdeconfinement transition in the gauge theory.Since the qualitative features are independent of the dimension, we will restrict ourattention to AdS5. It is worth noting however that if the AdS5 geometry is part of astring compactification, it doesnt matter what the internal manifold is except insofaras it fixes the cosmological constant, or equivalently the radius R of antide Sitterspace.There is an embedding of the Schwarzschild black hole solution into antide Sitterspace which extremizes the actionI   116G5d5xgR 12R2. 3.102Explicitly, the metric isds2  fdt2 1fdr2  r2d23,f  1 r2R2 r2.3.103The radial variable r is restricted to r  r, where r is the largest root of f  0. TheEuclidean time is periodically identified, t  t  , in order to eliminate the conical107singularity at r  r. This requires 2R2r2r2 R2. 3.104Topologically, this space is S3B2, and the boundary is S3S1 which is the relevantspace for the field theory on S3 with finite temperature. We will call this space X2.Another space with the same boundary which is also a local extremum of 3.102 isgiven by the metric in 3.103 with   0 and again with periodic time. This space,which we will call X1, is not only metrically distinct from the first being locally conformally flat, but also topologically B4  S1 rather than S3  B2. Because the S1factor is not simply connected, there are two possible spin structures on X1, corresponding to thermal antiperiodic or supersymmetric periodic boundary conditionson fermions. In contrast, X2 is simply connected and hence admits a unique spinstructure, corresponding to thermal boundary conditions. For the purpose of computing the twisted partition function, Tr1F eH , in a saddlepoint approximation, onlyX1 contributes. But, X1 and X2 make separate saddlepoint contributions to the usualthermal partition function, TreH , and the more important one is the one with thesmaller Euclidean action.Actually, both IX1 and IX2 are infinite, so to compute IX2IX1 a regulationscheme must be adopted. The one used in 185, 290 is to cut off both X1 and X2 at adefinite coordinate radius r  R0. For X2, the elimination of the conical deficit angleat the horizon fixes the period of Euclidean time but for X1, the period is arbitrary.In order to make the comparison of IX1 and IX2 meaningful, we fix the period ofEuclidean time on X1 so that the proper circumference of the S1 at r  R0 is the sameas the proper length on X2 of an orbit of the Killing vector t, also at r  R0. Inthe limit R0  , one findsIX2 IX1 2r3R2  r24G52r2 R2, 3.105where again r is the largest root of f  0. The fact that 3.105 or more preciselyits AdS4 analog can change its sign was interpreted in 289 as indicating a phasetransition between a black hole in AdS and a thermal gas of particles in AdS whichis the natural interpretation of the space X1. The black hole is the thermodynamically favored state when the horizon radius r exceeds the radius of curvature R ofAdS. In the gauge theory we interpret this transition as a confinementdeconfinementtransition. Since the theory is conformally invariant, the transition temperature mustbe proportional to the inverse radius of the space S3 which the field theory lives on.Similar transitions, and also local thermodynamic instability due to negative specificheats, have been studied in the context of spinning branes and charged black holes108in 317, 318, 319, 142, 141, 320, 321. Most of these works are best understood onthe CFT side as explorations of exotic thermal phenomena in finitetemperature gaugetheories. Connections with Higgsed states in gauge theory are clearer in 322, 323.The relevance to confinement is explored in 320. See also 324, 325, 326, 285 forother interesting contributions to the finite temperature literature.Deconfinement at high temperature can be characterized by a spontaneous breakingof the center of the gauge group. In our case the gauge group is SUN and its centeris ZN . The order parameter for the breaking of the center is the expectation value ofthe Polyakov temporal loop W C. The boundary of the spaces X1, X2 is S3  S1,and the path C wraps around the circle. An element of the center g  ZN acts on thePolyakov loop by W C  gW C. The expectation value of the Polyakov loopmeasures the change of the free energy of the system FqT  induced by the presenceof the external charge q, W C  exp FqT T . In a confining phase FqT  isinfinite and therefore W C  0. In the deconfined phase FqT  is finite and thereforeW C 6 0.As discussed in section 3.5, in order to compute W C we have to evaluate thepartition function of strings with a worldsheet D that is bounded by the loop C.Consider first the low temperature phase. The relevant space is X1 which, as discussedabove, has the topology B4S1. The contour C wraps the circle and is not homotopicto zero in X1. Therefore C is not a boundary of any D, which immediately impliesthat W C  0. This is the expected behavior at low temperatures compared tothe inverse radius of the S3, where the center of the gauge group is not broken.For the high temperature phase the relevant space is X2, which has the topologyS3  B2. The contour C is now a boundary of a string worldsheet D  B2 times apoint in S3. This seems to be in agreement with the fact that in the high temperaturephase W C 6 0 and the center of the gauge group is broken. It was pointed outin 185 that there is a subtlety with this argument, since the center should not bebroken in finite volume S3, but only in the infinite volume limit R3. Indeed, thesolution X2 is not unique and we can add to it an expectation value for the integralof the NSNS 2form field B on B2, with vanishing field strength. This is an angularparameter  with period 2, which contributes i to the string worldsheet action. Thestring theory partition function includes now an integral over all values of , makingW C  0 on S3. In contrast, on R3 one integrates over the local fluctuations of but not over its vacuum expectation value. Now W C 6 0 and depends on thevalue of   U1, which may be understood as the dependence on the center ZN inthe large N limit. Explicit computations of Polyakov loops at finite temperature weredone in 327, 328.In 185 the Euclidean black hole solution 3.103 was suggested to be holographicallydual to a theory related to pure QCD in three dimensions. In the large volume limit109the solution corresponds to the N  4 gauge theory on R3S1 with thermal boundaryconditions, and when the S1 is made small corresponding to high temperature T  thetheory at distances larger than 1T effectively reduces to pure YangMills on R3. Someof the nontrivial successes of this approach to QCD will be discussed in section 6.2.110Chapter 4More on the Correspondence4.1 Other AdS5 BackgroundsUp to now we have limited our discussion to the AdS5  S5 background of type IIBstring theory in section 4.3 we will describe backgrounds which are related to it bydeformations. However, it is clear from the description of the correspondence in sections3.1 and 3.3 that a similar correspondence may be defined for any theory of quantumgravity whose metric includes an AdS5 factor the generalization of equation 3.13relates such a theory to a four dimensional conformal field theory. The backgrounddoes not necessarily have to be of the form AdS5  X it is enough that it has anSO4, 2 isometry symmetry, and more general possibilities in which the curvature ofAdS5 depends on the position in X are also possible 121. It is necessary, however,for the AdS theory to be a theory of quantum gravity, since any conformal theoryhas an energymomentum tensor operator that is mapped by the correspondence tothe graviton on AdS51. Thus, we would like to discuss compactifications of stringtheory or M theory, which are believed to be consistent theories of quantum gravity,on backgrounds involving AdS5. For simplicity we will only discuss here backgroundswhich are direct products of the form AdS5 X.Given such a background of stringM theory, it is not apriori clear what is theconformal field theory to which it corresponds. A special class of backgrounds arethose which arise as nearhorizon limits of branes, like the AdS5  S5 background.In this case one can sometimes analyze the lowenergy field theory on the branes bystandard methods before taking the nearhorizon limit, and after the limit this becomesthe dual conformal field theory. The most wellstudied case is the case of D3branesin type IIB string theory. When the D3branes are at a generic point in spacetime1If we have a topological field theory on the boundary the bulk theory does not have to be gravitational, as in 329.111the nearhorizon limit gives the AdS5  S5 background discussed extensively above.However, if the transverse space to the D3branes is singular, the nearhorizon limitand the corresponding field theory can be different. The simplest case is the case of aD3brane on an orbifold 330 or orientifold 216 singularity, which can be analyzed byperturbative string theory methods. These cases will be discussed in sections 4.1.1 and4.1.2. Another interesting case is the conifold singularity 217 and its generalizations,which will be discussed in section 4.1.3. In this case a direct analysis of the field theoryis not possible, but various indirect arguments can be used to determine what it is inmany cases.Not much is known about more general cases of nearhorizon limits of D3branes,which on the string theory side were analyzed in 331, 332, 333, 334, 335, and evenless is known about backgrounds which are not describable as nearhorizon limits ofbranes several AdS5 backgrounds were discussed in 336. An example of the latteris the AdS5 CP3 background of M theory 337, which involves a 4form flux on the4cycle in CP3. Using the methods described in the previous sections we can computevarious properties of such compactifications in the large N limit, such as the massspectrum and the central charge of the corresponding field theories for the AdS5CP3compactification one finds a central charge proportional to N3, where N is the 4formflux. However, it is not known how to construct an alternative description of theconformal field theory in most of these cases, except for the cases which are related bydeformations to the betterunderstood orbifold and conifold compactifications.Some of the AdS5  X backgrounds of stringM theory preserve some number ofsupersymmetries, but most of them such as the AdS5  CP3 background do not.In supersymmetric cases, supersymmetry guarantees the stability of the correspondingsolutions. In the nonsupersymmetric cases various instabilities may arise for finite Nsee, for instance, 338, 339 which may destroy the conformal SO4, 2 invariance,but the correspondence is still conjectured to be valid when all quantum correctionsare taken into account or in the infinite N limit for which the supergravity approximation is valid. One type of instability occurs when the spectrum includes a tachyonicfield whose mass is below the BreitenlohnerFreedman stability bound. Such a field isexpected to condense just like a tachyon in flat space, and generally it is not knownwhat this condensation leads to. If the classical supergravity spectrum includes a fieldwhich saturates the stability bound, an analysis of the quantum corrections is necessary to determine whether they raise the mass squared of the field leading to a stablesolution or lower it leading to an unstable solution. Apriori one would not expectto have a field which exactly saturates the bound corresponding to an operator inthe field theory whose dimension is exactly   2 in a nonsupersymmetric theory,but this often happens in orbifold theories for reasons that will be discussed below.Another possible instability arises when there is a massless field in the background,112corresponding to a marginal operator in the field theory. Such a field the dilatonexists in all classical type IIB compactifications, and naively corresponds to an exactlymarginal deformation of the theory even in the nonsupersymmetric cases. However,for finite N one would expect quantum corrections to generate a potential for such afield if it is neutral under the gauge symmetries, which could drive its expectationvalue away from the range of values where the supergravity approximation is valid.Again, an analysis of the quantum corrections is necessary in such a case to determineif the theory has a stable vacuum which may or may not be describable in supergravity, corresponding to a fixed point of the corresponding field theory, or if the potentialleads to a runaway behavior with no stable vacuum. Another possible source of instabilities is related to the possibility of forming braneantibrane pairs in the vacuum or,equivalently, the emission of branes which destabilize the vacuum 340, 341, 342, 343one would expect such an instability to arise, for example, in cases where we look atthe nearhorizon limit of N 3branes which have a repulsive force between them. Forall these reasons, the study of nonsupersymmetric backgrounds usually requires anunderstanding of the quantum corrections, which are not yet wellunderstood either inM theory or in type IIB compactifications with RR backgrounds. Thus, we will focushere on supersymmetric backgrounds, for which the supergravity approximation is generally valid. In the nonsupersymmetric cases the correspondence is still expected tobe valid, and in the extreme large N limit it can also be studied using supergravity, butgetting finite N information usually requires going beyond the SUGRA approximation.It would be very interesting to understand better the quantum corrections in order tostudy nonsupersymmetric theories at finite N using the AdSCFT correspondence.4.1.1 Orbifolds of AdS5  S5The lowenergy field theory corresponding to D3branes at orbifold singularities may bederived by string theory methods 344, 345. Generally the gauge group is of the formi UaiN, and there are various bifundamental and sometimes also adjoint matterfields2. We are interested in the nearhorizon limit of D3branes sitting at the origin ofR4R6 for some finite group  which is a discrete subgroup of the SO6  SU4Rrotation symmetry 330. If   SU3  SU4R the theory on the D3branes hasN  1 supersymmetry, and if   SU2  SU4R it has N  2 supersymmetry. Thenearhorizon limit of such a configuration is of the form AdS5S5 since the orbifoldcommutes with taking the nearhorizon limit, and corresponds at least for large N2In general one can choose to have the orbifold group act on the ChanPaton indices in variousways. We will discuss here only the case where the group acts as N copies of the regular representationof the orbifold group , which is the only case which leads to conformal theories. Other representationsinvolve also 5branes wrapped around 2cycles, so they do not arise in the naive nearhorizon limit ofD3branes. The AdS5 description of this was given in 218.113to a conformal theory with the appropriate amount of supersymmetry. Note that onneither side of the correspondence is the orbifolding just a projection on the invariantstates of the original theory  on the string theory side we need to add also twistedsectors, while on the field theory side the gauge group is generally much larger thoughthe field theory can be viewed as a projection of the gauge theory corresponding todim N Dbranes.We will start with a general analysis of the orbifold, and then discuss specific examples with different amounts of supersymmetry3. The action of  on the S5 is thesame as its action on the angular coordinates of R6. If the original action of  hadonly the origin as its fixed point, the space S5 is smooth. On the other hand, if theoriginal action had a space of fixed points, some fixed points remain, and the spaceS5 includes orbifold singularities. In this case the space is not geometrically smooth,and the supergravity approximation is not valid though of course in string theory it isa standard orbifold compactification which is generically not singular. The spectrumof string theory on AdS5  S5 includes states from untwisted and twisted sectors ofthe orbifold. The untwisted states are just the projection of the original states ofAdS5  S5, and they include in particular the invariant supergravity states. Thesestates have in the classical supergravity limit the same masses as in the originalAdS5  S5 background 347, corresponding to integer dimensions in the field theory,which is why we often find in orbifolds operators of dimension 2 or 4 which can destabilize nonsupersymmetric backgrounds. If the orbifold group has fixed points on theS5, there are also light twisted sector states that are localized near these fixed points,which need to be added to the supergravity fields for a proper description of the lowenergy dynamics. On the other hand, if the orbifold has no fixed points, all twistedsector states are heavy,4 since they involve strings stretching between identified pointson the S5. In this case the twisted sector states decouple from the lowenergy theoryin spacetime for large gsN. There is a global  symmetry in the corresponding fieldtheory, under which the untwisted sector states are neutral while the twisted sectorstates are charged.In the t Hooft limit of N   with gsN finite, all the solutions of the formAdS5  S5 have a fixed line corresponding to the dilaton, indicating that the betafunction of the corresponding field theories vanishes in this limit 330. In fact, onecan prove 348, 349, 350 see also 351, 352 that in this limit, which corresponds tokeeping only the planar diagrams in the field theory, all the correlation functions of theuntwisted sector operators in the orbifold theories are the same up to multiplication3We will not discuss here orbifolds that act nontrivially on the AdS space, as in 346.4Note that this happens even when in the original description there were massless twisted sectorstates localized at the origin.114by some power of dim as in the N  4 SYM theory corresponding to AdS5S5 5.This is the analog of the usual string theory statement that at treelevel the interactionsof untwisted sector states are exactly inherited from those of the original theory beforethe orbifolding. For example, the central charge of the field theory appearing in the2point function of the energymomentum tensor is in this limit just dim timesthe central charge of the corresponding N  4 theory. This may easily be seen alsoon the string theory side, where the central charge may be shown 173 to be inverselyproportional to the volume of the compact space and VolS5  VolS5dim.The vanishing of the beta function in the t Hooft limit follows from this generalresult as predicted by the AdSCFT correspondence. This applies both to orbifoldswhich preserve supersymmetry and to those which do not, and leads to many examplesof supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric theories which have fixed lines in the largeN limit. At subleading orders in 1N , the correlation functions differ between theorbifold theory and the N  4 theory, and in principle a nonzero beta functionmay arise. In supersymmetric orbifolds supersymmetry prevents this6, but in nonsupersymmetric theories generically there will no longer be a fixed line for finite N .The dilaton potential is then related to the appearance of a nonzero beta function inthe field theory, and the minima of this potential are related to the zeros of the fieldtheory beta function for finite N .As a first example we can analyze the case 330 of D3branes on an R4Zk orbifold singularity, which preserves N  2 supersymmetry. Before taking the nearhorizon limit, the lowenergy field theory at the free orbifold point in the string theory moduli space is a UNk gauge theory with bifundamental hypermultiplets in theN, N, 1,    , 1  1,N, N, 1,    , 1     1,    , 1,N, N  N, 1,    , 1,N representation. The bare gauge couplings i of all the UN theories are equal to the stringcoupling IIB at this point in the moduli space. In the nearhorizon lowenergy limitthis field theory becomes the SUNk field theory with the same matter content, sincethe offdiagonal U1 factors are IRfree7 and the diagonal U1 factor is decoupledhere and in all other examples in this section so we will ignore it. This theory is dualto type IIB string theory on AdS5  S5Zk, where the Zk action leaves fixed an S1inside the S5.This field theory is known see, for instance, 353 to be a finite field theory for anyvalue of the k gauge couplings i, corresponding to a kcomplexdimensional surfaceof conformal field theories. Thus, we should see k complex parameters in the string5There is no similar relation for the twisted sector operators.6At least, it prevents a potential for the dilaton, so there is still some fixed line in the field theory,though it can be shifted from the N  4 fixed line when 1N corrections are taken into account.7This does not contradict our previous statements about the beta functions since the U1 factorsare subleading in the 1N expansion, and the operators corresponding to the offdiagonal U1s comefrom twisted sectors.115theory background which we can change without destroying the AdS5 component ofthis background. One such parameter is obviously the dilaton, and the other k  1may be identified 330 with the values of the NSNS and RR 2form Bfields on thek 1 2cycles which vanish at the Zk orbifold singularity these are part of the blowup modes for the singularities the other blowup modes turn on fields which change theAdS5 background, and correspond to nonmarginal deformations of the field theory.The lowenergy spectrum has contributions both from the untwisted and from thetwisted sectors. The untwisted sector states are just the Zk projection of the originalAdS5  S5 states. The twisted sector states are the same for large N and at lowenergies as those which appear in flat space at an R4Zk singularity, except that herethey live on the fixed locus of the Zk action which is of the form AdS5  S1. At theorbifold point the massless twisted sector states are k  1 tensor multiplets thesetensor multiplets include scalars corresponding to the 2form Bfields described above.Upon dimensional reduction on the S1 these give rise to k  1 U1 gauge fields onAdS5, which correspond to the U1 global symmetries of the field theory which werethe offdiagonal gauge U1s before taking the nearhorizon limit, and become globalsymmetries after this limit see, e.g. 354. The orbifold point corresponds to havingall the Bfields maximally turned on 355. The spectrum of fields on AdS5 in thisbackground was successfully compared 356 to the spectrum of chiral operators in thefield theory. If we move in the string theory moduli space to a point where the Bfields on some 2cycles are turned off, the D3branes wrapped around these 2cyclesbecome tensionless, and the lowenergy theory becomes a nontrivial N  2, 0 sixdimensional SCFT see 93 and references therein. The lowenergy spectrum onAdS5 then includes the dimensional reduction of this conformal theory on a circle. Inparticular, when all theBfields are turned off, we get theAk1 2, 0 theory, which givesrise to SUk gauge fields at lowenergies upon compactification on a circle. Thus, theAdSCFT correspondence predicts an enhanced global SUk symmetry at a particularpoint in the parameter space of the corresponding field theory. Presumably, this pointis in a very strongly coupled regime the string coupling IIB i i may be chosento be weak, but individual is can still be strongly coupled which cannot be accesseddirectly in the field theory. The field theory in this case has a large group of dualitysymmetries 353, which includes but is not limited to the SL2,Z subgroup whichacts on the couplings as   a  bc  d at the point where they are all equal.In the type IIB background the SL2,Z subgroup of this duality group is manifest,but it is not clear how to see the rest of this group.Our second example corresponds to D3branes at an R6Z3 orbifold point, where, ifwe write R6 as C3 with complex coordinates zj j  1, 2, 3, the Z3 acts as zj  e2i3zj .In this case the only fixed point of the Z3 action is the origin, so in the nearhorizonlimit we get 330 AdS5  S5Z3 where the compact space is smooth. Thus, the low116energy spectrum in this case for large gsN includes only the Z3 projection of theoriginal supergravity spectrum, and all twisted sector states are heavy in this limit.The corresponding field theory may be derived by the methods of 344, 345. It isan SUN3 gauge theory, with chiral multiplets Uj j  1, 2, 3 in the N, N, 1 representation, Vj j  1, 2, 3 in the 1,N, N representation, and Wj j  1, 2, 3 in theN, 1,N representation, and a classical superpotential of the form W  gijkUiVjWk.In the classical theory all three gauge couplings and the superpotential coupling g areequal and equal to the string coupling. In the quantum theory one can prove thatin the space of these four parameters there is a one dimensional line of superconformal fixed points. The parameter which parameterizes this fixed line which passesthrough weak coupling in the gauge theory may be identified with the dilaton in theAdS5  S5Z3 background. Unlike the previous case, here there are no indications ofadditional marginal deformations, and no massless twisted sector states on AdS5 whichthey could correspond to.As in the previous case, one can try to compare the spectrum of fields on AdS5with the spectrum of chiral operators in the field theory. In this case, as in all caseswith less than N  4 supersymmetry, not all the supergravity fields on AdS5 are inchiral multiplets, since the N  4 chiral multiplets split into chiral, antichiral andnonchiral multiplets when decomposed into N  2 or N  1 representations8 ingeneral there can also be various sizes of chiral multiplets. However, one can stillcompare those of the fields which are in chiral multiplets and have the appropriaterelations between their AdS mass  field theory dimension and their Rcharges. Theuntwisted states may easily be matched since they are a projection of the originalstates both in spacetime and in the field theory if we think of the field theory as aprojection of the N  4 SU3N gauge theory. Looking at the twisted sectors weseem to encounter a paradox 333. On the string theory side all the twisted sectorstates are heavy they correspond to strings stretched across the S5, so they wouldcorrespond to operators with   mR  R2l2s  gsN12. On the field theory sidewe can identify the twisted sector fields with operators which are charged under theglobal Z3 symmetry which rotates the three gauge groups, and naively there exist chiraloperators which are charged under this symmetry and remain of finite dimension in thelarge N, g2YMN limit. However, a careful analysis shows that all of these operators arein fact descendants, so their dimensions are not protected. For example, the operator3j1 e2ij3TrW j 2, where W j is the field strength multiplet of the jth SUNgroup, seems to be a chiral superfield charged under the Z3 symmetry. However, usinglinear combinations of the Konishi anomaly equations 357, 358 for the three gaugegroups, one can show that this operator and all other twisted sector operators is in8Note that this means that unlike the AdS5  S5 case, in cases with less SUSY there are alwaysnonchiral operators which have a finite dimension in the large N, g2YMN limit.117fact a descendant, so there is no paradox. The AdSCFT correspondence predicts thatin the large N , g2YMN limit the dimension of all these Z3charged operators scales asg2YMN12, which is larger than the scaling   g2YMN14 for the nonchiral operatorsin the N  4 SYM theory in the same limit. It would be interesting to verify thisbehavior in the field theory. Baryonlike operators also exist in these theories 359,which are similar to those which will be discussed in section 4.1.3.There are various other supersymmetric orbifold backgrounds which behave similarly to the examples we have described in detail here. There are also many nonsupersymmetric examples 360, 361 but, as described above, their fate for finite N isnot clear, and we will not discuss them in detail here.4.1.2 Orientifolds of AdS5  S5The discussion of the nearhorizon limits of D3branes on orientifolds is mostly similarto the discussion of orbifolds, except for the absence of twisted sector states which donot exist for orientifolds. We will focus here on two examples which illustrate someof the general properties of these backgrounds. Additional examples were discussed in362, 363, 364, 365, 366, 367, 368, 369.Our first example is the nearhorizon limit of D3branes on an orientifold 3plane.The orientifold breaks the same supersymmetries as the 3branes do, so in the nearhorizon limit we have the full 32 supercharges corresponding to a d  4,N  4 SCFT.In flat space there are see 370 and references therein two types of orientifold planeswhich lead to different projections on Dbrane states. One type of orientifold planeleads to a lowenergy SO2N N  4 gauge theory for N Dbranes on the orientifold,while the other leads to a USp2N N  4 gauge theory. In the first case we can alsohave an additional half D3brane stuck on the orientifold, leading to an SO2N 1N  4 gauge theory. In the nearhorizon limits of branes on the orientifold we shouldbe able to find string theory backgrounds which are dual to all of these gauge theories.The nearhorizon limit of these brane configurations is type IIB string theory onAdS5  S5Z2  AdS5  RP5, where the Z2 acts by identifying opposite points onthe S5, so there are no fixed points and the space RP5 is smooth. The manifestationof the orientifolding in the nearhorizon limit is that when a string goes around anoncontractible cycle in RP5 connecting opposite points of the S5 its orientationis reversed. In all the cases discussed above the string theory perturbation expansionhad only closed orientable surfaces, so it was a power series in g2s or in 1N2 in thet Hooft limit but in this background we can also have nonorientable closed surfaceswhich include crosscaps, and the perturbation expansion includes also odd powers ofgs or of 1N in the t Hooft limit. In fact, it has long been known 37 that in thet Hooft limit the SON and USpN gauge theories give rise to Feynman diagrams118that involve also nonorientable surfaces as opposed to the SUN case which givesonly orientable surfaces, so it is not surprising that such diagrams arise in the stringtheory which is dual to these theories. While in the cases described above the leadingcorrection in string perturbation theory was of order g2s or 1N2 in the t Hooft limit,in the AdS5RP5 background and in general in orientifold backgrounds the leadingcorrection comes fromRP2 worldsheets and is of order gs or 1N in the t Hooft limit.Such a correction appears, for instance, in the computation of the central charge the 2point function of the energymomentum tensor of these theories, which is proportionalto the dimension of the corresponding gauge group.Our discussion so far has not distinguished between the different configurations corresponding to SO2N, SO2N1 and USp2N groups the only obvious parameterin the orientifold background is the 5form flux N. In the Feynman diagram expansionit is wellknown 371, 372 that the SO2N and USp2N theories are related by atransformation taking N to N, which inverts the sign of all diagrams with an oddnumber of crosscaps in the t Hooft limit. Thus, we should look for a similar effect instring theory on AdS5RP5. It turns out 216 that this is implemented by a discretetorsion on RP5, corresponding to turning on a BNSNS 2form in the nontrivial cohomology class of H3RP5, Z  Z2. The effect of turning on this discrete torsion isexactly to invert the sign of all string diagrams with an odd number of crosscaps. It isalso possible to turn on a similar discrete torsion for the RR 2form Bfield, so thereis a total of four different possible string theories on AdS5  RP5. It turns out thatthe theory with no Bfields is equivalent to the SO2N N  4 gauge theory, whichis selfdual under the Sduality group SL2,Z. The theory with only a nonzero BRRfield is equivalent to the SO2N  1 gauge theory, while the theories with nonzeroBNSNS fields are equivalent to the USp2N gauge theory 216, and this is consistentwith the action of Sduality on these groups and on the 2form Bfields which are adoublet of SL2,Z.An interesting test of this correspondence is the matching of chiral primary fields.In the supergravity limit the fields on AdS5  RP5 are just the Z2 projection of thefields on AdS5  S5, including the multiplets with n  2, 4, 6,    in the notation ofsection 3.2. This matches with almost all the chiral superfields in the correspondinggauge theories, which are described as traces of products of the fundamental fields asin section 3.2, but with the trace of a product of an odd number of fields vanishing inthese theories from symmetry arguments. However, in the SO2N gauge theories andnot in any of the others there is an additional gauge invariant chiral superfield, calledthe Pfaffian, whose lowest component is of the form a1a2a2NI1a1a2I2a3a4   INa2N1a2N ,where ai are SO2N indices and the Ij are symmetric traceless indices in the 6 ofSU4R. The supersymmetry algebra guarantees that the dimension of this operatoris   N , and it is independent of the other gaugeinvariant chiral superfields. This119operator may be identified with the field on AdS5 corresponding to a D3brane wrappedaround a 3cycle in RP5, corresponding to the homology class H3RP5,Z  Z2. Thiswrapping is only possible when no Bfields are turned on 216, consistent with suchan operator existing for SO2N but not for SO2N  1 or USp2N. While it isnot known how to compute the mass of this state directly, the superconformal algebraguarantees that it has the right mass to correspond to an operator with   N  thenaive approximation to the mass, since the volume of the 3cycle in RP5 is 2R3, ismR  R  2R323gsl4s  R48l4p  N since in the orientifold case R4  42Nl4pinstead of equation 3.3, which leads to the correct dimension for large N . Theexistence of this operator which decouples in the large N limit is an important testof the finite N correspondence. Anomaly matching in this background was discussedin 233.Another interesting background is the nearhorizon limit of D3branes on an orientifold 7plane, with 4 D7branes coincident on the orientifold plane to ensure 373, 374that the dilaton is constant and the lowenergy theory is conformal this is the sameas D3branes in Ftheory 375 at a D4type singularity. The field theory we get inthe nearhorizon limit in this case is 376, 377 an N  2 SQCD theory with USp2Ngauge group, a hypermultiplet in the antisymmetric representation and four hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation. In this case the orientifold action hasfixed points on the S5, so the nearhorizon limit is 378, 379 type IIB string theoryon AdS5  S5Z2 where the Z2 action has fixed points on an S3 inside the S5. Thus,this background includes an orientifold plane with the topology of S3 AdS5, and theD7branes stretched along the orientifold plane also remain as part of the background,so that the lowenergy theory includes both the supergravity modes in the bulk and theSO8 gauge theory on the D7branes which corresponds to an SO8 global symmetry in the corresponding field theories9. The string perturbation expansion in this casehas two sources of corrections of order gs, the crosscap diagram and the open stringdisc diagram with strings ending on the D7brane, leading to two types of correctionsof order 1N in the t Hooft limit. Again, the spectrum of operators in the field theorymay be matched 379 with the spectrum of fields coming from the dimensional reduction of the supergravity theory in the bulk and of the 7brane theory wrapped on theS3. The anomalies may also be matched to the field theory, including 1N correctionsto the leading large N result 232 which arise from disc and crosscap diagrams.By studying other backgrounds of D3branes with 7branes with or without orientifolds one can obtain nonconformal theories which exhibit a logarithmic runningof the coupling constant 379, 380. For instance, by separating the D7branes awayfrom the orientifold plane, corresponding to giving a mass to the hypermultiplets inthe fundamental representation, one finds string theory solutions in which the dilaton9Similar backgrounds were discussed in 172.120varies in a similar way to the variation of the coupling constant in the field theory,and this behavior persists also in the nearhorizon limit which is quite complicated inthis case, and becomes singular close to the branes, corresponding to the lowenergylimit of the field theories which is in this case a free Abelian Coulomb phase. Thisagreement with the perturbative expectation, even though we are necessarily in aregime of large   g2YMN , is due to special properties of N  2 gauge theories, whichprevent many quantities from being renormalized beyond oneloop.4.1.3 Conifold theoriesIn the correspondence between string theory on AdS5  S5 and d  4 N  4 SYMtheories, some of the most direct checks, such as protected operator dimensions and thefunctional form of two and threepoint functions, are determined by properties of thesupergroup SU2, 24. Many of the normalizations of two and threepoint functionswhich have been computed explicitly are protected by nonrenormalization theorems.And yet, we are inclined to believe that the correspondence is a fundamental dynamical principle, valid independent of group theory and the special nonrenormalizationproperties of N  4 supersymmetry.To test this belief we want to consider theories with reduced supersymmetry. Orbifold theories 330 provide interesting examples however, as discussed in the previoussections, it has been shown 349, 350 that at large N these theories are a projectionof N  4 superYangMills theory in particular many of their Greens functions aredictated by the Greens functions of the N  4 theory. The projection involved isonto states invariant under the group action that defines the orbifold. Intuitively, thissimilarity with the N  4 theory arises because the compact part of the geometry isstill almost everywhere locally S5, just with some global identifications. Therefore,to make a more nontrivial test of models with reduced supersymmetry, we are moreinterested in geometries of the form AdS5M5 where the compact manifold M5 is noteven locally S5.In fact, such compactifications have a long history in the supergravity literature thedirect product geometry AdS5 M5 is known as the FreundRubin ansatz 113. Thecurvature of the antide Sitter part of the geometry is supported by the fiveform oftype IIB supergravity. Because this fiveform is selfdual, M5 must also be an Einsteinmanifold, but with positive cosmological constant rescaling M5 if necessary, we canwrite R  4g. For simplicity, we are assuming that only the fiveform and themetric are involved in the solution.A trivial but useful observation is that fivedimensional Einstein manifolds withR  4g are in onetoone correspondence with Ricciflat manifolds C6 whose metric121has the conical formds2C6  dr2  r2ds2M5 . 4.1It can be shown that, given any metric of the form 4.1, the tendimensional metricds210 1 R4r412 dt2  dx21  dx22  dx231 R4r412ds2C6 4.2is a solution of the type IIB supergravity equations, provided one puts N units offiveform flux through the manifold M5, whereR4 2NVolM5. 4.3Furthermore, it was shown in 172 that the number of supersymmetries preserved bythe geometry 4.2 is half the number that are preserved by its Ricciflat R  0 limit.Preservation of supersymmetry therefore amounts to the existence of a Killing spinoron ds2C6 , which would imply that it is a CalabiYau metric. Finally, the r  R limit of4.2 is precisely AdS5M5, and in that limit the number of preserved supersymmetriesdoubles.These facts suggest a useful means of searching for nontrivial FreundRubin geometries starting with a string vacuum of the form R3,1  C6, where C6 is Ricciflat, welocate a singularity of C6 where the metric locally has the form 4.1, and place a largenumber of D3branes at that point. The resulting nearhorizon FreundRubin geometry has the same number of supersymmetries as the original braneless string geometry.The program of searching for and classifying such singularities on manifolds preservingsome supersymmetry was enunciated most completely in 333.We will focus our attention on the simplest nontrivial example, which was workedout in 21710. C6 is taken to be the standard conifold, which as a complex 3fold isdetermined by the equationz21  z22  z23  z24  0 . 4.4The CalabiYau metric on this manifold has SU3 holonomy, so one quarter of supersymmetry is preserved. We will always count our supersymmetries in fourdimensionalsuperconformal field theory terms, so one quarter of maximal supersymmetry that is,eight real supercharges is in our terminology N  1 supersymmetry superconformalsymmetry. The supergravity literature often refers to this amount of supersymmetryin five dimensions as N  2, because in a flat space supergravity theory with this10Additional aspects and examples of conifold theories were discussed in 381, 382, 383, 384, 385,386.122much supersymmetry, reduction on S1 without breaking any supersymmetry leads toa supergravity theory in four dimensions with N  2 supersymmetry.The CalabiYau metric on the manifold 4.4 may be derived from the Kahler potential K 4i1 zi223, and can be explicitly written asds2C6  dr2  r2ds2T 11 , 4.5where ds2T 11 is the Einstein metric on the coset spaceT 11 SU2 SU2U1. 4.6In the quotient 4.6, the U1 generator is chosen to be the sum 123123 of generatorsof the two SU2s. The manifolds T pq, where the U1 generator is chosen to bep23q23, with p and q relatively prime, were studied in 174. The topology of each ofthese manifolds is S2 S3. They all admit unique Einstein metrics. Only T 11 leads toa sixmanifold C6 which admits Killing spinors. In fact, besides S5  SO6SO5,T 11 is the unique fivedimensional coset space which preserves supersymmetry. TheEinstein metrics can be obtained via a rescaling of the Killing metric on SU2SU2by a process explained in 174. The metric on T 11 satisfying R  4g can be writtenasds2T 11 162i1d2i  sin2 id2i 19d  cos 1d1  cos 2d22 . 4.7The volume of this metric is 16327, whereas the volume of the unit fivesphere, whichalso has R  4g, is 3.Perhaps the most intuitive way to motivate the conjectured dual gauge theory 217is to first consider the S5Z2 orbifold gauge theory, where the Z2 is chosen to flip thesigns of four of the six real coordinates in R6, and thus has a fixed S1 on the unit S5in this flat space. This Z2 breaks SO6 down to SO4  SO2, which is the sameisometry group as for T 11. In fact, it can also be shown that an appropriate blowup ofthe singularities along the fixed S1 leads to a manifold of topology S2  S3. Since T 11is a smooth deformation of the blownup orbifold, one might suspect that its dual fieldtheory is some deformation of the orbifolds dual field theory. The latter field theoryis well known 330, as described in section 4.1.1. It has N  2 supersymmetry. Thefield content in N  1 language isgauge group SUN SUNchirals A1, A2chirals B1, B2chiral  adj 1chiral  1 adj.4.8123The adjoint chiral fields  and , together with the N  1 gauge multiplets, fill outN  2 gauge multiplets. The chiral multiplets A1, B1 combine to form an N  2hypermultiplet, and so do A2, B2. The superpotential is dictated by N  2 supersymmetryW  gTrA1B1  A2B2  gTrB1A1 B2A2 , 4.9where g is the gauge coupling of both SUN gauge groups. A relevant deformationwhich preserves the global SU2  SU2  U1 symmetry, and also N  1 supersymmetry, isW W  12mTr2  Tr2. 4.10There is a nontrivial renormalization group flow induced by these mass terms. Theexistence of a nontrivial infrared fixed point can be demonstrated using the methodsof 387 having integrated out the heavy fields  and , the superpotential is quarticin the remaining fields, which should, therefore, all have dimension 34 at the infraredfixed point assuming that we do not break the symmetry between the two gaugegroups. The anomalous dimension   12 for the quadratic operators TrAB isprecisely what is needed to make the exact beta functions vanish.The IR fixed point of the renormalization group described in the previous paragraphis the candidate for the field theory dual to type IIB string theory on AdS5T 11, or inweak coupling terms the lowenergy field theory of coincident D3branes on a conifoldsingularity. There are several nontrivial checks that this is the right theory. Thesimplest is to note that the moduli space of the N  1 version of the theory is simplythe conifold. For N  1 the scalar fields ai and bj in the chiral multiplets Ai and Bjare just complexvalued. The moduli space can be parametrized by the combinationsaibj , and if we writez1  iz4 iz2  z3iz2  z3 z1  iz4a1b1 a1b2a2b1 a2b2, 4.11then we recover the conifold equation 4.4 by taking the determinant of both sides.In the N  1 theories, a slight generalization of this line of argument leads to theconclusion that the fully Higgsed phase of the theory, where all the D3branes areseparated from one another, has for its moduli space the N th symmetric power of theconifold.The most notable prediction of the renormalization group analysis of the gaugetheory is that the operators TrAiBj should have dimension 32. This is something weshould be able to see from the dual description. As a warmup, consider first the N  4example. There, as described in section 3.2, the lowest dimension operators have theform TrIJ, and their dimension is two. Their description in supergravity is a Weyldeformation of the S5 part of the geometry with haa  Y 2y, where haa is the traceof the metric on S5 and Y 2y is a dwave spherical harmonic on S5. The fourform124potential Dabcd is also involved in the deformation, and there are two mass eigenstatesin AdS5 which are combinations of these two fields. A simple way to compute Y2 is tostart with the function xixj on R6 and restrict it to the unit S5. This suggests quitea general way to find eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on an Einstein manifold M5 westart by looking for harmonic functions on the associated conical geometry 4.1. TheLaplacian isC6 1r5rr5r 1r2M5 . 4.12The operator r2 C6 commutes with rr, so we can restrict our search to functions fon C6 with C6 f  0 and rrf  f for some constant . Such harmonic functionsrestricted to r  1 have M5 fr1   4fr1. Following through the analysisof 126 one learns that the mass of the lighter of the two scalars in AdS5 correspondingto haa  fr1is m2R2   4. So, the dimension of the corresponding operator is. In view of 4.11, all we need to do to verify in the supergravity approximation therenormalization group prediction   32 for TrAiBj is to show that rrzi 32zi. Thisfollows from scaling considerations as follows. The dilation symmetry on the cone isr  r. Under this dilation, ds2C6  2ds2C6 . The Kahler form should have this samescaling, and that will follow if also the Kahler potential K  2K. As mentionedabove, the CalabiYau metric follows from K 4i1 zi223, which has the desiredscaling if zi  32zi. Thus, indeed rrzi  32zi.It is straightforward to generalize the above line of argument to operators of theform TrAi1Bj1 . . . AiBj. Various aspects of the matching of operators in the conformal field theory to KaluzaKlein modes in supergravity have been studied in 217,173, 388. But there is another interesting type of color singlet operators, which arecalled dibaryons because the color indices of each gauge group are combined using anantisymmetric tensor. The dibaryon operator is1...N 1...NA11 . . . ANN , 4.13where we have suppressed SU2 indices. Let us use the notation SU2A for the globalsymmetry group under which Ai form a doublet, and SU2B for the group under whichBj form a doublet. Clearly, 4.13 is a singlet under SU2B. This provides the clueto its string theory dual, which must also be SU2Bsymmetric it is a D3branewrapped on T 11 along an orbit of SU2B 218. Using the explicit metric 4.7, itis straightforward to verify that mR  34N in the test brane approximation. Up tocorrections of order 1N , the massdimension relation is   mR, so we see thatagain the field theory prediction for the anomalous dimension of A is born out. The 3cycle which the D3brane is wrapped on may be shown to be the unique homologicallynontrivial 3cycle of T 11. There is also an antidibaryon, schematically BN , whichis a D3brane wrapped on an orbit of SU2A. The two wrappings are opposite in125homology, so the dibaryon and antidibaryon can annihilate to produce mesons. Thisinteresting process has never been studied in any detail, no doubt because the dynamicsis complicated and nonsupersymmetric. It is possible to construct dibaryon operatorsalso in a variety of orbifold theories 218, 359.The gauge theory dual to T 11 descends via renormalization group flow from thegauge theory dual to S5Z2, as described after 4.10. The conformal anomaly hasbeen studied extensively for such flows see for example 225, and the coefficient a in3.31 is smaller in the IR than in the UV for every known flow that connects UV andIR fixed points. Cardy has conjectured that this must always be the case 389. Todescribe the field theoretic attempts to prove such a ctheorem would take us too farafield, so instead we refer the reader to 390 and references therein. In section 4.3.2we will demonstrate that a limited ctheorem follows from elementary properties ofgravity if the AdSCFT correspondence is assumed.In the presence of N  1 superconformal invariance, one can compute the anomalycoefficients a and c in 3.31 if one knows Rg ,B , where R is the Rcurrentwhich participates in the superconformal algebra, and the expectation value is takenin the presence of an arbitrary metric g and an external gauge field source B forthe Rcurrent. The reason a and c can be extracted from this anomalous onepointfunction is that R and T  are superpartners in the N  1 multiplet of anomalies.It was shown in 225 via a supergroup argument thatRTT  a c RRR  5a 3c  ,4.14where now the correlators are computed in flat space. The omitted expressions betweenthe square brackets are tensors depending on the positions or momenta of the operatorsin the correlator. Their form is not of interest to us here because it is the same for anytheory we are interested instead in the coefficients. These can be computed perturbatively via the triangle diagrams in figure 4.1. The AdlerBardeen theorem guaranteesthat the one loop result is exact, provided R is nonanomalous in the absence ofexternal sources that is, it suffers from no internal anomalies. The constants of proportionality in the relations shown in figure 4.1 can be tracked down by comparing thecomplete Feynman diagram amplitude with the explicit tensor forms which we haveomitted from 4.14. We are mainly interested in ratios of central charges between IRand UV fixed points, so we do not need to go through this exercise.The field theory dual to S5Z2, expressed in N  1 language, has the field content described in 4.8. The Rcurrent of the chosen N  1 superconformal algebradescends from a U1 in the SO6 Rsymmetry group of the N  4 algebra, and itassigns a U1R charge r  1 to the 2N2 gauginos fermionic components of thevector superfield and r  13 to the 6N2 quarks fermionic components of the126TTR RRRa ba c r 5a 3c r3Figure 4.1 Triangle diagrams for computing the anomalous contribution to R. Thesum is over the chiral fermions  which run around the loop, and r is the Rchargeof each such fermion.chiral superfields11. We have r  0, which means that the Rcurrent has nogravitational anomalies 391.For the field theory dual to T 11, the Rcurrent described in the previous paragraph isno longer nonanomalous because we have added a mass to the adjoint chiral superfields.There is, however, a nonanomalous combination S of this current, R, with theKonishi currents, Ki, which by definition assign charge 1 to the fermionic fields in theith chiral multiplet and charge 0 to the fermionic fields in the vector multipletsS  R 23iiIR  iKi . 4.15Here i is the anomalous dimension of the ith chiral superfield. At the strongly interacting N  1 infrared fixed point, S is the current which participates in thesuperconformal algebra. However, to compute correlators S . . . it is more convenient to go to the ultraviolet, where i  0 and the perturbative analysis in termsof fermions running around a loop can be applied straightforwardly. Using the factthat AIR  BIR  14 and IR  IR  12, we find that sUV  1 for the gauginos, sUV  12 for the quarks which stay light i.e., the bifundamental quarks,and sUV  0 for the quarks which are made heavy that is, the adjoint quarks.Note that it is immaterial whether we include these heavy quarks in the triangle diagram, which is as it should be since we can integrate them out explicitly. As before,11We will ignore here the distinction between UN and SUN groups which is subleading in the1N expansion.127 sUV  0, so there are no gravitational anomalies and aIR  cIR. Combining theinformation in the past two paragraphs, we have a field theory prediction for the flowfrom the S5Z2 theory to the T11 theoryaIRaUVcIRcUV5aIR  3cIR5aUV  3cUV2N2  4N21232N2  6N2133 2732. 4.16This analysis was carried out in 173, where it was also noted that these numberscan be computed in the supergravity approximation. To proceed, let us write thetendimensional Einstein metric asds210  R2ds25 R2ds2M5, 4.17where R is given by 4.3 and ds25 is the metric of AdS5 scaled so that R  4g .We will refer to ds25 as the dimensionless AdS5 metric. Reducing the action from tendimensions to five results inS 3R822d5xgR 12  . . .2N28VolM5d5xgR 12  . . ., 4.18whereg and R under the integral sign refer to the dimensionless AdS5 metric, andin the second equality we have used 4.3. In 4.18,  is the tendimensional gravitational coupling. In computing Greens functions using the prescription of 19, 20,the prefactor 2N28VolM5multiplies every Greens function. In particular, it becomes thenormalization factor for the onepoint function T   as calculated in 226. Also, aspointed out in section 3.2, the supergravity calculation in 226 always leads to a  c.Without further thought we can write a  c  VolM51, andaIRaUVcIRcUVVolT 11VolS5Z212732, 4.19in agreement with 4.16. It is essential that the volumes in 4.19 be computed formanifolds with the same cosmological constant. Our convention has been to haveR  4g.It is possible to do better and pin down the exact normalization of the centralcharges. In fact, literally the first normalization check performed in the AdSCFTcorrespondence was the verification 19 that in the compactification dual to N  4SUN YangMills theory, the coefficient c had the value N24 to leading order inlarge N. Thus, in generala  c 3N24VolM54.20128again to leading order in large N for the CFT dual to a FreundRubin geometryAdS5  M5 supported by N units of fiveform flux through the M5. This is in anormalization convention where the CFT comprised of a single free real scalar fieldhas c  1120. See, for example, 173 for a table of standard anomaly coefficients perdegree of freedom. Even more generally, we can consider any compactification of stringtheory or Mtheory or any other, asyetunknown theory of quantum gravity whosenoncompact portion is AdS5. This would include in particular type IIB supergravitygeometries which involve the BNS,RR fields, or the complex coupling  . Say the AdS5geometry has R  g . If we rescale the metric by a factor of 4, we obtain thedimensionless AdS5 metric ds25 with R  4g . In defining a conformal field theorythrough its duality to the AdS5 compactification under consideration, the part of theaction relevant to the computation of central charges is still the EinsteinHilbert termplus the cosmological termS 1225d5xg R 3  . . .  42532d5xgR 12  . . ., 4.21where 25  8G5 is the fivedimensional gravitational coupling. Comparing straightforwardly with the special case analyzed in 4.20, we find that the conformal anomalycoefficients, as always to leading order in 1N , must be given bya  c 1G532. 4.224.2 DBranes in AdS, Baryons and InstantonsA conservative form of the AdSCFT correspondence would be to say that classicalsupergravity captures the large N asymptotics of some quantities in field theory whichare algebraically protected against dependence on the t Hooft coupling. The strongerform which is usually advocated, and which we believe is true, is that the field theoryis literally equivalent to the string theory, and the only issue is understanding themapping from one to the other. To put this belief to the test, it is natural to askwhat in field theory corresponds to nonperturbative objects, such as Dbranes, instring theory. The answer was found in 216 for several types of wrapped branessee also 293 for an independent analysis of some cases, and subsequent papers392, 393, 394, 184, 395, 396, 333, 397, 359, 398, 399 have extended and elaboratedon the story. See also 400, 401 for actions for Dbranes in antide Sitter space, and402, 403 for other related topics. The connection between Dinstantons and gaugetheory instantons has also been extensively studied, and we summarize the results atthe end of this section.129Let us start with wrapped branes which have no spatial extent in AdS5 they areparticles propagating in this space. The field theory interpretation must be in termsof some vertex or operator, as for any other particle in AdS as described above in thecase of supergravity particles. If the compact manifold is S5, then the only topologically stable possibility is a wrapped 5brane. The key observation here is that chargeconservation requires that N strings must run into or out of the 5brane. In the case ofa D5brane, these N strings are fundamental strings one could also consider SL2,Zimages of this configuration. The argument is a slight variant of the ones used in thediscussion of anomalous brane creation 404, 405, 406. There are N units of fiveformF5 flux on the S5, and the coupling 12aF5 in the D5brane worldvolume translatesthis flux into N units of charge under the U1 gauge field a on the D5brane. Sincethe D5brane spatial worldvolume is closed, the total charge must be zero. A stringrunning out of the D5brane counts as 1 unit of U1 charge, hence the conclusion.Reversing the orientation of the D5brane changes the sign of the charge induced byF5, and correspondingly the N strings should run into the brane rather than out.In the absence of other Dbranes, the strings cannot end anywhere in AdS5, so theymust run out to the boundary. A string ending on the boundary is interpreted see section 3.5 as an electric charge in the fundamental representation of the SUN gaugegroup an external nondynamical quark. This interpretation comes from viewingthe strings as running from the D5brane to a D3brane at infinity. It was shown in405 that such stretched strings have a unique ground state which is fermionic, andthe conclusion is that the D5brane baryon is precisely an antisymmetric combination of N fermionic fundamental string quarks. The gauge theory interpretation isclear because the gauge group is SUN rather than UN, there is a gaugeinvariantbaryonic vertex for N external fundamental quarks. We will return to a discussion ofbaryonic objects in section 6.2.2.To obtain other types of wrapped brane objects with no spatial extent in AdS5, wemust turn to compact manifolds with more nontrivial homology cycles. Apart from theintrinsic interest of studying such objects and the gauge theories in which they occur,the idea is to verify the claim that every object we can exhibit in gauge theory has astringy counterpart, and vice versa.Following 216 and the discussion in section 4.1.2, we now examine wrapped branesin the AdS5 RP5 geometry, which is the nearhorizon geometry of D3branes placedon top of a Z2 orientifold threeplane the Z2 acts as xi  xi for the six coordinatesperpendicular to the D3branes. H3RP5,Z  Z2, and the generator of the homologygroup is a projective space RP3  RP5. This seems to offer the possibility of wrappinga D3brane on a 3cycle to get a particle in AdS5. However, there is a caveat as arguedin 216 the wrapping is permitted only if there is no discrete torsion for the NS andRR Bfields. In gauge theory terms, that amounts to saying that the corresponding130operator is permitted if and only if the gauge group is SON with N even. Directcalculation leads to a mass m  NR for the wrapped brane, so the correspondinggauge theory operator has dimension N at least to leading order in large N. Abeautiful fact is that a candidate gauge theory operator exists precisely when thegauge group is SON with N even it is the Pfaffian operator,1N2a1a2...aNa1a2 . . . aN1aN . 4.23Here the fields ab are the adjoint scalar bosons which are the N  4 superpartnersof the gauge bosons. We have suppressed their global flavor index. A similar wrapped3brane was discussed in section 4.1.3, where the 3brane was wrapped around the3cycle of T 11 which is topologically S2  S3.It is also interesting to consider branes with spatial extent in AdS5. Strings in AdS5were discussed in section 3.5. A threebrane in AdS5 by which we mean any wrappedbrane with three dimensions of spatial extent in AdS5 aligned with one directionperpendicular to the boundary must correspond to some sort of domain wall in thefield theory. Some examples are obvious in AdS5  S5, if the threebrane is a D3brane, then crossing the domain wall shifts the 5form flux and changes the gauge groupfrom SUN to SUN  1 or SUN  1. A less obvious example was considered in216 crossing a D5brane or NS5brane wrapped on some RP2  RP5 changes thediscrete torsion of the RR or NS Bfield, and so one can switch between SON andSpN2 gauge groups. D5branes on homology 2cycles of the base of conifolds andorbifolds have also been studied 218, 383, 359, 407, and the conclusion is that theycorrespond to domain walls across which the rank of some factor in the product gaugegroup is incremented.Another brane wrapping possibility is branes with two dimensions of spatial extentin AdS5. These become strings in the gauge theory when they are oriented with onedimension along the radial direction. In a particular model an SUN3 gauge theorywhose string theory image is AdS5S5Z3 the authors of 359 elucidated their meaning they are strings which give rise to a monodromy for the wavefunctions of particlestransported around them. The monodromy belongs to a discrete symmetry group ofthe gauge theory. The familiar example of such a phenomenon is the AharonovBohmeffect, where the electrons wavefunction picks up a U1 phase when it is transportedaround a tube of magnetic flux. The analysis of 359 extends beyond their specificmodel, and applies in particular to strings in SON gauge theories, with N even,obtained from wrapping a D3brane on a generator of H1RP5,Z, where the RP5 hasno discrete torsion.Finally, we turn to one of the most familiar examples of a nonperturbative objectin gauge theory the instanton. The obvious candidate in string theory to describe aninstanton is the Dinstanton, also known as the D1brane. The correspondence in131this case has been treated extensively in the literature 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413,414, 415. The presentation in 415 is particularly comprehensive, and the reader whois interested in a more thorough review of the subject can find it there. Note that theanalysis of instantons in large N gauge theories is problematic since their contributionis at least naively highly suppressed the k instanton contribution comes with a factorof e82kg2YM  e82kN which goes like eN in the t Hooft limit. Therefore, we canonly discuss instanton contributions to quantities that get no other contributions toany order in the 1N expansion. Luckily, such quantities exist in the N  4 SYMtheory, like the one discussed below.The Einstein metric on AdS5  S5 is unaffected by the presence of a Dinstanton.The massless fields in five dimensions which acquire VEVs in the presence of a Dinstanton are the axion and the dilaton in a coordinate system for the Poincare patchof AdS5 whereds2 R2z2dx2  dz2, 4.24we have 409, 410, 411, 413, asymptotically as z  0,e  gs 24N2z4z4z2  x  x24 . . . ,    e  1gs ,4.25for a Dinstanton whose location in antide Sitter space is x, z. It can be shown usingthe general prescription for computing correlation functions that this corresponds inthe gauge theory to a VEVTrF 2x  192 z4z2  x  x24, 4.26which is exactly right for the selfdual background which describes the instanton ingauge theory. The action of a Dinstanton, 2gs, also matches the action of theinstanton, 82g2YM , because of the relation g2YM  4gs. The result 4.26 is insensitiveto whether the Dinstanton is localized on the S5, since the field under considerationis an SO6 singlet. It is a satisfying verification of the interpretation of the variablez as inverse energy scale that the position z of the Dinstanton translates into the sizeof the gauge theory instanton. In other words, we understand the AdS5 factor whichappears in the moduli space of an SU2 instanton as merely specifying the positionof the Dinstanton in the fivedimensional bulk theory.In fact, at large N , a YangMills instanton is parametrized not only by a point inAdS5, but also by a point in S5. The S5 emerges from keeping track of the fermionicinstanton zero modes properly 415. The approach is to form a bilinear AB in the zeromodes. AB is antisymmetric in the fourvalued SU4 indices A and B, and satisfies132a hermiticity condition that makes it transform in the real 6 of SO6. Dual variablesAB can be introduced into the path integral which have the same antisymmetry andhermiticity properties the possible values of AB correspond to points in R6. When thefermions are integrated out, the resulting determinant acts as a potential for the ABfields, with a minimum corresponding to an S5 whose radius goes into the determinationof the overall normalization of correlation functions.Building on the work of 408 on  corrections to the fourpoint function of stresstensors, the authors of 411 have computed contributions to correlators coming frominstanton sectors of the gauge theory and successfully matched them with Dinstantoncalculations in string theory. It is not entirely clear why the agreement is so good,since the gauge theory computations rely on small t Hooft coupling while the stringtheory computations are for fixed g2YM in the large N limit and nonrenormalizationtheorems are not known for the relevant correlators. The simplest example turns outto be the sixteenpoint function of superconformal currents A  TrFA,where F is the selfdual part of the fieldstrength, A is an index in the fundamentalof SU4,  and  are Lorentz spinor indices, and  and  are the usual Lorentz vectorindices. One needs sixteen insertions of  to obtain a nonzero result from the sixteenGrassmannian integrations over the fermionic zero modes of an instanton. The gaugetheory result for gauge group SU2 turns out to be16p1g2YM App xp21131610g8YMe 82g2Y MiY Md4x dzz5d8 d816p1z4z2  xp  x241zzApp  xp  xpp pAp.4.27The superconformal currents A are dual to spin 12 particles in the bulk dilatinosin ten dimensions which we denote . One of the superpartners of the wellknownR4 term in the superstring action see for example 416 is the sixteenfermion vertex417 in string frame,L  e24R . . .e2f16, 16  c.c . . . , 4.28where f16,  is a modular form with weight 12,12, and  is the complex couplingof type IIB theory   ie YM24ig2YM. 4.29There is a welldefined expansion of this modular form in powers of e2i , e2i , andg2YM . Picking out the oneinstanton contribution and applying the prescription forcalculating Greens functions laid out in section 3.3, one recovers the form 4.27 up133to an overall factor. The overall factor can only be tracked down by redoing the gaugetheory calculation with gauge group SUN, with proper attention paid to the saddlepoint integration over fermionic zero modes, as alluded to in the previous paragraph.The computation of Greens functions such as 4.27 has been extended in 415 to thecase of multiple instantons. Here one starts with a puzzle. The Dinstantons effectivelyform a bound state because integrations over their relative positions converge. Thusthe string theory result has the same form as 4.27, with only a single integrationover a point x, z in AdS5. In view of the emergence of an S5 from the fermioniczero modes at large N , the expectation on the gauge theory side is that the modulispace for k instantons should be k copies of AdS5  S5. But through an analysis ofsmall fluctuations around saddle points of the path integral it was shown that most ofthe moduli are lifted quantum mechanically, and what is left is indeed a single copyof AdS5  S5 as the moduli space, with a prefactor on the saddle point integrationcorresponding to the partition function of the zerodimensional SUk gauge theorywhich lives on k coincident Dinstantons. It is assumed that k  N . Although thek instantons clump in moduli space, their field configurations involve k commutingSU2 subgroups of the SUN gauge group. The correlation functions computed ingauge theory have essentially the same form as 4.27. In comparing with the stringtheory analysis, one picks out the kinstanton contribution in the Taylor expansionof the modular form in 4.28. There is perfect agreement at large N for every finitek, which presumably means that there is some unknown nonrenormalization theoremprotecting these terms.4.3 Deformations of the Conformal Field TheoryIn this section we discuss deformations of the conformal field theory, and what theycorrespond to in its dual description involving string theory on AdS space. We willfocus on the case of the N  4 field theory, though the general ideas hold also forall other examples of the AdSCFT correspondence. We start in section 4.3.1 with ageneral discussion of deformations in field theory and in the dual description. Thenin section 4.3.2 we use the AdSCFT correspondence to prove a restricted ctheorem.In section 4.3.3 we discuss the interesting relevant and marginal deformations of theN  4 SYM field theory and in section 4.3.4 we review what is known about thesedeformations from the point of view of type IIB string theory on AdS5  S5. Theresults we present will be based on 418, 148, 147, 149, 419, 145.1344.3.1 Deformations in the AdSCFT CorrespondenceConformal field theories have many applications in their own right, but since our maininterest at least in the context of four dimensional field theories is in studying nonconformal field theories like QCD, it is interesting to ask how we can learn about nonconformal field theories from conformal field theories. One way to break conformalinvariance, described in section 3.6, is to examine the theory at finite temperature.However, it is also possible to break conformal invariance while preserving Lorentzinvariance, by deforming the action by local operators,S  S  hd4xOx, 4.30for some Lorentz scalar operator O and some coefficient h.The analysis of such a deformation depends on the scaling dimension  of the operator O 12. If   4, the effect of the deformation is strong in the IR and weak inthe UV, and the deformation is called relevant. If   4, the deformation is calledirrelevant, and its effect becomes stronger as the energy increases. Since we generallydescribe field theories by starting with some UV fixed point and flowing to the IR, itdoes not really make sense to start with a CFT and perform an irrelevant deformation,since this would really require a new UV description of the theory. Thus, we will notdiscuss irrelevant deformations here. The last case is   4, which is called a marginaldeformation, and which does not break conformal invariance to leading order in thedeformation. Generally, even if the dimension of an operator equals 4 in some CFT,this will no longer be true after deforming by the operator, and conformal invariancewill be broken. Such deformations can be either marginally relevant or marginally irrelevant, depending on the dimension of the operator O for finite small values of h. Inspecial cases the dimension of the operator will remain   4 for any value of h, andconformal invariance will be present for any value of h. In such a case the deformationis called exactly marginal, and the conformal field theories for all values of h are calleda fixed line generalizing the concept of a conformal field theory as a fixed point of therenormalization group flow. When a deformation is relevant conformal invariance willbe broken, and there are various possibilities for the IR behavior of the field theory. Itcan either flow to some new conformal field theory, which can be free or interacting, orit can flow to a trivial field theory this happens when the theory confines and thereare no degrees of freedom below some energy scale . We will encounter examples ofall of these possibilities in section 4.3.3.The analysis of deformations in the dual string theory on AdS space follows fromour description of the matching of the partition functions in sections 3.1 and 3.3.12If the operator does not have a fixed scaling dimension we can write it as a sum of operators whichare eigenfunctions of the scaling operator, and treat the deformation as a sum of the appropriatedeformations.135The field theory with the deformation 4.30 is described by examining string theorybackgrounds in which the field  on AdS space, which corresponds to the operator O,behaves near the boundary of AdS space like x, UU hU4, where O   andwe use the coordinate system 2.27 with U instead of u. In principle, we should sumover all backgrounds with this boundary condition. Note that, as mentioned in section3.3, in Minkowski space this involves turning on the nonnormalizable solution to thefield equations for x, U turning on the normalizable mode as done for instance in420, 421, 422, 423, 424, 425, 426 cannot be understood as a deformation of the fieldtheory, but instead corresponds to a different state in the same field theory 42713.As in the field theory, we see a big difference between the cases of   4 and   4.When   4, the deformation grows as we approach the boundary, so the solution nearthe boundary will no longer look like AdS space this is analogous to the fact that weneed a new UV description of the field theory in this case. On the other hand, when  4, the solution goes to zero at the boundary, so asymptotically the solution justgoes over to the AdS solution, and the only changes will be in the interior. For   4the solution naively goes to a constant at the boundary, but one needs to analyze thebehavior of the string theory solutions beyond the leading order in the deformationto see if the exact solution actually grows as we approach the boundary a marginallyirrelevant deformation, decreases there a marginally relevant deformation or goes toa constant an exactly marginal deformation.An exactly marginal deformation will correspond to a space of solutions of stringtheory, whose metric will always include an AdS5 factor14, but the other fields canvary as a function of the deformation parameters. A relevant or marginally relevantdeformation will change the behavior in the interior, and the metric will no longer bethat of AdS space. If we start in the regime of large gsN where there is a supergravity approximation to the space, the deformation may be describable in supergravityterms, or it may lead to large fields and curvatures in the interior which will cause thesupergravity approximation to break down. The IR behavior of the corresponding fieldtheory will be reflected in the behavior of the string theory solution for small valuesof U away from the boundary. If the solution asymptotes to an AdS solution also atsmall U , the field theory will flow in the IR to a nontrivial fixed point15. Note thatthe variables describing this AdS space may be different from the variables describingthe original UV AdS space, for instance the form of the SO4, 2 isometries may be13Some of the solutions considered in 423 may correspond to actual deformations of the field theory.14The full space does not necessarily have to be a direct product AdS5  X , but could also be afibration of AdS5 over X , which also has the SO4, 2 isometry group.15Four dimensional field theories are believed 389 to have a ctheorem analogous to the 2dimensional ctheorem 77 which states that the central charge of the IR fixed point will be smallerthan that of the UV fixed point. We will discuss some evidence for this in the AdS context, based onthe analysis of the lowenergy gravity theory, in the next subsection.136different 147. If the solution is described in terms of a space which has a nonzerominimal value of U similar to the space which appears in the AdSSchwarzschild blackhole solution described in section 3.6, but in this case with the full ISO3, 1 isometry group unbroken the field theory will confine and be trivial in the IR. In othercases the geometrical description of the space could break down for small values of U presumably this is what happens when the field theory flows to a free theory in the IR.4.3.2 A ctheoremWithout a detailed analysis of matter fields involved in nonantide Sitter geometries,there are few generalities one can make about the description of renormalization groupflows in the AdSCFT correspondence16. However, there is one general result in gravity145 see also 148 which translates into a ctheorem via the correspondence. Let usconsider Ddimensional metrics of the formds2  e2Ardt2  dx2  dr2 . 4.31Any metric with Poincare invariance in the t, x directions can be brought into this formby an appropriate choice of the radial variable r. Straightforward calculations yieldD  2A  Rtt  Rrr  Gtt Grr  2DT tt  T rr   0 . 4.32In the second to last step we have used Einsteins equation, and in the last step wehave assumed that the weak energy condition holds in the formT  0 4.33for any null vector . This form of the weak energy condition is also known as thenull energy condition, and it is obeyed by all fields which arise in KaluzaKlein compactifications of supergravity theories to D dimensions. Thus, we can take it as a fairlygeneral fact that A  0 for D  2. Furthermore, the inequality is saturated preciselyfor antide Sitter space, where the only contribution to T is from the cosmologicalconstant. Thus in particular, any deformation of AdSD arising from turning on scalarfields will cause A to be concave as a function of r. If we are interested in relevantdeformations of the conformal field theory, then we should recover linear behavior in Anear the boundary, which corresponds to the conformal ultraviolet limit in the fieldtheory. Without loss of generality, then, we assume Ar  r as r  .The inequality A  0 implies that the functionCr  1AD24.3416See 428, 429, 430, 431, 432 for general discussions of the renormalization group flow in the contextof the AdSCFT correspondence.137decreases monotonically as r decreases. Now, suppose there is a region where A is nearlylinear over a range of r corresponding to many orders of magnitude of eAr. This isthe bulk analog of a scaling region in the boundary field theory. The asymptoticallylinear behavior of Ar as r   indicates an ultraviolet scaling region which extendsarbitrarily high in energy. If Ar recovers linear behavior as r  , there is aninfrared scaling region and there could also be large though finite scaling regions inbetween. Assuming odd bulk dimension D, the perfect AdSD spacetime which anysuch scaling region approximates leads to an anomalous VEVT   universalAD2, 4.35where the numerator is a combination of curvature invariants which can be read offfrom the analysis of 226 see section 3.2.2. The point is that in limits where conformalinvariance is recovered, the expression 4.34 coincides with the anomaly coefficients ofthe boundary field theory, up to factors of order unity which are universal for all CFTsin a given dimension. Thus, Cr is a cfunction, and the innocuous inequality A  0amounts to a ctheorem provided that Einstein gravity is a reliable approximation tothe bulk physics.In geometries such as the interpolating kinks of 148, 147, 145 discussed in moredetail in section 4.3.4, the outer antide Sitter region is distinguishable from the innerone in that it has a boundary. There can only be one boundary in Einstein framebecause A gets large and positive only once. In fact, the inner antide Sitter region hasfinite proper volume if the coordinates t and x in 4.31 are made periodic. Supergravityis capable of describing irreversible renormalization group flows despite the reversibilityof the equations, simply because the basic prescription for associating the partitionfunctions of string theory and field theory makes use of the unique boundary.4.3.3 Deformations of the N  4 SUN SYM TheoryThe most natural deformations to examine from the field theory point of view are massdeformations, that would give a mass to the scalar andor fermion fields in the N  4vector multiplet. One is tempted to give a mass to all the scalars and fermions in thetheory, in order to get a theory that will flow to the pure YangMills YM theoryin the IR. Such a deformation would involve operators of the form TrII for thescalar masses, and TrAB c.c. for the fermion masses. In the weak couplingregime of small   g2YMN , such deformations indeed make sense and would lead toa pure YangMills theory in the IR. However, the analysis of this region requires anunderstanding of the string theory in the highcurvature region which corresponds tosmall , which is not yet available. With our present knowledge of string theory weare limited to analyzing the strong coupling regime of large , where supergravity is138a good approximation to the full string theory. In this regime there are two problemswith the mass deformation described above  The operator TrII is a nonchiral operator, so the analysis of section 3.2.1suggests that for large  it acquires a dimension which is at least as large as14, and in particular for large enough values of  it is an irrelevant operator.Thus, we cannot deform the theory by this operator for large . In any casethis operator is not dual to a supergravity field, so analyzing the correspondingdeformation requires going beyond the supergravity approximation. The pure YM theory is a confining theory which dynamically generates a massscale YM , which is the characteristic mass scale for the particles glueballs ofthe theory. When we deform the N  4 theory by a mass deformation witha mass scale m, a oneloop analysis suggests that the mass scale YM will begiven by YM  mecg2YM mN , where c is a constant which does not depend onN arising from the oneloop analysis and g2YMm is the coupling constant atthe scale m. Thus, we find that while for small  we have YM  m and thereis a separation of scales between the dynamics of the massive modes and thedynamics of the YM theory we want to study, for large  we have YM  m andthere is no such separation of scales for nonsupersymmetric mass deformationsthe oneloop analysis we made is not exact, but an exact analysis is not expectedto change the qualitative behavior we describe. Thus, we cannot really studythe pure YM theory, or any other confining theory which does not involve allthe fields of the original N  4 theory as long as we are in the strong couplingregime where supergravity is a good approximation.We will see below that, while we can find ways to get around the first problem andgive masses to the scalar fields, there are no known ways to solve the second problemand study interesting confining field theories using the supergravity approximation. Ofcourse, in the full string theory there is no such problem, and the mass deformationdescribed above, for small , gives an implicit string theory construction of the nonsupersymmetric pure YM theory.In the rest of this section we will focus on the deformations that can arise in thestrong coupling regime, and which may be analyzed in the supergravity approximation.As described in section 3.2.1, the only operators whose dimension remains small forlarge N and large  are the chiral primary operators, so we are limited to deformations by these operators. Let us start by analyzing the symmetries that are preservedby such deformations. Most of the chiral operators are in nontrivial SU4R representations, so they break the SU4R group to some subgroup which depends onthe representation of the operator we are deforming by. Generic deformations willalso completely break the supersymmetry. One analyzes how much supersymmetry a139particular deformation breaks by checking how many supercharges annihilate it. Forexample, deformations which preserve N  1 supersymmetry are annihilated by thesupercharges Q and Q of some N  1 subalgebra of the N  4 algebra. Giventhe structure of the chiral representations described in section 3.2.1 it is easy to seeif a deformation by such an operator preserves any supersymmetry or not. Examples of deformations which preserve some supersymmetry are superpotentials of theform W  hTri1i2   in, which to leading order in h add to the Lagrangian aterm of the form hTrA1A2I1   In2  c.c.. These operators are part ofthe scalar operators described in section 3.2.1 arising at dimension n 1 in the chiralmultiplet. In order to preserve supersymmetry one must also add to the Lagrangianvarious terms of order h2, so we see that the question of whether a deformation breakssupersymmetry or not depends not only on the leading order operator we deform bybut also on additional operators which we may or may not add at higher orders in thedeformation parameter note that the form of the chiral operators also changes whenwe deform, so an exact analysis of the deformations beyond the leading order in thedeformation is highly nontrivial. Another example of a supersymmetrypreservingdeformation is a superpotential of the form W  hTrW 2i1   in2, which deformsthe theory by some of the scalar operators arising at dimension n  2 in the chiralmultiplet e.g. the dilaton deformation for n  2, which actually preserves the fullN  4 supersymmetry.The list of chiral operators which correspond to marginal or relevant deformationswas given in section 3.2.1. There is a total of 6 such operators, three of which arethe lowest components of the chiral multiplets with n  2, 3, 417. These operatorsare traceless symmetric products of scalars On  TrI1I2   In, which viewedas deformations of the theory correspond to nonpositivedefinite potentials for thescalar fields. Thus, at least if we are thinking of the theory on R4 where the scalarshave flat directions before adding the potential, these deformations do not make sensesince they would cause the theory to run away along the flat directions. In particular,the deformation in the 20 which naively gives a mass to the scalars really creates anegative mass squared for at least some of the scalars, so it cannot be treated as asmall deformation of the UV conformal theory at the origin of moduli space. We willfocus here only on deformations by the other 3 operators, which all seem to make sensein the field theory.One marginal operator of dimension 4 is the operator which couples to the dilaton,which is a 1 of SU4R, of the form TrF2  iTrF  F     . Deforming bythis operator corresponds to changing the coupling constant YM of the field theory,and is known to be an exactly marginal deformation which does not break any of the17In a UN theory there is an additional scalar operator which is the lowest component of then  1 multiplet.140symmetries of the theory.The other two relevant or marginal deformations are the scalars of dimension n 1in the n  2 and n  3 multiplets. Let us start by describing the relevant deformation,which is a dimension 3 operator in the 10 of SU4R, of the formTrAB  TrI , J K, 4.36where the indices are contracted to be in the 10 of SU4R which is in the symmetricproduct of two 4s and in the selfdual antisymmetric product of three 6s. Thisoperator is complex obviously when we add it to the Lagrangian we need to add ittogether with its complex conjugate. The coefficient parametrizing the deformationis a complex number ma in the 10 of SU4R. Deforming by this operator obviouslygives a mass to some or all of the fermion fields , depending on the exact values ofma. For generic values of ma, all the fermions will acquire a mass and supersymmetrywill be completely broken. The scalars will then obtain a mass from loop diagrams inthe field theory, so that the lowenergy theory below a scale of order ma will be thepure nonsupersymmetric YangMills theory. Unfortunately, as described above, forlarge   g2YMN this is not really a good description since this theory will confine at ascale YM of order m. However, for small  this deformation does enable us to obtainthe pure YM theory as a deformation of the N  4 theory.It is interesting to ask what happens if we give a mass only to some of the fermions.In this case we may or may not preserve some amount of supersymmetry obviously,preserving N  1 supersymmetry requires leaving at least one adjoint fermion massless. The deformations which preserve at least N  1 supersymmetry correspond tosuperpotentials of the form W  mijTrij. Choosing an N  1 subgroup breaksSU4R to SU3  U1R, and if we choose the U1 normalization so that the supercharges decompose as 4  31  13 the 10 decomposes as 10  62  32  16.The SUSY preserving deformation mij is then in the 62 representation, and it furtherbreaks both the SU3 and the U1. In a supersymmetric deformation we obviouslyneed to also add masses of order m2 to some of the scalars naively this leads to a contradiction because, as described above, there are no reasonable scalar masses to addwhich are in chiral operators. However, at order m2 we have to take into account alsothe mixings between operators which occur at order m in the deformation18 the formof the chiral operators changes after we deform, and they mix with other operatorsin particular, the form of the operator which is an eigenvalue of the scaling operatorchanges when we turn on m. In the case of the supersymmetric mass deformation, atorder m the chiral operator 4.36 described above mixes with the nonchiral TrIIoperator giving the scalars a mass, so there is no contradiction. The simplest wayto see this operator mixing in the SUSYpreserving case is to note that the N  118Similar mixings were recently discussed in 239.141SUSY transformations in the presence of a general superpotential include terms of theform Q, i   dWdi , which lead to corrections of order m to Q2,O2 which is theoperator that we are deforming by.There are two interesting ways to give a mass to only one of the fermions. One ofthem is a particular case of the SUSYpreserving deformation described above, of theform W  mTr11, which is an element of the 62 of SU3  U1, and breaksSU4R  SU2  U1 while preserving N  1 SUSY but breaking the conformalinvariance. The other possibility is to use the deformation in the 16, which breaksSUSY completely but preserves an SU3 subgroup of SU4R. To leading order inthe deformation both possibilities give a mass to one fermion, but at order m2 theydiffer in a way which causes one of them to break SUSY while the other further breaksSU3  SU2U1. At weak coupling we can analyze the order m2 terms in detail.In the SUSYpreserving deformation at order m2 we turn on a scalar mass term of theform m2Tr12  22, which may be written in the formm23Tr212  222  32  42  52  62  m23TrII , 4.37where the first term is one of the   2 chiral operators in the 20, and the second termis a nonchiral operator which arises from the operator mixing as described above theappearance of the second term allows us to add the chiral operator in the first termwithout destroying the positivity of the scalar potential. In the nonSUSY deformationthe chiral term is not turned on at any order in the deformation the 20 representationcontains no singlets of SU3, and all the scalars get equal masses from the nonchiralterm.Which theory do we flow to in the IR after turning on such a singlefermion massterm  In the SUSYpreserving case one can show that we actually flow to an N  1SCFT and, in fact, to a fixed line of N  1 SCFTs. Naively, one chiral multipletgets a mass, and we remain with the N  1 SUN SQCD theory with two adjointchiral multiplets, which is expected based on the amount of matter in the theoryto flow to an interacting IR fixed point. In fact, one can prove 419 that there is anexactly marginal operator at that fixed point, which generally has a nonzero value inthe IR theory we get after the flow described above. The full superpotential with thedeformation is of the formW  hTr12,3mTr11 where h is proportionalto gYM, and to describe the lowenergy theory we can integrate out the massive field1 to remain with a superpotential W   h24mTr2,32 for the remaining masslessfields. Naively this superpotential is irrelevant its dimension at the UV fixed pointat weak coupling is 5, but in fact one can show for instance, using the methods of387 that it is exactly marginal in the IR theory, so there is a fixed line of SCFTsparametrized by the coefficient h of the superpotential W  hTr2,32. Uponstarting from a particular value of gYM in the UV and performing the supersymmetric142mass deformation, we will land in the IR at some particular point on the IR fixed linei.e. some value of h. The unbroken global U1 symmetry of the theory becomes theU1R in the N  1 superconformal algebra in the IR.It is more difficult to analyze the mass deformation which does not preserve SUSYbut preserves SU3, since we cannot use the powerful constraints of supersymmetry.Naively one would expect this deformation to lead to masses from loop diagrams forall of the scalars, but not for the fermions, since the SU3 symmetry prevents themfrom acquiring a mass. Then, the IR theory seems to be SUN YangMills coupledto three adjoint fermions, which presumably flows to an IR fixed point this is whathappens for supersymmetric theories with oneloop beta functions of the same order,but it is conceivable also that the theory may confine and generate a mass scale. Thereis no reason for such a fixed point to have any exactly marginal deformations in fact,there are no known examples in four dimensions of nonsupersymmetric theories withexactly marginal deformations, so presumably the flow starting from any value of gYMalways ends up at the same IR fixed point. We assumed that the deformation leadsto positive masses squared for the scalars it is also possible that it would give rise tonegative masses squared for the scalars, in which case the theory on R4 would have novacuum, as described above.If we give a mass to two of the fermions, it is possible to do this with a superpotentialof the form W  mTr12 which in fact preserves N  2 supersymmetry it givesthe N  2 SQCD theory with one massive adjoint hypermultiplet, which was discussedin 433. This theory is known to dynamically generate a mass scale, at which theSUN symmetry is broken at a generic point in the moduli space to U1N1, andthe lowenergy theory is the theory of N1 free U1 vector multiplets. The behaviorof this theory for large N was discussed in 434. At special points in the moduli spacethere are massless charged particles, and at even more special points in the modulispace 435, 436, 437 there are massless electrically and magnetically charged particlesand the theory is a nontrivial N  2 SCFT. It is not completely clear which point inthe moduli space one would flow to upon adding the mass deformation to the N  4theory. Presumably, without any additional finetuning one would end up at a genericpoint in the moduli space which corresponds to a free IR theory.If we give a mass to two fermions while breaking supersymmetry as above, thisdepends on the order m2 terms that we add, we presumably end up in the IR withYangMills theory coupled to two massless adjoint fermions. This theory is expectedto confine at some scale YM which for large g2YMN would be of the order of the scalem, and lead to a trivial theory in the IR. A similar confining behavior presumablyoccurs if we give a mass to three or four of the fermions for three fermions we cangive a mass while preserving SUSY, and we presumably flow in the IR to the confiningN  1 pure SYM theory.143The only remaining deformation is the deformation by the   4 operator in the 45representation, which is in the n  3 multiplet. A general analysis of this deformationis rather difficult, so we will focus here on the SUSY preserving case where the deformation is a superpotential of the form W  hijkTrijk, with the coefficients hijkin the 100 representation in the decomposition 45  1541008064 3438.It turns out that one can prove see 387 and references therein that two of these tendeformations correspond to exactly marginal operators, that preserve N  1 superconformal invariance. This can be done by looking at a general N  1 theory with threeadjoint chiral multiplets, a gauge coupling g, and a superpotential of the formW  h1Tr123132h2Tr132333h3ijkTrijk. 4.38This particular superpotential is chosen to preserve a Z3 Z3 global symmetry, whereone of the Z3 factors acts by 1  2,2  3,3  1 and the other acts by1  1,2  2,3  23 where  is a third root of unity. The second Z3symmetry prevents any mixing between the chiral operators i, and the first Z3 canthen be used to show that they all have the same anomalous dimension g, h1, h2, h3.The beta function may be shown using supersymmetry to be exactly proportional tothis gamma function with a coefficient which is a function of g, so that the requirementof conformal invariance degenerates into one equation   0 in the four variablesg, h1, h2 and h3, which generically has a 3dimensional space of solutions. This spaceof solutions corresponds to a 3dimensional space of N  1 SCFTs. The generalarguments we used so far do not tell us the form of the 3dimensional space, but wecan now use our analysis of the N  4 theory to learn more about it. First, we knowthat the N  4 line g  h3, h1  h2  0 is a subspace of this 3dimensional space. Wealso know that at leading order in the deformation away from this subspace, h3  g,h1 and h2 correspond to marginal operators as described above they couple to chiraloperators of dimension 4, while h3  g couples to a nonchiral operator in the 15of SU4R whose dimension is corrected away from g  0 and seems to be large forlarge g2YMN. Thus, we see that to leading order in the deformation around the N  4fixed line, the exactly marginal deformations are given by h1 and h2 which are twoparticular elements of the 100 representation. It is not known if the other deformationsin the 45 are marginally relevant, marginally irrelevant or exactly marginal.4.3.4 Deformations of String Theory on AdS5  S5As described in section 4.3.1, to analyze the deformations of section 4.3.3 in the AdScontext requires finding solutions of string theory with appropriate boundary conditions. For the exactly marginal deformation in the 1, which corresponds to the dilaton,we already know the solutions, which are just the AdS5S5 solution with any value of144the string coupling IIB. The other operators discussed above are identified in stringtheory with particular modes of the 2form field Bab with indices in the S5 directions we view B as a complex 2form field which contains both the NSNS and RR2form fields. Thus, the dimension 3 mass deformation would be related to string theory backgrounds in which Babx, U, yU mY 1ab yU for some spherical harmonicsY1ab y on S5, and the dimension 4 deformations would be related to backgrounds withBabx, U, yU hY 2ab y. It is clear from the identification of the superconformal algebra in the field theory and in the string theory that these deformations break thesame supersymmetries in both cases this can also be checked explicitly say, to leadingorder in the deformation 418, 148 by analyzing the SUSY variations of the type IIBsupergravity fields. The existence of an exactly marginal deformation breaking theN  4 superconformal symmetry to N  1 superconformal symmetry suggests thatthe theorem of 438, that forbids flat space compactifications with different amountsof supersymmetry from being at a finite distance from each other in the string theorymoduli space, is not valid in AdS compactifications 418, 148.Since we know little about string theory in backgrounds with RR fields, our analysisof such solutions is effectively limited to the supergravity approximation. This alreadylimits our discussion to large   gsN , and it limits it further to cases where thesolution does not develop large curvatures in the interior. In the supergravity limit onewould want to find solutions of type IIB supergravity with the boundary conditionsdescribed above with the rest of the fields having the same boundary conditions as inthe AdS5  S5 case. Unfortunately, no such solutions are known, and they seem tobe rather difficult to construct. There are 3 possible approaches to circumventing thisproblem of finding exact solutions to type IIB supergravity  One can try to construct solutions perturbatively in the deformation parameter,which should be easier than constructing the full exact solution. Unfortunately,this approach does not make sense for the relevant deformations, since alreadyat leading order in the deformation corresponding to the linearized equations ofmotion around the AdS5  S5 solution we find that the solution Bab  1Ugrows to be very large in the interior, so the perturbative expansion does not makesense. At best one may hope to have a perturbative expansion in a parameterlike mU if m is the coefficient of a relevant operator of dimension   3,but this only makes sense near the boundary. On the other hand, for marginaldeformations, and especially for deformations that are supposed to be exactlymarginal, this approach makes sense. Exactly marginal deformations correspondto solutions which do not depend on the AdS coordinates at all, so a perturbationexpansion in the parameters of the deformation seems to be welldefined. Inpractice such a perturbation expansion is quite complicated, and can only bedone in the first few orders in the deformation. In the case of the deformation by145h1, h2 which was described in field theory above, one can verify that it is an exactlymarginal deformation to second order in the deformation, even though additionalSUGRA fields need to be turned on at this order including components of themetric with S5 indices. This is in fact true for any deformation in the 45. Atthird order one probably gets nontrivial constraints on which elements of the45 can be turned on in an exactly marginal deformation, but the equations ofmotion of type IIB SUGRA have not yet been expanded to this order. Verifyingthat the deformations that are exactly marginal in the field theory correspondto exactly marginal deformations also in string theory on AdS5  S5 would be anontrivial test of the AdSCFT correspondence. There are no known nontrivial solutions of type IIB supergravity which areasymptotically of the form described above for the relevant or marginal deformations. However, there are several known solutions 174, 121 of type IIB supergravity in addition to the AdS5  S5 solution which involve AdS5 spaces andhave SO4, 2 isometries these solutions need not necessarily be direct productsAdS5 X, and one can try to guess that they would be the endpoints of flowsarising from relevant deformations. As long as we are in the supergravity approximation, only solutions which are topologically equivalent to AdS5  S5 canbe related by flows to the AdS5  S5 solution, so we will not discuss here othertypes of AdS5 solutions.One such solution was found in 174, which is of the form AdS5X, where X isan S1 fiber over CP 2 a stretched fivesphere, and there is also a 3form fieldturned on in the compact directions this is called a PopeWarner type solution439. This solution has an SU3 isometry symmetry corresponding to anSU3 global symmetry in the corresponding field theory, and it breaks all thesupersymmetries. Thus, it is natural to try to identify it with the deformation bythe nonsupersymmetric singlefermion mass operator described in section 4.3.3,which has the same symmetries. Unfortunately, as discussed below, this solutionseems to be unstable.An additional solution, found in 121, exhibits an SO5 global symmetry. Asdiscussed below, this solution also appears to be unstable. The most successful way to date of analyzing the appropriate solutions of typeIIB supergravity has been to restrict attention to the five dimensional N  8supergravity 124 sector of the theory, which includes only the n  2 supergraviton multiplet from the spectrum described in section 3.2.1. Unlike the situation in flatspace compactifications, the five dimensional supergravity cannotbe viewed as a lowenergy limit of the ten dimensional supergravity compactification in any sense. For instance, the supergraviton multiplet contains fields of146m2  4R2, while other multiplets in the n  3, 4 multiplets which are notincluded in the truncation to the five dimensional supergravity theory involvemassless fields on AdS5. However, it is conjectured that there does exist a consistent truncation of the type IIB supergravity theory on AdS5  S5 to the fivedimensional N  8 supergravity, in the sense that every solution of the latter canbe mapped into a solution of the full type IIB theory with the other fields in typeIIB supergravity being some functions of the five dimensional SUGRA fields. Asimilar truncation is believed to exist 140, 114 and references therein for therelation between 11 dimensional supergravity compactified on AdS4S7 and thefour dimensional N  8 gauged supergravity, and for the relation between 11dimensional supergravity compactified on AdS7  S4 and the seven dimensionalgauged supergravity, and the similarities between the two cases suggest that itmay exist also in the AdS5  S5 case though this has not yet been proven19.In the rest of this section we will assume that such a truncation exists and seewhat we can learn from it. Obviously, we can only learn from such a truncationabout deformations of the theory by fields in the n  2 multiplet, so we cannotanalyze the marginal deformations in the 45 in this way.The first thing one can try to do with the five dimensional N  8 supergravityis to find solutions to the equations of motion with an SO4, 2 isometry. Thesecorrespond to critical points of the scalar potential of d  5,N  8 supergravity,which is a complicated function of the 42 20  10c  1c scalar fields in then  2 multiplet. A full analysis of the critical points of this potential has notyet been performed, but there are 4 known vacua in addition to the vacuumcorresponding to AdS5  S5 i There is a nonsupersymmetric vacuum with an unbroken SU3 gauge group.This vacuum is conjectured to correspond to the SU3invariant vacuum of thefull type IIB supergravity theory described above, which, as mentioned above,could correspond to a mass deformation of the N  4 field theory. Additionalevidence for this correspondence was presented in 148, 147, which constructed asolution of the five dimensional N  8 supergravity which interpolates betweenthe AdS5S5 solution and the SU3invariant solution, with the leading deformation from the AdS5S5 solution corresponding exactly to the mass operator inthe 16 in the decomposition 10  623216, which breaks SU4R  SU3.Since this solution is nonsupersymmetric, one must verify that the classical solution is stable, namely that it does not contain tachyons whose mass is below theBreitenlohnerFreedman stability bound in supersymmetric vacua this is guaranteed using equation 3.14, such tachyons would correspond to operators of19Partial evidence for this was given in 143. See section 2.2.5 for further discussion.147complex dimension in the field theory which would contradict its unitarity. Ithas recently been shown 440 that there are scalars in the gauged supergravitymultiplet which do violate the BreitenlohnerFreedman stability bound in theexpansion around the SU3invariant solution20 Thus, this is not a consistentvacuum of the supergravity theory. The AdSCFT correspondence then impliesthat performing this mass deformation at strong coupling leads to some instability in the field theory for instance, it could lead to negative masses squared forthe scalar fields.ii There is a nonsupersymmetric vacuum with unbroken SO5 gauge symmetry, which is conjectured to be related to the SO5invariant compactificationof type IIB supergravity which we mentioned above. The mass spectrum in thisvacuum was computed in 147, where it was found that it has a tachyonic particlewhose mass is below the stability bound. Thus, even classically this is not reallya vacuum of the supergravity theory presumably the tachyon would condenseand the theory would flow to some different vacuum. It was found in 148, 147that this vacuum is related to the AdS5S5 vacuum by a deformation involving turning on one of the operators in the 20 representation presumably theinstability of the supergravity solution is related to the instability of the fieldtheory after performing this deformation.iii There is 149, 419, 145 a vacuum with SU2  U1 unbroken symmetryand 8 unbroken supercharges, corresponding to an N  1 SCFT in the fieldtheory. There is no known corresponding solution of the full type IIB theory,but assuming that 5d SUGRA is a consistent truncation, such a solution mustexist though it is not guaranteed that all its curvature invariants will be small,as required for the consistency of the supergravity approximation. It is naturalto identify this vacuum with the IR fixed point arising from the supersymmetricsinglechiralsuperfield mass deformation described in section 4.3.3. This is consistent with the form of the 5d SUGRA fields that are turned on in this solution,with the global symmetries of the solution, and with the fact that on both sidesof the correspondence we have a fixed line of N  1 SCFTs the parameter h ofthe fixed line corresponds to the dilaton on the string theory side supersymmetryprohibits the generation of a potential for this field. Recently this identificationwas supported by the construction of the full solution interpolating between theN  4 fixed point and the N  1 fixed point in the 5d SUGRA theory 145.Since we have some supersymmetry left in this case, one can also quantitativelytest this correspondence by matching the global anomalies of the field theory20Except for orbifold constructions, there is no example at the time of writing of a nonsupersymmetric AdS5 vacuum which is definitely known to satisfy the stability bound. There arehowever nonorbifold, nonsupersymmetric AdS3 vacua which are perturbatively stable.148described in section 4.3.3 the SUN N  1 SQCD theory with two adjointchiral multiplets and a superpotential W  Tr2,32 with those of the corresponding SUGRA background, as described in section 3.2.2. The conformalanomalies were successfully compared in 419, 145 in the large N limit, givingsome evidence for this correspondence in particular, the conformal anomalies ofthis theory satisfy a  c, as required for a consistent supergravity approximation. The fact that the central charge corresponding to this solution is smallerthan that of the AdS5  S5 solution with the same RR 5form flux note thatthe RR flux is quantized and does not change when we deform means that thisinterpretation is consistent with the conjectured four dimensional ctheorem.iv There is an additional background found in 149 with SU2U1U1unbroken gauge symmetry and no supersymmetry. The mass spectrum of thisbackground has not yet been computed, so it is not clear if it is stable or not.The SUGRA solution involves giving VEVs to fields both in the 20 and in the10, but it is not clear exactly what deformation of the original AdS5S5 theoryif any this background corresponds to.In principle, one could also use the truncated five dimensional theory to analyzeother relevant deformations in the 10, which are not expected to give rise toconformal field theories in the IR. Presumably most of them would lead to highcurvatures in the interior, but perhaps some of them do not and can then beanalyzed purely in supergravity.To summarize, the analysis of deformations in string theory on AdS5  S5 is ratherdifficult, but the results that are known so far seem to be consistent with the AdSCFTcorrespondence. The only known results correspond to deformations which lead to conformal theories in the IR as discussed in section 4.3.3, these are also the only deformations which we would expect to be able to usefully study in general in the supergravityapproximation. The most concretely analyzed deformation is the singlechiralfermionmass deformation, which seems to lead to another AdStype background of type IIBsupergravity though only the truncation of this background to the five dimensionalsupergravity is known so far. In nonsupersymmetric cases the analysis of deformations is complicated see, for instance, 338 by the fact that quantum corrections arepresumably important in lifting flat directions, so a classical supergravity analysis isnot really enough and the full string theory seems to be needed.149Chapter 5AdS3In this chapter we will study the relation between gravity theories string theorieson AdS3 and two dimensional conformal field theories. First we are going to describesome generalities which are valid for any AdS3 quantum gravity theory, and then wewill discuss in more detail IIB string theory compactified on AdS3  S3  M4 withM4  K3 or T 4.AdS3 quantum gravity is conjectured to be dual to a two dimensional conformal fieldtheory which can be thought of as living on the boundary of AdS3. The boundary ofAdS3 in global coordinates is a cylinder, so the conformal field theory is defined onthis cylinder. We choose the cylinder to have radius one, which is the usual conventionfor conformal field theories. Of course, all circles are equivalent since this is a conformalfield theory, but we have to rescale energies accordingly. If the spacetime theory orthe conformal field theory contain fermions then they have antiperiodic boundaryconditions on the circle. The reason is that the circle is contractible in AdS3, and closeto the center of AdS3 a translation by 2 on the circle looks like a rotation by 2,and fermions get a minus sign. So, the dual conformal field theory is in the NSNSsector. Note that we will not sum over sectors as we do in string theory, since in thiscase the conformal field theory describes string theory on the given spacetime and allits finite energy excitations, and we do not have to secondquantize it.5.1 The Virasoro AlgebraThe isometry group of AdS3 is SL2,RSL2,R, or SO2, 2. The conformal groupin two dimensions is infinite. This seems to be, at first sight, a contradiction, since inour previous discussion we identified the conformal group with the isometry group ofAdS. However, out of the infinite set of generators only an SL2,R SL2,R subgroup leaves the vacuum invariant. The vacuum corresponds to empty AdS3, and this150subgroup corresponds to the group of isometries of AdS3. The other generators mapthe vacuum into some excited states. So, we expect to find that the other generators ofthe conformal group map empty AdS3 into AdS3 with for instance a graviton inside.These other generators are associated to reparametrizations that leave the asymptoticform of AdS3 invariant at infinity. This problem was analyzed in detail in 441 andwe will just sketch the argument here. The metric on AdS3 can be written asds2  R2 cosh2 d 2  sinh2 d2  d2. 5.1When  is large close to the boundary this is approximatelyds2  R2e2dd  d2, 5.2where     . An infinitesimal reparametrization generated by a general vectorfield , ,  changes the metric by g  g. If we want to preservethe asymptotic form of the metric 5.2, we require that 441  f e22g Oe4 ,  g e22f  Oe4 ,  f2 g2Oe2 ,5.3where f and g are arbitrary functions. Expanding the functions f Lnen ,g Lnen, we recognize the Virasoro generators Ln, Ln. For the cases n  0,1one can find some isometries that reduce to 5.3 at infinity, are globally defined, andleave the metric invariant. These are the SO2, 2 isometries discussed above. For theother generators it is possible to find a globally defined vector field , but it does notleave the metric invariant.It is possible to calculate the classical Poisson brackets among these generators, andone finds that this classical algebra has a central charge which is equal to 441c 3R2G3N, 5.4where G3N is the three dimensional Newton constant. So, this should also be thecentral charge of the dual conformal field theory, since 5.3 implies that these Virasorogenerators are acting on the boundary as the Virasoro generators of a 11 dimensionalconformal field theory.A simple calculation of the central charge term 5.4 was given in 228. Under adiffeomorphism of the form 5.3, the metric near the boundary changes tods2  R2e2dd  d2  123fd2 123gd2. 5.5151The metric retains its asymptotic form, but we have kept track of the subleadingcorrection. This subleading correction changes the expectation value of the stresstensor. If we start with a zero stress tensor, we getT R16G3N3f 5.6after the transformation. Under a general conformal transformation,   f,the stress tensor changes asT  T  2fT  fT c243f. 5.7So, comparing 5.7 with 5.6 we can calculate the central charge 5.4.It is also possible to show that if we have boundary conditions on the metric atinfinity that in the dual conformal field theory correspond to considering the theoryon a curved geometry, then we get the right conformal anomaly 226 generalizing thediscussion in section 3.2.2.5.2 The BTZ Black HoleThree dimensional gravity has no propagating degrees of freedom. But, if we have anegative cosmological constant, we can have black hole solutions. They are given by442, 443ds2  r2  r2r2  r2r2dt2 R2r2r2  r2r2  r2dr2  r2drrr2dt2, 5.8with     2. We can combine the temperature T and the angular momentumpotential  into1T 1T T, 5.9and their relation to the parameters in 5.8 is r  RT  T. The mass andangular momentum are8G3N M  R r2  r2R, J rr4G3N R, 5.10where we are measuring the mass relative to the AdS3 space, which we define to haveM  0 the scale of the mass is set by the radius of the circle in the dual CFT. Thisis not the usual convention, but it is much more natural in this context since we are152measuring energies with respect to the NSNS vacuum. Note that the mass of a blackhole is always at leastMmin R8G3Nc12. 5.11The black hole with this minimum mass sometimes called the zero mass black holehas a singularity at r  r  r  0. All these black holes are locally the same as AdS3but they differ by some global identifications 442, 443, i.e. they are quotients of AdS3.In theories that have supersymmetry it can be checked that the zero mass black holepreserves some supersymmetries provided that we make the fermions periodic as we goaround the circle 444, which is something we have the freedom to do once the circleis not contractible in the gravity geometry. These supersymmetries commute with theHamiltonian conjugate to t. Furthermore, we will see below that if we consider the nearhorizon geometry of branes wrapped on a circle with periodic boundary conditions forthe spinors, we naturally obtain the BTZ black hole with mass Mmin. This leads usto identify the M Mmin BTZ black hole with the RR vacuum of the conformal fieldtheory 444. The energyMmin 5.11 is precisely the energy difference between the NSNS vacuum and the RR vacuum. Of course, we could still have the M  Mmin BTZblack hole with antiperiodic boundary conditions as an excited state in the NSNSsector.Next, let us calculate the black hole entropy. The BekensteinHawking entropyformula givesS Area4G3N2r4G3N2c3T  T, 5.12where we used 5.4. We can also calculate this in the conformal field theory. All weneed is the central charge of the conformal field theory, which we argued had to be5.4. Then, we can use the general formula 445 for the growth of states in a unitaryconformal field theory 446, 278, which givesS  2c3T  T. 5.13Thus, we see that the two results agree. This result if valid for a general conformalfield theory as long as we are in the asymptotic high energy regime where energiesare measured in units of the radius of the circle, so in particular we need that T  1.When is the result 5.12 valid In principle we would say that it is valid as long asthe area of the horizon is much bigger than the Planck length, r  G3N . This givesT  1c, which is a much weaker bound on the temperature for large c. So, we seethat the corresponding conformal field theory has to be quite special, since the numberof states should grow as determined by the asymptotics 5.13 for energies that aremuch smaller than one would expect for a generic conformal field theory.1532 222a b cFigure 5.1 Calculation of the partition function at finite temperature through theEuclidean conformal field theory. Since the two directions are equivalent we can choosethe time direction as we wish. The partition function is dual under   42.a At low temperatures  is large and only the vacuum propagates in the  direction.b At high temperatures, small , only the crossed channel vacuum propagates in the direction. c When   2 we have a sharp transition according to supergravity.A related manifestation of this curious feature of the boundary conformal fieldtheory is the following. We could consider the canonical ensemble by going to Euclideanspace and making the Euclidean time coordinate periodic,     . We consider thecase   0, the general case is considered in 278. The conformal field theory is thendefined on a rectangular twotorus, and the free energy will be the partition functionof the theory on this twotorus. Due to the thermal boundary condition in the NSsector, the twotorus ends up having NSNS boundary conditions on both circles. Inorder to calculate the partition function in the dual gravitational theory we should finda threemanifold that has the twotorus as its boundary the correspondence tells usto sum over all such manifolds. One possibility is to have the original AdS3 spacebut with time identified,     . The value of the free energy is then given, toleading order, by the ground state energy of AdS3. This is the expected result forlarge , where the torus is very elongated and only the vacuum propagates in the channel, see figure 5.1a. For high temperatures, only the vacuum propagates in thecrossed channel fig. 5.1b, and this corresponds to the BTZ black hole in AdS3.Note that the Euclidean BTZ geometry is the same as AdS3 but on its side, with  , so now the  circle is contractible. The transition between the two regimesoccurs at   2, which corresponds to a square torus fig. 5.1c. This is a sharptransition when the gravity approximation is correct, i.e. when RG3N  c 1. Thissharp transition will not be present in the partition function of a generic conformalfield theory, for example it is not present if we consider c free bosons. When we discuss154in more detail the conformal field theories that correspond to string theory on AdS3,we will see that they have a feature that makes it possible to explain this transition.This sharp transition is the two dimensional version of the large N phase transitiondiscussed in section 3.6.2 185 in this case c plays the role of N.5.3 Type IIB String Theory on AdS3  S3 M 4In this section we study IIB string theory on AdS3  S3 M4 278, 447. Throughoutthis section M4  K3 or T 4. In this case we can get some insight on the dual conformal field theory by deriving this duality from Dbranes, as we did for the AdS5  S5case. We start with type IIB string theory on M4. We consider a set of Q1 D1branes along a noncompact direction, and Q5 D5 branes wrapping M4 and sharingthe noncompact direction with the D1 branes. All the branes are coincident in thetransverse noncompact directions. The unbroken Lorentz symmetry of this configuration is SO1, 1 SO4. SO1, 1 corresponds to boosts along the string, and SO4is the group of rotations in the four noncompact directions transverse to both branes.This configuration also preserves eight supersymmetries, actually N  4, 4 supersymmetry once we decompose them into left and right moving spinors of SO1, 11.It is possible to find the supergravity solution for this configuration see 448 for areview and then take the near horizon limit as we did in section 3.1 5, and we getthe metric in string frameds2U2g6Q1Q5dt2  dx21  g6Q1Q5dU2U2 g6Q1Q5d23. 5.14This is AdS3  S3 with radius R2  R2AdS  R2S3  g6Q1Q5l2s , where g6 is thesix dimensional string coupling. The full ten dimensional geometry also includes anM4 factor. In this case the volume of the M4 factor in the nearhorizon geometryis proportional to Q1Q5, and it is independent of the volume of the original M4over which we wrapped the branes. In the full D1D5 geometry, which includes theasymptotically flat region, the volume of M4 varies, and it is equal to the above fixedvalue in the near horizon region 449, 450, 451, 452.5.3.1 The Conformal Field TheoryThe dual conformal field theory is the low energy field theory living on the D1D5system 453. One of the properties of this conformal field theory that we will need1If M4  K3 we need that the sign of the D1 brane charge and the sign of the D5 brane chargeare the same, otherwise we break supersymmetry except for the single configuration with chargesQ5, Q1  1,1.155is its central charge, so that we will be able to compare it with supergravity. We cancalculate this central charge in a way that is not too dependent on the precise structureof the conformal field theory. The conformal field theory that we are interested in isthe IR fixed point of the field theory living on D1D5 branes. The field theory livingon D1D5 branes, before we go to the IR fixed point, is some 1  1 dimensional fieldtheory withN  4, 4 supersymmetry. This amount of supersymmetry is equivalent toN  2 in four dimensions, so we can classify the multiplets in a similar fashion. Thereis a vector multiplet and a hypermultiplet. In two dimensions both multiplets have thesame propagating degrees of freedom, four scalars and four fermions, but they havedifferent properties under the SU2LSU2R global Rsymmetry. Under this groupthe scalars in the hypermultiplets are in the trivial representation, while the scalarsin the vector multiplet are in the 2, 2. On the fermions these global symmetriesact chirally. The left moving vector multiplet fermions are in the 1, 2, and the leftmoving hypermultiplet fermions are in the 2, 1. The right moving fermions havesimilar properties with SU2L  SU2R. The theory can have a Coulomb branchwhere the scalars in the vector multiplets have expectation values, and a Higgs branchwhere the scalars in the hypermultiplets have expectation values.From the spacetime origin of the supercharges it is clear that the SU2L  SU2Rglobal Rsymmetry is the same as the SO4 symmetry of spatial rotations in the 4plane orthogonal to the D1D5 system 454, 455, 456. The vector multiplets describemotion of the branes in the transverse directions, this is consistent with their SO4transformation properties. The vector multiplet expectation values should be zeroif we want the branes to be on top of each other. We have put quotation marks sinceexpectation values do not exist in a 1  1 dimensional field theory. It is possible toshow that if Q1 and Q5 are coprime then, by turning on some of the M4 moduli moreprecisely some NS Bfields, one can remove the Coulomb branch altogether, forcingthe branes to be at the same point in the transverse directions 457, 343.Since the fermions transform chirally under SU2L, this theory has a chiral anomaly.The chiral anomaly for SU2L is proportional to the number of left moving fermionsminus the number of right moving fermions that transform under this symmetry. Thet Hooft anomaly matching conditions imply that this anomaly should be the same athigh and low energies 458. At high energies high compared to the IR fixed pointthe anomaly is ka  NH NV , the difference between the number of vector multipletsand hypermultiplets. Let us now calculate this, starting with the T 4 case. On aD1D5 brane worldvolume there are massless excitations coming from 1,1 strings,5,5 strings and 1,5 and 5,1 strings. The 1,1 or 5,5 strings come from avector multiplet of an N  8, 8 theory, which gives rise to both a vector multipletand a hypermultiplet of N  4, 4 supersymmetry, so they do not contribute to theanomaly. The massless modes of the 1,5 strings come only in hypermultiplets, and156they contribute to the anomaly with ka  Q1Q5. For the K3 case the analysis is similar.The D5 branes are now wrapped on K3, so the 5,5 strings give rise only to a vectormultiplet. The difference from the T 4 case comes from the fact that in the T 4 casethe 5,5 hypermultiplet came from Wilson lines on the torus, and on K3 we do nothave onecycles so we do not have Wilson lines. On the fivebrane worldvolume thereis when it is wrapped on K3 an induced onebrane charge equal to Qind1  Q5. Thetotal D1 brane charge is equal to the sum of the charges carried by explicit D1 branesand this negative induced charge, Q1  Qind1  QD11 459. Therefore, the number ofD1 branes is really QD11  Q1  Q5, and the number of 1,5 strings is QD11 Q5. So,we conclude that the anomaly is ka  QD11 Q5  Q25  Q1Q5, which in the end is thesame result as in the T 4 case. Note that in order to calculate this anomaly we onlyneed to know the massless fields, since all massive fields live in larger representationswhich are roughly like a vector multiplet plus a hypermultiplet, and therefore they donot contribute to the anomaly.When we are on the Higgs branch all the vectors become massive except for the centerof mass multiplet, which contains fields describing the overall motion of all the branesin the four transverse directions. This is just a free multiplet, containing four scalarfields. On the Higgs branch, at the IR fixed point, the SU2L symmetry becomes acurrent algebra with an anomaly kcft. The total anomaly should be the same, so thatka  kcft1. The last term comes from the center of mass U1 vector multiplet whichis not included in kcft. So, we conclude that kcft  Q1Q5  1. Since the U1 vectormultiplet is decoupled, we drop it in the rest of the discussion and we talk only aboutthe conformal field theory of the hypermultiplets. The N  4, 4 superconformalsymmetry relates the anomaly in the SU2 current algebra to the central charge,c  6kcft  6Q1Q5  1. Using the value for the AdS3 radius R  g26Q1Q514ls andthe three dimensional Newton constant G3N  g26l4s4R3, we can now check that 5.4is satisfied to leading order for large k. This also ensures, as we saw above, that theblack hole entropy comes out right.Now we will try to describe this conformal field theory a bit more explicitly. We startwith Q5 D5 branes, and we view the D1 branes as instantons of the lowenergy SYMtheory on the fivebranes 161. These instantons live on M4 and are translationallyinvariant actually also SO1, 1 invariant along time and the x5 direction, where x5is the non compact direction along the D5 branes. See figure 5.2a. This instantonconfiguration, with instanton number Q1, has moduli, which are the parameters thatparameterize a continuous family of solutions classical instanton configurations. Allof these solutions have the same energy. Small fluctuations of this configuration atlow energies are described by fluctuations of the instanton moduli. These modulican fluctuate in time as well as in the x5 direction. See figure 5.2b. So, the lowenergy dynamics is given by a 11 dimensional sigma model whose target space is the157aMx54bFigure 5.2 a The D1 branes become instantons on the D5 brane gauge theory.b The instanton moduli can oscillate in time and along x5.instanton moduli space. Let us be slightly more explicit, and choose four coordinatesx6, ..., x9 parameterizing M4. The instantons are described in the UV SYM theory asSUQ5 gauge fields A6,7,8,9a x6, ..., x9 with field strengths which satisfy F  4F ,where 4 is the epsilon symbol inM4 and a are the moduli parameterizing the family ofinstantons. The dimension of the instanton moduli space for Q1 instantons in SUQ5is 4k, wherek  Q1Q5 for T 4, k  Q1Q5  1 for K3. 5.15The leading behaviour for large Q is the same. In the T 4 case we have four additionalmoduli coming from the Wilson lines of the U1 factor of UQ5 460. It has beenargued in 456, 461 that the instanton moduli space is a deformation of the symmetricproduct of k copies of M4, SymM4k  M4kSk. The deformation involves blowingup the fixed points of the orbifold, as well as modifying the Bfields that live at theorbifold point. We will discuss this in more detail later. The parameter that blowsup the singularity can be identified with one of the supergravity moduli of this solution. For some particular value of these moduli which are not to be confused withthe moduli of the instanton configuration the CFT will be precisely the symmetricproduct, but at that point the gravity approximation will not be valid, since we willsee that the supergravity description predicts fewer states at low conformal weightsthan the symmetric product CFT. When we deform the symmetric product, some ofthe states can get large corrections and have high energies i.e. they correspond tooperators having high conformal weight. Other studies of this D1D5 system include462, 463, 4641585.3.2 Black Holes RevisitedWe remarked above that the BTZ black hole entropy can be calculated just from thevalue of the central charge, and therefore the gravity result agrees with the conformalfield theory result. Note that the calculation of the central charge that we did abovein the CFT is valid for any value of the coupling i.e. the moduli, so the field theorycalculation of the central charge and the entropy is valid also in the black hole regimewhere the gravity approximation is valid. This should be contrasted to the AdS5S5case, where the field theory calculation of the entropy was only done at weak couplingin two dimensions the entropy is determined by the central charge and cannot changeas we vary moduli. In 465 corrections to the central charge in the gravity picturewere analyzed.We noticed above that the gravity description predicted a sharp phase transitionwhen the temperature was T  12, and we remarked that the field theory had tohave some special properties to make this happen. We will now explain qualitativelythis phase transition. Our discussion will be qualitative because we will work at theorbifold point, and this is not correct if we are in the supergravity regime. We willsee that the symmetric product has a feature that makes this sharp phase transitionpossible.The orbifold theory can be interpreted in terms of a gas of strings 466, 467. Theseare strings that wind along x5 and move on M4. The total winding number is k. Thestrings can be singly wound or multiply wound. In the RR sector it does not cost anyenergy to multiply wind the strings. If we have NSNS boundary conditions, whichare the appropriate ones to describe AdS3, it will cost some energy to multiply windthe strings. The energy cost in the orbifold CFT is the same as twice the conformalweight of the corresponding twist operator, which is h  h  w4  O1w for aconfiguration with winding number w. If the strings are singly wound and we have atemperature of order one or 12, we will not have many oscillation modes excitedon these strings, and the entropy will be small. Note that the fact that we havemany singly wound strings does not help, since we are supposed to symmetrize overall strings, so most of the strings will be in similar states and they will not contributemuch to the entropy. So, the free energy of such a state is basically F  0. Onthe other hand, if we multiply wind all the strings, we raise the energy of the systembut we also increase the entropy 468, since now the energy gap of the system willbe much lower the multiply wound strings behave effectively like a field theory ona circle with a radius which is w times bigger. If we multiply wind w strings, withw  1, we get an energy E  w2 22wT 2, where the last term comes from thermalexcitations along the string. The entropy is also larger, S  42wT . So, the freeenergy is F  ETS  w222wT 2. Comparing this to the free energy of the state159with all strings singly wound, we see that the latter wins when T  12, and themultiply wound state wins when T  12. This explains the presence of the sharpphase transition at T  12 when we are at the orbifold point.Note that the mass of the black hole at the transition point is M  Mmin  k2,which is for large k much bigger than the minimum mass for a BTZ black hole, likethe situation in other AdSd3. We could have black holes which are smaller than this,but they cannot be in thermal equilibrium with an external bath. Of course they couldbe in equilibrium inside AdS3 if we do not couple AdS3 to an external bath to keep thetemperature finite. In this case we are considering the microcanonical ensemble, andthere are more black hole solutions that we could be considering 279, 284, 287.a bM4x 5Figure 5.3 Some configurations with winding number four. a Two singly woundstrings and one doubly wound string. b A maximally multiply wound configuration.If we were considering the conformal field theory on a circle with RR boundaryconditions, the corresponding supergravity background would be the M Mmin BTZblack hole. This follows from the fact that we should have preserved supersymmetriesthat commute with the Hamiltonian in AdS3 the preserved supersymmetries do notcommute with the Hamiltonian generating evolution in global time. In order to havethese supersymmetries we need to have RR boundary conditions on the circle. Noticethat the RR vacuum is not an excited state on the NSNS vacuum, it is just in adifferent sector of the conformal field theory, even though the M  Mmin BTZ blackhole appears in both sectors.In the case with RR boundary conditions a black hole forms as soon as we raisethe temperature beyond T  1k. This seems at first sight paradoxical, since thetemperature could be much smaller than one, which would be the natural energy gapfor a generic conformal field theory on a circle. The reason that the energy gap is verysmall for this conformal field theory is due to the presence of long, multiply woundstrings. In the RR sector all multiply wound strings have the same energy. But, as we160saw before, multiply wound strings lead to higher entropy states so they are preferred.In fact, one can estimate the energy gap of the system by saying that it will be ofthe order of the minimum energy excitation that can exist on a string multiply woundktimes, which is of the order of 1k. This estimate of the energy gap agrees with asemiclassical estimate as follows. We can trust the thermodynamic approximation forblack holes as long as the specific heat is large enough 469. For any system we needa large specific heat, Ce  ET , in order to trust the thermodynamic approximation. Inthis case E  kT 2, so the condition Ce  1 boils down to E  1k . So, this estimateof the energy gap agrees with the conformal field theory estimate. Note that in the RRsupergravity vacuum the M  Mmin black hole we could seemingly have arbitrarilylow energy excitations as waves propagating on this space. The boundary condition onthese waves at the singularity should be such that one gets the above gap, but in thegravity approximation k   and this gap is not seen. Note also that the M Mminblack hole does not correspond to a single state as opposed to the AdS3 vacuum, butto a large number of states, of the order of e22k for T 4 case and e24k for K32.There are other black holes that preserve some supersymmetries, which are extremalBTZ black holes with M  Mmin  J 444. J is the angular momentum in AdS3,identified with the momentum along the S1 in the CFT. Of course, these black holeswill preserve supersymmetry only if the boundary conditions on S1 are periodic, i.e.only if we are considering the RR sector of the theory. In the RR sector it becomes morenatural to measure energies so that the RR vacuum has zero energy. The extremalblack holes correspond to states in the CFT in the RR sector with no left movingenergy, L0  0, and some right moving energy, L0  J  0. The entropy of thesestates isS  2kJ. 5.16This is the entropy as long as kL0 is large, even for L0  1. The reason for this is againthe presence of multiply wound strings, that ensure that the asymptotic formula forthe number of states in a conformal field theory is reached at very low values of L0. Inthis argument it is important that we are in the RR sector, and since we are countingBPS states we can deform the theory until we are at the symmetric product point, andthen the argument we gave in terms of multiply wound strings is rigorous 13, 460.It is possible to consider also black holes which carry angular momentum on S3.They are characterized by the eigenvalues JL, JR, of J3L and J3R of SU2L  SU2R.These rotating black holes can be found by taking the near horizon limit of rotatingblack strings in six dimensions 470, 471. Their metric is locally AdS3  S3 but withsome discrete identifications 472. Cosmic censorship implies that their mass has a2An easy way to calculate this number of BPS states is to consider this configuration as a systemof D1D5 branes on S1M4 and then do a Uduality transformation, transforming this into a systemof fundamental string momentum and winding.161lower boundE  M Mmin  J2Lk  J2Rk. 5.17We can also calculate the entropy for a general configuration carrying angular momentaJL,R on S3, linear momentum J on S1, and energy E M Mmin S  2kE  J2 J2L  2kE  J2 J2R. 5.18We can understand this formula in the following way 473, 454. If we bosonize theU1 currents, JL  k2, and similarly for JR, we can construct the operator eiJLwith conformal weight J2Lk. This explains why the minimum mass is 5.17. This alsoexplains 5.18, since only a portion of the energy equal to L0J2Lk  EJ2J2Lkcan be distributed freely among the oscillators3.5.3.3 Matching of ChiralChiral PrimariesThe CFT we are discussing here, and also its string theory dual, have moduli parameters of the field theory. At some point in the moduli space the symmetric productdescription is valid, and at that point the gravity description is strongly coupled andcannot be trusted. As we move away from that point we can get to regions in modulispace where we can trust the gravity description. The energies of most states willchange when we change the moduli. There are, however, states that are protected,whose energies are not changed. These are chiral primary states 475. The superconformal algebra contains terms of the form4Qr , Qs   2Lrs  2r  sJ3rs c3rsr2  14,Qr , Qs   2Lrs  2r  sJ3rs c3rsr2  14,5.19where Qr  Qr , and r, s  Z  12. The generators that belong to the globalsupergroup which leaves the vacuum and AdS3 invariant have r, s  12. The firstsuperscript indicates the eigenvalues under the global J30 generator of SU2, and thesecond superscript corresponds to a global SU2 exterior automorphism of the algebrawhich is not associated to a symmetry in the theory. If we take a state h which hasL0  J30 , then we see from 5.19 that Q12h has zero norm, so in a unitary fieldtheory it should be zero. Thus, these states are annihilated by Q12. Moreover, ifa state is annihilated by Q12 then L0  J30 . These states are called right chiralprimaries, and if L0  J30 it is a left chiral primary. The possible values of J30 for chiral3Other black holes were studied in 474.4Our normalization for J30 follows the standard SU2 practice and differs by a factor of two fromthe U1 current in 475, 278, 447, 476.162primaries are bounded by J30  c6  k. This can be seen by computing the norm ofQ32h. Note that k is the level of the SU2 current algebra. The values of J30 forgeneric states are not bounded. The spins of SU2 current algebra primary fields arebounded by J30  k2, which is not the same as the bound on chiral primaries.Let us now discuss the structure of the supermultiplets under the SU1, 12 subgroupof the N  4 algebra 477. This is the subgroup generated by the supercharges withr, s  12 in 5.19, plus the global SU2 generators Ja0 and the SL2,R subgroupof the Virasoro algebra. The structure of these multiplets is the following. By actingwith Q12 on a state we lower its energy, which is the L0 eigenvalue. Energies are allpositive in a unitary conformal field theory, since L0 eigenvalues are related to scalingdimensions of fields which should be positive. So, we conclude that at some point Q12will annihilate the state. Such a state is also annihilated by L1 5.19. We call sucha state a primary, or highest weight, state. Then, we can generate all other states byacting with Q12. See figure 5.4. This will give in general a set of 1  4  6  4  1states, where we organized the states according to their level. On each of these stateswe can then act with arbitrary powers of L1. However, we could also have a shortrepresentation where some of theQ12 operators annihilate the state. This will happenwhen L0  J30 , i.e. only when we have a chiral primary or an antichiral primary.Since by SU2 symmetry each chiral primary comes with an antichiral primary, weconcentrate on chiral primaries. These short multiplets are of the formstates J30 L00 j jQ120 j  12 j  12Q12Q120 j  1 j  1.5.20The multiplet includes four states which are SL2,R primaries, except in the casethat j  12 when the last state is missing. We get a similar structure if we considerthe rightmoving part of the supergroup.We will first consider states that are left and right moving chiral primaries, withL0  J30 and L0  J30 . From now on we drop the indices on J30 , J30 , and denote thechiral primaries by j, j. By acting with Q12 and Q12 we generate the wholesupermultiplet. We will calculate the spectrum of chiralchiral primaries both in stringtheory in the gravity approximation and in the conformal field theory at the orbifoldpoint. Since these states lie in short representations we might expect that they remainin short representations also after we deform the theory away from the orbifold point.Actually this argument is not enough, since in principle short multiplets could combineand become long multiplets. In the K3 case we can give a better argument. We willsee that all chiral primaries that appear are bosonic in nature, while we see from figure5.4 that we need some bosonic and some fermionic chiral primaries to make a longmultiplet. Therefore, all chiral primaries must remain for any value of the moduli.163..... .. ..121212412  j j12 j1hFigure 5.4 Structure of SU1, 12 multiplets. We show the spectrum of possible jsand conformal weights. We show only the SL2,R primaries that appear in eachmultiplet and their degeneracies. The minus sign denotes opposite statistics. The fullsquare is a long multiplet. The encircled states form a short multiplet. Four shortmultiplets can combine into a long multiplet.Let us start with the conformal field theory. Since these states are protected bysupersymmetry we can go to the orbifold point SymM4k. The chiral primaries inthis case can be understood as follows. In a theory with N  4, 4 supersymmetry wecan do calculations in the RR sector and then translate them into results about the NSNS sector. This process is called spectral flow, and it amounts to an automorphismof the N  4 algebra. Under spectral flow, the chiral primaries of the NSNS sectorthat we are interested in are in one to one correspondence with the ground statesof the RR sector. It is easier to compute the properties of the RR ground states ofthe theory. Orbifold conformal field theories, like SymM4k, can be thought of asdescribing a gas of strings winding on a circle, the circle where the CFT is defined,with total winding number k and moving on M4. The ground state energies of asingly wound string and a multiply wound string are the same if we are in the RRsector. Then, we can calculate a partition function over the RR ground states. It ismore convenient to relax the constraint on the total winding number by introducinga chemical potential for the winding number, and then we can recover the result withfixed winding number by extracting the appropriate term in the partition function as in466. Since our conformal field theory has fixed k we will be implicitly assuming thatwe are extracting the appropriate term from the partition function. The RR groundstates for the strings moving on M4 are the same as the ground states of a quantummechanical supersymmetric sigma model on M4. It was shown by Witten 478 that164these are in onetoone correspondence with the harmonic forms on M4. Let us denoteby hrs the number of harmonic forms of holomorphic degree r and antiholomorphicdegree s. States with degree r  s odd are fermionic, and states with r  s even arebosonic. In the case of K3 h00  h22  h20  h02  1 and h11  20. In the case ofT 4 h00  h22  h20  h02  1, h01  h10  h12  h21  2, and h11  4. A form withdegrees r, s gives rise to a state with angular momenta j, j  r 12, s 12.The partition function in the RR sector becomes 466k0pkTrSymM4k 12J2JyJ yJ  1n1r,s1 pnyr12ys121rshrs, 5.21where the trace is over the ground states of the RR sector. Spectral flow boils downto the replacement p  py12y12. Thus, we get the NSNS partition function, givinga prediction for the chiral primaries,kpkTrSymM4k 12J2JyJ yJ  1n0r,s1 pn1ynr2yns21rshrs,5.22where here the trace is over the chiralchiral primaries in the NSNS sector.Now, we should compare this with supergravity. In supergravity we start by calculating the spectrum of single particle chiralchiral primaries. We then calculate thefull spectrum by considering multiparticle states. Each single particle state contributeswith a factor 1 yjy jdj,j to the partition function, were dj, j is the total numberof single particle states with these spins. The supergravity spectrum was calculated in278, 479, 480, 447. The number of single particle states is given byj,jdj, jyjy j n,r,s0hrsynr2 yns2  1. 5.23We have excluded the identity, which is not represented by any state in supergravity.So, the gravity partition function is given byTrSugra12J2JyJ yJ cc primaries 1n0r,s1 ynr2yns21rshrs, 5.24where means that we are not including the term with n  r  s  0.Let us discuss some the particles appearing in 5.23 and 5.24 more explicitly. Someof them are special because they carry only left moving quantum numbers or only rightmoving quantum numbers. For example, we have the 0, 1 and 1, 0 states that arerelated to the SU2L and SU2R gauge fields on AdS3. These SU2 symmetriescome from the SO4 isometries of the 3sphere. These gauge fields have a ChernSimons action 481, 138 and they give rise to SU2 current algebras on the boundary25, 154. The chiral primary in the current algebra is the operator J1, which has165the quantum numbers mentioned above. When we apply Q12Q12 to this statewe get the left moving stress tensor. Again, this should correspond to part of thephysical modes of gravity on AdS3. Pure gravity in three dimensions is a theory withno local degrees of freedom. In fact, it is equivalent to an SL2,R SL2,R ChernSimons theory 481, 482, 483, 484. This gives rise to some physical degrees of freedomliving at the boundary. It was argued that we get a Liouville theory at the boundary485, 486, 487, 488, 489, which includes a stress tensor operator. In the T 4 case wealso have some other special particles which correspond to fermion zero modes 12, 0and 0, 12. These fermion zero modes are the supersymmetric partners of the U1currents associated to isometries of T 4. The six dimensional theory corresponding totype IIB string theory on T 4 has 16 vector fields transforming in the spinor of SO5, 5.From the symmetric product we get only 8 currents 4L  4R. The other eight arepresumably related to an extra copy of T 4 appearing in the CFT due to the Wilsonlines of the U1 in UQ5 460, 490.Besides these purely leftmoving or purely rightmoving modes, which are not so easyto see in supergravity, all other states arise as local bulk excitations of supergravityfields on AdS3 and are clearly present. Higher values of j typically correspond tohigher KaluzaKlein modes of lower j fields. More precisely, we have n 12, 12states where n  h11  1 278, 479, 447. By applying Qs, each of these states givesrise to four SU2neutral scalar fields, which have conformal weights h  h  1.Therefore, they correspond to massless fields in spacetime by 3.14. These are the 4nmoduli of the supergravity compactification, which are identified with the moduli ofthe conformal field theory. In the conformal field theory 4h11 of them correspond todeformations of each copy of M4 in the symmetric product, while the extra four areassociated to a blowup mode, the blowup mode of the Z2 singularity that arises whenwe exchange two copies of M4. Next, we have n  1 fields with quantum numbers1, 1, n of these are higher order Kaluza Klein modes of the n fields we had before,and the new one corresponds to deformations of the S3. Each of these states gives riseto SU2neutral fields with positive mass, since we have to apply Qs twice and we geth  h  2. These are the n fixed scalars of the supergravity background plus one morefield related to changing the size of the S3. The fields with j, js above these valuesare just higher Kaluza Klein modes of the fields we have already mentioned explicitly.See 278, 479, 447 for a more systematic treatment and derivation of these results.Now, we want to compare the supergravity result with the gauge theory results.In 5.22 there is an exclusion principle since the total power of p has to be pk,thus limiting the total number of particles. In supergravity 5.24 we do not have anyindication of this exclusion principle. Even if we did not know about the conformalfield theory, from the fact that there is an N  4 superconformal spacetime symmetrywe get a bound on the angular momentum of the chiral primaries j  k. However, this166bound is less restrictive than implied by 5.22. There are multiparticle states withj  k that are excluded from 5.22. The bounds from 5.22 appear for very largeangular momenta and, therefore, very large energies, where we would not necessarilytrust the gravity approximation. In fact, the gravity result and the conformal fieldtheory result match precisely, as long as the conformal weight or spin of the chiralprimaries is j, j  k2. One can show that the gravity description exactly matchesthe k   limit of 5.22 447. This limit is extracted from 5.22 by noticing thatthere is a factor of 1p in the denominator, which is related to the identity operator.So, we can extract the k   limit by multiplying 5.22 by 1  p and settingp  1. In principle, we could get precise agreement between the conformal fieldtheory calculation and the supergravity calculation if we incorporate the exclusionprinciple by assigning a degree to each supergravity field, as explained in 476,and then considering only multiparticle states with degree smaller than k. One canfurther wonder whether there is something special that happens at j  k2, when theexclusion principle starts making a difference. Since we are considering states withhigh conformal weight and angular momentum it is natural to wonder whether thereare any black hole states that could appear. There are black holes which carry angularmomentum on S3. These black holes are characterized by the two angular momentaJL, JR, of SU2LSU2R. The minimum black hole mass for given angular momentawas given in 5.17, MminJL, JR  k2  J2Lk  J2Rk, where we used c  6k and5.4. We see that these masses are always bigger than the mass of the chiral primarystates with angular momenta JL, JR, except when JL  JR  k2. So we see thatsomething special is happening at j  k2, since at this point a black hole appearsas a chiral primary state. Connections between this exclusion principle and quantumgroups and noncommutative geometry were studied in 491, 492.5.3.4 Calculation of the Elliptic Genus in SupergravityWe could now consider states which are left moving chiral primaries and anything onthe right moving side. These states are also in small representations, and one mightbe tempted to compute the spectrum of chiral primaries at the orbifold point and thentry to match it to supergravity. However, this is not the correct thing to do, and infact the spectrum does not match 493. It is not correct because some chiral primarystates could pair up and become very massive nonchiral primaries. In the case ofchiralanything states, a useful tool to count the number of states, which gives a resultthat is independent of the deformations of the theory, is the elliptic genus, which isthe partition functionZk  TrRR12j2jqL0 qL0yj. 5.25167This receives contributions only from the left moving ground states, L0  0. Thesestates map into chiral, anything under spectral flow, i.e. states that are chiral primaries on the left moving side but are unrestricted on the right moving side.The number of states contributing to the elliptic genus goes like e2nk for largepowers qn. This raised some doubts that 5.25 would agree with supergravity. Theelliptic genus diverges when we take the limit k  . The origin of this divergence isthe contribution of the 2, 0 form, which is a chiral primary on the left but it carrieszero conformal weight on the right. So, we get a contribution of order k from the factthat this state could be occupied k times without changing the powers of q or y. Thefunction that has a smooth limit in the k   limit is then ZNSk k. In the K3 casethis function islimkZNSkkm11 qm2y1221 qm2y1221 qm220m11 qm2ym2241 qm2ym224. 5.26We can now compare this expression to the supergravity result. In the supergravityresult we explicitly exclude the contribution of the 2, 0 form, since it is directly relatedto the factor of k that we extracted, but we keep the contribution of the 0, 2 form andthe rest of the fields. The supergravity result then agrees precisely with 5.26 476.Both in the supergravity calculation and in the conformal field theory calculation atthe orbifold point there are many fields of the form chiral,anything, but most ofthem cancel out to give 5.26. For example, we can see that the only supergravitysingle particle states that contribute for large powers of y12 are the chiral, chiraland chiral, antichiral states. One can further incorporate the exclusion principle insupergravity by assigning degrees to the various fields, and then one finds that theelliptic genus agrees up to powers of qh with h  k  14 476. Here again this isthe point where a black hole starts contributing to the elliptic genus. It is an extremalrotating black hole with angular momentum JL  k2 and JR  0, which has L0  k4and L0  k2.5.4 Other AdS3 CompactificationsWe start by discussing the compactifications discussed in the last section more broadly,and then we will discuss other AdS3 compactifications. In the previous section westarted out with type IIB string theory compactified on M4 to six dimensions. Thetheory has many charges carried by string like objects, which come from branes wrapping on various cycles of M4. These charges transform as vectors under the dualitygroup of the theory SO5, n, where n  21, 5 for the K3 and T 4 cases respectively.These 5  n strings correspond to the fundamental and D strings, the NS and D fivebranes wrapped on M4, and to D3 branes wrapped on the n  1 twocycles of M4. A168general charge configuration is given by a vector qI transforming under SO5, n. Theradius of curvature of the gravity solution is proportional to q2, R4  q2, where we usethe SO5, n metric. In the K3 case q2  0 for supersymmetric configurations. The sixdimensional spacetime theory has 5n massless scalar fields, which parameterize thecoset manifold SO5, nSO5  SOn 494. When we choose a particular chargevector, with q2  0, we break the duality group to SO4, n, and out of the original 5nmassless scalars n becomes massive and have values determined by the charges andthe other scalars 495. The remaining 4n scalars are massless and represent moduliof the supergravity compactification and, therefore, moduli of the dual conformal fieldtheory. Note that the conformal field theory involves the instanton moduli space, buthere the word moduli refers to the parameters of the CFT, such as the shape of T 4,etc.If we start moving in this moduli space we sometimes find that the gravity solutionis best described by doing duality transformations 457, 343. One interesting regionin moduli space is when the system is best described in terms of a system of NSfivebranes and fundamental strings. This is the Sdual version of the D1D5 systemthat we were considering above. In this NS background the radius of the S3 and of AdS3is R2  Q5, and it is independent of Q1. Actually, Q1 only enters through the sixdimensional string coupling, which in this case is a fixed scalar g26  Q5Q1. The volumeofM4 is a free scalar in this case. The advantage of this background is that one can solvestring theory on it to all orders in , since it is a WZW model, actually an SL2,RSU2 WZW model. String propagation in SL2,R WZW models were studied in496, 497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502, 503, 504, 505, 506, 507, 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513,514, 515, 516. Thus, in this case we can also consider states corresponding to massivestring modes, etc. We can also define the spacetime Virasoro generators in the fullstring theory, and check that they act on string states as they should 509, 510, 5115. Inthe string theory description the Virasoro symmetry appears directly in the formalismas a spacetime symmetry. One can also study Dbranes in these AdS3 backgrounds519. Conditions for spacetime supersymmetry for string theory on SL2,R WZWbackgrounds were studied in 520, 521. In the D1D5 configuration it is much harderto solve string theory, since RR backgrounds are involved. Classical actions for stringson these backgrounds were written in 522, 523, 524. However, a formulation of stringtheory on these backgrounds was proposed in 525 see also 526, 521, 527. Forsome values of the moduli the CFT is singular. What this means is that we will havea continuum of states in the cylinder picture. In the picture with NS charges thishappens, for example, when all RR Bfields on M4 are zero. This continuum of statescomes from fundamental strings stretching close to the boundary of AdS3. These states5Configurations with NS fluxes that lead to AdS2d1 spaces where studied in 517. It has alsobeen suggested 518 that 2,1 strings can describe AdS3 spaces.169have finite energy, even though they are long, due to the interaction with the constantthree form field strength, H  dBNS, on AdS3 342, 343.A simple variation of the previous theme is to quotient orbifold the threesphere bya ZN  SU2L. This preserves N  4, 0 supersymmetry. This quotient changes thecentral charge of the theory by a factor of N through 5.4 since the volume of the S3is smaller by a factor of N. It is also possible to obtain this geometry by consideringthe near horizon behavior of a D1D5  KK monopole system, or equivalently a D1D5system near an AN singularity. It is possible to analyze the field theory by using themethods in 344, and using the above anomaly argument one can calculate the rightmoving central charge. The left moving central charge should be calculated by a moredetailed argument. When we have NS 5 branes and fundamental strings on an ANsingularity, the worldsheet theory is solvable, and one can calculate the spectrum ofmassive string states, etc. 528. One can also consider also both RR and NS fluxessimultaneously 529. Other papers analyzing aspects of these quotients or orbifoldsare 530, 530, 531, 532, 533.A related configuration arises if we consider Mtheory on M6, where M6  T 6, T 2 K3 or CY3, and we wrap M5 branes on a fourcycle in M6 with nonvanishing tripleselfintersection number. Then, we get a string in five dimensions, and the near horizongeometry of the supergravity solution is AdS3  S2 M6f , where the subscript on M6findicates that the vector moduli of M6 are fixed scalars. In this case we get againan N  0, 4 theory, and the SU2R symmetry is associated to rotations of thesphere. It is possible to calculate the central charge by counting the number of moduliof the brane configuration. Some of the moduli correspond to geometric deformationsand some of them correspond to Bfields on the fivebrane worldvolume 534, 535. Asupergravity analysis of this compactification was done in 447, 536.Another interesting case is string theory compactified on AdS3S3S3S1, whichhas a large N  4 symmetry 537, 538, 539. This algebra is sometimes called A. Itincludes an SU2k  SU2k  U1 current algebra. The relative sizes of the levelsof the two SU2 factors are related to the relative sizes of the radii of the spheres.This case seems to be conceptually simpler than the case with an M4, since all thespacetime dimensions are associated to a symmetry of the system6. In 537 a geometrylike this was obtained from branes, except that the S1 was replaced by R, and it is notclear which brane configuration gives the geometry with the S1. This makes it moredifficult to guess the dual conformal field theory. In 538 a CFT dual was proposedfor this system in the case that k  k. One starts with a theory with a free boson andfour free fermions, which has large N  4 symmetry. Let us call this theory CFT3.Then, we can consider the theory based on the symmetric product SymCFT3k. The6In the case of T 4 one can show that the U14 symmetries of the torus can be viewed as thek   limit of the large N  4 algebra 460.170spacetime theory has two moduli, which are the radius of the circle and the value ofthe RR scalar. These translate into the radius of the compact U1boson in CFT3and a blow up mode of the orbifold. In 539 a dual CFT was proposed for the generalcase k 6 k.Another interesting example is the D1D5 brane system in Type I string theory540, 541, 542. The N  0, 4 theory on the D1 brane worldvolume theory encodesin the Yukawa couplings the ADHM data for the construction of the moduli space ofinstantons 543, 544. What distinguishes the Type I system from the Type IIB case isthe SO32 gauge group in the open string sector. When the D5 branes wrap a compactspace M4 with M4  T 4, K3, the near horizon geometry of the Type I supergravitysolution is AdS3S3M4 542. As in the previous examples, one is lead to conjecturea duality between Type I string theory on AdS3  S3 M4 and the twodimensional0, 4 SCFT in the IR limit of the D1 brane worldvolume theory. The supergroup ofthe Type I compactification is SU1, 12  SL2,R  SU2, and the KaluzaKleinspectrum in the supergravity can be analyzed as in 447. The correspondence to thetwodimensional SCFT has not been much explored yet.The relation between AdS3 compactifications and matrix theory 26 was addressedin 545.5.5 Pure GravityOne might suspect that the simplest theory we could have on AdS3 is pure Einsteingravity. In higher dimensions this is not possible since pure gravity is not renormalizable, so the only known sensible quantum gravity theory is string theory, but inthree dimensions gravity can be rewritten as a ChernSimons theory 483, 484, andthis theory is renormalizable. Gravity in three dimensions has no dynamical degreesof freedom. We have seen, nevertheless, that it has black hole solutions when weconsider gravity with a negative cosmological constant 442 5.8. So, it should atleast describe the dynamics of these black holes, black hole collisions, etc. It has beenargued that this ChernSimons theory reduces to a Liouville theory at the boundary485, 487, 488, 546, with the right central charge 5.4. Naively, using the Cardy formula, this Liouville theory does not seem to give the same entropy as the black holes,but the Cardy formula does not hold in this case Liouville theory does not satisfy theassumptions that go into the Cardy formula. Hopefully, these problems will be solvedonce it is understood how to properly quantize Liouville theory. Since we have theright central charge it seems that we should be able to calculate the BTZ black holeentropy 446, but Liouville theory is very peculiar and the entropy seems smaller 547.Other papers studying AdS pure gravity or BTZ black holes in pure gravity include548, 286, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564,171565, 566, 567.The ChernSimons approach to gravity has also led to a proposal for a black holeentropy counting in this pure gravity theory. In that approach the black hole entropyis supposed to come from degrees of freedom in the ChernSimons theory that becomedynamical when a horizon is present 568.One interesting question in three dimensional gravity is whether we should considerthe ChernSimons theory on a fixed topology or whether we should sum over topologies.Naively it is the second possibility, however it could be that the sum over topologies isalready included in the ChernSimons path integral over a fixed topology.In any case, three dimensional pure gravity is part of the full string theory compactifications, and it would be interesting to understand it better.The situation is similar if one studies pure AdS3 supergravities 138, 486, 569.5.6 Greybody FactorsIn this section we consider an extremal or near extremal black string in six dimensions.We take the direction along the string to be compact, with radius R5  ls. We needto take it to be compact since classically an infinite black string is unstable 570, 5717.Here we assume that the temperature is small enough so that the configuration is classically stable8. We take a configuration with D1 brane charge Q1 and D5 brane chargeQ5. The general solution with these charges, and arbitrary energy and momentumalong the string, has the following six dimensional Einstein metric9 471, 572 ds2E 1 r20sinh2r212 1 r20sinh2r212 dt2  dx25r20r2cosh dt sinh dx52 1 r20sinh2r2ds2M41 r20sinh2r212 1 r20sinh2r212 1 r20r21dr2  r2d23 .5.27We consider the case that the internal space M4  T 4. In general we will also havesome scalars that are nonconstant. These become fixed scalars in the nearhorizon7It might seem that we can avoid the instability of 570, 571 by going very near extremality. Note,however, that for an infinite string it is entropically favorable to create a Schwarzschild black holethreaded by an extremal string.8A general supergravity analysis of the various regimes in the D1D5 system was given in 288.9Throughout this section we use the six dimensional Einstein metric, related to the six dimensionalstring metric by gE  e6gstr, where 6 is the six dimensional dilaton.172AdS3 limit. In this case there are five fixed scalars, which are three selfdual NS Bfields, a combination of the RR scalar and the fourform on T 4, and finally the volumeof T 4. If we take the first four to zero at infinity they stay zero throughout the solution.Then, the physical volume of T 4 isr  Volume242 v1 r20sinh2r21 1 r20sinh2r2, 5.28where v   is the value of the dimensionless volume at infinity. The solution5.27 is parameterized by the four independent quantities , , , r0. There are twoextra parameters which enter through the charge quantization conditions, which arethe radius of the x5 dimension R5 and the volume v of T4. The three charges areQ1 142v H  vr202sinh 2,Q5 142vH  r202vsinh 2,N R2r2022sinh 2,5.29where  is the Hodge dual in the six dimensions x0, .., x5 and H  is the RR 3form field.The last charge N is related to the momentum around the S1 by P5  NR5. All threecharges are normalized to be integers.The ADM energy of this solution isM R5r2022cosh 2  cosh 2  cosh 2 . 5.30The BekensteinHawking entropy isS A104G10NA64G6N2R5r302cosh cosh  cosh , 5.31where A is the area of the horizon and we have used the fact that in the six dimensionalEinstein metric G6,EN  222. The Hawking temperature isT 12r0 cosh cosh  cosh . 5.32The near extremal black string corresponds to the case that R5 is large and the totalmass is just above the rest energy of the branes. By rest energy of the branes wemean the mass given by the BPS bound,E M Q5R5v  Q1R5v. 5.33173Note that this includes the mass due to the excitations carrying momentum along thecircle. In the limit that   0 with E,R5 and N fixed we automatically go into theregime described by the conformal field theory living on the D1D5 system which isdecoupled. Instead, we are going to take here  small but nonzero, so that we keepsome coupling of the CFT to the rest of the degrees of freedom. The geometry is AdS3locally close to the horizon, but far away it is just the flat six dimensional spaceR1,4  S1. In this limit we can approximate the six dimensional geometry byds2E  f12dt2  dx25 r20r2cosh dt sinh dx52 f 12dr2  r2d23, 5.34wheref 1 r21r21 r25r2, r25  Q5v , r21  Q1v. 5.35Let us consider a minimally coupled scalar field, , i.e. a scalar field that is not afixed scalar. Let us send a quantum of that field to the black string, and calculatethe absorption cross section for low energies. This calculation was already discussed insection 1.3.3, but for the readers convenience we resummarize the computations here.The lowenergy condition is  1r5, 1r1. 5.36We will consider here just an swave configuration. We also set the momentum in thedirection of the string of the incoming particle to zero, the general case can be foundin 18, 573. Separation of variables,   eitr, leads to the radial equationhr3rhr3r  2f  0 , h  1 r20r2. 5.37Close to the horizon, a convenient radial variable is z  h  1 r20r2. The matchingprocedure can be summarized as followsfar region1r3rr3r  2  0,  AJ1rr32,near regionz1 z2z 1 i 2TH1 zz 2162TLTRzi4TH   0,  z i4TH Fi 4TL,i 4TR 1 i 2TH z,5.38where TL, TR are defined in terms of the Hawking temperature TH and the chemicalpotential, , which is conjugate to momentum on S1 1TL,R 1 TH, TL,R r0e2r1r5. 5.39174After matching the near and far regions together and comparing the infalling flux atinfinity and at the horizon, one arrives atabs  3r21r25eTH  1e2TL  1 e2TR  1 . 5.40Notice that this has the right form to be interpreted as the creation of a pair of particlesalong the string.According to the AdS3CFT2 correspondence, we can replace the near horizon regionby the conformal field theory. The field  couples to some operator O in the conformalfield theory 574 Sint dtdx5Ot, x5t, x5,0. 5.41Then, the absorption cross section can be calculated by  1Niiff dtdx5Ot, x5eik0tik5x5i2 1Niieik0tik5x5iOt, x5O0, 0ieik0tik5x5Ot, x5O0, 0,5.42where we have summed over final states in the CFT and averaged over initial states.We will calculate the numerical coefficients later. The average over initial states isessentially an average over a thermal ensemble, since the number of states is very largeso the microcanonical ensemble is the same as a thermal ensemble. So, the final resultis that we have to compute the two point function of the corresponding operator over athermal ensemble. This essentially translates into computing the correlation functionon the Euclidean cylinder, and the result is proportional to 5.40 16, 575, 574. Thisargument reproduces the functional dependence on  of 5.40. For other fields nonminimally coupled the functional dependence on  is determined just in terms of theconformal weight of the associated operator.Let us emphasize that the matching procedure 5.38 is valid only in the low energyregime 5.36. In this regime the typical gravitational size of the configuration, whichis of order r5, is much smaller than the Compton wavelength of the particle. See figure1.4. In fact, note that in the connecting region r  r5 the function  does not vary verymuch. Let us see this more explicitly. We see from 5.37 that we can approximate theequation by something like 2r25   0. From 5.36 we see that the variation of is very small over this connecting region. Furthermore, since absorption will turn outto be small, we can approximate the value of  at the origin by the value it has in flatspace. So, we can directly match the values of  at the origin for a wave propagatingin flat space with the value of  near the boundary of AdS3.175In order to match the numerical coefficient we need to determine the numericalcoefficient in the twopoint function of the operator O. This can be done for minimallycoupled scalars using a nonrenormalization theorem, as it was done for the case ofabsorption of gravitons on a D3 brane. The argument is the following. We first noticethat the moduli space of minimally coupled scalars in supergravity is SO4, 5SO4SO5. This is a homogeneous space with some metric, so the gravity Lagrangian inspacetime will includeS 1226d6xgabab. 5.43The fields a couple to operators Oa, and we are interested in computingOaxOb0 Gabx4. 5.44The operators Oa are a basis of marginal deformations of the CFT, and Gab is themetric on the moduli space of the CFT. Since the conformal field theory has N  4, 4supersymmetry, this metric is highly constrained. In fact, it was shown in 576 that itis the homogeneous metric on SO4, 5SO4 SO5 up to global identifications.Since the CFT moduli space is the same as the supergravity moduli space, the twometrics could differ only by an overall numerical factor Gab  Dgab, where D is anumber. In order to compute this number we can go to a point in moduli space wherethe CFT is just the orbifold SymT 4k. This point corresponds to having a single D5brane and k  Q5Q1 D1 branes. We can also choose the string coupling to be arbitrarilysmall. For example, we can choose the scalar  to be an offdiagonal component of themetric on T 4. The absorption cross section calculation then reduces to the one done in16, which we now review. We take the metric on the fourtorus to be gij  ij  hij ,where h is a small perturbation, and choose   h12. The bulk action for  thenreduces to1226d6x122. 5.45The coupling of h to the fields on the D1 branes can be derived by expanding theBornInfeld action. The leading term isS 12gsdtdx512X i2  h12, , x  0X1X2  fermions. 5.46To extract the crosssection we take R5  , but the volume of the transverse space176V finite, and we use the usual 2d Smatrix formulas126t, x kdk521V 2k0a12k eikx  h.c.,12gsX it, x5 dk5212k0aikeikx  h.c.,i  a12k 0, f  a1pa2q0,f Vinti 26p  qV,k0 2Q1Q52k02p02q0dp52dq52f Vinti22p5  q52  p0  q0,abs  V   32Q1Q5.5.47Since we have put the four transverse dimensions into a box of volume V , the fluxof the hij gravitons on the brane is F  1V . To find the crosssection we divide thenet decay rate by the flux. The unusual factors of26 and 12gs come fromthe coefficients of the kinetic terms for h12 and Xi 5.455.46. The leading factorof 2 in the equation for k0 in 5.47 is there because there are two distinguishablefinal states that can come out of a given h12 initial state an X1 boson moving leftand an X2 boson moving right, or X1 moving right and X2 moving left. The factor ofQ1Q5 comes from the fact that we have Q1Q5 D1 branes. Note that the delta functionconstraints plus the on shell conditions imply that p0  q0  p5  q5  2 andp  q  22.The final answer in 5.47 agrees with the zero temperature limit of 5.40. As weremarked before, the thermallooking factors in 5.40 can be derived just by doing acalculation of the two point function on the cylinder 574. Finally, we should remarkthat this calculation implies that the metric on the moduli space of the CFT hasan overall factor of k  Q1Q5 as compared with the metric that appears in the sixdimensional gravity action 5.43. This blends in perfectly with the expectations fromAdS3CFT2, since in the AdS3 region, by the time we go down to three dimensions, weget factors of the volume of the S3 and the radius of AdS3 which produce the correctfactor of k in the gravity answer for the metric on the moduli space.Of course, this absorption cross section calculation is also related to the time reversedprocess of Hawking emission. Indeed, the Hawking radiation rates calculated in gravityand in the conformal field theory coincide.Many other greybody factors were calculated and compared with the field theorypredictions 17, 573, 577, 578, 579, 574, 580, 66, 581, 582, 583, 584, 585, 586, 73, 587,588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595. In some of these references the effective stringmodel is mentioned. This effective string model is essentially the conformal field theory177at the orbifold point SymT 4k. Some of the gravity calculations did not agree with theeffective string calculation. Typically that was because either the energies consideredwere not low enough, or because one needed to take into account the effect of thedeformation in the CFT away from the symmetric product point in the moduli space.5.7 Black Holes in Five DimensionsIf we KaluzaKlein reduce, using 596, 597, the metric 5.27 on the circle along thestring, we get a five dimensional charged black hole solution ds25  231 r20r2dt2  131 r20r21dr2  r2d23 , 5.48where 1 r20sinh2r21 r20sinh2r21 r20sinh2r2. 5.49This is just the fivedimensional Schwarzschild metric, with the time and space components rescaled by different powers of . The solution is manifestly invariant underpermutations of the three boost parameters, as required by Uduality. The event horizon is clearly at r  r0. The coordinates we have used present the solution in a simpleand symmetric form, but they do not always cover the entire spacetime. When all threecharges are nonzero, the surface r  0 is a smooth inner horizon. This is analogous tothe situation in four dimensions with four charges 598, 599.The mass, entropy and temperature of this solution are the same as those calculatedabove for the black string 5.305.315.32. It is interesting to take the extremal limitr0  0 with r0e, r0e, r0e finite and nonzero. This is an extremal black hole solutionin five dimensions with a nonsingular horizon which has nonzero horizon area. Theentropy becomesS  2Q1Q5N, 5.50which is independent of all the continuous parameters in the theory, and depends onlyon the charges 5.29. We can calculate this entropy as follows 13. These blackhole states saturate the BPS bound, so they are BPS states. Thus, we should findan index, which is a quantity that is invariant under deformations and counts thenumber of BPS states. Such an index was computed in 13 for the case where theinternal space was M4  K3 and in 460 for M4  T 4. These indices are also calledhelicity supertrace formulas 600. Once we know that they do not receive contributionsfrom nonBPS quantities, we can change the parameters of the theory and go to a pointwhere we can do the calculation, for example, we can take R5 to be large and then goto the point where we have the SymM4k description.178It is interesting that we can also consider near extremal black holes, in the approximation that the contribution to the mass of two of the charges is much bigger thanthe third and much bigger than the mass above extremality. This region in parameterspace is sometimes called the dilute gas regime. In the five dimensional context itis natural to take R5  ls, and at first sight we would not expect the CFT descriptionto be valid. Nevertheless, it is experimentally observed that the absorption crosssection is still 5.40, since the calculation is exactly the same as the one we did above.This suggests that the CFT description is also valid in this case. A qualitative explanation of this fact was given in 468, where it was observed that the the strings couldbe multiply wound leading to a very low energy gap, much lower than 1R5, and ofthe right order of magnitude as expected for a 5d black hole.Almost all that we said in this subsection can be extended to four dimensional blackholes.179Chapter 6Other AdS Spaces andNonConformal Theories6.1 Other Branes6.1.1 M5 BranesThere exist six dimensional N  2, 0 SCFTs, which have sixteen supercharges, andare expected to be nontrivial isolated fixed points of the renormalization group insix dimensions see 93 and references therein. As a consequence, they have neitherdimensionful nor dimensionless parameters. These theories have an Sp2  SO5Rsymmetry group.The AN1 2, 0 theory is realized as the lowenergy theory on the worldvolume ofN coincident M5 branes five branes of M theory. The N  2, 0 supersymmetryalgebra includes four real spinors of the same chirality, in the 4 of SO5. Its onlyirreducible massless matter representation consists of a 2form B with a selfdualfield strength, five real scalars and fermions. It is called a tensor multiplet. For asingle 5brane the five real scalars in the tensor multiplet define the embedding of theM5 brane in eleven dimensions. The Rsymmetry group is the rotation group in thefive dimensions transverse to the M5 worldvolume, and it rotates the five scalars. Thelowenergy theory on the moduli space of flat directions includes r tensor multipletswhere for the AN1 theories r  N  1. The moduli space is parametrized by thescalars in the tensor multiplets. It has orbifold singularities for the AN1 theory itis R5N1SN and the theory at the singularities is superconformal. The selfdual2form B couples to selfdual strings. At generic points on the moduli space thesestrings are BPS saturated, and at the superconformal point their tension goes to zero.The AN1 2, 0 superconformal theory has a Matrixlike DLCQ description as quantum mechanics on the moduli space of AN1 instantons 601. In this description the180chiral primary operators are identified with the cohomology with compact support ofthe resolved moduli space of instantons, which is localized at the origin 602. Theirlowest components are scalars in the symmetric traceless representations of the SO5Rsymmetry group.The eleven dimensional supergravity metric describing N M5 branes is given by1ds2  f13dt2 5i1dx2i   f23dr2  r2d24 ,f  1 Nl3pr3, 6.1and there is a 4form flux of N units on the S4.The near horizon geometry of 6.1 is of the form AdS7  S4 with the radii ofcurvature RAdS  2RS4  2lpN13. Note that since RAdS 6 RS4 this backgroundis not conformally flat, unlike the AdS5  S5 background discussed above. Followingsimilar arguments to those of section 3.1 leads to the conjecture that the AN1 2, 0SCFT is dual to M theory on AdS7  S4 with N units of 4form flux on S4 5.The eleven dimensional supergravity description is applicable for large N , since thenthe curvature is small in Planck units. Corrections to supergravity will go like positivepowers of lpRAdS  N13 the supergravity action itself is of orderM9p  N3 insteadof N2 in the AdS5  S5 case. The known corrections in M theory are all positivepowers of l3p  1N , suggesting that the 2, 0 theories have a 1N expansion at largeN . The bosonic symmetry of the supergravity compactification is SO6, 2 SO5.The SO6, 2 part is the conformal group of the SCFT, and the SO5 part is itsRsymmetry.The KaluzaKlein excitations of supergravity contain particles with spin less thantwo, so they fall into small representations of supersymmetry. Therefore, their massesare protected from quantum M theory corrections. As in the other examples of theduality, these excitations correspond to chiral primary operators of the AN1 2, 0SCFT, whose scaling dimensions are protected from quantum corrections. The spectrum of KaluzaKlein harmonics of supergravity on AdS7  S4 was computed in 603.The lowest components of the SUSY multiplets are scalar fields withm2R2AdS  4kk  3, k  2, 3,    . 6.2They fall into the kth order symmetric traceless representation of SO5 with unitmultiplicity. The k  1 excitation is the singleton that can be gauged away except onthe boundary of AdS. It decouples from the other operators and can be identified withthe free center of mass tensor multiplet on the field theory side.1Our conventions are such that the tension of the M2 brane is T2  122l3p.181Using the relation between the dimensions of the operators  and the masses m ofthe KaluzaKlein excitations m2R2AdS  6, the dimensions of the correspondingoperators in the SCFT are   2k, k  2, 3,    604, 605, 606, 607. These are thedimensions of the chiral primary operators of the AN1 2, 0 theory as found from theDLCQ description2. The expectation values of these operators parametrize the spaceof flat directions of the theory, R5N1SN . The dimensions of these operators are thesame as the naive dimension of the product of k free tensor multiplets, though there isno good reason for this to be true unlike the d  4 N  4 theory, where the dimensionhad to be similar to the free field dimension for small , and then for the chiral operatorsit could not change as we vary . For large N , the k  2 scalar field with   4 isthe only relevant deformation of the SCFT and it breaks the supersymmetry. All thenonchiral fields appear to have large masses in the large N limit, implying that thecorresponding operators have large dimensions in the field theory.The spectrum includes also a family of spin one KaluzaKlein excitations that coupleto 1form operators of the SCFT. The massless vectors in this family couple to thedimension five Rsymmetry currents of the SCFT. The massless graviton couples tothe stressenergy tensor of the SCFT. As in the d  4 N  4 case, the chiral fieldscorresponding to the different towers of KaluzaKlein harmonics are related to thescalar operators associated with the KaluzaKlein tower 6.2 by the supersymmetryalgebra. For each value of large enough k, the SUSY multiplets include one fieldin each tower of KaluzaKlein states. Its SO5 representation is determined by therepresentation of the scalar field. For instance, the Rsymmetry currents and theenergymomentum tensor are in the same supersymmetry multiplet as the scalar fieldcorresponding to k  2 in equation 6.2.As we did for the D3 branes in section 4.1, we can place the M5 branes at singularitiesand obtain other dual models. If we place the M5 branes at the origin of R6  R5where  is a discrete subgroup of the SO5 Rsymmetry group, we get AdS7  S4as the near horizon geometry. With   SU2  SO5 which is an ADE group weobtain theories with 1, 0 supersymmetry. The analysis of these models parallels thatof section 4.1.1. In particular, the matching of the invariant supergravity KaluzaKlein modes and the field theory operators has been discussed in 608.Another example is the DN 2, 0 SCFT. It is realized as the lowenergy theory onthe worldvolume of N M5 branes at an R5Z2 orientifold singularity. The Z2 reflectsthe five coordinates transverse to the M5 branes and changes the sign of the 3formfield C of eleven dimensional supergravity. The near horizon geometry is the smoothspace AdS7 RP4 604. In the supergravity solution we identify the fields at pointson the sphere with the fields at antipodal points, with a change of the sign of the C2The DLCQ description corresponded to the theory including the free tensor multiplet, so it included also the k  1 operator.182field. This identification projects out half of the KaluzaKlein spectrum and only theeven k harmonics remain. An additional chiral field arises from a M2 brane wrappedon the 2cycle in RP4, which is nontrivial due to the orientifolding this is analogousto the Pfaffian of the SO2N d  4 N  4 SYM theories which is identified with awrapped 3brane 216 as discussed in section 4.1.2. The dimension of this operatoris   2N . To leading order in 1N the correlation functions of the other chiraloperators are similar to those of the AN1 SCFT. The DN theories also have a DLCQMatrix description as quantum mechanics on the moduli space of DN instantons 601.This moduli space is singular. One would expect to associate the spectrum of chiralprimary operators with the cohomology with compact support of some resolution ofthis space, but such a resolution has not been constructed yet.A different example is the 1, 0 six dimensional SCFT with E8 global symmetry,which is realized on the worldvolume of M5 branes placed on top of the nine brane inthe HoravaWitten 609 compactification of M theory on R10S1Z2. The conjectureddual description is in terms of M theory on AdS7  S4Z2 610. The Z2 action has afixed locus AdS7S3 on which a ten dimensionalN  1 E8 vector multiplet propagates.The chiral operators fall into short representations of the supergroup OSp6, 22. In611 E8 neutral and charged operators of the 1, 0 theory were matched with KaluzaKlein modes of bulk fields and fields living on the singular locus, respectively.Correlation functions of chiral primary operators of the large N 2, 0 theory canbe computed by solving classical differential equations for the supergravity fields thatcorrespond to the field theory operators. Two and three point functions of the chiralprimary operators have been computed in 612.The 2, 0 SCFT has Wilson surface observables 613, which are generalizationsof the operator given by W   expiBd in the theory of a free tensormultiplet, where  is a two dimensional surface. A prescription for computing theWilson surface in the dual M theory picture has been given in 294. It amounts,in the supergravity approximation, to the computation of the minimal volume of amembrane bounded at the boundary of AdS7 by . The reasoning is analogous to thatdiscussed in section 3.5, but here instead of the strings stretched between Dbranes,M2 branes are stretched between M5 branes. Such an M2 brane behaves as a string onthe M5 branes worldvolume, with a tension proportional to the distance between theM5 branes. By separating one M5 brane from N M5 branes this string can be usedas a probe of the SCFT on the worldvolume of the N M5 branes, analogous to theexternal quarks discussed in section 3.5. If we consider two such parallel strings withlength l and distance L and of opposite orientation, the resulting potential per unitlength is 294Vl c NL2, 6.3183where c is a positive numerical constant. The dependence on L is as expected fromconformal invariance. The procedure for Wilson surface computations has been appliedalso to the computation of the operator product expansion of Wilson surfaces, and theextraction of the OPE coefficients of the chiral primary operators 612.The six dimensional AN1 theory can be wrapped on various two dimensional manifolds. At energies lower than the inverse size of the manifolds, the lowenergy effectivedescription is in terms of four dimensional SUN gauge theories. The two dimensionalmanifold and its embedding in eleven dimensions determine the amount of supersymmetry of the gauge theory. The simplest case is a wrapping on T 2 which preserves all thesupersymmetry. This results in the N  4 SUN SCFT, with the complex gauge coupling being the complex structure  of the torus. In general, when the two dimensionalmanifold is a holomorphic curve Riemann surface, called a supersymmetric cycle, thefour dimensional theory is supersymmetric. For N  2 supersymmetric gauge theories the Riemann surface is the SeibergWitten curve and its period matrix gives thelow energy holomorphic gauge couplings ij i, j  1,    , N  1 614, 615, 616, 353.For N  1 supersymmetric gauge theories the Riemann surface has genus zero and itencodes holomorphic properties of the supersymmetric gauge theory, namely the structure of its moduli space of vacua 617. For a generic real two dimensional manifoldthe four dimensional theory is not supersymmetric. Some qualitative properties of theQCD string 618 and the  vacua follow from the wrapping procedure. Of course,in the nonsupersymmetric cases the subtle issue of stability has to be addressed asdiscussed in section 4.1. In general it is not known how to compute the nearhorizonlimit of 5branes wrapped on a general manifold. At any rate, it seems that the theoryon M5 branes is very relevant to the study of four dimensional gauge theories. TheM5 branes theory will be one starting point for an approach to studying pure QCD insection 6.2.Other works on M5 branes in the context of the AdSCFT correspondence are 619,620, 621, 622, 623, 624, 625, 626, 627, 628, 629, 630.6.1.2 M2 BranesN  8 supersymmetric gauge theories in three dimensions can be obtained by a dimensional reduction of the four dimensional N  4 gauge theory. The automorphismgroup of the N  8 supersymmetry algebra is SO8. The fermionic generators of theN  8 supersymmetry algebra transform in the real two dimensional representation ofthe SO2, 1 Lorentz group, and in the 8s representation of the SO8 automorphismalgebra. The massless matter representation of the algebra consists of eight bosons inthe 8v and eight fermions in the 8c of SO8. Viewed as a dimensional reduction ofthe vector multiplet of the four dimensional N  4 theory which has six real scalars,184one extra scalar is the component of the gauge field in the reduced dimension and thesecond extra scalar is the dual to the vector in three dimensions.An N  8 supersymmetric YangMills Lagrangian does not posses the full SO8symmetry. It is only invariant under an SO7 subgroup. At long distances it is expected to flow to a superconformal theory that exhibits the SO8 Rsymmetry see93 and references therein. The flow will be discussed in the next section. This IRconformal theory is realized as the lowenergy theory on the worldvolume of N overlapping M2 branes. For a single M2 brane, the eight real scalars define its embedding ineleven dimensions. The Rsymmetry group is the rotation group in the eight transversedimensions to the M2 worldvolume, which rotates the eight scalars.The eleven dimensional supergravity metric describing N M2 branes is given byds2  f23dt2  dx21  dx22  f 13dr2  r2d27 ,f  1 322Nl6pr6, 6.4and there are N units of flux of the dual to the 4form field on S7.The near horizon geometry of 6.4 is of the form AdS4  S7 with the radii ofcurvature 2RAdS  RS4  lp322N16. One conjectures that the three dimensionalN  8 SCFT on the worldvolume of N M2 branes is dual to M theory on AdS4  S7with N units of flux of the dual to the 4form field on S7 5.The supergravity description is applicable for large N . Corrections to supergravitywill be proportional to positive powers of lpRAdS  N16 the known corrections areall proportional to powers of l3p  N12. The supergravity action itself is in this caseproportional to M9p  N32, so this will be the leading behavior of all correlation functions in the large N limit. The bosonic symmetry of the supergravity compactificationis SO3, 2 SO8. As is standard by now, the SO3, 2 part is identified with theconformal group of the three dimensional SCFT, and the SO8 part is its Rsymmetry.The fermionic symmetries may also be identified. We can relate the chiral fields of theSCFT with the KaluzaKlein excitations of supergravity whose spectrum was analyzedin 631, 632.The lowest component of the supersymmetry multiplets is a family of scalar excitations withm2R2AdS 14kk  6, k  2, 3,    . 6.5They fall into the kth order symmetric traceless representation of SO8 with unitmultiplicity. The dimensions of the corresponding operators in the N  8 SCFT are  k2, k  2, 3,    604, 605, 607. Their expectation values parametrize the spaceof flat directions of the theory, R8N1SN . When viewed as the IR limit of the threedimensional N  8 YangMills theory, some of these operators can be identified as185TrI1...Ik where I are the seven scalars of the vector multiplet. As noted above,the eighth scalar arises upon dualizing the vector field, which we can perform explicitlyonly in the abelian case. The other chiral fields are all obtained by the action of thesupersymmetry generators on the fields of 6.5.Unlike the 2, 0 SCFTs, the d  3 N  8 theories do not have a simple DLCQdescription see 633, and the spectrum of their chiral operators is not known. Theabove spectrum is the prediction of the conjectured duality, for large N .We can place the M2 branes at singularities and obtain other dual models, as in section 4.1. If we place the M2 branes at the origin of R3R8 with  a discrete subgroupof the SO8 Rsymmetry group, we getAdS4S7 as the near horizon geometry. Oneclass of models is when   SU2SU2 is a cyclic group. It is generated by multiplying the complex coordinates z1,2,3,4 of C4  R8 by diage2ik, e2ik, e2iak, e2iakfor relatively prime integers a, k. When a  1, k  2 the near horizon geometry isAdS4  RP7 with a dual N  8 theory, which is the IR limit of the SO2N gaugetheory 604. As in section 4.1.2, one can add a discrete theta angle to get additionaltheories 634, 635. When a  1, k  2 one gets N  6 supersymmetry, while fora 6 1 the supersymmetry is reduced to N  4. Other models are obtained by noncyclic . As for the D3 branes 347 and the M5 branes 608, the invariant supergravity KaluzaKlein modes and the field theory operators of some of these modelshave been analyzed in 636.Another class of models is obtained by putting the M2 branes at hypersurface singularities defined by the complex equationx2  y2  z2  v3  w6k1  0 , 6.6where k is an integer. The near horizon geometry is of the form AdS4 H , where His topologically equivalent to S7 but in general not diffeomorphic to it. Some of theseexamples, k  1,    , 28, correspond to the known exotic sevenspheres. The expectedsupersymmetry is at least N  2 and may be N  3, depending on whether the Rsymmetry group corresponding to the isometry group of the metric on the exotic sevenspheres is SO2 or SO3. An example with N  1 supersymmetry is when H is thesquashed seven sphere which is the homogeneous space Sp2Sp1Sp1Sp1.In this case the Rsymmetry group is trivial SO1.A general classification of possible near horizon geometries of the form AdS4  Hand related SCFTs in three dimensions is given in 333, 332. Most of these SCFTshave not been explored yet.Other works on M2 branes in the context of the AdSCFT correspondence are 637,638, 639, 640, 401, 641, 642, 643, 644, 645, 339, 646.1866.1.3 Dp BranesNext, we discuss the nearhorizon limits of other Dp branes. They give spaces whichare different from AdS, corresponding to the fact that the lowenergy field theories onthe Dp branes are not conformal.The Dp branes of the type II string are charged under the RamondRamond p 1form potential. Their tension is given by Tp  1gslp1s and is equal to their RamondRamond charge. They are BPS saturated objects preserving half of the 32 superchargesof Type II string theories. The low energy worldvolume theory of N flat coinciding Dpbranes is thus invariant under sixteen supercharges. It is the maximally supersymmetricp  1 dimensional YangMills theory with UN gauge group. Its symmetry group isISO1, p SO9 p, where the first factor is the p  1 dimensional Poincare groupand the second factor is the Rsymmetry group. The theory can be obtained as adimensional reduction of N  1 SYM in ten dimensions to p  1 dimensions. Itsbosonic fields are the gauge fields and 9 p scalars in the adjoint representation of thegauge group. The scalars parametrize the embedding of the Dp branes in the 9  ptransverse dimensions. The SO9p Rsymmetry group is the rotation group in thesedimensions, and the scalars transform in its vector representation. In the following wewill discuss the decoupling limit of the brane worldvolume theory from the bulk andthe regions of validity of different descriptions.The YangMills gauge coupling in the Dp brane theory is given byg2YM  22p2gslp3s . 6.7The decoupling from the bulk field theory limit is the limit ls  0 where we keep theYangMills coupling constant and the energies fixed. For p  3 this implies that thetheory decouples from the bulk and that the higher gs and  corrections to the Dpbrane action are suppressed. For p  3, as seen from 6.7, the string coupling goes toinfinity and we need to use a dual description to analyze this issue.Let u  r be a fixed expectation value of a scalar. At an energy scale u, thedimensionless effective coupling constant of the YangMills theory isg2eff  g2YMNup3 . 6.8The perturbative YangMills description is applicable when g2eff  1.The ten dimensional supergravity background describing N Dp branes is given bythe string frame metricds2  f12dt2 pi1dx2i   f129ip1dx2i ,f  1 cpg2YMNl4su7p , 6.9187with a constant cp  262p93p27  p2. The background has a RamondRamond p 1form potential A0...p  1 f12, and a dilatone2  f p32 . 6.10After a variable redefinitionz 2cpg2YMN5 pu 5p2, 6.11the field theory limit of the metric 6.9 for p  5 takes the form 647, 648ds2  25 p 7p5p cpg2YMN 15p z3p5pdt2  dx2  dz2z25 p24d28p,6.12with the dilatone  g7p2effN. 6.13The curvature associated with the metric 6.12 isR  1l2sgeff. 6.14In the form of the metric 6.12 it is easy to see that the UVIR correspondence, asdescribed in section 3.1.3, leads to the relationship   z between wavelengths in thedual field theories and distances in the gravity solution. Through 6.11 we can thenrelate energies in the field theory to distances in the u variable.In the limit of infinite u the effective string coupling 6.13 vanishes for p  3. Thiscorresponds to the UV freedom of the YangMills theory. For p  3 the couplingincreases and we have to use a dual description. This corresponds to the fact thatthe YangMills theory is non renormalizable and new degrees of freedom are requiredat short distances to define the theory. The isometry group of the metric 6.12 isISO1, p SO9 p. The first factor corresponds to the Poincare symmetry groupof the YangMills theory and the second factor corresponds to its Rsymmetry group.For each Dp brane we can plot a phase diagram as a function of the two dimensionlessparameters geff and N 647. Different regions in the phase diagram have a gooddescription in terms of different variables. As an example consider the D2 branesin Type IIA string theory. The dimensionless effective gauge coupling 6.8 is nowg2eff  g2YMNu. The perturbative YangMills description is valid for geff  1. Whengeff  1 we have a transition from the perturbative YangMills description to theType IIA supergravity description. The Type IIA supergravity description is valid188when both the curvature is string units 6.14 and the effective string coupling 6.13are small. This implies that N must be large.When geff  N25 the effective string coupling becomes large. In this region wegrow the eleventh dimension x11 and the good description is in terms of an elevendimensional theory. We can uplift the D2 brane solution 6.12 and 6.13 to aneleven dimensional background that reduces to the ten dimensional background uponKaluzaKlein reduction on x11. This can be done using the relation between the tendimensional Type IIA string metric ds210 and the eleven dimensional metric ds211,ds211  e43dx211  Adx2  e23ds210 . 6.15 and A are the Type IIA dilaton and RR gauge field. The 4form field strength isindependent of x11.The curvature of the eleven dimensional metric in eleven dimensional Planck unitslp is given byR  e23l2pgeff g23effl2pN23. 6.16When the curvature 6.16 is small we can use the eleven dimensional supergravitydescription.The metric 6.15 corresponds to the M2 branes solution smeared over the transversedirection x11. The nearhorizon limit of the supergravity solution describing M2 braneslocalized in the compact dimension x11 has the form 6.4, but with a harmonic functionf of the formf n322l6pNr2  x11  x011  2nR1123, 6.17where r is the radial distance in the seven noncompact transverse directions andx11  x11  2R11. x011 corresponds to the expectation value of the scalar dual to thevector in the three dimensional gauge theory. The expression for the harmonic function6.17 can be Poisson resummed at distances much larger than R11  g2YM l2s , leadingtof 62Ng2YMl4su5Oeug2YM  . 6.18The difference between the localized M2 branes solution and the smeared one is theexponential corrections in 6.18. They can be neglected at distances u  g2YM , orin terms of the dimensionless parameters when geff  N12. According to 6.11 thiscorresponds to distance scales in the field theory of orderNg2YM . In this region wecan still use the up lifted D2 brane solution since it is the same as the one coming from6.17 up to exponentially small corrections. When geff  N12, which corresponds tovery low energies u g2YM , the sum in 6.17 is dominated by the n  0 contribution.189This background is of the form 6.4 with f  322Nl6pr6, namely the nearhorizonlimit of M2 branes in eleven noncompact dimensions. This is the superconformaltheory which we discussed in the previous section. In figure 6.1 we plot the transitionbetween the different descriptions as a function of the energy scale u. We see the flowfrom the high energy N  8 super YangMills theory realized on the worldvolume ofD2 branes to the low energy N  8 SCFT realized on the worldvolume on M2 branes.ugYM2 Ng 2YMNN 8    SCFTgYM2IIA  D2  braneUp lifted  D2  brane15Perturbative  SYMFigure 6.1 The different descriptions of the D2 brane theory as a function of the energyscale u. We see the flow from the high energy N  8 super YangMills theory to thelow energy N  8 SCFT.A similar analysis can be done for the other Dp branes of the Type II string theories.In the D0 branes case one starts at high energies with a perturbative super quantummechanics description. At intermediate energies the good description is in terms of theType IIA D0 brane solution. At low energies the theory is expected to describe matrixblack holes 649. In the D1 branes case one starts in the UV with a perturbative superYangMills theory in two dimensions. In the intermediate region the good description isin terms of the Type IIB D1 brane solution. The IR limit is described by the SymNR8orbifold SCFT. The D3 branes correspond to the N  4 SCFT discussed extensivelyabove.In the D4 branes case, the UV definition of the theory is obtained by starting withthe six dimensional 2, 0 SCFT discussed in section 6.1.1, and compactifying it ona circle. At high energies, higher than the inverse size of the circle, we have a gooddescription in terms of the 2, 0 SCFT or the AdS7  S4 background of M theory.The intermediate description is via the background of the Type IIA D4 brane. Finallyat low energies we have a description in terms of perturbative super YangMills theoryin five dimensions. In the D5 branes case we have a good description in the IR regionin terms of super YangMills theory. At intermediate energies the system is describedby the nearhorizon background of the Type IIB D5 brane, and in the UV in terms ofthe solution of the Type IIB NS5 branes. We will discuss the NS5 brane theories inthe next section.Consider now the system ofN D6 branes of Type IIA string theory. As before, we canattempt at a decoupling of the seven dimensional theory on the D6 branes worldvolumefrom the bulk by taking the string scale to zero and keeping the energies and the seven190dimensional YangMills coupling fixed. The effective YangMills coupling 6.8 is smallat low energies u  g2YMN13 and super YangMills is a good description in thisregime. The curvature in string units 6.14 is small when u g2YMN13 while theeffective string coupling 6.13 is small when u Ng23YM . In between these limits wecan use the Type IIA supergravity solution.When u  Ng23YM the effective string coupling is large and we should use thedescription of D6 branes in terms of eleven dimensional supergravity compactified ona circle with N KaluzaKlein monopoles. Equivalently, the description is in terms ofeleven dimensional supergravity on an ALE space with an AN1 singularity. Whenu  Ng23YM the curvature of the eleven dimensional space vanishes and, unlike thelower dimensional branes, there does not not exist a seven dimensional field theorythat describes the UV. In fact, the D6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouplefrom the bulk.A simple way to see that the D6 brane worldvolume theory does not decouple fromthe bulk is to note that now in the decoupling limit we keep g2YM  gsl3s fixed. Whenwe lift the D6 branes solution to M theory, this means that the eleven dimensionalPlanck length l3p  gsl3s remains fixed, and therefore gravity does not decouple. Another way to see that gravity does not decouple is to consider the system of D6 branes atfinite temperature in the decoupling limit. For large energy densities above extremality, EV  Nl7p, we need the eleven dimensional description. This is given by anuncharged Schwarzschild black hole at the ALE singularity. The associated Hawkingtemperature is TH  1Nl9pEV and there is Hawking radiation to the asymptotic region of the bulk eleven dimensional supergravity. Generally, the worldvolume theoriesof Dp branes with p  5 do not decouple from the bulk.The supergravity computation of the Wilson loop, discussed in section 3.5, can becarried out for the Dp brane theories. For instance for the N D2 branes theory onegets for the quark antiquark potential, using the type IIA SUGRA D2 brane solution294,V  cg2YMN13L23, 6.19where c is a positive numerical constant. In view of the discussion above, this resultshould be trusted only for loops with sizes 1g2YMN  L Ng2YM . For smallerloops the computation fails because we go into the perturbative regime, where thepotential becomes logarithmic. For larger loops we get into the AdS4  S7 region.Other works on Dp branes in the context of the AdSCFT correspondence are 650,648, 651, 652, 653, 654, 655, 656, 657.1916.1.4 NS5 BranesThe NS5 branes of Type II string theories couple magnetically to the NSNS Bfield, and they are magnetically dual to the fundamental string. Their tension is givenby TNS  1g2s l6s . Like the Dp branes, they are BPS objects that preserve half ofthe supersymmetry of Type II theories. A fundamental string propagating in thebackground of N parallel NS5 branes is described far from the branes by a conformalfield theory with non trivial metric, B field and dilaton, constructed in 658. Thestring coupling grows as the string approaches the NS5 branes. At low energies the sixdimensional theory on the worldvolume ofN Type IIB NS5 branes is a UNN  1, 1super YangMills theory, which is free in the IR. However, it is an interacting theoryat intermediate energies. At low energies the theory on the worldvolume of N TypeIIA NS5 branes is the AN1 2, 0 SCFT discussed above.The six dimensional theories on the worldvolume of NS5 branes of Type II stringtheories were argued 659 to decouple from the bulk in the limitgs  0, ls  fixed . 6.20This is because the effective coupling on the NS5 branes e.g. the lowenergy YangMillscoupling in the type IIB case is 1ls, while the coupling to the bulk modes goes likegs. However, the computation of 660 showed that in this limit there is still Hawkingradiation to the tube region of the NS5 brane solution, suggesting a non decouplingof the worldvolume theory from the bulk. In the spirit of the other correspondencesdiscussed previously, one can reconcile the two by conjecturing 215 that string or Mtheory in the NS5 brane background in the limit 6.20, which includes the tube region,is dual to the decoupled NS5 brane worldvolume theory little string theory. Inparticular, the fields in the tube which are excited in the Hawking radiation correspondto objects in the decoupled NS5 brane theory. In the following we will mainly discussthe Type IIA NS5 brane theory3.The Type IIA NS5 brane may be considered as the M5 brane localized on the elevendimensional circle. Therefore its metric is that of an M5 brane at a point on a transversecircle. In such a configuration the near horizon metric of N NS5 branes can be writtenas 647, 215ds2  l2pf13dt2 5i1dx2i   f23dx211  du2  u2d23,f nNu2  x11  2nl2s232. 6.21The x11 coordinate is periodic and has been rescaled by l3p x11  x11  2l2s. Thebackground also has a 4form flux of N units on S1  S3.3Type IIB NS5 branes at orbifold singularities are discussed in 661.192At distances larger than lsN the NS5 brane theory is described by the AN1 2, 0SCFT. Indeed, in the extreme low energy limit ls  0 the sum in 6.21 is dominatedby the n  0 term and the background is of the form AdS7  S4. This reduces to theconjectured duality between M theory on AdS7  S4 and the 2, 0 SCFT, discussedpreviously. However, the NS5 brane theory is not a local quantum field theory at allenergy scales since at short distances it is not described by a UV fixed point. To seethis one can take ls to infinity or u to infinity in 6.21 and get a Type IIA backgroundwith a linear dilaton. It has the topology of R1,5  R  S3 with g2s  e2lsN ,where  is the R coordinate. This is in accord with the fact that the NS5 branetheory exhibits a Tduality property upon compactification on tori note that in thisbackground a finite radius in field theory units corresponds to a finite radius in stringtheory units on the string theory side of the correspondence, unlike the previous caseswe discussed.The NS5 brane theories have an ADE classification. This can be seen by viewingthem as Type II string theory on K3 with ADE singularities in the decoupling limit6.20. The NS5 brane theories have an SO4 Rsymmetry which we identify withthe SO4 isometry of S3. The IIA NS5 brane theories have a moduli space of vacuaof the form R4  S1rW where r is the rank of the ADE gauge group and Wis the corresponding Weyl group. It is parametrized by the Winvariant productsof the 5r scalars in the r tensor multiplets. They fall into short representations ofthe supersymmetry algebra. We can match these chiral operators with the stringexcitations in the linear dilaton geometry describing the large u region of 6.21. Thestring excitations, in short representations of the supersymmetry algebra, in the lineardilaton geometry were analyzed in 215. Indeed, they match the spectrum of the chiraloperators in short representations of the NS5 brane theories. Actually, due to the factthat the string coupling goes to zero at the boundary of the linear dilaton solution, onecan compute here the precise spectrum of chiral fields in the string theory, and find anagreement with the field theory even for finite N stronger than the large N agreementthat we described in section 3.2.As in the dualities with local quantum field theories, also here one can computecorrelation functions by solving differential equations on the NS5 branes background6.21. Since in this case the boundary is infinitely far away, it is more natural tocompute correlation functions in momentum space, which correspond to the Smatrixin the background 6.21. The computation of two point functions of a scalar fieldwas sketched in 215 and described more rigorously in 662. The NS5 brane theoriesare nonlocal, and this causes some differences in the matching between M theory andthe nongravitational NS5 brane theory in this case. One difference from the previouscases we discussed is that in the linear dilaton backgrounds if we put a cutoff at somevalue of the radial coordinate generalizing the discussion of 175 which we reviewed in193section 3.1.3, the volume enclosed by the cutoff is not proportional to the area of theboundary which it is in AdS space. Thus, if holography is valid in these backgroundsin the sense of having a number of degrees of freedom proportional to the boundaryarea it is more remarkable than holography in AdS space.6.2 QCDThe proposed extension of the duality conjecture between field theories and superstringtheories to field theories at finite temperature, as described in section 3.6, opens upthe exciting possibility of studying the physically relevant non supersymmetric gaugetheories. Of particular interest are non supersymmetric gauge theories that exhibitasymptotic freedom and confinement. In this section, we will discuss an approach tostudying pure without matter fields QCDp in p dimensions using a dual superstringdescription. We will be discussing mainly the cases p  3, 4.The approach proposed by Witten 185 was to start with a maximally supersymmetric gauge theory on the p 1 dimensional worldvolume of N Dp branes. One thencompactifies the supersymmetric theory on a circle of radius R0 and imposes antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle. Since the fermions donot have zero frequency modes around the circle they acquire a mass mf  1R0. Thescalars then acquire a mass from loop diagrams, and at energies much below 1R0 theydecouple from the system. The expected effective theory at large distances comparedto the radius of the circle is pure QCD in p dimensions. Note that a similar approachwas discussed in the treatment of gauge theories at finite temperature T in section3.6, where the radius of the circle is proportional to 1T . The high temperature limitof the supersymmetric gauge theory in p  1 dimensions is thus described by a nonsupersymmetric gauge theory in p dimensions.The main obstacle to the analysis is clear from the discussions of the duality betweenstring theory and quantum field theories in the previous sections. The string approachto weakly coupled gauge theories is not yet developed. Most of the available toolsare applicable in the supergravity limit that describes the gauge theory with a largenumber of colors and large t Hooft parameter. In this regime we cannot really learndirectly about QCD, since the typical scale of candidate QCD states glueballs isof the same order of magnitude for QCD4, or a larger scale for QCD3 as the scale1R0 of the mass of the extra scalars and fermions. A related issue is that atshort distances asymptotically free gauge theories are weakly coupled and the dualsupergravity description is not valid. Therefore, we will be limited to a discussion inthe strong coupling region of the gauge theories and in particular we will not be ableto exhibit asymptotic freedom.194One may hope that a full solution of the classical gs  0 string theory will providea description of large N gauge theories for all couplings in the t Hooft limit. Tostudy the gauge theories with a finite number of colors requires the quantum stringtheory. However, there is also a possibility that the gauge description is valid for weakcoupling and the string theory description is valid for strong coupling with no smoothcrossover between the two descriptions. In such a scenario there is a phase transitionat   c 315, 316. This will prevent us from using the string description to studyQCD, and will prevent classical string theory from being the master field for large NQCD.In the last part of this section we will briefly discuss another approach, based on asuggestion by Polyakov 48, to study non supersymmetric gauge theories via a non supersymmetric string description. In this approach one can exhibit asymptotic freedomqualitatively already in the gravity description. In the IR there are gravity solutionsthat exhibit confinement at large distances as well as strongly coupled fixed points.6.2.1 QCD3The starting point for studying QCD3 is the N  4 superconformal SUN gauge theory in four dimensions which is realized as the low energy effective theory of N coinciding parallel D3 branes. As outlined above, the threedimensional nonsupersymmetrictheory is constructed by compactifying this theory on R3S1 with antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions around the circle. The boundary conditions break supersymmetry explicitly and as the radius R0 of the circle becomes small, the fermionsdecouple from the system since there are no zero frequency modes. The scalar fieldsin the four dimensional theory will acquire masses at oneloop, since supersymmetry isbroken, and these masses become infinite as R0  0. Therefore in the infrared we areleft with only the gauge field degrees of freedom and the theory should be effectivelythe same as pure QCD3.We will now carry out the same procedure in the dual superstring supergravitypicture. As has been extensively discussed in the previous sections, the N  4 theoryon R4 is conjectured to be dual to type IIB superstring theory on AdS5  S5 with themetric 3.5 or 3.6.Recall that the dimensionless gauge coupling constant g4 of the N  4 theory isrelated to the string coupling constant gs as g24  gs. In the t Hooft limit, N  with g24N  gsN fixed, the string coupling constant vanishes, gs  0. Therefore, wecould study the N  4 theory using the tree level string theory in the AdS space3.6. If also gsN  1, the curvature of the AdS space is small and the string theoryis approximated by classical supergravity.Upon compactification on S1 with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions,1953.6 is replaced by the Euclidean black hole geometry 181, 185 4ds2  4gsNu2hud 2 3i1dx2i   hu1du2u2 d25, 6.22where  parametrizes the compactifying circle with radius R0 in the field theory andhu  1 u40u4. 6.23The x1,2,3 directions correspond to the R3 coordinates of QCD3. The horizon of thisgeometry is located at u  u0 withu0 12R0. 6.24The supergravity approximation is applicable for N   and gsN  1, so that allthe curvature invariants are small. The metric 6.22 describes the Euclidean theory,the Lorentzian theory is obtained by changing3i1 dx2i  dt2  dx21  dx22. Noticethat this is not the same as the Wick rotation that leads to the near extremal blackhole solution 3.98.From the point of view of QCD3, the radius R0 of the compactifying circle providesthe ultraviolet cutoff scale. To obtain large N QCD3 itself with infinite cutoff, onehas to take g24N  0 as R0  0 so that the three dimensional effective couplingg23N  g24N2R0 remains at the intrinsic energy scale of QCD3. g23 is the classicaldimensionful coupling of QCD3. The effective dimensionless gauge coupling of QCD3at the distance scale R0 is therefore gsN .The proposal is that Type IIB string theory on the AdS black hole background 6.22provides a dual description to QCD3 with the UV cutoff described above. The limitin which the classical supergravity description is valid, gsN  1, is the limit wherethe typical mass scale of QCD3, g23N , is much larger than the cutoff scale 1R0. It isthe opposite of the limit that is required in order to see the ultraviolet freedom of thetheory. Therefore, with the currently available techniques, we can only study large NQCD3 with a fixed ultraviolet cutoff R10 in the strong coupling regime. It should beemphasized that by strong coupling we mean here that the coupling is large comparedto the cutoff scale, so we really have many more degrees of freedom than just those ofQCD3. QCD3 is the theory which we would get in the limit of vanishing bare coupling,which is the opposite limit to the one we are taking.This is analogous to, but not the same as, the lattice strong coupling expansion witha fixed cutoff given by the lattice spacing a which is analogous to R0 here. There,4The stability issue of this background is discussed in 663.196QCD3 is obtained in the limit g23a  0 while strong coupling lattice QCD3 is thetheory at large g23a. An important difference in the approach that we take, comparedto the lattice description, is that we have full Lorentz invariance in the three gaugetheory coordinates. The regularization of the gauge theory in the dual string theorydescription is provided by a one higher dimensional theory, the theory on D3 branes.In the limit R0  0 the geometry 6.22 is singular. As discussed above, in thislimit the supergravity description is not valid and we have to use the string theorydescription.ConfinementAs we noted before, the gauge coupling of QCD3 g23 has dimensions of mass, and itprovides a scale already for the classical theory. The effective dimensionless expansionparameter at a length scale l, g23l  lg23, goes to zero as l  0. Therefore, like QCD4,the theory is free at short distances. Similarly, at a large length scale l the effectivecoupling becomes strong. Therefore, the interesting IR physics is nonperturbative.In three dimensions the Coulomb potential is already confining. This is a logarithmicconfinement V r  lnr. Lattice simulations provide evidence that in QCD3 at largedistances there is confinement with a linear potential V r  r.To see confinement in the dual description we will consider the spatial Wilson loop.In a confining theory the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop operator exhibitsan area law behavior 664W C  expAC , 6.25where AC is the area enclosed by the loop C. The constant  is called the stringtension. The area law 6.25 is equivalent to the quarkantiquark confining linearpotential V L  L. This can be simply seen by considering a rectangular loop Cwith sides of length T and L in Euclidean space as in figure 6.2. For large T we have,when V L  L and interpreting T as the time direction,W C  expTV L  expAC . 6.26The prescription to evaluate the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop operator in the dual string description has been introduced in section 3.5. It amounts tocomputingW C expD , 6.27where D is the regularized area of the worldsheet of a string D bounded at infinityby C.197LTFigure 6.2 A confining quarkantiquark linear potential V L  L can be extractedfrom the Wilson loop obeying an area law W C  expTL.We will work in the supergravity approximation in which 6.27 is approximated byW C  expD , 6.28where D is the minimal area of a string worldsheet D bounded at infinity by C.This prescription has been applied in section 3.5 to the calculation of the Wilsonloop in the N  4 theory which is not a confining theory. Indeed, it has been foundthere that it exhibits a Coulomb like behavior. The basic reason was that when wescaled up the loop C by xi  xi with a positive number , we could use conformalinvariance to scale up D without changing its regularized area. Therefore D was notproportional to AC. When scaling up the loop the surface D bends in the interior ofthe AdS space. In the case when such a bending is limited by the range of the radialcoordinate one gets an area law. This is the case in the models at hand, in which thecoordinate u in 6.22 is bounded from below by u0 as in figure 6.3.The evaluation of the classical action of the string worldsheet bounded by the loop Cat infinite u is straightforward, as done in section 3.5 327, 665. The string minimizesits length by going to the region with the smallest possible metric component gii wherei labels the R3 directions, from which it gets the contribution to the string tension.The smallest value of gii in the metric 6.22 is at the horizon. Thus, we find thatthe Wilson loop exhibits an area law 6.25, where the string tension is given by thegii component of the metric 6.22 evaluated at the horizon u  u0 times a numericalfactor 12 124gsNu20 gsN124R20. 6.29198uxuu0cstringDFigure 6.3 The worldsheet of the string D is bounded at infinite u by the loop C.The string tends to minimize its length by going to the region with smallest metriccomponent gii, which in this case is near the horizon u  u0. The energy between thequark and the antiquark is proportional to the distance L between them and to thestring tension which is   12giiu0.The way supergravity exhibits confinement has an analog in the lattice strong coupling expansion, as first demonstrated by Wilson 664. The leading contribution inthe lattice strong coupling expansion to the string tension is the minimal tiling by plaquettes of the Wilson loop C as we show in figure 6.4. This is analogous to the minimalarea of the string worldsheet D ending on the loop C in figure 6.3. One importantdifference is that in the supergravity description the space is curved. Of course, acomputation analogous to the Wilson loop computations we described in section 3.5which would be done in flat space would also exhibit confinement, since the minimalarea of the string worldsheet D ending on the loop C is simply the area enclosed bythe loop itself.The quarkantiquark linear potential V  L can have corrections arising from thefluctuations of the thin tube string connecting the quark and antiquark. Luscherstudied a leading correction to the quarkantiquark potential at large separation L.Within a class of bosonic effective theories in flat space that describe the vibrations ofthe thin flux tubes he found a universal term, cL, called a Luscher term 666 V  L cL . 6.30For a flux tube in d spacetime dimensions c  d 224. Lattice QCD calculationsof the heavy quark potential have not provided yet a definite confirmation of thissubleading term. This term can also not been seen order by order in the lattice strong199CFigure 6.4 The leading contribution in the lattice strong coupling expansion to thestring tension is the minimal tiling by plaquettes of the Wilson loop C.coupling expansion. Subleading terms is this expansion are of the non minimal tilingtype, as in figure 6.5, and correct only the string tension but not the linear behaviorof the potential.CFigure 6.5 Subleading contribution in the lattice strong coupling expansion to thestring tension, which is a non minimal tiling of the Wilson loop. This is the latticeanalog of the fluctuations of the string worldsheet.The computation of the vacuum expectation value of the Wilson loop 6.28 basedon the minimal area of the string worldsheet D does not exhibit the Luscher term667. This is not surprising. Even if the the Luscher term exists in QCD3, it shouldoriginate from the fluctuations of the string worldsheet 6.27 that have not been takeninto account in 6.28. Some analysis of these fluctuations has been done in 300, butthe full computation has not been carried out yet.Other works on confinement as seen by a dual supergravity description are 668, 669,670, 299.200Mass SpectrumIf the dual supergravity description is in the same universality class as QCD3 it shouldexhibit a mass gap. In the following we will demonstrate this property. We will alsocompute the spectrum of lowest glueball masses in the dual supergravity description.They will resemble qualitatively the strong coupling lattice picture. We will also discussa possible comparison to lattice results in the continuum limit.The mass spectrum in pure QCD can be obtained by computing the correlationfunctions of gauge invariant local operators glueball operators or Wilson loops, andlooking for the particle poles. As we discussed extensively before, correlation functionsof local operators are related in some limit to tree level amplitudes in the dual supergravity description. We will consider the two point functions of glueball operatorsO for instance, we could take O  TrF 2. For large x  y it has an expansion ofthe formOxOy ciexpMix y , 6.31where Mi are called the glueball masses.We will classify the spectrum of glueballs by JPC where J is the glueball spin, P itsparity and C its charge conjugation eigenvalue. The action of C on the gluon fields is671C  AaTaij  AaT aij , 6.32where the T as are the hermitian generators of the gauge group. In string theory,charge conjugation corresponds to the worldsheet parity transformation changing theorientation of the open strings attached to the Dbranes.Consider first the lowest mass glueball state. It carries 0 quantum numbers.One has to identify a corresponding glueball operator, namely a local gauge invariantoperator with these quantum numbers. The lowest dimension operator with theseproperties is TrF 2, and we have to compute its two point function. To do that weneed to identify first the corresponding supergravity field that couples to it as a sourceat infinite u. This is the Type IIB dilaton field .The correspondence between the gauge theory and the dual string theory pictureasserts that in the SUGRA limit the computation of the correlation function amountsto solving the field equation for  in the AdS black hole background 6.22,gg  0 . 6.33In order to find the lowest mass modes we consider solutions of  which are independent of the angular coordinate  and take the form   fueikx. Plugging this in6.33 we obtain the differential equationuuu4  u40ufu M2ufu  0, M2  k2 . 6.34201The eigenvalues M2 of this equation are the glueball masses squared.At large u equation 6.34 has two independent solutions, whose asymptotic behavioris f  constant and f  1u4. We consider normalizable solutions and choose thesecond one. Regularity requires the vanishing of the derivative of fu at the horizon.The eigenvalues M2 can be determined numerically 672, 673, 674, or approximatelyvia WKB techniques 672, 675.One finds thati There are no solutions with eigenvalues M2  0.ii There is a discrete set of eigenvalues M2  0.This exhibits the mass gap property of the supergravity picture. In fact, even withoutan explicit solution of the eigenvalues M2 of equation 6.34, the properties i and iican be deduced from the structure of the equation and the requirement for normalizableand regular solutions 185.The 0 mass spectrum in the WKB approximation closely agrees with the moreaccurate numerical solution. It takes the formM20 1.44nn 1R20, n  1, 2, 3,    . 6.35The mass spectrum 6.35, that corresponds to a massless mode of the string in tendimensions, is proportional to the cutoff 1R0 and not to 12, which is bigger by apower of gsN 6.29. This is qualitatively similar to what happens in strong couplinglattice QCD with lattice spacing a. As we will discuss in the next section, in the strongcoupling lattice QCD description the lowest masses of glueballs are proportional to 1a.Note that in a stringy description of QCD we would expect the glueballs to correspondto string excitations, which are expected to have masses of order 12. Therefore in thesupergravity limit, gsN  1, the glueballs that correspond to the string excitationsare much heavier than the supergravity glueballs which we analyzed.The natural scale for the glueball masses of continuum QCD3 is g23N . Thereforeto get to the continuum QCD3 region we have to require g23N  1R0 which impliesgsN  1. As discussed above, our computation is performed in the opposite limitgsN  1. In particular, we do not have control over possible mixing between glueballstates and the other scalars and fermionic degrees of freedom which are at the samemass scale 1R0 in the field theory.We can attempt a numerical comparison of the supergravity computations with thecontinuum limit of lattice QCD, obtained by taking the bare coupling to zero. Sincethese are computations at two different limits of the coupling value of the originalN  4 theory there is apriori no reason for any agreement. Curiously, it turns outthat ratios of the glueball excited state masses with n  1 in 6.35 and the lowest massn  1 state are in reasonably good agreement with the lattice computations within202the systematic and statistical error bars 672, 676.As a second example consider the spectrum of 0 glueball masses. It can be computed via the field equations of the NSNS 2form field. The details of the computationcan be found in 672 and, as in the 0 case, the ratios of the glueball masses are foundto be in good agreement with the lattice computations.In closing the numerical comparison we note another curious agreement between thesupergravity computation and the weak coupling lattice computations. This is for theratio of the lowest mass 0 and 0 glueball states,M0M0supergravity 1.50,M0M0lattice 1.45 0.08 . 6.36As stressed above, the regime where we would have liked to compute the massspectrum is in the limit of small gsN or large ultraviolet cutoff 1R0. In this limitthe background is singular and we have to use the string theory description, whichwe lack. We can compute the subleading correction in the strong coupling expansionto the masses. This requires the inclusion of the 3 corrections to the supergravityaction. The typical form of the masses isM2 c0  c13R6R20, 6.37with c0 as in 6.35. The background metric is modified by the inclusion of the 3R4string correction to the supergravity action. The modified metric has been derived in290, 677. Based on this metric the corrections to the masses c1 have been computed in672. While these corrections significantly change the glueball masses, the correctionsto the mass ratios turn out to be relatively small.Lattice computations may exhibit lattice artifacts due to the finite lattice spacing.Removing them amounts to taking a sufficiently small lattice spacing such that effectively the right physics of the continuum is captured. Getting close to the continuummeans, in particular, that deviations from Lorentz invariance are minimized.Analogous artifacts are seen in the dual supergravity description. They correspondto KaluzaKlein modes that are of the same mass scale as the glueball mass scale. Thereare KaluzaKlein modes from the circle coordinate  in 6.22 that provides the cutoffto the three dimensional theory. They have a typical mass scale of order 1R0. Thereare also SO6 nonsinglet KaluzaKlein modes from the fivesphere in 6.22. In thefield theory they correspond to operators involving the SO6 nonsinglet scalar andfermion fields of the highenergy theory. They have a mass scale of order 1R0 too.The inclusion of the subleading 3 correction does not make the KaluzaKlein modessufficiently heavy to decouple from the spectrum 678, 672. This means that the dual203supergravity description is also capturing physics of the higher dimensions, or of themassive scalar and fermion fields from the point of view of QCD3. One hopes that uponinclusion of all the  corrections, and taking the appropriate limit of small gsN orlarge cutoff 1R0, these KaluzaKlein modes will decouple from the system and leaveonly the gauge theory degrees of freedom. Currently, we do not have control over the corrections, which requires an understanding of a two dimensional sigma model witha RR background. In section 6.2.3 we will use an analogy with lattice field theory toimprove on our supergravity description and remove some of the KaluzaKlein modes.6.2.2 QCD4One starting point for obtaining QCD4 is the 2, 0 superconformal theory in six dimensions realized on N parallel coinciding M5branes, which was discussed in section 6.1.The compactification of this theory on a circle of radius R1 gives a fivedimensional theory whose lowenergy effective theory is the maximally supersymmetric SUN gaugetheory, with a gauge coupling constant g25  2R1. To obtain QCD4, one compactifiesthis theory further on another S1 of radius R0. The dimensionless gauge coupling constant g4 in four dimensions is given by g24  g252R0  R1R0. As in the previouscase, to break supersymmetry one imposes the antiperiodic boundary condition on thefermions around the second S1. And, as in the previous case, to really get QCD4 weneed to require that the typical mass scale of QCD states, QCD, will be much smallerthan the other mass scales in our construction 1R1 and 1R0, and this will requiregoing beyond the supergravity approximation. However, one can hope that the theoryobtained from the supergravity limit will be in the same universality class as QCD4,and we will give some evidence for this.As discussed in section 6.1, the large N limit of the sixdimensional theory is Mtheory on AdS7  S4. Upon compactification on the two circles and imposing antiperiodic boundary conditions for the fermions on the second S1, we get M theory ona black hole background 185. Taking the large N limit while keeping the t Hooftparameter 2  g24N finite requires R1  R0. We can now use the duality betweenM theory on a circle and Type IIA string theory, and the M5 brane wrapping on theS1 of radius R1 becomes a D4 brane. The large N limit of QCD4 then becomes TypeIIA string theory on the black hole geometry given by the metricds2 23u0u4u24i1dx2i 49u20u21 u60u6d 2  4du2u21 u60u6 d24 , 6.38with a non constant dilaton backgrounde2 83u327u30N2. 6.39204The coordinates xi, i  1, .., 4, parametrize the R4 gauge theory spacetime, the coordinate u0  u  , and  is an angular coordinate with period 2. The location ofthe horizon is at u  u0, which is related to the radius R0 of the compactifying circleasu0 13R0. 6.40Equivalently, we could have started with the five dimensional theory on the worldvolume of N D4 branes and heated it up to a finite temperature T  12R0. Indeed,the geometry 6.38 with the dilaton background 6.39 is the near horizon geometryof the nonextremal D4 brane background. But again, when we Wick rotate 6.38back to Lorentzian signature we take one of the coordinates xi as time. Notice thatthe string coupling 6.39 goes as 1N .ConfinementQCD4 at large distances is expected to confine with a linear potential V r  rbetween nonsinglet states. Therefore, the vacuum expectation value of the Wilsonloop operator is expected to exhibit an area law behavior. In order to see this in thedual description we follow the same procedure as in QCD3.The string tension  is given by the coefficient of the term4i1 dx2i in the metric6.38, evaluated at the horizon u  u0, times a12numerical factor  43u20 427R20. 6.41In QCD4 it is believed that confinement is a consequence of the condensation ofmagnetic monopoles via a dual Meissner effect. Such a mechanism has been shown tooccur in supersymmetric gauge theories in four dimensions 679. This has also beendemonstrated to some extent on the lattice via the implementation of the t HooftAbelian Projection 680. We will now see that this appears to be the mechanism alsoin the dual string theory description 293.Consider the five dimensional theory on the world volume of the D4 branes. Amagnetic monopole is realized as a D2 brane ending on the D4 brane 165. It isa string in five dimensions. Upon compactification on a circle, the four dimensionalmonopole is obtained by wrapping the string on the circle. We can now computethe potential between a monopole and antimonopole. This amounts to computing theaction of a D2brane interpolating between the monopole and the antimonopole, whichmediates the force between them as in figure 6.6a. This is the electricmagnetic dualof the computation of the quarkantiquark potential described above.If the pair is separated by a distance L in the x1 direction, and stretches along thex2 direction which we can interpret as the Euclidean time, the D2 brane coordinates205are , x1, x2. The action per unit length in the x2 direction is given byV 12232 L0ddx1edetG , 6.42where G is the induced metric on the D2 brane worldvolume. We have to find aconfiguration of the D2brane that minimizes 6.42. For L  Lc where up to anumerical constant Lc  R0, there is no minimal volume D2 brane configurationthat connects the monopole and the antimonopole and the energetically favorableconfiguration is as in figure 6.6b. Therefore there is no force between the monopoleand the antimonopole, which means that the magnetic charge is screened. At lengthscales L  R0 we expect pure QCD4 as the effective description. We see that in thisregion confinement is accompanied by monopole condensation, as we expect.uxD2 cc 112L  Lc Lc L abFigure 6.6 The magnetic monopole is a string in five dimensions and the four dimensional monopole is obtained by wrapping the string on the circle. The potentialbetween a monopole wrapped on c1 and an antimonopole wrapped in the oppositeorientation on c2, separated by a distance L in the x1 direction, amounts to computingthe action of a D2brane which mediates the force between them as in figure a. ForL  Lc there is no minimal volume D2 brane configuration that connects the monopoleand the antimonopole and the energetically favorable configuration is as in figure b,and then the magnetic charge is screened.206 VacuaIn addition to the gauge coupling, four dimensional gauge theories have an additionalparameter  which is the coefficient of the TrF  F  term in the Lagrangian. The angle dependence of asymptotically free gauge theories captures non trivial dynamicalinformation about the theory. Unlike in spontaneously broken gauge theories, it cannotbe analyzed by an instanton expansion. What is required is an appropriate effectivedescription of the theories at long wavelengths. Such an effective description is providedby the lattice. However, since the Lorentz invariance is lost by the discretization ofspace time, it is very difficult to study questions such as the behavior of the systemunder     2. Also, the construction of instantons which are the relevant objectsin the analysis of the  dependence is a rather non trivial task and involves delicatecooling techniques.Another effective description may be provided by the description of the four dimensional gauge theories by the M5 brane wrapping a non supersymmetric cycle. Indeed,in this formalism, one sees that the vacuum energy exhibits the correct  angle behaviorin softly broken supersymmetric gauge theories 681.In this subsection we use the dual string theory description to analyze the  angledependence in large N SUN gauge theory 682. Since the amplitude for an instantonis weighted by a factor exp82N where  is the t Hooft parameter which wekeep fixed, it naively seems that the instanton effects vanish as N  . However,unlike the N  4 gauge theory for instance, here one expects this not to be the casedue to IR divergences in the theory.Let us first review what we expect the behavior of the  dependence to be from thefield theory viewpoint. The YangMills action isIYM d4xTrN4F 2 162FF  . 6.43At large N we expect the energy of the vacuum to behave like E  N2CN. TheN2 factor is due to the fact that this is the order of the number of degrees of freedomthis also follows from the standard scaling of the leading diagrams in the t Hooftlimit. The dependence on N follows from 6.43 as is implied by the large N limit. is chosen to be periodic with period 2. Since the physics should not change under    2 we require that E  2  E.These conditions cannot be satisfied by a smooth function of N . They can besatisfied by a multibranched function with the interpretation that there are N inequivalent vacua, and all of them are stable in the large N limit. The vacuum energy isthen given by a minimization of the energy of the kth vacuum Ek with respect to kE  minkEk  N2 minkC  2kN , 6.44207for some function C which is quadratic in  for small values of .E 22Figure 6.7 The energy of the vacuum is expected to be a multibranched function.The function E is periodic in  and jumps at some values of  between differentbranches. The CP transformation acts by    and is a symmetry only for   0, .Therefore, C  C. One expects an absolute minimum at   0 and a nonvanishing of the second derivative of E with respect to , which corresponds to thetopological susceptibility t of the system as we will discuss later. Taking all thesefacts into account one conjectures in the leading order in 1N that 683E  tmink  2k2 O1N , 6.45where t is positive and independent of N . At    the function exhibits the jumpbetween the vacua at k  0 and k  1 and the spontaneous breaking of CP invariance.In order to analyze the  dependence in the dual string theory description with thebackground 6.38 we have to identify the  parameter. This is done by recalling thatthe effective Lagrangian of N D4 branes in Type IIA string theory has the coupling1162d5xATrFF , 6.46where A is the Type IIA RR 1form and F is the UN gauge field strength on thefive dimensional brane worldvolume. Upon compactification of the D4 brane theory ona circle we see that the four dimensional  parameter is related to the integral of theRR 1form on the circle. Since it is a ten dimensional field it is a parameter from theworldvolume point of view.In the dual description we define the parameters at infinite u. The  parameter isdefined as the integral of the RR 1form component on the circle at infinite u dA  2A , 6.47which is defined modulo 2k, k  Z.208The action for the RR 1form takes the formI 12210d10xg14ggA  AA  A , 6.48and the equation of motion for A isgggA  A  0 . 6.49The required solution A u to 6.49, regular at u  u0 and with vanishing fieldstrength at infinite u in order to have finite energy, takes the formA u  A 1u60u6 . 6.50Evaluating the Type IIA action for the RR 1form 6.48 with the solution 6.50 andrecalling the 2Z ambiguity we get the vacuum energy 6.45 where t is independentof N 682.In order to check that the vacua labeled by k are all stable in the limit N   weneed a way to estimate their lifetime. The domain wall separating two adjacent vacuais constructed by wrapping a D6 brane of Type IIA string theory on the S4 part of themetric 682. Since the energy density of the brane at weak coupling is of order 1gswhere gs is the Type IIA string coupling, as N   with fixed gsN it is of order N .If we assume a mechanism for the decay of a kth vacuum via a D6 brane bubble, itsdecay rate is of the order of eN . Thus, there is an infinite number of stable vacua inthe infinite N limit.One can repeat the discussion of confinement in the previous subsection for  6 0.When   2pq with coprime integers p, q the confinement is associated with acondensation of p, q dyons and realizes the mechanism of oblique confinement.Mass SpectrumThe analysis of the mass spectrum of QCD4 as seen by the dual description in thesupergravity limit is similar to the one we carried out for QCD3. It is illuminating toconsider an analogous picture of strong coupling lattice QCD 293.In strong coupling lattice QCD the masses of the lightest glueballs are of order 1awhere a is the lattice spacing. The reasoning is that in strong coupling lattice QCDthe leading contribution to the correlator of two Wilson loops separated by distance Lis from a tube with the size of one plaquette, as in figure 6.8, that connects the loops.With the Wilson lattice action the 0 glueball mass is given by 684M0  4 logg24Na1 . 6.51209aLFigure 6.8 The leading contribution in strong coupling lattice QCD to the correlatorof two Wilson loops, separated by distance L, is from a tube with the size of oneplaquette that connects the loops. This leads to the lowest mass glueballs having amass of the order of 1a, where a is the lattice spacing.To make the connection with continuum QCD4 we would like to sum the latticestrong coupling expansion M0  F g24Na1, and take the limit a  0 and g4  0withg24N 1blog1aQCDas a 0 , 6.52where g4 is the four dimensional coupling and b is the first coefficient of the function.We hope that in the limit 6.52 we will get a finite glueball mass measured in QCDunits.In the dual string theory description the analog of a is R0. The strong couplingexpansion is analogous to the  expansion of string theory. Supergravity is the leadingcontribution in this expansion. The lowest glueball masses Mg correspond to the zeromodes of the string, and their mass is proportional to 1R0. Another way to see thatthis limit resembles the strong coupling lattice QCD picture is to consider the Wilsonloop correlation function W C1W C2 as in figure 6.9a.For L  Lc, where L is the distance between the loops and Lc is determined by thesize of the loops, there is no stable string worldsheet configuration connecting the twoloops, as in figure 6.9b. The string worldsheet that connects the loops as in figure6.10a collapses and the two disks are now connected by a tube of string scale size asin figure 6.10b, resembling the strong coupling lattice QCD picture. The correlationfunction is then mediated by a supergraviton exchange between the disks. Thus, thesupergravitons are identified with the glueball states and the lowest glueball masses210turn out to be proportional to 1R0 293.uuxuccccL  L02121cbaL  LcFigure 6.9 The Wilson loop correlation function in figure a is computed by minimization of the string worldsheet that interpolates between them. When the distancebetween the loops L is larger than Lc there is no stable string worldsheet configurationconnecting the two loops as in figure b.As in strong coupling lattice QCD, to make the connection with the actual QCD4theory we need to sum the strong coupling expansion Mg  F g24NR0 and take thelimit of R0  0 and g4  0 withg24N 1blog1R0QCDas R0  0 . 6.53Again, we hope that in the limit 6.53 we will get a finite glueball mass proportionalto QCD.In the limit 6.53 the background 6.38 is singular. Thus, to work at large N inthis limit we need the full tree level string theory description and not just the SUGRAlimit. The supergravity description will provide us with information analogous tothat of strong coupling lattice QCD with a finite cutoff. However, since as discussedbefore the regularization here is done via a higher dimensional theory, we will have theadvantage of a full Lorentz invariant description in four dimensions. What we shouldbe worried about is whether we capture the physics of the higher dimensions as wellwhich from the point of view of QCD4 correspond to additional charged fields.In order to compute the mass gap we consider the scalar glueball 0. The 0glueball mass spectrum is obtained by solving the supergravity equation for any mode211L  LcL  Lcsupergravitona Cb CCC1122Figure 6.10 The string worldsheet that connects the loops in figure a collapses andthe two disks are now connected by a tube of a string scale as in figure b. Thecorrelation function is mediated by a supergraviton exchange between the disks andthe supergravitons are identified with the glueball states.f that couples to 0 glueball operators we expect and this is verified by the calculation that the lightest glueball will come from a mode that couples to the operatorTrF 2. There are several steps to be taken in order to identify this mode and itssupergravity equation. First, we consider small fluctuations of the supergravity fieldson the background 6.38, 6.39. The subtlety that arises is the need to disentanglethe mixing between the dilaton field and the volume factor which has been done in685. One then plugs the appropriate diagonal combinations of these fields into thesupergravity equations of motion. The fieldoperator identification can then be doneby considering the BornInfeld action of the D4 brane in the gravitational background.To compute the lowest mass modes we consider solutions of the form f  fueikxwhich satisfy the equation1u3uuu6  u60ufu M2fu  0 . 6.54The eigenvalues M2 are the glueball masses. The required solutions are normalizableand regular at the horizon. The eigenvalues M2 can be determined numerically 685or approximately via WKB techniques 675.As in QCD3 one finds thati There are no solutions with eigenvalues M2  0.ii There is a discrete set of eigenvalues M2  0.This exhibits the mass gap property of the supergravity picture.212The 0 mass spectrum in the WKB approximation closely agrees with the moreaccurate numerical solution. It takes the formM2  0.74nn 2R20, n  1, 2, 3,    . 6.55As in QCD3, the ratios of the glueball excited state masses with n  1 in 6.55 and thelowest mass n  1 state are in good agreement with the available lattice computations685, 672.As another example consider the 0 glueballs. The lowest dimension operator withthese quantum numbers is TrFF . As we discussed previously, on the D4 braneworldvolume it couples to the RR 1form A 6.46. Its equation of motion is given by6.49. We look for solutions of the form A  f ueikx. Plugging this into 6.49 weget1u5u6  u60uu7uf u  u4M2f u  0 . 6.56As for the 0 glueball states, the ratios of the 0 glueball masses are found to be ingood agreement with the lattice computations 685.Finally, we note that the ratio of the lowest masses 0 and 0 glueball states 685M0M0supergravity 1.20,M0M0lattice 1.36 0.32 , 6.57agrees with the lattice results too. Similar types of agreements in mass spectrumcomputations were claimed in strong coupling lattice QCD 686. However, note thatas discussed above for QCD3 other ratios, such as the ratio of the glueball masses tothe square root of the string tension, are very different in the SUGRA limit from theresults in QCD.The computation of the mass gap in the dual supergravity picture is in the oppositelimit to QCD. As in the supergravity description of QCD3, also here the KaluzaKleinmodes do not decouple. In this approach, in order to perform the computation in theQCD regime we need to use string theory. The surprising agreement of certain massratios with the lattice results may be a coincidence. Optimistically, it may have anunderlying dynamical reason.ConfinementDeconfinement TransitionWe will now put the above four dimensional QCDlike theory at a finite temperatureT which should not be confused with 12R0. We will see that there is a deconfinementtransition. In order to consider the theory at finite temperature we go to Euclidean213space and we compactify the time direction tE on a circle of radius  with antiperiodicfermion boundary conditions. Since we already had one circle labeled by  in 6.38,we now have two circles with antiperiodic boundary conditions. So, we can haveseveral possible gravity solutions. One is the original extremal D4 brane, anotheris the solution 6.38 and a third one is the same solution 6.38 but with  andtE interchanged. These last two solutions are possible only when the fermions haveantiperiodic boundary conditions on the corresponding circles. One of the last twosolutions always has lower free energy than the first, so we concentrate on these lasttwo.It turns out that the initial solution 6.38 has the lowest free energy for low temperatures, when   1T  2R0, while the one with   tE has the lowest freeenergy for   1T  2R0 high temperatures. The entropy of these two solutionsis very different, and therefore there is a first order phase transition, in complete analogy with the discussion in section 3.6. We do not know of a proof that there are noother solutions, but these two solutions have different topological properties, so therecannot be a smoothly interpolating solution. In any case, for very low and very hightemperatures they are expected to be the dominant configurations see 6635. Theentropy of the the high temperature phase is of order N2, while the entropy of the lowtemperature phase is essentially zero since the number of states in the gravity pictureis independent of the Newton constant.If we compute the potential between a quark and an antiquark then in the lowtemperature phase it grows linearly, so that we have confinement, while in the hightemperature phase the strings coming from the external quarks can end on the horizon,so that the potential vanishes beyond a certain separation. Thus, this is a confinementdeconfinement transition. It might seem a bit surprising at first sight that essentiallythe same solution can be interpreted as a confined and a deconfined phase at the sametime. The point it that quark worldlines are timelike, therefore they select one ofthe two circles, and the physical properties depend crucially on whether this circle iscontractible or not in the full tendimensional geometry.Other Dynamical AspectsIn this subsection we comment on various aspects of QCD4 as seen by the stringdescription. We first show how the baryons appear in the dual string theory M theorypicture. We will then compute other properties of the QCD vacuum, the topologicalsusceptibility and the gluon condensate, as seen in the dual description.Baryons5There are other singular solutions 620, but the general philosophy is that we do not allow singularsolutions unless we can give a physical interpretation for the singularity.214The baryon is an SUN singlet bound state of N quarks. Since we do not havequarks in our theory, we need to put in external quarks as described in section 3.5,and then there is a baryon operator coupling N external quarks. As in the conformalcase, also here it can be constructed as N open strings that end on a D4 brane that iswrapped on S4 293, 216, as in figure 6.11. If we view this geometry as arising fromMtheory, then the strings are M2 branes wrapping the circle with periodic fermionboundary conditions and the D4 brane is an M5 fivebrane also wrapping this circle.Then, N M2 branes can end on this M5 brane as in 216. There is a very similarpicture of a baryon in strong coupling lattice QCD as is depicted in figure 6.12, wherequarks are connected by flux links to a vertex.qq1uu0uxNFigure 6.11 The baryon is an SUN singlet bound state ofN quarks. It is constructedas N open strings that join together at a point in the bulk AdS black hole geometry.Several aspects of baryon physics can be seen from the string picture of figure 6.11216, 293. The baryon energy is proportional to the string tension 6.41 and in thelimit of large distances between the quarks to the sum of the distances between the Nquark locations and the location of the baryon vertex in the four dimensional xspace293, 392, 393. There is some subtlety in evaluating the baryon energy, and it wasclarified in 394 in the case of N  4 gauge theory. See also 395, 399. We mayconsider the baryon vertex as a fixed nondynamical point in the Born Oppenheimerapproximation. In such an approximation, the N quarks move independently in thepotential due to the string stretched between them and the vertex. The baryon massspectrum can be computed by solving the one body problem of the quark in thispotential. Corrections to this spectrum can be computed by taking into account thepotential between the quarks and the dynamics of the vertex. A similar analysis hasbeen carried out in the flux tube model 687 based on the Hamiltonian strong coupling215Figure 6.12 A baryon state in strong coupling lattice QCD. The quarks located atlattice sites are connected by flux links to a vertex. A similar picture is obtained byprojecting the baryon vertex in figure 6.11 on x space.lattice formulation 688.In a confining theory we do not expect to see a baryonic configuration made fromk  N quarks. This follows for the above description. If we want to separate a quarkwe will be left with a string running to infinity, which has infinite energy.Topological SusceptibilityThe topological susceptibility t measures the fluctuations of the topological chargeof the QCD vacuum. It is defined byt 11622d4xTrFF xTrFF 0 . 6.58At large N the WittenVeneziano formula 689, 690 relates the mass m in SUNYangMills gauge theory with Nf quarks to the topological susceptibility of SUNYangMills theory without quarksm2 4Nff 2t . 6.59Equation 6.59 is applicable at large N where f 2  N . In this limit m goes to zeroand we have the    degeneracy.Nevertheless, plugging the phenomenological valuesNf  3, N  3, m  1GeV, f 0.1 GeV in 6.59 leads to a prediction t  180 MeV 4, which is in surprising agreement with the lattice simulation for a finite number of colors 691.Evaluating the 2point function from the type IIA SUGRA action for the RR 1form2166.48 with the solution 6.50, we get the topological susceptibilityt 237293R40. 6.60The supergravity result 6.60 depends on two parameters,  and R0. This is theleading asymptotic behavior in 1 of the full string theory expression t  F R04.We would have liked to compute F , take the limit 6.53 and compare to the latticeQCD result. However, this goes beyond the currently available calculational tools.It may be instructive, though, to consider the following comparison. Let us assumethat there is a crossover between the supergravity description and the continuumQCD description. We can estimate the crossover point. In perturbative QCD we findF   e1211, therefore the crossover point to the F  34 behavior of 6.60can be estimated to be at   1211. Also, since the mass scale in the QCD regime isQCD, at the crossover point T  12R0  QCD  200 MeV . Of course, we shouldbear in mind that at the crossover point both the supergravity and perturbative QCDare not applicable descriptions. If we compare the topological susceptibility 6.60 atthe correspondence point with the lattice result we getSUGRAtLatticet14 1.7 . 6.61It may be an encouraging sign that the number we get is of order one, though its levelof agreement is not as good as the mass ratios of the glueball spectrum.Gluon CondensationThe gluon condensate  14g24TrF 20 is related by the trace anomaly to the energydensity T of the QCD vacuum. In the supergravity picture the one point function ofan operator corresponds to the first variation of the supergravity action. This quantityis expected to vanish by the equations of motion. However, the first variation is onlyrequired to vanish up to a total derivative term. Since asymptotically antide Sitterspace has a timelike boundary at infinity, there is a possible boundary contribution.Indeed, unlike the N  4 case, the one point function of the TrF 2 operator in thedual string theory description of QCD does not vanish.It can be computed either directly or by using the relation between the thermalpartition function and the free energy ZT   expFT . This relates the freeenergy associated with the string theory supergravity background to the expectationvalue of the operator TrF 2. One gets 685 14g24TrF 20 18N22 . 6.62217The relation 6.62 between the gluon condensate and the string tension is rathergeneral and applies for other regular backgrounds that are possible candidates for adual description 692.If we attempt again a numerical comparison with the lattice computation 693, 694we find at the crossover pointGluon condensateSUGRAGluon condensateLattice14 0.9 . 6.63We should note that in field theory the gluon condensate is divergent, and there aresubtleties which are not completely settled as to the relation between the latticeregularized result and the actual property of the QCD vacuum.Finally, for completeness of the numerical status, we note that if we compare thestring tension 6.41 at the crossover point and the lattice result we getQCD string tensionSUGRAQCD string tensionLattice12 2 . 6.646.2.3 Other DirectionsIn this subsection we briefly review other possible ways of describing non supersymmetric asymptotically free gauge theories via a dual string description. Additionalpossibilities are described in section 4.3.Different Background MetricsThe string models dual to QCDp that we studied exhibit the required qualitative properties, such as confinement, a mass gap and the  dependence of the vacuum energy,already in the supergravity approximation. We noted that besides the glueball massspectrum there exists a spectrum of KaluzaKlein modes at the same mass scale. Thisindicates that the physics of the higher dimensions is not decoupling from the fourdimensional physics6. The KaluzaKlein states did not decouple upon the inclusionof the 3 correction, but one hopes that they do decouple in the full string theoryframework. In the following we discuss an approach to removing some of them alreadyat the supergravity level. It should be stressed, however, that this does not solve theissue of a possible mixing between the glueball states and states that correspond tothe scalar and fermion fields, which for large  are at the same mass scale in the fieldtheory.6From the field theory point of view it indicates that SU4charged fields and KK modes of fivedimensional fields contribute in addition to the four dimensional gluons.218Again, the analogy with lattice gauge theory is useful. It is well known in the latticeframework that the action one starts with has a significant effect on the speed at whichone gets to the continuum limit. One can add to the lattice action deformations whichare irrelevant in the continuum limit and arrive at an appropriate effective descriptionof the continuum theory while having a larger lattice spacing. Such actions are calledimproved actions.A similar strategy in the dual supergravity description amounts to a modification ofthe background metric. The requirement is that the modification will better capture theeffective description of the gauge theory while still having a finite cutoff correspondingto finite  in our case. On the lattice a criterion for improvement is Lorentz invariance.Here, since the cutoff is provided by a higher dimensional theory we have the fullLorentz invariance in any case. The improvement will be measured by the removalof the KaluzaKlein modes. Note that we are attempting at an improvement in thestrong coupling regime. Such ideas have only now begun to be explored on the lattice695. Till now, the effort of lattice computations was directed at the computation ofthe strong coupling expansion series.Models that generalize the above background by the realization of the gauge theorieson nonextremal rotating branes have been studied in 696, 692, 320. The deformationof the background is parametrized by the angular momentum parameter. KaluzaKlein modes associated with the circle have the form   fueikxein , n  0. It hasbeen shown that as one varies the angular momentum one decouples these KaluzaKleinmodes, while maintaining the stability of the glueball mass spectrum. This deformationis not sufficient to decouple also the KaluzaKlein modes associated with the spherepart of the metrics 6.22 and 6.38, so we are still quite far from QCD.The number of nonsingular backgrounds is limited by the no hair theorem. Onemay consider more angular momenta, for instance. However, this does not seem tobe sufficient to decouple all the KaluzaKlein states 697, 698. It is possible thatwe will need to appeal to non regular backgrounds in order to fully decouple thehigher dimensional physics. Some non supersymmetric singular backgrounds of TypeII supergravity that exhibit confinement were constructed and discussed in 421, 422,423, 426.Type 0 String TheoryThe Type 0 string theories have worldsheet supersymmetry but no spacetime supersymmetry as a consequence of a nonchiral GSO projection 699, 700. Consider twotypes of such string theories, Type 0A and Type 0B. They do not have spacetimefermions in their spectra. Nevertheless, they have a modular invariant partition function. The bosonic fields of these theories are like those of the supersymmetric Type219IIA and Type IIB string theories, with a doubled set of RamondRamond fields. Type0 string theories can be formally viewed as the high temperature limit of the Type IIstring theories. They contain a tachyon field T .Type 0 theories have Dbranes. As in the Type II case, we can consider the gaugetheories on the worldvolume of N such branes. These theories do not contain an openstring tachyon. Moreover, the usual condensation of the tachyon could be avoided inthe near horizon region as we explain below.One particular example studied in 701 is the theory on N flat D3 branes in Type0B theory. Since there is a doubled set of RR 4form fields in Type 0B string theory,the D3 branes can carry two charges, electric and magnetic. The worldvolume theorytheory of N flat electric D3 branes is a UN gauge theory with six scalars in theadjoint representation of the gauge group. There are no fermionic fields. The classicalaction is derived by a dimensional reduction of the pure SUN gauge theory actionin ten dimensions. The six scalars are the components of the gauge fields in the reduced dimensions. The classical theory has an SO6 global symmetry that rotatesthe six scalars. This allows several possible parameters from the point of view ofrenormalizable field theory  a gauge coupling gYM , a mass parameter for the scalarsm and various scalar quartic potential couplings gi, one of which appears in the classical Lagrangian. In the classical worldvolume action, the mass parameter is zero andthe gi are fixed in terms of gYM , it is just the dimensional reduction of the ten dimensional bosonic YangMills theory. Quantum mechanically, the parameters are correcteddifferently and can take independent values. The theory has a phase diagram depending on these parameters. Generically we expect to see in the diagram CoulomblikeHiggs phases, confinement phases and maybe non trivial RG fixed points arising fromparticular tunings of the parameters.As in the case of D branes in Type II theories, one can conjecture here that thelowenergy theory on the electric D3 branes has a dual non supersymmetric stringdescription. At first sight this should involve a solution of AdS5 S5 type. The closedstring tachyon might be allowed in AdS if the curvature is of the order of the stringscale, since in that case the tachyon would obey the BreitenlohnerFreedman bound2.42. The fact that the curvatures are of the order of the string scale renders thegravity analysis invalid. In principle we should solve the worldsheet string theory. Sincewe do not know how to do that at present we can just do a gravity analysis and hopethat the full string theory analysis will give similar results. It was observed in 701that the tachyon potential includes the terms12m2e2T 2  F21  T  T22, 6.65where F is the electric RR five form field strength the magnetic one couples in a similarway but with T  T . The fact that the RR fields contribute positively to the mass220allows curvatures which, numerically, are a bit less than the string scale. Furthermore,it has been noticed in 702 that the first string correction to this background seemsto vanish. These conditions on the curvature translate into the condition gsN  O1which is precisely what we expect to get in QCD.An interesting feature is that, due to the potential 6.65 the tachyon would havea nonzero expectation value and that induces a variation of the dilaton field  in theradial coordinate via the equation 675, 7022  18m2e2T 2, m2   2. 6.66Since the radial coordinate is associated with the energy scale of the gauge theory,this variation may be interpreted as the flow of the coupling. In the UV large radialcoordinate the tachyon is constant and one finds a metric of the form AdS5S5. Thisindicates a UV fixed point. The coupling vanishes at the UV fixed point, and thismakes the curvature of the gravity solution infinite in the UV, but that is preciselywhat is expected since the field theory is UV free. The running of the coupling islogarithmic, though it goes like 1logE2. However, the quarkantiquark potentialgoes as 1 logE due to the square root in 3.95.In the IR small radial coordinate the tachyon vanishes and one finds again a solutionof the form AdS5S5. In the IR the coupling is infinite. Therefore this solution seemsto exhibit a strong coupling IR fixed point. However, since the dilaton is large, classicalstring theory is not sufficient to study the fixed point theory. The gravity solution atall energy scales u has not been constructed yet.Generically one expects the gauge theory to have different phases parametrized bythe possible couplings. The IR fixed point should occur as a particular tuning of thecouplings. Indeed, other solutions at small radial coordinate were constructed in 703that exhibit confinement and a mass gap. Moreover they were argued to be moregeneric than the IR fixed point solution.It was pointed out in 704 that the theories on the D3 branes of Type 0B stringtheory are particular examples of the orbifold models of N  4 theory that we studiedin section 4.1.1. The Rsymmetry of N  4 theory is SU4, the spin cover of SO6.It has a center Z4 and one can orbifold with respect to it or its subgroups . Thetheory on N flat electric D3 branes arises when the action of  on the ChanPatoncolor indices is in a trivial representation. This orbifold is not in the class of regularrepresentations which we discussed in section 4.1.1 in particular, in this case the betafunction does not vanish in the planar diagram limit. If we study instead the theoryarising on N selfdual D3branes of type 0 which may be viewed as bound states ofelectric and magnetic D3branes we find a theory which is in the class of regularrepresentation orbifolds 705, and behaves similarly to type II D3branes in the largeN limit. We will not discuss this theory here.221As with the D branes in Type II string theory, we can construct a large number of nonsupersymmetric models in Type 0 theories by placing the D branes at singularities. Oneexample is the theory of D3 branes of Type 0B string theory at a conifold singularity.As discussed in section 4.1.3, when placing N D3 branes of Type IIB string theoryat a conifold the resulting lowenergy worldvolume theory is N  1 supersymmetricSUN SUN gauge theory with chiral superfields Ak, k  1, 2 transforming in theN, N representation and Bl, l  1, 2 transforming in the N, N representation, andwith some superpotential.On the worldvolume of N electric D3 branes of Type 0B string theory at a conifoldthere is a truncation of the fermions and one gets an SUN  SUN gauge theorywith complex scalar fields Ak, k  1, 2 transforming in the N, N representation andBl, l  1, 2 transforming in the N, N representation. This theory at least if we set tozero the coefficient of the scalar potential which existed in the supersymmetric case isasymptotically free. The gravity description of this model has been analyzed in 706.In the UV one finds a solution of the form AdS5  T 1,1 which indicates a UV fixedpoint. The effective string coupling vanishes in accord with the UV freedom of thegauge theory. In the IR one finds again a solution of the form AdS5T 1,1 with infinitecoupling that points to a strong coupling IR fixed point. Of course, one expects thegauge theory to have different phases parametrized by the possible couplings. Indeed,there are other more generic solutions that exhibit confinement and a mass gap 706.Other works on dual descriptions of gauge theories via the Type 0 D branes are707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713.222Chapter 7Summary and DiscussionWe conclude by summarizing some of the successes and remaining open problems ofthe AdSCFT correspondence.From the field theory point of view we have learned and understood better manyproperties of the large N limit. Since t Hoofts work 3 we knew that the large N limitof gauge theories should be described by strings, if the parameter g2YMN is kept fixed.Through the correspondence we have learned that not only does this picture reallywork beyond perturbation theory where it was first derived, but that the YangMillsstrings made from gluons are the same as the fundamental strings. Moreover, thesestrings move in higher dimensions, as was argued in 47. These extra dimensionsarise dynamically in the gauge theory. For some field theories the curvatures in thehigher dimensional space could be small. The prototypical example is N  4 superYangMills with large N, g2YMN . From this example we can obtain others by takingquotients, placing branes at various singularities, etc. section 4.1. In all cases forwhich we can find a lowcurvature gravity description we can do numerous calculationsin the large N limit. We can calculate the spectrum of operators and states sections3.2, 3.4. We can calculate correlation functions of operators and of Wilson loopssections 3.3, 3.5. We can calculate thermal properties, like the equation of statesection 3.6, and so on.If the field theory is conformal the gravity solution will include an AdS factor. It ispossible, in principle, to deform the theory by any relevant operators. In some casesfairly explicit solutions have been found for flows between different conformal fieldtheories section 4.3. A ctheorem for field theories in more than two dimensionswas proven within the gravity approximation. It would be very interesting to generalizethis beyond this approximation. It would also be interesting to understand betterexactly what it is the class of field theories which have a gravity approximation. Oneconstraint on such four dimensional conformal field theories, described in section 3.2.2,is that they must have a  c.223It is possible to give a field theory interpretation to various branes that one can havein the AdS description section 4.2. Some correspond to baryons in the field theory,others to various defects like domain walls, etc. In the AdS5 case Dinstantons in thestring theory correspond to gauge theory instantons in the field theory.In general, the large N limit of a gauge theory should have a string theory description. Whether it also has a gravity description depends on how large the curvaturesin this string theory are. If the curvatures are small, we can have an approximateclassical gravity description. Otherwise, we should consider all string modes on thesame footing. This involves solving the worldsheet theories for strings in RamondRamond backgrounds. This is a problem that only now is beginning to be elucidated525, 714, 715, 716, 717, 718, 719, 720, 721. For nonsupersymmetric QCD, or othertheories which are weakly coupled as QCD is at high energies, we expect to havecurvatures at least of the order of the string scale, so that a proper understanding ofstrings on highly curved spaces seems crucial.It is also possible to deform the N  4 field theory, breaking supersymmetry andconformal invariance, by giving a mass to the fermions or by compactifying the theoryon a circle with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions. Then, we have a theorythat should describe pure YangMills theory at low energies sections 4.3, 3.6, 6.2. Inthe case of field theories compactified on a circle with supersymmetry breaking boundary conditions and large g2YMN at the compactification scale, one can show that thetheory is confining, has a mass gap, has vacua with the right qualitative propertiesand has a confinementdeconfinement transition at finite temperature. However, in theregime where the analysis can be done small curvature this theory includes manyadditional degrees of freedom beyond those in the standard bosonic YangMills theory. In order to do quantitative calculations in bosonic YangMills one would have todo calculations when the curvatures are large, which goes beyond the gravity approximation and requires understanding the propagation of strings in RamondRamondbackgrounds. Unfortunately, this is proving to be very difficult, and so far we have notobtained new results in QCD from the correspondence. As discussed in section 6.2,the gravity approximation resembles the strong coupling lattice QCD description 664,where the  expansion of string theory corresponds to the strong coupling expansion.The gravity description has an advantage over the strong coupling lattice QCD description by being fully Lorentz invariant. This allows, for instance, the analysis oftopological properties of the vacuum which is a difficult task in the lattice description.The AdSCFT correspondence does provide direct evidence that QCD is describableas some sort of string theory to the extent that we can use the name string theory forstrings propagating on spaces whose radius of curvature is of the order of the stringscale or smaller.One of the surprising things we learned about field theory is that there are various224new large N limits which had not been considered before. For instance, we can takeN   keeping gYM fixed, and the AdSCFT correspondence implies that manyproperties of the field theory like correlation functions of chiral primary operatorshave a reasonable limiting behavior in this limit, though there is no good field theoryargument for this. Similarly, we find that there exist large N limits for theories whichare not gauge theories, like the d  3,N  8 and d  6,N  2, 0 superconformalfield theories, and for various theories with less supersymmetry. The existence of theselimits cannot be derived directly in field theory.The correspondence has also been used to learn about the properties of field theorieswhich were previously only poorly understood. For instance, it has been used 343 tounderstand properties of two dimensional field theories with singular target spaces, andto learn properties of little string theories, like the fact that they have a Hagedornbehavior at high energies. The correspondence has also been used to construct manynew conformal field theories, both in the large N limit and at finite N .Another interesting case is topological ChernSimons theory in three dimensions,which is related to a topological string theory in six dimensions 329. In this case onecan solve exactly both sides of the correspondence and see explicitly that it works.The correspondence is also useful for studying nonconformal gauge theories, as wediscussed in section 6.1.3. A particularly interesting case is the maximally supersymmetric quantum mechanical SUN gauge theory, which is related to Matrix theory26, 722, 723, 647, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728, 729, 730.From the quantum gravity point of view we have now an explicit holographic description for gravity in many backgrounds involving an asymptotically AdS space. Thefield theory effectively sums over all geometries which are asymptotic to AdS. Thisdefines the theory nonperturbatively. This also implies that gravity in these spaces isunitary, giving the first explicit nonperturbative construction of a unitary theory ofquantum gravity,1 albeit in a curved space background. Black holes are some mixedstates in the field theory Hilbert space. Explicit microscopic calculations of black holeentropy and greybody factors can be done in the AdS3 case chapter 5.Basic properties of quantum gravity, such as approximate causality and locality atlow energies, are far from clear in this description 181, 279, 171, 179, 177, 731, 182,and it would be interesting to understand them better. We are also still far from havinga precise mapping between general configurations in the gravitational theory and inthe field theory see 732, 178 for some attempts to go in this direction.In principle one can extract the physics of quantum gravity in flat space by takingthe large radius limit of physics in AdS space. Since we have not discussed this yet1In the context of Matrix theory 26 we need to take a large N limit which is not well understoodin order to describe a theory of gravity in a space with no closed lightlike curves.225in the review, let us expand on this here, following 733, 734, 180, 735 see also 178,736, 737, 738. We would like to be able to describe processes in flat space whichoccur, for instance, at some fixed string coupling, with the energies and the size of theinteraction region kept fixed in string or Planck units. Computations on AdS spaceare necessarily done with some finite radius of curvature however, we can view thisradius of curvature as a regulator, and take it to infinity at the end of any calculation,in such a way that the local physics remains the same. Let us discuss what this meansfor the AdS5  S5 case the discussion is similar for other cases. We need to keep thestring coupling fixed, and take N   since the radius of curvature in Planck units isproportional to N14. Note that this is different from the t Hooft limit, and involvestaking  . In order to describe a scattering process in spacetime which has finiteenergies in this limit, it turns out that the energies in the field theory must scale asN14 measured in units of the scale of the S3 which the field theory is compactifiedon we need to work in global AdS coordinates to describe flatspace scattering. Inthis limit the field theory is very strongly coupled and the energies are also very high,and there are no known ways to do any computations on the field theory side. Itwould be interesting to compute anything explicitly in this limit. For example, itwould be interesting to compute the entropy of a small Schwarzschild black hole, muchsmaller than the radius of AdS, to see flatspace Hawking radiation, and so on. If westart with AdS5  S5 this limit gives us the physics in flat ten dimensional space, andsimilarly starting with AdS4  S7 or AdS7  S4 we can get the physics in flat elevendimensional space. It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence canbe used to learn about theories with lower dimension, where some of the dimensionsare compactified. A limit of string theory on AdS3  S3 M4 may be used to givestring theory on R5,1 M4, but it is not clear how to get four dimensional physics outof the correspondence.One could, in principle, get four dimensional flat space by starting from AdS2  S2compactifications. However, the correspondence in the case of AdS2 spaces is notwell understood. AdS2 spaces arise as the near horizon geometry of extremal chargedReissnerNordstrom black holes. Even though fields propagating in AdS2 behave similarly to the higher dimensional cases 739, the problem is that any finite energyexcitation seems to destroy the AdS2 boundary conditions 342. This is related tothe fact that black holes as opposed to black pbranes, p  0 have an energy gapsee section 5.7, so that in the extreme low energy limit we seem to have no excitations. One possibility is that the correspondence works only for the ground states.Even then, there are instantons that can lead to a fragmentation of the spacetime intoseveral pieces 740. Some conformal quantum mechanics systems that are, or couldbe, related to AdS2 were studied in 741, 742, 743, 729. Aspects of Hawking radiationin AdS2 were studied in 744.226In all the known cases of the correspondence the gravity solution has a timelikeboundary2. It would be interesting to understand how the correspondence works whenthe boundary is lightlike, as in Minkowski space. It seems that holography must workquite differently in these cases see 745, 746 for discussions of some of the issues involved. In the cases we understand, the asymptotic space close to the boundary hasa well defined notion of time, which is the one that is associated to the gauge theory. It would be interesting to understand how holography works in other spacetimes,where we do not have this notion of time. Interesting examples are spatially closeduniverses, expanding universes, deSitter spacetimes, etc. See 747, 748, 749, 750 forsome attempts in this direction. The precise meaning of holography in the cosmologicalcontext is still not clear 751, 752, 753, 754, 755, 756, 757.To summarize, the past 18 months have seen much progress in our understanding ofstringM theory compactifications on AdS and related spaces, and in our understanding of large N field theories. However, the correspondence is still far from realizing thehopes that it initially raised, and much work still remains to be done. The correspondence gives us implicit ways to describe QCD and related interesting field theories ina dual stringy description, but so far we are unable to do any explicit computationsin the field theories that we are really interested in. The main hope for progress inthis direction lies in a better understanding of string theory in RR backgrounds. Thecorrespondence also gives us an explicit example of a unitary and holographic theoryof quantum gravity. We hope this example can be used to better understand quantum gravity in flat space, where the issues of unitarity the information problemand holography are still quite obscure. Even better, one could hope that the correspondence would hint at a way to formulate stringM theory independently of thebackground. These questions will apparently have to wait until the next millennium.AcknowledgementsWe would like to thank T. Banks, M. Berkooz, A. Brandhuber, M. Douglas, D. Freedman, S. Giddings, D. Gross, G.
