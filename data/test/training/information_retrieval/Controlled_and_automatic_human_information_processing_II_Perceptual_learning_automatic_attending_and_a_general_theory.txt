Controlled and Automatic Human Information Processing
II. Perceptual Learning, Automatic Attending
and a General Theory

University of California, Berkeley
The two-process theory of detection, search, and attention presented by
Schneider and Shiffrin is tested and extended in a series of experiments. The
studies demonstrate the qualitative difference between two modes of informa
tion processing: automatic detection and controlled search. They trace the
course of the learning of automatic detection, of categories, and of automatic
attention responses. They show the dependence of automatic detection on at
tending responses and demonstrate how such responses interrupt controlled
processing and interfere with the focusing of attention. The learning of cat
egories is shown to improve controlled search performance. A general frame
work for human information processing is proposed; the framework emphasizes
the roles of automatic and controlled processing. The theory is compared to and
contrasted with extant models of search and attention
I. Introduction
In Part I of this paper (Schneider amp
Shiffrin, 1977) we reported the results of
several experiments on search and attention
that led us to formulate a theory of informa
tion processing based on two fundamental
processing modes: controlled and automatic
In the context of search studies, these modes
took the form of controlled search and auto
matic detection. Controlled search is highly
demanding of attentional capacity, is usually

rate, is easily established, altered, and even
reversed by the subject, and is strongly de
pendent on load. Automatic detection is rela
tively well learned in long-term memory, is
demanding of attention only when a target
is presented, is parallel in nature, is difficult
to alter, to ignore, or to suppress once learned
and is virtually unaffected by load
In the present article we shall report
several studies to elucidate further the proper
ties of automatic and controlled processing
and their interrelations, to demonstrate the
qualitative difference between these processing
modes, to study the development of automatic
detection and the role of the type and nature
of practice in such development, to study
the effects of categorization, and to examine
the development of automatic attending and
its effects. After the presentation of the
studies we shall present a general theory of
information processing, with emphasis on the

A. Review of Paradigms and Results From
Part I
The paradigm for most of the studies of
Part I (and Part II also) is depicted in
Figure 1. Four elements are presented simul
taneously in a square; and their joint presen
tation for a brief period of time is termed a
frame. Each trial consists of the presentation
of 20 frames in immediate succession. The
elements presented are characters (i.e., digits
or consonants) or random dot masks. In ad
vance of each trial the subject is presented
with several items, called the memory set, and
is then required to detect any memoryset
items that appear in the subsequent frames
The frame time is kept constant across the
20 frames of each trial, and the basic depen
dent variable is the psychometric function
relating accuracy to frame time for each
condition
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
Three basic independent variables were
manipulated in Part I/Experiment 1. The
number of characters in each frame the
frame size, F) was varied from 1 to 4 but
was constant for all frames of a given trial
The number of characters presented in ad
vance of a trial (the memory-set size, M
varied from 1 to 4. The product of M and F
is termed the load. A memory-set item that
appears in a frame is called a target; an
item in a frame that is not in the memory
set is called a distractor. One half of the trials
contained one target, and one half contained
no target. Finally, and most important, the
nature of the training procedure across trials
and the relation of the memory-set items to
the distractors were varied. In the consistent
mapping (CM) procedure, across all trials
memory-set items were never distractors and
vice versa). In addition, memory-set items
were from one category (e.g., digits) and
distractors from another category (e.g., con
sonants). In the varied mapping VM
procedure, memory-set items and distractors
were randomly intermixed over trials and
were all from one category (e.g., consonants
Figure 1 gives examples of trials in both
the VM and CM conditions. Depicted are
four consecutive trials from a CM block and
four from a VM block in each of which
M = 4 and F = 2. Table 1 gives the memory
set, distractor, and target (if present) for
each trial in Figure 1. Note that memoryset
items and distractors intermix across trials
in the VM condition but do not intermix over
trials in the CM condition
The most important results are shown in
Figure 2. These results showed that the VM
conditions were strongly affected by load and
were quite difficult; the CM conditions were
virtually unaffected by load and were all
easier than even the easiest VM condition
It was suggested that a controlled, serial
search was operating in the VM conditions
and that a qualitatively different process
automatic detection, was operating in the
CM conditions
The results of Part I/Experiment 1 were
analyzed on the basis of the accuracy of the
detection responses. Part I/Experiment
utilized comparable conditions but presented

only a single frame on each trial; accuracy
was high and the results were analyzed on
the basis of the reaction time of the responses
The results confirmed those of Part IExperi
ment 1, and a quantitative model was fit to
the VM results of both experiments. This
model assumed that controlled search was
a serial, terminating comparison process in
which one first compared all frame items
against one memory-set item before switching
to the next memory-set item. Each compari
son and each switch was assumed to require
some time to be executed. The success of the
model in fitting the results of both experi
ments suggests that the same search mech
anisms underlie search experiments that uti
lize both accuracy and reaction time mea
sures, and suggests that the same search
mechanisms underlie performance in both
divided-attention and search paradigms
The vast differences between results of the
CM and VM conditions provided a basis for
reorganizing and classifying the results of
previous search and detection studies. These
studies fell into a relatively simple organiza
tion, and many perplexing and seemingly
contradictory results became explicable
Part I/Experiment 3 utilized a multiple
target, multiple-frame procedure. The study
was similar to Part I/Experiment 1, but the
subject was presented either zero, one, or two
targets per trial and was required to report
the number of detected targets. The condi

dons of greatest interest were those in which
two targets per trial were presented. In these
cases the spacing between the two targets
varied from 0 to 4 (0 spacing indicates simul
taneous presentation; spacings of 1, 2, and
indicate the number of intervening frame
plus 1). Target similarity also varied, the
two targets being either physically identical
(II) or different NI
The results for Part I/Experiment
showed markedly different patterns for the
VM and CM conditions. Consider target
similarity first. In the VM conditions de
tection of identical targets (II) was superior
to detection of different targets (NI). How
ever, in the CM conditions, the reverse
was true: NI detection was superior to II
detection. Consider target spacing next. In
the VM conditions performance was lowest
when the targets occurred in successive frames
(spacing 1). However, in the CM conditions
performance was lowest when the targets were
simultaneous (spacing 0). These results
helped emphasize the qualitative difference
between the automatic detection processing
mode presumed to be utilized in the CM
conditions, and the controlled search mode
presumed to be utilized in the VM conditions
In certain of the studies in this paper, we
shall utilize this multiple-target, multiple
frame procedure and will infer the presence
of automatic detection or controlled search
from the nature of the spacing effect and the
target-similarity effect
B. Rationale for the Experiments
We argued in Part I that the cause of the
difference between the CM and VM results
was the consistency of the mapping over
trials) of the memory-set items and dis
tractors to responses. We argued that con
sistent mapping leads to the development of
automatic detection, which enables auto
matic-attention responses to become attached
to the memory-set items. The automaticat
tention responses enable the serial, controlled
search to be bypassed by a parallel detection
process unaffected by load. However, these
hypotheses must be further tested for the
following reasons. First, the fact that mem
ory-set items were categorically distinct
from the distractors was confounded with the
consistency of the mapping. These factors
will be separated in Part II/Experiments
2, and 3. Second, the course of development
of the hypothesized automatic detection
process was not studied in Part I. The course
of learning will be traced in Part IIExperi
ments 1 and 3. Third, there was no demon
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
stration in Part I that an automaticatten
tion response is learned in CM paradigms
Such a fact will be suggested by Part II
Experiments 1 to 3 and demonstrated in
Part II/Experiment 4. Finally, although these
goals provide an initial justification for the
present experiments, these studies will serve
an even more important purpose in elu
cidating the characteristics and development
of automatic processing and in differentiating
automatic from controlled processing
II. The Development of Automatic Processing
Perceptual Learning
A. Perceptual Learning and Unlearning in a
CM Task Using Letters Only
Experiment 1 of the present series is simple
in conception. With the use of the same basic
multiple-frame paradigm used in Part I
Experiment 1 (see Figure 1), performance is
examined as a function of the amount of
training under consistent-mapping conditions
One change is made, however: Both the dis
tractor set and the memory ensemble consist
of consonants. This procedure enables us to
study the acquisition of automaticity when
the two sets are not already-learned cate
gories. Furthermore, it had been observed
informally that the use of digits and con
sonants (in the CM conditions of Part I
Experiment 1) led to a relatively rapid
acquisition of automatic detection. It was
felt that the use of letters only to make up
the two sets would slow down acquisition
Values of M and F were chosen so as to
make controlled processing difficult (M =
F — 2 ) , and a frame time (/) of 200 msec
was chosen so as to make performance low
when controlled processing was being utilized
(These choices are justified by the data in
Figure 2.) Thus it was expected that per
formance would be quite poor at the start of
training, when automatic detection had not
been learned and controlled search had to be
used, but would improve markedly as auto
matic detection developed
I . Method
The CM presentation procedure of Part IExperi
ment 1 was utilized (see Figure 1). The frame size
was always equal to 2 and the memory-set size was
always equal to 4. Two disjoint character sets were
used for the memory ensemble and the distractor
set. One consisted of the following nine consonants
B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, and L; the other con
sisted of the following nine consonants: Q, R, S
T, V, W, X, Y, and Z
There were four new subjects, two of each sex
all naive to our tasks.1 Two subjects began training
with the consonants from the second half of the
alphabet 'as the memory ensemble, and two subjects
began with the consonants from the first half of
the alphabet as the memory ensemble. There were
five blocks of trials per session, each containing
60 test trials. There were no practice trials. Subjects
were informed at the start of the experiment con
cerning the nature of the study and the composi
tion of the memory ensemble and the distractor set
Each trial began with the presentation of a memory
set (M = 4) selected randomly from the memory
ensemble
During the first 1,500 trials of the experiment
for each subject, the frame time was 200 msec
during the following 600 trials, 120 msec. After
these 2,100 trials the memory ensemble and the
distractor set were switched for each subject and
the frame time was set back to 200 msec. This
reversal 'Condition was then run at the frame time
of 200 msec for a total of 2,400 additional trials. The
subjects were informed of the reversal at the time
of the switch
The subjects responded whenever a target was
detected, or gave a negative response at the end of
the trial. The accuracy of the response and the
reaction time for hits were both recorded. Sub
jects heard a tone signifying an error after each
incorrect response
2. Results and Discussion
The results are presented in Figure 3. Re
sults for each block, averaged across sub
jects, are graphed consecutively. Thus, the
graphed points in each interval are based on
120 observations
In the initial group of 1,500 trials, the hit
rate rose from just over 50% to about
while the false alarm rate dropped from
about 12% to about 3% (and the reaction

2,100 trials the target and distractor sets were switched with each other
time for hits dropped from about 770 msec
to about 670 msec
It seems plausible that the subjects adopted
a controlled search strategy at the start of
training. Some support for this hypothesis is
found in a comparison of the data from this
study with the data from Experiment 3 of
Part I (though different subjects were in
volved in the two studies). The hit and false
alarm probabilities in the first 60 trials of
the present study were .56 and .13, respec
tively. The estimated probability of detecting
a single target and the observed probability
of giving a false alarm when no target was
present were .60 and .18, respectively, in the
VM condition of Experiment 3b of Part I in
which M was equal to 4 and F was equal to
(this condition and the first 60 trials of the
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
present study were both run at a frame time
of 200 msec). These two conditions should
give similar results if controlled search is
being utilized in both studies; in fact, the
probabilities are quite similar
It should be noted that the subjects all re
ported extensive, attention-demanding re
hearsal of the memory set during about the
first 600 trials of Experiment 1, but they
gradually became unaware of rehearsal or
other attention-demanding controlled pro
cessing after this point. Both the objective
evidence and subjective reports, then, sug
gest that the subjects used controlled search
at the start of Experiment 1 but gradually
shifted to automatic detection
The hit rate and false alarm rate after
1,500 trials appeared to be changing only
slowly, but this could have resulted from a
ceiling effect. The frame time was therefore
reduced to 120 msec for the next 600 trials
At the conclusion of this additional training
the hit rate appears to have reached about
82%, while the false alarm rate dropped to
about 5%. These results may be compared
with the CM results from Experiment 1 of
Part I (see Figure 2 ) . In that study, with
/ = 120 msec, M - 4, and F = 2, the CM hit
rate was about 92% and the false alarm rate
(not shown) was about
Thus, the present results indicate that
subjects were utilizing automatic detection
by the end of the initial 2,100 trials of CM
training. First, they performed at a level not
far from that of the Part I/Experiment
subjects in the comparable CM condition
with the same frame time. Furthermore, the
present study utilized a larger memory en
semble and distractor set than the VM con
ditions of Part I/Experiment 1, a fact that
could only have increased the task difficulty
Second, from the Part I/Experiment 1 VM
data we can estimate that a frame time of
600-800 msec would have been required to
achieve a similar level of performance had
controlled search been used
At this stage of the experiment, after
trials of CM training, the subjects could be
expected to have developed a welllearned
attention response to the members of the
memory ensemble. If such learning is firmly
planted in long-term memory and if the at
tention response occurs automatically, then
it should prove very difficult for the subject
to alter or unlearn his automatic response in
any short period of time. To test this hy
pothesis we reversed the memory ensemble
and the distractor set for each subject and
set the frame time back to 200 msec). We
hypothesized that automatic detection would
prove impossible and that the subject would
be forced to revert to controlled search
The results of the reversal were quite
dramatic. The hit rate just after reversal
fell to a level well below that seen at the
start of training when the subjects were com
pletely unpracticed. Very gradually there
after the hit rate recovered, so that after
2,400 trials of reversal training, performance
reached a level about equal to that seen after
1,500 trials of original training. In summary
the original training resulted in quite strong
negative transfer, rather than positive
transfer
Subject's verbal reports indicated that a
shift back to controlled search occurred after
reversal. Initially, before reversal, all sub
jects reported rehearsing the memory set
during each trial. After the 2nd day
trials) subjects reported that they were no
longer rehearsing and only glanced at the
memory set. However, subjects reported that
after reversal they tried various methods to
perform the task and eventually ended up
rehearsing the memory-set items again, though
this rehearsal also decreased after a week of
postreversal practice. This pattern of re
ports could indicate a shift from controlled
search to automatic detection during original
learning, then a shift after reversal to con
trolled search, and then finally a return to
automatic detection
What might be the cause of the negative
transfer after reversal? If the reversal caused
subjects to revert to controlled search, then
it might have been expected that perform
ance would fall to the level seen at the start
of original learning (when controlled search
was presumably utilized). The actual results
suggest that controlled search is hindered
when the distractors are items that subjects
have been previously trained to respond to as
134 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
CM targets (i.e., items that, due to previous
training, give rise to automaticattention
responses). This hypothesis is verified in
Experiment 4, to be reported later
Beyond the poor performance at the start
of reversal learning, negative transfer is also
evidenced by the extremely large amount of
training needed to overcome the effects of orig
inal learning. After about 900 trials of original
practice the hit rate reached about
However, it took about 2,100 trials to return
to this performance level after reversal. Ap
parently the necessity to unlearn the at
tention responses to the previous memoryset
items, or the necessity to overcome some
learned inhibition to the previous distractors
or both, causes a reduction in the rate of
acquisition of automatic processing after
reversal
It would be interesting to know whether
negative transfer would obtain in several
variations of our paradigm. For example, in
the present study, the initial training might
have caused the memory set to become a
learned category, but probably did not cause
categorization of the distractor set. If the
distractor set was a well-known category
would reversal still cause a severe perform
ance drop? Furthermore, it could be argued
that the initial training did not continue long
enough for the negative transfer to reach full
strength. The amount of negative transfer
might depend on the amount of overtraining
during initial learning. Such a view has been
put forth for certain verbal and animal learn
ing situations (see Handler, 1962, S
Jung, 1965 for two views on the subject
Thus it might be asked whether performance
drops would be caused by reversal if the
original automatic detection responses were
greatly overlearned. These two questions are
answered by Experiment
B. The Reversal of Consonants and Digits
for Well-Practiced Subjects
Throughout the series of experiments in
Part I, the memory ensemble in the CM
condition was always the same, either digits
or consonants, and no member of the CM
memory ensemble was ever a distractor, even
in the VM conditions. The VM conditions
always consisted solely of items from the
distractor set in the CM conditions. Thus a
subject at the conclusion of the series of
Part I studies who had been searching, say
for consonants in digit distractors, had never
been given a consonant as a distractor
Whenever a consonant had appeared, it was
a target. These facts naturally suggested a
study in which the roles of consonants and
digits were reversed for these subjects
1. Method
The procedure was identical to the multiple
frame, multiple-target paradigm of Experiment a
of Part I (whose results were described in the
Introduction) in most respects, except that the
memory ensemble and the distractor set were
switched in both the CM and VM conditions. Thus
in the CM condition the two subjects who had
been searching for consonants in digit distractors
now searched for digits in consonant distractors
in the VM condition these two subjects had been
searching for digits in digits and now searched for
consonants in consonants. These contingencies were
reversed for the remaining two subjects who had
previously been searching for digits in consonant
distractors in their CM conditions
The frame time (/) was 60 msec for the CM
conditions and 200 msec for the VM conditions
Just as in Experiment 3 a of Part I, M was equal
to 2, and F was equal to 2 ; zero targets were pre
sented on one fourth of the trials, one target was
presented on one fourth of the trials and two
targets were presented on one half of the trials
When two targets were presented, they were either
identical (II) or nonidentical (NI), and the spac
ing between them was either 0, 1, 2, or 4. Each
subject was given 12 blocks of 132 trials in each
of the VM and CM conditions. The VM and CM
blocks alternated
Upon 'Completion of the initial set of 24 blocks
the frame time was increased to 120 msec and an
additional 18 blocks of CM trials were run for each
subject
2 One might hypothesize that the basic compari
son rate of controlled search is altered and slowed
after reversal, thereby accounting for the negative
transfer. Two facts argue against this hypothesis
Experiment 2 shows that controlled search proceeds
at an unchanged rate even when all items consist
of targets from previous CM conditions. Experiment
4 shows that even one CM target presented in a
to-be-ignored spatial location greatly reduces detec
tion of a simultaneously presented target in a tobe
attended location. This result suggests that reversal
performance is harmed because attention tends to
be drawn to the distractors
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
It should be noted that the subjects for this ex
periment had had roughly 20,000 trials of practice
in the various CM and VM conditions in earlier
studies (see Footnote
2. Results and Discussion
The results are depicted in Figure 4. A
simple correction for guesses and false alarms
has been carried out on the raw data, as
described in Part I, but this correction did
not affect the qualitative features of the re
sults. The circles in the left-hand panel give
the comparable VM prereversal data from
Experiment 3a of Part I ( /= 200 msec
while the circles in the center panel give the
comparable CM prereversal data from Ex
periment 3c of Part I (/ = ,60 msec); the
triangles in the two left-most panels give the
data from the present experiment (see Foot
note
The most dramatic findings of Experiment
2 are shown in the middle panel of Figure
which gives the CM reversal results. It is
evident that performance drops off markedly
after reversal. Estimated percentage of detec
tion of two targets is about 80% prior to
reversal and about 20% after reversal. Fur
thermore, these data represent 12 blocks of
training over which very little, if any, re
covery was taking place. It is interesting to
note that all of the subjects predicted that
no change in their performance would occur
after the consonants and digits were reversed
and the subjects were uniformly startled and
even dismayed by the extreme difficulty of
the reversed task
These results resolve the confounding be
tween categorization and the mapping condi
tions. Even when there is a well-learned and
well-practiced categorical difference between
memory ensemble and distractor set, reversal
in the CM paradigm gives rise to marked
impairment of performance. Thus, categorical
differences between memory ensemble and
distractor set cannot be the key factor under
lying the utilization of automatic detection
Rather it is the consistency of mapping that
underlies the acquisition of automatic detec
tion

the switch from consonants to digits or
vice versa for other subjects) had almost
no effect. The levels of performance remain
the same as in Experiment 3a of Part I, and
the qualitative pattern of results is still about
the same, showing the pattern indicative of
controlled search. That is, worst perform
ance occurred at spacing 1, and performance
was worst when the targets were different
(NI). These effects indicate the presence of
controlled search. In summary, a change of
the character set used in the VM conditions
had no appreciable effect under the present
conditions
These results are most interesting, be
cause after reversal the memory ensemble
and the distractor set both consisted of
items that had come to elicit automatic
attention responses in previous training. In
the reversal conditions of Experiment 1 we
saw that making the distractor set but not the
memory ensemble consist of such automatic
items resulted in considerable negative trans
fer. In the present experiment it is evident
that performance is not worse after reversal
when subjects have been trained to re
spond to both the targets and distractors in
previously CM training
These results might be expected on the
basis of the following reasoning. Just after
reversal in both Experiment 1 and in the CM
conditions of Experiment 2 the subjects were
using controlled search. In Experiment 1, after
reversal, the automatic-attention responses
to the distractor items tended to draw at
tention away from target items to which sub
jects had not previously been trained to re
spond and hence to order the controlled search
in such a way that the distractor items were
compared earlier in the search. Thus per
formance was impaired. (This hypothesis is
confirmed in Experiment 4.) However, in the
present experiment, after reversal, all items
distractors and targets alike, gave rise to
attention responses, which could be expected
to cancel each other out on the average
That is, there should be no selective bias to
compare distractors prior to targets since
both types of items give rise to equivalent
attention responses. Thus, the controlled
search operates normally, with targets com
pared in a random order of search, and per
formance is equivalent to that seen prior to
the switch of character sets
In short, the use in a search task of stimuli
that elicit automatic-attention responses de
veloped through previous CM training) can
(a) improve performance over that seen in
the usual VM conditions if these stimuli are
memory-set items but not distractors, in
which case automatic detection will be uti
lized; (b) leave performance unchanged
from that seen in the usual VM conditions if
these stimuli are both memory-set items and
distractor items, in which case normal con
trolled search will be utilized; and (c) im
pair performance from that seen in the usual
VM conditions if these stimuli are distractors
but not memory-set items, in which case
subjects will utilize controlled search that
will be reduced in effectiveness by automatic
attending to distractors
Let us now turn to the results of the final
reversed CM training blocks. We suspected
that the subjects in the reversed CM condi
tion (the middle panel) were reverting back
to the use of controlled search, but perform
ance levels were so low that it was difficult
to interpret the pattern of results. Thus
frame time in the CM reversal condition was
increased to 120 msec, and 18 blocks of addi
tional CM training were run
The results of the trials with / = 120 msec
are represented by the squares in the right
hand panel of Figure 4. It should be noted
first that the pattern of the results is in
dicative of controlled search in that the worst
performance occurs at spacing 1. However
the results do not show the targetsimilarity
effect that we have been led to expect in
Experiment 3 of Part I) for controlled search
Results for conditions using II target pairs
are not superior to those using NI target
pairs. Furthermore, the overall level of per
formance is higher than one would expect
for the VM conditions. At a frame time of
120 msec performance is higher than that
seen for the VM conditions at a frame time
of 200 msec (in the left-hand panel of Fig
ure
The results can be explained simply and
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
elegantly by the hypothesis that the sub
jects were carrying out a controlled search
for the category as a whole. The Experi
ment 2 reversal condition differed from the
Part I/Experiment 3 VM conditions in that
the memory-set items and the distractor
items in the present instance were cate
gorically different (numbers and letters
This categorical difference obviously did not
allow the subjects to utilize automatic detec
tion after reversal. However, the categorical
difference could very well have helped the
subjects to adopt a more efficient controlled
search. Suppose the subject ignored the
specific members of the memory set and
searched instead for any instance of the cate
gory "numbers" (or "letters" as the case
may be). Then only one comparison would
be needed for each display item in each
frame, regardless of memory-set size
Compared with the case when a categoriza
tion is unavailable, a controlled search for
the category of each input saves search time
in two ways. First, there is no need for mul
tiple memory-set comparisons for each frame
item. Second, there is no need for time
consuming switches between memoryset
items. Thus performance improves consider
ably. Furthermore, the distinction between
identical and nonidentical multiple targets is
no longer meaningful—both targets are sim
ply category members, regardless of their
physical similarity. Thus no difference be
tween the II and NI conditions would be
predicted. The results in Figure 4 support
these contentions
As far as we can tell, through a blockby
block analysis of the reversal results, the sub
jects did not begin to recover any appreciable
degree of automatic detection even after
blocks of CM reversal training. Undoubtedly
the difficulty in relearning (or unlearning
is related to the great amount of overtrain
ing with the original mapping of stimuli to
responses. Eventually, however, were the
reversal experiment continued, we would ex
pect automatic detection to develop once
again
In summary, then, the results of Experi
ment 2 show that a switch of character sets
does not affect VM performance, but a switch
of memory ensemble and distractor set causes
a great decrement in performance in the CM
conditions. The CM decrement occurs despite
the categorical difference between the mem
ory-set items and distractor items letters
vs. numbers). It is argued that the subjects
after reversal, adopt a controlled search
strategy in which they search for the category
as a whole rather than search for the in
dividual members of the category
The results of Experiments 1 and 2 could
hardly have provided a more dramatic demon
stration of the qualitative difference between
automatic detection and controlled search
and of the dependence of the search mecha
nism on the nature of the training procedures
(i.e., the consistency of the stimulusresponse
mapping
The results of Experiments 1 and 2 also
demonstrate the long-term nature of the
learning underlying the automatic process
Experiment 1 showed that even original
learning of an automatic response could take
thousands of trials of practice to develop if
a previously known categorization did not
distinguish the memory ensemble and the dis
tractor set. Relearning after reversal was
even slower to develop. Experiment 2 showed
that relearning after reversal could be very
retarded even when the sets were categorized
as long as the original automatic detection
process was well overlearned
C. The Role of Categorization in Controlled
Search and in the Development
oj Automaticity
The role played by categorization in con
trolled search and in the development of
automatic detection is suggested by results
of the preceding experiments, but it is an
important enough concept to be examined
in a separate experiment. Furthermore, the
nature of the process by which categories
are learned is also worth studying. These
considerations underlay the design of Experi
ment 3. We decided to use new subjects and
to train them in two conditions, in neither
of which were the memory and distractor
sets preexperimentally categorized. The first
condition was designed to induce controlled

gorization could not develop. The second con
dition was also designed to induce controlled
search, but in circumstances such that a
categorization of the memory sets could be
learned. Both of these conditions utilized a
varied-mapping procedure to prevent auto
matic detection, and both were followed by
a series of CM trials, during which trials
automatic detection developed. Thus, the
CM trials traced the course of development
of automatic detection when a categoriza
tion was, or was not, present at the start of
CM training
1. Method
The subjects each took part in two conditions
called mixed and categorical, run in different blocks
In each condition the memory ensemble and dis
tractor set were drawn from a total of eight con
sonants. The two eight-consonant sets did not over
lap. The sets were {GMFP, CNHD} and RVJZ
BWTX}. The assignment of these two sets to the
two conditions was permuted across subjects
Both conditions used a VM procedure similar in
certain respects to that of Experiment 2 of this
report and Experiment 3 of Part I. The multiple
target, multiple-frame paradigm was used with
/ — 250 msec per frame. Only 12 frames were used
on each trial, with all targets appearing on frames
3 through 10. Frame size was equal to 2 in all con
ditions, and two memory-set sizes were used in
different blocks: M = 2 and Af =
In the mixed condition, the members of the
memory set were chosen randomly on each trial from
the ensemble of eight consonants; the distractor set
consisted of four items randomly chosen from
those consonants not used in the memory set. These
four .distractors were chosen randomly to fill the
nontarget, nonmask, positions in the various frames
of the trial. The key feature of the mixed condition
was the fact that memory-set items and distractors
were randomly intermixed from trial to trial
In the categorical .condition, the eight ensemble
items were divided into two sets of four that re
mained disjoint throughout the experiment for each
subject. The sets of four are indicated by the posi
tion of the comma in the above listing of the con
sonants making up each set. Note that the two sets
of four were chosen to be highly confusable with
each other in the sense that pairs of visually con
fusable letters were separated into the two sets. On
a given trial one of these sets of four was chosen
randomly to be the distractor set, and the memory
set items were then chosen randomly from the
remaining set. Thus, in the categorical condition
there were just two disjoint categories of items
one from which the memory set was drawn, and
one that served as the distractor set. However, the
category that served as the distractor set varied
randomly from trial to trial. Thus, 'the procedure
still involved a varied mapping, but the categories
were never intermixed and could eventually become
well learned
To make it easier for the subjects to learn the
categories, the members of the memory set pre
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
sented at the start of each trial were always pre
sented in alphabetical order (this was also done in
the mixed 'condition). In each session there were
four blocks, always run in the following order
(a) categorical condition, M = 2; (b) categorical
condition, M = 4; (c) mixed condition, M = 2; d
mixed condition, M = 4. There were 96 trials in
each block, 24 with no target, 24 with one target
and 6 for each of the eight combinations of spacing
and target similarity when two targets were
presented
Four new subjects, one male and three females
took part. Each ran in 24 sessions of about 1 hour
each. This finished the first, varied mapping, phase
of the study. After these 24 sessions the subjects
should have been using controlled search in both
conditions, but should have learned the categories
in the categorical condition. Before turning to the
CM procedure used in subsequent sessions, we shall
discuss the VM results
2. Results and Discussion of the VM
Conditions
The results are summarized in Figures
and 6. Figure 5 gives the estimated prob
ability of detecting both targets when two
are present, averaged across target similarity
spacing, subjects and certain combinations of
sessions. Performance in all four main con
ditions tended to improve during VM train
ing, but is clearly stable over the last
sessions (15-24). Initially the M = 2 con
dition is superior to the M — 4 condition in
both the categorical and mixed cases
After training, however, the pattern changes
considerably. In the categorical conditions

tions converge (indicating category learning

In the mixed condition performance in the

the M = 2 condition, but performance in
both of these is worse than in either cate

ence of well-known categories reduces the

To ascertain whether controlled search was
being utilized in these various VM conditions
and to determine the nature of that search, it
is necessary to consider the spacing functions
shown in Figure 6. This figure gives the
spacing functions for Sessions 19-23, when
performance had stabilized, averaged across
subjects. For both M = 2 and M = 4 con
ditions, the mixed condition shows the pat
tern we have come to expect for controlled
search, with performance worse at spacing
and worse for different targets NI
Performance in the categorical condition
was equivalent when M = 2 and M —
The usual performance impairment at spacing
1 occurs for identical targets (II), but when
the two targets differ (NI), performance in
the spacing 0 condition is greatly impaired
a result not seen in previous VM conditions
Furthermore, the II and NI conditions show
only a small difference except at spacing
The results from the mixed condition con
form to the pattern expected for controlled
search in three respects; When M = 4 per
formance is worse than when M — 2; there
is a performance reduction at spacing 1; and
performance is worse for NI than II con
ditions
The results from the categorical condition
were unexpected in some respects but are
explicable in terms of an hypothesis that
categories were learned and utilized in con
trolled search. Let us assume that the pres
ence of a known category allows one to com
pare the category of the memory set to the
category of any given display item in a single
operation. Then the M = 2 conditions should
not differ from the M — 4 conditions, and in
fact both conditions should show performance
levels equivalent to those expected for a
memory-set size of 1 in a normal mixed con
dition. This reasoning explains why the cate
gorical conditions are both superior to the
best mixed condition, which uses a memory
set size of
The category hypothesis, however, sug
gests that target similarity should not matter
so that the II and NI functions should be
identical. To explain the spacing 0 results
without abandoning the category model, we
suggest the following hypothesis. Suppose
that when a subject locates a target category
he or she briefly switches to an item mode
perhaps to check that the input is truly a
category member. If the second item in the
frame is identical, then it will be found in an
item-comparison mode, but if nonidentical, it
will be located only if the subject reverts
quickly enough to a categoricalcomparison
mode. By the next frame, the reversion to a
categorical mode is complete, so the various
functions tend to converge. Why would sub
jects tend to switch to an item mode? The
categories were constructed so as to be ex
tremely confusable with each other. Perhaps
category encoding is learned under these cir
cumstances but remains somewhat error
prone. Then it would be logical to check any
target category by using an item mode
Whatever the explanation for the details of
the spacing function, the data as a whole
make a strong case that categories have been
learned in the categorical condition during
VM training, and that the presence of cate
gories in a VM situation allows the subject
to adopt a simpler and more efficient form of
controlled search
The argument that controlled search is
operating in these conditions would be sub
stantiated if it could be demonstrated that
performance improves when the subjects
switched to CM training. We turn next to
the CM procedure
3. Method
Following the 24th session of VM training, a CM
procedure was initiated. In the categorical condi
tion, one of the categories was fixed thenceforth
as the memory ensemble, and the other category
was fixed thereafter as the distractor set. In the
mixed condition, a set of 4 was chosen and was
fixed thereafter as the memory ensemble—the re
maining 4 items were fixed thereafter as the dis
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
tractor set. The two sets of 4 used in the mixed
condition were those indicated by the position of
the comma in the listing of the two sets of eight
consonants: {GMFP, CNHD} and (RVJZ, BWTX
In other words, these were the same sets that had
been used as categories in the categorical conditions
for other subjects. This CM training procedure was
identical for both conditions and followed in other
respects the procedures used in the preceding VM
conditions. Each subject was given at least
sessions of VM training. The frame time after CM
Session 4 (Session 24 overall) was reduced to
msec and after CM Session 11 (Session 35 overall
was .reduced again to 120 msec (at the time of this
writing this study had not been completed
4. Results and Discussion of the CM
Conditions
The changes over sessions following the
switch to CM training are depicted in Figure
5. Consider first the results of Sessions
through 28, which immediately followed the
switch to CM training. Quite clearly, a very
rapid and dramatic rise in performance took
place, and furthermore, the results of the
mixed and categorical conditions tend to
converge. By Session 28 the performance
level in the mixed condition had risen to over
90% and in the categorical condition had
risen to over 95%. Since the subjects were
clearly approaching ceiling, the frame time
was then reduced to 160 msec and CM train
ing continued for six additional sessions
Note that performance was still improving
and that the mixed and categorical, and M
= 2 and M = 4, conditions effectively con
verged
It is interesting to note that during VM
training, 20-25 sessions were necessary before
the M = 2 and M = 4 performance levels be
came equal in the categorical condition. Thus
one might tentatively conclude that category
encoding in the present experimental context
required 20-25 sessions to develop. Thus
category encoding would be unlikely to de
velop for the mixed condition in just four
CM sessions. Yet after only four sessions of
CM training, the performance level in the
mixed condition rose dramatically and ap
proached that of the categorical condition. This
result suggests that automatic detection de
veloped in the mixed condition in the absence
of a well-learned category (at least during
the first four sessions of CM training). In
other words, the learning of a category is
apparently not a necessary prerequisite for
the development of automatic detection
Figure 7 shows the spacing functions for
the six sessions (30-35) of CM training run
at a 160-msec frame time. The results are
averaged over subjects and sessions. In ad
dition the M — 2 and M = 4 conditions are
lumped together since they did not differ
Somewhat to our surprise the pattern is al
most identical to that seen for the categorical
condition during the latter stages of VM
training, except that the performance level
is much higher. The comparable pattern from
the CM conditions of Part I/Experiment
was quite different: Detection was about
equal in all conditions except for a depressed
detection rate when spacing was 0 and when
the targets were identical. At spacing 0 the
present data clearly show performance to be
higher when the targets were identical
Disregarding the shape of the spacing
functions, the large improvement in perform
ance when CM training commenced does sug
gest that the subjects were learning auto
matic detection. An hypothesis that reconciles
these facts suggests that the subjects were
using automatic detection to locate the first
target, and were then reverting to controlled
search to check the accuracy of the target
detection. Some time may be lost before the
subjects revert to automatic detection. Thus
the advantage of II at spacing 0 would be
due to the temporary use of a controlled
search. This hypothesis is similar to that
used to explain the categorical results in the
VM conditions (Figure 6). In both cases, a
tendency to recheck the first detected item
may have led to an alteration in search
strategy. The reason may be the same in both
cases: Rechecking of located targets may
have been induced by the stimulus sets
which were chosen so that the memory set
and distractor set were maximally visually
confusable. Thus, both automatic detection
and category encoding may have been some
what error prone, thereby requiring recheck
ing in an item mode. We are currently ex
ploring this hypothesis
In summary, a number of conclusions can

First, arbitrary collections of characters can
be learned as categories. For this learning to
occur, it is necessary that the categories re
main consistently denned across trials, but
not necessary that the same category re
main the target set across trials. Second, the
learning of a category in a VM search para
digm enables the subject to adopt a more
efficient controlled search, one in which the
category of the memory set may be com
pared in a single operation to the category
of a display item, thus eliminating the effects
of variations in memory-set size. Third, a
switch to a CM training procedure results
in fairly rapid acquisition of automatic de
tection, with a concomitant improvement in
performance for both the categorical and non
categorical stimuli. These conclusions sup
port those suggested by the results of Ex
periment 2 in all important respects
D. What is a Category? A Discussion and
Selective Review
1. Some Hypotheses Concerning Categories
Experiments 2 and 3 showed how search
benefits from the learning of a categorical
distinction between memory ensemble and
distractor set. But what is a category? Most
generally, we may define any object in mem
ory that refers to (stands for, consists of
any two or more objects in memory as a
category. Verbal labels are one common class
of categories, but other types of categories
might also exist. For example, a visual symbol
might represent several objects. Of course, a
category in general need not exist in a form
similar to any of the sensory modalities. A
completely abstract node could represent two
or more objects in memory
With respect to search tasks, the import
ance of categories is clear. When all of the
members of a memory set are members of
the same category and no distractors are in
that category, then a controlled search can
bypass the individual memory-set items and
utilize comparisons that involve matching the
single category against the category of each
display item. For category search to be uti
lized effectively, however, the category must
be learned well enough that each displayed
element will be encoded automatically and
consistently according to its category. Of
course other features, such as the elements
name and shape, will also be encoded, but
only the category feature is necessary for a
category search. We suggest that the category
coding must be automatic, because if it were
not, a search of long-term memory would
have to be carried out to identify the cate
gory; the time taken for such a longterm
search would almost certainly wipe out any
gains that are due to the reduction in num
ber of comparisons allowed by the category
search (at least for small memory-set sizes
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
Note that automatic category encoding is
not the same as automatic detection. Auto
matic detection refers to the case when a
stimulus gives rise to an automaticattention
response that bypasses the need for a serial
search through either memory or the display
Automatic category encoding refers to the
case when the stimulus gives rise auto
matically to a node representing the category
of the stimulus. However, without an at
tention response attached to the stimulus
node or the category node, the presence of
the category would have to be deduced
through a serial search of the displayed
elements
Our studies have shown that an automatic
category encoding of arbitrary collections of
characters (consonants, in the case of Experi
ment 3) can develop. The cause of the learn
ing is not yet clear. Some subjects in early
versions of Experiment 3 never showed any
evidence of categorical search (usually sub
jects with low levels of performance). It may
be that these subjects did not notice the
categorical nature of the memory ensemble
and hence could not develop a welllearned
category node in memory. Alternatively
these subjects could have developed an ap
propriate category node but have failed to
use this node to facilitate their search
There are several lines of evidence sug
gesting that automatic detection may develop
faster if a categorization is available at the
start of consistent training. For example, it
is easy to learn to search for a set of stimuli
defined by a simple physical feature see
Neisser, 1963, 1967, and studies in the next
section). The CM results in Figure 5 show that
the categorical condition retains some superi
ority over the mixed condition for about eight
sessions (25-32) but the magnitude of the
difference is surprisingly small. It is possible
that the high confusability between the two
categories of Experiment 3 makes the cate
gories and the automatic response difficult to
learn. If so, more training prior to the CM
phase could possibly have led to a larger dif
ference in the rate of development for the
two groups. Alternatively (or additionally
the small size of these categories may have
allowed automatic responses to the individual
members to develop so quickly that advan
tages due to a category response were mini
mized
It is conceptually important to keep in
mind the possibility that automatic responses
might be attached to different stages of en
coding of a single stimulus. In particular
when an automatic-attention response de
velops for a category, other attention re
sponses may develop at a different rate for
the stimuli making up that category. Thus
if a categorization is available at the start of
CM training, the attention responses to the
category might develop sooner than atten
tion responses to some or all of the individual
stimuli in the category. This effect would be
expected since any one stimulus would appear
only occasionally as a target, whereas every
target would be an instance of the category
On the other hand, in the cases in which the
memory ensemble does not form a category
at the start of CM training, there might be
at least some individual stimuli that come
to elicit automatic-attention responses while
the category is still being learned
Once an automatic-attention or encoding
response develops, we assume that it is no
longer under control of the subject and will
occur whenever its corresponding stimulus is
presented. This assumption will be supported
by Experiment 4. However, when a cate
gorial encoding (but not an attention re
sponse) is learned, it will not necessarily be
utilized by the subject during a controlled
search. We suppose a category response will
facilitate controlled search only if the subject
both notices the category and also decides to
alter his search to compare the category
rather than the individual stimuli. These
considerations would no longer apply if an
automatic-attention response were learned in
response to the category; in such a case sub
ject strategy would not matter since attention
would be directed to the category in any
event
2. Search Studies Using Categories
In a number of memory-search studies in
these studies F = 1 and M varies), the mem
ory set consists of several categories, and
144 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
the distractors might be drawn from these
same categories or from different unknown
categories. The results of these studies all
demonstrate the use of some sort of con
trolled search, perhaps in conjunction with
simultaneous automatic detection, that is
facilitated by the presence of categories
For example, Naus, Glucksberg, and Orn
stein (1972) and Naus (1974) used memory
sets consisting of words from several cate
gories and a distractor set made up of words
from these same categories. The results
showed linear memory-set-size functions
parallel for negative and positive display
items. However, there was a slope reduction
when the number of categories increased. The
authors suggested that categories were suc
cessively searched in random order, each in
serial, exhaustive fashion, until the category
of the displayed item was reached. When the
search of this category was completed, a
response was initiated. Homa (1973) pre
sented a related paradigm; his results sug
gested that a serial, exhaustive search of
categories was followed by a serial, exhaustive
search within the category of the displayed
item. Williams (1971), who presented an
other related paradigm, also argued that a
serial, exhaustive search of categories was
followed by a serial search within the cate
gory. Okada and Burrows (1973) used mul
tiple categories in the memory set and some
times cued the subject as to the category of
the displayed item in advance of the trial
Their results showed that the search could
be restricted to the cued category. Clifton
and Gutschera (1971) used memory sets con
sisting of two-digit numbers and showed that
on some trials the subjects would first com
pare the 10s digits and then would compare
the Is digit only if a 10s digit match was
found. Lively and Sanford (1972) used a
memory set from one category and a dis
tractor set consisting of some members of
that category and other members outside
that category. Negative items outside the
category of the memory set showed a setsize
function with reduced slope
The various findings in these memory
search studies differ in many details that will
not be discussed here. They all tend to show
the use of some sort of controlled search that
is facilitated by the presence of categories in
the memory set
The final studies to be considered are those
visual search studies in which M = 1 and F
varies, but in which the visually presented
items fall in two or more categories, one of
which matches the category of the memory
3 We shall not attempt at this time to explain
why a particular controlled search strategy is adopted
in a particular paradigm. Procedural differences
among the studies would make such explanations
pure guesswork. Another class of studies using
categories also deserves mention for completeness
but is not discussed in the main text because of a
difficulty in ascertaining whether the effects found
in these studies were due to automatic or controlled
processing. These are visual search studies (M =
F varied) that have used memory ensembles and
distractor sets from different categories. They have
shown either flat set-size functions or curvilinear set
size functions with reduced slopes (e.g., Brand
1971; Ingling, 1972; Jonides & Gleitman,
1976). These studies have utilized CM designs with
low practice levels; this makes it difficult to ascertain
whether the slope reductions are due to the presence
of automatic detection, to beneficial effects of cate
gorization on controlled search, or to some combina
tion of these factors
Note that the slope reductions for visual setsize
functions normally should be taken as evidence of
automatic detection. That is, in a controlled search
one would expect a serial comparison process to
be needed to compare the memorized category
against the category of each displayed item. How
ever, it was seen in our VM 'data from Part I
Experiment 2 that a reduction of slope occurred
when M was equal to 1 and F varied, and we sug
gested that a "controlled parallel search" might be
responsible for this result. A similar argument might
be made to explain the slope reductions in the above
visual search studies. We do not particularly favor
such an explanation because it does not explain
why normal set-size functions are found in visual
search studies that do not use categories eg
Atkinson, Holmbren, & Juola,
A finding related to those from studies using
categories in visual search is that of De Rosa and
Morin (1970) in a memory search study. They
showed that when the memory set consisted of
consecutive digits, then both the positive and nega
tive reaction times increased as a function of the
numerical closeness of the displayed item to the
boundaries of the consecutive memory set. The CM
procedure was used with small amounts of practice
so it is again difficult to ascertain whether such
effects were due to the action of automatic detection
or to some controlled search facilitation allowed by
the categorical character of the memory set
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
set item. Smith (1962) and Green and Ander
son (1956) carried out similar studies in which
a field of colored two-digit numbers was pre
sented and the subject was asked to search
for a particular two-digit number in a par
ticular color. The results showed that search
rate depended much more on the number of
items in the designated color than on the
total number of items presented, though both
effects were present. A VM procedure was
utilized in their studies so that automatic
detection could not have been used to restrict
search to the items of a particular color
Probably a two-phase controlled search was
utilized in this situation. First, a rather fast
serial search was probably carried out to
locate the next item of the designated color
then a slow comparison of that twodigit
number was probably made to determine
whether it was the target. This explanation is
supported by the fact that searching took a
long time (up to 20 sec), so that a 30-40 msec
search rate for color could have accounted
for the increases in response time as total
size increased. These increases were small
only in comparison with the larger within
category effects
The main conclusion to be drawn from the
studies reported in this section, based on re
peated findings, is that the presence of cate
gories in search tasks can be used to facilitate
benefit, and modify controlled search
III. Experiments on Focused Attention
In part I we made the case that the
processes utilized in attention experiments and
those utilized in search and detection experi
ments are often the same. In fact, in many
cases it is purely arbitrary whether a given
study is referred to as an attention
"search," or "detection" study. Experiment
in Part I could be described as a divided
attention study in which attention had to
be divided among M memory-set items and
F frame items during each frame. The results
showed tremendous deficits in dividing at
tention in the VM conditions, and virtually
no deficit in dividing attention in the CM
conditions. The results of Experiment 2 of
Part I, and the fit of the quantitative model
to both studies, showed that dividedatten
tion deficits in these paradigms are due to
the limitations of controlled processes, in
particular, to the limited rate of shortterm
search
Thus, all our comments and conclusions
concerning search and detection apply equally
well to attention studies. In particular, CM
training should lead to the development of
automatic detection that shoulld bypass
divided-attention limitations, while VM
training should cause controlled search that
should severely limit the ability to divide
attention
In discussing the development of automatic
detection we have proposed that an auto
matic-attention response is learned in re
sponse to the unchanging members of the
memory ensemble. The present study will
test this hypothesis. The test Experiment
4d) will entail asking the subject to ignore
certain locations and then inserting in those
locations items that subjects had been pre
viously trained to respond to as CM targets
(to see whether these targets attract atten
tion
These studies will also answer the following
question: To what degree can the subject
focus attention on a specified subset of the
inputs without distraction from the remain
ing (irrelevant) inputs. Such studies are
usually termed focused-attention studies, in
contrast to the studies of Part I and Experi
ments 1 to 3 of the present article, studies
that would be appropriately termed divided
attention studies
A. Terminology
There is a problem of terminology in the
studies of this section that is best solved by
the introduction of the following definitions
1. A foil refers to any input that appears in
a to-be-ignored display location, whereas a
distractor refers to a nontarget that appears
in to-be-attended display location
2. A CM foil is a foil that has previously
been used in CM training as a memoryset
item
3. A CM target foil is a CM foil that would
have been a target requiring a positive re
sponse if it had appeared in a tobeattended

B. Focusing Attention in a VM Multiple
Frame Task
The first study in the present series of
experiments is designed to show that con
trolled search" is not a misnomer, that sub
jects can control their search to the extent
that VM foils can be ignored, and that search
can be carried out through the valid display
positions without decrement caused by the
foils
1. Met hod
The paradigm utilizes the multiple-target, multiple
frame VM procedure. There are three main con
ditions: (a) M = 2, F = 2; (b) M = 2, F = 4; c
M = 2, F = 4, diagonal. Condition (c), denoted
"diagonal," was designed so that one of the di
agonals of the display was always valid tobe
attended), and the other diagonal was always in
valid (to-be-ignored). In this condition four char
acters were presented on each frame, two valid
and two invalid foils. We expected that this diagonal
condition would elicit performance similar to that
for the M = 2, F = 2 condition, and better than
that of the M = 2, F = 4 condition
The four subjects in this study were the same
as those used as in Experiment 3 of Part I. In
the diagonal condition, only the upper-left and
lower-right frame positions ever contained a target
The subjects were fully instructed regarding this
fact and were instructed to ignore the invalid
diagonal. For each subject, the blocks of trials
utilizing the diagonal procedure were run after the
other conditions were completed. The M = 2, F =
condition had 14 blocks per subject; the M =
F = 4 condition had 11 blocks per subject; the
diagonal condition had 16 blocks per subject, the
first 4 of which were practice blocks. There were
120 test trials per block, plus an additional
trials of practice for the first block of a session and
15 trials of practice for each subsequent block in
a session
The procedure used in this study differed some
what from that of Part I/Experiment 3 and from
the other multiple-target tasks reported in this
article. The primary difference lay in the relation
of target similarity to spacing. The spacing 0 con
dition utilized NI targets only, and the spacing
2, and 4 conditions utilized II targets only. In
addition, the present experiment allowed targets to
reoccur in the same frame positions if they were not
in successive frames. Also, in the present study, the
subjects pushed a single response button each time
they thought they detected the target. The responses
were to be made when the targets appeared rather
than at the trial's end
2. Results and Discussion
On about 1% of the trials in each condition
a response was made before the target ap
peared, and these responses were not counted
The results are presented in Figure 8. The
results of the F = 2 and diagonal conditions
obviously do not differ, but results of both
conditions are clearly superior to those of the
F = 4 condition. These results were expected
on the supposition that the subject should
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
have been able to control his processing in
the diagonal condition so that comparisons
would occur only for the characters on the
valid diagonal
The peculiar relationship of spacing to
target similarity in this study caused the
shape of the spacing functions to appear to
differ from those in previous multipletarget
studies. In fact, however, the corresponding
points from the present study and Part I
Experiment 3 are quite close in value. It is
interesting to note the subject's comments
at the end of the experiment. They noticed
an excess number of II conditions overall, but
none noticed that the II pairs were not tested
at spacing 0, nor that the NI pairs were not
tested at the longer spacings
The implications of this study are straight
forward. Subjects can control their search in
VM situations at least to the degree that
comparisons can be limited to a specified
diagonal. It is possible that characters on the
invalid diagonal are sometimes compared, but
not until the valid diagonal is searched first
(if time were taken to compare foils during
the search of the valid diagonal, then per
formance would be worse). Of course, this
study demonstrates only a minimum amount
of subject control. In future studies it would
be desirable to explore this matter more
thoroughly. For example, we might ask
Can search alternate between diagonals in
successive frames? Can search order be cued
individually for each frame
C. Distraction Caused by Targets
During VM Search
Experiment 4a showed no distracting effect
of VM foils (on the invalid diagonal). How
ever, none of these foils was in fact identical
to any member of the memory set. The
present study, then, is designed to determine
the distracting effect of VM target foils: To
what extent can members of the memory set
be ignored when they appear in invalid dis
play locations
1. Method
The paradigm is similar in general outline to
that of the VM conditions of Part I/Experiment

and the target foil. Varied-mapping procedures were
used, and frame time was 200 msec
The peculiarities of Experiment 4a were eliminated
The multiple-frame procedure was utilized with
M = 2 and F = 4. The upper-left, lowerright
diagonal was valid, and the other diagonal was
invalid. Either zero or one targets appeared on
the valid diagonal, and an appropriate binary re
sponse was required. A VM task was utilized on
the valid diagonal, and the foils on the invalid
diagonal were chosen from the distractor set for the
valid diagonal. In addition, there was on every
trial exactly one VM target foil (i.e., a member of
the memory set) on the invalid diagonal
On one-third of the trials, only a VM target foil
appeared, always on frames 8-13. On two-thirds of
the trials both a target foil and target appeared
on one-half of these trials the target and target
foil were identical (FII), and on one-half of these
trials the target and target foil were different FNI
Finally, the target appeared on any of frames
and the target foil appeared equally often on frames
—4, —1, +1, and +4 with respect to the target
frame. That is, the spacing between the target and
target foil was systematically varied. Thus, the
target-foil-only trials occurred with a probability
of J, and each of the other eight conditions occurred
with a probability of 8 X i = A. All these trials were
randomly intermixed within each block
Each block contained 144 test trials preceded by
15 practice trials. Each subject ran through a total
of 12 or 13 blocks in four sessions
2. Results and Discussion
The results are shown in Figure 9. The
figure gives the percentage of hits as a func
tion of the spacing between the target and
148 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
the target foil, when the target foil is iden
tical (FIX) and nonidentical (FNI) to the
target. The correct rejection rate when no
target was present was 91%. The results may
be summarized briefly: The target foil had
no effect on the hit rate except when it was
different from the target (FNI) and preceded
the target by 1 frame, in which case detec
tion probability was decreased by
In the present study a target foil reduced
performance when it preceded, but not when
it followed, the target, Suppose that this re
duction is due to the same factors that pro
duce decrements in multiple-target detection
in VM conditions (Experiment 3, Part I
Then one target probably inhibits detection
of a subsequent target, but not of an anteced
ent target. That is, the reduced detection at
spacing 1 seen in the VM conditions of Part
I/Experiment 3 and also seen in Figure
and 6 of the present paper, could have been
caused by either of the two targets' reducing
detection of the other. The present results
provide some reason to argue that it is the
first of two successive targets that reduces
detection of the second
Let us assume that the decrement in per
centage of detection of two targets in VM
paradigms is in fact a decrement in detection
of the second target. Then it is possible to
compare the magnitude of the decrements in
the multiple-target studies (e.g., Experi
ment 3, Part I) and the present study. In
fact, the decrements are much larger in the
earlier studies in which all display locations
were valid. For example, the difference in
detection between spacing 1 and spacing
in Part I/Experiment 3 was 30% in the NI
condition and 8% in the II condition; the
comparable decrements in the present study
are \\% and 0%. Thus a target foil reduces
detection of a target in the next frame, but
the reduction is much smaller than that
caused by an actual target
How can the present findings be reconciled
with those of Experiment 4a in which foils
did not impair performance? The pattern of
findings would be explicable if the valid
diagonal were always searched first and then
whenever that search finished early, one or
more characters on the invalid diagonal were
inadvertently checked in addition. In this
event, target foils would occasionally be
noticed and might harm subsequent detection
in a fashion similar to that caused by true
target detection. Of course, this hypothesis
is speculative and other explanations are
undoubtedly available
Whatever the explanations for the details
of the results, it is safe to summarize the
results of Experiments 4a and 4b as follows
Subjects are able to control their search in
varied-mapping paradigms. The degree of
their control is sufficient to eliminate any
distracting effect of nontarget foils and to
reduce the distracting effect of target foils
well below the level caused by other targets
Thus, attention focusing is quite successful
VM foils have, at most, a small distracting
effect when they appear in tobeignored
locations during controlled search
D. The Distracting Effect of Targets
During CM Search
Experiments 4a and 4b examined the
ability to focus attention during controlled
search. We next ask: To what degree does
attention focusing affect automatic detec
tion? Our previous studies have demonstrated
that automatic detection is not affected by
frame size, so there would be no point in
carrying out a CM counterpart of Experiment
4a in which the invalid diagonal would con
tain distractors only. We decided to carry out
a counterpart to Experiment 4b to find out
whether a CM target foil would interfere
with automatic target detection on the valid
diagonal
M and F were set equal to 2. During each
frame, each diagonal contained one mask and
one character. One diagonal was always
valid, the other invalid. On every trial a CM
target foil appeared on the invalid diagonal
in exactly one frame. A CM target appeared
on the valid diagonal on two-thirds of the
trials; on one-half of these trials the target
and target foil were identical (FII) and on
one-half, nonidentical (FNI). In each of
these cases, the target foil occurred either
four frames before, in the same frame with
or four frames after the target (-J probability
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
each). There were 162 trials per block and
blocks per each 1-hour session. Two sessions
were run with frame time equal to 60 msec
and two sessions were then run with frame
time equal to 30 msec
The results are shown in Table 2. The
only significant effect was a slight drop in
performance (about 4%) in the FII condition
at / = 60 msec with simultaneous target and
foil (0 = 4.45, p < . Q O Q l ) ; performance
dropped considerably when / dropped to
30 msec, but all conditions became roughly
equal
The results of this study demonstrate that
a target foil hinders detection of an identical
simultaneous target. The magnitude of the
effect is small, but so is the magnitude of
the decrement that occurs when two simul
taneous CM targets are presented. In fact
these decrements are not much different at
the equivalent frame times (4% vs. amp
It seems reasonable to assume that the same
mechanism is causing both effects
It is interesting to compare these findings
to those of Eriksen and Eriksen (1974). In
our terminology, they used a singleframe
CM task with M — 2, F = 1, and they used
reaction time as the dependent measure
However, the distractor set and the memory
ensemble were both of size 2 and were con
sistently mapped across trials, so that an
equally strong but opposite tendency to auto
matically respond to the members of the two
sets was probably learned. (In our CM
studies, only the memory-set items can come
to elicit automatic responses, because dis
tractors are presented on every trial. The
only exception in our studies occurred when
F = 1 in the single-frame paradigm of Part I
and even then the distractor set was always
larger than the memory set.) In the Eriksen
and Eriksen study, the relevant item always
appeared directly above the fixation point
but three invalid items were placed on each
side of the relevant item. The nature and
distance of these invalid items were varied
When the distance to the nearest item reached
1 ° of visual angle, the invalid characters had
little effect on reaction time. At closer dis
tances, all reaction times were slowed, but
flanking distractors produced the greatest

4 The results in Table 2 give some indications
that the disrupting effect may change with practice
Over the four sessions, the differences between FII
and FNI at spacing 0 was, respectively, 6.2%,
3.1%, and .7%. If this trend actually exists, it may
be caused by the development of a new automatic
response that restricts search to the valid diagonal
That is, position-specific information might govern
the automatic-attention response; such an auto
matic process could be learned because the valid
diagonal never changes over trials. It would be
interesting in future investigations to compare per
formance in this condition with performance in a
condition that alternates the valid diagonal from
trial to trial, since alternation should prevent the
long-term learning of position-specific encoding

Both the Eriksen and Eriksen
study and our study suggest that CM target
foils can neither be excluded from processing
nor prevented from affecting performance. In
addition, however, the Eriksen and Eriksen
result suggests that the spatial configuration
of the inputs can determine the magnitude
of these effects (see Footnote 4 for a discus
sion of location-specific automatic detection
E. The Distraction of Controlled Search
by Automatic Detection
Controlled search depends on an apparently
serial process that should easily be disturbed
if an automatic-attention response occurs
that draws attention to an invalid location
Such a rationale suggests a paradigm for
our next study in which CM foils appear on
the invalid diagonal while a controlled search
occurs on the valid diagonal
This study is probably the most important
in this series (4a-4d) because it provides a
test of the hypothesis that an automatic
attention response to consistently trained
targets is learned
1. Method
Each frame contained 4 characters. The upper
left to lower-right diagonal was valid. Memoryset
size was 2, and the VM conditions were utilized
Search on the valid diagonal was for consonants
in consonants (or digits in digits for other sub
jects). The foils on the invalid diagonal were
chosen from the distractor set used for the valid
diagonal, except for the CM foil. When a CM foil
appeared it was chosen from the set that had served
as the CM memory ensemble in all previous studies
for that subject. Thus, if consonants were being
used on the valid diagonal, a CM foil would be a
digit, and vice versa
On one-sixth of the trials, neither a target nor a
CM foil appeared; on one-sixth of the trials only
a target appeared; on one-sixth of the trials only
a CM foil and no target appeared; on one-half of
the trials both a target and a CM foil appeared
with the spacing between them equally likely to
be —1, 0, +1. Each block of trials contained
test trials. The first block of each session had IS
practice trials and the other three blocks had
practice trials. Two sessions were run for each of
the four subjects (the same subjects as those used
in Experiments 4a-4c.) The frame time was
msec
2. Results and Discussion
The results are shown in Figure 10. Each
percentage is based on 7,68 observations
When no CM foil or target appeared the
false alarm rate was 4%. When only a CM
foil appeared the fajse alarm rate was again
4%. Thus, in the absence of an actual target
the presence of a CM foil caused no increase
in false alarms. Since the appearance of CM
foils was highly correlated with the ap
pearance of targets, one might have supposed
that a bias or guessing strategy would arise
such that subjects would more often guess
that targets were present if a CM foil was
seen. The present data argue against such a
bias (as do the data discussed below
The hit rate when a target but no CM foil
was present was 84%. The distraction caused
by a CM foil may be determined through
comparison with this performance level
When the CM foil preceded the target by one
frame the hit rate was &2<fc, not significantly
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
lower than the 84% base rate. When the
target and CM foil were presented simul
taneously, the hit rate dropped to 62%. And
when the CM foil followed the target by one
frame the hit rate rose to 77%, a figure still
significantly lower statistically than the
hit rate when no CM foil was present. In
short, a CM foil provides little hindrance to
the detection of a VM target presented in
the following frame, greatly hinders detection
of a VM target presented simultaneously, and
even reduces slightly the detection of a VM
target presented in the preceding frame
The simplest interpretation of these re
sults is that a CM foil interrupts the ongoing
controlled search and causes a loss of process
ing time, thereby reducing target detection
The interruption is caused by what we have
termed an automatic-attention response to
the CM foil. We have argued that subjects
have been trained to respond to CM targets
with an automatic-attention response. Even
when such a target appears on a tobeignored
display diagonal, it apparently causes an at
tention response that interrupts processing
along the valid diagonal and directs attention
to the invalid diagonal. The time lost before
attention is returned to the valid diagonal
and the search is resumed causes a consider
able decrement in performance if the target
is in fact on the valid diagonal during that
frame
Since target detection in a frame following
a CM foil is not hindered, the recovery from
the distraction caused by a CM foil must be
quite rapid; that is, recovery must take place
in a time period under 200 msec. Further
more, the automatic-attention response must
occur fairly rapidly, since a CM foil even
reduces detection of a target in the preceding
frame. Perhaps the processing of one frame
occasionally overlaps the start of the next
for example, a comparison initiated but not
completed before termination of a frame may
be completed before controlled processing of
the next frame begins. Occasionally, a target
might be the character undergoing compari
son when the subsequent frame begins, and
a CM foil in that next frame could interrupt
comparison of the target and thereby impair
performance
The primary finding of the present study
is the demonstration that the responses to
CM targets are both well learned and auto
matic. CM targets cannot be ignored, even
when they are known to be irrelevant and
occur in consistently invalid display loca
tions and even when subjects are instructed
to ignore them
Our results, of course, do not establish
that it is impossible to control the detection
processes that we have labeled automatic
In fact, Sperling (Note 1, Note 2) has re
ported some findings that do tend to show
that at least some amount of control over
some aspects of the search process in CM
multiple-frame tasks is possible. However
the degree of control over, and the ability to
ignore, stimuli that subjects have been
trained to see as targets in CM situations
are clearly much less than in VM situations
Thus, for the processing mode in the CM
conditions of the present tasks, we prefer
the possibly slightly inaccurate, but de
scriptive, term automatic to the logically
more accurate, but less descriptive, term
systemic, which was used in Shiffrin Sa
to refer to the same type of processing
F. Limitations on the Ability to
Focus Attention
The present series of studies (4a-4d) ex
amined the subjects' ability to focus atten
tion. Experiment 4a showed that attention
during controlled search could be focused on
specified spatial locations. Experiment b
showed that the focusing is not complete
because certain types of stimuli in tobe
ignored locations are sometimes processed
and when processed, can reduce target detec
tion. Experiment 4c showed that a CM
target in a to-be-ignored location hinders
automatic deletion by a small amount. Ex
periment 4d showed that attention is greatly
distracted from the relevant locations when
a CM target appears in a to-be-ignored loca
tion during a VM search task. This last find
ing is particularly interesting because the
distracting stimulus differs from the relevant
stimuli not only in spatial location but also
in category
152 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
These findings are particularly important
because previous demonstrations of difficul
ties in focusing attention have usually utilized
incompatible responses. That is, a stimulus
in response to which a subject has been trained
to emit response x is presented in a tobe
ignored location in conjunction with a stimulus
requiring a response y that is incompatible
with x. In the Stroop Color-Word Inter
ference Test (1935), for example, the sub
ject must read names of colors that are
printed in ink colors that do not correspond
to the names. Reading speed is greatly slowed
in this case (see Jensen & Rohwer,
Keele (1972) showed that decrements in
processing stimuli resulted when a similar
color-name incompatibility was present. The
Eriksen and Eriksen (1974) study discussed
above also showed that response time was
dependent on the compatibility of responses
between stimuli to be attended to and those
to be ignored
Many other examples of this kind can be
found in the literature, but our demonstra
tions differ in one very important respect
Namely, the distracting stimulus in our stud
ies hurts performance even though subjects
have been trained to respond to it in exactly
the same way as to the target stimulus. Both
types of studies demonstrate that the tobe
ignored stimulus receives processing, but the
studies utilizing incompatible responses do
not demonstrate any processing interaction
short of the motor responses themselves. On
the other hand, our studies suggest that the
focused-attention deficit results from a di
version of attention and an accompanying
loss of processing time, since there is no re
sponse incompatibility
Our studies have shown that focusedat
tention deficits can arise due to distraction
by either CM or VM items in appropriate
contexts, though probably due to rather dif
ferent mechanisms in the two cases. In many
studies in the literature that have shown
focused-attention deficits, it is not clear which
factor is responsible. For example, in shadow
ing tasks the listener repeats aloud a desig
nated message (usually in one ear) while
other distracting messages are also presented
The early studies showed that distracting
messages barely harm shadowing performance
when they are distinguishable by an obvious
physical characteristic (such as spatial origin
see Cherry, 1953; Cherry & Taylor,
These studies are probably like our Experi
ment 4a in which one diagonal is relevant
during VM search and the other can be
ignored. A result related to Experiment b
can be found in studies by Treisman a
1964c) in which items of some possible
relevance are presented in the nonshadowed
ear (similar to our target foils). For example
if the distracting message is in the same
voice, but in French, a considerable distrac
tion occurs. Many studies have shown that
the message in the nonshadowed ear is an
alyzed to some considerable depth eg
Lewis, 1970; Treisman, 1960, 1964b). In
these studies it is not clear which type of
processing causes the analysis, but in other
studies it is clear that automatic processing
is responsible for the analysis that occurs
(Corteen & Wood, 1972; Von Wright, Ander
son, & Stenman,
Further reviews of such studies will not
be undertaken here because of the difficulty
in ascertaining whether focusedattention
deficits are caused by controlled processing of
invalid items or by automatic processing of
invalid items.5 If nothing else, our results
strongly suggest that future research on
focused attention should include controls to
differentiate deficits caused by controlled and
automatic processing
In summary, we have seen that subjects
can divide attention almost without deficit
when automatic detection is utilized (Part I
6 Controlled processing might be given to oc
casional inputs in an irrelevant ear, because ear of
origin is a fairly difficult cue to utilize compared
with spatial location in a visual task, for example
Whether automatic processing or controlled proc
essing is used to restrict analysis to the desired ear
occasional failures of selection are to be expected
failures that will cause occasional items in the tobe
ignored ear to be given controlled processing. In
addition, 'Controlled processing of items in the tobe
ignored ear may occur on occasion when processing
of the items in the valid ear is completed and a
brief interval occurs before the next valid input
arrives (an argument similar to this is used in the
discussion of Experiment b
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
Experiments 1 and 2, CM conditions, see
Figure 2) and cannot divide attention with
out deficit when controlled search is utilized
(Part I/Experiments 1 and 2, VM conditions
see Figure 2) . Focused-attention deficits are
quite substantial when caused by automatic
responses to to-be-ignored items Experi
ment 4d and Figure 10) but are quite a bit
smaller when caused by controlled processing
of to-be-ignored items, since the subjects
control is usually adequate to prevent such
processing (Experiments 4a and 4b, and
Figures 8 and 9). One implication is the pre
diction that the type of training procedures
VM or CM, will determine whether divided
or focused-attention deficits will occur
G. The Nature of Automatic Detection
The reversal studies, Experiments 1 and
and the category study, Experiment 3, make
it clear that long-term learning is responsible
for the phenomenon of automatic detection
that is seen in the CM conditions. The lengthy
training period required for acquisition, and
the even longer training periods required
to alter the detection process once learned
testify to the permanent nature of the learn
ing. Furthermore, the phenomenon is power
ful enough to transcend the laboratory
context. Subjects given CM training on
one group of letters as memory-set items with
another group as distractors, as in Experi
ments 1 and 3, report effects on reading out
side the laboratory. Despite the fact that all
the letters used in the experiments were
capitalized, the subjects reported that the
memory-set items from the CM conditions
tended to "jump out" from the page during
normal reading. This effect was distracting
enough that one subject would not attempt to
read for an hour or more after an experi
mental session
It is clear then that automatic detection
reflects a powerful long-term process. We now
ask: What is it that is learned? Experiments
4a-4d imply that an attention response is
learned, but many details of the automatic
detection process remain to be specified
It is our feeling that several factors con
tribute to the process that has been termed
automatic detection. First there is an auto
matic-attention response to the features that
are encoded from an input target; this re
sponse directs attention to the representation
in short-term memory of the relevant visual
input and also to the representation in mem
ory of the appropriate member of the memory
set. Second, in addition, an automatic tar
get" response is learned that tells the subject
that a target is among the inputs. Third, in
addition, in some situations an automatic
overt motor response (such as a button press
is learned in response to a target
The third factor, an automatically pro
duced overt motor response, is probably
limited to special situations in which the
same completely consistent response to all
targets is immediately required. Our reaction
time study (Part I, Experiment 2) may rep
resent such a situation, but our multiple
frame tasks do not. In the multipleframe
tasks, no overt response is required until the
trial's end. In addition, some of the tasks in
our studies require that the number of
targets be counted, rather than that a re
sponse be made to each target as it appears
Finally, the tasks in Experiment 4 occa
sionally present target foils in tobeignored
locations, and the subject has little difficulty
suppressing responses to such targets. Thus
we feel that automatic overt responses can
be learned but are probably not a major
contributor to performance in most of our
tasks
The first two factors, the occurrence of
automatic "attention" and "target" responses
undoubtedly play a major role in our tasks
However, such responses must be followed by
some sort of controlled process or controlled
decision to generate the required overt re
sponse. A number of controlled processes
may be used. In most of our studies it would
not have been sufficient to simply use the
occurrence of an automatic "attention" or
"target" response as a basis for a decision
to respond. For one thing, some of our studies
require responses to be counted; for another
some of our studies present target foils to
which responses must be withheld. Further
more, in Experiment 3 we saw that the mem
ory and distractor sets could be so confus
able that automatic responses could not be
154 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
learned in a perfectly accurate manner, so
that a switch to a controlled item mode was
necessary to check the accuracy of automatic
responses
For all of these reasons, we propose that
following the occurrence of an automatic
attention or target response, the subject en
gages in the minimal controlled processing
necessary to satisfy the task requirements
Such controlled processes might consist of
comparing the memory representations to
which attention has been drawn, counting the
target instances, and checking the spatial
location of located targets to see whether
they are foils or valid targets
Before concluding this discussion, it is
useful to consider briefly a few supplementary
hypotheses regarding the automatic detec
tion process. Each of these hypotheses as
sumes the occurrence of an automaticatten
tion response
First, consider the possibility that atten
tion is drawn automatically to the representa
tion of the relevant visual input, which is
then compared serially to the memory set
This hypothesis is easily rejected since it
implies, contrary to fact, that memoryset
size will have a large effect under CM con
ditions
Second, consider the possibility that an at
tention response directs the subject to the
relevant visual input, whose category is then
compared in one step to the category of the
memory set. This hypothesis is testable in
any of several ways but is difficult to reject
on the basis of present evidence. A tentative
inference from Experiment 3 suggested that
automatic detection for items in a fourletter
set developed much faster than category
learning for that set. If so, then this category
hypothesis could be ruled out (because the
M = 2 and M = 4 CM functions converged
quickly in the mixed condition of Experiment
3). Nevertheless, additional research will be
needed to test this hypothesis conclusively
Assuming that an automatic-attention re
sponse underlies automatic detection, it seems
clear why automatic detection does not de
velop in VM situations: An attention or overt
response that is helpful on one trial when
the producing stimulus is a target) will be
harmful on another (when the producing
stimulus is a distractor). A subject cannot
learn both an attending and a nonattending
response to the same stimulus. While this
argument seems clear, an important theo
retical question remains. What is the under
lying mechanism that inhibits the learning
of an automatic-attention response in the
VM search situation
Suppose that a Learning event takes place
each time a target is found correctly and is
therefore reinforced. In consistent CM
paradigms there will be no impediment to
the learning of attention responses. In VM
paradigms, the outcome is less clear. It might
be supposed that every item, whether cur
rently a memory-set item or a distractor
comes to elicit attention responses due to
those trials on which it is a target. There are
then several possibilities: (a) Learning con
tinues until all items have acquired attention
responses of roughly equal strength. Because
the responses are of equal strength, they tend
to cancel each other, and controlled search
must be utilized. Later, if a switch is made
to a CM paradigm, the strength of the re
sponses to the fixed memory-set items be
comes greater than that for the distractor
items, (b) As an attention response begins
to develop it starts to occur on trials when
the input is a distractor. Because attention
is directed to the wrong input, performance
suffers, and the response is therefore in
hibited, (c) Each time a distractor is com
pared during a controlled search, whether
or not an attention response occurs, inhibition
of any previously reinforced attention re
sponse may take place because a comparison
is carried out but not reinforced. According to
explanations (b) and (c), the inhibition
cancels any learning that would otherwise
occur, so that attention responses to any of
the items never develop to significant degrees
We prefer hypotheses (b) or (c), or any
similar proposal that implies that attention
responses do not develop in VM paradigms
Is there any evidence to distinguish these
views from hypothesis (a)? Only indirect
evidence is available at present, but the
models are easy to test. For example, after
VM training one could introduce new items
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
as targets, with other new items as distrac
tors, or with the previously trained VM
items as distractors. The old VM distractors
should severely hinder performance if they
elicit attention responses developed during
previous training. Other similar tests could
also be carried out, but a definitive answer
is not yet available at the time of this writing
IV. A Framework for Information Processing
This section of the paper will be organized
as follows. Section A will present an overview
of the system and an overview of the role of
controlled and automatic processing. Section
B will elaborate on the fundamental nature
of controlled and automatic processing. Sec
tion C will present a framework for search
detection, and attention. Section D will dis
cuss how automatic and controlled processing
are utilized in memory storage and retrieval
A. An Outline of a General Theory
Memory is conceived to be a large and
permanent collection of nodes, which become
complexly and increasingly interassociated
and interrelated through learning. Most of
these nodes are normally passive and inactive
and termed long-term store, or LTS, when in
the inactive state. The set of currently ac
tivated nodes is termed short-term store, or
STS. LTS is thus a permanent, passive repos
itory for information. STS is a temporary
state; information in STS is said to be lost
or forgotten when it reverts from an active
to an inactive phase. Control of the informa
tion-processing system is carried out through
a manipulation of the flow of information
into and out of STS. These control processes
include decisions of all sorts, rehearsal, cod
ing, and search of short- and long-term store
LTS contains learned sequences of informa
tion processing which may be initiated by a
control process or by environmental or in
ternal information input, but are then ex
ecuted automatically with few demands on
the capacity of STS
1. Long-Term Structure
The structure of the nodes making up LTS
will be treated as a very general graph with
complex interrelations among nodes. An in
dividual node may consist of a complex set
of information elements, including associa
tive connections, programs for responses or
actions, and directions for other types of
information processing. What then sets off
one node from a group of nodes? One node
is distinguishable from a group of nodes be
cause it is unitized, that is, when any of its
elements are activated (i.e., placed in STS
all of them are activated. One activated node
may of course activate another node, but it
does not do so in all situations, only when the
context or the state of the information
processing system is appropriate
2. Structural Levels
It seems likely that the structure of long
term store, at least in part, is arranged in
levels (perhaps sometimes in a hierarchical
tree structure). By levels we refer to a tem
poral directionality of processing such that
certain nodes activate other nodes but not
vice versa. In sensory processing, there is a
tendency for increasing information reduction
as successive levels are activated. Thus, a
visually presented word could first be pro
cessed as a pattern of contrast regions, colors
regular variations, and so forth; then lines
angles, and other similar features could be
activated; then letters and letter names and
verbal or articulatory codes; then the words
verbal code; and finally, the meaning and
semantic correlates of the word. This se
quence is meant as an example, and we do
not wish to imply that these are the relevant
features, that this is the only possible order
ing, or that this listing is exhaustive. Such
a sequence of feature encoding should occur
automatically to a normally skilled reader
3. Automatic Processes
An automatic process can be defined within
this system as a sequence of nodes that nearly
always becomes active in response to a par
ticular input configuration, where the inputs
may be externally or internally generated and
include the general situational context, and
where the sequence is activated without the
156 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
necessity of active control or attention by
the subject
An automatic sequence differs from a single
node because it is not necessarily unitized
The same nodes may appear in different
automatic sequences, depending on the con
text. For example, a red light might elicit
a braking response when the perceiver is in
a car, and elicit a walking, halting, or traffic
scanning response when the perceiver is a
pedestrian
Since an automatic process utilizes a rela
tively permanent set of associative connec
tions in long-term store, most automatic
processes will require an appreciable amount
of training to develop fully. Furthermore
once learned, an automatic process will be
difficult to suppress or to alter
When an automatic sequence is initiated
its nodes are activated and hence the as
sociative information enters STS. This fact
does not, however, mean that the various
elements of the automatic process must be
available to consciousness or recallable at a
later time. The activation in STS could be
extremely brief (in msec, say) and unless
attention is directed to the process when it
occurs or unless the sequence includes an
automatic attention-calling response, then
the information may be immediately lost
from STS, and the subject may be quite un
aware that the process took place. Even
when an automatic-attention response is part
of the sequence, it will not necessarily affect
ongoing controlled processing unless the
strength of the attention response is suffi
ciently high
4. Thresholds of Activation
However an automatic process is initiated
whether by internal or external input or by a
control process, it is presumed that the prob
ability that the process will run to comple
tion depends on the strength of the initiating
stimulation. The simplest and most common
examples are seen in studies of psychophysical
thresholds. If a letter, for example, is visually
presented at a low-enough intensity or a
short-enough duration, then it may be en
coded not as a letter but as a partial collec
tion of line-like features. At lower durations
or intensities even these features will not be
activated
Although we have described automatic
processes as largely beyond subject control
some indirect control is possible through ma
nipulation of the activation threshold for auto
matic processes. In particular, according to
what we shall call the contextual hypothesis
the activation threshold can be lowered by
the inclusion of information in STS (at the
time of presentation of the activating input
that is associatively related to the nodes
making up the automatic sequence
Note that a lowering of the threshold does
not imply that the quality of processing is
improved. One result of threshold lowering
is that the automatic process will be triggered
by inputs that normally would and should
not do so. For example, the feature horse
might be incorrectly triggered by the input
"house" if the threshold for "horse" is
lowered sufficiently
S. Controlled Processes
A controlled process utilizes a temporary
sequence of nodes activated under control of
and through attention by, the subject; the
sequence is temporary in the sense that each
activation of the sequence of nodes requires
anew the attention of the subject. Because
active attention by the subject is required
only one such sequence at a time may be con
trolled without interference, unless two se
quences each requires such a slow sequence of
activations that they can be interwoven
serially. Controlled processes are therefore
tightly capacity-limited, but the cost of ca
pacity limitations is balanced by the benefits
deriving from the ease with which such
processes may be set up, altered, and applied
in novel situations for which automatic se
6 It may also be possible to lower the threshold
by a .recent activation of the same automatic se
quence. However, this hypothesis is difficult to
distinguish from the contextual one, because an
activation of a sequence is usually accomplished by
the prior, .recent presentation of information as
sociatively related to the sequence, and this related
information is still likely to be in STS at the time
of test
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
quences have never been learned. Controlled
processing operations utilize short-term store
so the nature of their limitations is deter
mined at least in part by the capacity limita
tions of STS
6. Short-Term Store STS
Short-term store is the labile form of the
memory system and consists of the set of
concurrently activated nodes in memory
The phenomenological feeling of conscious
ness may lie in a subset of STS, particularly
in the subset that is attended to and given
controlled processing
The capacity of STS is determined sto
chastically (see Shiffrin & Cook, Note
so that a large amount of information may
be present (activated) at any one moment
but only a small amount of information will
persist for an appreciable time period of
several seconds or more. Forgetting or loss
from STS is simply the reversion of cur
rently active information to an inactive state
in LTS
What determines the loss rate? We sup
pose that the rate of loss of any informational
element or node in STS depends on the num
ber of similar elements simultaneously active
in STS. By similarity we refer not only to
formal physical similarity but also to sim
ilarity of features at comparable levels of
processing (e.g., the typeface of a printed
word will be less likely than the word itself
to cause forgetting of a verbally encoded
second word in memory). When a large
amount of similar information is present, the
loss rate will be rapid but will slow as the
amount of active information decreases. To
give an example, when a complicated visual
scene is presented to a subject briefly in a
tachistoscope, a flood of visual information
enters STS and initiates a series of chains
of automatic processing that result in higher
level features' also entering STS. However
most of the activated information will have
decayed and will be lost from STS in just
a few hundred milliseconds after physical
offset of the scene (see Sperling 1960); just
a few of the features, perhaps at higher levels
will remain present longer than a few seconds
STS has two somewhat distinct roles. The
first is the provision of a temporary store
house for information currently important to
the organism. That is, it acts as a selective
window on LTS to reduce the amount of
information for processing to manageable
proportions. The second role of STS is the
provision of a work space for decision making
thinking, and control processes in general
7. Learning: Transfer to LTS
Consider first what is meant by transfer
from STS to LTS. Transfer implies the for
mation in permanent memory of information
not previously there. To be precise, this con
sists of the association (in a new relation
ship) of information structures already in
LTS. A minimal requirement for this new
associative structure is the simultaneous
presence in STS of the separate elements to
be associated or related. That is, the various
nodes to be linked in a new relationship must
be activated in STS. Thus, transfer to LTS
does not imply the removal of the transferred
information from STS, nor the placing of
new "subunits" in LTS that do not already
exist in either LTS or STS. Rather, transfer
means the formation of new associations or
the strengthening of old associations) be
tween information structures or nodes not
previously associated (or strengthened) in
LTS. Most new associative structures will
include as a component the context in STS
at the time of the transfer
The above remarks specify the nature of
new learning in STS but not the cause under
lying the storage mechanism. It has been
7 An alternative formulation, closer to that sug
gested by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968), would
use the term STS to refer to those nodes that are
given attention and controlled processing. Other
activated nodes would be referred to by another
term, such as "sensory register" in Atkinson and
Shiffrin's terminology. At such a general level of
discussion, it is doubtful that there are substantive
differences between the two approaches—versions of
each could be constructed to be identical to each
other. Each approach has its own heuristic ad
vantages, but a theory is better judged in terms of
its detailed assumptions and predictions than by
its choice of either type of terminology
158 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
shown that rehearsal (and coding rehearsal
are strongly implicated in learning see
Shiffrin, 197Sb, for a discussion). We prefer
an extension of the rehearsal hypothesis. We
assume that what is stored is what is at
tended to and given controlled processing
Rote rehearsal is just one form that attention
can take. In fact, maintenance rehearsal may
result in storage of low-level auditory or
verbal codes not helpful for long-term recall
(but helpful for long-term recognition), while
coding rehearsal may result in storage of
high-level codes useful for recall. This model
suggests that some degree of attention or
controlled processing is a prerequisite for
storage. Thus, incidental learning situations
in which no extended rehearsal takes place
will still result in some learning to the degree
that the input items are attended to during
presentation
These hypotheses that controlled processing
will underlie learning apply of course to the
development of automatic processing, and
in particular, to the development of auto
matic detection studied in the search and
detection paradigms earlier in this paper and
in Part I. In those paradigms it was seen
that automatic detection developed only with
consistent training. Consistent training is
crucial when the learned sequences in LTS
contains an internal or overt response that
will be harmful to performance on trials that
are inconsistent. For example, an attention
response to an item will harm performance on
trials when that item is a distractor. Purely
informational sequences (i.e., sequences that
do not include responses that direct internal
processes or overt actions) will be stored in
LTS when attended to, regardless of con
sistency of training. In all cases, however
consistent training and large numbers of
repetitions should lead to stronger automatic
encodings and processes
An implication of the hypothesis that trans
fer to LTS is engendered by controlled pro
cessing is the important concept that con
trolled processing, and hence attentional
limitations, will be involved during the ac
quisition of automatic processing. We have
largely been identifying attentional limita
tions with controlled processing (e.g., con
trolled search) and have shown how auto
matic processing (e.g., automatic detection
can bypass attentional limitations. It should
not be overlooked that the initial learning of
automatic processing may require a variety
of control processes and hence will be sub
ject to various limitations that may dis
appear when learning has progressed to a
high level
8. Retrieval of Information from ShortTerm
Store
Several retrieval modes from STS are pos
sible. An automatic process might direct the
retrieval process to just a subset of the ac
tivated information (e.g., only the letters
not the masks, are compared in our VM
search studies
The various controlled search strategies
that are available are normally serial in na
ture but a variety of search orders is possible
Search order may depend upon instructions
strength of short-term traces, the nature of
categories of the traces, the modality of the
information, and the structure of STS. This
last point is worth emphasizing: Since STS
is embedded in LTS, it partakes of the struc
ture of LTS and is not a totally undiffer
entiated mass of information. Thus the order
ing of a search can utilize this existent struc
ture. In addition, the comparison process may
be exhaustive or terminating, and the in
formation located in one phase of the search
can be used to redirect a later phase of the
search
It is the control of search order that is
responsible for many of the selective atten
tion effects that are observed. Information in
locations to which attention is first directed
(i.e., the first locations searched) will in
general receive faster and more accurate
processing for the obvious reasons
8 This distinction is helpful in understanding the
relation of our work to studies of attention in
infrahuman organisms: the traditional studies of at
tention in discrimination learning and blocking eg
see Mackintosh, 1975) are involved with those
limitations that occur during acquisition, while a
number of newer studies are involved with limita
tions in steady state situations when learning is not
possible (e.g. see Riley and Leith,
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
9. Retrieval of Information from LongTerm
Store
Both automatic and controlled processing
are utilized in long-term retrieval. In gen
eral, an automatic associative mechanism will
cause currently inactive information in LTS
to become active when associatively related
information is in STS. The simplest example
is the perceptual encoding process by which
information concerning environmental inputs
is located in LTS. As each feature is acti
vated, it can serve as a base for further acti
vation of features associatively related to it
and to other previously activated features
This same principle applies to longterm
retrieval of higher order information
It should be noted well that information
once activated automatically from LTS will
then be in STS and may have to be located
through use of any of the short-term retrieval
mechanisms discussed above
How does the subject exert control over
LTS retrieval? The subject can utilize re
hearsal and selective processes to raise the
strength of certain information in STS above
the strength of other information. Then the
activated and retrieved information from
LTS will tend to be information related to
the selectively accentuated subset
In Shiffrin's (1970) paper the details of
the controlled LTS search were presented at
length. In summary, the controlled search
process is a series of cycles. On each cycle
(a) the subject generates probe information
and places it in STS; (b) the probe informa
tion, along with the general contextual infor
mation presently in STS, activates associated
information from LTS, called the search set
(c) the subject searches the STS search set
(d) the subject decides whether the appro
priate information has been found and
whether the search is over. The process then
continues cycling. Note that step (c) is a
retrieval from STS, so that one phase of con
trolled LTS retrieval may be STS retrieval
10. Long-Term Forgetting
The forgetting of information in LTS is
by definition in the present theory, a question
of retrieval failure. The retrieval processes
discussed in the preceding sections are by
their nature imprecise and fallible. When
retrieval fails, perhaps temporarily, then we
say forgetting has occurred. The causes of
such failure are somewhat to the side of the
main interests of this paper but may be sum
marized briefly as follows. First, the probe
cues used to activate related information in
LTS may be ineffective, either because the
subject chooses them incorrectly or because
the general context in STS at the moment is
dissimilar to that stored with the desired in
formation in LTS. Second, the process of
retrieval itself may harm additional retrieval
attempts, especially if the probe cues are
not altered from one cycle of the search to
the next. Third, the search may fail due to
premature termination; that is, it may fail
due to a decision that further retrievals are
not worth the effort, or due to the reaching
of some sort of time limit available for
search. (See Shiffrin, 1970, 1976, for a fuller
discussion of these matters
B. The Characteristics of Controlled and
Automatic Processing
In capsule form, we have covered the major
phases of the information-processing system
We shall now attempt to define and out
line the characteristics of automatic and con
trolled processing in a more precise fashion
1. Controlled Processing
It is important to note that not all control
processes are available to conscious percep
tion, and not all control processes can be
manipulated through verbal instruction. It is
therefore convenient to divide control pro
cesses into two classes: accessible and veiled
Accessible control processes are those like
rote rehearsal or alphabetic search of LTS
that can be instituted and modified by in
struction. These are generally slow processes
that are easily perceived by the subject
Veiled control processes are those like the
serial comparison of items in short-term store
that are difficult to modify through instruc
tion. They are not easy to perceive through
introspection because they take place so
quickly
Both classes of control processes have the
160 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
following general properties: (a) They are
limited-capacity processes requiring attention
Because these limitations prevent multiple
control processes from occurring simulta
neously, these processes often consist of the
stringing together in time of a series of
singly controlled unitary operations, (b) The
limitations of control processes are based on
those of STS (such as the limitedcomparison
rate and the limited amount of information
that can be maintained without loss), c
Control processes can be adopted quickly
without extensive training, and modified
fairly easily (though not always by verbal
instruction), (d) Control processes can be
used to control the flow of information within
and between levels, and between STS and
LTS. In particular, they can be utilized to
cause permanent learning (i.e., transfer to
LTS) both of automatic sequences and of in
formation in general, (e) Control processes
show a rapid development of asymptotic per
formance. For a given control process, if
automatic processing does not develop due
say, to varied-mapping procedures) and if
the constituent elements of the process do
not otherwise change due to long-term learn
ing, then performance level will stabilize very
quickly at an asymptotic value. When per
formance improves over trials, it does so be
cause the control process is changed, or be
cause automatic processing develops, or be
cause the constituent nodes that are linked
by the control process are themselves altered
by long-term learning
Common examples of control processes in
clude maintenance or rote rehearsal, coding
rehearsal, serial search, long-term memory
search, and decisions and strategies of all
kinds. These will be discussed in more detail
in the sections below
2. Automatic Processing
Automatic processes have the following
properties, (a) They are not hindered by the
capacity limitations of STS and do not re
quire attention. Thus automatic processes
often appear to act in parallel with one an
other and sometimes appear to be indepen
dent of each other, (b) Some automatic
processes may be initiated under subject con
trol, but once initiated all automatic processes
run to completion automatically though
some indirect control is possible through
manipulation of the contents of STS at the
time of the inciting input), (c) They require
considerable training to develop and are most
difficult to modify, once learned, (d) Their
speed and automaticity will usually keep
their constituent elements hidden from con
scious perception, (e) They do not directly
cause new learning in LTS (though they can
indirectly affect learning through forced al
location of controlled processing), (f) Per
formance levels will gradually improve over
trials as the automatic sequence is learned
In many cases asymptotic performance levels
may not be reached for thousands of trials
It is particularly important to specify care
fully what we mean when we say that an
automatic process does not partake of the
capacity limitations of STS. To make this
clear, let us suppose that X, Y, and Z are
nodes that are automatically activated in
turn by input I in the presence of general
context nodes C. We may depict the sequence
as follows
C C
As each of X, Y, and Z is activated, it enters
STS and its future residence in STS will be
affected by the limitations of STS. In fact
if the nodes X, Y, and Z do not include an
attention-attracting response, then it is quite
conceivable that all three nodes will decay
and be lost within a few hundred milliseconds
and the subject will be quite unaware that
such an automatic sequence ever occurred
Nevertheless, the sequence itself is not
governed by the limitations of STS in the
sense that the probability of its being ac
tivated and the rate of its occurrence will
not be affected by other concurrent automatic
and conrolled processes taking place in STS
(at least if context C is present and the
other concurrent processes do not also utilize
nodes X, Y, or Z
3. The Development oj Automatic Processing
The tendency for one node to activate
another will be increased if both nodes are
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
present simultaneously in STS and if a con
trol process and attention are directed toward
these nodes, thereby increasing their salience
in STS
Before we can describe efficacious training
conditions, we must distinguish between two
types of automatic processes. One type of
automatic sequence may be called actional
because it includes phases that direct internal
processes (like calls for attention) or phases
that produce overt responses (such as button
presses). A second type, called informational
contains no directions for actions. The dis
tinction is crucial because an informational
sequence strengthened on one trial will not
have deleterious consequences for perform
ance on other types of trials. On the other
hand an actional sequence may give rise to
a response antagonistic to a response re
quired on another trial. Thus, to be useful in
a given task, actional sequences require
special, consistent, training conditions
To make this point clear, suppose that
node B produces a response antagonistic to
that produced by node C, while nodes D and
E produce no responses. If any of A-B, AC
A-D, or A-E is trained alone, then that
sequence can be learned. If training on AD
is mixed from trial to trial with training on
A-E, then A will come to elicit both D and E
However, if A-B trials are mixed with AC
trials then learning of both will be impossible
since A cannot lead simultaneously to two
antagonistic responses. The automatic de
tection system discussed at length in this
paper is just an actional sequence, since an
automatic-attention response to one stimulus
is incompatible with a simultaneous atten
tion response to another stimulus; therefore
automatic detection requires consistent train
ing to develop. Thus, in the variedmapping
conditions of any of our studies automatic
detection could not develop and controlled
processing had to be utilized
4. Combinations of Automatic and Controlled
Processing
Although sensory inputs are first encoded
with the automatic processing system, with
the results being made available to con
trolled processing, it must not be concluded
that automatic processing invariably precedes
controlled processing. In fact, automatic and
controlled processes can proceed in parallel
with one another (as in Experiment 4d when
automatic processing of the elements on the
invalid diagonal proceeded in parallel with
controlled processing of the valid diagonal
Even more important, controlled processing
is often used to initiate automatic processing
Particularly in complex processing situations
(such as reading), an ongoing mixture of con
trolled and automatic processing is utilized
The next steps in the serial, controlled
processing sequence are based on the output
of automatic processes initiated earlier; then
new automatic sequences are initiated and
these run to completion in parallel with the
ongoing controlled processing
5. The Benefits of Automatic and Controlled
Processing
A system based on the two basic processing
modes with the characteristics we have de
scribed has many advantages. In novel situa
tions or in situations requiring momentto
moment decisions, controlled processing may
be adopted and used to perform accurately
though slowly. Then as the situations become
familiar, always requiring the same sequence
of processing operations, automatic processing
will develop, attention demands will be eased
other controlled operations can be carried
out in parallel with the automatic processing
and performance will improve. Some of the
advantages of such a system are (a) It allows
the organism to make efficient use of a
limited-capacity processing system. The de
velopment of automatic processing allows the
limited-capacity system to be cleared and
devoted to other types of processing neces
sary for new tasks, (b) It allows attention
to be directed (through automaticattention
responses) to important stimulation, what
ever the nature of the ongoing controlled
processing, (c) It allows the organism to
adjust to changes in the environment that
make previously learned activity patterns
useless or harmful, (d) It allows the organism
to deal with novel situations for which auto

certain input stimuli. Short-term store is the activated subset of long-term store. N levels of auto
matic encoding are shown, the activated nodes being depicted within each level. The dashed arrows
going from higher to lower levels indicate the possibility that higher level features can sometimes
influence the automatic processing of lower level features. The solid arrow from a node in Level
to the attention system indicates that this node has produced an automatic-attention response, and
the large arrow from the attention system to Level 2 indicates that the attention system has
responded. The arrow from level N to the Response Production indicates that this node has called
for an automatic overt response, which will shortly be executed. The arrow from Controlled
Processing to the Response Production indicates the normal mode of responding in which the
response is based on controlled comparisons and decisions. Were it not for the automatic responses
indicated, detection would have proceeded in a serial, controlled search of nodes and levels in an
order chosen by the subject

learned, (e) It allows the organism to learn
increasingly complex modes of processing by
building upon automatically learned sub
systems
C. A Framework jor Processing in Detection
Search, and Attention Tasks
The framework we have in mind is built
within the general theory already presented
It is illustrated in Figures 11 and 12. When a
set of inputs is presented (let us suppose
for convenience that the inputs are visual
then each begins to undergo automatic
processing. The system automatically encodes
each stimulus input in a series of stages and
activates a series of features in the process
For example, the letter "M" may first be
encoded in features indicating contrast
color, and position; then curvature, con
vexity, and angles; then a visual letter
code and a verbal, acousticarticulatory
code, then the codes "letter," consonant
"capital;" and finally, perhaps, semantic
and conceptual codes like "followed by N
"middle of the alphabet," and the like. We
do not necessarily imply that these features
are correct or exhaustive; if, say, amplitude
components of the spatial-frequency analysis
of the inputs prove to be relevant features
encoded by the system, the theory we de
scribe would be unchanged in all important
respects.) What features will become ac
tivated depends on the physical nature of the
nervous system that was predetermined gen
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
etically, the degree and type of prior learning
the physical characteristics of the display
(like duration and contrast), and the general
context, both that in the environment and
that generated in STS by the subject. To the
extent that the subject directs the sensory
receptor orientation and to the extent that
internally generated information can alter the
context in STS, the subject will have at least
some indirect control over automatic sensory
coding
The automatic processing as described
above takes place in parallel for each of the
input stimuli. The processing of each stimulus
is often independent, except for lateral and
temporal interactions at early stages, called
masking, and except for learned relationships
between items that may affect processing at
later stages (if adjacent letters form a word
for example). The various features that are
activated are all placed thereby in STS
where they reside for a short period before
being lost (i.e., before returning to an in
active state in LTS
We propose that some of the features or
nodes that are automatically activated may
initiate a response that will direct subsequent
processing or subsequent actions. For ex
ample, an attention response might be ac
tivated by a feature; the attention response
might direct controlled processing to the cor
responding set of features representing that
input stimulus, so long as other competing
attention responses do not occur simulta
neously. As another example, an overt re
sponse might be engendered by a particular
stimulus (such as a startle response to a
sudden loud noise, a galvanic skin response to
an aversively conditioned word, a ducking
response to a missile thrown at the head
If the set of inputs contains a target stimulus
that gives rise to a relevant nonconflicting
attention response, or to an overt response
then we say that automatic detection is
operating. Note that the attention response
could be attached to features at any level
of processing and to more than one feature
at a time. In Figure 12, as an example, at
tention responses are attached both to the
feature "8" and to the feature number

abbreviated) series of feature encodings for a frame in which two characters and two masks are
presented. The 'Consistent-mapping condition is shown in which numbers are memory-set items
and letters are distractors. The arrows skipping levels indicate that a given feature can help
activate features at several different levels. The stimulus 8 is a consistent-mapping target, and
hence both the visual and category codes produce automatic-attention responses. The attention
response has attracted attention to the information deriving from the input
164 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
It is possible that many of the inputs will
give rise to attention or other responses and
that these responses will conflict. For ex
ample, every input might automatically
engender an attention response; since it is
impossible to direct attention to every item
in the display at once, the various attention
responses will conflict and cancel each other
In such cases, the subject will not be governed
by the output of the automatic system and
will base subsequent actions and responses
on the results of a controlled search. These
hypotheses were supported in Experiment
(see Figure 4, left panel for the results). In
this study, all inputs were items that sub
ject had previously been trained to respond
to with automatic-attention responses. The
results showed that the subjects reverted to
the use of controlled search; furthermore
the controlled search was almost identical
to that seen in the usual VM conditions in
which none of the inputs had been trained to
elicit automatic-attention responses
In cases when the input stimuli do not
activate automatic responses that govern the
detection process, then a controlled search
must be used. In this event, the subject must
attempt to search through the set of features
that is activated and to use a search strategy
that is as efficient as possible. For example
in our visual search studies, letter codes are
normally compared in preference to and
prior to) sets of angles and lines; a category
code representing a set of letters is often
compared in preference to (and prior to
individual letter codes, as shown in Experi
ment 3. Furthermore, the order of search
and the placement of decisions within the
search are also controlled in an attempt to
increase efficiency. To give an example, com
parisons in our studies in Part I took place
in an order that cycled through the frame
for a given memory-set item before switching
to a new memory-set item, and a matching
decision was made after every comparison
To give another example, matching decisions
in many memory search studies (M varying
F — 1) are withheld until all comparisons
are completed (Sternberg,
Note finally that many attention tasks
utilize search or detection paradigms. When
ever this is the case, the framework described
here applies equally to attention tasks
Divided-attention tasks study the increments
in performance that may occur when the
load is decreased. Decreased loads are usually
specified through advance instructions that
certain inputs are irrelevant, thereby de
creasing the size of the memory set, the frame
set, or both
According to our framework, experiments
that do not show dividing attention to re
duce performance fall into two classes. One
class includes those studies in which auto
matic detection is operating. These are usually
studies utilizing a CM paradigm and high
degrees of practice. Divided-attention deficits
will not be seen because the target stimulus
will be detected automatically, in parallel
with the other stimuli, and often indepen
dently of other stimuli. An exception to this
general rule may apply when two (or more
targets are presented simultaneously on a
trial. Even if both targets generate attention
responses, there may be a difficulty in dis
criminating a double from a single occurrence
In such an event, the controlled comparison
system may have to be called into play to
count the targets. (A detection decrement
may then occur, because the second item
may have decayed from STS by the time
the comparison of the first item is complete
see Moray, 1975, Shiffrin, 1976, and the
discussion of the 0 spacing effect in the CM
condition of Experiment 3, Part I
The second class of studies in which di
vided-attention deficits do not occur is that
in which controlled search is utilized but the
capacity of STS is not stressed. Examples
are seen in the series of studies by Shiffrin
and his colleagues, summarized in Shiffrins
(1975a) article. In such studies either the
load in STS is kept low, or a cue informing
the subject which input is relevant appears
at about the same time as the inputs
It is, however, only in specially designed
situations that capacity limits are not stressed
In most studies requiring controlled search
the extra time required to search a larger
number of relevant inputs will impair per
formance, whether measured by reaction
time or accuracy. This was the case in the
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
VM conditions of the experiments reported
in this paper, and in Part I: In all these
cases increases in load reduced performance
There are two basic reasons for the perform
ance reduction in controlled search studies
First, some of the features in STS may decay
and revert to LTS before the comparison
process reaches them. Second, new inputs
may arrive and require processing, forcing
the comparison process to switch away from
the previous inputs. Probably only this second
factor operated in the studies we have re
ported in this paper. For either of these
reasons, divided-attention deficits can be ex
pected in detection tasks requiring controlled
search
The situation is quite different, however
in focused-attention studies. In these studies
certain inputs are known to be relevant, and
others are to be ignored. If controlled search
is being utilized, there is little reason to ex
pect that any substantial deficit will be
caused by the presence of to-be-ignored stim
uli, at least if it is clear to the subject well in
advance which stimuli and locations are
relevant and if there are no location con
fusions. In such cases the subjects should
direct the search order so that the relevant
locations are searched first; thus perform
ance deficits should not arise. Evidence sup
porting these propositions is found in Experi
ment 4a: Subjects were able to search one
diagonal and ignore the other
The tasks in which large deficits in focus
ing attention will occur are those in which
irrelevant items give rise to attention re
sponses during automatic encoding. In such
cases, attention will be attracted to the to
be-ignored item and a loss of time will occur
before the controlled search can be redirected
to the relevant inputs. The time lost will
impair performance. Such focusedattention
deficits were seen in the reversal results of
Experiments 1 and 2, and in the attention
results of Experiment
Thus, our framework can be applied to a
wide variety of search, detection, and at
tention tasks, although additional assump
tions must be made to generate precise models
to deal with the particulars of each task. In
Part I we presented a quantitative serial
terminating search model and discussed
some alternative models. Our discussion was
limited, however, to our basic single or
multiple-frame search task with small values
of M and F. We will now consider a few
alternative paradigms, along with special
assumptions they might require
1. Tasks Utilizing Large Memory Sets
Suppose there are too many items in the
memory set to be maintained in STS. Of
course, then, the memory set must be learned
in LTS in advance of the test. There are
then two basic search modes. In the first
the test item is automatically encoded and
accesses a node in memory that contains the
desired information. For example, in deciding
whether an item is any word, the input item
if a word, is encoded to the nodes represent
ing the word and the information in those
nodes is usually sufficient to classify the
item as a word; on the other hand, a non
word obeying appropriate orthographic con
straints is encoded to a lesser degree and the
failure of the automatic encoding process
could itself serve as a cue for nonwordness
The second type of search mode would con
sist of entering successive parts of the mem
ory set from LTS into STS, using controlled
search to examine each subset in STS. For
example, if asked whether there is a flower
country, or first name whose fourth letter is
"u" a subject might successively generate
members of each category and serially check
them
The above comments make it clear that
the case of large memory sets is not different
in principle from the cases in which the
memory set may be held in STS, though
the models may need additional assump
tions. For example, Atkinson and Juola
(1974) carried out a study in which sub
jects had a large memorized set in LTS
They proposed a hybrid model in which a
judgment based on familiarity enabled the
subject to decide on some trials without a
search that the test item was definitely in
or definitely not in, the memorized set. On
trials when this initial familiarity judgment
was ambiguous, then a controlled search
through the set was made
166 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
2. Large Display Sets
When large numbers of items appear in the
display, then it may turn out that acuity
varies considerably across the display for a
given fixation point. In turn, acuity changes
are likely to lead the subject to adopt a
strategy in which eye movements are used
to bring subsets of the display successively
into a high-acuity region. The location of
each new fixation can be governed by a
controlled search strategy or by an automatic
process, but in either event the necessity of
obtaining good acuity will force this process
to be serial across successive eye movements
Within each fixation, furthermore, either
automatic detection or controlled search could
be utilized. The search studies in which sub
jects scan rows of characters for targets have
shown both modes of search. For example
the Neisser (1963) results, reviewed in Part
I, showed that automatic detection developed
for subjects well trained in responding to
letter sets presented in CM fashion memory
set size had no effect), while controlled search
was utilized for sets that had been given
only small amounts of training. An interest
ing intermediate case occurred when the sub
ject was instructed to locate a row of char
acters that did not contain a given character
In this case, even with CM training, the task
proved quite difficult. In our view the sub
ject would have to adopt a serial process
from row to row (rather than from fixation
to fixation). Within each row automatic de
tection might be used to locate the key
character, but then a decision would have
to be made before the next row could be
considered
3. Categorical Partitioning oj Display Sets
Partitioning of the display set has usually
been accomplished by a categorization de
pendent on a relatively gross simple physical
feature, such as color, shape, or size. When
displays are segregated into two or more
groups by such features, processing may be
affected in two ways. First, the patterning
of the input can govern the nature of auto
matic processing—controlled processing may
be directed automatically to a subset of the
inputs (assuming that one particular subset
is consistently relevant). Second, the per
ceptual categorization could influence the
order and perhaps the nature of controlled
search. To give one simple example, a dis
play arranged in two separate rows will tend
to be processed one row at a time, in reading
order. A second example occurs in situations
where controlled processing can enable one
to more quickly decide about the category
of the input than about the memoryset
membership of the input. In these cases a
two-phase controlled search might be adopted
with the first phase locating the relevant
inputs by category, and the second phase
matching these inputs to the memory set
This is illustrated by Green and Andersons
(1956) and Smith's (1962) studies in which
a two-digit number of a particular color had
to be found in a display of many twodigit
numbers of differing colors
Automatic processing based on perceptual
categorization may have played an important
role in the studies of search and detection
reported in this paper. We have assumed
throughout that only the display positions
with characters, and not those with masks
are considered in the search. How is search
restricted to character positions? It is con
ceivable that a preliminary controlled search
is used to identify character positions, but
the results of Experiment 4a argue against
such a view—knowing the relevant diagonal
of a four-character frame leads to perform
ance identical to that seen when two masks
and two characters appear randomly on each
frame. Thus, a preliminary controlled search
would have to be extremely fast relative to
the time for each character comparison. More
likely, an automatic process develops that
directs the controlled search away from mask
positions and toward character positions
Since such a response would be consistently
trained and reinforced, it should be learned
in a fashion similar to that for automatic
attention responses
It should be noted that the development
of automatic responses to direct controlled
search is very similar to the process termed
by Neisser (1967) as "pre-attentive." Neisser
was trying to explain how search could be
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
directed to a perceptually segregated subset
of the inputs. We are suggesting that an
automatic process might develop and direct
the search in situations where the search
directing response is consistently trained as
is usually true in such studies). We do not
feel, however, that the segregation of the
relevant inputs must be based on simple
physical features. With enough consistent
training, an automatic search-directing re
sponse could develop for a set of stimuli
defined by quite complex features. For ex
ample, Gould and Cam (1973) reported
results suggesting that an automatic process
was directing search to the locations of items
from a set of 10 potentially relevant letters
and away from the locations of items from a
set of 8 other letters that never included a
target. (Any target was always drawn from
the potentially relevant set of 10 letters, but
on most trials distractors were chosen from
this set of 10 as well as from the set of
Although the evidence is not yet available
we raise the possibility that the converse of
the argument in the preceding paragraph
might also hold: Even with perceptual seg
regation of the display into categories deter
mined by simple physical features, auto
matic restriction of the search to the relevant
category might not be possible unless the
relevant category is consistent across trials
4. Attention Tasks
The models applying in attention studies
that utilize detection or search paradigms
are just those discussed in the preceding
sections. The general rule is that instructional
manipulations affect the order of controlled
search; increases in load cause the time
needed for controlled search to increase; and
consistent training leads to the development
of automatic responses that allow attentional
limitations to be bypassed
We will say a few words, however, con
cerning attention studies that do not utilize
detection or search paradigms. One class of
studies utilizes a memory paradigm. The
inputs are manipulated in ways similar to
those used in detection studies, but the sub
ject is asked to recall or recognize the items
at some time after presentation. One example
is the "split-span" technique reviewed by
Broadbent (19S8, 1971). Other examples
are reported by Sperling (1960) and Von
Wright (1970), who studied cued partial
report following tachistoscopic exposure of
character displays
In these memory paradigms, essentially
the same underlying mechanisms apply as
in the detection paradigms, though memory
storage rather than detection is the processing
goal. When controlled processing is utilized
the subject has considerable control over
storage: The items that are rehearsed or
coded are the items that will be recalled
If an input is presented that generates an
automatic-attention response, then this in
put will receive attention and tend to be
recalled regardless of the nature of the con
trolled process utilized to store the other
items. An excellent demonstration of these
points may be found in Kahneman S
5. Threshold Detection Tasks
An input in a threshold detection task, by
definition, is presented in such a way that
automatic encoding on most trials will be
incomplete and therefore ambiguous. That is
in Section IV.A.4 we discussed the fact the
input stimulation must be above some thresh
old level for automatic encoding to run to
completion in an accurate fashion. In Figure
12, for example, the "M," if presented near
threshold, might cause activation of some
of the features at the visual feature level, but
no features at higher levels. This set of
partial features will in general be ambiguous
—several letters and numbers might be con
sistent with the activated feature set. Thus
a target will on some trials give rise to feature
sets consistent with either targets or distrac
tors. Similarly, distractors will on some trials
give rise to feature sets consistent with either
targets or distractors. Under these conditions
it is clear even in CM situations that auto
matic-attention responses and automatic de
tection can only develop very slowly, if at
all, because the internal representations of
targets and distractors will be mapped con
sistently to responses only on those few trials
when the encoding happens to be complete
168 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
A similar argument applies if encoding is in
accurate rather than incomplete
Even in CM threshold tasks, therefore, the
subject will be forced to adopt controlled
search on most of the trials, namely the trials
on which encoding is incomplete. On such
trials a serial comparison process will be
necessary to match the activated features
against the features of the members of the
memory set. Occasionally, however, auto
matic encoding will manage to process the
target completely. Suppose that almost al
ways, those stimuli that are completely
processed will be encoded correctly. Suppose
also that a CM procedure is being utilized in
the task. In these special conditions, an at
tention response can be learned that might
be utilized on those trials when complete
encoding of the target happens to occur
A model very similar to this was used by
Shiffrin and Geisler (1973) to fit the results
from a threshold detection study by Estes
(1972). In that model, stimuli automatically
processed to a final, incomplete result were
called "component detections" and stimuli
automatically processed to the complete
(letter) level were called "letter recogni
tions." The model proposed a two-part con
trolled search in which the letter recognitions
were searched first (in parallel through mem
ory, but serially through the display), and
then the component detections were matched
serially, feature by feature, against the mem
bers of the memory set. In light of the
present work, we would like to propose for
consideration an alternative but similar
model in which the letter recognitions result
in an automatic-attention response, so that
controlled search need be utilized only if the
target is not among the letter recognitions
In practice, the predictions of these two
models would not differ greatly
In summary, it seems clear that controlled
search, whether at the feature or character
level, is bound to be the predominant de
tection mechanism in all threshold detection
tasks, but there is a possibility in CM para
digms that automatic detection can be util
ized on a subset of the trials when the target
happens to be encoded relatively completely
Our general view of processing, in threshold
detection tasks as well as many others, can
be summarized briefly in the following man
ner: Sensory inputs are encoded auto
matically, resulting in states of evidence
(consisting of feature sets) that the subject
utilizes in subsequent controlled processing
While generally accurate, this view is too
simple in several respects. First, it must not
be assumed that there is ever one moment
in time at which all activated features are
simultaneously present and available to the
subject for controlled processing. Rather it
will usually be the case that some features
will still be undergoing the process of en
coding (and hence will not yet be activated
while other features have already been acti
vated and are in the process of being for
gotten. Second, it must not be assumed that
controlled processing will follow automatic
processing in time. Such an assumption is a
fairly accurate simplification when used in
models for certain tasks including threshold
detection. However, it is an inherent feature
of our theory that automatic and controlled
processing can often operate in parallel, so
that controlled processing can begin while
automatic processing is still progressing. This
point becomes crucial in situations in which
the subject is required to give extremely fast
responses (including those paradigms pre
senting above-threshold stimuli), since a
very fast response might have to be based
on the features available at a certain point
in time, even though better features might
be available at a later point in time
D. Automatic and Controlled Processing in
Memory Storage and Retrieval
In this section we shall review briefly how
automatic and controlled processing might be
involved in short-term retention, learning
and in long-term retrieval
1. Maintenance of Information in Active
Memory
We suggest that the control process most
evident to introspection is rehearsal. Atkinson
and Shiffrin (1968) studied many tasks in
which subjects utilized a continually updated
rehearsal "buffer" to aid their memory sys
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
tern. Rote rehearsal is of course only one of
many control processes that cause items to
have an extended residence in STS; coding
deciding, retrieving, and the like also cause
a similar result, though these processes are
primarily intended to serve other purposes
Iq general, items given attention of any sort
are maintained in STS, including items to
which attention is drawn by an automatic
process
Items from which attention has been re
moved do not necessarily leave STS quickly
however. When the load is small and new
inputs are minimized, items can remain in
STS for extended periods (up to 40 sec in
the Shiffrin, 1973, study). Another example
is seen in the overt forced-rehearsal study
reported in Atkinson and Shiffrin (1971). A
long list of items was presented and subjects
rehearsed aloud a continually updated list
of the three most recent items. As a result
the last three items presented were always
recalled on an immediate test. However, the
probability of recall for items prior to the
last three decreased systematically as a func
tion of the spacing from last rehearsal to
test. Thus an item removed from controlled
processing still requires a period of time
before it becomes lost from STS (i.e., be
comes inactive). This persistence in the
absence of attention might be called the auto
matic component of short-term maintenance
It is this automatic component of persistence
that was studied by Shiffrin and Cook see
Note 3) and that determines the basic ca
pacity and persistence of STS. In brief
Shiffrin and Cook propose that the loss
process is a stochastic mechanism whose
rate increases as the amount of similar ma
terial concurrently in STS increases
2. Coding, or Transfer to LTS
The role of control processes in longterm
storage is well established. Rote rehearsal
appears to transfer low-level auditoryverbal
codes to LTS; these are not very useful for
long-term recall but can facilitate longterm
recognition. Coding rehearsal appears to
facilitate long-term retrieval of all kinds. In
general, what is attended to and rehearsed is
what is stored in LTS. (See Bjork,
Craik & Jacoby, 1975; Craik & Lockhart
1972; and Craik & Tulving, 1975, for a dis
cussion of these issues
The other side of the storage question con
cerns the nature of LTS transfer when at
tention is not directed to an item or sequence
of items. Studies of incidental learning tend
to show that subjects learn what they attend
to, not what they are told to learn (see Craik
& Tulving, 1975; Hyde & Jenkins,
1973; Postman, 1964; Schneider & Kintz

If controlled processing is necessary for
long-term learning then automatic processing
without controlled processing should not lead
to appreciable retention. One source of evi
dence is found by examining retention for
distractors in CM tasks. Such items pre
sumably have received almost no controlled
processing. However, it may be assumed that
due to prior exposures and prior learning the
distractors are given automatic encoding at
least up to the "name" level (for evidence
see Corteen & Wood, 1972; Keele,
Von Wright et al., 1975, among others
Does the automatic encoding that these dis
tractors receive during the many trials of a
CM task lead to any retention? Moray
(1959) had subjects repeat aloud a prose
passage in one ear while a seven-word list
was repeated 35 times in the other ear. Later
recognition for the unattended words was at
the chance level. Gordon (1968) showed that
a set of four distractors in a CM search task
was recognized near the chance level even
after 10 days of practice. Gleitman and
Jonides (1976) showed that distractors were
more poorly recognized in a CM search task
than in a VM search task (though, due to
the low levels of practice used in their study
the effect could have been due to the use of
a controlled search for categories in the VM
condition
Evidence of a rather different sort is found
in reading tasks. If automatic processing does
not lead to retention, then it might be ex
pected that a skilled reader who automatically
processes surface-structure features and who
gives controlled processing to conceptual
properties of a passage would retain little
information regarding the surfacestructure
170 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
details. Bransford and Franks (1971) have
collected data that may be interpreted in
this fashion. Of course, if controlled process
ing is directed toward levels of analysis
normally carried out automatically, then the
features attended to will be remembered see
Postman & Senders,
To summarize, whether or not some
nominal storage manages to be eked out in
the absence of controlled or attentive process
ing, it seems clear that any phenomenon that
would be appropriately called automatic
storage" is a far less important determinant
of LTS learning than controlled processing
Before leaving the general topic of learn
ing it is interesting to speculate on the de
velopment of complex informationprocessing
skills. Since controlled processing is limited
only a small part of the memory system can
be modified at any one time. After invariant
relations are learned at one stage, the pro
cessing becomes automatic and controlled
processing can be allocated to higher levels
of processing
For example, the child learning to read
would first give control processing and then
give automatic processing to various units of
information, The sequence of automatically
learned units might be foregroundback
ground, features, shapes, letters,, words, and
meanings of phrases or sentences. The child
would be utilizing controlled processing to
lay down "stepping stones" of automatic
processing as he moves on to more and more
difficult levels of learning. The transition
from controlled to automatic processing at
each stage would result in reduced discrimina
tion time, more attention to higher order
features, and ignoring of irrelevant infor
mation. Gibson (1969, chap. 20) describes
these effects to be three of the major trends
in perceptual development. In short, the
staged development of skilled automatic per
formance can be interpreted as a sequence
of transitions from controlled to automatic
processing
3. Retrieval from LTS
Retrieval from LTS has a large automatic
component. Sensory inputs result in an auto
matic series of stages of encoding that ac
tivate many features (and perhaps responses
and place them in STS. Internally generated
inputs also tend automatically to activate
associated information in LTS and to place
it in STS
In general, the two primary controlled
phases of LTS retrieval consist of the pro
cesses the subject uses to search and process
the information in STS that has just been
activated, and the processes used to alter the
probe information from step to step of the
LTS search
It is important to note that the selection
of probe information is not entirely under
subject control. In fact, the probe informa
tion includes the general contextual informa
tion present in STS at the time of retrieval
in addition to the specific cues the subject
manipulates to facilitate retrieval. The gen
eral context is only partly under subject con
trol, since much of it is environmentally de
termined and even the internally generated
context (e.g., what the subject is currently
"thinking about") may be difficult to alter
radically. Thus, changes in probe cues will
be under subject control to only a degree
and this fact is one of the factors underlying
retrieval failure
This extremely brief and superficial over
view should not be allowed to give the reader
an impression that distinguishing the auto
matic and controlled phases of retrieval is
generally a simple matter. Furthermore, the
controlled phase can be a most complex and
many-faceted process. To give just one ex
ample, Anderson and Bower (1973) consider
how subjects compare test sentences with
stored sentences in long-term memory. In
our model, there are two phases to this ex
periment: (a) a retrieval of the appropriate
informational nexus from long-term memory
through the use of probe information in
cluding the test question) and (b) a com
parison in short-term memory of the test
question and the retrieved search set. The
Anderson and Bower model, in the present
view, is primarily a model of the second of
these processes—the comparison within
short-term memory of the test sentence and
the retrieved information. See Shiffrins
(1970, 1975b, 1976) studies for a more
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
elaborate discussion of long-term retrieval
processes
V. Models of Search and Detection
In this section the theory we have pro
posed will be compared with some of the
previous models that have been proposed for
detection and search tasks
A. The Sternberg Model: Serial, Exhaustive
Search
The serial, exhaustive search model is pre
sented in Sternberg (1966). Extensions
further evidence, and reviews of the litera
ture are given in Sternberg (1969a, b
197S). This model is meant to apply to
memory search tasks (F — 1, M varies
with small memory-set sizes. It has been
confirmed impressively often but is limited
in scope, as it is meant to apply only to a
small range of paradigms. In our present
theory, serial, exhaustive search is considered
to be one of the controlled search strategies
one that is very commonly adopted
The factors that lead subjects in our situ
ation to adopt terminating, controlled search
remain uncertain at present. Possibly the
much larger search loads in our study led to
a terminating strategy. One other minor dis
crepancy in results involves the Sternberg
(1966) finding apparently showing fixed sets
(CM) and varied sets (VM) to give equiva
lent set-size functions. In retrospect we can
see that Sternberg's subjects in the fixed set
procedure were given far too little training
and the fixed sets were varied too often for
automatic detection to have developed
1. The Relation Between Sternberg's Model
and Our Framework
Reaction time was proposed by Sternberg
(1969a, 1969b) to be the sum of motor re
sponse time and the times for four additive
stages: (a) encoding (affected by stimulus
legibility), (b) serial comparison affected
by size of the memory set), (c) binary de
cision (affected by whether a positive or
negative trial has occurred), (d) translation
and response organization (affected by rela
tive frequency of positive and negative
trials). In Figure 11, in which our more
general framework is depicted, these stages
proposed by Sternberg may be placed as
follows: "Encoding" is equivalent to auto
matic encoding; "serial comparison and bi
nary decision" both are part of controlled
processing; "response organization and mo
tor response execution" are part of response
production. In conclusion, then, the Stern
berg model differs from the detailed quan
titative model we fit to our data in Part I
but nevertheless may be viewed as a special
case of our general framework
2. Problems for the Serial, Exhaustive
Comparison Model and Their Resolution
The serial, exhaustive model is particu
larly important on account of the research it
has generated that give results not consistent
with the theory in its simplest form. These
inconsistencies have led to many new models
some of which will be discussed below. The
apparent inconsistencies include the follow
ing results
1. Reaction times depend on the serial
presentation position of the tested item
within the memory set (in VM procedures
with memory sets changing every trial
The most pronounced effects occur when the
memory-set items are presented quickly and
the display item is presented very soon after
the last memory-set items (Burrows amp
Okada, 1971; Clifton & Birenbaum,
Corballis, 1967; Klatzky, Juola, & Atkin
son, 1971; Klatzky & Smith,
2. Reaction times depend on the relative
frequency of presentation of items within
the memory set in CM procedures (see Bie
derman & Stacy; Krueger, 1970; Miller amp
Pachella, 1973; Shiffrin & Schneider,
Theios et al.,
3. Reaction times can be speeded for cued
items in VM paradigms (Klatzky & Smith
1972) or speeded for expected items in CM
paradigms (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1974; but
note that the fixed sets changed every
trials so that only low degrees of practice
were involved), or speeded in a VM para
digm for an item repeated during the pre
172 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
sentation of the memory set (Baddeley amp
Ecob,
4. The outcomes in CM paradigms often
differ in fundamental ways from those in
VM paradigms, especially when some simple
physical basis separates the memory and dis
tractor sets, or when the degree of training
is high. Many such findings have been dis
cussed extensively in earlier sections of this
paper and will not be reviewed again here
5. Subjects typically give incorrect re
sponses on 1-10% of the trials, depending
upon the condition. The serial search models
do not generally posit explicit mechanisms
to predict errors
Before turning to alternative models, it is
useful to consider how these phenomena are
dealt with in the framework of our theory
and also to see how Sternberg explains the
results
The various findings in CM paradigms are
easiest to explain: Automatic detection de
velops that enables the serial search to be
bypassed. Much of the research in this paper
was directed toward establishing this fact
Sternberg (1975) is less specific but also sug
gests that some alternative, more efficient
search process is used in such situations
Within varied-mapping paradigms, re
course to the hypothesis of automatic detec
tion cannot be used to explain the results
It would be parsimonious if each of the
above findings (1) to (3) proved to be the
result of a common mechanism. Shiffrin and
Schneider (1974) proposed one possible mech
anism—namely, that when information con
cerning test probabilities is available to the
subject, then one item is placed in a special
state prior to each test display (called a
state of "expectancy"), and that a test of
the expected item results in a faster response
time than tests of nonexpected items. Stimu
lus probability, serial position, cueing, stim
ulus repetition, or differential importance
could all be expected to determine the prob
ability with which stimuli will be expected
The effects of expectancy could possibly
act at several different stages en route to the
execution of the response. One possibility
also mentioned by Sternberg (1975), is that
the comparison process is carried out in a
speeded fashion for an expected item. An
other possibility is that the encoding process
or the response production stage is speeded
when an expected item is tested. Shiffrin and
Schneider (1974) attempted to carry out a
test discriminating among the possible mod
els. While the general notion of expectancy
was supported by the results, the study was
not conclusive in determining which version
of the model was to be preferred
The important point to be emphasized is
that we (and Sternberg also) suggest that
findings (1) to (3) listed above are not in
compatible with a controlled search process
that is serial and exhaustive. We suggest these
findings can be explained by factors that af
fect other stages of the response process than
the comparison stage or perhaps by a factor
that affects the comparison process only on
certain trials. Many other researchers have
preferred to discard the hypothesis of a serial
exhaustive comparison process. Some of the
models proposed as alternatives will be dis
cussed below
The final problem for the serial, exhaustive
search model is posed by the occurrence of
errors. The explanations of controlled search
processes by Sternberg (and by us) for re
action time tasks do not propose an explicit
mechanism by which errors may occur. Many
investigators have simply ignored errors as
long as the error rate rate is low, under
say. This is perhaps justifiable if errors are
anomalous events that do not interact with
any of the other variables being studied. In
deed the stability of findings across numerous
studies that do not attempt to fix error rates
at any given value and that vary consider
ably in the observed rates (in the range
10%) lends some support to the view that
ignoring errors will not distort the conclusions
drawn from the reaction time data
In principle, however, error rates cannot
be ignored. Pachella (1974) has shown that
instructions used to change error rates by
just a few percent can cause considerable
changes in the level and pattern of reaction
times. There are many ways in which error
producing mechanisms can be appended to
controlled search models. Two of the most
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
important are as follows: First, the subject
might terminate, or be forced to terminate
the controlled search before the search is
completed. Then a response would have to
be made as a guess based on partial informa
tion at most, or perhaps no response at all
would be made (an omission). These types
of error resulting from early search termina
tion account for almost all errors in search
and attention tasks using abovethreshold
stimuli with accuracy as a measure; in par
ticular, most of the errors in the accuracy
tasks reported in the present paper and in
Part I are errors of the type. Second, the
search process might be carried out incor
rectly; that is, a comparison might be car
ried out incorrectly owing to confusions
among items, forgetting, misperception, and
the like. When error mechanisms are ap
pended to the basic search model a new ex
panded theory results, which must be tested
through joint consideration of error data and
reaction time data
Two basic approaches may be utilized to
test search theories incorporating error pre
dictions. One approach involves manipulat
ing the error rate systematically within each
condition; the manipulation may be carried
out through instruction, deadline training
or signals-to-respond (Reed, 1973). This ap
proach has the advantage of making full use
of both the error and reaction time data
from a single experiment. It has the dis
advantage that the manipulations of error
rates may affect the nature of the controlled
search strategy adopted by the subject. For
example, Reed (1976) carried out a remark
able series of tests of a wide variety of models
using data collected in the signaltorespond
procedure. Unfortunately, though one model
could be singled out in preference to the
others, the basic data differed in important
respects from those ordinarily found in the
simpler version of the same paradigm
The alternative approach involves carrying
out two separate studies involving the same
subjects. One study utilizes the usual re
action time methodology, with instructions
to keep error rates low. The second study
utilizes a paradigm in which the available
search time is systematically varied and the
error rates corresponding to each amount of
available search time are collected. The model
derived from one study can then be used to
predict the results of the other. This is the
method that was adopted in Experiments
and 2 of Part I. This approach has the ad
vantage of relating two fields of inquiry that
are normally treated separately. In the
present paper, for example, attention tasks
using accuracy as a measure were linked to
search tasks using reaction time as a measure
It should be noted, by the way, that the
type of error predicted for the results of Part
I/Experiment 1 is that caused by premature
termination of controlled search whose char
acteristics were derived from the reaction
time results of Part I/Experiment 2. How
ever, the errors seen in Part I/Experiment
were not necessarily caused by the same
mechanism. In fact many, if not most, of
them may have resulted from confusions
forgetting, or anomalous conditionindepen
dent factors
B. The Theios Model
There are really two separate treatments
to be discussed here: the specific micromodel
used by Theios et al. (1973) to predict re
sults that would otherwise be fit by a serial
exhaustive model, and the general theory
used by Theios (1973, 197S) to describe the
production of response times in a variety of
tasks
1. Serial, Terminating Search Through a List
of Memory Items and Distractors
In this model a list is constructed in mem
ory, a list on which appear all items that
might be displayed for test. Each of these
items has an associated response cue posi
tive or negative) attached to it. The memory
set items and distractors may in general be
intermingled in this list, but a variety of
factors affect list ordering, and in many cases
the memory-set items may tend to appear
early in the list. During the test, the subject
serially scans the list until the test item is
located, then terminates the search and re
sponds according to the cue information
174 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
located along with that item. A group of
items at the end of the list is assumed, how
ever, to be searched in parallel, in one step
if search has not previously terminated. These
last items are supposed to be accessed through
LTS, while those scanned serially are in STS
(There are a variety of complications and
extensions added to this model that we
shall not discuss.) In at least some situations
this model can approximately predict linear
set-size functions that are parallel for nega
tive and positive trials
Various versions of the model were fitted
to data collected by Theios et al.
They utilized a CM procedure with a moder
ate amount of training. It seems likely, there
fore, that many of the observed effects in
their study, especially those based on differ
ences in stimulus frequency, resulted from
the development of at least a small degree of
automatic detection. The more frequent items
would come to elicit automatic responses
sooner, causing the observed reduction in
response reaction times. In our terms, the
subject's strategy was probably a mixture
of automatic detection and controlled search
making simple conclusions difficult. Never
theless, even if automatic detection is not
involved, it may be asked whether models
of the complexity suggested by Theios or
suggested by the comments above) are neces
sary to fit his data. Shiffrin and Schneider
(1974) showed that a simple version of the
expectancy model using serial, exhaustive
search through the positive set could provide
a fit to the data about as good as that pro
vided by the more complex models of Theios
et al. (1973). Under these circumstances the
data do not provide strong support for the
Theios model
Aside from questions concerning the de
tails of the Theios et al. (1973) study, one
can address the more general hypothesis put
forward by these investigators. This hy
pothesis suggests that most memory search
studies are best conceived of in terms of a
(rather complex) serial, terminating search
model. Although we have collected data
arguing for a serial, terminating search
through the memory set (Experiment 2, Part
I), we agree with Sternberg (1975) that a
serial, terminating search is not a good can
didate as a model for the simpler para
digms in which linear, parallel set-size func
tions are collected (see Sternberg, 1975, for
the relevant arguments). There are many
additional reasons for us to reject the hy
pothesis of Theios et al; these reasons arise
from the results of the present paper. Bas
ically, the Theios et al. model was proposed
to deal with a variety of stimulus prob
ability effects that arise in CM paradigms
We have shown in this article that indeed a
different detection process develops in such
paradigms; however, the fully developed
automatic process and the pure controlled
process are two different mechanisms and
both are relatively simple. In effect, Theios
et al. have been led to propose a rather com
plex unitary model to try to fit data that
probably reflect a mixture of two different
simple search mechanisms
2. A Hybrid Serial-Parallel Model
A much more general theory of response
time generation in search tasks has been
presented by Theios (1973, 1975). This
theory has many similarities to the theory
presented in the present article. It postulates
input and identification stages (which we
would call automatic encoding), a response
determination stage (which in our terms is
either a controlled search or an automatic
process or some combination, depending on
the paradigm), and response program selec
tion and response output stages (which we
term response production). Theios's de
scriptions of the situations in which auto
matic processing should occur are quite sim
ilar to those we suggest in this paper. His
distinction between controlled and automatic
processing is not made as explicit as in the
present article, and in his view the use of
controlled search is tied more to stimulus
response compatibility than to the type and
amount of practice (i.e., the consistency of
the mapping). Furthermore, the details he
presents concerning controlled search pro
cesses are somewhat different and more limited
than we have presented in the present treat
ments. On the whole, however, the Theios
(1975) theory is quite compatible with the
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
general approach taken in this paper; in
fact, we suggest that interested readers read
that paper for additional evidence regarding
automatic processing in reaction time tasks
C. Parallel Processing Models
Certain parallel processing models have
been proposed for VM search paradigms as
alternatives to the usual serial models. Atkin
son et al. (1969), Murdock (1971), and
Townsend (1971) have all presented versions
of such models. The Townsend model can
serve as an example. In this model the time
to complete any one comparison is distributed
exponentially with a rate constant that de
pends on the number of current items under
going processing. When any item completes
comparison, the rates are immediately re
adjusted
Such models almost completely mimic
serial models. The same set-size predictions
are derived as for serial models, whether or
not termination of search is assumed. There
are some minor problems with these models
For example, the exponential assumption
implies a particular relation between the
growth of the mean reaction time and the
growth of the variance of the reaction time
with set size. More important, however, this
sort of parallel model is not conceptually
very different from the serial modelscom
parisons occur, on the average, at evenly
spaced intervals of time for each of the items
of the memory set (or the display set). We
prefer, therefore, to think of such models as
members of a class also containing the serial
models. As Sternberg (1966) has shown
some types of parallel models, in which each
item is processed independently of the num
ber of alternative items, cannot predict the
observed results
D. Direct Memory Access Models Based on
Trace Strength
A number of models have included a search
mechanism that resembles in certain respects
the automatic detection process presented in
this paper. In these models, an item presented
for test is encoded directly to some location
in long-term memory, a location containing
information enabling the correct response to
be given. These models are most applicable
to CM paradigms, although they have some
times been applied to VM situations and al
though some have been elaborated to contain
serial, short-term search as an additional
process. Generally, in these models the trace
strength of the code in long-term memory
determines the ease of access and the re
sponse time for a given item
Speaking generally, it is our feeling that
such models capture part of the process we
have described as automatic detection. Note
however, that the two concepts are not
identical. An example will make this point
clear. Suppose we define the memory set to
consist of all words whose fourth letter is
alphabetically prior to the second letter. A
word presented auditorally will presumably
be encoded automatically until the longterm
memory node is located that contains the
spelling. Then a controlled process will check
the spelling to see whether the criterion is
satisfied. Such a process is not automatic
detection." If several items are presented at
once, each would have to be checked serially
This is an example of a task designed so that
the information found in long-term store
corresponding to a given input is sufficient
for a decision to be made correctly, without
considering other members of the memory set
This property could hold for either VM or
CM tasks, regardless of task-specific train
ing and regardless of whether an attention or
other task-specific) response has been learned
The automatic detection mode is therefore
similar to the search mode of tracestrength
models in that each input is encoded auto
matically, and relevant information is located
in LTS. If the information located must be
processed in limited, controlled fashion so
that multiple inputs would have to be de
cided about sequentially, for example) then
we would not consider the process to be
one of automatic detection. On the other
hand, if the information located is attention
directing, or even response eliciting, then the
process would be one of automatic detection
Several varieties of trace-strength models
may be distinguished. We consider these next
176 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
1. Trace-Strength Discrimination Models
In these models, the information found in
memory for any tested item consists of a
unidimensional value of strength (often in
terpreted as familiarity). The task is de
signed so that the response can be based on
the retrieved strength value, and it is as
sumed that criteria can be chosen so that
errors are kept low in frequency. Examples
of such models are found in Corballis, Kirby
and Miller (1972) ; Nickerson (1972)
Baddeley and Ecob (1973); Cavanagh
(1973, 1976), and Anderson
There are many tasks in which we regard
a response strategy based on trace strength
to be highly plausible, whether the trace
strength is utilized in a controlled decision
or used to initiate an automatic response
But we must ask whether such models are
reasonable when applied to typical VM
search paradigms. There is no question that
the models are capable of generating ac
curate predictions if strengths for items in
variously sized memory sets are appropri
ately adjusted. However, a model with this
much freedom could predict anything and
would not be interesting. In practice, of
course, various assumptions are made to
govern the possible changes in trace strengths
across conditions. The extant models, how
ever, do not appear to us to have the sim
plicity and elegance of serial search theory
when both are applied to VM search tasks
The models of Corballis (1975) and
Cavanagh (1976) both assume that trace
strength is affected by rehearsal (called se
quential priming" by Corballis). Both models
have been developed primarily in response to
the findings of serial position effects. As
discussed earlier, such effects are not incom
patible with serial search, or even serial
exhaustive search. Thus if rehearsal affects
search in important ways it might do so
because it controls the trace strengths used
to respond (in the trace-strength models), or
because it affects serial search order (in a
terminating search), or because it affects
encoding or response time rather than com
parison time (in a serial, exhaustive model
Future research will be necessary to establish
which, if any, of these possibilities is true
2. The Atkins on-Juola Model
This model (Atkinson & Juola, 1974) was
constructed to explain the results of search
studies in which a large, previously learned
ensemble of items forms the memory set
The model assumes that the test item is
evaluated in terms of its familiarity—a value
above a criterion leads to a positive response
a value below a lower criterion leads to a
negative response, and a value between the
two criteria leads the subject to carry out a
serial search of the list. Such a model is
quite compatible with our theory as applied
to a task of this kind, but there is at least
one problem requiring further research. The
estimated serial search rate is only about
10 msec per item. If the serial search mode
were similar to that in the usual procedure
then a rate nearer 40 msec would be ex
pected. There are several hypotheses to ex
plain the discrepancy—for example, it is pos
sible that the search is somehow restricted
to a subset of items that are similar to the
test item. A somewhat different hypothesis
would suggest that no serial search occurs
at all, but that some rechecking of the
familiarity value is necessary when the first
observation is between the criteria, and that
the confusability of the test item, and hence
the need to recheck the test item, will de
pend on the list length
In paradigms like that of Atkinson and
Juola (1974), where trace strength or famil
iarity is used as a basis for the response
(thereby sometimes bypassing a serial search
it might be asked to what degree the detec
tion is an automatic process. Certainly the
encoding of the stimulus and the generation
of a familiarity value is an automatic process
The decision how to respond for a given
value of familiarity could very well be a
controlled process initially, though with suffi
cient practice in the task, the decision and
response initiation for extreme familiarity
values might also become automatized
E. Some Conclusions about Search Models
Each of the models we have considered has
some elements in common with our general
theory. At the same time, each has been
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
applied to some paradigms that we think
would be better handled by an alternative
process. The direct access tracestrength
theories, for example, have a close affinity
with our automatic detection mechanism
and have a natural application to CM para
digms, tasks with perceptual cues separating
the memory and distractor sets, or tasks in
which associations in LTS to each test item
contain information enabling a response to
be made. Such models should not, however
be applied, in our view, to VM paradigms of
the type that are usually studied in the
laboratory. For such tasks serial, controlled
search seems a more attractive possibility
(or at least limited controlled search of one
sort or another). Much of the present article
has been devoted to demonstrating that two
qualitatively different detection or search
modes exist and to establishing the conditions
under which each is utilized. Many of the
models to date have attempted, we think
unsuccessfully, to apply a single mode of
search to all the search paradigms
The second point we wish to emphasize
is that many of the prior models have been
constructed to deal with just a few studies
or just a few results from those studies. The
history of investigation in this area has
demonstrated beyond doubt that numerous
models are capable of predicting results from
any given study. A proper evaluation of
models should incorporate two tests: a
Can the model predict a wide variety of
results in differing paradigms, and can it
predict results in both the reaction time and
accuracy domain? (b) Can the model predict
results from a single series of studies on the
same subjects, a series in which most of the
commonly examined variables are manipu
lated
VI. Models of Selective Attention
A. The Broadbent and Treisman Models
The Broadbent (1971) model supposes
that there are two basic selective processes
one leading from the physical input to a set
of internal codes that serve as the evidence
and a second leading from the internal codes
to categories and responses. The selection
in Stage 1 is called "filtering" or stimulus
set," and that in State 2 is called pigeon
holing" or "response set." There is a very
short-term sensory-information store less
than 1-sec duration) called a "buffer," which
accepts information in parallel from the
physical inputs. (This store is equivalent to
the more peripheral information in STS in
our theory.) The filter selects information
from the buffer and sends it through a
limited-capacity channel. In the Broadbent
(1958) theory the filter allowed information
from only one source at a time to continue
through the system. In the theory proposed
in 1971, Broadbent's earlier view was modi
fied in accord with data put forth and theory
suggested by Treisman (e.g., 1960,
This modified theory suggests that the filter
does not block, but only attenuates, informa
tion from nonattended sources. The states of
evidence in the system are the output of the
filter
While there are obvious elements of sim
ilarity between our approach and Broad
bent's, we would like to focus on the differ
ences
1. The Role of Control Processes
In our theory, selective attention is largely
defined in terms of control processes. Selec
tivity due to structural characteristics of the
processing system, even structure that has
been learned, is not considered to be an at
tentional process. In the Broadbent model
the distinction between the structural, learned
components of selectivity and those under
subject control are not as clearly distin
guished. One consequence of Broadbent's ap
proach is that the type and amount of train
ing is not implicated as a particularly im
portant determinant of the presence or ab
sence of attentional deficits. Much of the
data in the present article, however, has
shown how the conditions of practice par
ticularly the consistency of the mapping of
attention to a feature to a reinforced out
come) determine the development of auto
maticity, the bypass of controlled search, and
the elimination of attentional limitations
The emphasis on the role of control pro
cesses in our theory also implies that we are
178 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
advocating an active rather passive view of
attentional selectivity. In our theory atten
tional selectivity is largely the result of ac
centuation of certain informational elements
through the use of control processing; in the
Broadbent-Treisman approach, on the other
hand, inhibition and attenuation of the pro
cessing of certain inputs play the most im
portant role in selectivity
2. Selectivity Leading to the Internal States
of Evidence
In our theory the internal states of evi
dence are the result of automatic processing
of sensory inputs, with subject control af
fecting sensory encoding only indirectly and
to a small degree. On the other hand, the
selectivity that results from filtering plays
a large and fundamental role in Broadbents
theory. This fact alone would not be a source
of discrepancy between the theories if these
filtering processes reflected only relatively
permanent, structural components of selec
tivity. However, the examples of filtering
given by Broadbent make it clear that this
process is intended to reflect temporary shifts
in attentional control. Thus, in numerous
studies, filtering is said to select inputs
on the basis of a physical difference, like
location. In some of these studies the same
physical cue is always assigned consistently
so that automatic detection (in our terms
could have developed, but the number of
trials is usually so small that controlled pro
cessing probably was utilized. In other of
these types of studies the physical cue was
assigned randomly across trials, so that selec
tion must have been based on temporary con
trol processes (see Broadbent, 1971, chap
S). In either class of studies, Broadbent sug
gests filtering as the basis for selection, with
attended inputs presumably resulting in a
better state of internal evidence than non
attended inputs
We take a different view. We propose that
automatic processing results in roughly
equivalent internal states, but that controlled
processing must examine these internal states
sequentially. Thus information on an at
tended channel is examined first, and is there
fore detected and recalled more effectively
than information on a nonattended channel
We will discuss below some studies by
Shiffrin and his colleagues that seem to pro
vide strong evidence in favor of this view
point
3. Short-Term Store and Levels of Processing
In the Broadbent theory there is a short
term buffer more or less corresponding to a
short-term memory for peripheral informa
tion. In the original 1958 theory this was
the sole basis for short-term memory, but in
the 1971 theory, a later short-term system
called "primary memory" was added sub
sequent to the filter and the limitedcapacity
channel. Thus the new theory is in close cor
respondence with the approach of Atkinson
and Shiffrin
However, the Broadbent theory identifies
selectivity with particular levels of processing
Selectivity operates after the buffer and prior
to primary memory. We, on the other hand
treat all short-term memory as a single con
tinuum consisting of the results of automatic
encoding as well as inputs from LTS. Thus
STS consists of information at a wide variety
of levels of processing. In our view, selec
tivity is not restricted to any special levels
Rather, selectivity operates at whatever level
controlled processing is utilizing. If con
trolled processing is checking color serially
then attentional selectivity will appear at the
peripheral level of hue, while if words are
compared serially to see which is a synonym
of a memory item, then attentional selectivity
will appear at the central semantic level
4. The Role of Timing
An important concept in Broadbents
theory is that of "switching time." Broadbent
interprets the results of many studies by
assuming that attention (the filter) may
not be redirected from one source to another
before the lapse of some minimal time, called
switching time. Although some of the results
Broadbent ascribes to switching time limita
tions are due in our theory to other mech
anisms, we have no objection to arguments
that attentional limitations are rooted in
limitations on the rate of processing opera
tions. To the contrary, we have carried this
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
argument much further and have suggested
that the time utilized during controlled pro
cessing is in many tasks the immediate
proximal cause of the inability to divide
attention. The results of Experiments 1 and
2 in Part I, and our analysis of them, were
intended to demonstrate the role of timing
by relating the accuracy of performance in
attention tasks to the reaction times produced
in search tasks
B. The Shiffrin (1975a) Model
The work by Shiffrin and his colleagues
summarized by Shiffrin (1975a) may be re
garded as a preface to the present studies and
present theory. The primary aim of the
earlier studies was a demonstration that en
coding quality is virtually unaffected by at
tentional instructions. The results from a
series of experiments demonstrated that in
formation from a source (location) is pro
cessed as well when it is the only information
requiring processing as when it arrives
simultaneously with other information also
requiring processing. If filtering or attenua
tion were occurring between stimulus input
and the production of internal states of evi
dence, then attention would have been al
located less effectively when simultaneous
inputs were used, and performance would
have suffered
It could well be argued that the results
were obtained only because attentional ca
pacity had not been exceeded. In effect, this
is our own argument. Such an argument does
not help resuscitate the views that early
filtering, attenuation, or blocking of pro
cessing takes place, since the situations in
which the results were obtained were as com
plex at the stimulus input side as most of
the studies in which attentional deficits are
found
It should be noted that the Shiffrin
(197Sa) results are easily accommodated in
Broadbent's general theory. It must be as
sumed that the various inputs are retained in
the sensory buffer long enough that they may
all be passed successfully through the limited
capacity system (in essence this is our ex
planation, also, if "sensory buffer" is replaced
by "STS"). The features in the sensory buffer
must be high-level ones, however, because in
the studies masks were used to delete low
level features from storage. Thus such results
call into question the need for two selective
processes, one before and one after genera
tion of states of internal evidence. We argue
instead that only one controlled selection
process occurs, after automatic encoding has
produced states of internal evidence. Even
if it should eventually be determined that
some small degree of selection occurs during
initial perceptual processing, the accumula
tion of data makes it clear that the magnitude
of attentional effects due to controlled pro
cessing after automatic encoding is far
greater than the magnitude of any effects due
to early selection. For further discussion see
Shiffrin & Gardner (1972), Shiffrin, Craig, amp
Cohen (1973), Shiffrin, Gardner, & Allmeyer
(1973), Shiffrin & Grantham(1974), Shiffrin
Pisoni, & Casteneda-Mendez (1974), and
Shiffrin, McKay, & Shaffer (1976). The hy
pothesis supported by these studies, that of
a single selection phase following automatic
encoding, has been proposed by a number of
researchers and theorists. We turn now to
these proposals
C. The Deutsch and Deutsch Theory
As preface to the Deutsch and Deutsch
(1963) model and to other similar theories
we will review some results in auditory selec
tive perception from shadowing or dichotic
listening tasks. Then we will consider the
Deutsch and Deutsch treatment, objections
to it, and our present view
1. Experiments on Auditory Shadowing and
Dichotic Listening
Starting with Cherry's (1953) study, nu
merous studies have utilized a shadowing
technique in which the subject repeats con
tinually a stream of speech (usually presented
to one ear) while other messages are pre
sented simultaneously (usually to the other
ear). Moray (1959) showed that information
on the nonshadowed ear could not be recalled
recognized, or relearned with savings. How
ever, the subject's own name on the non
shadowed ear could be noticed and recalled
180 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
at the end of the experiment. The traditional
explanations for such results hold that the
information presented to the nonattended ear
is greatly attenuated, but that some informa
tion, enough to let highly salient inputs be
noticed, does pass the filter. The basis for
the types of information that are noticed on
the nonshadowed ear is usually considered to
be rooted in the content of the input. The
earlier treatments supposed that simple phys
ical cues served as a basis (not only in
Broadbent, 19S8, but also in Neisser,
For example, two messages in the same voice
are confused, but if the messages are in a
man's voice and a woman's voice, then the
nonshadowed message can be ignored. A
number of studies by Treisman (see 1969 for
a review) showed that content of messages
can also serve as a basis for selection though
usually not as effectively as physical cues
2. The Deutsch and Deutsch Approach
Faced with selection on the basis of con
tent, Deutsch and Deutsch (1963) suggested
that all inputs are analyzed to a relatively
high level and that the results of the pro
cessing are then used to select certain stimuli
for further processing, for memory, and for
response. We are in essential agreement with
this view, though we have elaborated on it
considerably and introduced the important
distinction between controlled search and
learned attention responses leading to auto
matic detection
The Deutsch and Deutsch model has not
yet gained general acceptance and in par
ticular has been rejected by Broadbent
(1971) and Treisman and Riley
Within the framework of shadowing studies
several objections have been raised to the
Deutsch and Deutsch position. First, selection
without a physical cue remains difficult even
with wide variations in content. Second, dif
ferences in content affect selection very little
when a physical cue is present. Third, selec
tion of a given word in a dichotic sequence
depends on the previously attended word and
not on the previously presented, but un
attended, word
Our present theory, with its distinction be
tween controlled search and automatic detec
tion, overcomes these objections. If the stim
uli presented do not cause automaticatten
tion responses, then a controlled search situa
tion (like that of Experiment 4a) obtains
and a similar explanation holds: The subject
will carry on attention-demanding, controlled
processing primarily on the shadowed or at
tended message, with only minimal controlled
processing of the nonattended information
just enough to establish which information
is to be given deeper processing. Physical
cues, when available, will make this relevancy
decision easy. On the other hand, if auto
matic-attention responses have been pre
experimentally attached to stimuli, these
stimuli will be attended to and remembered
even when they are presented on a tobe
ignored channel. This fact explains the re
call for the subject's own name, for example
Furthermore, the objection that selection is
difficult without a physical cue does not hold
since we have shown that consistent train
ing leads to the development of automatic
attention responses even without the pres
ence of a simple, consistent physical cue
(though a great deal of training may be
necessary—see Experiments 1 and
To return to the original controversy, some
of the most persuasive evidence in favor of
the Deutsch and Deutsch position has been
the subject's ability to divide attention with
out deficit, even in VM situations when auto
matic detection could not have been operat
ing. Such data have often been discounted by
Broadbent and others on the following basis
It is argued that relatively unanalyzed in
formation is held temporarily in a sensory
buffer; thus it should not be surprising that
multiple stimuli can pass through the filter
as long as a free period exists after presenta
tion that allows the information to be passed
serially from the buffer through the filter
This argument is used to explain the ap
parent ability to analyze multiple simulta
neous stimuli in a variety of tasks and is
thereby used to discount much of the evi
dence supporting the Deutsch and Deutsch
position. Broadbent's argument, however
does not account for the results of our multi
ple-frame studies, for in these studies there
were no blank periods to allow serial process
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
ing, and yet the rate of presentation could
even be speeded under the consistent CM
training conditions. We do not disagree that
under VM conditions a postpresentation free
period will allow simultaneous inputs to be
handled serially by the attention system. We
merely wish to point out that this explanation
cannot help explain the relationship between
our VM and CM conditions in the multiple
frame tasks. Instead, Broadbent and Treis
man would have to argue that the salience of
the consistently trained targets is so high
that the filter plays no role in processing
whatsoever, in which case it might as well be
argued that automatic processing bypasses
the selective system
In summary, we argue that the position
of Deutsch and Deutsch, when extended in
the manner of our present theory, is both
fully defensible and in better accord with the
data than the opposing views
D. The Norman Model
Norman, alone and with coauthors, has
been responsible for a number of rather dif
ferent models. We consider here the version
most closely in accord with that of Deutsch
and Deutsch (Norman, 1968, 1969; see also
Lindsay & Norman, 1972). This model is
basically an extension of the Deutsch and
Deutsch approach in the sense that it pro
poses a relatively complete analysis of all in
coming stimuli. As in the Deutsch and
Deutsch approach, a mechanism is proposed
by which certain of these complete encodings
are selected for further serial processing. This
mechanism is called pertinence
In the model, each set of encodings is as
signed a value of pertinence that determines
the order of further processing. The value of
pertinence is assumed to derive from two
sources: the stimulus encoding and an anal
ysis of previous inputs. The item selected for
further analysis is that one whose pertinence
value is highest as determined by a com
bination of sensory encoding and previous
analysis. In very general terms this model is
highly similar to the theory we have proposed
However, the Norman model fails to make
the important and necessary distinction be
tween automatic-attention learning and con
trolled processing. Thus extrapolating from
Norman's theory, visual search for a single
memory item, even in a VM task, should be
almost capacity-unlimited and parallel. The
subject should, by hypothesis, raise the per
tinence value of the single item, and hence
this item should be processed first. However
all of our studies have demonstrated that
such pertinence changes cannot take place on
a trial-by-trial basis. It is only after con
siderable CM training that an automatic
attention response develops (or, in Normans
terms, that pertinence is raised). Thus a sub
ject may wish to find a particular stimulus
but does not in general have the attentional
control to enable the stimulus to be located
without a serial, limited, controlled search
E. The Neisser Model
Neisser (1967) has proposed a general
model that postulates an early stage of par
allel processing not under subject control
called "preattentive" (similar to our sys
temic, automatic stage), and a later, controll
able, serial stage referred to by the term
"focal attention." In many respects this gen
eral approach is quite similar to the present
treatment. For example, Neisser discusses in
some detail the fact that preattentive pro
cesses can control attention or responses as
in eye movements). Furthermore, it is sug
gested that practice can lead to search be
coming dependent on preattentive mecha
nisms, and hence lead detection to become
automatic
Neisser's own treatment of his visual search
data differed in some respects from our present
treatment. For example, Neisser argued that
irrelevant targets in CM designs are not pro
cessed in as much detail as relevant targets
We argue that automatic analysis is equal
but that attention is drawn to the relevant
targets. Furthermore, there are some differ
ences in emphasis between Neisser's and our
models. For example, Neisser tends to em
phasize that preattentive discriminations are
based on relatively crude physical differ
ences among stimuli, whereas we feel pre
attentive" processes are determined by
conditions of training and practice, with phys
ical differences affecting the rate of develop
182 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
ment of automaticity. However, such differ
ences should not be allowed to mask the
similarity of the general approaches
F. The LaBerge Model
LaBerge (1973, 1975) presents an atten
tional model, in the context of reaction time
matching tasks, that has many elements in
common with the present theory. He sup
poses, like Deutsch and Deutsch, that there
exists an automatic, learned encoding system
that operates in parallel on input stimuli and
produces features independently of controlled
attentive processing. Depending on prior
learning, there are no limits to the depth of
such processing. Subsequent to such auto
matic encoding, controlled processing re
quiring attention is necessary to carry out
further analyses of the input. The features
resulting from automatic encoding are as
sumed to be capable of calling attention to
themselves. LaBerge proposes, and demon
strates empirically, that new automatic en
codings, that is, perceptual learning, may
occur with practice. Finally, LaBerge em
phasizes that perceptual learning takes place
mainly after high accuracy is achieved. All of
these aspects of the system are quite similar
to ours
One additional element of the LaBerge
model holds that attention may be directed
toward a not-yet-learned feature, causing it
to act temporarily as an automatically learned
unit, but only while attention is maintained
That is, a feature that would normally re
quire extended controlled processing to be
encoded from automatically activated, sim
pler subunits, can, when attention is focused
on it in advance, be activated by the per
ceptual encoding process. This suggests at
least some degree of control over encoding
While we have downplayed the role of such
control, we have not ruled it out. In fact
we suggested that the results from Part I
Experiment 2, when M was equal to 1, might
well be explained by such a mechanism
If there is a difference between our ap
proach and LeBerge's, it lies in the different
areas of applications and the completeness
of the assumptions. For example, we have
elaborated on the conditions of training that
determine the ability of features to attract
attention. That is, we have shown how the
attention-attracting ability of features de
pends on the use of consistent-mapping train
ing procedures
On the whole, our model and LaBerges
agree when applied to the same data. Thus
although the two theories have been built
on somewhat different data bases, they are
consistent even to the degree that there are
similarities in the diagrammatic representa
tions (compare our Figures 11 and 12 with
the depictions of the model in LaBerge,

Let us now return to models that are in
basic agreement with the BroadbentTreis
man view, as opposed to the Deutsch and
Deutsch view
G. The Kahneman Theory
Kahneman (1973) proposes a rather ex
tensive theory and reviews the literature in
considerable detail. We cannot begin to do
justice to his overall system in the limited
space available and will therefore discuss
only a few general features. Kahneman pro
poses a general theory of the allocation of
capacity according to a factor called effort
In our terms, he is concerned with the general
limits on controlled processing: How can
control be allocated? Can total capacity
vary? What types of operations can be car
ried out together with what losses of
efficiency
Interpreting our theory in Kahnemans
terms, one would say that we have proposed
a specific time-based theory determining con
trolled processing capacity in detection tasks
and that our theory gives a set of rules or
9 One must take care to distinguish the Neisser
(1967) view of attention from the Neisser
view of cognitive processing in general. The general
view emphasizes the constructivist aspects of per
ception, sometimes known as "top-down" processing
in which perception is heavily influenced at all
stages by the subject's expectations and general
knowledge. The essence of this general view seems
to be a bit incompatible with the notion of an
initial automatic processing system that is fixed
permanent, and largely unaffected by higher level
controlled processing
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
strategies by which subjects reallocate their
processing in such tasks. Such a timebased
theory is not specifically given by Kahneman
Furthermore, in Kahneman's theory there are
many results taken to indicate a change in
allocatable capacity, a change often deter
mined by changes in effort. We feel that
some of these findings are better explained by
recourse to the hypothesis that automatic
processing has developed. As we have argued
in this paper, the development of automatic
processing provides a means of improving
performance independently of the effort put
into controlled processing. In fact, the effort
required is usually greatly reduced by the
development of automatic processing even
though performance improves
There is one other important specific area
of difference between Kahneman's theory
and ours. In common with a number of the
theories we have described (i.e., Broadbent
Kahneman's assumes that control of alloca
tion affects processing prior to the stage at
which features indicating recognition are ac
tivated. We have dealt with this issue at
length and will not repeat the arguments
but we feel that control does not operate at
this point in the midst of what we call auto
matic processing (except in certain special
cases, such as instances where the inputs are
degraded or ambiguous, in which case auto
matic encoding never reaches the recognition
stage
Reversing the emphasis, it may be asked
what elements in Kahneman's approach are
not considered in our theory. The principal
such element is the entire concept of effort
We have confined ourselves to tasks in which
we assume effort is continually maintained
at the highest possible level. Of course it
must be true that performance will drop
when effort drops to a low enough level, but
our theory has not addressed this question
at all. It is natural, however, for us to assume
that changes in effort will affect controlled
processing but not automatic processing
H. The Norman and Rumelhart Model
The attentional features of this model
(Norman & Rumelhart, 1970) derive largely
from Rumelhart's (1970) article. This model
is aimed to describe visual detection in
threshold tasks. It differs from many previous
models in that it is quantitative and hence
makes explicit, testable predictions. It makes
a key assumption that the number of features
abstracted, and the rate of features ab
stracted, from a given input stimulus will be
inversely related to the total number of items
simultaneously presented. That is, attention
must be shared (i.e., divided) among multiple
inputs, even at the earliest stages of pro
cessing. The simultaneous-successive studies
by Shiffrin and Gardner (1972), described
earlier, most clearly show that this assump
tion is false. The features abstracted are
of equivalent worth whether or not the in
puts are successive or simultaneous. As we
have seen in the present article, the difficulties
in dividing attention arise later, during con
trolled processing, subsequent to the en
coding of features
I, Classification Models for Attentional
Paradigms
A number of investigators have provided
useful and interesting classifications of at
tentional paradigms. One example is a classi
fication of types of attentional limitations
by Norman and Bobrow (197S). In general
Norman and Bobrow suppose that inputs
may be given limited processing for either of
two reasons: "data-limitations" and re
source-limitations." In our terms, datalimita
tions refer to the performance-reducing inter
actions that occur during automatic encoding
for example, a signal is heard better in quiet
than in a background of white noise. Resource
limitations refer to the kind of attention
limitations that we would classify as the
result of controlled processing. Norman and
Bobrow argue that many authors have given
insufficient thought to the source of the per
-formance limitations observed in their tasks
They argue that many tasks can be varied
parametrically (quantitatively) so that data
limitations occur under some conditions and
resource limitations under other conditions
We agree fully with these arguments; our
studies have, we think, spanned the range of
these limitations and demonstrated these
points quite clearly
184 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
Many other investigators have provided
classifications of attentional paradigms and
results. The Treisman (1969) review, for
example, is largely atheoretical and classifies
a variety of paradigms and tasks with a view
toward indicating the types of attention re
striction that occur in each. Similarly Moray
(1969a, 1969b) has classified attentional
studies and paradigms. Unfortunately, the
variety of results and the experimenters
ability to design new tasks seem to have
grown about as fast as the growth in com
plexity of the classifications. Thus as useful
as these classifications have been, they have
been limited to a posteriori descriptions
J. Other Models
The brief summary of a number of theories
given above by no means exhausts the field
Keele (1973) and Hochberg (1970) pre
sented models like that of Deutsch and
Deutsch and generally similar to ours. Im
portant and influential reviews, with con
siderable theoretical import, have been
written by Egeth (1967), Moray a
1969b),Lindsay (1970), and Swetsand Krist
offerson (1970). Important research has been
carried out by Eriksen and his associates
(e.g., Eriksen Si Collins, 1969; Eriksen amp
Eriksen, 1974; Eriksen & Hoffman,
Eriksen & Rohrbaugh, 1970) and by Posner
and his associates (e.g., Posner & Boies
1971; Posner & Snyder, 1975). Although
space limitations preclude our reviewing
this work, we feel that the models we have
discussed above represent a cross section of
typical approaches that have been put for
ward for tasks that resemble those in this
paper
We would like to finish this discussion of
alternative approaches by considering very
briefly the relation of our theory to those
arising in the fields of animal discrimination
learning and attention (e.g., see Mackintosh
1975; Sutherland & Mackintosh, 1971). We
feel that data and theory in the human and
infrahuman areas are in much closer accord
than previous work might lead one to believe
There has been a tendency to compare at
tentional models deriving from controlled
processing effects in varied-mapping studies
in humans to models deriving from auto
matic-attention learning in consistentmap
ping paradigms in animals. The results in the
present article should make it clear that such
a correspondence will fail. In fact, however
it is becoming clear that a comparison of
VM with VM, and CM with CM, studies in
the two areas reveals similar findings. To
give just one example, Riley and Leith
(1976) review some paradigms in which ani
mals are forced to utilize what we term con
trolled processing; in such cases they reveal
capacity limitations and attentional control
roughly similar to that found in human sub
jects (see also Mackintosh, 1975, and
Wagner, 1976, for discussions of related
matters
K. Summary
Many of the elements constituting our
theory may be found in previous proposals
There are certain themes, which have re
curred in earlier theories, about which we
take a particular position
1. Control oj processing during encoding
and feature abstraction. We argue that con
trol is minimal, that subject-controlled filter
ing, blocking, or attenuating does not occur
during this stage but subsequent to per
ceptual encoding
2. The role oj crude physical differences in
leading to automatic discrimination. We argue
that the conditions of training are crucial to
the development of automatic processing and
automatic detection; the nature of physical
differences among items is of secondary im
portance theoretically, though it may in
practice be important in determining the
rate of acquisition and levels of perform
ance during acquisition
3. The limitations on, and capacity oj, con
trolled processing. We have presented a
specific, detailed model in which limitations
on rate of processing determine the con
trolling system's capacity
On the one hand, our theory may be seen
as both a specification and extension of views
proposed in various earlier models. On the
other hand, our theory is grounded in a
PERCEPTUAL LEARNING AND AUTOMATIC ATTENDING
much firmer empirical foundation (i.e., Ex
periments 1-3 of Part I, and 1-4 of Part II
than the previous proposals, encompasses a
greater breadth than some of the earlier
views, and states its assumptions precisely
enough that at least in our standard paradigm
and in a number of others as well, predic
tions can be made in advance of experimental
manipulations. Perhaps most important, we
have, in Part I, taken steps toward quantita
tively linking attentional phenomena and
search mechanisms, and have thereby tied
together two important fields of inquiry
attention and search—that have too often
been treated separately in previous models
VII. Summary and Conclusions
The studies reported in this article were
designed to test and extend the ideas pre
sented in Part I. In Part I we showed that
controlled search is utilized in variedmapping
search paradigms and that automatic detec
tion is utilized in consistent-mapping search
paradigms. These findings obtained in both
multiple-frame tasks measuring accuracy and
in single-frame tasks measuring reaction time
The VM results in both types of tasks were
fitted by a quantitative model assuming
serial, terminating search, with comparisons
cycling through the frame for each memory
set item
The experiments in the present article were
designed to examine the learning and unlearn
ing of automatic detection, the role of cate
gorization, and the learning of automatic at
tending. A summary of the main findings are
given below
Experiment 1 was carried out to study the
development of automatic processing. Auto
matic detection for Letter Set 1 in a back
ground of Letter Set 2 developed over several
thousand training trials during which time
performance improved considerably. Then the
two sets were reversed and performance not
only deteriorated sharply but dropped below
the level obtaining at the start of training
when controlled search was being utilized
The results showed that
1. Automatic detection could develop when
the memory and distractor sets were not pre
experimentally categorized
2. The learning of an automaticattention
response is a long-term phenomenon greatly
resistant to change (since many more trials
were needed to recover to a given perform
ance level after reversal than to reach that
level in initial training
3. The presence among the distractors of
items that automatically attract attention
harms the subject's ability to carry out a
controlled search (since postreversal per
formance dropped below initial performance
levels
4. Eventually automatic-attention responses
can be "unlearned" and new sets of auto
matic responses learned, but only after con
siderable amounts of retraining
Experiment 2 was carried out to test the
effects of reversal when the two sets in
volved were well-known categories. In Ex
periment 2, the subjects who had been trained
extensively to search for digits in a back
ground of consonants (or vice versa) were
reversed in a fashion similar to that used in
Experiment 1. The results showed
1. Performance in a VM condition after
reversal was identical to that in normal VM
controlled search, even though all items pre
sented were from the previous CM target cate
gory. Hence, when all items have equally
strong automatic-attention responses, these
either "cancel each other out" or can be
ignored, and normal controlled search takes
place
2. A reversal of memory and distractor
sets for the CM conditions reduced perform
ance almost to chance levels. This result
shows that the phenomenon of automatic
detection is not due to the presence of a
categorical difference between memory and
distractor sets, since a distinction between
letters and numbers was still available after
reversal
3. The pattern of results after reversal in
dicated that a controlled search was being
utilized, but one that compared the category
of each input to the memory-set category
in a single operation. The results suggest that
categories do improve search performance
but do so by facilitating controlled search
186 RICHARD M. SHIFFRIN AND WALTER SCHNEIDER
Experiment 3 was designed to test directly
the role of categories in the development of
automatic detection and the operation of
controlled search. It was shown that in VM
conditions, category learning for arbitrary
visually confusable sets of letters eventually
took place after 25 sessions of training. At
this point, controlled search was still being
used, but the comparison process had switched
from individual items to categories as a
whole (memory-set size had no effect
However, when training was then switched
to a CM procedure, performance improved
radically and automatic detection was learned
The results suggest that
1. Both categories and automatic responses
can be learned for arbitrarily constituted
visually confusable character sets
2. The role of categories is to improve con
trolled search, and possibly to speed the
acquisition of automatic detection
As a group, Experiments 1, 2, and 3 pro
vided a convincing demonstration of the
qualitatively different characteristics of con
trolled search and automatic detection
Experiment 4 was designed to test the sub
jects' ability to focus attention in the face
of distraction by (a) neutral characters, b
current targets in to-be-ignored display posi
tions, (c) items in to-be-ignored positions
that subjects had been trained previously to
respond to with automatic-attention re
sponses. The results showed that controlled
search can usually be directed to locations
that the subject desires to attend to but that
automatic-attention responses can overwhelm
the controlled processing system and can
cause attention to be allocated to positions
that should be ignored. Thus automaticatten
tion responses cannot be ignored and will
interrupt and redirect ongoing controlled
processing
The attention literature as a whole was
considered, and in light of our results the
following rules were suggested
1. Divided-attention deficits arise from
limitations on controlled processing. In par
ticular, detection deficits are due to the
limited rate of the serial comparison process
2. Dividing attention is possible when the
targets have been consistently mapped during
training until automatic detection operates
3. Focused-attention deficits arise when the
distracting stimuli initiate automaticatten
tion responses
4. Focusing attention is possible during
controlled processing (e.g., in VM tasks
We shall conclude by summarizing briefly
the progress we feel has been made in organ
izing the phenomena of detection, search
attention, and perceptual learning. One of
the greatest contributions of the work is the
fact that all these areas have been tied both
empirically and theoretically to each other
and to common mechanisms. Another im
portant contribution is the delineation of
the differences between, and the character
istics of, automatic and controlled processing
We make no claims that these experiments
have concluded the study of these areas
Quite to the contrary, one of the most im
portant results of this work is the host of new
questions that can now be phrased, and we
hope, answered
