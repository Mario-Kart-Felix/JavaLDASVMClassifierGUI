K. Khosla, Carnegie Mellon Univ.No abstract available653802, Session 2Secret communication by using data hiding in IPv6M. Carli, A. De Castro, A. Neri, Univ. degli Studi di Roma Tre ItalyIn this paper the use of Internet Protocol v.6 packets to convey hiddeninformation is exploited. The possibility to hide information in commonlyused data transport mechanisms allows one to send extra informationin a transparent way in such a way that no one, apart from the intendedrecipient, is aware of the existence of the message. The hiddenmessage does not affect the routing mechanism neither interferes withthe security mechanisms implemented on IP based networks, asfirewalls, intrusion detection systems, authentication tools.The objective of this paper is twofold first we demonstrate thepossibility of hiding data by using header manipulation of IPv6 InternetProtocol version 6  RFC 2460, then, we apply this technique to theauthentication mechanism between two nodes of an ad hoc wirelessnetwork. This work starts from D. Kundur, K. Ahsan, Pratical DataHiding in TCPIP,  ACM Workshop on Multimedia Security, 2002, inwhich the existence of the covert channels in IPv4 and data hidingpossibilities are demonstrated.From that analysis  of IPv6,  we have selected a field of the IPv6 packetheader that is not optional and that, at the same time, it does notinterfere with the normal routing operations. The details and the resultswill be reported in the final version of the paper.In brief, we selected the 20bits Flow Label field is used by a sourcenode for labeling the packets of a stream. That is, the field value is 0 ifthe packet does not belong to a flow if the packet is part of a flowbetween two users, than it assumes the same value for all the packetsbelonging to  the stream. If a packet fragmentation occurs, the value ofthis  field is the same for each fragment, and the Identification field ispresent in the Fragmentation Header. So we force the fragmentation ofthe flow.As an example of practical application of the proposed scheme, weconsidered the shared key authentication procedure in an ad hocnetwork.653803, Session 2Innovative, wearable snap connector technology forimproved device networking in electronic garmentsK. Lee, E. Gans, T. P. Jannson, Physical Optics Corp.This paper discusses a wearable snap connector technology thatprovides for the transfer of data and power throughout an electronicgarment egarment. These connectors resemble a standard garmentbutton and can be mated blindly with only one hand.  Fully compatiblewith military clothing, their application allows for the networking ofmultiple electronic devices and an intuitive method for addingremovingexisting components from the system. The attached flexible cablingalso permits the rugged snap connectors to be fed throughout thestandard webbing found in military garments permitting placement inany location within the uniform. Variations of the snap electronicsgeometry allow for integration with USB 2.0 devices, RF antennas, andare capable of transferring high bandwidth data streams such as the221 Mbps required for VGA video. With the trend towards providingmilitary officers with numerous electronic devices i.e., heads p display,GPS receiver, PDA, POCs snap connector technology will greatlyimprove cable management resulting in a less cumbersome uniform. Inaddition, with electronic garments gaining widespread adoption in thecommercial marketplace, POCs technology is finding applications inareas such as sporting good manufacturers and video gametechnology.653804, Session 2Enterprise network intrusion detection and preventionsystem ENIDPSC. M. Akujuobi, N. K. Ampah, Prairie View AM Univ.Securing Enterprise networks has so far been considered under twobroad topics i. e. Intrusion Detection Systems  IDS and IntrusionPrevention Systems  IPS. It has been proven that the rightcombination of selected algorithmstechniques under both topicsalways produces better security for a given network. This approachleads to using layers of physical, administrative, electronic, andencrypted system to protect valuable resources.So far, there is no algorithm, which guarantees absolute protection for agiven network from intruders. Intrusion Prevention Systems like IPSec,Firewall, Sender ID, Domain Keys Identified Mail DKIM etc. do notguarantee absolute security just like existing Intrusion DetectionSystems. Our approach focuses on developing an IDS, which willdetect all intruders that bypass the IPS and at the same time will beused in updating the IPS, since the IPS fail to prevent some intrudersfrom entering a given network.The new IDS will employ both signaturebased detection and anomalydetection as its analysis strategy. It should therefore be able to detectknown and unknown intruders or attacks and further isolate thosesources of attack within the network. Both realtime IDS predictions andoffline IDS predictions will be applied under the analysis and responsestages. The basic IDS architecture will also involve both centralized anddistributedheterogeneous architecture to ensure effective detection.Proactive responses and corrective responses will also be employedhere.The new security system, which will be made up of both IDS and IPS,should be less expensive to implement compared to existing ones.Finally, limitations of existing security systems have to be eliminatedwith the introduction of the new security system.653805, Session 2Securing wireless sensor systemsM. Blaser, Certicom Inc. CanadaData acquisition through wireless sensor systems enables remotemonitoring and surveillance tracking and tagging technologies forpeople, containers, vehicles and individual or aggregate assets andphysical security applications, providing data for diagnosis andresponse to alarms or events.  These systems also provide mechanismsfor communication, command, and control in systems designed forprotection of infrastructure. The absence of wires opens possibilities fordynamic but also less secure networking environments, which aresusceptible to sniffing, hacking, sabotage and operator error.To secure networks and improve reliability, system and device designersemploy strong authentication, key exchange, encryption and accesscontrol. This requires enabling provable identity in devices, usingpublickey cryptography. Publickey methods distribute securitycapabilities into individual devices, allowing the use of strong securitypolicies across the network. These security policies define how devicesare admitted to physical and logical networks, how they are allowed tomove between networks and communicate at geographically separate4 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsslocations, and how applications may interact.We describe how authentication, key exchange and encryption can beefficiently designed into constrained sensor devices and how digitalcertificates provide a root of trust, facilitating decisionmaking fornetwork access and authorization to participate in applications. Inaddition, we describe how these efficient security methods can meetstringent government requirements for military and homeland securityapplications, even in highly constrained devices, including the use ofSuite B cryptographic algorithms.653806, Session 2An integrated wireless sensor network for tranporattionsafety and securityM. A. Chowdhury, Clemson Univ.Ensuring that the American highway transportation system remains aviable part of the nations infrastructure is of paramount importance.Increasing population, growing numbers of vehicles, the threat ofterrorism, and urban sprawl have impacted a highway system alreadyoverburdened and inadequately maintained. Given the anticipatedincreases in highway traffic, the problems in traffic infrastructuremanagement and security will continue to grow. Therefore, it is criticalto develop systems to manage this expected growth in the surfacetransportation system efficiently. The integrated sensor networkpresented in this paper distributes management and control of highwayoperations to manage growth and contribute to security by using stateoftheart intelligent sensor technology for realtime traffic managementand control. This integrated sensor network can work with any existingtraffic sensors including the transmissionbased optical sensor systemdeveloped by the first author of this paper. The research addressedthree objectives for developing this integrated sensor network The creation of distributed decisionmaking algorithms. Distributeddecision making through collaboration between traffic sensors improveexisting centralized response and control actions. Realtime trafficmanagement can dramatically improve traffic safety and operations,and transportation security. Establishment and evaluation of a wireless network by exploiting thetemporal and spatial structures of message exchanges. A wirelesssensor network for traffic management will result from thecommunication structure requirements identified. Appropriate networkprotocols are incorporated to facilitate operations with enhancedefficiency and assured quality of service. Development of an integrated simulation platform. An experimentalsimulation test bed to demonstrate and evaluate the integrated sensorsystem is developed. The results generated from the simulation test bedare included in this paper.This integrated wireless sensor network can transform surfacetransportation operations and improve security. The redundantdistributed decision making for transportation infrastructuremanagement will provide revolutionary protection against possibleterrorist disruptions of transportation systems. This prototypical trafficregulation system, using a hierarchical wireless network architecturethat does not currently exist, can replace the traditional model of trafficcontrol characterized by wired connections or wireless base stations inwhich sensors send all measurements to control centers. The proposedsystem offers a collaborative model of wireless nodes that canindependently measure traffic conditions on local segments and initiaterobust control actions during any emergency events or security threats.653807, Session 2iScoutTM lowcost adhoc networked sensorenhancementsM. A. Winston, McQ, Inc.McQ has developed a family of  state of the art miniaturized low costunattended ground sensors UGS. The iScoutTM sensors are designedfor indoor and outdoor intrusion detection and battle damageassessment. McQ has developed a very advanced second version ofthis sensor that is a very flexible platform capable of performing in avariety of applications. This latest version has enhanced processing,added memory, and improved sensor transducers. Sensors areequipped with mesh radios, GPS, and integrated seismic, acoustic,infrared, and magnetic transducers. Typical sensor sizes are similar tothat of a deck of playing cards. Intended for high volume production,these are tactically useful sensors that can be manufactured in highvolumes for a projected cost of less than 100 each. This paper willprovide an overview of iScoutTM sensor systems, features, andperformance.653808, Session 3Experiments on throughthewall motion detection andrangingP. Setlur, M. G. Amin, F. Ahmad, Villanova Univ. P. D. Zemany, BAESystems North AmericaSingle frequency Doppler radars cannot be used in range estimationdue to their range ambiguities. An additional frequency can be used toincrease the maximum unambiguous range to accepted values forindoor range estimation of moving targets. The dualfrequency CWradar employs two different carrier frequencies and simultaneouslymeasures the phase change with respect to time, for each of the twofrequencies. It uses phase comparison of the transmitted and receivedCW signals to provide an estimate of the target range. It can functionwell in highly cluttered indoor scenes. The dualfrequency approachoffers the benefit of reduced complexity, fast computation time, and realtime target tracking. In this paper, we present experimental resultsshowing the effectiveness of the proposed method for indoor rangeestimation. Targets undergoing different motions, such as constantDoppler, microDoppler, and accelerating profiles, behind concrete wallswill be considered. The experiments include generating the Dopplersignatures for human walking showing acceleration and decelerationpatterns, and also the microDoppler signatures of typical indoor simpleharmonic motions, such those associated with pendulums and fans.653809, Session 3Throughthewall sensor systems based on hard xrayimaging opticsT. P. Jannson, M. Gertsenshteyn, V. Grubsky, P. Amouzou, PhysicalOptics Corp.In this paper, a new approach to Xray nonintrusive inspection isdiscussed, based on hard Xray imaging optics. A new Xray lens,called lobstereyelens LEL is a transmission lens, based on reflectionoptics, with grazingangle deflection of 0.2 degrees, with photon energyin the range of 40100keV. The lens reflection optics is based on largehighquality Xray mirrors, with r.m.s. lower than 1nm. The throughthewall inspection capability of such a system can be applied for longerranges up to 100m in the air, and thick walls over 1cm for wood, andover 2mm for metal. A number of CONOPS examples is discussed forhomeland security applications.653810, Session 3THz identification of humans and concealed weapons forlaw enforcement, government, and commercialapplicationsA. U. Sokolnikov, Visual Solutions and ApplicationsDescribed is the principle of the THz sensing and its implementationbased on a newly discovered possibility in a subvisible range topenetrate through various materials and to be absorbed by them to avarious extent. The advantage of the proposed solution stems from agreater degree of mobility of the sensor and its ability to distinguishbetween different materials, the feature not attainable by the XRayapparatus. The identification may be also more diplomatic since itConf. 6538 Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications,and Intelligence C3I Technologies for Homeland Securityand Homeland Defense VI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 5does not involve seeing through.

E. Borek, J. F. Seif, D. L. Stevens, D. E. Warren, Air ForceResearch Lab.The Air Force Research Laboratorys Information Directorate AFRLIFhas established the ConcealedWeapons DetectionThrough Wall Surveillance Test  Evaluation CWDTWS TE Facility to accomplish indepth analysis of developedtechnologies applicable to these identified Law Enforcement LEoperational and situational functional capabilities requirements.  Thetechnology prototypes in existence have been developed primarilythrough direct support from the Department of Justice DOJ, NationalInstitute of Justice NIJ Office of Science  Technology OST.Additionally, Statements Of Need SON from US National and State LEagencies, along with market indicators, have driven other commercialinstitutions to research and investigate the feasibility of adapting theirtechnology applications for utilization to address the CWD andor TWSchallenges.This CWDTWS TE Facility is capable of performing TE on alltechnologies that have been proposed to accomplish these functions.The current technology focuses are  for CWD, passive and acousticoperations for TWS, active radio frequency RF and acousticoperations.  However, this TE facility can be easily adapted foranalysis of other technology application prototypes.The presentation and accompanying paper will highlight the uniquecapabilities of this facility.

The differentdevices available and scheduled for testing will be discussed, as well asthe operational requirements against which each will be evaluated.Results from the TE will be used to recommend howwhenwhere eachdevice can be most effectively used.653883, Session 3Biometric identification using holographic radar imagingtechniquesD. L. McMakin, D. M. Sheen, T. E. Hall, H. P. Foote, PacificNorthwest National Lab.Pacific Northwest National Laboratory researchers have been at theforefront of developing innovative screening systems to enhancesecurity and provide customfit clothing that utilize holographic radarimaging techniques.  Award winning and firstofakind cylindricalholographic imaging systems have been developed to screen people atsecurity checkpoints for the detection of concealed, body worn, nonmetallic threats such as plastic and liquid explosives, knifes andcontraband.  One embodiment of this cylindrical security scan is able toobtain full sized body measurements in near real time without theperson under surveillance removing their outer garments.   Radarsignals readily penetrate clothing and reflect off the water in skin.  Thisfull body measurement system is used commercially for best fittingready to wear clothing, which was the first biometric application forthis technology.  One compelling feature of this technology for biometricapplications is that it can see effectively through disguises and bodyhair.  This paper will discuss the holographic radar imaging technologyfor biometric applications and present numerous imaging results.653812, Session 4A realtime tracking system for monitoring shipments ofhazardous materialsM. W. Humphrey, NorthWest Nuclear, LLC P. C. Womble, J.Paschal, L. Hopper, Western Kentucky Univ. D. Pinson, F. J.Schultz, NorthWest Nuclear, LLCDue to the ever increasing use of radioactive materials in daytodayliving e.g. the treatment of cancer patients, the irradiation of food forpreservation, and the use of industrial radiography to check for defectsin the welding of pipelines and buildings there is a growing concernover the tracking and monitoring of these materials in transit prior touse as well as the waste produced by such use.  The prevention of lostsealed radioactive materials is important in reducing the environmentaland health risk posed by direct exposure, comingling in the metalrecycling stream, use in contaminated consumer products, and use interrorist activities.Northwest Nuclear, LLC NWN and the Applied Physics Institute APIat Western Kentucky University have developed a tracking technologycalled PrecisionTraxTM using active radio frequency identificationRFID tags.  The system can track and graphically display the locationon maps, drawings or photographs of tagged items on any 802.11compliant device PDAs, laptops, computers, WiFi telephones.  Thislocation information would be vital for tracking the location of high levelradiological sources while in transit.  RFID technology would reduce thenumber of lost sources by tracking them from origination to destination.In 2005, Oak Ridge National Laboratory ORNL tested this technologyby setting up monitoring stations along the prescribed route ofshipments of radiological material between ORNL and Oak RidgeAssociated Universities.  We will discuss the results of this test alongwith the lessons learned while implementing the system within thenetwork of a national laboratory.653813, Session 4Associated particle imagingK. Warman, S. Thordarson, D. T. Kuo, D. G. Penn, M. Clements,Applied Signal Technology, Inc.Detection of concealed explosives is a critical capability in a variety ofapplications including entry point screening, cargo inspection, andthreat confirmation. The Associated Particle Imaging technique offerstremendous potential as a nonintrusive inspection method capable ofproviding throughbarrier, threedimensional target imaging, andmaterial classification.  The Associated Particle Imaging ExplosiveDetection System APIEDS was developed by Applied SignalTechnology AST to meet the threat posed by concealed, vehicle borneexplosives. Associated Particle Imaging technology is an active neutronprobe technique that provides elemental compositions of materials,including explosives and other contraband, by means of gamma rayspectroscopy. A key advantage of this technology over traditionalradiography is that access to both sides of a vehicle or container is notneeded all of the inspection equipment may be placed to one side ofan object. Barrier materials may be metal, and as well as wood anddrywall. Also, objects hidden inside or behind such barriers as pipes,boxes, drums, and boxes can be inspected without rotating either thedetectors or the objects under investigation. The operational field ofview is 60 degrees full width for the APIEDS system. System sensitivityallows for the detection of a cubic foot or more of the threat material.653814, Session 4Directional gammaray detectionK. Warman, J. Weckel, D. G. Penn, M. Clements, Applied SignalTechnology, Inc.The mishandling or intentional misuse of highly radioactive materialsposes a public threat. There are scenarios where security, lawenforcement, and safety agencies may need to locate such materialsConf. 6538 Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications,and Intelligence C3I Technologies for Homeland Securityand Homeland Defense VI6 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssefficiently and rapidly in order to direct personnel. Threats not onlycome from terrorists attempting to weaponize such materials, but alsofrom accidents or improper handling of medical or industrial materials.In one case, the negligent handling of medical materials a 2 inchCesium137 source of activity 1400 Curies in Goiania, Brazil lead toboth fatalities and injuries after scavengers looking for scrap metal stolethe material in September 1987. Traditionally, a search for suchmaterials would rely on equipment such as Geiger counters that onlyindicate the intensity of gamma radiation and not the direction back tothe source  prolonging the search. The K9Gamma system developedby Applied Signal Technology provides line of sight direction to gammaray sources in an operationally straightforward way. The systemintegrates a 360 degree panoramic camera with several gamma raydetectors. The display to the operator graphically indicates on thepanoramic photograph where in the scene gamma radiation is comingfrom. The gamma ray direction finding is based on the Comptonscattering between detectors, with a capability to show direction within15 degrees. Achievable distance varies with the level of radioactivity ofthe source a line of sight to sources such as the medical material in theGoianai incident could be determined in 1 minute at a distance of 1mile.653815, Session 5Aerostat acoustic payload for transient and helicopterdetectionM. V. Scanlon, C. G. Reiff, L. Solomon, Army Research Lab.The Army Research Laboratory ARL has conducted experiments usingacoustic sensor arrays suspended below tethered aerostats to detectand localize transient signals from mortars, artillery and small arms fire.This persistant surveillance can have a powerful effect on thesurvivability and lethality of our soldiers.  The airborne acoustic sensorarray calculates an azimuth and elevation to the originating transient,and immediately cues a collocated imager to capture the remainingactivity at the site of the acoustic transient.  This single arrays vectorsolution defines a groundintersect region or grid coordinate for threatreporting. Unattended ground sensor UGS systems can augmentaerostat arrays by providing additional solution vectors from severalgroundbased acoustic arrays to perform a 3D triangulation on a sourcelocation.  The aerostat arrays advantage over ground systems is that itis not as affected by diffraction and reflection from manmadestructures, trees, or terrain, and has direct lineofsight to most events.The same aerostat and UGS collaboration can track nearby helicoptersin 3D for tether avoidance.  Elevating the array gives an significantlylonger range of detections under favorable MET conditions.653816, Session 5Electronic system for deactivation of clockbombs withhelp of liquid nitrogenA. Rahmani Nejad, Civil Aviation Organization IranElectronic system that is able to interrupt functionality of electronicclock and command  circuit of clock activated bombs for unlimited timeand deactivates any probable sensors like motion sensor, infra redsensor in some nanoseconds that it is possible to move the Bomb toany other place and then to be deactivated. In special case it is analternate probable method to use liquid nitrogen to neutralize thechemicals and detonator in a neutralizing vessel. Electronic system forneutralizing bombs can be installed on a neutralizing container and it isconnected by several wires to specific points of electronic part of bomband This system is able to interrupt the functionality of bomb forunlimited time and gives Enough time to be neutralized by experts evenin any other place i.e. this system is capable to interrupt thefunctionality of probable sensors of bomb like motion sensortemperature sensor, infra red sensor or any kind of sensor that makesdangers to move the bomb or to change any of environmentalconditions.This system consists of some subsystems as following1. A dummy clock2. Some pseudo sensors that never change their state due to a changeof sensed factor such as motion or temperature or any other actuatingfactor.3. A variable power supply that can be set to have the exact electricalcharacteristics 0f batteries used in bomb.This system is capable of substituting of any of dummy devices thatnever act in proper time. This substitution occurs just in somenanosecond by a very innovative method that no interruption offunctionality for bomb occurs. One nanosecond i.e. 11000000000 ofsecond is to short for bombs of any kind control systems to sense thisinterruption and to be activated.This device is capable for deactivation of1. Deactivation of any bomb with mechanical clock and simplemechanical control system.2. Deactivation of any bomb with electronic clock and complicatedelectronic control system.3. Deactivation any kind of electrical or electronic sensors.4. Deactivation of any kind of mechanical or chemical sensors thatactivation occurs when connection or disconnection occurs fromelectronic point of view any short circuit or open circuit happens.5. Deactivation of any electrical or electronic relay that may act as a partof ignition system or as a part of a sensor circuit.Alternate special case method with this solution when the temperaturereaches to40 to 60 C the battery and any electronic device likecharging capacitors will be deactivated and in less than minus 140Celsius or about 130 degree of Kelvin, detonator and chemicalexplosives will be neutralized.653817, Session 5A novel shoe scanner using an openaccess quadrupoleresonance sensorC. W. Crowley, GE InfrastructureAirport security and efficiency are both compromised by the process ofrequiring passengers to remove their shoe. A novel shoe scannerdeveloped at the GE Security San Diego Center of Excellence usesQuadrupole Resonance QR to identify explosives hidden in shoes. Theshoe scanner was developed with an openaccess chassis andscanning chamber that allows passengers to stand in the system in anatural position during the scanning process. More traditional magneticresonance systems are closed or partially closed and cannot be usedfor screening personnel because the scanning chambers confine theobject in question. The shoe scanners novelty lies in a particularchassis geometry that works in conjunction with an electricallyconnected QR coil geometry. The resulting scanning system achievesthe same level of performance as a more confining system.  The shoescanner is small enough to allow integration with other sensors such asthe GE Itemizer FXTM trace detection system. In fact, the firstapplication of the novel shoe scanner is expected to be as acomponent in a multisensor verification and security system known asthe Secure Registered Traveler SRT Kiosk. The SRT kiosk is designedto be used as part of the TSAs Registered Traveler Program.653818, Session 5Deactivation of nuclear missiles by electromagneticbombhead missilesA. Rahmani Nejad, Civil Aviation Organization IranThis method is based on very efficient idea of using missiles carryingelectromagnetic bomb head. These kind of missiles can explode whenthey are several kilometers far from the nuclear missiles in space oreven they are several kilometers behind ballistic Nuclear missiles. Theadvantages of this method are1. destruction of nuclear missiles is accomplished without direct hit oftwo missiles then it is not very important to guide electromagneticmissiles to the nuclear missile hence accuracy will have minor effectConf. 6538 Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications,and Intelligence C3I Technologies for Homeland Securityand Homeland Defense VI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 72. because in this method, nuclear missiles can be deactivated fromeven several tens of kilometers, then a time delay of some seconds willhave minor effect3. by this method nuclear missiles will not explode in space then thereis no long range nuclear pollution.4. launching a number of electromagnetic head missiles toward thepath of nuclear missiles will make a very reliable fire wall5. because of very small head, such missiles will have very goodmaneuvering parameters.6. such missiles will not have any pollution after acting7. electromagnetic missiles will not have any secondary explosion thatmay make probable secondary explosion8. electromagnetichead missiles can be launched by patrol aircraft forvery fast reaction.9. by using this method nuclear missiles miss the correct path andignition system, control system, and guidance systems will not beoperational and no explosion in space will happen10. this method will have minimum risk and minimum draw backs likepollution in space, explosion in space, accuracy, response time delay.11. this method can be used for deactivating any kind of long rangemissiles or12. this method is very capable when a group of nuclear missiles, anykind of missiles or a group of army aircrafts are near to one another andtend to make possible attack, then by using only one or a few ofelectromagnetic missiles all will be deactivated.653819, Session 5Magnetic gradiometer for detection and localization ofIEDsY. Dalichaouch, B. W. Whitecotton, S. Kuhn, Quantum Magnetics,Inc. D. O. Walsh, Vista Clara, Inc.Improvised explosive devices IEDs are typically made of artillery shells,which contain a significant amount of ferrous metal. As a result, theycan be detected magnetically from a distance. The standoff rangedepends on the size and number of shells. In cluttered environments,these devices can be easily hidden in the natural environment in anumber of ways typically along the roadside. To address this issue, GESecurity is developing a passive magnetic gradiometer for standoffdetection and localization of roadside IEDs.

Sepaniak,P. Dutta, P. J. Chapman, The Univ. of TennesseeOver the past three decades there have been spectaculardevelopments in microelectromechanical MEMS systems.  As aresult, an innovative family of chemical and biological sensors hasemerged.  While MEMS represents a diverse family of designs, deviceswith simple cantilever configurations are especially attractive astransducers for chemical and biological sensors.  A microcantilevertransducer converts changes in the Gibbs surface free energy intomeasurable mechanical responses.  Specific binding sites present inchemically selective layers deposited on a cantilever provide affinity oftargeted analytes to the sensor active area.  Highly selective receptorlayers can be designed using concepts of molecular and biomolecularrecognition.  In this work we discuss chemical sensors based onchemically modified cantilever arrays.  We performed analyte speciesand concentration identification using an array of ten differentiallyfunctionalized microcantilevers coupled with a backpropagationartificial neural network ANN pattern recognition algorithm.  Themicrocantilever array consisted of ten nanostructured siliconmicrocantilevers functionalized with polymeric, gas chromatographyphases and macrocyclic receptors.  The array response to analytevapor was measured by an optical readout scheme and the responseswere recorded for a selection of individual analytes as well as severalbinary mixtures.  An ANN was designed and trained to recognize notonly the individual analytes and binary mixtures, but also to determinethe concentration of individual components in a mixture.  The trainedANN correctly identified the test analytes we used most withprobabilities greater than 97.  The demonstrated unique aspects ofthe present work include the ability to detect chemicals in binarymixtures and provide both qualitative and quantitative information aboutthe chemical environment.Conf. 6538 Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications,and Intelligence C3I Technologies for Homeland Securityand Homeland Defense VI8 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss653825, Session 7A lowcost remote chemical sensor for EUAV platformsR. T. Zehr, S. K. Holland, G. Laufer, Univ. of VirginiaA lowcost sensor for the detection of hazardous chemicals wasdeveloped for deployment on expendable unmanned aerial vehicles EUAVs.  The Totally Optical Vapor Analyzer TOVAtm sensor wasdesigned for seamless and autonomous integration with a small EUAVand was designed to detect chemical vapors in a nadirviewingconfiguration from an altitude of 1000 ft while traveling at an air speedof 60 knots.  The sensor is comprised of eight uncooled pyroelectricinfrared detectors, each integrated with a different infrared bandpassfilter, which provide lowresolution spectral scans of the atmosphereand ground features.  Hazardous chemicals are detected and identifiedby their unique infrared absorption or emission signatures.  Asignificant challenge to passive chemical detection in the 812 micronregime is scene variation resulting from the spectral emissivitycharacteristics of changing terrain features.  Without additionalinformation, such scene changes may be interpreted as a chemicaldetection.  To reduce false alarms resulting from such scene variations,three color filtered red, green, blue photodiode detectors wereintegrated with the TOVAtm sensor.  The photodiode detectors viewthe same scene as the infrared detectors and provide the additionalscene information required to discriminate terrain variations fromchemical detection events.  A unique processing algorithm utilizes datafrom the infrared and visible detectors to identify background or scenechanges, to detect and identify chemicals, and provide alarm levelsbased on the identified chemical and measured optical depth.  Thehybrid sensor has flown in testflights on a Navy EUAV and hasdemonstrated detection and identification of chemicals in laboratoryand outdoor conditions.653826, Session 7Bioaerosol optical sensor model development and initialvalidationS. D. Campbell, MIT Lincoln Lab.This paper describes the development and initial validation of abioaerosol optical sensor model.  The simulation model was used tohelp determine design parameters and estimate performance of a newlowcost optical sensor currently under development at MIT LincolnLaboratory for detecting bioterrorism agents. In order to estimatesensor performance in detecting biowarfare simulants and rejectingenvironmental interferents, use was made of a previously reportedcatalog of EEM excitationemission matrix fluorescence crosssectionmeasurements  1 and previously reported multiwavelengthexcitationbiosensor modeling work2.  In the present study, the biosensormodeled employs a single highpower 365 nm UV LED source plus a IRlaser diode for particle size determination.  The sensor has four outputchannels IR size channel, UV elastic channel and two fluorescencechannels.  The sensor simulation was used to select the fluorescencechannel wavelengths of 400450 and 450600 nm. Using these selectedfluorescence channels, the performance of the sensor in detectingsimulants and rejecting interferents was estimated. Preliminarymeasurements with the sensor for biowarfare simulants andenvironmental interferents are presented.  These results comparefavorably with the simulation results.References1.

Smith, ENSCO,Inc.This paper presents a new paradigm for the utilization of existing videosurveillance cameras as optical sensors to augment and significantlyimprove the reliability and responsiveness of a typical chemical sensorsystem.Under this paradigm cameras serve as optical sensors to monitor theenvironment for indications of the covert release of chemical agents.These agents are highly toxic and cause behavior termed in this paperas duress. Duress symptoms range from simple a prone position tocomplex hacking, jerkiness, or mass panic behaviors. Incorporatingthe detection of these duress behavior signatures elevates chemicalsensing systems to a new and more robust level.Optical sensors effectively fill operational gaps present with chemicalsensor offerings by providing a broad detection range and rapid alarmresponse.  Toxic chemical agents fall into both warfare and industrialcategories and no single sensor today covers the full range. Butregardless of which type of agent is released the result is harmful andyields duress behavior.  Also the time for a typical sensor to test an airsample may be on the order of minutes.  Given the rapid onset ofduress symptoms an optical sensor can detect the effectsimmediately.  In either case the optical sensor can provide a cue to amonitoring system to focus air sampling or correlate results fromstandard chemical sensors.Adoption of this new paradigm provides a means to enhance andaugment the use of existing chemical sensors. At the same time itdoubles the effectiveness and utilization, without impact, to videocameras that are a ubiquitous part of security in most modern buildings.653829, Session 8Evaluation of robot deployment in live missions with thepolice, military, and fire brigadeC.

The driving force being to removehumans from risk, to perform more efficiently or at lower cost and toenable missions unsuited to humans. It is, however, not always obviouswhen to deploy new technology. To early and unsuccessful attemptsmight seriously influence the prospects for future investments.Thorough comparison of costs and profits associated with newtechnology is required, benefits have to be valued against costs foracquisition, integration, training, maintenance as well as missionefficiency and reliability.Many aspects of this valuation will require a realistic environment and auser with an established and wellexperienced knowledge of aparticular system. Of these demands the later is prone to pose aparadox.  No experienced users will be available for concepts that arestill under development. Instead inference has to be done from relatedfields or through early user evaluation.This paper reports on a study of three groups the police, the militaryand the fire brigade, with several years of experience from deployingrobots as part of their operations. The research included surveying oflimitations with current technology, desires of future improvements,attitude towards robots within the organization and documentation ofcommon robot missions.

H. An, Prometheus Inc. J. T. Cobb, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.Panama City B. Shenefelt, R. Tolimieri, Prometheus Inc.Automatic detection of sea mines in coastal regions is a difficult taskdue to the highly variable sea bottom conditions present in theunderwater environment. Detection systems must be able todiscriminate objects which vary in size, shape, and orientation fromnaturally occurring and manmade clutter. Additionally, automatedsystems must be computationally efficient to be incorporated intounmanned underwater vehicle UUV sensor systems characterized byhigh sensor data rates and limited processing abilities. Usingnoncommutative group harmonic analysis, a fast, robust sea minedetection system is created. A family of unitary image transformsassociated to noncommutative groups is generated and applied to sidescan sonar image files supplied by Naval Surface Warfare CenterPanama City NSWC PC. These transforms project key image features,geometrically defined structures with orientations, and localizedspectral information into distinct orthogonal components or featuresubspaces of the image.

Once itis completed, the sensor system will be fully integrated with a gesturerecognition system to automatically detect and track the flight decktraffic director, to recognize hisher gestures, and to guide the UCAV forits motion.Because of its small size, low power consumption, and light weight,OmniGuard sensor will have its significance in UAV based applicationssuch as autonomous taking off and landing, intelligent surveillance, andautonomous safe navigation through collision avoidance. It can also beinstalled in any remote locations for remote surveillance. In fact,leveraging similar technology, we are working with Sikorsky AircraftCorp to develop an automatic taking off and landing system for cargolifting and transporting applications.653833, Session 8Improving the power, bandwidth, and latencyperformance of UAVbased imaging systems bystructural computation methodsA. Cernasov, Honeywell Defense and Space Electronic SystemsWhen designing an imaging system to be used aboard smallindependent platforms, tradeoffs must be made among a number ofinterrelated parameters such as image resolution, frame rate,compression ratio, latency, power consumption, link bandwidth,physical size and others. While in many cases a standard designcomprised of multiple functional blocks integrated together and thenadapted to the requirements of the platform, may suffice, furthersignificant improvements can be achieved by a more unitary approach.This presentation details a method of executing complex sumofproducts algorithms by redesigning the geometry of the applicablesensor. For example, by changing the geometry and distribution ofpixels of an image sensor array the complete JPEG compressionsection of an MPEG2 processor becomes redundant and can beeliminated. Such structural computation methods can reduce powerconsumption, latency and space requirements of UAVs, camcorders orcell phones.653834, Session 9Effects of prior knowledge on the effectiveness of ahybrid user model for information retrievalH. Nguyen, Univ. of WisconsinWhitewater E. Santos, Jr., DartmouthCollegeTo quickly find relevant information from huge amount of data is a verychallenging issue for intelligence analysts. Many of them use their priordomain knowledge to improve their process of finding relevantinformation. In this paper, we explore the influences of a users priordomain knowledge on the effectiveness of an information seeking taskby using seed user models. In our approach, a user model is created byusing the multiattribute utility theory to evaluate values of the attributesdescribing a users intent in combination with the attributes describingan information retrieval system. Our test bed consists of threecollections from the information retrieval community CRANFIELD,MEDLINE, and CACM. We divide each query set from a collection intotwo subsets training and testing sets. We use three differentapproaches to choose the queries into a training set the queriesgenerate the largest domain knowledge, the queries relate to mostqueries in a testing set, and mixture of both. Each seed user model iscreated by running our enhanced information retrieval system throughsuch a training set. We assess the effects of having more domainknowledge, or more relevant domain knowledge, or mixture of both onthe effectiveness of a user in an information seeking task.653835, Session 9A disaster recovery system featuring uncertaintyvisualization and distributed infrastructureL.

A. Williams, SimiGon, Ltd.PROJECT BACKGROUND AND GOALSPerimeter defense and facility security applications have historicallybeen alarm management and monitoring functions designed to deter,detect, document and denydelay any intrusion. Contemporary warfareincluding counterterrorism has become hybrid in nature and studiesmust be conducted for the design of new tools to counter these modernthreats. These studies will enable decision makers to choose theappropriate mix of sensor fusion and intelligent agent support in ablended world of real and simulated data. The level to which simulationcan support real world imagery and sensor data in an AIaugmentedenvironment is the subject of this study.METHODOLOGYPROCEDUREThe end goal for the security planner is fielding a system which exhibitsa low false alarm rate FAR with a high probability of detection. Thisproblem set has been successfully managed. This research will focuson augmenting the analysis of threat through sensor fusion and AIaugmented decision support.PROJECT RESULTSA simulation of a simplified urban perimeter configuration has beencompleted. These results identify the feasibility of realworld sensorsoverlaid on simulated worlds. Threat models are being developed toassist in reducing FAR. An AIaugmented monitor provides enhancedsituational awareness and decision support for the operator.SIGNIFICANCEPrevious studies of sensor fusion have shown significant improvementin FAR and intrusion detection. Very few simulations have blended realworld data with replicated architecture and urban components toenhance situational awareness. Modeling large volumetric securityoperations using blended real and simulated components allows asignificant increase in perimeter and internal intrusion detection.FUTURE WORKSimulation of more complex urban or facility areas is needed so thatrefined threat models can be developed while enhancing the AIaugmented monitoring function.653839, Session 9Bayesian inferance and conditional probabilities asperformance metrics for homeland security sensorsT. P. Jannson, Physical Optics Corp.In this paper, military and homeland security sensors, sensor systems,and sensor fusion, are discussed in the context of performance metricsparameters,and in the form of direct and inverse conditionalprobabilities, based on signal theory. In particular, false alarm rate, falsepositive rate, false negative rate, and the probability of detection arediscussed as conditional probabilities within the classical and Bayesianinferences. Several examples from various homeland security areas arealso discussed for concept illustration. As a result, it is shown thatperformance of the vast majority of sensor systems can be discussed interms of these parameters.653840, Session 9Threedimensional visual mechinism by neuralnetworkingsS. Sugiyama, Gifu Univ. JapanThere are some computer vision systems that are available on a marketbut those are quite different from in a sense of a real usage of our dailylife, like the surroundings sensing that needs to recognize the detaildescription of an object, etc. So here studies on mechanisms of how apair of human eyes can recognize a distance apart, an object edging,and an object in order to get the essences of vision mechanisms. Andthose basic mechanisms of object recognition are simplified andextended logically for applying to a computer vision system as shownbelow.Vision must have started with organisms detecting the differencebetween light and dark. Molecular genetics reveals that this began inbroad daylight with cone photoreceptors Bowmaker, 1998, ahypothesis suggested earlier by the comparative anatomist, GordonWalls 1942. Under these conditions shadows must have been the mainstimuli for detecting movements and objects. A shadow depolarizes, i.e.activates, a cone, which releases a neurotransmitter that depolarizessecond order retinal neurons, bipolar cells, called offcenter bipolarsand horizontal cells. The reappearance of light by movementhyperpolarizes the cones. This stops the release of the transmitter,which in turn stops, i.e. hyperpolarizes, the offbipolars and horizontalcells. This also disinhibits a parallel system of bipolars, called onbipolars. Disinhibition occurs because the same transmitter released bythe cone inhibits the on and excites the offbipolars. On and off conebipolars have different receptors for the same transmitter. This pushpullarrangement of on and off bipolars provides the main input to the brainConf. 6538 Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications,and Intelligence C3I Technologies for Homeland Securityand Homeland Defense VI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 11about the visual universe. One channel signals darkness the othersignals lightness., stated by Peter Gouras.From the above knowledge, we can have the following extractions asthe vision mechanisms.1 Light and Dark of an object gives a cone two states, OFFBIPOLARS and ONBIPOLARS.2 OFFBIPORLARS and ONBIPOLARS appear as a transmitter ofsignal in turn when a situation of object is different from the previousDark to Light.3 Both Output signals of OFFBIPOLARS and ONBIPOLARS go tothe adjacent Horizontal Cell.By using these mechanisms, some of the results about recognition areintroduced on this paper.653841, Session 10Unattended ground sensor system architecture forreduced information dissemination timelineP. E. Voglewede, S. Hironori, Harris Corp.In a multilayered command structure, information from unattendedground sensor systems has typically been transferred from theobservation area to the highest level of command. The information isanalyzed from many such regions and disseminated to the appropriateforward operating base as intelligence or action orders. Some missions,like the detection and interdiction of Time Critical Targets, may behampered by the current data dissemination timeline. Thereforealternate, faster methods of providing actionable intelligence intotheater are required for these missions. This paper discusses alternativearchitectures that reduce the information dissemination time line fromthe sensor fields through the command center and back down to thequick reactionary forces.653842, Session 10Intelligent management of distributed sensor networksP.

A network of intelligent modules, overlaying sensornetwork, collectively interprets mission scenarios in high level WorldProcessing Language WPL, which can start from any nodes and coverthe network at runtime, ruling its behavior. The distributed interpreterhas been prototyped and tested on numerous applications, with WPLprograms being extremely short as most of synchronization and dataagent exchange is shifted to automatic implementation, allowing usconcentrate on global solutions instead. The WPL code will beexhibited and discussed for distributed collection, fusion,generalization, and routing of sensor data simultaneous tracking andstudying of multiple mobile targets in the area covered by sensors aswell as more complex tasks, unattainable by other distributedtechnologies, like analyzing various distributed dynamic phenomenaflocks, manned or unmanned groupsarmies, spreading fireflooding,etc. with their spatial tracking by societies of communicating sensors,and regular reporting the generalized data like shapes andor centers ofweight to an external user.

Deng, H. Xu, Intelligent Automation Inc.Threatening sound detection, classification and localization is anexample technology that can be effectively used in asymmetric warfareand against terrorist threats. Recently, significant research efforts havebeen made in this area using wireless sensor networks WSNs.However, there are two critical issues related to signal processing inWSNs.  First, energyefficiency, memoryconsumption, bandwidthutilization, and computationcomplexity are of main concern. Second,the application environments e.g. battlefield, urban area containvarious types of nonstationary and nonGaussian noise, multipathechoes, and simultaneous emission sources. These severeenvironmental effects make acoustic pattern recognition difficult.Therefore, new techniques are sought for reliable and timely acousticthreat detection, identification and accurate source localization atreasonable energymemorybandwidthcomputation cost in thepresence of significant background noise and multipath effects.In this paper, we present a novel acoustic threat recognition systemwith a distributed and hierarchical architecture. The functions of threatdetection, classification and source localization are organized inmultiple levels, namely, base level, gateway node level and sensingnode level. At each level, the information processing task is performedin a distributed manner. On the other hand, the proposed systemarchitecture allows cooperation among sensing nodes to collaborativelydetect target signatures, reduce false alarms, classify target types, andestimate the acoustic source location. The system combines recentadvances in Wavelet Analysis, intelligent learning and sensor fusion. Inparticular, the proposed Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform DWPTbased powerlaw detection algorithm is robust to environmental noise,yet computationally efficient. An individual false alarm reduction modelis designed to reduce the possible false detections using the knowledgeobtained from training samples. The Bayesian and DempsterShaferdecision fusion techniques are applied to further improve the threatclassification accuracy. The performance of the proposed system hasbeen evaluated using both available datasets and extensiveexperiments. Its advantages include energy efficiency, reliable detectionand classification, low detection and classification latency, reducedfalse alarms, and efficient bandwidth utilization.653845, Session 10Seismic refraction tomography for detecting shallowburied pipesC.

Active acousticseismic interrogation of the firstmeter of the soil is also a proven technology for UXO and landminedetection.  Seismic techniques are based upon the propagation of smallamplitude mechanical waves. Seismic methods detect anomalouszones in mechanical properties bulk and shear stiffnesscomplianceand densities within the subsurface because these properties controlthe velocity, attenuation, and impedance of the seismic waves. For theproblem of pipe detection, the mechanical and density anomaliesassociated with the presence of a pipe are immense. The densitycontrast of an airfilled void within the ground is likely larger than anyother natural physical situation that exists in the subsurface. Althoughthe elastic compliance and density contrasts between a pipe and thesurrounding material are high, seismic techniques have not beenextensively used. Two reasons are 1 the pipe diameter is relativelysmall compared to the spatial sampling and averaging from typicalseismic surveys and 2 the surrounding soil is highly heterogeneouswith respect to its mechanical properties. This presentation will discussthe use of seismic refraction tomography for locating buried pipes. Datafrom several field sites containing pipes at different depths will bepresented.653846, Session 10Acoustic leakdetection system for railroadtransportation securityP. C. Womble, A. P. Barzilov, D.

Spadaro,Institute for Scientific Research, Inc.Pressurized rail tank cars transport large volumes of volatile liquids andgases throughout the country, much of which is hazardous andorflammable. These gases, once released in the atmosphere, can wreakhavoc with the environment and local populations. We developed asystem which can nonintrusively and noninvasively detect and locatepinholesized leaks in pressurized rail tank cars using acoustic sensors.The sound waves from a leak are produced by turbulence from the gasleaking to the atmosphere. For example, a 500 mm hole in an air tankpressurized to 689 kPa produces a broad audio frequency spectrumwith a peak near 40 kHz. This signal is detectable at 10 meters with asound pressure level of 25 dB. We are able to locate a leak source usingtriangulation techniques.  The prototype of the system consists of anetwork of acoustic sensors and is located approximately 10 metersfrom the center of the railline. The prototype has two types of acousticsensors, each with different narrow frequency response band 40 kHzand 80 kHz.  The prototype is connected to the Internet using WiFi802.11g transceiver and can be remotely operated from anywhere inthe world.

Chao, The Hong Kong Polytechnic Univ. Hong Kong ChinaPiezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer pMUT consists of apiezoelectric capacitor built on a micromachined silicon membrane, andusually exploits its flexural vibration mode for ultrasound transmittingand sensing. It typically operates at the fundamental frequency, wheremaximum sensitivity can be achieved, and is insensitive at higher orderof resonances because the harmonic signals generated from differentparts of the diaphragm tend to cancel with each other. This leads to avery narrow bandwidth. In this paper, rectangularshaped pMUTs fordualfrequency reception are proposed and fabricated by usingpiezoelectric PVDFTrFE copolymer coating and siliconmicromachining technologies. The electrode patterns are properlydesigned to efficiently make use of both 0, 0 and 0, 2 vibration modesof the rectangular membrane. By adjusting the length and width of thediaphragm, the ratio of the two frequencies can be varied on demandwithin a wide range. The micromachined dualfrequency sensors will beuseful for miniaturized ultrasonic systems operating on binary frequencyshiftkeyed BFSK principles, such as precise distance detectors andultrasonic localarea communication terminals.653848, Session 10ATDRbased tomographic optical sonar ATOSR.

In this strategy, the trust was defined bystatistical hypothesis in probability theory and the cluster head wasselected by node trust and node mobility. A series of simulationexperiments were made for this strategy and the results showed thatthis strategy can realize the function of the malicious nodes detectionwhich was neglected by other clustering algorithms and overcome thedeficiency of being incapable of implementing the relative mobilitymetric of corresponding nodes in other MOBIC algorithms.

South KoreaFor better moving performance of robots, the measure of force datafrom the ground is inevitable.  The traditional and basic tool for forcemeasurement is to use a forcetorque sensor. A 6axis forcetorquesensor can measure all directions force data, 3 forces and 3 torquesapplied to the body. This paper describes mechanically coupled designof a 6axis forcetorque sensor using strain gauges especially. Inmechanically coupled sensors, force data can not be obtained directlyfrom strain signals. Instead output data should be calculated through aadditional matrix calculation. Here we suggested a new design methodof a small size 6axis forcetorque sensor module. In this paper, weproposed design guide of the sensors structure design, amplitudecircuit, and details for the data acquisition board.653851, Session 11Early attack reaction sensor EARS a manwearablegunshotL.

Aguilar, R. A. Salinas, Univ. de Santiago de Chile Chile M. A.Abidi, The Univ. of TennesseeThe phenomenon of ballistic shock wave emission by a small calibreprojectile at supersonic speed is quite relevant in automatic sniperlocalization applications. When available, ballistic shock wave analysismakes possible the estimation of the main ballistic features of a gun fireevent. The propagation of ballistic shock waves in air is a process whichmainly involves nonlinear distortion, or steepening, and atmosphericabsorption. Current ballistic shock wave propagation models used inautomatic sniper localization systems only consider nonlinear distortioneffects. This means that only the rates of change of shock peakpressure and the Nwave length with distance are considered in thedetermination of the miss distance. In the present paper we present animproved acoustical model of small calibre ballistic shock wavepropagation in air, intended to be used in acousticsbased automaticsniper localization applications. In our approach, we have considerednonlinear distortion, but additionally we have also introduced the effectsof atmospheric sound absorption. Atmospheric absorption isimplemented in the time domain in order to get faster calculation timesthan those computed in the frequency domain. Furthermore, we takeadvantage of the fact that atmospheric absorption plays a fundamentalrole in the rise times of the shocks, and introduce the rate of change ofthe rise time with distance as a third parameter to be used in thedetermination of the miss distance. This leads us to a more accurateand robust estimation of the miss distance, and consequently of theprojectile trajectory, and the spatial coordinates of the gunshot origin.653853, Session 11Time difference of arrival blast localization using anetwork of disposable sensorsR. A. Knobler, T. J. Plummer, McQ, Inc.Determining the location of an explosive event using a networkedsensor system within an acceptable accuracy is a challenging problem.McQ has developed such a system, using a mesh network ofinexpensive acoustic sensors.  The system performs a threedimensional, timedifferenceofarrival TDOA localization of blasts ofvarious yields in several different environments.  Localizationinformation of the blast is provided to the end user by exfiltration oversatellite communications.  The system is able to perform accurately inthe presence of various sources of error including GPS position,propagation effects, temperature, and error in determining the time ofarrival TOA.  The system design as well as its performance will bepresented.653854, Session 11Searchmatching algorithm for acousticsbasedautomatic sniper localizationJ. R. Aguilar, R. A. Salinas, Univ. de Santiago de Chile Chile M. A.Abidi, The Univ. of TennesseeMost modern automatic sniper localization systems are based on theutilization of the acoustical emissions produced by the gun fire events.In order to estimate the spatial coordinates of the sniper location, thesesystems measure the time delay of arrival of the acoustical shock wavefronts to a microphone array. Furthermore, model based estimation ofthe nonlinear distortion parameters of the Nwaves is used to makeprojectile trajectory and calibre estimations. In this work, we addressthe sniper localization problem using a model based searchmatchingapproach. The automatic sniper localization algorithm works searchingfor the acoustics model of ballistic shock waves which best matchesthe measured data. For this purpose, we implement a previouslyreleased acoustics model of ballistic shock waves. Moreover, the sniperlocation, the projectile trajectory and calibre, as well as the muzzlevelocity are regarded as the input variables of such a model. A searchalgorithm is implemented in order to find what combination of the inputvariables minimizes a fitness function defined as the Euclidean distancebetween measured and simulated data. In order to evaluate theperformance of the algorithm, we conduct computerbasedexperiments using simulated gunfire event data calculated at the nodesof a virtual distributed sensor network. Preliminary simulation results arequite promising, showing fast convergence of the algorithm and goodlocalization accuracy.653855, Session 11A strong tracking extended Kalman observer EKO forprojectile attitude and position estimationM. Boutayeb, Univ. Louis Pasteur France S. Changey, InstitutFrancoAllemand de Recherches de SaintLouis France J. Bara,Univ. Louis Pasteur FranceDuring the last four decades, state estimation for non linear dynamicalsystems has the subject of tremendous research activities. A large wideof applications concerns, in particular, the military domain. In this notewe focus on projectile attitude and position estimation usingmagnetometer sensor only. Attitude is usually estimated by completesystem with several sensors. According to important biases on rotationssensors, it is essential to use a fix reference such as earth magneticfield. This paper investigates the comparison of the direction of theearth measured on the projectile with the computation of the projectionby the estimation of the attitude. According to non linearity of theevolution and the observation model, only a Kalman type observernamely EKO or EKF in a stochastic context can be used. However, it isworth to notice that the main drawback of this standard technique is theextreme sensitivity to initialisations or divergence when the system ispoorly observable.In this contribution we analyse convergence behaviour of a simple anduseful design procedure used as a state estimator of the projectileattitude and position. Based on our recent works, we show here theconnection between some instrumental matrices and the basin ofattraction. Furthermore, from the established sufficient conditions forasymptotic convergence we provide a simple way to design sucharbitrary matrices in the goal to ensure strong tracking in spite of verybad initialisations and perturbations. High performances of theproposed approach will be shown through simulation results underworst conditions.653856, Session 12Deployment of laser illuminated CCD cameras as part ofan integrated perimeter management systemD. J. Natelson, Vumii Inc.Perimeter security typically involves layers of detection andinvestigation. Much has been invested in detection, yet for decades theaccepted approach for nightvision investigation beyond 100 metershas been thermalbased sensor systems. Thermal systems are valuabletools however, they are challenged by low resolution 320x240,640x480 vs. todays highres cameras, operator complications,ongoing maintenance costs, and limited video controls.

S. Garcia, Old Dominion Univ. M. N. Abedin, NASA LangleyResearch Ctr. S. K. Sharma, A. K. Misra, Univ. of Hawaii at ManoaS. Ismail, S. P. Sandford, NASA Langley Research Ctr. H. E.ElsayedAli, Old Dominion Univ.Recent and future explorations of Mars and lunar surfaces using roversand landers have spawned great interest in developing an instrumentthat can perform insitu analysis of minerals on planetary surfaces. Ofseveral possible techniques for such analysis, Raman spectroscopy isthe best suited because it can unambiguously provide the compositionand structure of a material. A remote pulsed laser Raman spectroscopysystem for analyzing minerals was demonstrated at NASA LangleyResearch Center in collaboration with the University of Hawaii. Thissystem utilizes a 532 nm pulsed laser as an excitation wavelength, anda telescope with a 4inch aperture for collecting backscatteredradiation. A spectrograph equipped with a super notch filter forattenuating Rayleigh scattering is used to analyze the scattered signal.To form the Raman spectrum, the spectrograph utilizes a holographictransmission grating that simultaneously disperses two spectral trackson the detector for increased spectral range. The spectrum is recordedon an intensified chargecoupled device ICCD camera system, whichprovides high gain to allow detection of inherently weak Stokes lines. Toevaluate the performance of the system, Raman standards such ascalcite and naphthalene are analyzed. Several sets of rock andgemstone samples are tested using the Raman spectroscopy system.The results obtained from these analyses are presented.653858, Session 12Automatic linear feature extraction from lidar andimageryC. Poullis, S. You, U. Neumann, Univ. of Southern CaliforniaAutomatic extraction and modeling of linear features, such astransportation and waterways networks, is important for manyapplications in civilian, intelligence community, military operations.While this problem has been addressed over the years, the gapbetween the stateoftheart and goal is still wide. This paper presents anovel technique for automatically detecting and modeling linear featuresfrom LIDAR and aerial imagery. Uniquely, the proposed approach is anintegrated solution that merges the power of perceptual grouping theoryTensor Voting, Gabor filtering and classification with imagecues undera unified framework to address the problems of linear feature detectionand classification. Gabor filtering is employed to extract orientation andfrequency information, resulting in a multichannel map that containsonly features of special interest. A new data representation, calledtensorialrepresentation, is used to represent the data. Such a tensorialrepresentation is very efficient when dealing with noisy, incomplete andcomplicated scenes. Its able to not only describe unambiguouslyvarying geometry elements point, curve, surface under a unifiedframework, but also encode considerably richer information ofstructures. The feature inference is based on a voting communicationprocess that is governed by a perceptualfield, encoding the constraintsand rules of how a point receivescasts votes fromto its neighbors. Theaccumulation of votes at each point provides an accurate estimate ofthe features going through the point. By combining the voting results forall channels, the extracted features are modeled and classified, andfinally converted to vector maps.653860, Session 13Configuration of electrooptic fire source detectionsystemR.

H. Chow, D. E. McClelland, M. B. Gray, The Australian NationalUniv. AustraliaOne of the main factors limiting high performance remote fiber sensingsystems is the Rayleigh backscatter associated with a long length ofoptical delivery fiber.  Rayleigh backscatter introduces amplitude andphase noise during interferometric signal extraction, resulting indegradation of system sensitivity.  This noise source increases with thelength of optical fiber used in the architecture, and thus traditionallysets the lower limit on signal strength and the total remote sensingdistance.We present the latest results for a 100 km remote fiber dynamic strainsensing system, where a radiofrequency RF modulated laser is usedto interrogate a fiber FabryPerot sensor.  The signal extraction isderived interferometrically from the differential phase between thecarrier and its RF sidebands.  We demonstrate unprecedented remotesensitivity performance by complete mitigation of the debilitating effectsassociated with Rayleigh backscatter in the 100 km of optical deliveryfiber.  We show that optimization of the laser modulation depth, as wellas fiber FabryPerot design both facilitate a large signaltonoise ratio.This maximized signaltonoise ratio enables the complete suppressionof the noise associated with Rayleigh backscatter.  The result is a longdistance remote fiber sensing system that is limited only by the laserfrequency noise.  This remote sensitivity is an important breakthroughfor a range of applications, such as sea floor acoustic sensing arrays,deep sea hydrophone arrays, and remote surveillance arrays.653864, Session 13Hot embossing of LCP using silicon master tool forshortdistance optical interconnectsK. Yadav, S. R. Kirkpatrick, A. Siahmakoun, RoseHulman Instituteof TechnologyA novel method has been developed for manufacturing of chiptochipoptical interconnects for highspeed data transmission in hybrid printedcircuit board PCB. The method includes wet etch of a 100 siliconwafer using previously discovered anisotropic etching techniques for 45   and vertical walls. Anisotropically etched surfaces produce a mastertool for hotembossing of the liquid crystal polymer LCP substrate.The LCP channels are filled with corecladding polymers or coated witha reflecting thin film to form optical waveguides for circuit board levelshort distance optical interconnects. Various waveguide devices suchas STAR, Ysplitters, and straight line channels of different lengths arestructured onto the silicon substrate. A detailed process flow has beendeveloped which realizes 45o surfaces at the entry and exit positions ofthe waveguide devices for vertical light coupling. The vertical wallsalong the length of the waveguide devices are etched to minimize thepropagation losses. The angle of the splitters is limited by chemicaletching hence all the straight channels, 2 and 4 cm long, except thesplitters are observed to transmit the light in freespace from one end tothe other. These hotembossed channels in LCP are sputtered withaluminum after the embossing.  The freespace light transmission hasalso been observed in an 8cm long, 200 m wide, and 60 m deepchannel of the embossed LCP substrate. We will present the completeprocess flow explaining the fundamental technique including the hotembossing process with silicon master tool to imprint the waveguidestructures onto LCP substrate.653865, Session 14Realtime air quality monitoring by using internet videosurveillance cameraH. S. Lim, M. Z. Mat Jafri, K. Abdullah, Univ. Sains MalaysiaMalaysiaNowadays internet video surveillance cameras are widely use insecurity monitoring. The quantities of installations of these camerasalso become more and more. This paper reports that the internet videosurveillance cameras can be applied as a remote sensor for monitoringthe concentrations of particulate matter less than 10 micron PM10, sothat real time air quality can be monitored at multi locationsimultaneously. An algorithm was developed based on the regressionanalysis of relationship between the measured reflectance and thereflected components from a surface material and the atmosphere. Thisalgorithm converts multispectral image pixel values acquired from thesecameras into quantitative values of the concentrations of PM10. Thesecomputed PM10 values were compared to other standard valuesmeasured by a DustTrakTM meter. The correlation results showed thatthe newly develop algorithm produced a high degree of accuracy asindicated by high correlation coefficient R2 and low rootmeansquareerror RMS. The preliminary results showed that the accuracy producedby this internet video surveillance camera is better than an internetprotocol IP camera. Basically the quality of images acquired by the IPcamera was poorer compared to the internet video surveillance camera.This is because the images acquired by IP camera had beencompressed and there is no compression for the images from theinternet video surveillance camera.653866, Session 14Animal eyes in homeland security systemsA.

Such risks can be mitigated, to an extent, viaoperational awareness and effective communications. However, recentconflicts have involved a much more dynamic, complex and technicallysophisticated battlefield than previously experienced, for example,Operation Telic Desert Storm with almost one million combatants andten thousand armoured vehicles in the coalition force advancing acrossan extensive battlefront at high speed during daylight and at nightmaking effective use of a range of electrooptic sensors. Theaccelerated tempo of battle means that front lines can undergo rapid,punctuated, advance that can leave individual combat units with amuch degraded situational awareness, particularly of where they are inrelation to other friendly combatants. Consequently there is a need fora robust, low cost, low weight, compact, unpowered, interoperable,Combat Identification technique for use with popular electroopticsensors which can be deployed, and is effective, at the individualcombat unit level. In this paper we discuss groundtoground combatidentification materials that meet these requirements based on the airtoground Miragetm vehicle marking material.

RDXmolecules adopts C3v symmetry in the vapor, solution, and solidphases, in contrast to stable RDX solid phase which has close to Cssymmetry. Infrared and Raman spectra in solid state and solution ofRDX and of 13C, 15N on ring and fully 15N enriched RDX analogueshave been recorded and their fundamental frequencies have beenassigned using isotopic frequency shifts. Chemical calculationsapplying ab initio Density Functional Theory DFT have been carried outfor the three RDX isotopomers at the 6311G basis set level and thecomputed vibrational frequencies have been compared with theexperimental ones. The calculated isotopic frequency shifts, induced by13C and 15N labeling are in very good accordance with measuredones. The changes in vibrational modes associate with the isotopicsubstitutions are well modeled by the calculation and previousassignments of the vibrational spectra are revised especially where theexact nature of the vibrational modes had been either vague orcontradictory.653880, Session 16Surface enhanced Raman scattering of TNT on colloidalnanoparticles of AgTiO2E. De La CruzMontoya, S. P. HernndezRivera, T. LunaPineda, G.PrezAcosta, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezSilver nanoparticles coated with titanium dioxide were synthesized via asimple route, where the reduction of Ag to Ag0 and the controlledpolymerization of TiO2 on the surface of silver crystallites take placesimultaneously. The nanoparticles prepared were characterized by UVVIS absorption and by Energy Dispersive Xray spectroscopy EDAX.The spectrum of the suspension of Ag nanoparticles had a maximumabsorption at 420 nm arising from the surface plasmon of the particles,in which is characteristic of Ag colloidal dispersion. Similar surfaceplasmon absorption due to Ag nanoparticles was observed for thesuspension of Titaniacoated Ag nanoparticles at longer wavelengthredshifted than for the suspension of Ag nanoparticles. Thisabsorption shift is caused by refractive index changes due to Titaniaand suggests coverage of Ag nanoparticles with Titania. AgTiO2colloids were used to measure Raman spectra by capillary tube methodat different excitation sources to observe the enhancement of theRaman signatures of solutions of TNT at different pH. At pH  10.3showed an increase of the NO2 stretching mode at the 1365 cm1 incomparison with the other pH values and the solution without colloids.In addition, the bands ca. 1213 cm1 and   NO2 1360 cm1 areslightly shifted to higher wavenumbers, indicating a strong adsorbatesurface interaction.653881, Session 16Characterization of thermal conductivity of liquidsthrough a metallic skinM. L. Ramirez, S. P. HernndezRivera, O. Ruiz, L. PachecoLondoo, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezAccording to recent reports the bombing attempt to a LondonUSairline and world safety involved the use of liquids to create anexplosive mixture. This improvised explosive device IED is undetectedby current airport safety technologies and could be activated duringConf. 6538 Sensors, and Command, Control, Communications,and Intelligence C3I Technologies for Homeland Securityand Homeland Defense VIflight. This revealed a new modality and vulnerability of transportationsecurity systems the use of liquid explosives based devices. Mostmethods to detect explosive liquids are based of spectroscopicmethods and they are not effective characterizing liquids in a thick glassbottle andor liquids concealed in cans. An alternative for detection inthis scenario can be thermal conductivity.  Thermal conductivity isbased in an interfacial heat reflectance device which contacts aconstant current heat source to the powder sample. The temperature ofthe interface is monitored and the rate of temperature rise is thenrelated to the thermal conductivity of the unknown sample. Higherthermal conductivity samples produce a lower rate of temperature risebecause the heat is being conducted away from the interface.Measurements of thermal conductivity through a common aluminumsoda can make it possible to discriminate materials that have differentthermal conductivity behavior.  This technique has the potential use asan airport safety detector for hazardous liquids that have differentthermal conductivity properties from soda formulations. The technologycan be employed to find hidden liquids in soda cans.653882, Session 16Characterization and differentiation of highenergy amineperoxides by direct analysis in realtimeTOFA. J.

G. Hassebrook, D. L. Lau, V. Yalla, A. Fatehpuria, Q. Lao, Univ. ofKentuckyA new area of fingerprint technology, known as 3D fingerprinting usesnoncontact methods to map 2Dimensional texture images onto a 3Dimensional surface in the shape of a finger. Performing this nail tonail mapping gives what is analogous to fingerprint DNA to lawenforcement. Our group has taken this a step further in that we do notmap 2D texture images, but instead, directly measure and capture theridge heights. The texture information is simultaneously captured duringthis process. We do this using a well known approach of StructuredLight Illumination. We have implemented two prototype systems, onefor finger print and one for palm print. Our long term goal is to scan theentire hand but for this paper we will evaluate the performance of thefinger and palm prints separately.  We will focus on answering twoquestions 1 How should the 3D data be prepared for optimummapping into existing 2Dimensional rolled fingerprint data basesAnd 2 how can the ridge depth information be optimally used torecover a representation of a latent finger or palm print Subtopicswithin these questions are the affects of lateral and depth resolution,measurement accuracy, affects of hand movement during scanningperiod and affects of interlacing multiple scan patches to achieve wraparound or rolled equivalent data. We will study these issues in terms ofNISTFBI standards as well as standard signal processing performancemeasures.653903, Session 1Robust fingerprint acquisitionR. K. Rowe, K. A. Nixon, S. Parthasaradhi, U. Uludag, Lumidigm,Inc.A comparative study on multiple participants was undertaken toquantify the ability of a multispectral imaging MSI fingerprint sensor  toperform reliable biometric matching in the presence of samplinginfluences that included finger wetness, dirt, chalk, acetone, brightambient light, high pressure and low pressure sampling conditions. Thestudy was conducted in conjunction with three commercially availabletotal internal reflectance TIR sensors run in parallel under identicalsampling conditions. Representative images as well as receiveroperating characteristic ROC curves demonstrate the ability of the MSIsensor to collect usable images under conditions in which theperformance of the other optical sensors degrade or even cease tooperate.  In addition, results are presented that demonstrate theinteroperability of MSI images with images collected by these otheroptical sensors.653927, Session 1Threedimensional surface reconstruction andrecognitionD. J. Bardsley, B. Li, The Univ. of Nottingham United KingdomIn this paper we propose a novel 3D face recognition system.Furthermore we propose and discuss the development of a 3Dreconstruction system designed specifically for the purpose of facerecognition. The reconstruction subsystem utilises a capture rigcomprising of six cameras to obtain two independent stereo pairs of thesubject face during a structured light projection with the remaining twocameras obtaining texture data under normal lighting conditions. Whilstthe most common approaches to 3D reconstruction use least squarecomparison of image intensity values, our system achieves dense pointmatching using Gabor Wavelets as the primary correspondencemeasure. The matching process is aided by Voronoi segmentation ofthe input images using strong confidence correlations as Voronoi seeds.Additional matches are then propagated outwards from the initial seedmatches to produce a dense point cloud and surface model. Within therecognition subsystem models are first registered to a generic headmodel, and then a novel similarity metric based on modified ICPIterative Closest Point is applied between the recognition subject andeach model in the comparison database, using alignment error as therecognition metric. Our system takes full advantage of the additionalinformation obtained from the shape and structure of the face, thuscombating some of the inherent weaknesses of traditional 2D methodssuch as pose and illumination variations. This novel reconstruction recognition process shows competitive recognition rates on databasesof 150 subjects.653904, Session 2Quality dependent fusion of intramodal and multimodalbiometric expertsJ. Kittler, Univ. of Surrey United KingdomNo abstract available653905, Session 3Classification of handwritten signatures based on namelegibilityJ. GalballyHerrero, J. FierrezAguilar, J. OrtegaGarcia, Univ.Autnoma de Madrid SpainThanks to its common use in many different applications, handwrittensignature is one of the most widely accepted authentication methods. Itcovers to some extent all of the main characteristics of a biometric traiti.e., universality, distinctiveness, permanence and collectability so it isfeasible to develop automatic recognition systems based on it.Automatic signature verification systems have been shown to besensitive in some degree to signature complexity. Recognition rates ofsome systems drop when coping with easy to forge signatures whichare normally the readable ones. Therefore an automatic classificationscheme to separate between legible and nonlegible signatures wouldbe desirable in order to improve the general performance of theverification system. In this case two different recognition strategiescould be applied for legible and nonlegible signatures thus maximizingthe overall recognition rate.From a privacy point of view, signatures in which the name of the signeris readable could involve a special treatment to protect the identity ofthe signer. From this perspective, an automatic legibility classificationsystem would be relevant in order to adopt different measures for eachsignature depending on the specific legal guidelines for privacyprotection of each country.In this work an automatic classification scheme of online handwrittensignatures will be presented using a Multilayer Perceptron MLP with ahidden layer as classifier. Two different signature classes will beconsidered, namely legible and nonlegible name. Experimental resultswill be given on the MCYT signature database comprising 330 signers.653906, Session 3A new approach to handbased authentication systemG. Amayeh, G. N. Bebis, A. Erol, M. Nicolescu, Univ. of NevadaRenoHandbased authentication is a key biometric technology with a widerange of potential applications both in industry and government. Thefocus of this work is on improving the ease of use and accuracy ofhandbased authentication systems. Specifically, we employ highorderZernike moments to represent the segmented parts of the handsilhouette including the palm and the fingers. Segmentation allows us tocompensate for finger motion more effectively compared to the initial20 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssversion of this system that uses Zernike moments of the whole hand.Due to the rotation and translation invariance of the descriptors, thesimilarity between the query and the template is computed efficientlyusing Euclidean distance. The proposed handbased authenticationsystem has been tested on a database of 1000 images from 100subjects illustrating promising performance. Qualitative comparisonswith state of the art systems illustrate that the proposed system hascomparable or better performance.653907, Session 4Using support vector machines to eliminate falseminutiae matches during fingerprint verificationP. Mansukhani, S. Tulyakov, V. Govindaraju, Univ. at BuffaloTo compensate for the different orientations of two fingerprint images,matching systems use a reference point and a set of transformationparameters. Fingerprint minutiae are compared on their positionsrelative to the reference points, using a set of thresholds for the variousmatching features. However a pair of minutiae might have similar valuesfor some of the features compensated by dissimilar values for othersthis tradeoff cannot be modeled by arbitary thresholds, and might leadto a number of false matches. Instead given a list of potentialcorrespondences of minutiae points, we could use a static classifier,such as a support vector machine SVM to eliminate some of the falsematches. A 2class model is built using sets of minutiaecorrespondences from fingerprint pairs known to belong to the sameand different users. For a test pair of fingerprints, a similar set ofminutiae correspondences is extracted and given to the recognizer,using only those classified as genuine matches to calculate thesimilarity score, and thus, the matching result. We have builtrecognizers using different combinations of fingerprint features andhave tested them against the FVC 2002 database. Using this recognizerreduces the number of false minutiae matches by 19, while only 5of the minutiae pairs corresponding to fingerprints of the same user arerejected. We study the effect of such a reduction on the final error rate,using different scoring schemes.653908, Session 4Augmenting ridge curves with minutiae triplets forfingerprint indexingA. A. Ross, R. Mukherjee, West Virginia Univ.Given a query fingerprint, the goal of indexing is to identify and retrievea set of candidate fingerprints from a large database in order todetermine a possible match. This significantly improves the responsetime of fingerprint recognition systems operating in the identificationmode. In this work, we extend the indexing framework based onminutiae triplets by utilizing ridge curve parameters in conjunction withminutiae information to enhance indexing performance. Further, wedemonstrate that the proposed technique facilitates the indexing offingerprint images acquired using different sensors. Experiments on thepublicly available FVC database confirm the utility of the proposedapproach in indexing fingerprints.653909, Session 4Use of ridge points in partial fingerprint matchingG. Fang, S. N. Srihari, H. Srinivasan, P. Phatak, Univ. at BuffaloMatching of partial fingerprints has important applications in bothbiometrics and forensics. It is wellknown that the accuracy of minutiaebased matching algorithms dramatically decrease as the number ofavailable minutiae decreases. When singular structures such as coreand delta are unavailable, general ridges can be utilized. Some existinghighly accurate minutiae matchers do use local ridge similarity forfingerprint alignment. However, ridges cover relatively larger regions,and therefore ridge similarity models are sensitive to nonlineardeformation. An algorithm is proposed here to utilize ridges moreeffectively by utilizing representative ridge points. These points arerepresented similar to minutiae and used together with minutiae inexisting minutiae matchers with simple modification. Algorithmeffectiveness is demonstrated using both full and partial fingerprints.The performance is compared against two minutiaeonly matchersBozorth and kminutiae. Effectiveness with full fingerprint matching isdemonstrated using the four databases of FVC2002 where the errorrate decreases by 0.20.7 using the best matching algorithm. Theeffectiveness is more significant in the case of partial fingerprintmatching which is demonstrated with thirty partial fingerprintdatabases generated from FVC2002 with five levels of numbers ofminutiae available. When only 15 minutiae are available the error ratedecreases 57.5. Thus the method, which involves selectingrepresentative ridge points, minutiae matcher modification, and a groupof minutiae matchers, demonstrates improved performance on full andespecially partial fingerprint matching.653910, Session 4A geometric transformation to protect minutiaebasedfingerprint templatesY. Sutcu, H. T. Sencar, N. D. Memon, Polytechnic Univ.The increasing use of biometrics in different environments presents newchallenges. Most importantly, biometric data are irreplaceable.Therefore, storing biometric templates, which is unique to individualuser, entails significant security risks. In this paper, we propose a robustoneway transformation for securing the minutiae based fingerprinttemplates. The proposed scheme employs a oneway transformationthat maps geometrical configuration of the minutiae points into a fixedlength code vector. This representation enables efficient alignment andreliable matching. Experiments are conducted by applying the proposedmethod on a synthetically generated minutiae point sets. Preliminaryresults show that the proposed scheme provides a simple and effectivesolution to the template security problem of the minutiae basedfingerprint.653911, Session 5Correlation filters for large population face recognitionB. Vijaya Kumar, C. Xie, M. Savvides, Carnegie Mellon Univ.Reliable person recognition is important for secure access andcommercial applications requiring human identification. Facerecognition FR is an important technology being developed for humanidentification. Algorithms and systems for large population facerecognition LPFR are of significant interest in applications such aswatch lists and video surveillance. In this paper, we present correlationfiltersbased feature analysis methods to effectively exploit availablegeneric training data to represent a large number of subjects and thusimprove the performance for LPFR. We first introduce a generalframework  classdependence feature analysis CFA, which appliescorrelation filters to provide a discriminant feature representation forLPFR. We then introduce two variants of the correlation filterbased CFAmethods 1 the kernel correlation filter CFA KCFA that generatesnonlinear decision boundaries and significantly improves therecognition performance without greatly increasing the computationalload, and 2 the binary coding CFA that uses binary coding to reducethe number of correlation filters and applies error control coding ECCto improve the recognition performance. These two variants offer waysto tradeoff between the computational complexity and the recognitionaccuracy of the CFA methods. We test our proposed algorithms on theface recognition grand challenge FRGC database and show that thecorrelation filterbased CFA approach improves the recognition rate andreduces the computational load over the conventional correlation filters.653912, Session 5Application of superresolution to longrange face imagesY. Yao, B. R. Abidi, The Univ. of Tennessee N. D. Kalka, N. A.Schmid, West Virginia Univ. M. A. Abidi, The Univ. of TennesseeMost existing face recognition algorithms require face images to have aminimum resolution.  A resolution of 60 pixels between the eyes isrecommended by the wellknow recognition engine, FaceItr developedConf. 6539 Biometric Technology for Human Identification IV spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 21by Identix.  Meanwhile, the rapidly increasing need for nearground longrange surveillance calls for a migration in face recognition from closeupdistances to long distances and accordingly from low and constantresolution to high and adjustable resolution.  Although adjustable zoomcameras are commonly used in indoor and outdoor surveillance systems,most of them provide a maximum optical magnification in the range of2030 1.  For long range surveillance and target identification, thismagnification is insufficient to obtain the required number of pixels ontarget.  Superresolution SR can provide a promising solution with noadditional hardware requirements.  In this paper, a brief review of existingSR algorithms is conducted and their capabilities towards improving facerecognition rates FRR of long range face images are studied.Algorithms applicable to realtime scenarios 2, 3 are implemented andtheir performances in terms of FRR are examined using the IRISLDHMface database 4.    Our experimental results show that the use of SRfollowed by the proper enhancement, such as wavelet based processing,is able to achieve comparable FRR when equivalent optical zoom isemployed.  In addition, SR is capable of compensating certain amountsof illumination changes.  From our experiments, performanceimprovements similar to those using the Retinex algorithm are observedin terms of illumination variations.  This study lays the foundation for thedevelopment of pure image based SR algorithms for long range facerecognition applications.653913, Session 5Locality preserving projections as a new manifold analysisapproach for robust face superresolutionS. W. Park, M. Savvides, Carnegie Mellon Univ.In this paper, we propose a novel method for performing robust superresolution of face images by solving the practical problems of manifoldanalysis. The face superresolution is to recover a highresolution faceimage from a given lowresolution face image e.g. captured fromsurveillance footage by modeling the face image space. Thus, facesuperresolution should be preceded by analyzing the characters of theface image distribution. In literature, it has been shown that face imageslie on a nonlinear manifold, so if the manifold structure is taken intoconsideration for modeling the face image space, the results of facesuperresolution can be improved. However, there are some practicalproblems which prevent these algorithms from being applied to superresolution. Almost all of the manifold learning methods cannot generatemapping functions for new test images which are absent from a trainingset. Also, there exists another significant problem when applyingmanifold analysis to superresolution superresolution seeks to recover ahighdimensional image from a lowerdimensional one while manifoldlearning methods perform the exact opposite as they deal with findingrepresentative dimensionality reduction.To break those limitations of applying manifold analysis to superresolution, we propose a novel face superresolution method usingLocality Preserving Projections LPP. LPP gives an advantage over othermanifold learning methods in that it has welldefined linear projectionswhich allow us to formulate welldefined mappings between highdimensional data and lowdimensional data. Moreover, we show that wecan infer highresolution LPP coefficients for a given lowresolution testimage using a MAP estimator to produce better reconstruction imageswith highfrequency details.653914, Session 6Biometric identification a holistic perspectiveL.

Hube, L1 Identity SolutionsWe define the biometric performance invariance under injective functionson match scores as normalization symmetry. We use this symmetry toclarify the essential difference between the standard scorelevel fusionapproaches of sumrule and NeymanPearson. We then expressNeymanPearson fusion assuming match scores defined using falseacceptance rates on a logarithmic scale. We show that by statingNeymanPearson in this form, it reduces to sumrule fusion for ROCcurves with logarithmic slope. We also introduce a one parametermodel of biometric performance and use it to express NeymanPearsonfusion as a weighted sumrule.653916, Session 7Nonparametric statistical data analysis of fingerprintminutiae exchange with twofinger fusionJ. C. Wu, M. D. Garris, National Institute of Standards andTechnologyA nonparametric inferential statistical data analysis is presented.  Theutility of this method is demonstrated through analyzing results fromminutiae exchange with twofinger fusion.  Highaccuracy vendors areselected and mean error rates are compared between two modes ofmatching standard fingerprint templates 1 Native Matching  where thesame vendor generates the templates and the matcher, and 2 Scenario1 Interoperability  where vendor As enrollment template is matched tovendor Bs authentication template using vendor Bs matcher.  Thepurpose of this analysis is to make inferences about the underlyingpopulation from sample data, which provide insights at an aggregatelevel.  This is very different from the data analysis presented in theMINEX04 report in which vendors are only individually ranked andcompared.  Using the nonparametric bootstrap biascorrected andaccelerated BCa method, 95 confidence intervals are computed foreach mean error rate.  Nonparametric significance tests are thenapplied to further determine if the difference between two underlyingpopulations is real or by chance with a certain probability.  Results fromthis method show that at a 95 confidence there is a significantdegradation in accuracy of Scenario 1 Interoperability with respect toNative Matching with on average a twofold increase in False NonMatch Rate.  Additionally, it is proved why twofinger fusion using thesum rule is more accurater than singlefinger matching under the sameconditions.  Results of a simulation using the nonparametric bootstrapare also presented to show the significance of the confidence intervalsderived from the small size of samples, in our case, six vendors.653930, Session 7Empiricalmode decomposition for removal of specularreflections and cast shadow effectsR. Bhagavatula, M. Savvides, Carnegie Mellon Univ.Facial recognition is fast becoming one of the more popular andeffective modalities of biometrics when used in controlledenvironments. Controlled environments referring to those wherevariables such as facial expression, pose, relative camera position, andillumination effects are either completely or partially controlled in theinterest of improved performance. Regulation of such factors has animmediate effect on the performance of facial recognition algorithms, inparticular illumination effects which can not be controlled by even themost cooperative of users. In this paper we describe a method toaddress illumination effects in the biometric modality of face recognitionusing signal processing analysis such as Empirical ModeDecomposition EMD to identify illumination modes that compose theimage. After identifying the intrinsic mode function that corresponds tothe dominant illumination factors, we reconstruct the facial imagewithout these illumination distortion components to synthesize a moreneutral facial image. We then perform recognition and verificationexperiments using different algorithms such as Principal ComponentAnalysis PCA, Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis FLDA, andAdvanced Correlation Filters ACFs to demonstrate the fundamentaleffectiveness of EMD as an illumination compensation method.

Abiantun, M. Savvides, B. Vijaya Kumar, Carnegie Mellon Univ.In this paper we analyze and demonstrate the subspace generalizationpower of the kernel correlation feature analysis KCFA method forproducing compact low dimensional subspace that has goodrepresentation ability to work on unseen, untrained datasets. Examiningthe portability of an algorithm across different datasets is an importantpractical aspect of face recognition applications where the technologycannot be datasetdependant for practical realworld applications. Inmost face recognition literature, algorithms are demonstrated ondatasets by training on some part of the dataset and testing on theremainder. Most times the training and testing data have the samepeople but different capture sessions so in essence, some of theexpected variation and people are modeled in the training set. In thispaper we describe how we efficiently build a compact feature spaceusing kernel correlation filter analysis on the generic training set of theFRGC dataset, and test the built subspace on other wellknown facedatasets. We show that the feature subspace produced by KCFA hasgood representation and discrimination to unseen datasets andproduces good verification and identification rates compared to othersubspace methods such as PCA. Its efficiency, lower dimensionalitythe KCFA is only a 222 dimensional subspace and discriminativepower make it more practical and powerful than PCA as a powerfullower dimensionality reduction method for modeling faces and facialvariations.653918, Session 8Multistream face recognition for crime fightingS. A. Jassim, Univ. of Buckingham United Kingdom H. Sellahewa,Gray Cancer Institute United Kingdom and Univ. of BuckinghamUnited KingdomAutomatic face recognition is a useful tool in the fight against crime andterrorism. The use of Closedcircuit television CCTV cameras in publicplaces has increased dramatically over that last few years. It is oftenused for surveillance in areas where there is an increased need forsecurity such as airports, train stations, shopping centers, banks, sportarenas, and entertainment clubs. They are used to detect and preventcrime, shoplifting, public disorder, terrorism, and illegal immigration. Thework of lawenforcing and intelligence agencies is becoming morereliant on the use of databases of biometric data for large section of thepopulation as well as visitors. Face is one of the most natural biometrictraits that can be used for surveillance and automatic humanidentification. However, variations in lighting conditions, facialexpressions, face size and pose are a great obstacle to automatic facerecognition. This paper is concerned with the using waveletbased facerecognition schemes in the presence of variations of expressions andillumination. In particular, we will investigate the use of a combination ofwavelet frequency channels for multistream face recognition. Theproposed schemes extend our recently developed face verificationscheme for implementation on mobile devices. We shall demonstratethat the multistream approach is robust against variations inillumination and facial expressions than the previous singlestreamapproach. We shall present experimental results on the performance ofour proposed schemes for a number of publicly available facedatabases including a new AV database of videos recorded on a PDA.653919, Session 8Realtime face tracking and pose correction for facerecognition using active appearance modelsJ. Heo, M. Savvides, Carneige Mellon Univ.This paper presents a fully automatic realtime face recognition systemfrom video by using Active Appearance Models AAM for fitting andtracking facial fiducial landmarks and warping the nonfrontal faces intoa frontal pose. By implementing a face detector for locating suitableinitialization step of the AAM shape searching and fitting process, newfacial images are interpreted and tracked accurately in real time 15fps.Using an Active Appearance Model AAM for normalizing facial imagesunder different poses and expressions is crucial to providing improvedface recognition performance as most systems degrade matchingperformance with even smallest pose variation. Furthermore the AAM isa more robust feature registration tracking approach as most systemsdetect and locate the eyes while AAMs detect and track multiplefiducial points on the face holistically. We show examples of AAM fittingand tracking and pose normalization including an illumination preprocessing step to remove specular and cast shadow illuminationartifacts on the face.  We show example pose normalization images aswell as example matching scores showing the improved performance ofthis pose correction method.653920, Session 9Similarity measure functions for strategybasedbiometricsR. V. Yampolskiy, V. Govindaraju, Univ. at BuffaloFunctioning of a biometric system in large part depends on theperformance of the similarity measure function. Frequently ageneralized similarity distance measure function such as Euclidiandistance or Mahalanobis distance is applied to the task of matchingbiometric feature vectors. However, often accuracy of a biometricsystem can be greatly improved by designing a customized matchingalgorithm optimized for a particular biometric application. In this paperwe propose a tailored similarity measure function for behavioralbiometric systems based on the expert knowledge of the feature leveldata in the domain. We compare performance of a proposed matchingalgorithm to that of other well known similarity distance functions anddemonstrate its superiority with respect to the chosen domain.In this paper we compared three general similarity measure functionsEuclidian, Mahalanobis, Manhattan with two domain specific functionsdeveloped by us Weighted Euclidian, 2D Style. We begin with anoverview of strategy based behavioral biometrics. This is followed by asurvey of the most popular similarity measure functions used inbiometric applications. Finally, we present our similarity measurefunctions and describe experiments we performed in order to establishthe best performing similarity distance function. Customized WeightedEuclidian measure function specifically designed for the domain ofstrategybased behavioral profiles showed the best performance on alltypes of data representation. This similarity measure function improvedalgorithms verification accuracy to as low as the 7 EER for thebehavioral profiles enhanced with temporal and spatial information.653922, Session 9An eye model for uncalibrated eye gaze estimation undervariable head poseJ. M. Hnatow, A. E. Savakis, Rochester Institute of TechnologyGaze estimation is an important component of computer vision systemsthat monitor human activity for surveillance, humancomputerinteraction, and other applications. Gaze estimation methods that arenonintrusive, do not require calibration, and generalize well acrossusers are particularly valuable for such systems.This paper presents a novel eye model that is employed for efficientlyperforming uncalibrated eye gaze estimation. The proposed eye modelwas constructed from a geometric simplification of the eye andanthropometric data about eye feature sizes in order to circumvent therequirement of calibration procedures for each individual user. Thepositions of the two eye corners and the midpupil, the distancebetween the two eye corners, and the radius of the eye sphere arerequired for gaze angle calculation. The locations of the eye cornersand midpupil are estimated via processing following eye detection, andthe remaining parameters are obtained from anthropometric data. Thiseye model is easily extended to estimating eye gaze under variablehead pose.The eye model was tested on still images of subjects at frontal pose 0degrees and side pose 34 degrees. An upper bound of the modelsperformance was obtained by manually selecting the eye featureConf. 6539 Biometric Technology for Human Identification IV spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 23locations. The resulting average absolute error was 2.98 degrees forfrontal pose and 2.87 degrees for side pose. The error was consistentacross subjects, which indicates that good generalization was obtained.This level of performance compares well with other gaze estimationsystems that utilize a calibration procedure to measure eye features.653925, Poster SessionIndexing biometric database of binary feature templateP. Gupta, A. Sana, H. Mehrotra, Indian Institute of TechnologyKanpur IndiaIndexing is required to reduce the search zone of large biometricdatabase which in turn reduces the response time for an identificationsystem. The paper proposes an efficient indexing technique for uniquebinary feature template using Haar wavelet transform. In this techniquethe input image is decomposed into approximation, vertical, horizontaland diagonal coefficients using the wavelet transform and theapproximation coefficient is further decomposed into four coefficients.The extracted approximation coefficient matrix is binarised. This binarymatrix is divided into four quadrants of equal size and Hammingdistance HD between each quadrant with the chosen unique sampletemplate is calculated. Each HD is used to generate a key in a certainrange. The upper and lower range values for four quadrants are insertedinto B tree where root node is unique sample template. At the firstlevel of the tree the node contains the lower and upper values for firstquadrant only. Similarly, lower and upper range values for the threequadrants are stored in the second, third and fourth level respectively.Finally leaf node contains the identifier.In the case of identification, test image is used for generation of HD forfour quadrants. Then the B tree is traversed comparing the values ofHD at every node. If these HD lie within the range of values of existingnodes then it terminates to a leaf node with a set of identifiers. Thecorresponding feature vector for each identifier is retrieved from thesecondary memory and matched with test feature template to get topmatches. The proposed technique is implemented on ear biometricdatabase at IITK.653928, Poster SessionTemplate protection and its implementation in 3D facerecognition systemsX. Zhou, FraunhoferInstitut fr Graphische DatenverarbeitungGermanyAs biometric recognition systems are widely employed in differentapplication areas, security and privacy risks have recently attracted theattention of the biometric community. Template protection techniquesprevent stored reference data from revealing biometric information andenhance the security of biometric systems against attacks such asidentity theft and cross matching. This paper concentrates on atemplate protection algorithm that merges methods from cryptography,error correction coding and biometrics. The key component of thealgorithm is to convert biometric templates into binary vectors. Thepaper shows that the binary vectors should be robust, uniformlydistributed, statistically independent and collisionfree so thatverification performance can be optimized. Depending on statisticalcharacter of the biometric template, different approaches fortransforming biometric templates into compact binary vectors arepresented. The proposed methods are integrated into a 3D faceverification system  and tested on the FRGC 3D face database. It isshown that resulting binary vector provides  verification performancecomparable to the original 3D face templates. A high security level canbe achieved with reasonable false acceptance and false rejection ratesof the system, based on an efficient statistical analysis. The algorithmestimates the statistical character of biometric templates from a numberof biometric samples in the enrollment database. For the FRGC 3D facedatabase, classification results under the assumption of uniquelydistributed templates are more successful than for Gaussian distributedtemplates in our tests.653929, Poster SessionEar authentication using logGabor waveletsA. Kumar, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi India D. Zhang, TheHong Kong Polytechnic Univ. Hong Kong ChinaThis paper investigates a new approach for human ear identificationusing holistic greylevel information. We employ logGabor filters toextract the phase information, i.e. earcodes, from the 1D graylevelsignals. Thus each ear is represented by a unique ear code or phasetemplate. The query ear images are compared with those in thedatabase using hamming distance. The minimum hamming distanceobtained from the rotation of earcodetemplate is used to authenticatethe user. Our experiments on three different ear database achievespromising results and suggests its utility in earbased authentication.1. IntroductionReliability in personal authentication is key to the stringent securityrequirements in many application domains ranging from airportsurveillance to electronic banking. Many physiological characteristics ofhumans, i.e., biometrics, are typically invariant over time, easy toacquire, and unique to each individual. Most of the current research inbiometrics is focussed on face, fingerprint, gait, signature, iris,palmprint or handgeometry 11. However, there have been very littleefforts to investigate the human ear for personal authentication despiteits significant role in forensic science. The ear is quite attractivebiometric candidate mainly due to its i rich and stable structure whichis preserved since birth, ii being invariable to the changes in pose andfacial expression, and iii relatively immune from anxiety, privacy andhygiene problems with several other biometric candidates.1.1 Prior WorkTable 1 presents a summary of prior work on the usage of 2D earimages for personal authentication. Researchers have also investigatedthe ear recognition using 3D imaging 6, 10 and acousticcharacteristics 7.Authors  Approach  Classifier  Database Size A.

Proposed MethodThe accurate ear recognition requires the extraction of mostdiscriminating information and exclusion masking of those regions thatdo not form the reliable features. Our approach extracts the reliable earfeatures using LogGabor filters and generates a phase template tocharacterize phase information. Figure 1 shows the block diagram ofproposed approach for ear authentication.3. Experiments and ResultsThe experiments reported in this paper utilize the face databaseavailable at 11. We employed the side face images of 116 subjects andextracted the ROI using a fixed size mask as shown in Figure 1.4. ConclusionsThis paper has presented a new approach for ear authentication usingphase information extracted from Log Gabor wavelets. The preliminaryexperimental results shown in this paper are promising. These resultsalso suggest that the exploitation of Gabor phase information performssignificantly better that the eigenear approach presented in theliterature. This paper will also provide detailed analysisdiscussioncomparison on the distribution of genuine and imposter scores, fromthe proposed method, for the performance evaluation.5. References1. A.

Highlights will include discussions thatsignificant portions of the RD budgets lay outside the Department ofHomeland Security. An overview of this conference will include anoverview of the program as well as an update on the Port and HarborSecurity and Drinking Water Safety subcommittees.654002, Session 2Combination of an online biomonitor using light emittingbacteria and a UV spectrometer probe for homelandsecurity and drinking water safetyJ. Appels, microLAN B.V. NetherlandsAnalytical Monitoring systems can only cover a part of the range ofpotential contamination in water. Therefore the interest in the last yearsin online Biomonitors has increased significantly. This has resulted inthe introduction of new Biomonitors which can provide a near realtimeinformation on water quality. They can also be used for drinking waterprotection against Intential Contamination. But still no universal monitoris available which protects against all kinds of threats and acombination of systems and techniques is required if all criteria are tobe met. This can not be realised with the use of a single monitor.However, the combination of complementary systems into a singleintegrated monitoring platform will greatly enhance the applicability ofreal time monitoring devices for water quality monitoring.For this the TOXcontrol, a biological toxicity monitor usingluminescence bacteria with the SCAN spectrolyserTM, an analyticalsensor a submersible UVVIS spectrophotometer probe will becombined and a software tool will help the user to make betterjudgements and give more insight information to make decisions. Thiscombination allows verification of alarm signals from one instrumentwith the signal of others reducing false alarm rates.After a study it was concluded that both the UVVIS spectrophotometerand the Toxicity Biomonitor are valuable sensors in an Water SecurityMonitoring System, capable of detection a broad range of contaminantsat low concentrations. Results of both lab and field tests for HomelandSecurity and Drinking Water Safety monitoring, will be presented.654003, Session 2AquaSentinel a realtime reagentless biosensor systemfor standoff detection and classification of toxins insource waterE. Greenbaum, M. Rodriguez, Jr., Oak Ridge National Lab.AquaSentinel is an automated and fielddeployable realtimetechnology for detection of source water environmental toxins that isbased on the fluorescence induction properties of algae that grownaturally in the water.  We report here that the algal biosensors can beused as a sentinel alarm system based on toxininduced fluorescencereadout as the characteristic signature for identification and verificationof environmental pollutants in source drinking waters.  This reagentlessselfcontained optoelectronic detection system naturally lends itself tomapping and ranging of the presence of pollutants in source waters.We have developed an original algorithm for performing the analysis ofthe readings from the biosensors.  The approach is based on differentialoffset between the fluorescence signatures of healthy algae and that ofthe poisoned algae.  The technique yields a set of timedependentnumbers that uniquely maps the transformation of the normal or healthyfluorescence induction curve to that of the poisoned curve.  We showthat the set of numbers generates a characteristic signature that can beused to group and identify the specific pollutant that caused thealteration of the fluorescence.  Data on five wellknown toxins will bepresented cyanide, methyl parathion, atrazine, diuron and paraquat.This data was generated from doseresponse experiments performedwith as is water samples collected from the Clinch River.  The Clinchis the primary source of drinking water for the City of Oak Ridge,Tennessee.654004, Session 2Rapid response toxicity and chemical agent kits for initialthreat assessmentD. C. Deardorff, AbraxisAssays based on the measurement of bacterial luminescence are widelyused in ecotoxicology.  Luminescence is connected to the metabolismof the bacteria, if the metabolism is obstructed or totally stopped deathof the bacteria by a toxic sample the level of luminescence decreases.Bioluminescent bacteria kits based on the V. fischeri strain NRRL B11177 are excellent tools in responding either to general toxicity or aspecific chemical threat. They are rapid, costeffective and easy to use.With prior generation instrument technology, capital equipment outlaysranging from 8,000 to 22,000 have long been a barrier to waterquality or rapid response personnel.  New, less expensive technologiesincluding portable luminometers and camera detection systems makethe chemical threat assessment as easy as taking a picture.Enzymatic test kits, generally designed to be handheld and portable,detect the presence of chemical agents, carbamate pesticides, andorOP pesticides by relying on the reaction of the cholinesterase enzyme.Under normal conditions, the enzyme reacts as expected with otherchemicals present in the test kit. The activity of the enzyme is inhibited,however, by chemical agents, carbamate pesticides, and OP pesticides.The effects of this inhibition will then generally lead to a color change,indicating the presence or absence of these compounds.  Arecombinant acetyl cholinesterase enzyme allows the highly sensitivedetection of nerve agents, organophosphate and carbamates chemicalagents at the sub ppb levels.New developments on low cost bioluminescence and enzymatic assaysthat can be used to determine rapid acute toxicity of chemical agents toassess threats as well as data obtained from EPA EnvironmentalTechnology Verification ETV will be presented.654005, Session 2Nectophotometer an infrared motility monitor used torapidly quantify toxicityR. W. Lo Pinto, J. Santelli, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ.Changes in the motility of fish and aquatic invertebrates have long beenused to signal the presence of toxins in water.  We have discovered thatthe level of motility change occurring within 2.5 hours of exposure toeach concentration of toxin correlates well with the mortality observedat each concentration after a three day exposure. This correlation allowsmortality and EC50s to be determined near the beginning of a toxicitytest rather than at its conclusion.  Motility is monitored andautomatically recorded using a Nectophotometer, an automated biomonitor with computer interface that senses interruptions of infraredbeams when organisms separately exposed to multiple concentrationsof a toxin move through the beams.  In our tests changes in the motilityof Artemia salina within the first 2.5 hours of exposure predict 3 daymortality with an average accuracy of 89.33.  The Nectophotometerhas promise for allowing rapid assessment of the toxicity of liquidsusing invertebrates and fish, and may also be used to assess airbornetoxicity if motile insects respond in a similar manner.26 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654006, Session 2Water security continuous monitoring of waterdistribution systems for chemical agents by SERSS. R. Farquharson, F. E. Inscore, RealTime Analyzers, Inc.Ensuring safe water supplies requires continuous monitoring forpotential poisons.  In the case of chemical warfare agents CWAsanalyzers are needed that have sufficient sensitivity microgramliter,selectivity differentiate the CWA from its hydrolysis products, andspeed less than 10 minutes to be of value.  We have been investigatingthe ability of surfaceenhanced Raman spectroscopy SERS to meetthese requirements by detecting CWAs and their hydrolysis products inwater.  The expected success of SERS is based on reported detectionof single molecules, the onetoone relationship between a chemicaland its Raman spectrum, and the minimal sample preparationrequirements.  Recently, we have developing a simple sampling devicedesigned to optimize the interaction of the target molecules with theSERSactive material with the goal of increasing sensitivity anddecreasing sampling times.  This sampling device employs a syringe todraw the water sample containing the analyte into a capillary filled withthe SERSactive material.  Recently we used such SERSactivecapillaries to measure 1 microgL cyanide in water.  Here we willdescribe these measurements as well as those for blister and nerveagent hydrolysis products, and portable analyzers suitable forcontinuous water monitoring.654007, Session 3Use of robotics and EOIR sensors for border securityR.

Recent advances in polymer research and nanoscale fabricationmethods along with advances in optical polarimetric remote sensingsystems suggest a solution.  The basic device uses a microwiregridinfrared polarizer fabricated in conductive polymer.  When the polymeris exposed to hard radiation, its conductivity will be affected and thepolarization properties of the device will change in a correspondingmanner.  This change in polarization properties can be determined byoptically interrogating the device, possibly from a remote location.  Wewill report on the development of a radiationsensitive passivedosimeter polymer with very low optical visibility.  Progress on materialdevelopment, lithographic fabrication and optical characterization willbe presented.654009, Session 3Truecolor night vision camerasJ. M. Kriesel, OptoKnowledge Systems, Inc. N. Gat, OptoKnowledge Systems, Inc.The paper describes TrueColor Night Vision cameras that are sensitiveto the visible to nearinfrared VNIR portion of the spectrum allowing forthe truecolor of scenes and objects to be displayed and recordedunder low light level conditions.  True Color technology offersadvantages over traditional monochrome gray or green imageintensified cameras that have been the standard for years.  Forexample, color increases information content and has proven to enablebetter situational awareness, faster response time, and more accuratetarget identification.Two different prototype cameras, employing two different truecolornight vision technological approaches, are described and compared inthis paper.  One camera uses a fastswitching liquid crystal filter withoptimized transmission profiles in front of a custom GenIII imageintensified CMOS camera.  The construction of color images isperformed onboard the cameras using a fast DSP or FPGA enablingcolor video output at 30 framessecond.  The second camera is basedaround an EMCCD sensor with a mosaic filter applied directly to thesensor.  In addition to visible light, both cameras can utilize NIR to 1increase the signal and 2 enable the viewing of laser aiming devices.The performance of the truecolor cameras, along with the performanceof standard monochrome night vision cameras, are reported andcompared under various operating conditions in the lab and the field.  Inaddition to subjective criterion, figures of merit designed specifically forthe objective assessment of such cameras are used in this analysis.654010, Session 3Enhanced surveillance system based on panomorphpanoramic lensesS. Thibault, ImmerVision CanadaModern surveillance and security systems must be based on atechnological approach because only technology can provide vigilancewith efficiency and can supply certainty of detection and fast responseone hundred percent of the time.  The development of new wide anglelenses, advanced cameras, IP networks and video analysis technology,provide great improvements in system performance and flexibility.  Thispaper presents a new advanced surveillance system based on the useof a panoramic Panomorph lens for event detection, recognition andidentification over 360 degrees with 100 coverage rate.  Thisinnovative approach provides enhanced performance with better pixelcost ratio.  Intelligent video technology enables the video camera to bemore than just a video camera.  Intelligent video technology allows thepanoramic image to follow events such as moving objects orunauthorized behaviors in real time.  This in turn helps the operator tofocus their activity on a narrow field pantilt camera, without loosing anyinformation in the field.  Incrementally adding capabilities such as apanomorph lens based imager to an existing surveillance video systemcan provide improvements in operational efficiency and effectiveness.Foreseen applications are in the field of border surveillance, highlysecured environments, aerospace and defense, mass transit, publicsecurity and wherever the need for total awareness is required.654011, Session 3360 degrees optical systemW.

The current solutions available in the market are mainlybased on multiple camera system, rotating camera system andparabolic camera system. These solutions are either more expensive,higher in power consumption, lower in reliability, not real time, morecomplex in software, large distorted images or lower in imageresolution.The reason is because typical commercial imaging detector or camerahas a standard format of 43 aspect ratios. This determines thehorizontal field of view HFOV and vertical field of view VFOV with thesame aspect ratio. Hence, such detector is not suitable for panoramicview. The detector should be of higher aspect ratios such as 81.5 or160.75.  However, even if there is an elongated detector, the optics willbe complex and design difficult to optimise.Conf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 27The paper shall present an innovative solution to provide a lowdistortion and high resolution panoramic view in real time and under lowlight condition.

Kakauridze, Institute of CyberneticsGeorgiaPolarizationholographic system of protection of a new type is offered.The system uses specially synthesized polarizationsensitive materialson which the polarization holograms are recorded and the identifyingdevice. The polarization holographic method uses an essentially biggerpossibility that lies in light wave polarization. Polarization hologram isable to record all characteristics of the polarization ellipse  ellipticity,direction of rotation and orientation of the major axis, as well as adegree of polarization. Such an ample quantity of the initial datarecorded on the material carrier makes it possible to record respectivelyphysically as much complete information as possible. Polarizationhologramslabels are recorded by two polarized beams with differentpolarization state. As there are infinitely many combinations ofpolarization state of writing beams, then while using the material withcertain characteristics a specific combination can be chosen for eachconcrete system of protection to which diffracted beams with aconcrete polarization state will unambiguously correspond. Theidentifying device forms an illuminating beam, makes an analysis ofpolarization state of beams diffracted on the hologramlabel andcompares their state of polarization with the standard for the givenconcrete system of protection. The polarizationholographic elementcreated by us is used in device for the analysis of polarization state ofdiffracted beams. It gives the possibility to determine all parameters ofpolarization ellipses of diffracted beams simultaneously and in real time.The suggested system has advantage that visually protectivepolarization hologramlabels look completely homogeneous. It isimpossible to determine by any devices usually used for verification ofauthenticity ultraviolet and infrared irradiation, magnetic and electricalfields, microscopes etc. what is written on the given hologramlabels. Itis easy to determine the authenticity only while using the identifyingdevice, designed by us. Besides unlike existing holographic protectionsystems an essential advantage of such a system of protection is that itis impossible to copy polarization hologramlabels by optical methodsas registering material has high absorption on actinic wavelength andthe irreversible destruction of the recorded information occurs while bigpower density of the actinic illuminating light is used. This system issimple enough and noise protected.654015, Session 4DHS CounterMANPADS Program updateK. D.

In civil aviation, thegeneral hazards linked to the use of pyrotechnics is the main argumentagainst expendable countermeasures, whereas for military platforms,the limitation in capacity due to a limited number of rounds is oftenused as an argument to replace expendable countermeasures by laserbased countermeasures. This latter argument is in general notsubstantiated by modeling or figures of merit, although it is often arguedthat a laser based system allows for more false alarms, hence enablinga more sensitive missile approach warning system. The author hasdeveloped a model to determine the statistical effects of running out ofexpendable countermeasures during a mission, in terms of the overallmission survival probability. The model includes key parameters of themissile approach warning system MAWS, and can handle multiplemissile types and missile attack configurations, as well as variousstatistical models of missile attacks. The model enables quantitativecomparison between laser based and expendable countermeasures,but also a dynamic optimization of the countermeasures in terms ofwhether to use small or large countermeasure programs, as well as thedynamic tuning of MAWS key parameters to optimize the overallperformance.Example calculations are made to illustrate the effect of implementingthis model in new defensive aids suites.654020, Session 4Advances in Raman spectroscopy for explosiveidentification in aviation securityJ. D. Santillan, Ahura Corp.In the operational airport environment, the rapid identification ofpotentially hazardous materials such as improvised explosive devices,chemical warfare agents and flammable and explosive liquids isincreasingly critical. Peroxidebased explosives pose a particularlyinsidious threat because they can be made from relatively innocuoushousehold chemicals, such as bleach and hydrogen peroxide.  Ramanspectroscopy has been validated as a valuable tool for rapididentification of chemicals, explosives, and narcotics while allowinglineofsight interrogation through bottles or other translucentcontainers.  This enables safe identification of both precursorsubstances, such as acetone, and endproducts, such as TATP, withoutsampling by security personnel.While traditional Raman systems are laboratorybased, expensive andrequire careful operation and maintenance, recent advances inspectroscopic technologies have dramatically reduced the footprint andimproved the reliability and ease of use of Raman spectroscopysystems.  Such technologies are not only bringing the lab to the field,but are also protecting security personnel in the process.From this talk, participants will gain A basic understanding of Raman spectroscopy.

MSL is designed to enablesystemlevel experiments and datadriven modeling in the complexenvironment of a tidal estuary.  The initial focus of the laboratory is onthe threats posed by divers and small craft with hostile intent. Thelaboratory is, however, evolvable to future threats as yet unidentified.Initially, the laboratory utilizes acoustic, environmental, and videosensors deployed in and around the Hudson River estuary.  Dataassociated with boats and divers are collected on a special purposecomputer deployed on board a boat specifically designed and equippedfor these experiments.  The experiments are controlled remotely from aVisualization Center on campus. Early experiments utilizing thislaboratory have gathered data to characterize the relevant parametersof the estuary, acoustic signatures of divers, and normal surface and airtraffic.  Individual hydrophones were deployed to collect data to enablethe development of methodologies for maximizing SCUBA diverdetection distance.Initial results involving characteristics of the estuary, signatures ofdivers, ambient acoustic noise in an urban estuary and its correlationwith water traffic, and transmission loss of acoustic signals in a widefrequency band are presented.  These results will enablecharacterization of abnormal traffic and improvement of underwatercommunication in shallow water estuary.This work was supported by ONR Award  N000140510632 NavyForce Protection Technology Assessment Project.654023, Session 5Houston ship channel security a case studyP. A. Bellamy, H. Q. Le, S. S. S. Pei, Univ. of HoustonThe Houston Ship Channel is a major port with a uniquely critical rolewith respect to the US petroleum energy supply. The Channel securitysystem is currently being considered for a major and comprehensiveupgrade under the auspices of the Houstonbased Port StrategicSecurity Council. This paper describes a theoretical study of technicalissues in support of this project. The ultimate objective is a stateoftheart command, control, communication, information, and surveillancesystem for total situational awareness to address the FBIs Channelthreat matrix. The fundamental metric is the level of risk reduction. Thechallenge is to achieve orderofmagnitude improvement in intrusiondetection and the capability to mitigate CBRNE threats. The keyaspects include an advanced sensor network and response systemsupported by a highcapacity internetworking infrastructure. The studyconsiders not only existing advanced CBRNE detectors andsurveillance sensor suites that include fenceboundary sensors andvolumetric sensors including focal plane array imagers of variousspectral bands UVVIS, MLWIR, RADAR, and SONAR, but alsoemerging technologies e. g. 3D imagers that may become availableover the system lifetime. Sensor fusion and video analytics areanticipated to grow significantly. The response capability will includeboat patrols and robots. The system must also be designed not only fornormal operational environment day, night, regular weather but also forhazardous weather tornadoes, hurricanes. The true and ultimatechallenge however is to achieve the minimum risk given the allocatedbudget to achieve a system that serves the Channel at least for adecade to come.Conf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 29654024, Session 6A smart camera system for fixed facility securitysurveillanceJ.

J. Harper, M. L. Dock, Nomadics, Inc.The presence of underwater unexploded Ordnance UUXO represents aconsiderable threat in the marine environment. Elevated concentrationsof dissolved explosive compounds, such as TNT and RDX, may beproduced in the vicinity of degraded UUXO shell casings and are knownto have significant toxicant effects on local marine organisms. DuringWorld War II and in subsequent years, the US military inadvertently or, insome cases intentionally, deposited many thousands of tons of UUXOin US coastal waters. Much of this material is difficult to locate bymagnetometry or sonar imaging techniques, and can be extremelychallenging to identify by visual means after lying on the bottom of theocean for several decades. The present work is focused on advances inunderwater olfaction, wherein trace amounts of dissolved explosivecompounds may be detected and discriminated from other chemicalspecies found in the marine environment, for the purpose ofestablishing safe cordons andor neutralization of the explosives.ICx Nomadics has developed the first known realtime sensor systemthat is capable of detecting chemical signatures emanating fromunderwater explosives. The SeaPup sensor, which is based on thefluorescencequenching transduction mechanism of an amplifyingfluorescent polymer AFP, is capable of realtime detection of the tracechemical signatures emanating from submerged explosive compounds.The SeaPup system has been successfully tested on various marineplatforms, including a crawler robot, an autonomous underwater vehicleAUV, and a remotely operated underwater vehicle ROV. In one study,the SeaPup was shown to effectively map liquid phase explosive scentplumes emanating from an underwater source of TNT.  The presentedpaper will provide an overview of the history, current status, and futuredevelopment of explosive analyte detection in the underwaterenvironment.654027, Session 6Low cost MEMS hydrophonesK. J. Rebello, D. Kitchin, R. Henrick, F. Tejada, Johns Hopkins Univ.One of the principal problems faced today by the Department ofHomeland Security is maritime security.  Seaborne and underseathreats from terrorists and smugglers at ports and in coastal areasthreaten our safety and economy.  A solution is the development ofdistributed hydrophone sensors, but recent studies have shown thatthese systems prove too expensive and power hungry for large scaledeployment in sensor arrays of order hundred elements or more.A new approach for microelectromechanical systems MEMShydrophones is discussed, which yields miniature, low power, and highperformance hydrophones.  The prototype devices use a laserinterferometer with integrated low power electronics built onconventional silicon on sapphire SOS complimentary metal oxidesemiconductor CMOS technology to optically detect pressure waves.Results show sensitivities better than 10 VPa, comparable to or betterthan piezoelectric or capacitive condenser approaches.  The implicationis to make very low cost hydrophones while drastically reducing thepower and computational requirements of acoustic arrays this isviewed as a disruptive technology for areas where cost, size and powerconsumption are key.654028, Session 6Lowdose optically stimulated luminescence of exoticmaterialsD. I. GodfreySmith, S. M. Khanna, Defence Research andDevelopment Canada CanadaWe present the results of optically stimulated luminescence OSLanalyses of the radiation dose response of substrates and nonconductors present in ubiquitous small consumer electronics  watches,cell phones, small portable radios, laptops, and miscellaneousperipherals related to them onbody or inbody medical deviceshearing aids, pacemakers and in exotic materials SiC and AlNsubstrates currently under development for future generationelectronics.  Our experimental protocol included exposure of thematerials described above to a calibrated 90Sr90Y beta source with a0.13 Gys dose rate, and detection of the absorbed dose usingstimulation with 40mW of monochromatic light from an array of bluelight emitting diodes. Dose response luminescence was detected in aUV band centered at 340nm.  Preliminary data from several of thesematerials have yielded an excellent signal, in some cases yielding astatistically meaningful response to sublethal radiation doses of 0.004 0.02 Gy, and linear dose response behaviour over a wide dose range.The results could be used in a wide range of forensic radiation detectionsituations, including the detection of asymmetric threats before theirfruition, rapid response to radiation exposure events involving thegeneral population, and needs for triage.654029, Session 6Sensing and characterization of explosive vapors near700 cm1A. R. Ford, W. A. Burns, S. W. Reeve, Arkansas State Univ.Optical sensing of trace atmospheric constituents is now a wellestablished field.  For example, the HITRAN High ResolutionTransmission Molecular Absorption database contains spectra over1.7 million spectral transitions for 37 different molecules.  Thisextensive database provides a ready means for sensing and extractingatmospheric species concentrations via a principal component analysisfrom absorption spectra.  The extension of these same techniques tothe field of explosive detection has been proposed by a number ofscientists.  One of the challenges that must be overcome however isthat the vapor pressures of most explosive compounds is quite small.The gold standard in explosives detection is still the trained caninenose.  Recent studies have indicated that canines alert not on a specificexplosive compound, but rather on the chemicals used to manufactureand process the explosives.   Here we will present high resolutioninfrared data for several of these volatile organic compounds in the 700cm1 region that is required for real time optical sensing of energeticmaterials as well as a preliminary principal component analysis of asample in a real world matrix.Conf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III30 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654030, Session 6Automatic high throughput empty ISO containerverificationA.

Pratt, B. K. Baldauf, Northrop Grumman Space TechnologyDeriving water constituents water clarity, turbidity, bottom type anddepth from remote sensing continues to be a challenge in coastalwaters. Because relatively large regions can be observed in a shortamount of time, the development of data integration techniques tocombine multiple elements from satellite and airborne sensors ieAVIRIS, Hyperion, EOS, MODIS and NPOESS is highly desirable.Proficient implementation is also multifaceted. As concerns forhomeland security have elevated to higher priority, characterization oflittoral domains has moved from being driven by environmentallysensitive issues to politically vital matters. In the vulnerable transitionalarea between ocean and land there exists a void of defined parameters,confident characterization and reliable strategies for operationalanalysis. This paper surveys traditional optical and photonic techniquesfor the classification of maritime features, predominantly in the 0 to 100meter depth range. We discuss the most recent methods and comparethem by water depth and practicality as well as present the inherentphysical limitations and constraints.

P. Barzilov, P. C. Womble, I. Novikov, J. Paschal, J. Board, K.Moss, Western Kentucky Univ.The emergent threat of improvised nuclear and radiological dispersaldevices has elevated the demand for autonomous radiologicaldetection sensors that have a costeffective and operationallyeffectivedesign. They should provide high sensitivity and low false alarms. Weare developing a system of wireless radiological sensors that canoperate in common network architecture. The system is intended forgammaray detection and automatic identification of nuclear materialsand radioactive isotopes. The sensor is a gammaray spectrometer thatuses wireless technology to distribute the results. A smallsize sensormodule contains a lanthanum halide detector or other scintillationdetector along with a credit card size data acquisition system, PDA,battery, and WiFi radio or a cell phone modem. The PDA with customdata acquisition and analysis software analyzes the accumulatedspectrum on realtime basis and returns results to the screen reportingthe isotopic composition and intensity of detected radiation source. Thesystem has been programmed to mitigate false alarms from medicalisotopes and naturally occurring radioactive materials. The decisionmaking software can be trained to indicate specific signatures ofradiation sources like SNM. Results are stored in timestamped files inthe memory of the sensor, and transmitted to a remote computerdatabase. The sensor is supplied with GPS tracker coupling radiologicalinformation with geographical coordinates. The sensor is designed foreasy use and rapid deployment. The paper describes the design anddevelopment of a network of wireless gammaray sensors based on cellphone or WiFi technology.654035, Session 6An underwater system for explosive detectionV. Valkovic, D. Sudac, Institut Ruder Bokovic Croatia D. Matika,Institute for Researches and Development of Defense SystemsCroatia G. Nebbia, S. Pesente, Istituto Nazionale di FisicaNucleare ItalyThe location of an object on the bottom of the shallow coastal seawater is performed by optical means as well as by using data obtainedfrom sonar and magnetometer. Once the presence of the anomaly isconfirmed it is necessary to establish if it contains explosive charge.This task could be performed by using neutron sensor whose vertex isinstalled at the end of a retractable robotic arm. When positioned abovethe object, or to its side, the system inspects the object for thepresence of the explosive by using 14 MeV neutrons.Various versions of neutron sensor for the detection of explosivepresence in the underwater object are characterized by the choice ofsealed tube dt neutron generator  with or without detection ofassociated alpha particles and gamma detector low or high energyresolution.In order to evaluate various components and geometries a test basincontaining sea water and sand was constructed. Components of theneutron sensor were placed inside a waterproof stainless steel boxwhich could be moved up and down inside the basin.Measurements were performed with sealed neutron generators with andwithout detection of associated alpha particles. Low energy resolutiongamma detectors BGO and NaI were used. Monte Carlo calculationswere performed for the design of the best shield between the detectorand the neutron source.Conf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 31The most common military explosives are characterized by H, C, N, Oconcentration ratios.

P. Gordon, Sandia National Labs.Terrorists intent on causing many deaths and severe disruption to oursociety could, in theory, cause hundreds to tens of thousands of deathsand significant contamination of key urban facilities by using biologicalor chemical agents.  The attacks that have occurred to date, such asthe 1995 Aum Shinrikyo chemical and biological CB attacks and the2001 Anthrax letters, have been very small on the scale of what ispossible.  In order to defend against and mitigate the impacts of largescale terrorist attacks, defensive systems for protection of urban areasand highvalue facilities from biological and chemical threats have beendeployed.  This presentation will review analyses of such scenarios andthe efficacy of potential response options, will discuss defensivesystems that have been deployed and detection systems that are beingtested, and finally will outline the detection systems that will be neededfor improved CB defense in the future.

Heller, Univ. of CaliforniaSan DiegoOne of the grand challenges in nanotechnology is the development offabrication technologies that will lead to cost effectivenanomanufacturing processes. In addition to the more classical topdown processes such as photolithography, socalled bottomupprocesses are also being developed for carrying out selfassembly ofmolecules and nanostructures into higherorder materials and devices.To this end, considerable efforts have been carried out on LayerbyLayer LBL selfassembly processes as a way to make threedimensional structures. However, limitations of both passive and activeLBL selfassembly processes provide considerable incentive tocontinue the development of better paradigms for this type ofnanofabrication. Over the past decade, electronic microarray deviceshave been used to carry out the parallel addressing and selectivebinding of charged biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, biotinstreptavidin,and antibodies as well as quantum dots, metallic and polymericnanoparticles, cells and even micron sized semiconductor devices.More recently, we have developed an electronic microarray process forthe rapid and highly parallel assisted selfassembly of protein and DNAderivatized nanoparticles into multilayer structures. This process allows3D structures with as many as forty alternating nanoparticle layers to becompleted in less than one hour. Electric field assisted selfassemblyrepresents an example of combining some of the best aspects of topdown and bottomup technologies into viable process for thehierarchical assembly and integration of nanocomponents into 3Dstructures. Such a process will be useful for a variety of nanoelectronic,nanophotonic, energy conversion fuel cells, photovoltaics, andbatteries, nanocomposite material and therapeuticdrug delivery andbiosensorbioagent detection applications.654039, Session 7Portable fieldcapable decontamination system forchemical, biological, and radiological agents SPEEDSN.

T. Wong, Univ. of CaliforniaLos AngelesThe ability to monitor health status, disease onset and progression, andtreatment outcome through noninvasive means is a most desirablegoal in health care promotion and delivery. There are two prerequisitesto materialize this goal specific biomarkers associated with a health ordisease state and the technologies to discriminate the biomarkers.Being able to engage these prerequisites on a noninvasive biofluid likesaliva will be very helpful. A recent initiative catalyzed by the NationalInstitute of Dental  Craniofacial Research NIDCR has created aroadmap to achieve these goals through the use of oral fluids as thediagnostic medium to scrutinize the health andor disease status ofindividuals. This is an ideal opportunity to bridge state of the art salivabased biosensors, optimized to disease discriminatory salivarybiomarkers, for diagnostic applications. Oral fluid saliva is a perfectmedium to be explored for health and disease surveillance.

L. Stewart, J. G. Pounds, A. L. Miracle, J. R. Campbell, PacificNorthwest National Lab.Researchers are taking an integrated approach that uses new analytical,imaging, and computational tools to identify biosignatures of responseto environmental stressors. Biosignatures are reproducible patterns ofcomplex highdimensional data, including expressed genes, proteins,metabolites, and lipids that describe a biological system stressed by theenvironment andor disease. Bioinformatics and novel statisticalapproaches are critical to identify the information containing features, orbiomarkers, from the biosignature. These biomarkers can be used asearly, predictive indicators of an environmental stress or disease. Thechallenges to efficient discovery and implementation of biomarkersinclude 1 quantitatively identifying and defining the presence ofenvironmental stressors and disease using emerging, multimodal andnoninvasive imaging modalities, 2 using efficient and integratedexperimental design and methods to capture the appropriatebiosignatures, 3 integrating heterogeneous data sets, 4 identifyingpatterns and confounding variables across datasets and experiments,5 identifying biomarkers within the biosignature, and 6 developing anddeploying sensor platforms on site or in clinic for rapid, sensitive, andeconomic measurement of biomarkers. The promise is the ability topredict events and threats early enough, i.e., presymptomatically, totake preventive action that reduces human suffering and economicimpact.

B. James, A. E. Bolotnikov, G. S. Camarda, G. A. Carini, Y. Cui,Brookhaven National Lab.Cadmium zinc telluride CZT is one of the most promising materials forthe production of largevolume gammaray spectrometers and imagingarrays operable at room temperature.  The performance of CZT devices,the global capacity for growth of detectorgrade crystals, and the sizeof the commercial market have progressed steadily over the past 510years.  Because of deficiencies in the quality of the material,commercial highresolution CZT spectrometers are still limited torelatively small dimensions  23 cm3, which makes them inefficient atdetecting high photon energies  1 MeV and somewhat ineffective forweak radiation signals except in proximity to the source.   The detectorsare very attractive for a much broader range of spectroscopic andimaging applications however, increases in their efficiency are neededwithout sacrificing the ability to spectrally resolve gamma energies.Achieving the goal of lowcost efficient CZT detectors requires progressin the following areas better uniformity of detector response, growth oflarge uniform single crystals, and improved device fabricationConf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 33procedures.

Flammang, Westinghouse Electric Co.The development of methods for detection of concealed Special NuclearMaterial SNM is an important goal in order to prevent a terrorist nucleardetonation within the United States. SNM is the key constituent ofnuclear weapons and improvised nuclear devices.A new, nonintrusive neutron interrogation technique for detection ofconcealed SNM is being developed.  This technique is a combination oftiming techniques from pulsed prompt gamma neutron activation analysiswith silicon carbide SiC semiconductor fast neutron detectortechnology.  SiC detectors are a new class of radiation detectors that areultrafast and capable of processing high count rates.  SiC neutrondetectors can operate during and immediately following intense neutronor gammaray bursts, providing the ability to detect the prompt neutronemissions from fission events produced in concealed SNM by the burstson a much faster time scale than has been achieved by other techniques.Neutroninduced fission neutrons in 235U have been observed in thetime intervals during and between pulses of 14MeV neutrons from adeuteriumtritium electronic neutron generator.  Source neutron pulsingand timesequenced fissionneutron counts were carried out on ahundreds of microseconds time scale, enabling the observation ofprompt fission neutrons induced by the dieaway of thermal neutronsfollowing the 14MeV pulse.  Initial measurements, emphasizing thedetection of SNM using thermalneutron induced fission were reported atthis meeting last year.

Tantum, Duke Univ. C. Shyu, D. T. Holslin, Science ApplicationsInternational Corp. L. M. Collins, Duke Univ.Pulsed fastthermal neutron analysis FPTNA has been developed fornonintrusive and nondestructive examination of closed containers toclassify andor identify the material within. This technique utilizes pulsedneutrons to induce gamma ray emissions from the interrogated target.The emitted gamma ray energies are characteristic of the nuclei withwhich the neutrons interacted. Thus, classification andor identificationof the material within the closed container can be achieved via PFTNA.Therefore PFTNA is a viable technology for classification andidentification of UXO fill materials. The conventional approach toanalyzing the gamma ray spectra is to estimate the elementalcomposition by utilizing measured elemental spectral responses andapplying a least squares estimation technique. In this work, alternativeapproaches to analyzing the gamma ray energy spectra for UXO fillmaterial classification and identification are presented. The alternatespectral analysis techniques include principal components analysisPCA and a variant of the multiple signal classification MUSICalgorithm. These spectral analysis techniques produce features whichare then utilized within a Bayesian framework for fill materialclassification and identification. Classification and identification resultsobtained using both simulated gamma ray spectra and gamma rayspectra data measured with the PELAN system are presented. Theresults indicate that the proposed signal processing approaches providebetter performance than conventional elemental composition estimationby least squares analysis.This work is supported by ESTCP.654052, Session 8Active millimeter wave detection of concealed layers ofdielectric materialN.

United KingdomExtensive work has been published on millimetre wave active andpassive detection and imaging of metallic objects concealed underclothing.  We propose and demonstrate a technique for revealing thedepth as well as the outline of partially transparent objects, which isespecially suited to imaging layer materials such as explosives anddrugs.The technique uses a focussed and scanned FMCW source, sweptthrough many GHz to reveal this structure. The principle involved is thata parallel sided dielectric slab produces reflections at both its upper andlower surfaces, acting as a FabryPerot interferometer.  This produces apattern of alternating reflected peaks and troughs in frequency space.Conf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III34 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssFourier or Burg transforming this pattern into zspace generates a peakat the thickness of the irradiated sample.It could be argued that though such a technique may work for singleuniform slabs of dielectric material, it will give results of little or nosignificance when the sample both scatters the incident radiation andgives erratic reflectivities due to its nonuniform thickness andpermittivity . We show results for a variety of materials such asexplosive simulants, powder and liquid, both alone and concealedunder clothing or in a rucksack, which display strongly directionalreflectivities at millimeter wavelengths, and whose location is welldisplayed by a varying thickness parameter as the millimetre beam isscanned across the target.With this system we find that samples can easily be detected atstandoff distances of at least 4.6m.654053, Session 8Nonscanning xray backscattering inspection systemsbased on xray focusingM. Gertsenshteyn, V. Grubsky, G. D. Savant, T. P. Jannson, PhysicalOptics Corp.Noninvasive realtime bulk detection and identification of highexplosives and improvised explosives, illicit materials hidden insuitcases, vehicles, containers or behind metal and nonmetal walls areof critical importance for safety and security worldwide. Existingtechniques for noninvasive detection such as microwaves, acoustic,thermal and terahertz and mmwave imaging systems penetrate onlyselected materials. Scanning Xray pencil beam backscatter imagingsystems can penetrate many materials, but they are bulky, andineffective at standoff distances and on moving targets. This paperdiscusses a nonscanning, portable, realtime detection Xraybackscattering system based on novel lobster eye Xray focusingoptics. The system focuses backscatter photons from an obscuredobject several meters away that is being irradiated by short highpowerXray pulses. The ability of lobstereye lenses to focus Xrays allowssuch an imaging system to collect more photons into a smaller spotthan traditional scanning or pinhole systems. This results in a highersignaltonoise ratio and better spatial resolution. The gated Xraycamera will support highresolution backscatter imaging analysisenabling obscured target recognition. Realtime image acquisitionprocessing hardware and software will collect Xray backscatter targetimagery produced by lobstereye optics from each Xray pulse. Theimages can be further enhanced by software processing, which allowsreconstruction of the object with high accuracy for detection with highprobability and a low false alarm rate.654054, Session 8Bimodal detection of underground detection in twodimensional systemsM. F. SerranoGuzman, I. Y. Padilla, R. Rodriguez, Univ. de PuertoRico Mayagez C. M. Rappaport, Northeastern Univ.An environmental issue that has reached interest in the academic andindustry is groundwater contamination. Moreover, government agenciesare concerned, for example, about the widespread of dense nonaqueous phase liquids DNAPLs in the underground due to incorrectdisposal of this substance. Over the last five years we have done agreat effort to enhance Cross Well Radar as a technology for detectionof compounds which can be used to predict the mobility andpersistence of chemicals in the unsaturated near surface.  Imageacquisition and processing has also been applied for contaminantdetection and monitoring.In this paper, we describe a twodimensional multiphase flowexperiment that was designed to develop and evaluate two modes ofconcurrent detection and monitoring technologies Cross Well RadarCWR and Image Analysis IA. DNAPL transport experiments areconducted in unsaturated soil under transient conditions.

Reijonen, N. Andresen, F. M. Gicquel, R. A. Gough, T. V. Kalvas,M. J. King, T. P. Lou, J. H. Vainionpaa, S. B. Wilde, LawrenceBerkeley National Lab.There is a growing urgency in developing suitable neutron andorphotonsources for homeland security applications. The Plasma and IonSource Technology Group has been active in developing high yield DD,DT and TT fusion reaction based neutron generators but also indeveloping nuclear reaction based high energy gamma generators. Onecommon feature in these various devices is the use of high efficiencyRFinduction discharge ion source. This discharge method provideshigh plasma density for high output current, high atomic species frommolecular gases for high efficiency neutron or gamma generation andlong  lifetime. Predictable discharge characteristics of these plasmagenerators allow accurate modeling for both the beam dynamics andfor the heat loads at the target spot. During the past few years, thePlasma  and Ion Source Technology Group has developed, fabricatedand delivered various neutron generator systems for multiple U.S. andforeign entities. Current status of the current neutron and gammagenerator development with experimental data will be discussed in thispresentation.654057, Session 8Remote explosive and chemical agent detection usingbroadly tunable mininfrared external cavity quantumcascade lasersT. Day, M. J. Weida, M. B. Pushkarsky, T. J. Rayner, DaylightSolutionsCivilian soft targets such as transportation systems are being targetedby terrorists both with IEDs and suicide bombers. Although explosivedetection technologies exist and are used effectively in aviation, thesetechnologies do not lend themselves well to protecting openarchitecture soft targets, as they are focused on a checkpoint formfactor which limits throughput. However a remote detection capabilityof explosives and other chemicals would enable these kinds of targetsto be protected without interrupting the flow of commerce.Tunable Mid IR Laser technology offers the opportunity to detectexplosives and other chemicals remotely and quickly.  Most chemicalcompounds, including explosives have their fundamental vibrationalmodes in the midinfrared 3 to 15m. There are a variety of techniquesthat focus on examining interactions that have proven effective in thelaboratory but could never work in the field due to complexity, size,reliability and cost. Daylight Solutions has solved these problems byintegrating quantum cascade gain media into external tunable cavitiesthat has resulted in miniaturized, broadly tunable midIR laser sources.The laser sources have a capability to tune to  5 of their centerwavelength which means they can sweep through an entire absorptionspectrum to ensure very good detection and false alarm performancecompared with fixed wavelength devices. These devices are also highlyportable, operate at room temperature, generate 10s to 100s of mW inoptical power in pulsed and continuous wave configurations. DaylightSolutions is in the process of developing a variety of standoff explosiveand chemical weapon detection systems using this technology.Conf. 6540 Optics and Photonics in Global Homeland Security III spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 35Conf. 6541 Thermosense XXIXGrand 8B, MondayThursday 912 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6541 Thermosense XXIX654102, Session 1A custom LWIR microscope for highspeed temperaturemeasurementsJ. I. Barletta, J. O. M. Karlsson, Z. M. Zhang, Georgia Institute ofTechnologyA custom infrared microscope was designed to measure the temporaland spatial temperature distribution of a thin, 50micron wide stainlesssteel filament that heats at 1 million Cs. Using a MCT detector sensitivein the 9 to 10 micron wavelengths and two aspheric lens the microscopeachieved a 7x magnification with a dynamic range of approximately 0 to800 C blackbody. Video images at 96 x 96 pixels of the heating eventwere acquired at rates of approximately 2800 fps. However, a variety ofoptical and technical challenges made conversion from detector countsto temperature difficult. Calibration of the camera at these speedsrequired attention to the rapid intensity change of the steel, so a specialsetup was developed to calibrate the systems radiosity measurements.Additionally, diffraction at this magnification and these wavelengthssignificantly reduced the spatial resolution. An additional postprocessingdeconvolution step was implemented using an optical transfer functiondetermined through experimentation with bar targets. Furthermore, theemissivity of the stainless steel was found to be specular andtemperature dependent while also being greatly effected by surfaceoxidation. A variety of experiments were required to determine a suitableemissivity correction. Although originally an elusive task, accuratetemperature measurements using these methods were obtained whichcorrelated well with computer simulations of the temperature distribution.654104, Session 1The effects of surface reflection and surroundingenvironment on target temperature estimation using aninfrared FPAM. Voigt, Siemens Corporate Research D. H. LeMieux, V.Jonnalagadda, Siemens Power GenerationTo improve the accuracy of temperature estimation for enclosed objectswith reflective surface properties, the surface emissivity, reflectance,geometry and incident radiation from the surrounding environment canbe considered. This paper describes a basic model of the incidentradiation on a FPA sensor element considering a target object,surrounding environment, surface temperatures, surface emissivityreflection and optics. The model is used to characterize the direct onecolor method temperature estimation error as a function of the reflectionand the geometry of the environment in near infrared. Two approaches toimprove the temperature estimation accuracy are discussed. The firstapproach focuses on the estimation of maximum temperatures in thescene. The second approach is based on the idea to recover the thermalemitted surface radiation from the mixture of measure reflected andthermal emitted radiation.654105, Session 2Application of visible image mixing function forthermographyA. Ichikawa, Nippon Avionics Co., Ltd. JapanBy combining visible image with thermal image, Image mixing functionallows you to pinpoint location of hot spot or cold spot on the object.Mixing image data are gathered from wide variety of application includingRD, PPM and process monitoring.654106, Session 2Benefits of IRvisible fusionR. N. Schmidt, Fluke ThermographyFor years thermogaphers have wanted images with fine infrared detailand a wide field of view FOV.  Fusion of a wide FOV visible image witha smaller FOV infrared image provides just that at a nominal cost.  Themajor benefit of this technology is that the camera operator can identifythe exact location and temperature of infrared pointsofinterest in avisible picture.  Thermographers can see infrared problem areas onwide FOV visible image. Maintenance technicians now have a directcouple between visible pictures and infrared identified problem areas.Building inspectors for example can use this to advantage innegotiations and legal arbitration and litigation needs.  Commercialcameras with IRvisible fusion technology have been available for abouta year.  This paper will present real case applications for a number ofdifferent uses.654107, Session 2Highspeed shortwave infrared SWIR imagingD. S. Malchow, Goodrich Corp. M. H. Ettenberg, Sensors Unlimited,Inc. J. Battaglia, Goodrich Corp.Imaging in the Short Wave Infrared SWIR provides unique surveillancecapabilities, both with passive illumination from the night glow in theatmosphere or with active illumination from covert LED or eyesafelasers.  Spectral effects specific to the 0.9 to 1.7 um wavelength rangereveal camouflage and chemical signatures of ordinance.   Increasedmilitary interest in cameras that image all laser range finders and targetdesignators on the battlefield has driven development of a new class ofuncooled InGaAs cameras with higher resolution and larger field of viewthan previously available.  Current and upcoming needs include range gating the camera to image through obscurants or beyondunimportant objects and high speed capture of muzzle flare,  projectile tracking, guide star andcommunications laserbeam tracking and wavefront correction.This paper will present images from new COTS cameras now available,showing high speed images and spectra of small arms weapons andrifles.654108, Session 2Retrieval of air quality information using imageprocessing techniqueH. S. Lim, M. Z. Mat Jafri, K. Abdullah, Univ. Sains MalaysiaMalaysiaThis paper presents and describes an approach to retrieveconcentration of particulate matter of size less than 10 micron PM10from Landsat TM data over Penang Island. The objective of this study istest the feasibility of using Landsat TM for PM10 mapping using ourproposed developed algorithm. The development of the algorithm wasdeveloped base on the aerosol characteristics in the atmosphere. Thisstudy is unique because the algorithm used a combination ofreflectance measurement from the visible bands and the correspondingapparent temperature values of the thermal band. PM10 measurementswere collected using a DustTrak Aerosol Monitor 8520 simultaneouslywith the image acquisition. The station locations of the PM10measurements were detemined using a hand held GPS. The digitalnumbers were extracted corresponding to the groundtruth locations foreach band and then converted into radiance and reflectance values.The reflectance measured from the satellite reflectance at the top ofatmospheric,   TOA was subtracted by the amount given by thesurface reflectance to obtain the atmospheric reflectance. Then theatmospheric reflectance was related to the PM10 using regressionanalysis. The surface reflectance values were created using ACTOR2image correction software in the PCI Geomatica 9.1.8 image processingsoftware. The proposed developed algorithm produced high accuracyand also showed a good agreement R 0.8406 between the measuredand estimated PM10. This study indicates that it is feasible to useLandsat TM data for mapping PM10 using the proposed algorithm.36 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654109, Session 3The importance of spatial resolution in IR thermographytemperature measurement three brief case studiesR. P. Madding, G. L. Orlove, B. R. Lyon, Infrared Training Ctr.This paper discusses the differences in temperature measurementamong three infrared IR cameras with different spatial resolutions.  Thetargets used were actual field problems.  This was not a laboratoryexperiment, but a realworld test of these cameras.  Images were takenunder the same conditions at the same distance with all the IR cameras.The results show there can be dramatic differences in temperaturereadings illustrating the importance of adequate resolution whenmaking temperature measurements with IR cameras.654110, Session 3How water behaves thermallyJ. R. Snell, R. W. Spring, Snell InfraredWater is a remarkable substance in many regards, not the least of whichis the fact that it often easily exists in all three phases, gas, liquid andsolid, at terrestrial temperatures. It also readily evaporates, has thehighest thermal capacitance of any common material, and is quiteconductive to heat in liquid and solid phases. In its gas phase it is alsohighly absorbing of infrared radiation.For all these reasons, and more, thermographers must have a fullunderstanding of how water behaves thermally. This presentation willdiscuss the relevant fundamentals and behaviors including conduction,capacitance and evaporation and the interaction among severalbehaviors at one time. The presentation will be illustrated with thermalimages and the discussions grounded in the practice of thermography,especially for building scientists.654111, Session 4Application of thermographic imaging in exotic animalmedicineM.

Cuber, D.Babecki, P. Wiszniowski, EMAG PolandDue to exceptionally hard environmental conditions and complexity ofapplied equipment, an extraordinary set of threats and events can occurin every underground coal mine. Some of these threats are beyondabsolute control of man and machine. In such conditions, maximizingopportunities of preventing injury or death to miners or to rescue andrecovery personnel, plays a particularly important role. We intend topresent the results of IR thermographic camera applications for variouscategories of tasks person relocation, rescue or fire fighting as well assearching for thermal signatures of defects and natural hazards. Thistype of thermal imaging and thermography implementation may be veryeffective, although presages difficult, sometimes extremely hardconditions of IR surveys  both for camera and its operator.654115, Session 5Investigations of proton beam entry window cooling ofliquid metal target of spallation neutron source usinginfrared thermographyJ. A. Patorski, F. Groeschel, Paul Scherrer Institute SwitzerlandDuring the integration test MIT of the MEGAPIE neutron spallationsource target the infrared thermography IRT has been used toinvestigate the liquid metal LM leadbismuth eutectic LBE alloycooling of the proton beam entry window of the target. Investigationshave been performed few months before of proton irradiation started inAugust 2006 at PSI SINQ facility for more details see web page httpmegapie.web.psi.ch . Goals of thermohydraulics investigations of theliquid LBE flow in flow cooling the ca. 1.25 ms speedy bypass jetflow into the slower ca. 0.33 ms main flow of the steel window, havebifocal perspective. On one hand the goal was visualization for anobservation of time and geometrical changes of the cooling field patternof the bypass jet flow, i.e. the qualitative behavior of the cooling interms of the sufficient covering of the proton beam irradiation footprint area. On second hand the goal was determination  of localconvection heat transfer coefficient HTC on the steel wall of the protonbeam entry window area of the MEGAPIE target, i.e. the quantitativedistribution of cooling.For the qualitative visualization of the real target window cooling wehave take advantage of slightly higher temperature of the LBE bypassjet flow streaming ca. 3C and we have performed so called MITWarmJet experiment series. For the quantitative determination of HTCinstead of the real target window we have used specimen sensor dishand performed so called MITKILOPIE experiment series using thetwo dimensional and dynamic infrared thermography 2DDIRT method1.The results of measurements are presented in form of IRT thermogramsor thermogram sequences which are extracted from the rawtemperature field measurements.References1 J.A.Patorski  F.Groeschel, Experimental determination of localconvection heat transfer coefficient field using twodimensional anddynamic infrared thermography 2DDIRT method, ThermosenseXXVIII, Jonathan J.

S. Lim, M. Z. Mat Jafri, K. Abdullah, Univ. Sains MalaysiaMalaysiaAn algorithm has been developed using Landsat TM thermal channel forthe retrieval of land surface temperature LST over Saudi Arabia. Theobjective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of LandsatTM 5 imageries in mapping Land Surface Temperature. The data usedwas captured by Thematic Mapper TM sensor onboard the Landsat 5satellite. Landsat TM has only one thermal band, and therefore the spiltwindow algorithm cannot be used for the retrieval of LST. We usedmono window technique in this study. The proposed LST algorithmincluded three parameters, brightness temperature, surface emissivityand incoming solar radiation in the algorithm regression analysis. Thecorrelation between the LST and the brightness temperature hadincreased significantly after the surface emissivity and solar zenith anglewere included in the algorithm. The reference values LST weredetermined using ATCOR2T in the PCI Geomatica image 9.1processing software for algorithm calibration. The results indicate thatLST values retrieved from remotely sensed data were stronglydependent on the surface emissivity and solar zenith angle.654117, Session 6Automated applications of the infrared imagers in theautomotive assembly lines products and process controlM. A. Omar, Clemson Univ. O. Suzuki, Hitachi, Ltd. Japan J. Liu,Toyota Motor Manufacturing KentuckyThis work discusses the automated application of the microbolometricand the photonic cooled infrared arrays, in the context of theautomotive assembly operations.

Cobo, J. M. Mirapeix, O. M. Conde, P. B. GarciaAllende, F. J.Madruga, J. M. LpezHiguera, Univ. de Cantabria SpainThe possibility of reducing defects in the arc welding process hasattracted research interest, particularly, in the aerospace and nuclearsectors where the resulting weld quality is a major concern and must beassured by costly, timeconsuming, nondestructive testing NDTprocedures. One possible approach is the analysis of a measurandcorrelated with the formation of defects, from which a control action,like changing the welding speed, is derived. Among others, thethermographic analysis of the weld pool and the heataffected zone hasproven to be a useful technique, since the temperature profile of thematerial being welded has a clear correlation with the processparameters.In this paper, we propose a control system for the submergedarcwelding SAW process, based on thermographic analysis from the backface of the joint. It is intended for defect reduction in the welding ofshell sections of nuclear steam generators, for which top faceinspection is not possible, while visual inspection by an operator fromthe back face inside the generator has safety concerns.From the thermal image, the proposed system identifies the weld pooland its temperature profile, from which the condition of full penetrationwithout perforation is checked. Preliminary results using a ThermaCAMSC2000 are discussed in the paper. Additionally, a study of thefeasibility of using a colorimetric approach with a conventional CCDcolor camera for temperature estimation is presented. It is possiblesince the temperature of the weld pool is around 900 C, with significantlight emission in the visible spectrum. As an additional advantage of thisalternative, a critical defect to be corrected, perforation, is easilydetected as plasma emission from the arc.654119, Session 6Survey of thermal profiling in electronics qualitycharacterizationS. Hsieh, Texas AM Univ.This paper surveys the current state of thermal profiling for electronicfaults, defects detection and reliability investigation.  Issues essential tothe successful application of infrared techniques to electronicsmanufacturing and circuit card maintenance are investigated.  Theseissues include basic knowhow such as scanning time intervals andscreening variables a description of the types of defects and faultsthese methods have been used to detect and a comparison of infraredthermal imaging and other detection means, such as Xray andfunctional testers.  The work concludes with a summary of potentialproblems and remedies.  Future directions include design for infrareddiagnosis, development of integrated testing techniques for detectionand rootcause analysis, and thermal profile library development.654120, Session 6Application of online infrared thermography in steelmaking industryM. Viale, O. A. Martin, Ternium ArgentinaThis work is about three real applications in the steel industry where theinfrared technology is used online, to control the process and toincrease safety.All the applications where developed by the automation group ofTerniumSiderar. The main objectives to use the infrared thermographyin steel plant are to reduce production costs and to prevent mayordamages.The first work is about automatic slag detection during the tappingoperation of the BOF converters by thermographical image processing.The benefit is to reduce fluxes due to less slag passing and also toeliminate the ladle recirculation for excessive slag. Additionally, the steelshop process engineers are using the camera information to estimatesome other process variables. There is a project to make all the BOFtapping fully automatic, using the camera information.The second work is about online ladle hot spot detection. A failure ofthe ladle refractory bricks may cause damages in the ladle car,mechanical equipment, and cabling in the ladle furnace. To detect thesefailures, a system of four infrared cameras with an image processingsoftware was developed. Also in future applications, the thermalinformation is going to be used for data correlation with other processvariables.The third one is in the sinter plant, where the camera temperatureinformation is used to optimize the process control. Before the systeminstallation, there was not available information about the sinter materialtemperature. Nowadays there is an online information that is used toclose the control loop.654121, Session 6Process control monitoring of gasification units inpetrochemical and power plantsG. E. Strahan, Infrared Cameras, Inc.This paper describes the applications of wireless radiometric imagingtechnology to the monitoring and control of various process points ingasification units in petrochemical production facilities and in powerplants.Thermal images are displayed in a spectrum of colors from dark blue forthe coolest temperatures to redorangeyellow for the hottest. Thecolors are keyed to a temperature graph covering the range oftemperatures encountered in the particular system. The operator cancrossreference a color to a temperature graph located alongside animage on the same screen.Several other past and future petrochemical applications will also bediscussed.654123, Session 6Images processing and flow measurement applied to thethermographic analysis of heatlosses in boilersisolationM. A. Hurtado, H. Bentez, H. Loaiza, Univ. del Valle Colombia J.Millan, Anter Ltda Colombia J. A. Gonzalez, Univ. del ValleColombia C. IbarraCastanedo, Univ. Laval CanadaInfrared thermography is a noncontact evaluation technique whichallows not only the registration of the temperature distribution on asurface, but also the calculation of the amount of heat flowing throughit. Boilers are important for industry and the quantification of the heatlosses is beneficial to avoid fuel waste.The present work suggests a methodology to calculate the thermic flowthrough boilers isolation surfaces, using thermic images. With this, it ispossible to find the flow by using a thermogram taking intoconsideration the thermograms range, knowing the cameras FOV,Conf. 6541 Thermosense XXIX38 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsssurfaces emmisivity and characteristic length, objecttocameradistance, environmental temperature, and the assigned greylevelcalibration curve to determined temperature range.A software tool to upload and process the information was developed.This tool can calculate the surfaces average convection coefficient hcby using empiric correlations developed for common geometries andheat transfer equations to calculate the thermic flow.To test the technique functioning, the information given by the softwaretool was compared to the data given by the heat flow measurementthermal sensor. This comparison showed a 3 error range of relativeerror.  The final validation was made on a waterwallboilers homeisolated walls and the highest error obtained was close to 15.Regardless the calibration curve was found under laboratory conditionsand the empiric correlations to calculate hc are for isometric surfaces,the methodology presented a good performance. This then is a firststep to quantify the global heat losses on boilers isolation surfaces.654124, Session 7Building thermography surveys for moisture detectionand assessmentN. P. Avdelidis, EBETAM S.A. GreeceUsually, building moisture surveys are performed using moisturedetecting equipment other than infrared imaging. These include nondestructive and penetrating moisture meters. Both types of thesemoisture meters require direct contact with the building materialsurface, as well as considerable amount of time necessary to scan allsurfaces of the building being surveyed. Because contact is required,hard to reach locations limit the effective use of moisture meterinstruments. In contrast, an infrared camera detects moisture byimaging the different temperatures of wet versus dry building materials.On the other hand, building assessments for water detection canroutinely be performed using an infrared  thermal imaging system i.e. itcan locate probable wet conditions of building material surfaces. In thiswork, infrared camera surveys were performed at various locations inbuildings to evaluate moisture in building materials and surfaces. Therapid IR camera surveys allowed for hard to reach area evaluation,quick survey of the buildings, as well as provided images for the surveyreport. Results indicate that thermography allows for nondestructivedetection of water entry, quick survey of an area, automatic visualdocumentation and images that can reveal potential threats to thebuilding.654125, Session 7A nondestructive method for diagnostic of insulatedbuilding walls using infrared thermographyM. Larbi Youcef, A. Mazioud, Univ. Paris 12 ValdeMarne FranceP. Bremond, Cedip Infrared Systems France L. Ibos, Y. Candau,Univ. Paris 12 ValdeMarne France M. Piro, EDF FranceThis work deals with the development of an experimental protocol forthe diagnostic of multilayered insulated building walls. This study is apart of a project which aims at supplying a control method forconformity of the heat insulation of buildings after restoration, whichrepresents 60  of the flats park in France.First, a test bench is set up in order to measure front and back sidestemperatures of  standard panels. Theses panels are compounded of1cm of plaster and various thicknesses of polystyrene. The panelsconsidered in this study have thicknesses of respectively 2, 6 and10cm. The front side is heated by two halogen lamps of 500 W. Thetemperature measurements during an exposure time te of heating andsubsequent cooling are carried out with thermocouples and a longwave infrared camera CEDIP Jade LWIR with Altair Software.In a second time, a onedimensional model based on thermalquadruples and Laplace transforms was developed under Matlabenvironment. The model simulates a twolayered wall heated with aconstant power P on its front side and using constant global convectiveheat transfer coefficients on front and back sides. Also, we developed athree dimensional model based on finite volumes using Fluentcomputational code.Finally, a method of identification of physical parameters is developedby performing a leastsquare minimization based on LevenbergMarquardt method. The experimental measurements are compared totheoretical results and by minimization we obtain the thermalconductivity and diffusivity as well as the thickness of the two layers.654126, Session 7Integration of optical, active, and passive IRT proceduresfor characterization of restoration mortars surfaceN. Ludwig, Univ. degli Studi di Milano Italy E. Rosina, Politecnicodi Milano ItalyTexture of the material affects the distribution of surface temperature,especially at transient condition. Moreover, the roughness of surfacehas some influence on both water and radiation absorbance of thesurface. The research starts from the observation in the field of thedegradation behaviour of different texture of mortars with high RH rateand low ambient temperature textures obtained with hard tools e.g.spatula, trowel have harder surfaces, more compacted, which facilitatethe condensation of water vapour on the contrary, use soft toolssponge, sponge float causes rough surface of the finishing, whichfacilitate the absorption and evaporation of moisture. In case ofcontiguity between two different finishing, the edges of rougher surfacearound more compact texture show major damage.Early detection of these risk areas, by use of IRT, is a great deal forpreservation of historical buildings without a controlled heating,ventilation and air conditioning system, and an advancement for therestoration techniques of precious surfaces. For that, authors studiedthe surfaces properties of responding to thermal stimulation andhumidity exchange between surfaces and ambient, by means ofthermographic technique both in active and passive approach.Measurements of the reflectance in the visibleNIR spectral band 4001100 nm and emissivity in the thermal IR 814 micron allowed to verifydifferences in thermal effusivity of the external layers of the sampleswith different finishing. As a conclusion, the comparison betweenthermal behaviour and localization of mortar grains allows to evaluatehow much the finishing techniques affect the thermal characteristics.654127, Session 7Trestles anyone a thermographic nightmareJ. L. Grossman, HiTech Inspection Services, Inc.Railroads are close to capacity and there is only so much that can besqueezed through a pipe. The result is insufficient equipment, longertrains, tighter schedules and of course the stretching of personnel.Now, imagine that as one of these freight trains, comprising amongother things, chemical tankers and boxcars containing a variety ofdifferent materials including hazardous materials while crossing a riverhas the trestle collapse underneath it. Hundreds of thousands ofpounds of steel, wood and of course the hazardous chemicals fall intothe river, pollute the land and the river and shut down a port.FarfetchedThis paper will reveal the results of a unique thermographic inspection,the findings, the results and the protocols.654128, Session 7Requesting and specifying thermographic inspectionservices through National Master Specification NMSCanadaA. Colantonio, M. Theauvette, Public Works and GovernmentServices Canada CanadaNational Master Specification NMS is the generic specification formatused extensively in the Canadian construction industry for thedevelopment of specifications used in bid documents for new andretrofitted commercial building projects.  The NMS group, thoughconsultations with the building industry and departmental experts inPublic Works and Government Services Canada have developed foursections for commonly implemented infrared thermographic servicesConf. 6541 Thermosense XXIX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 39associated with building construction and maintenance.  These includeinspection services for building envelopes, roofs, mechanicalequipment, and electrical equipment.  This paper will introduce thesesections and discuss the relevant information in each section that ispertinent to each type of inspection service.  The paper will highlight theimportant differences of each type of inspection that precipitated theneed for individual sections for each type of infrared thermographicinspection service.  These sections have been developed to include allaspects of such services and are all encompassing in their scope.  Theusers of the NMS generic format are free to use and modify any part ofthese sections that are relevant to their building project.  Buildingowners and property managers can also employ the specificationformat to call up services for building condition studies.  Although thesections have been developed for use in the commercial buildingindustry, the residential construction industry can modify any section fortheir use.  This paper will discuss these differences, and providesuggestions for the development of such a residential specificationformat.654129, Session 7Building thermography as a tool in energy audits andbuilding commissioning procedureT. T. Kauppinen, VTT FinlandA Building Commissioningproject ToVa was launched in Finland in theyear 2003. A comprehensive commissioning procedure, including thebuilding process and operation stage was developed in the project.Similar to Cxprocedures used in the USA, this procedure will confirmthe precise documentation of clients goals, definition of planning goalsand the performance of the building. The method has been tested inpilot buildings and the aim is to develop it further in practicalconstruction projects.It is rather usual, that within 12 years after introduction the userscomplain about the defects or performance malfunctions of thebuilding. Often the reasons are related to problems in building envelope,in building services, in HVACsystem, in automation system and, ascombined effect, failures in indoor climate.The performance has been tried to confirm by various quality controlmethods during design, construction and mobilization stages. Thecompleted building, however, has not been as such as the client hasordered or wanted.Thermography is one important manual tool in verifying the thermalperformance of the building envelope. In this paper the results of onepilot building a school will be presented.In surveying the condition and energy efficiency of buildings, variousauxiliary means are needed. We can compare the consumption data ofthe target building with other, same type of buildings by benchmarking.Energy audit helps to localize and determine the energy savingpotential.The most general and also most effective auxiliary means in monitoringthe thermal performance of building envelopes is an infrared camera. Inthis presentation some examples of the use of thermography in energyaudits are presented.654130, Session 8Heattransfer mechanisms in fiberreinforced polymercomposites bonded to concreteJ. R. Brown, R. L. Baker, L. Kallemeyn, Hope CollegeThis research project investigated heat transfer mechanisms that occurduring radiant heating of glassepoxy composites bonded to concrete.The ultimate goal is to develop a field procedure for estimating thethickness of fiberreinforced polymer FRP composites used tostrengthen existing reinforced concrete structures.  Thickness is animportant parameter in the design and implementation ofnondestructive testing procedures that evaluate bond in FRP systems.Four concrete samples 15 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm were constructed withglassepoxy composite bonded to the surface.  The thickness of thecomposite varied from 1mm to 4mm and thermocouples were placed at1mm intervals throughout the composite.  Experimental data wascompared with a simple theoretical model that predicts the surfacetemperature response of a layered system subjected to a uniform heatflux.  Two factors were shown to significantly influence the heat transfermechanism surface absorptivity of the FRP composite and convectivecooling.  Additional analytical modeling using the finite element methodwas performed to account for these affects in an effort to obtain abetter estimate of FRP thickness based on experimental data.654131, Session 8Control of CFRP strengthening applied to civil structuresby IR thermographyR. Trentin, E. G. Grinzato, P. G. Bison, S. Marinetti, ConsiglioNazionale delle Ricerche ItalyAn increasing demand of checking the effectiveness of strengtheningand repair intervention on structural components, both in buildings andbridges, promotes NdT methods. In particular when innovative materialsas CFRP Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer are used, IR thermographyexhibits excellent performances. Non destructive control by the use ofthermographic analysis is used to detect adhesion defects orimperfections, which can lead the component to brittle and unexpectedcollapse. This paper shows as the geometrical evaluation ofdelaminated areas is carried out. Laboratory tests both on reduced orfull scale are performed to set up and validate the proposed procedure.An experimental study on samples bonded with FRP and containingdefects appropriately applied at the interface, will be presented. Aseries of beams 10 m long have been tested under bending loads andstrengthened conditions, by placing a preimpregnated thin carbonCFRP laminate at the intrados. Different reinforcement configurationshave been adopted in the beams ordinary steel reinforcement and withaddition of prestressed strands, using mechanical devices for theanchorage of the supplementary pretension of the strips. At local level,the simulation of possible lack of bonding during loading or intrinsicdefects and imperfections has been contextually analysed onspecifically dimensioned samples.Different algorithms have been applied at the evaluation stage in orderto estimate the defect size and location. Particularly, the extension ofthe delamination is estimate with a simple and robust algorithm. Infacts, the standards set the limit for acceptable defects, both in termsof number and size.The most significant results of the experimental tests and themathematical simulation obtained through the application ofthermographic inspection on preliminary samples and fullscale beamsare discussed in the paper.654133, Session 9IR thermographic inspection of filament wound CFRPshell samplesJ.

Blackbodylike opticalproperties of this composite ensure good absorption of heatingradiation and efficient emission while the composite sample ismonitored thermographically.  Also, parts made of thin CFRP can betypically inspected in both one and twosided tests.Inspecting thick 515 mm CFRP composites of a curved cylindricalshape represents a more challenging task. First, the manufacturingtechnology filament wound shell samples results in chaotic anisotropyand, consequently, a higher surface and volumic noise. Second, curvedshape of samples does not allow efficient heating of larger areas andsurface thermal emission might deviate from lambertian character.Third, defects can be located through whole sample thickness, thusrequiring heating optimization, e.g. substituting harsh flash simulationwith milder squarepulse heating. Nevertheless, onesided tests of thickCFRP composites, even being optimized, are strongly limited by defectdepths up to 45 mm. Oppositely, in twosided tests, it is typicallyConf. 6541 Thermosense XXIX40 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssimpossible to pump enough energy into a sample to ensure areasonable excess temperature on rear surface.The paper is devoted to developing strategy of thermal NDT of thickCFRP cylindrical samples by studying the following issues 1determining anisotropic diffusivity, 2 analyzing noise statistics, 3modeling 3D defect situations and developing inversion algorithms forestimating detection limits and evaluating defect parameters, 4 takinginto account curved shape of samples, and 5 performing experimentsand applying advanced image processing techniques in order toenhance signaltonoise ratio and improve detection efficiency.654134, Session 9Development of thermal response spectroscopytechnique for determination of defect parametersT. Sakagami, D. Imanishi, S. Kubo, Osaka Univ. JapanAn inverse analysis method for the thermal response spectroscopy isproposed for quantitative measurement of size and depth of thedefects.  Sequential thermal response data observed on the surface ofobjective body under active step heating were processed by lockinanalysis scheme based on the Fourier series expansion.  Fouriercoefficients synchronizing with sine and cosine waves were calculated,and they are represented in spectroscopic diagram.  Fourier coefficientsdata of certain defect depth and size obtained for various thermalfluctuation periods showed characteristic curves in the spectroscopicdiagram.  In this study, least residual inverse analysis scheme wasapplied to the defect parameter determination based on the Fouriercoefficient values in the spectroscopic diagram.654135, Session 9Alternative approaches to modeling the thermographicNDT processS. M. Shepard, Y. Hou, J. R. Lhota, J. Golden, Thermal WaveImaging, Inc.Modeling of active thermography using optical excitation has generallyrelied on either numerical finite difference methods, or analyticalapproaches based on an integrated Greens function that result in aninfinite series solution.  Unfortunately, these methods are too complexand require too much a priori knowledge of sample thermophysicalproperties to be useful to the typical NDT inspector.  We have extendedthe series solution approach using observed properties of itslogarithmic derivatives to create a closed form expression for the frontsurface temperature for a plate.  That expression may also be used togenerate a 2nd, simplified model that is suitable for use in normal NDTpractice to determine inspection parameters based on simple estimatesof material properties and infrared camera characteristics.654136, Session 9Defect quantification with referencefree thermalcontrast and artificial neural networksH. D. Benitez Restrepo, Univ. del Valle Colombia C. IbarraCastanedo, A. Bendada, X. P. V. Maldague, Univ. Laval Canada H.Loaiza, E. Caicedo, Univ. del Valle ColombiaInfrared nondestructive testing IRNT is a technique in which thespecimen surface is thermally stimulated to produce a temperaturedifference between sound free of defects areas and eventualdefective regions. It is well known that thermal contrastbasedquantification methods are strongly affected by the nonuniform heatingand the chosen sound area.In previous works, Artificial Neural Networks ANN were used for defectdetection and quantification. Different kinds of data have beenproposed to train and test the ANN, for instances raw temperature,time derivatives, TSR Thermal Signal Reconstruction polynomial fittingcoefficients, phase, phase contrast and thermal contrast.The thermal contrast approach allows evaluating defect visibility andenhancing image quality. However, the ANN defect detection andquantification is strongly affected by the selected reference point.The Differential Absolute Contrast DAC has been successfully used asan alternative method to eliminate the need of a reference point bydefining the thermal contrast with respect to an ideal sound area. TheDAC technique has been proven effective to inspect materials at earlytimes since it is based on the 1D solution of the Fourier equation. Amodified DAC version using thermal quadrupoles explicitly includes thesample thickness in the solution, extending in this way the range ofvalidity when the heat front approaches the sample rear face.We propose to use ANN to detect and quantify defects in compositematerials using data extracted from the modified DAC with thermalquadrupoles in order to decrease the nonuniform heating impact onthe inspection.654137, Session 9Identifying hidden defects in thermal insulation ofrevolving kilns by IR thermographic monitoringV. P. Vavilov, V. G. Torgunakov, Tomsk Polytechnic Univ. RussiaIR thermography is routinely used in monitoring quality of thermalinsulation of revolving kilns used in cement production. As in manyother IR thermography applications, a typical approach tonondestructive testing of kilns is essentially qualitative thus beinglimited by defect detection a standard threshold procedure is used toenhance visibility of hidden defects. In order to evaluate some defectparameters, we have recently proposed a simple identificationprocedure which is based on solving a steadystate heat conductionproblem see proceedings of ThermosenseXXV, XXVI. The assumptionof the steadystate heat conduction is an essential limit in improvingefficiency of defect characterization. In practice, there are sometransient phenomena which affect identification accuracy, namely,spatialtemporal variations in gas jet shape, local deficiencies of thermalinsulation, wind speed and ambient temperature variations andintensive precipitations.In the ongoing research, the abovementioned nonstationaryphenomena have been taken into account by solving a 1D heat transferproblem which involves the analysis of both the heat conduction inmultilayer thermal insulation and the convectionradiation heatexchange on kiln external surfaces.The related mathematical problem is solved numerically. In order toavoid the problem divergence caused by insignificant temperaturevariations, only those temperature increments are considered whichexceed a particular threshold, otherwise a steadystate procedure isapplied.The hardware of the developed IR thermographic linescanning systemremains as described elsewhere, and the new approach to quantitativedefect identification is implemented in the system software with thesystem being currently explored at some Russian plants.654139, Session 10The application of thermal NDE to assist damage repairof the shuttle remote manipulator arm systemK.

Delo, S. Delo, Mission Thermal Infrared Inc.Thermographic data can be used as a supplement to aircraftmaintenance operations in both back shop and flight line situations.Aircraft systems such as electrical, propulsion, environmental, pitotstatic and hydraulic pneumatic fluid, can be inspected using a thermalinfrared imager. Aircraft systems utilize electrohydraulic, electromechanical, and electropneumatic mechanisms, which if accessible,which can be diagnosed for faults using infrared technology.Since thermograms are images of heat, rather than light, themeasurement principle is based on the fact that with any physicalobject radiating energy at infrared wavelengthswithin the IR portion ofthe electromagnetic spectrum, it can be accurately detected withinfrared imaging equipment.  All aircraft systems being tested withinfrared are required to be energized for troubleshooting.  However, fullyoperational aircraft can be utilized for collecting valuable baseline datawhich can be archived and referenced for future comparisons.654142, Session 11Detecting lowvelocity impact damage in compositeplates using infrared thermographyJ. R. Brown, R. Anderson, Hope College D. Visser, Hope ColegeThis research investigated low velocity impact damage in fiberreinforced polymer FRP composites.  Smallscale glassepoxylaminates approximately 200mm x 200mm x 2mm were subjected tovarying degrees of dynamic impact energies ranging from 5 to 20 J andinfrared thermography inspections were performed on the damagedspecimens.  Three distinct damage modes were observed penetrationresulting in highly localized fiber rupture through the thickness of thecomposite penetrationdelamination in which localized fiber rupturewas observed on the impacted surface and additional delaminationoccurred around the point of impact and delaminationreverse sidefiber rupture in which no visible damage occurred on the impactedsurface but fiber rupture and delamination occurred beneath thesurface.  A modified lockin thermography procedure was used in thenondestructive evaluation NDE.  Phase images were constructed byapplying a leastsquares sinusoidal curve fit to a series of thermalimages collected over one cycle of sinusoidal heating.  This methodwas shown to increase contrast for subsurface delaminations comparedto raw thermal data.  Finally, thermography results for FRP compositesamples containing simulated damage backdrilled holes werecompared with thermography results from impactdamaged samples.654143, Session 11The influence of crack shapes and geometries on theresults of the thermoinductive crack detectionG. Wally, B. OswaldTranta, Montan Univ. Leoben AustriaFor thermoinductive crack detection, a metallic workpiece is placed ina high frequency magnetic field which induces eddy currents in a verythin layer of the surface. This eddy current heats up the sample and theemitted infrared radiation is viewed by an infrared sensitive camera. Aninhomogeneous temperature distribution on the surface corresponds toinhomogeneities and cracks in the material. The main goal of thethermoinductive crack detection is on the one side to find cracks andon the other side to determine their depths. For this purpose anexamination of all parameters affecting the result of the measurementshas to be made.In previous publications it has been shown how the thermal contrastTcrackTsurfTcrack depends on several parameters i.e. time, pulselength, penetration depth of the eddy current and crack depth. Allthese investigations were made for rectangular shaped cracks. Butmetallographic crosssections show that real cracks have differentshapes and different angles depending on the circumstances of theorigin of the crack. In this paper results of finite element simulations arepresented demonstrating what kind of influence the different shapeshave to the thermal contrast. It is also shown in which way the crackgeometry affects the temperature distribution on the crack near surface.The calculations take into consideration the distribution of the eddycurrents around the crack for both magnetic and nonmagneticmaterials. The simulations are based on coupled modeling of magneticand thermal phenomena. The calculated results are in very goodagreement with the measurements.654145, Session 11Nondestructive inspection of open microcracks inthermally sprayed coatings using ultrasound excitedvibrothermographyJ. A. Piau, A. Bendada, X. P. V. Maldague, Univ. Laval Canada J.Legoux, National Research Council Canada CanadaWhile other nondestructive testing methods hardly reveal microscopicopen cracks, ultrasound excited vibrothermography provides verypromising results by converting mechanical waves into local heat byfriction.  This phenomenon enhances thermal gradients in temperaturemaps as compared to conventional techniques. To detect temperaturegradients caused by hidden cracks, high temperature and spatialresolution infrared cameras are usually used.Recently, it has been shown that the HVOF High Velocity Oxy Fuelspraying of tungsten carbide or cobalt coatings onto steel substrates,seems to be a suitable alternative to the nonenvironmentally friendlychromium coating material. However one major issue with thesethermalsprayed coatings is the possibility of the appearance ofmicroscopic cracks when they are submitted to excessive bendingloads. If the open cracks spread through the whole coating thicknesstypically 100 to 200 m, they might also propagate at the coatingsubstrate interface causing the coating to delaminate in betweenadjacent open cracks. The latter disbonding phenomenon is thereforestrongly dependent on the distance between adjacent open cracks.Therefore, a non destructive technique enabling the detection of cracksand the evolution of their density is critical to preserve the componentsintegrity.The aim of this work is to investigate the ability of ultrasound excitedvibrothermography to detect such cracks. To do so, we investigatedtungsten carbide coatings where cracks were artificially generatedusing a controlled bending test. Results on different samples arepresented and discussed.Conf. 6541 Thermosense XXIX42 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654146, Session 11Arcwelding defect detection by means of principalcomponent analysis and artificial neural networksP. B. GarciaAllende, J. M. Mirapeix, A. Cobo, O. M. Conde, J. M.LpezHiguera, Univ. de Cantabria SpainThe introduction of arc and laser welding in the aerospace, automotiveand nuclear sectors, among others, has led to a great effort in researchconcerning the quality assurance of these processes. The complexity ofthe arcwelding process has made it difficult to find a generictheoretical model. The specific characteristics of the arcweldingprocesses make Artificial Neural Networks ANN a highly suitablesolution to solve this lack of mathematical foundation, and in severalpapers, different ANN topologies have been proposed to establish acorrelation between some input welding parameters and, commonly,the weld pool geometry or the seam penetration.An online, realtime welding monitor system able to detect instabilitiesaffecting the welding quality would be of great interest, as it would allowto reduce the use of offline inspection techniques, some of them bymeans of destructivetesting, thus improving the process productivity.Among several different approaches, plasma spectroscopy has provedto be a feasible solution for the online detection of weld defects.However, the direct interpretation of the results offered by thistechnique tends to be difficult, and, again, ANNs have been used toidentify and detect disturbances along the seam, like fluctuations in thebead width.In this paper the plasma spectra captured during the welding test iscompressed by means of Principal Component Analysis PCA and,then, processed in a back propagation ANN. Tests performed withstainless steel plates show the feasibility of the proposed solution to beimplemented as a realtime online arcwelding quality monitor system.654147, Session 11Thermal nondestructive evaluation of scaling in boilertubesS. Awasthi, R. Mulaveesala, S. Tuli, Indian Institute of TechnologyDelhi IndiaBoiler tubes in thermal power plants can be classified into water walltubes, reheater tubes, super heater tubes, boiler drum tubes, risersand down comers. Most commonly encountered problems in boilertubes are erosion, corrosion and deposition. Corrosion and scaling arethe major waterside problems in industrial boilers. Calcium, magnesium,iron, copper and silica predominate in most boiler deposits. Thesedeposits usually form a dense layer that impedes heat transfer andleads to tube failure.This paper highlights the modeling, simulation and detection ofdeposited scales, of the order of 50  500 microns, in 3  6 mm thickboiler tubes, by active InfraRed Thermography IRT.IRT involves mapping the surface temperature over a test sample fordetecting surface and subsurface features of the test sample. It is afast, whole field, noncontact and a nondestructive testing method forsubsurface feature detection. Since most solids conduct heat, IRT hasactual and potential use in detecting subsurface features in a variety ofmaterials metals, semiconductors and composites.The present paper highlights a novel data analysis method, based onvariations of slopes in timetemperature profiles, to detect subsurfacefeatures. The slopes are obtained for different pixels in the field of viewof the captured image sequence during transient heating of the boilertube. Relative thickness variation of deposited scales as well as tubematerial loss has been estimated from the calculated slopes.Experimental results are presented in support.654148, Session 11Investigation of metals and metallic composites fordefect detection and fatigue monitoring in the microscale using thermographyN.

In particular, this paper presents the potential of pulsedthermography PT andor pulsed phase thermography PPT forassessing defects i.e. impact damage and inclusions for delaminationson different metallic composites. Furthermore, in this research work,realtime monitoring of damage during fatigue loading usingthermography was attempted in the laboratory on aircraft repairedpanels i.e. composite patch applied on aluminium alloy crackpropagations during fatigue were observed and assessed bythermography. Thermography can potentially provide an effectivemethod to insitu monitor temperature evolution and material stressstrain behavior during fatigue, which can lead to new applications ofthermography in detecting mechanical damage of materials andcomponents in real time. Examples of these case studies are presentedand discussed.654149, Session 11Inspection of aerospace materials by pulsedthermography, lockin thermography, andvibrothermography a comparative studyC. IbarraCastanedo, X. P. V. Maldague, A. Bendada, Univ. LavalCanadaInspection of aerospace components has always been a challenge.Infrared thermography has demonstrated to be a useful tool for thismatter. In this paper, we offer a comparative study involving three activetechniques pulsed thermography, lockin thermography andvibrothermography. Some of these techniques have proven to be moreeffective than others for a specific type of system. We compare theexperimental results from these three techniques as applied to typicalaerospace parts honeycomb structures, composites CFRP, GFRP,aluminum and Glare. The later is perhaps the most challenging of all aswill be pointed out. Some insights are provided regarding the mostsuitable technique for a number of typical situations.654150, Session 12Detection of localized fatigue damage in steel bythermographyJ. Medgenberg, T. Ummenhofer, Technische Univ. BraunschweigGermanyFatigue damage in ductile unalloyed steels as e.g. S355 in the highcycle regimen is governed by localized plastic deformations due tocyclic plasticity and subsequent crack initiation. The spatial extensionof these early microplastic deformations is highly dependent on theapplied stress level, stress concentration at macroscopic notches,surface treatment etc. and can be regarded as an early indicator offatigue damage.During fatigue loading thermoelasticity and thermoplasticity causecharacteristic local temperature variations in tested specimens whichare measured by a highly sensitive infrared camera. A specialized dataprocessing method in the time domain has been developed whichallows separating the different contributions to the measuredtemperature signal. In contrast to other methods  e.g. measuring therise of mean temperature during fatigue loading  the applied methodoffers a very high spatial resolution and though resolves extremelylocalized phenomena.Investigations have been made on cylindrical, notched and weldedspecimens. The results reconfirm the close relation between the localConf. 6541 Thermosense XXIX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 43temperature signal and fatigue phenomena as reported by manyresearchers. However the data processing allows a much betterlocalization and quantification of events as cyclic plasticity, crackinitiation, crack growth etc. In order to verify the findings insitumicroscopic pictures of the fatigued specimens have been recordedparallel to the thermographic investigations.For the purpose of the investigations an automated setup including aservohydraulic testing machine, a long range lightmicroscope, a highresolution infrared camera and a 3axis positioning system has beenbuild up. The setup allows for thermographic and visual microscopicinsitu observations of fatigue damage phenomena.The proposed presentation shows experimental results and furtherconsiderations of an application of thermography to the localassessment of fatigue damage.654151, Session 12Identification of heterogeneous fatigue properties by theuse of thermographyM. Poncelet, cole Normale Suprieure de Cachan France C.Doudard, S. Calloch, ENSIETA France F. Hild, cole NormaleSuprieure de Cachan France B. Weber, ARCELOR S.A. FranceFor several years, the link between fatigue properties and thermalresponse under cyclic loading is investigated. A unified frameworkbased on a probabilistic description of microplasticity allows on the onehand, to describe the thermal effect, and on the other hand, a fastprediction of fatigue limit and its scatter for samples under uniformstates of stresses through thermal measurements. An accurateinvestigation of heterogeneous thermal fields is possible thanks toinfrared thermography. Is it then possible to detect heterogeneousfatigue properties It is shown that variations of fatigue properties in thethickness of steel sheets is accessible. An example is given withdecarburated and nondecarburated HSLA steel. Specific experimentsare chosen to perform  differential temperature measurements betweena loaded specimen and then without loading. A dataprocessingtechnique based on image correlation minimizes artefacts due to thedisplacement of the specimen. Differential temperature measurementsare then compared for both types of samples, showing theconsequences of decarburation on the temperature measurements. Theheterogeneity of dissipation is evaluated by using a 1D model and lastthe prediction of the Woehler diagram is performed and compared withfatigue results to validate the method.654152, Session 12Influence of the mean stress on the thermoelasticcouplingH. Sawadogo, S. Panier, A. Mouftiez, Ecole des Mines de DouaiFranceLord Kelvin first quantified an analytical linear relationship between thechange in temperature and the change in stress where DT is the cyclicchange in temperature, T is the absolute temperature of the specimen,DS is the change in the sum of the principal stress and K is thethermoelastic constant. Thermoelastic stress analysis TSA is based onthis theory. In recent years, experimental data as well as theoreticalformulations have shown a mean stress dependance concerning thethermoelastic constant K. Wong et al. have reformulated the theory andshowed that the mean stress dependence of the thermoelasticparameter is fully accounted for by the temperature dependence of theelastic moduli of the material. Under elastic and adiabatic assumptions,K is given by where Sm is the mean stress.According to the revised theory, a temperature modulation appears at2f, even though the stress is a perfect sine function with f frequency.Then, its easy to show that the second harmonic of Fouriertransformation should be a quadratic function of stress amplitude.Tests were performed on ferritic steel and austenitic steel specimen atdifferent load ratio  R 1, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5. The samples were submitted toa sinusoidally modulated stress. For each, value of the stress amplitude,the specimen were loaded until the mean temperature reached astabilized level. The specimen surface temperature measurement wasperformed with a Cedip IR focal plane array camera. At very low levelsof stress amplitude, we observed that the second Fourier component isa quadratic function of stress amplitude and multiplicative constantdepends of the level of mean stress. For higher levels, non linearityappears and comes from energy dissipation by fatigue damage.If calibration of the thermoelastic response to mean stress can besuccessfully implemented, it is feasible to use the relationship to assessthe residual stress state of structures.654153, Session 12Study of the heat generated by a rolling bearingdegradation by IR thermographyA. Mazioud, J. Durastanti, L. Ibos, Univ. Paris 12 ValdeMarneFrance P. Bremond, Cedip Infrared Systems France Y. Candau,Univ. Paris 12 ValdeMarne FranceOur study deals with the quantification of the energy dissipated by adefect of spalling on the outside ring of a rolling bearing. A previouswork showed a correlation between the thermal heating and thevibratory level generated by the progressive appearance of the defect.First, we propose a numerical model of the heat transfers involvedbetween the rolling elements and the outside border of the bearing cap.In a second time, we developed an experimental setup constituted byan electric engine, two shaft bearings, a turning axis, a rolling bearingwith an internal ring heated by an electric resistance, equipped with afluxmeter sensors allow following the distribution of the temperatureson rings. The rolling bearing is accommodated in a bearing cap whichallows creating the spalling defect in a progressive way. An infraredcamera allows measuring the superficial field of temperature.Periodic impacts generated by a spalling zone are going to excite thesystem mechanical structure. Damping effects transform a part of thisvibratory energy into heat losses that induce a rise of the ringtemperature.The measurement of the temperature rise and the knowledge of thecontact resistances allow estimating the vibratory energy generated byperiodic shocks, and thus to estimate the level of degradation of therolling bearing.The results obtained in this first step are encouraging. Indeed, thedefect generated in the rolling bearing leads to a quantifiable heating ofthe surface, and the numerical model and the experiments allowquantifying the involved flux.654114, Poster SessionField test of infrared thermography applied to biogascontrolling in landfill sitesF.

Infrared thermography can be use to detect gasleakages due to the differences in temperature between the gas and theimmediate surroundings. This method is able to monitor a wide area oflandfill sites, quickly. This technology will not be effective if thedifferences in temperature are not better than five degrees.

Stine, I. Vurgaftman, C. L. Canedy, NavalResearch Lab. E. M. Jackson, SFA, Inc. J. G. Tischler, J. R. Meyer, L.J. Whitman, Naval Research Lab.Recently, significant progress has been observed in the performance ofdiscrete, largediameter 100400 m, longwave infrared LWIRphotodiodes based on typeII superlattices T2SLs, as the result ofimprovements in heterostructure design and growth. To have an impacton LWIR focal plane array FPA technology, however, it is also necessaryto achieve high performance levels in FPA pixelsized devices which aremuch smaller 2040 m and therefore more sensitive to surface effects.Etching to achieve mesa isolation of adjacent photodiodes exposes thediode junction, and introduces surface states that facilitate diodeshunting along the mesa sidewalls. While satisfactory control of surfaceleakage mechanisms appears to have been achieved in midwaveinfrared MWIR T2SLs, as evidenced by the availability of commerciallyproduced high performance MWIR T2SL FPAs, the same cannot be saidfor LWIR T2SLs. Several groups have approached this problem as strictlya matter of surface treatment, using dielectrics to overcoat and stabilizethe chemically treated surfaces, or by epitaxial overgrowth, but withlimited success. Here we describe an approach in which the designs ofthe photodiode superlattice and the overall bandprofile are used inaddition to surface treatment, to suppress surface leakage currents. Inthis approach the WSL is used, since the electron effective mass alongthe growth direction in the WSL is about three times larger than that of atypical T2SL with the same energy gap, resulting in much lower tunnelingprobability. Also, 15 to 20 of the LWIR WSL is composed of layers withhigh Alcontent, which upon exposure to air form a nonconductive Al2O3layer that inhibits transport along the surface. Finally, the bandgap of theWSLs are graded to provide a larger energy gap within the depletionregion of the photodiode. This effectively increases the tunneling barrieras well as reduces generation and recombination processes that dependon the intrinsic carrier density, which is exponential in the bandgap. Wealso employ a sulfurization treatment of the surface of the photodiodemesas followed by encapsulation in a dielectric to stabilize performanceand protect the devices during subsequent FPA processing steps.654203, Session 1256  256 infrared focal plane array based on typeIIInAsGaSb superlattice with a 12m cutoff wavelengthM.

Camera systemswith InAsGaSb superlattice detectors reveal NETD values of 14 mK at acutoff wavelength of lc  5.25 m for an integration time of 4 msec withF2.4 optics.The bispectral camera system, developed for missile approach warningsystems, features simultaneous and spatially coincident detection ofboth spectral channels on each pixel. The detector consists of two spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 45InAsGaSb superlattice photodiodes in backtoback configuration,separated by a common ground contact. The detector is grown bymolecular beam epitaxy on GaSb substrates. Dual color FPAs with 40m pitch and three electrical contacts on each pixel were fabricated in afull wafer process using standard optical lithography.The 288x384 FPA dualcolor InAsGaSb superlattice camera systemshows cutoff wavelengths around 4 m in the short wavelength partand 5 m in the long wavelength path, respectively. With F2.0 opticsand 2.8 ms integration time NETD values  30 mK have been measuredfor the short wavelength detector and  17 mK for the long wavelengthdetector.654206, Session 1Dualcolor IR detection modules, trends, andapplicationsM. O. Muenzberg, R. Breiter, W. A. Cabanski, J. C. Wendler, J.Ziegler, AIM InfrarotModule GmbH Germany R. H. Rehm, M.Walther, FraunhoferInstitut fr Angewandte FestkrperphysikGermanyThe 3rd generation of infrared IR detection modules is expected toprovide advanced features like higher resolution 1024x1024 or1280x720 pixels andor new functions like multicolor or multi bandcapability, higher frame rates and better thermal resolution. This paperis intended to present the current status and trends at AIM onantimonide type II superlattices SL dual color detection moduledevelopments for ground and airborne applications in the highperformance range, where rapidly changing scenes  like e.g. in case ofmissile warning applications for airborne platforms  require temporalsignal coincidence with integration times of typically 1ms.AIM and IAF selected antimonide based type II superlattices SL forsuch kind of applications. The type II SL technology provides  similarto QWIPs  an accurate engineering of sensitive layers by MBE withvery good homogeneity and yield. IAF and AIM last year managed torealize a dual color 384x288 IR module based on this technology. Itcombines spectral selective detection in the 3  4.1 m wavelengthrange and 4.1  5 m wavelength range in each pixel with coincidentintegration in a 384x288x2 format and  40 m pitch. Excellent thermalresolution with NETD  17 mK  F2, 2.8 ms for the longer wavelengthrange red band and NETD  30 mK  F2, 2.8 ms for the shorterwavelength range blue band were reported.In the meantime a square design of 256x256 pixel with a reduced pitchof of 30 m is in preparation. The fill factor in this design remainsdespite of the 3 contacts per pixel required for temporal coincidenceand eo performance at about 80 . The reduced size of the arrayenables the use of a smaller dewar with reduced cooling power andsignificantly reduzed weight and broadens the scope of applicationswhere weight and costs is essential. Design aspects and expectedperformances are discussed.654207, Session 1High operating temperature InAsGaSb typeII strainlayer superlattice detectorsJ. Rodriguez, E. Plis, S. J. Lee, Y. D. Sharma, R. Dawson, S. Krishna,Univ. of New MexicoPhotodetectors made of typeII GaSbInAs superlattice are of greatinterest for midinfrared MWIR and longwave infrared LWIR FPAsfabrication. Recent results have shown it is now a competitivealternative to the well established HgCdTe and InSb technologies,especially for its ability to operate at higher temperature.Previous results reported by our group have shown a pin detector witha cutoff wavelength at 4.6 m, with a conversion efficiency of 32 ,and a specific detectivity of 5x1010 Jones at 80 K, under a 300 K 2field of view illumination. Higher temperature 250300 K performancesof such a device are limited by the diffusion length of the minoritycarriers and by the bandoffsets at the heterointerfaces with the widerbandgap contact layers. In this presentation, we report the recentprogress made by our group on the optimization of the SL absorberthickness, on the improvement of carrier transport at the interfacesusing with the contact layers dopedgraded interface and on anelectrochemical sulphidization passivation process that we haveimplemented. We will show how these parameters influence bothresponsivity and the noise and propose an optimized HOT detectordesign.654208, Session 1Air Force Research Laboratory efforts in SLS IRdetectorsV.

Thistechnology is relatively mature current effort is focused on improvinguniformity of the performance characteristics, and demonstratingincreased Focal Plane Array functionality.  TypeII superlattice InAsGaSb and related alloys based detector technology has seen rapidprogress over the past few years. The merits of this material system reston yettobe experimentally demonstrated predictions of higherperformance and engineering advantages. While no one hasdemonstrated TypeII superlattice detectors with performance superiorto HgCdTe detectors, the difference in performance from the twotechnologies is rapidly decreasing. In this paper we review the statusand highlight relative merits of both both HgCdTe and TypeIIsuperlattice based detector technologies.654211, Session 2IR material research at the Army Research LaboratoryH. K. Pollehn, Army Research Lab.Research on Mercury Cadmium Telluride HgCdTe and group IIIVbased infrared materials is being conducted for the development ofadvanced IR detectors and focal plane arrays. The focus of thisresearch has been in materials for Quantum Well Infrared PhotoDetectors QWIPs, Sb based type II superlattice detectors, Siliconbased substrates for HgCdTe detectors and HgCdTe detectors withhigher operating temperature.For the QWIP detectors a corrugated design will improve quantumefficiency  and operating temperature. Details of these efforts will bedescribed in separate presentations. For the superlattice detectors focalplane arrays in the MWIR spectral band have been successfullydemonstrated and excellent image quality has been obtained. Currentefforts are concentrated on achieving high quality materials andpassivation techniques for detectors in the LWIR spectral region. ForHgCdTe detectors on Si based substrates MWIR detectors have alsoConf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII46 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssbeen demonstrated with high quality, but for LWIR detector arrays ofsufficient low defect densities have not been obtained on a consistentbasis. Recent efforts showing very promising results will be discussed.With a novel design for LWIR detectors and innovative annealingtechniques Auger suppression has been obtained for temperaturesabove 130K allowing for higher operating temperatures.654212, Session 3Advanced HgCdTe technologies in FranceG. L. Destefanis, CEALETI France P. M. Tribolet, Sofradir FranceIn this paper we present an overview of the very recent developments ofthe HgCdTe infrared detector technology developed by CEALETI andindustrialized by Sofradir in France.Today Sofradir uses in production from more than 15years a verymature, reproducible, well mastered and fully understood, planar n on pion implanted technology.This process that allows very high yields to be achieved in all infraredbands from swir to lwir uses the very conventional approach of LPEgrowth of MCT on latticematched CdZnTe substrates. Progress in thisfield is continuous from 20years and has recently leaded to thefabrication of high performance VLWIR FPA 320x256 with cut offwavelengths as high as 20m. Moreover, thanks to the design of theepitaxial structure and to the substrate removal step MCT FPAs presentthe unique features to have a very high quantum efficiency above 70from the cut off wavelength down to the UV. This effect that opens newapplication fields was recently demonstrated in SWIR 320x256 FPAswith cut off wavelength of 2.5m.Above these conventional technologies, the MBE approach is underinvestigation for several years to prepare both the very large arrayfabrication and the 3rd generation development.Very high quality FPAs 1280x1024 with pitches as small as 15m havealready been demonstrated last year using the MBE growth of mwirMCT epilayers on 4 inches germanium substrates, n on p ion implantedphotodiodes and the hot welding indium bump hybridization technique.At the same time, with the MBE growth, bicolour and dual band FPAswhich uses more complex multi heterojunctions architectures both 4layers npn and pseudo planar structures and extrinsically doped MCTlayers were fabricated with formats of 320x256 and pitches as small as25m.A very new area of development concerns avalanche photodiodesAPD made with MCT. This semiconductor presents an unique featureamong all the over semiconductors. Extremely high avalanche gainscan be obtained on n on p photodiodes without absolutely any noiseexcess FK1 MCT APDs act as perfect  amplifiers. Using MBEgrown MCT epitaxial and a suitable design of the structure no noiseMCT mwir APDs with gain as high as 5000 could be obtained in ourdevices. These results open new interesting fields of investigation   forlow flux applications and fast detectors including hyper spectralimaging and active imaging.654213, Session 31f noise in HgCdTe infrared gated photodiodesR. Westerhout, C. A. Musca, J. Antoszewski, J. M. Dell, L. Faraone,The Univ. of Western Australia AustraliaDetermining the origins of 1f noise in HgCdTe photodiodes is importantin the improvement of focal plane arrays.  At higher operatingtemperatures the dynamic resistance of these photodiodes can besignificantly lower than required due to diffusion currents.  The dynamicresistance can be improved by operating the photodiode in reversebias, however photodiodes operating in this mode have large 1f noise.Understanding the mechanisms of 1f within the photodiodes istherefore important in improving focal plane array performance.In this work gated MWIR HgCdTe photodiodes are used to investigatethe physical origin of 1f noise generation. By varying the gate bias thebandbending at the surface can be controlled, thereby affecting thedominant dark current mechanisms.  These photodiodes are based ontypeconversion using a plasma process as reported previously,  whichis simpler than traditional ion implantation and ion milling methods.Fabricated devices have a R0A of mid 10 4 Ocm2 at 77K, and at 2.5Vgate bias 5x10 6 Ocm2.  At trapassisted tunnelling TAT currentdominates in the reverse bias for 77K, and generationrecombinationand diffusion current dominates as the temperature increases.  1f noiseis dependent on temperature because of the change in magnitude andcomponents of the dark current with changing temperature.  1f noisewas found to be strongly correlated to TAT current.  Reduction of TATcurrent will result in reduction of 1f noise and allow for improvedphotodiode array performance.654214, Session 3IRdetectors from 0.9 m to 13 m spectral range at AIMJ. Ziegler, M. Bruder, D. Eich, M. Finck, M. Haiml, T. Simon, J. C.Wendler, R. Wollrab, AIM InfrarotModule GmbH GermanySince 30 years AIM offers highperformance IRdetector modules fordefense, security and industrial applications.  AIM is a global supplier ofHgCdTe, QWIP and Type IISLFPAs and IDCAs for FLIR systems andseeker heads, mainly in the MWIR 3  5 m and LWIR 8  12 mspectral range.  During the last years, this bandwidth has beenextended to cover the whole IR range from 0.9 m to 13 m.  Thisdevelopments have been triggered by an emerging market for remotesensing from space for weatherforecast, climate research, globalsecurity surveillance and intelligence.  Most importantly, the defensemarket benefits from such programs.  One example is the need ofshortwave 0.9  2.8 m detector arrays for lidar, laser radar, and nightglow vision applications, preferably using avalanche photodiodesAPDs.We will present our latest results with emphasis in this paper on MCTmaterial advances and new technologies, presenting typical examplesfor FPAs in SW, MW, LW, and VLWapplications.  To mention a fewhighlights Yield in defective pixels, clusters and NETD has beensignificantly increased. During the last years thermal cycle stabilityespecially of large FPAs has been  improved by using a matchedunderfiller between sensor chip and ROIC. Enhanced homogeneity andsignificantly reduced 1fnoise has been achieved by optimizedprocesses of the planar array technology, especially for LWIR andVLWIR sensors.In summary, AIM offers reliable 9000 thermal cycles, large 27mm, uniform, lownoise, MCT modules from 0.9 to 13 m with optionsfor visible sensitivity and avalanche operation mode. In addition AIMstechnology roadmap will be presented.654215, Session 3Pronounced Auger suppression in longwavelengthHgCdTe devices grown by molecular beam epitaxyP. S. Wijewarnasuriya, G. N.

Reekstin,DRS Sensors  Targeting Systems, Inc.Mercury cadmium telluride HgCdTe semiconductors are of greatimportance to sensing radiation from the near infrared lamdac  1microns to the very long wavelength infrared lamdac  15 microns.Much of HgCdTerelated research and development work is carried outfor cooled operation. Intrinsic carriers play a dominant role specially inthe long wavelength 812 micron cutoff material near ambienttemperatures due to high thermal generation of carriers, resulting in lowminority carrier lifetimes due to Auger recombination processes.Consequently, this low lifetime at high temperatures results in high darkcurrents and high noise. Cooling is one means of reducing this type ofdetector noise. The challenge is to design photon detectors to achievebackground limited performance BLIP at the highest possibleoperating temperature with the greatest desire being close to ambienttemperature operation. A higher operating temperature would result inseveral advantages to an infrared imaging system, such as a reductionin power and weight requirements, thus lowering mission costs. Thechoice of detector architecture determines the type of dark currents thatimpact detector performance. The dominant intrinsic recombinationConf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 47mechanism in long wavelengthHgCdTe is Auger. The electron initiatedAuger1 process dominates in ntype material, whereas the hole initiatedAuger7 dominates in ptype material. Intrinsic Auger7 lifetimes aresignificantly longer than intrinsic Auger1 ones. Hence, ptype HgCdTeabsorber material is preferred for higher operating temperature devices.In recent years, Ashley and Elliott proposed a new class of infraredsensing devices that utilized the phenomena of exclusion and extractionof thermally generated carriers from the active region under reverse bias,thereby further suppressing Auger processes.We have fabricated large area PpiN devices in HgCdTe material with10 micron cutoff at 78 K by molecular beam epitaxy. A principalchallenge was to obtain a low ptype doping level in the piregion. Thispaper will discuss a novel approach to obtaining low arsenic dopingconcentrations and present device results demonstrating Augersuppression at ambient temperatures.654216, Session 3Affordable highperformance LW IRFPAs made fromHgCdTe grown by MOVPEL. G. Hipwood, C. L. Jones, C. J. Shaw, P. Abbott, R. A. Catchpole,M. Ordish, C. D. Maxey, H. Lau, P. Knowles, M. C. Wilson, SELEXSensors and Airborne Systems Ltd. United KingdomThis paper describes the fabrication and performance of LW infrareddetectors made from HgCdTe grown by Metal Organic Vapour PhaseEpitaxy MOVPE. The detectors are staring, focal plane arraysconsisting of HgCdTe mesadiode arrays bump bonded to silicon readout circuits. The HgCdTe structure is grown on GaAs and consists of anabsorber layer sandwiched between wider bandgap cladding layers.Device processing is waferscale. Wet etching is used to define themesas and the mesa sidewalls are passivated with interdiffused CdTe.The GaAs substrate is thinned after bump bonding to minimise thethermal stress on cooling.There are three important features of the design. Firstly, the doping andthickness of the absorber are chosen to minimise dark currents whilemaintaining good quantum efficiency. Secondly, the slots defining themesas penetrate the absorber and therefore prevent electrical crosstalk. Thirdly, thinning the substrate not only solves the problem ofthermal mismatch but also minimises optical crosstalk due toreflections. Furthermore, the devices withstand storage at 70C andtemperature cycling between room temperature and 80 K. Typical diodecharacteristics at 80 K for a cutoff wavelength of 10 m are an RoA of 200 ohm.cm2 and a quantum efficiency of  70.We have made a number of hybrid arrays consisting of 640x512 pixelson a pitch of 24 m. This paper describes the performance of arrayswith cutoff wavelengths in the range 9.4 to 10.3 m. For example, array520903 with a cutoff wavelength of 9.6 m and staring for 0.3 ms at a300 K background in f4 has a median NETD of 20 mK and 0.6defective pixels, where a defective pixel is defined as one with NETD 60 mK. This paper will include results for a number of arrays, adiscussion of the factors controlling defect levels, and LW imageryobtained using the Selex SAS Sigma camera.6542119, Session 3Development of midwave 320  256 infrared focal planearray in KoreaJ.

A. Blessinger, M. Enriquez, J. V. Groppe, K. Flynn, T. M. Sudol, B.M. Onat, Sensors Unlimited, Goodrich Corp. W. E. Kleinhans, ValleyOak Semiconductor, Inc.The DARPA PCAR program is sponsoring the development of lownoise, near infrared 1.5 um wavelength focal plane arrays FPAs fornight vision applications.  The first phase of this work has produced acollection of 640 x 512 pixel, 20 um pitch FPAs with low noise.  Theapproach was to design four different read out integrated circuitsROICs, all compatible with the same bumpbonded InGaAsphotodiode detector array.  Each of the designs took a differentapproach to achieving low noise.  Two of the designs have capacitivetransimpedance amplifier CTIA pixels, each with a somewhat differentamplifier design and with two different sizes of small integrationcapacitors.  The third design is a source follower per detector SFDpixel, integrating on the detector capacitance.  The fourth design alsointegrates on the detector capacitance, but uses a moderate gain, inpixel amplifier to boost the signal level, and also has a differential pixeloutput.  All four designs require offchip correlated sampling to achievethe desired noise level.  The correlated sampling is currently beingperformed digitally in the data acquisition software.  All of the designsare capable of classical correlated double sampling CDS where areference frame representing the signal level early in the integration issubtracted from the final integrated signal frame.  Two of the designsare capable of more sophisticated correlated sampling techniques suchas Fowler sampling and sampling up the ramp.  Each design iscapable of 30 frames per second read out rate, and has a dynamicrange of 10001 using a rolling, nonsnapshot integration.   The designswere fabricated in a standard CMOS foundry process, and were bumpbonded to InGaAs detector arrays.  All four designs are working withoutany significant design errors, and are producing low noise imaging, withless than 50 electrons rms noise per pixel after correlated doublesampling.654219, Session 4Ultralow dark current InGaAs technology for focal planearrays for lowlight level visibleshortwave infraredimagingB. M. Onat, W. Huang, N. G. Masaun, M. Lange, M. H. Ettenberg, C.Dries, Sensors Unlimited, Goodrich Corp.Under the DARPA PCAR program we have investigated technologies toreduce the overall noise level in InGaAs based imagers for identifying aman at 100m under lowlight level imaging conditions. We report theresults of our controlled experiments comprising of 15 InGaAs wafersthat were untilized to investigate lowering dark current in photodiodearrays. As a result of these experiments, we have achieved an ultra lowdark current of 2nAcm2 through technological advances in InGaAsdetector design, epitaxial growth, and processing at a temperature of10C. The InGaAs photodiode array was hybridized to a low noisereadout integrated circuit, also developed under this program. The focalplane array FPA achieves very high sensitivity in the shortwave infraredbands in addition to the visible response added via a substrate removalprocess post hybridization. Based on our current roomtemperaturestabilized SWIR camera platform, these imagers enable a full daynightimaging capability and are responsive to currently fielded covert laserdesignators, illuminators, and rangefinders. In addition, improved hazepenetration in the SWIR compared to the visible provide enhancedclarity in the imagery of a scence. In this paper we show the results ofour dark current studies as well as FPA characterization of the camerabuilt under this program.Conf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII48 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654221, Session 4Extending the tuning range of SWIR microspectrometersJ. Milne, A. J. Keating, J. Antoszewski, J. M. Dell, C. A. Musca, L.Faraone, The Univ. of Western Australia AustraliaWe have developed a microspectrometer based on monolithicintegration of a FabryProt optical filter directly with a HgxCd1xTebased infrared detector.  The tunable FabryProt is created by aparallel plate MEMS fabricated from two dielectric mirror stacksseparated by an initial air gap of 1.4 microns.  We have measuredlinewidths as low as 55  nm, switching times of 40 microsec and atuning range of 380 nm.  However this tuning corresponds to only 42of the desired tuning range, from 1.62.5 microns 900 nm.  The tuningrange is limited by a process called snap down which occurs whenthe MEMS is drive by a voltage source.  It can be shown that for aparallel plate snap down occurs at 13 the initial gap  Complete  tuningacross the IR band requires a physical deflection of at least 60 of thegap.  An integrated ASIC would enable the MEMS to be actuated bycharge control, which would allow full range tunability.  However theadded complexity of design, integration and cost makes the additionalelectronic control unattractive.  We have developed a modifiedactuation scheme which allow at leat 60 tuning of the moveablemirror.  Further, the method developed minimizes stress gradients whichcan lead to substantial bowing of the mirror and subsequently broadoptical linewidths.  We will compare the results of our currentmicrospectrometer with our new extended tuning designs.  Thesedesigns are based on Coventorware and analytical mechanical modelscombined with optical models for the FabryProt.654222, Session 4Quantum manipulation of infrared single photons forupconversion detection, polarization encoding, andquantum interfaceH. Zeng, East China Normal Univ. China W. Lu, Shanghai Instituteof Technical Physics China G. Wu, H. Pan, East China NormalUniv. ChinaQuantum manipulation of infrared single photons may spur manysignificant applications in ultrasensitive detection, quantum encoding,imaging and ranging. In this report, we will discuss our recentexperimental progress in quantum manipulation of infrared singlephotons, such as frequencyupconversion and polarization stabilizationat the singlephoton level in the infrared region.Singlephoton counting in infrared region thus far exhibits a very poorperformance and sets a troublesome bottleneck for many applications.We demonstrate a robust method to realize a stable and efficient singlephoton counting at 1.55 m by means of sumfrequency mixing with astrong pump in a diodepumped unidirectional ring laser. As the efficientinput pump intensity reaches 35 W, the longterm stable conversionefficiency approaches 96 while the background counts are less than600103 s1. Quantum manipulation of infrared single photons can bealso used for the development of some intriguing quantum devices,such as tunable quantum interface and tunable singlephotongeneration.We demonstrated a feedback control of singlephoton polarization thatfacilitates active longterm polarization stabilization to beat theunpredictable polarization scrambling in longdistance fibers up to 100km with a longterm stability over 10 hours. Experimental tests of longterm operations in 50, 75 and 100 km fibers demonstrated that such asinglephoton polarization control supported stable polarizationencoding in longdistance fibers to facilitate stable oneway fibersystem for polarizationencoded quantum communication, providingquantum bit error rates below the absolute security threshold.These quantum manipulation techniques can be readily extended to farinfrared single photons to highlight many attractive experiments, suchas singlephoton control and polarization switches.654223, Session 5Dualband infrared imaging analyses for 256  256 InAsGaAs quantum dot infrared photodetector focal planearrayS.

The testingscheme for thermal imaging uniformity of the InAsGaAs QDIP focalplane array FPA has been proposed and calibrated using a planetyped blackbody source of a high temperature of 373K and lowerambient temperature for the twopoint temperature correction. Theaveraged of specific detectivity D and operability of the QDIP FPAhave reached 1.5X10E10cmHz12W and 98 at 80K, respectively.The dominant noise equivalent temperature differences NEDT oftypical figure of merit for QDIP thermal imaging module operated underthe temperature of 80K, device biases of 0.7 V and integration time of32ms with infrared optics and twopoint temperature correction are 1.12midwavelength IR and 0.11K longwavelength IR, respectively.Meanwhile, it is worth to note that these are the first confirmation fordualband detections of FPA from direct InAs quantum dots matrixembedded in GaAs heterostructure.

Pinsukanjana, Intelligent Epitaxy Technology, Inc.Recently, large format and high quantum efficiency corrugated quantumwell infrared photodetector CQWIP FPAs have been demonstrated.Since the detector light coupling scheme does not alter the intrinsicabsorption spectrum of the material, the QWIPs can now be designedwith different bandwidths and line shapes to suit various applications.Meanwhile, the internal optical field distribution of the CQWIPs isdifferent from that of a grating coupled detector, the material structurethus has to be designed and optimized differently with respect toquantum efficiency, conversion efficiency and operating temperature. Inthis paper, we will present the material design aspects of the CQWIPFPAs. Specifically, we will discuss the system requirements for certainapplications, the theoretical methods in designing the materials, thematerial growth techniques, and the comparison between theory andexperiment, which are performed on edge coupled detectors and FPApixels in fanout circuits.

Endres, L3 CommunicationsCincinnati Electronics, Inc.In the rapid development of GaAs Quantum Well InfraredPhotodetectors QWIPs we have fabricated a 1,024 x 1,024 1K x 1K,812 m infrared focal plane array FPA.  This focal plane array is ahybrid using an L3 Cincinnati Electronics silicon readout integratedcircuit ROIC bump bonded to the 1 megapixel GaAs QWIP.  This effortwas a collaboration of engineers at the Goddard Space Flight CenterGSFC, the Army Research Laboratory ARL and L3 CincinnatiElectronics L3. We have integrated this focal plane into an SEIRbased imaging camera system and performed tests over the 55K77Ktemperature range. As  in previous developments the ease of fabricationof  the GaAs array continues to be a valuable asset.  The overall focalplane development costs are currently dominated by the costsassociated with the silicon readouthybridization.  The GaAs arrayfabrication is based on a high yield, wellestablished GaAs processingcapability.   The broadband long wavelength response of this arraycombined with a markedly improved quantum efficiency is of particularvalue in science applications where spectroscopy is required. One ofthe features of GaAs QWIP technology is the ability to precisely designand fabricate arrays responsive to a particular IR spectral region but thespectral response is typically only a few tenths of a micrometer widelimiting the spectral information content.  By broadening the spectralresponse of this device the applications for imaging and spectroscopyare substantially increased.   In this paper we will present the latestresults of our corrugated 1K x 1K, 812 m infrared focal plane arraydevelopment including fabrication methodology, test data andexperiments.654228, Session 6Small pitch, fullTV format LWIR QWIP FPAs forpolarimetric imagingA. Nedelcu, AlcatelThales IIIV Lab. France and Thales Research Technology France E. M. Costard, P. F. Bois, Thales Research Technology FranceExploitation of infrared polarization signatures can enhance thedetection probability of manmade objects, whose surfacecharacteristics carry the stamp of their origin. Using appropriatedesigns of the optical coupling e.g. lamellar gratings, Quantum WellInfrared Photodetectors QWIPs can be easily turned into polarizationsensitive detectors. The polarizer is thus part of the focal plane arrayFPA, leading to simpler and robust imaging systems.In spite of the obvious interest of QWIPs for polarization imaging, littlework has been published on this topic 1,2. Moreover, these works areconcerned with large pixel sizes   40 m, and extrapolation to lowerpixel sizes may not be valid.After demonstrating the building blocks for small pitch polarizationsensitive QWIP pixels 3 on one hand and fullTV, regular QWIP LWIRarrays 4 on the other hand, Thales Research and Technology took upthe challenge to build a polarization sensitive fullTV, LWIR QWIP array,able to image the intensity as well as the degree of linear polarization inthe scene.In this talk we will present results on the electrooptical performance ofindividual pixels, with special focus on the spectral responsivity and itsdependence on the pixel size. Two different grating orientations havebeen investigated, at 0 and 45 with respect to the pixel edges,allowing the determination of the first three components of the Stokesvector.Depending on the advancement of the global project, we will alsopresent results from FPA characterization.1 C.J.

Malm, Acreo AB SwedenThe ongoing development of QWIP focal plane arrays at Acreo resultedin the launch of several new formats up to 640 by 512 pixels andintroducing major improvements to all products. The achievedperformance and imagery will be evaluated. In the light of thedevelopment of new formats, the results of hybridization a 640 by 512detector with 20m pitch will be discussed. The driving forces behindthese improvements have been the demands from industrialapplications where the requirements for the operating temperature dueto the life time issues are high, as well as space applications where therequirements for quantum efficiency and dark current are extreme. Forthe latter type of applications a number of QWIPs covering the 4 to20m wavelength band have been grown and evaluated. Thesedemands for better performance are met by ongoing increases in lightcoupling, tuning of the quantum well structures as well as improvementof the epitaxial growth parameters. This has led to FPAs that canoperate at 75K and operation close to 80K is within reach. Acreo is alsolooking at other material systems to fulfill the requirements of nextgeneration photon detectors.Conf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII50 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654230, Session 6Toward dualband megapixel QWIP focal plane arraysS.

M. Costard, J. Truffer, O. Huet, L. Dua, A. Nedelcu, J. Robo, X.Marcadet, N. Briere de lIsle, P. F. Bois, Thales Research Technology FranceSince 2002, the THALES Group has been manufacturing sensitivearrays using QWIP technology based on AsGa techniques throughTHALES Research and Technology Laboratory. This QWIP technologyallows the realization of large staring arrays for Thermal Imagers TIworking in the IR band III 812 m.In the past researchers claimed many advantages of QWIPs. Uniformitywas one of these and has been the key parameter for the productionstart. The 640x512 LWIR FPA at a pitch of 20m was the demonstrationthat very high performances could be achieved even with small pixelswhich opens the field for the realization of usable and affordablemegapixel FPAs. Thales has developed for volume manufacture highperformance low cost thermal imaging cameras based on the ThalesResearch Technology TRT 3rd generation Gallium Arsenide long waveQWIP array.Another advantage widely claimed in the past for QWIPs was the socalled bandgap engineering and versatility of the IIIV processingallowing the custom design of quantum structure to fulfill therequirements of specific applications like very long wavelength VLWIRor multispectral detection.

Gat, J. Zhang, M. Li, J. Garman, L. Chen, Opto KnowledgeSystems, Inc. H. Gurrola, United States ArmyIn recent years range optics operations have experienced increasedrequirements for IR capabilities, both in the midwave and longwavespectral ranges.  Previously, such ranges have worked primarily in thevisible, using high speed cinematography.  Refractive and reflectivetelescopes are used in such operation.  However, when transitioningoperations to the IR, the large investment in optics may becomeobsolete.  Refractive optics designed for the visible spectrum do notwork in the IR, and reflective telescopes are not designed to work withIR cameras that feature a cold stop inside the camera dewar.The reflective telescopes can be recoated for IR service, but in mostcases the f of these telescopes does not match the f aperture sizeof the cameras cold stop.  Similarly, the telescope aperture stop doesnot match the position of the camera cold stop.  This mismatchsignificantly deteriorates the image quality.  Moreover, while present dayIR cameras feature a fixed aperture fixed f, the range uses multipletelescopes, each with a different f.  This situation creates majordifficulties in transitioning range optics to IR operations, and also addsa high cost in redesign of equipment.A solution, demonstrated by OKSI and WSMR under the Army SBIRprogram, was to develop an IR camera with a variable aperture  coldstop.  This variable aperture VariApr cold stop operates in the vacuumenclosure and is a part of the radiation shield and cooled to cryogenictemperatures.  The VariAp can be set to match the f of variousreflective telescopes allowing the camera to operate with a large varietyof optics present in the range inventories.  To implement this, a specialoptical relay assembly was developed that reimages the telescopeimage plane on to the camera FPA, while forming an aperture stop atthe position of the VariAp.  The camera also contains a cold filter wheel.The paper describes the new 1K1K InSb camera with the VariAp, therelay assembly, and telescope that make up the system.  The paperalso references the application of the VariAp to GenIII FLIR systemsunder development by NVESD.  The work described in this paperreceived the Armys SBIR Quality Award.654233, Session 8Multicolor IRFPAs made from HgCdTe grown by MOVPEC. L. Jones, L. G. Hipwood, J. Price, C. J. Shaw, P. Abbott, C. D.Maxey, H. Lau, R. A. Catchpole, M. Ordish, P. Knowles, SELEXSensors and Airborne Systems Ltd. United Kingdom N. T. Gordon,QinetiQ Ltd. United KingdomThis paper describes the design, fabrication and performance of 2colour and 3colour infrared detectors made from HgCdTe grown byMetal Organic Vapour Phase Epitaxy MOVPE. The detectors arestaring, focal plane arrays consisting of HgCdTe mesadiode arraysbump bonded to silicon readout circuits. Each mesa has oneconnection to the ROIC and the colours are selected by varying theapplied bias.In a 2colour npn design the cutoff wavelengths are defined by thecompositions of the two ntype absorbers and the doping andcomposition of the ptype layer are chosen to prevent transistor action.The bias polarity is used to switch the output between colours. Thisdesign has been used to make MWLW detectors with a MW bandcovering 3 to 5 m and a LW band covering 5 to 10 m.In a 3colour npn design the cutoff wavelengths are defined by thecompositions of the two ntype absorbers and the ptype absorber,which has an intermediate cutoff wavelength. Between the ptypeabsorber and each ntype absorber there are electronic barriersconsisting of wide bandgap material. At low applied bias these barriersprevent photoelectrons generated in the ptype absorber fromescaping and the device then gives an output from the ntype absorberthat is reverse biased. At high applied bias the electronic barrier ispulled down and the device gives an output which is the sum of theoutputs from the ptype absorber and whichever ntype absorber isreversed bias. Thus by varying the polarity and magnitude of the bias itis possible to obtain 3colours from a 2terminal device. This design hasbeen used to make SWMWMW detectors with cutoff wavelengths of2.8, 4.0 and 6.3 m respectively.654234, Session 8Enhanced numerical analysis of two and threecolorHgCdTe detectorsK.

The noise analysis isbased on the set of noise transport equations and enablescalculations of spatial distribution of spectral intensities of fluctuationsof electrical potential and Fermi quasilevels. In applied method thefluctuations of carrier mobility being the 1f noise source as well as thefluctuations of gr terms as a source of Lorentzian generationrecombination noise are taking into account. The results of calculationsare presented in the form of maps illustrating spatial distributions ofcurrent densities, electrical gain, and spectral densities of fluctuationsof selected physical quantities in single diode configuration. In addition,the enhanced numerical analysis include misfit dislocations and pointsdefects as an additional sources of thermal generation andrecombination, as well as sources of current noise. Photon absorptionprocess includes the dependence of absorption coefficient on Bursteineffects as well as interference effects in heterostructure and substrate.In several cases the theoretical predictions are compared withexperimental data published in literature.654235, Session 8Smart IR FPAs developed in QinetiQD. J. Lees, J. W. Cairns, P. C. Haynes, C. J. Hollier, QinetiQ Ltd.United KingdomSMART focal plane arrays have inpixel signal processing circuits thatimprove the performance of electrooptical sensors and extend theirfunctionality. This paper describes three types of SMART focal planearray that have been developed at QinetiQ aimed at improvedsensitivity, long range object identification and antidazzle.A novel inpixel adaptive circuit is described which improves sensitivityby removing the background photosignal. This allows the detectorstare time to be increased resulting in lower noise bandwidth and anincrease in signaltonoise ratio.The second type of SMART focal plane array described in this paper isdesigned to detect time varying signals generated, for example, byhelicopter blades, jet turbine engines and hot exhaust plumes. Thedetection of temporal signatures enables objects to be identified atsignificantly longer ranges than conventional focal plane arrays.Onfocal plane dazzle rejection circuits which mimic the processingfound within the mammalian retina are the third type of SMART focalplane array described in this paper. In particular, the ability of a retina toshare information between pixels can be used to form a spatial filter.The SMART antidazzle sensor uses novel analogue pixel to pixelinterconnects to form a tuneable spatial filter. The sensor can beconfigured as a low pass, high pass or band pass filter using externallysupplied signal levels. As dazzling radiation contains mainly low spatialfrequencies a silicon retina circuit, which passes only high spatialfrequencies, will reject the dazzle signal. The remaining high spatialfrequencies give an edgeenhanced image of the object.654236, Session 8Techniques for image preprocessing in variable acuityfocal plane arraysJ. T.

The algorithm hasbeen developed with the ability for the near FPA electronics toautomatically adapt the imaging and detection parameters to extracttargets without losing the sensitivity or altering the false alarm or misseddetection rate of existing off focal plane processing systems.  AdvancedFPAs with near FPA  algorithms for precueing have the potential tominimize data throughput bottlenecks from very large format IRFPAs of1024 x 1024 pixels and larger.Improvements in Acuity processing concepts  will be presented toinclude lower SNR detection and preservation of edges made possibleby improvements in the dim target feature extraction. Figure 1. gives anexample of spatial downsampling that can be performed on large andsmall targets in FPA preprocessing techniques.Figure 1.

These sensors are therefore capable of autonomoususe in surveillance and DOD threat detection scenarios.An overview of the signal processing algorithms on real VASI MWIR andLWIR FPA sensors in field experiments will be presented.We will show quantitative data to illustrate the SNR levels and targetcueing capabilities and the simultaneous efficiencies capable by notbroadcasting off the FPA all of the pixels without target information.Also, will report measured quantitative data on the smart sensorperformance such as spatial and temporal processing, preprocessedSignal to Noise, Signal to Clutter, and Probability of Detection Benefitsof modern VASI sensors and compare to existing 2nd generation IRFPASystems.654237, Session 9Albion the UK 3rdgeneration highperformance thermalimaging programR.

K. Steinvall, P. Andersson, M. Emkvist, Swedish DefenceResearch Agency SwedenThis presentation will review some of the work on range gated imagingundertaken at the Swedish Defence Research Agency FOI. Differentkind of systems covering the visible to 1.5 m region have been studiedand image examples from various field campaigns will be given. Inparallel we have also investigated some applications for range gatedimaging together with performance evaluation from both experimentsand theoretical modelling. Example of such applications will bediscussed.654240, Session 9Gated IR imaging with 128  128 HgCdTe electronavalanche photodiode FPAJ. D. Beck, M. Woodall, R. E. Scritchfield, L. A. Wood, M. Ohlson, P.Mitra, J. E. Robinson, DRS Infrared Technologies LPThe next generation of IR sensor systems will include active imagingcapabilities.  One example of such a system is a gatedactivepassivesystem.  The gatedactivepassive system promises long range targetdetection and identification.  A detector that is capable of both activeand passive modes of operation opens up the possibility of a selfaligned system that uses a single focal plane.  The detector would needto be sensitive in the 35 m band for passive mode operation.  In theactive mode the detector would need to be sensitive in eyesafe range,e.g. 1.55 m, and have internal gain to achieve the required systemsensitivity.  An avalanche photodiode detector has internal gain,however, until recently, only visible and near IR avalanche diodes wereavailable.  A new device has arrived that not only provides stateoftheart 35 m spectral sensitivity, but also a high performance avalanchephotodiode.  This new device is the MWIR HgCdTe electron injectionavalanche photodiode eAPD.  Gains of greater than 1000 have beenmeasured in MWIR eAPDS with a gain independent excess noisefactor of 1.3.  This paper reports the application of the midwave eAPDfor nearIR gatedactivepassive imaging.  Specifically a 128x128 FPAcomposed of 40 m pitch, 5 m cutoff, APD detectors with a customreadout integrated circuit has been designed and operated in ademonstration system.  A median FPA noise equivalent input of 5.5photons has been measured on a 128x128 MWIR APD at 77 K.  Highresolution gated imagery out to 9 km is will be shown.654241, Session 9Performance modeling and simuation of rangegatedimaging systemsO. K. Steinvall, T. R. Chevalier, P. Andersson, M.

Rothman, G. Perrais, J. P. Baylet, P. Castelein, J. Chamonal, G. L.Destefanis, Commissariat  lEnergie Atomique FranceHgCdTe Midwave infrared pin avalanche photodiodes, APD, have beenstudied as a function of the temperature and bias, for two type ofjunction profiles, having different nominal junction width. A gain of 5300at an inverse bias of 12.5V was demonstrated in the nominally widejunction pinAPD. The nominally narrow pinAPD showed a higher gainat low bias, but the maximum gain was lower due to an earlier onset ofexcess currents. The gain was measured for temperatures betweenT30150K, and was found to decrease with increasing temperatures,in correlation with the increase in band gap. The useful gain washowever reduced at lower temperatures, due to increased excesscurrent at high inverse bias, indicating a tunnel limited origin of thesensitivity limiting excess current.The noise factor, F, showed on a nearly deterministic multiplication ofthe carriers, with F11.5 up to gains of 5000.654243, Session 9TBDM.

The devices are based on HgCdTemultilayer heterostructures grown by  MOCVD on211 and 111 GaAs substrates. Devicequality heterostructures areobtained without any post growth anneal. The recent improvements ofMOCVD growth were optimized design of the device architecture toincrease speed of response, better IMP growth parameters selectiontaking into account interdiffusion time changes during growth,stoichiometry control during growth by the layer anneal at metal richvapors during each IMP cycle, precursor delivery to the growth zonemonitored with IR gas analyzer, additional metalrich vapor anneal atthe end of growth and passivation of detector structures with wide gapHgCdTe overgrowth deposition. Monolithic optical immersion of thedetectors to GaAs microlenses has been applied in purpose to improveperformance and reduce RC time constant. The response time of thedevices have been characterized using 10m quantum cascade laser,fast oscilloscope with suitable transimpedance amplifier as a function ofdetector design, temperature and bias. Detectivity of the bestthermoelectrically cooled photodiodes approaches 1e10 Jones atapprox. 10 m wavelength. The response time of small area 250x250m decreases with reverse bias to  response achieving 100 ps at140mV.654245, Session 10High frame rate IR imaging using optical readoutphotomechanical sensorJ.

Whereasmicrobolometers detect thermally induced resistance change, thephotomechanical sensor is essentially a transducer that converts theimageinduced temperature change into a mechanical deflection of acantilevered beam. This defection is measured by an optical methodand converted into an electronic image. The photomechanical sensorrequires no external drive for operation and therefore creates nobottleneck for readout data rate. It operates uncooled at widely varyingambient temperature. The use of offtheshelf high speed visible lightsensors allows for high frame rate imaging with no need for customelectronics or ROIC. Results on detection of rapid occurrence events,such as gun fire and rocket travel, are reported. The influence ofdetector sensitivity and time constant on the experimental imaging isdiscussed. Analysis of the comparative frequency response ofmicrobolometers and the photomechanical sensor is presented.654246, Session 10Uncooled MEMS IR imagers with optical readoutN. V. Lavrik, R. K. Archibald, Oak Ridge National Lab. D. Gbrovic,The Univ. of Tennessee S. Rajic, P. G. Datskos, Oak Ridge NationalLab.MEMS thermal transducers offer a promising technological platform foruncooled IR imaging.  We report on the fabrication and performance ofa 256x256 MEMS IR FPA based on bimaterial microcantilever.  The FPAreadout is performed using a simple and efficient optical readoutscheme.  The response time the bimaterial microcantilever was 15 msand the thermal isolation was calculated to be 4x107 WK.  Usingthese FPAs we obtained IR images of room temperature objects.Additionally, image quality is substantially improved by automatic postprocessing of artifacts arising from noise and nonresponsivetransducers.  An iterative adaptive modification of the Curveletdenoising procedure is successfully applied to image output.  We willpresent our results and discuss the factors that determine the ultimateperformance of the devices.  One of the unique advantages of thepresent approach is the scalability larger imaging arrays.654247, Session 10Wavelengthselective infrared detectors based onpatterned resistive sheetsJ. Jung, S. Han, D. P. Neikirk, The Univ. of Texas at Austin A. S.Weling, FosterMiller Inc. J. H. Goldie, Infoscitex Corp. P. D.Willson, U.S. Army TARDECRDECOMPlanar multimode thermal detectors have been investigated for use inwavelengthselective long wave infrared LWIR focal planes arrays.Design studies have shown that they should be able to produce enoughspectral selectivity to allow a threecolor system spanning the 714micron band. To achieve a narrowband spectral response with thesimplest possible fabrication process, we propose the use of apatterned resistive sheet as the frequencyselective absorber. Thesepatterned resistive sheets are a modified form of classical SalisburyScreens that utilize a resistive absorber layer placed a quarterwavelength in front of a mirror.  In comparison with previously designedplanar antennacoupled microbolometers that consist of both resistiveand highly conductive metal strips acting as antennas, the absorptionlayer in these structures involves only a single resistive layer withpatterned holes. Hence, the fabrication problem is reduced from at leasttwo layers to a single layer. We have developed a modified modematching technique to model the electromagnetic response of thesepatterned resistive sheets to achieve the required narrowband IRresponse. Since the design space consists of four geometricalparameters and one sheet resistance parameter, the modified modematching technique is ideally suited for rapid multivariate optimization.To verify the results of this design optimization, the spectral response isalso calculated using HFSS, an industry standard fullwave finiteelement method EM solver.  The results of these FEM simulations willbe compared to those from the mode matching calculations. Finally,experimental results on the narrowband absorption of the patternedresistive sheets in LWIR will be presented.654248, Session 10Uncooled nanoscale infrared highspeed sensors formissile seeker applicationsN. Kislov, Nano CVD Co. M. Sarehraz, Phoenix International E.Stefanakos, Univ. of South FloridaMulticolor capabilities, high detectivity, and quick response are highlyimportant for advanced infrared sensor systems. Photodiodes made ofnarrowband semiconductors are widely used in such applications.However, the photodiodes require cryogenic temperatures and areexpensive. Less expensive uncooled bolometric detectors are lesssensitive, significantly slower, and have no multicolor capability. In orderto overcome abovementioned obstacles, we have been developinginfrared detectors consisting of a dielectric rod antenna DRA inconjunction with a nanoscale metalinsulatormetal MIM tunnel diode.In these assemblies, the DRA amplifies the incident electromagneticradiation, and the induced infrared frequency voltage is rectified by theMIM diode connected between the DRA and the ground electricallyconductive plate, thus transforming the electromagnetic energy into auseful electrical signal. Because of the antennas directional selectivityand using MIM diode having the extremely low tunneling time andnanometer size contact area, such a detector can respond at terahertzfrequencies at the room temperature. It was shown that DRAs made ofhigh resistivity silicon posses low loss and enhanced gain at long andvery long infrared wavelengths. The proposed approach demonstratesthe inherent benefits of nanoscale device manufacturing technique thatis compatible with the existing CMOS technology, which may lead tothe design of low cost sensors andor sensor arrays for use in militaryand commercial applications.6542144, Session 10Highsensitivity 25m and 50m pitch microcantilever IRimaging arraysS. R. Hunter, G. S. Maurer, G. Simelgor, S. Radhakrishnan, J. Gray,Multispectral Imaging, Inc.This paper will report on the development of small pixel pitch infraredFPAs based on the capacitively read bimorph microcantilever sensortechnology.  The heat sensing bimorph microcantilever structures arefabricated directly onto the CMOS control and amplification electronicsto produce a high performance, low cost imager that is compatible withstandard silicon IC foundry processing and materials.  Positionalresponsivities of greater than 0.3 mK have been modeled andmeasured for 50 m pitch pixels, corresponding to a temperaturecoefficient of capacitance, CC, equivalent to TCR formicrobolometers above 30K.  This along with noise capacitances inthe sub attofarad range and nominal sensor capacitances of 15 fF, givemodeled NEDT  30 mK for these devices.   The measured thermal timeconstants for these arrays are in the 5 10 msec range.At smaller pixel pitches, the positional responsivity and consequentlythe NEDT decreases rapidly with feature size.  Modeling theperformance of microcantilever based IR sensors with innovative sensorstructures and pixel pitches down to 17 m indicates NEDTs  20 mK,with thermal time constants in the 5 msec range, are feasible with thistechnology.  Results from detailed thermoelectrooptical modeling ofthe operation of the 25 m pitch pixels will be compared withexperimental measurements from various test structures and integratedcapacitively read single pixel sensors with 25 m pixel pitch.

In this paper wedescribe a novel method of using ultra small Schottky contact diodesas detectors in the MWIR band.The increased cutoff frequency of the Schottky detector wasaccomplished by both reducing its capacitance to attofarad range andalso by reducing the contact resistance. The Schottky detectors werefabricated on InGaAsInP substrates with the doping level as high as 1 x1019 cm3. A variety of detector sizes were fabricated using nanometerTgate technology to reduce the path resistance. The typical Schottkydetector anode size was 0.1 x 1 m2. Planar broadband antennas weredesigned for MWIR wavelengths to couple the radiation into thenanometer size detector. Several different IR antenna designs wereevaluated, including complimentary square spirals, bow ties andcrossed dipoles.A 6x7 array of antennacoupled Schottky detector was characterized atDC, yielding a 20 K zerobias resistance and a responsivity of 6 AWfor the entire array. The arrays were characterized at visible 0.63 m,as well as in the IR 35m and 10.6 m. In addition a THz gas laserwas used to characterize the detector array at 2.5 and 4.25 THz. Thecurrent results for polarization sensitivity confirm that an antennacoupled mechanism is responsible for the measured responsivity. Thepaper will compare the measured results at the various wavelengthsand attempt to explain the possible detection mechanisms.654250, Session 12Nonequilibrium free carriers overcome cooling need inquantum IR detectorsV. Garber, A. Fayer, N. Shuall, Z. Kopolovich, E. Baskin, D.C. SiricaLtd. IsraelThermal noise of quantum IR detectors is defined by the number ofthermal carriers with energy higher or equal to the detectors energythreshold.  The energy distribution function of these carriers is ofBoltzmanntype with a high energy tail dictated solely by the devicetemperature.  Therefore, thermal noise in such detectors can besuppressed only by cooling the device down.Sirica presents new technology for tunable quantum IR detector thatrequires no cooling. The detection is based on the response of nonequilibrium free carriers to IR photons. Siricas IR detector usespumping light NIRVisible to form a steadystate nonequilibriumdistribution SNED of free carriers with a narrow highenergy tail i.e.low effective temperature, which is then used to absorb and detect IRphotons.  Simulations of the SNED formed in the case where the freecarriers lifetime  is shorter than their energy relaxation time ispresented, showing that the free carriers effective temperature, issignificantly lower than the device temperature.Although the total number of carriers in the SNED formed is small, IRphoton absorption coefficient in Siricas detector is very high equivalentto MCT.  This is due to the very high effective crosssection achieved inSiricas proprietary detector substance.  Parameters of this compositestructure will be discussed.654251, Session 12Lowcost far infrared bolometer camera for automotiveuseC. Vieider, S. Wissmar, P. Ericsson, U.

Kvisteroy, Infineon TechnologiesSensoNor AS Norway J. Franks, J. Van Nylen, H. Vercammen,Umicore Optics Belgium A. Van Hulsel, Vito BelgiumA new lowcost longwavelength infrared bolometer camera system isunder development. It is designed for use with an automatic visionalgorithm system as a sensor to detect vulnerable road users in traffic.Looking 10 m in front of the vehicle it can in case of an unavoidableimpact activate a brake assist system or other deployable protectionsystem. To achieve our cost target below 100 for the sensor systemwe evaluate the required performance and can reduce the sensitivity to150 mK and pixel resolution to 80 x 30. We address all the main costdrivers as sensor size and production yield along with vacuumpackaging and the optical components.The detector array is based on a new type of high performancethermistor material. Very thin SiSiGe single crystal multilayers aregrown epitaxially. Due to the resulting valence barriers a hightemperature coefficient of resistance is achieved 2.3.Simultaneously, the high quality crystalline material provides very low 1fnoise characteristics and uniform material properties. The thermistormaterial is transferred from the original substrate wafer to the readoutcircuit using adhesive wafer bonding and subsequent thinning.Bolometer arrays can then be fabricated using industry standard MEMSprocess and materials. The inherently good detector performanceallows us to reduce the vacuum requirement and we can implementwafer level vacuum packaging technology used in establishedautomotive sensor fabrication. The optical design is reduced to a singlelens camera. We develop a low cost moulding process usingchalcogenide glass GASIRr3 and integrate antireflective and antierosion properties using diamond like carbon coating.654252, Session 12Uncooled infrared bolometer arrays operating in a low tomedium vacuum atmosphere performance model andtradeoffsF. Niklaus, C. Jansson, A. Decharat, Kungliga Tekniska HgskolanSweden J. O. Kllhammer, H. Pettersson, Autoliv Development ABSweden G. Stemme, Kungliga Tekniska Hgskolan SwedenUncooled infrared bolometer arrays for highvolume automotiveapplications such as pedestrian injury mitigation systems have to fulfilextremely stringent cost and lifetime requirements. Because of the costaspect, only compact, uncooled infrared sensor arrays such as microbolometer arrays fit these requirements. In this paper we discuss designcompromises at the sensor and system level and how they relate to thesystem performance, to cost and to lifetime. We present a calculationmodel for the noise equivalent temperature difference NETD of infraredimaging systems based on uncooled bolometer arrays. The model isvalidated and benchmarked using published performance data of stateoftheart uncooled infrared bolometer arrays. The calculation model isused to evaluate possible infrared sensor and system design tradeoffsallowing lowcost infrared systems with improved reliability and lifetime,while still achieving sufficient sensitivity required for pedestrian injurymitigation systems. We propose an approach in which highperformance crystalline semiconductor materials with very low 1fnoiseproperties and a moderate temperature coefficient of resistance TCRof about 2.5 K are used as thermistor material for the bolometers.The resulting increase in performance can be used to operate thebolometers in an atmosphere with reduced vacuum requirements, whilestill achieving useful NETD levels. The proposed calculation modelsuggests that a NETD on the order of 150 mK can be reached withuncooled infrared bolometer arrays operating in vacuum pressures ofabout 1 mbar and above. Such specifications for the bolometer vacuumpackage dramatically simplifies waferlevel packaging and ease longterm reliability issues.Conf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 55654253, Session 12Performance evaluation and analysis for carbon nanotube CNT based IR detectorsN. Xi, J. Zhang, K. W. C. Lai, Michigan State Univ.Many theoretical studies have concluded that carbon nanotubes CNTsare promising material for the detection of infrared IR due to theirunique electronic properties, such as he ballistic electronic transportthat makes the noise equivalent temperature difference smallercompared to other semiconducting materials. In order to explore thesepotentials, a reliable nano manufacturing process has been developedto make single CNT based IR detectors. CNTs are first deposited on thesubstrate surface and then aligning them using our newly developedAtomic Force Microscopy AFMbased nanomanipulation system. Thispaper will focus on the performance evaluation and analysis for theCNT based IR detectors. By assembling a single carbon nanotube ontoa pair of electrodes, two Schottky barriers are formed at the contactsbetween the carbon nanotube and the two electrodes. The electronhole pairs generated by photons within the carbon nanotube areseparated by an external electric field between the two electrodes. Theseparated carriers contribute to the current flowing through the carbonnanotube and form photocurrent. By monitoring the photocurrent, theincident infrared can be detected and quantified. Experiments werecarried out to exam the photo response of single carbon nanotubebased IR detectors. Based on the experimental results, the quantumefficiency, dark current, response time and other infrared detectorperformance measures have been obtained. The experimental resultshave demonstrated that single CNT based IR detectors have muchlower dark current and faster response time comparing to other infraredmaterials.654255, Session 13PIR security sensors developing the next generationK. C. Liddiard, Electrooptic Sensor Design AustraliaPassive infrared PIR security sensors employ decades old pyroelectrictechnology for short range detection. This ubiquitous technology is amajor market which receives little attention in the international IR forum.It is, however, a market ripe for exploitation using alternative sensortechnology.PIR security sensors are essentially hot spot detectors, and have anumber of shortcomings, including low sensitivity, low spatialresolution, poor detection range typically less than 25 metres, ability todetect only moving targets thus inability to detect developing fires orelectrical faults, and poor target recognition. Technology now exists oris under development that can address these limitations.The challenge for next generation PIR sensors is to adapt more moderntechnology to this application at competitive cost. Numerous claims tolow cost belie the fact that production sensors remain at least 10 timesgreater than that needed to compete in this market. A major shift inculture is needed, away from the drive for more and smaller pixels andvery low NETD, to what is actually needed and can be developed atvery low cost.In this paper a review will be made of various IR technologies, asapplied to this application. It will be reasoned that only three competingtechnologies are likely to be successful in the short term siliconresistance or diode microbolometers two options of the former.

Conventional antireflection AR coatings provide adequate optical performance but areprone to delamination and degradation due to extreme temperaturecycling and irradiation in space. Consequently, there is an intense needfor improved AR technology that combines high optical performancewith improved durability.

Pillar, Raytheon Space and Airborne SystemsRaytheon initiated development of the DualUse Cryocooler DUC as away of bridging the gap between the typical tactical and spacecryocooler systems.  The stated goal of the program was to produce acryocooler system with 80 of the typical space system functionality atless than 20 of the typical cost.  Initial trade studies led to thedecision to use a singlestage pulse tube design due to the inherentlylower complexity.  The compressor module was to be a dualopposed,self balanced design, making use of a flexure suspension and clearancegap scheme for extremely long operational lifetimes.  The driveelectronics were based on a robust tactical design, modified foradditional functionality and hardened against radiation typical of thespace environment.Development of the DUC system has progressed substantially over thepast two years, including the design, build and testing of a brassboardthermomechanical unit TMU.  Early design efforts were undertakenwith simplicity as a goal, and as a result the brassboard TMU containedsignificantly less parts than typical spacelevel cryocoolers.  Build timefor the brassboard unit was extremely short, with the compressor beingbuilt in a matter of days as opposed to weeks.The brassboard TMU was subjected to characterization testing in bothhorizontal and vertical orientations to address sensitivity of the pulsetube cold head to gravitational effects, and results from that set of testshave been correlated to the thermodynamic model.  Several lessonswere learned as the testing and correlation activities progressed, andimprovements necessary to meet the intended performance objectiveswere identified for implementation in the deliverable system.Significant progress was made in terms of electronics development aswell.  Existing tactical assets were heavily modified for use with theDUC, including the addition of separate drive circuits for eachcompressor motor.  The operating software was modified to enablefeatures not found in typical tactical systems such as firstorder activevibration cancellation.  Ultimately, the brassboard electronics set wasused to drive passive loads as well as an actual tactical Stirlingcryocooler.This paper discusses the DUC development effort and relevant lessonslearned.

The compressor has a full flexure bearingsupport on both sides of the driving mechanism. In the assemblyprocess of the compressor an automated alignment process is used toachieve the necessary accuracy. Thus, sideforces on the pistons areminimized during operation, which significantly reduce the wearout. Inorder to reduce the outgassing potential most of the internal junctionsare welded and the use of all nonmetallic components is  minimized.The outline dimensions comply with the SADA 2 requirements in lengthand diameter.The compressor can be combined with different Stirling type coldfingersand also with the AIM Pulse Tube coldfinger, which gives additionallifetime potential up to 50,000h MTTF.Technical details and performance data of the new compressor will beshown.654279, Session 15Improvements and extensions in Thales Cryogenicsproduct portfolioT. Benschop, P. C. Bruins, W. L. van de Groep, Thales CryogenicsB.V. Netherlands J. Martin, R. Griot, J. C. Bourdaudhui, ThalesCryognie SA FranceThales Cryogenics is working with large effort on the extension andimprovement of its full cryocooler product range.  Due to improvementsmade in the last few years by most cooler manufacturers cryocoolersare  in the defence world  more and more a commodity.  However, therequirements under which cryocoolers are used and the demandswhich users are requesting from a cryocooler such as increasedreliability, shorter cooldown times, higher efficiency, lower inducedvibrations and decrease in size and mass are still very challenging.With as basis his wide product portfolio Thales Cryogenics has workedextensively on the extensions and improvement of its RM cooler rangeand to improve the CDT and robustness of its LSF cooler range forstringent environmental conditions.  For both types of coolers alsostudies have been performed on the actual induced vibrations and onmethods to reduce the effect of these induced vibrations at cameralevel.This paper presents the latest results of the work performed andexplains the gain for the users of cryocoolers.654280, Session 15Performance testing of a large heat lift 40 to 80K pulsetube cooler for space applicationsT.

Ganot, N. Pundak, RicorCryogenic  Vacuum Systems Ltd.IsraelModern InfraRed IR nightvision thermal imagers for reconnaissance,surveillance, recognition and targeting rely mostly on Stirlingcyclecryogenic refrigerators thanks to their high thermodynamic efficiency.Traditionally, rotary cryogenic refrigerators comprised analogtemperature controllers for controlling the coldtip temperature. Thesecontrollers usually consist operational amplifiers, comparators, resistorsand capacitors. The finetuning of the preset coldtip temperature isachieved by setting a potentiometer to a certain resistance.It is known that potentiometers are affected by environmentaltemperature variations, continuous exposure to extreme temperatures,and aging. Another aspect of using a potentiometer is the difficulty forthe customer to change the preset cold tip temperature, particularlywith the RICOR motorenclosed controllers.Moreover, manufacturers of cryogenic refrigerators could improve thereliability and traceability of their products by adding various functionsto the controllers.A digital temperature controller that is based on a highly integrated flashMCU could serve both goals improve the accuracy of the coldtiptemperature, and give extra features aimed at improving thefunctionality and reliability of the refrigerators.The authors will describe the various functions and advantages of anintegral onboard digital temperature controller that was developedin RICOR Vacuum and Cryogenic Systems654284, Session 15Cryocooler selection considerations for gammaraysensor coolingN. GurArye, Cryo Solutions Inc.The prevention of the crossborder trafficking of nuclear materialsuitable for the fabrication of a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb hasbecome a high priority issue for the USA Department of HomelandSecurity and other similar organizations world wide.In order that the flow of commerce is not restricted,  rapid andunambiguous detection and identification of radioactivity in freight andin human traffic is vital. The large number of everyday substances andobjects in freight which are naturally radioactive mandates the use ofspectroscopic detectors , capable of accurate identification of theradioactive isotopes present. The fact that the would be terrorist is lieklyto understand this and try to mask the nuclear signature withshielding or an innocent isotope means that the instruments andsystems employed by the authorities must display the best possibleresolution or isotope selectivity. The best practical sensor is  thecooled high purity Germanium Gamma ray sensor. The ASP DetectiveSpectroscopic Portal monitor systems developed and manufactured byAmetek Corp ORTEC for the screening  of persons, cars, cargo, raileach employ several such cryogenically cooled sensors.The paper presents the main design considerations of cryocoolerselection for this application, where outdoor conditions, coolingcapacity, reliability and low vibrations signature are the main technicaldrivers.Conf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII60 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654285, Session 16IR detector dewar and cooler assemblies for stringentenvironmental conditionsX.

Takinginto account these constraints during the IR detector design phase,Sofradir develop specific solutions to harden them with respect tostringent environmental conditions. These solutions concern both theIRFPA and the cryogenics parts and are described in this paper as wellas the hardened level reached.654286, Session 16Optimal snubbers for the system of vibration protectionof sensitive electronic and electrooptic instrumentationA. M. Veprik, RicorCryogenic  Vacuum Systems Ltd. Israel S.Djerassi, RAFAEL Armament Development Authority Ltd. IsraelViscoelastic snubbers are the indispensable component of the lowfrequency vibration isolation arrangements protecting the sensitiveelectronic and electrooptic instrumentation from the environmentalextremes. Usually, the viscoelastic properties of such a snubber arechosen as to minimise the peak acceleration forces developed duringthe collision while maintaining the peak deflection of the snubber withinpredefined tolerance.The author develops the analytical model of the axial collision of thelumped body with the viscoelastic snubber which is thought of as alinear KelvinVoight body. The experimental testing supports thetheoretical findings. From the simple analysis of collision of the freelymoving body with such a single sided snubber follows the existence ofthe optimal relationship appearing independent of the body mass, preimpact velocity and allowed deformation of the snubber.For the more complicated case, where the vibration isolated payload issubjected to the gravity force and base induced shock and collides withthe symmetric snubber, the author develops the MatlabSimulink model.The optimisation procedure evaluates the optimal snubber providing forthe minimum of the impact acceleration experienced by the collidingpayload while maintaining the deformation of the snubber withinpredefined tolerance.654288, Session 16Portable cryogenically cooled infrared imager how silentit might beA. M. Veprik, H. Vilenchik, R. Broyde, N. Pundak, RicorCryogenic Vacuum Systems Ltd. Israel A. Struckhoff, Kollsman, Inc.For the sake of weight and compactness, the enclosures of the modernportable cryogenically cooled infrared IR imagers are made in the formof a light metal aluminium, magnesium, titanium thinwalled shell,serving as an optical bench and accommodating telescope, an opticaltrain and Infrared Detector Dewar Cooler Assembly IDDCA.Such IDDCA normally rely on the miniature rotary Stirling cryogeniccoolers, which are known as powerful sources of wideband vibrationexport capable of exciting the inherently lightly damped structuralresonances in the imager enclosure thus causing their early auraldetectability when used in a close proximity to the opponent force.Eventually, the aural inaudibility distance became one of crucial figuresof merit along with the overall weight, battery life, imagery quality, etccharacterising the portable IR imager.In the novel approach, the IDDCA is mounted upon the enclosure usingthe silent pad attenuating vibration export over the typical highfrequency range containing its structural resonances. The residual noiseradiation from the imager enclosure is then attenuated practically to abackground level by minimising its volume velocity this is achieved byfinding the magic point and affixing there the optimised lumped mass.The results of the theoretical prediction are strongly supported by thefull scale experimentation. The authors report on successful attempt todeveloping an inaudible at greater then 10 meters even during the cooldown phase per MILSTD1774D Level II IR imager.654289, Session 16Vibration control of a linear singlepiston compressor ina microminiature Stirling cryogenic refrigerator forportable infrared imagersS. V. Riabzev, A. M. Veprik, H. Vilenchik, N. Pundak, RicorCryogenic Vacuum Systems Ltd. IsraelModern portable infrared imagers rely mostly on micro miniatureintegral Stirlingcycle cryogenic refrigerators driven by rotarycompressors. However, a split Stirling refrigerator relying on a linearcompressor having inherently longer life, higher reliability and auralstealth might be much more appropriate for using in this type ofapplications.The state of the art, lowvibration twinpiston linear compressor istypically counterbalanced through opposite motion of the movingassemblies under the tight supervision of sophisticated DSPbasedcontroller. However, a linear refrigerator with a single piston, passivelycounterbalanced compressor would have apparently better bulk,weight, price, power consumption and reliability indices, which are sovital in the above portable infrared imagers. Unfortunately, the industrydoes not offer yet such a singlepiston lowvibration linear refrigerator.The authors report on the development of a novel Ricor model K527micro miniature split Stirling linear cryogenic refrigerator designedespecially for portable infrared imagers, where for the sake of effectivevibration suppression, compactness, weight, price and reliability thetwinpiston approach is abandoned in a favor of a singlepistondesign.Different methods of a passive control of the vibration export from thesinglepiston compressor rely on the optimized combination ofundamped dynamic absorber and heatconductive vibration mounting.The results of the theoretical predictions are strongly supported by fullscale experimentation.654290, Session 16Identification of vibration sources in pulse tubecryogenic refrigeratorS. V. Riabzev, A. M. Veprik, H. Vilenchik, N. Pundak, RicorCryogenic Vacuum Systems Ltd. IsraelAs is known, a cold finger of a pulse tube cryogenic refrigerator doesnot contain moving mechanical components and, therefore, istraditionally thought of as producing low vibration and having extendedlifespan. Because of these outstanding features, such cryogenicengines are especially attractive for use in a variety of vibrationsensitive instrumentation, such as IR thermal imagers, scanningelectron microscopes, superconductive quantum interference devices,etc. However, even relatively lowlevel vibration produced by a cold tipof a pulse tube, resulting from oscillation of a gas pressure along with avibration transmitted from a compressor through a metallic gas transfertube, may sometimes appear to be excessive for the above vibrationsensitive applications.By making an extensive use of the finite element analysis supported bythe fullscale experimentation, the authors are attempting to identify thesources of vibration occurring in a cold tip of a pulse tube.654291, Session 17Introduction to infrared in future soldier systemsG.

Nextto the reconnaissance and targeting device WBBG of the squad leaderand the weapon sight WBZG for the sniper, the socalled Videovisiervideo visor will be used as a new type of weapon sight for aiming andcombating with the German assault rifles G36 and AG36, with themachine gun MG4 as well as with the bazooka PzF3. The video visorincludes an uncooled thermal imager, a day light camera, an eyesafelaser range finder and a digital magnetic compass with inclinationsensor. Communication with the soldiermounted central processingunit and realtime transmission of the video data e.g. into the helmetmounted display of the soldier is enabled by a wireless data link. In thepresentation the requirements, the philosophy and concept as well asthe funktionality of the video visor will be described in detail.654295, Session 17Longrange thermal weapon sights for the German futureinfantryman program IdZR. Breiter, T. Ihle, K. Mauk, M. Mnzberg, W. Rode, AIM InfrarotModule GmbH GermanyIn December 2004 AIM started the series production of the HuntIR longrange thermal weapon sight. The sight is fielded in the Germany FutureInfantryman IdZ basic system and since that time in continuousservice in various out of area missions with German participation.For very long identification ranges 1500m cooled technology stilloutperforms uncooled sights, even with respect to smaller size andlower weight because the typical F1 design of uncooled systemsovercompensates cooler weight for focal length 175mm. The HuntIRsight is therefore based on a cooled MWIR detection module for rangebattlefield surveillance and target engagement. The device specificallyis a perfect match to state of the art small arms like 0.50 cal sniper riflesor 40mm automatic grenade launchers AGL which provideengagement ranges 1500m and need an adequate sight performancebeyond that.A recent modification of HuntIR was done to provide a wider field ofview for improved situation awareness in urban operations andspecifically to allow the engagement of the 40mm AGL in rangesbetween 2001400m. The qualification tests of the sight by the Germaninfantry were successfully completed mid 2006.To match the demand of the followup program IdZES additionalcomponents have to be integrated. Most important are a laser rangefinder LRF, 3 axis digital magnetic compass DMC and a wireless datalink. LRF and DMC together with a highly sophisticated fire controlcomputer provide improved first round hit probability, the DMCadditionally improves the fire control in any case of steep trajectories orfor pronounced ballistic trajectories to avoid any need to precisely levelthe AGL.This new sight is done under the brand name RangIR. An importantadditional feature is the interface for air burst ammunition ABM. Theoptical distance is measured by the LRF, the fire control computeraccurately evaluates the trajectory under the given angle, muzzlevelocity, temperature and range conditions to define the timeofflight.This fully integrated IR fire control system is available mid 2007.The development phase of the IdZES program is under contract, seriesdeliveries expected in 2009. The RangIR will see some specificmodifications for the link and a man machine interface to control thewhole IdZES system components ergonomically from the weapon withoptimized power supply concepts to minimize the number of batteries,chargers etc.Besides the IdZ program AIM is working on a daynight weapon sightproviding daylightlike imaging quality allowing the feature ofidentification of persons e.g. in special mission like hostage rescue byspecial forces.

The German version is called IDZInfanterist der Zukunft.This hightechnically equipped soldier will have some outstandingcapabilities which are based on technical components. One of them willbe a handheld multifunctional thermal observation instrument. This lightweighted instrument includes a thermal imager which detects an objectin 2000m, recognizes it in 1500m and identifies it in 1000m. The IRImage channel can be superposed with the visual daylight image whatis taken by an integrated CCDcamera. The image is seen trough abiocular viewer on two Organic Light Emmitting Displays. With the laserrange finder which works up to 4000m and the Digital MagneticCompass it is possible to measure distances and angles and so theown and the target objects positions. This information as well as livetime video sequences can be transferred wireless to the soldiers C4Isystem.The instrument is based on the surveillance platform NYXUS which wasdeveloped in close collaboration with the German Bundeswehr. TheNYXUS includes additionally GPS, goniometer and northfindinggyroscope which makes it a precise and irreplaceable tool fornowadays armed forces.The producer JenaOptronik is a specialist of optoelectronic systemsand instruments for aerospace and security.

U. Pralle, I. Puscasu, J. T. Daly, K. Fallon, P. G. Loges, A. C.Greenwald, E. A. Johnson, ICx Ion Optics Inc.There is a strong desire to create narrowband infrared light sources aspersonnel beacons for application in infrared Identify Friend or Foe IFFsystems.  This demand has augmented dramatically in recent years withthe reports of friendly fire casualties in Afghanistan and Iraq.  IonOptics photonic crystal enhancedTM PCETM infrared emittertechnology affords the possibility of creating narrowband IR lightsources tuned to specific IR wavebands near 12 microns, mid 35microns, and long 812 microns making it the ideal solution for infraredIFF.  This technology is based on a metal coated 2D photonic crystal ofair holes in a silicon substrate.  Upon thermal excitation the photoniccrystal modifies the emitted yielding narrowband IR light with centerwavelength commensurate with the periodicity of the lattice.  We haveintegrated this technology with microhotplate MEMS devices to yield15mW IR light sources in the 35 micron waveband with wall plugefficiencies in excess of 10, 2 orders of magnitude more efficient thatconventional IR LEDs.  We have further extended this technology intothe LWIR with a light source that produces 9 mW of 812 micron light atan efficiency of 8.  Viewing distances 500 meters were observedwith fielded camera technologies, ideal for ground to ground troopidentification.  When grouped into an emitter panel, the viewingdistances were extended to 5 miles, ideal for ground to air identification.6542100, Session 18EO system concepts in the littoralP. B. W. Schwering, TNO NetherlandsIn recent years, operations executed by naval forces were taking placeat many different locations. At present, operations against internationalterrorism and asymmetric warfare in coastal environments, are of majorconcern. In these scenarios, the threat caused by pirates onboard ofsmall surface targets, such as jetskis and fast inshore attack crafts, isincreasing. In the littoral environment, the understanding of itscomplexity and the efficient use of the limited reaction time, areessential for successful operations. Presentday electrooptic sensorsuites, also incorporating Infrared Search and Track systems, can beused for varying tasks such as detection, classification andidentification. By means of passive electrooptic systems, such asinfrared and visible light sensors, improved situational awareness canbe achieved. For long range capability, elevated sensor masts and flyingplatforms, are ideally suited for the surveillance task and improvesituational awareness. A primary issue is how to incorporate newelectrooptic technology and signal processing into the new sensorconcepts, to improve system performance. It is essential to derivedaccurate information from the high spatialresolution imagery createdby the EO sensors. As electrooptic sensors do not have allweathercapability, the performance degradation in adverse scenarios must beunderstood, in order to support the operational use of adaptive sensormanagement techniques. In the paper we discuss the approach takenat TNO in the design and assessment of system concepts for futureIRST development.

An even further advancedversion of this firing post is now under development in the frame of arange extension of the missile system dubbed MILAN ADTER.Being a commandtolineofsight system, the new MILAN ADT firingpost is equipped with a missile tracking sensor which captures themissiles signature with a wide fieldofview optics and a large CMOSdetector covering both gathering and guidance phase. Using adaptivewindowing and subsampling functions combined with differentialimaging modes this sensor tracks the signatures of all MILAN missiletypes with optimum precision, high resistance against IRCM, andimproved signaltonoise ratio over the entire flight path.An integrated thermal imager replaces the earlier ancillary TIs, MIRA andMILIS. The TI image is displayed on an internal micromonitor andprojected into the eyepiece. Optimum axis harmonization between bothmissile tracking and sighting channels is ensured by projection ofreference marks into each optical sensor path from a commonmultispectral projector.An extended range version will also be offered which takes advantage ofthe missile tracking sensors enhanced responsivity and the precision ofaxis alignment. An integrated color TV sensor substitutes the bulky directview telescope, andboth TI TVsensor will provide two fieldsofview onthe internal micromonitor for surveillance and target identification,respectively.6542110, Session 19TED a novel miniaturized infrared detection andsituation awareness systemG.

Fendt, R. Florian, W. Kieslich, T. Kuligk, EADSLenkflugkoerper GmbH GermanyWhen the field of operation of precision strike groundairtogroundmissiles is extended to beyondlineofsight missions autonomousseekers will soon encounter serious difficulties, especially with regard tolow signature targets and complex scenarios.We have investigated dualmode sensors which are conceived toovercome these specific problems by combining an imaging sensorwith a semiactive laser seeker. These sensors offer nonlineofsighttarget engagement with high reliability and under operator control usinga laser target designator while minimizing the active exposure time fortarget designation by handing over the tracking process once thepassive imaging sensor has locked onto the target.For this purpose a laboratory demonstrator has been built with astandard TVsensor and an InGaAs 4quadrant detector mounted on a2axis gimbal system. Both detectors use a common objective thefocussed radiation is divided by a spectral beam splitter.The signals of the 4quadrant detector are digitized and subsequentlyprocessed by an FPGA. If the preprogrammed laser pulsecharacteristic is identified the position information is evaluated and thegimbal system activated in order to center the laser spot. Subsequentlya tracker locks onto the target signature found in the imaging sensorsignal. Once lockon is confirmed the laser can be turned offautomatically.We present the results of laboratory and field tests obtained with thedualmode demonstrator. Based on these results we plan to replace theTVsensor by an uncooled microbolometer detector in the future. Thedesign and expected performance of such a dualmode sensor will bediscussed.6542112, Session 19Track extraction algorithms for rocket motor ejectaC. L. Edwards, M. P. Mattix, L. M. Howser, L. R. Gauthier, JohnsHopkins Applied Physics Lab.A Bolometer IR Camera recently captured IR images of motor ejecta orchuff during two rocket booster flight missions.  This paper summarizesand compares the chuff tracking algorithms that were used for the twomissions.  Initial algorithms had very little predictive capability for frametoframe object estimation.  Improved algorithms leverage manyadditional physical properties of the chuff to enhance the algorithmsperformance in the frametoframe association and discrimination ofobjects.  The enhanced algorithms also record statistics of trackedchuffs physical parameters including size, speed, direction, intensity,peakpixel intensity and position.  The developed predictive capabilityutilizes the statistical history of the chuff tracks to anticipate future chufflocation.  The pieces of chuff in a new frame are compared to theprediction and statistical track history with tolerances proportional toConf. 6542 Infrared Technology and Applications XXXIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 65the track parameters standard deviation of truncated statistics.Truncated statistics utilize the recent track historys stronger correlationto a chuffs future physical parameters.

Konsin, Mine Safety Appliances Co.Fire Service and First Responder Thermal Imaging Camera TICapplications are growing, saving lives and preventing injury andproperty damage.  Firefighters face a wide range of serious hazards.TICs help mitigate the risks by protecting Firefighters and preventinginjury, while reducing time spent fighting the fire and resources neededto do so. Most fire safety equipment is covered by performancestandards.  Fire TICs are not, subject to inadequate operationalperformance and insufficient user training.  Meanwhile, advancementsin Fire TICs and lower costs are driving product demand.  The need fora Fire TIC Standard was spurred in late 2004 through a Governmentsponsored Workshop where experts from the First Respondercommunity, component manufacturers, firefighter training, and thosedoing research on TICs discussed strategies, technologies, procedures,best practices and RD that could improve Fire TICs.  The workshopidentified pressing image quality, performance metrics, and standardsissues. Durability and ruggedness metrics and standard testingmethods were also seen as important, as was TIC training andcertification of endusers.  A progress report on several efforts in theseareas and their impact on the IR sensor industry will be given.  Thispaper is a follow up to the SPIE Orlando 2004 paper on Fire TIC usageentitled Emergency Responders Critical Infrared which explored thetechnological development of this IR industry segment from theviewpoint of the end user, in light of the studies and reports that hadestablished TICs as a mission critical tool for firefighters.6542114, Session 20FabryProt MEMSbased integratedmicrospectrometers spanning the SWIR and MWIRA.

Faraone, The Univ. of Western Australia AustraliaWideband capable microspectrometers enable a broad range of rapidlytunable hyperspectral IRFPA imagers and spectroscopic analysissystems to be developed.  We have developed a microspectrometerbased on monolithic integration of a parallel plate MEMS optical filterdirectly with a HgxCd1xTebased infrared detector.  The primarytechnical challenge in achieving the integration of a MEMS FabryProtfilter with the HgxCd1xTe detector is to keep the processingtemperature less than 125C, as the performance of HgxCd1xTe baseddetectors degrades at higher process.  In this work measured resultsand design issues for microspectrometers operating in the 1.52.6microns SWIR and the 35 microns MWIR wavelength range arepresented.  In the SWIR, measurements indicate linewidths as low as 55nm, switching times of 40 microsec and a tuning ranges of 380 nmwhich is limited by parallelplate snapdown.  In the MWIR, linewidths of210 nm, switching times of 20 microsec and a tuning range of 900 nmhave been achieved.  The tuning speed is limited by squeezed filmdamping due to the physically narrow gap lambda2 between theFabryProt mirrors Nevertheless, switching times are more thansuitable for highspeed, full frame rate IRFPA.  Bowing of the moveableFabryProt mirror due to stress gradients is identified as the dominatesource of linewidth broadening.  The integration of a MEMS tunableFabryProt filter capable of continuous tuning within a given band anda HgxCd1xTe detector capable of being designed for any IR bandshould enable this microspectrometer to be used in a wide array of lowcost spectroscopic applications.6542115, Session 20The Infrared Cloud Ice Radiometer IRCIRJ.

This paper will present dataand analysis of excess low frequency noise in LWIR Cutoff  10.5 um 60 K HDVIP HgCdTe detectors.The vehicle for noise measurements is a multiplexed 320 x 6 array of 40um x 50 um, 10.5 um cutoff, HgCdTe detectors. Noise has beenmeasured on a column of 320 detectors, at 60 K, as a function offrequency under dark and illuminated conditions, at zero and 50 mVreverse bias. Integration time for the measurement was 1.76 ms. Outputvoltage for the detectors was sampled every 100th frame. 32,768frames of time series data were collected for a total record length of 98minutes. Since the total time for collecting the 32,768 time data seriespoints is 98 minutes, the minimum frequency is 170 uHz. At present,time series and Fourier transform data on individual detectors at 50 mVreverse bias in the dark have been studied. Examination of the detectorcurrent time series and Fourier transform curves thereof, reveal a varietyof interesting characteristics i time series displaying switchingbetween two states characteristic of random telegraph signal RTSnoise, the noise current power spectrum having Lorentzian typecharacteristics ii time series data exhibiting slight wavelikecharacteristics with the noise current power spectrum being 1flike atlow frequencies iii pronounced wavelike characteristics in the timeseries with the noise current power spectrum being 1f2like at lowfrequencies and iv time series having a mean value independent oftime with the noise current power spectrum being white.

Time series and noise for other conditions underwhich data was obtained zero bias dark, zero bias illuminated, and 50mV reverse bias illuminated are to be examined to determine changesin behavior under different operating conditions.6542120, Session 21Spatial resolution of SCDs InSb 2D detector arraysI. Shtrichman, T. Fishman, U. Mizrahi, V. Nahum, Z. Calahorra,SemiConductor Devices IsraelThe twodimensional spatial response of a pixel in SCDs backsideilluminated InSb focal plane array FPA is directly measured for arraysof small pitch, namely, 30, 20 and 15 m. The characterization methoduses spotscan measurement and deconvolution algorithm, resulting inthe net pixel spatial response. Two independent methods are used tomeasure the detector spatial response a direct spotscan of a pixelwith a focused beam b uniform illumination upon backsideevaporated thin gold mask, in which subpixel apertures are distributedin precise positions across the array. The experimental results arecompared to a numerical 3D simulation with excellent agreement for allpitches. The spatial response is used for calculating the crosstalk andthe modulation transfer function MTF of the pixel. We find that for allthree pixel dimensions, the net spatial response width FWHM is equalto the pitch, and the MTF width is inversely proportional to the pitch.Thus, the spatial resolution of the detector improves with decreasingpixel size as expected, and should not limit the overall resolution of anobservation system for all the discussed InSb FPA pitch values.6542121, Session 21Sigmadelta columnwise AD conversion for cooledROICF.

Among the various ADC architectures, like dualramp,successive approximation or oversampled converters, the best choicestrongly depends on the application.

Billon Lanfrey, A. Combette, F. P. Pistone, M. Vuillermet, SofradirFranceThe Non Uniformity Correction NUC performance of infrared 2Dstaring arrays is a key factor to ensure the best IR image quality at thecamera level. SOFRADIR has carried on studies to improve both theNUC performance and the correction table stability over the timeperiods, the readout integrated circuit configuration and theenvironmental conditions. Indeed, works have been performed on theimprovement of HgCdTe wafer layers homogeneity and uniformity forboth Liquid Phase Epitaxy LPE and Molecular Beam Epitaxy MBEgrowth techniques, on the improvement of the readout circuit linearityand on the optimization of the dewar optical interface. Thanks to theseimprovements, Sofradir offers to its customers high level NUCperformances as well as excellent correction table stability for the shortwave, mid wave and long wave infrared bands. Thus, the calibrationsconstraints are reduced at the camera level and the image quality isoptimized over a large operating condition ranges. These results arepresented in this paper for different types of IR detectors and differentwavebands.6542125, Session 21aScenebased nonuniformity correction using texturebased adaptive filteringD. R. Droege, L3 Communications Cincinnati Electronics, Inc.The detectors within an infrared focal plane array FPA characteristicallyhave responses that vary from detector to detector.  It is desirable toremove this nonuniformity for improved image quality.  Factorycalibration is not sufficient since nonuniformity tends to drift over time.Field calibration can be performed using uniform temperature sourcesbut requires briefly obscuring the fieldofview and leads to additionalsystem size and cost.  Alternative scenebased approaches are ableto utilize the normal scene data when performing nonuniformitycorrection NUC and therefore do not require the fieldofview to beobscured.  These function well under proper conditions but at times canintroduce image artifacts such as ghosting.  These artifacts generallyresult when a portion of the scene is not optimal for NUC.  The scenebased approach presented in this paper estimates a correction term foreach detector using spatial information.  In parallel, motion estimationand texture segmentation are used to identify regions in the scene thatare suitable for NUC.  This information is then employed to adaptivelyconverge to the proper bias term for each detector in the FPA.  Resultsusing both synthetic and actual data sets demonstrate the advantagesof this approach.  Implementation options are also investigated.6542126, Session 21aNonuniformity correction algorithm based on a noisecancellation system for infrared focal plane arraysS. E. Godoy, S. N. Torres, Univ. de Concepcin Chile J. E. Pezoa,M. M. Hayat, The Univ. of New Mexico Q. Wang, Shanghai JiaoTong Univ. ChinaIn this paper a novel nonuniformity correction method thatcompensates for the fixedpattern noise FPN in infrared focalplanearray sensors is developed. The proposed NUC method compensatesfor the additive component of the FPN statistically processing thetemporal signal using a noisecancellation system. The mainassumption of the method is that a source of noise correlated to theadditive noise of the infrared focalplane array is available to thesystem. Using such assumption as well as the readout imagery, a finiteimpulse response FIR filter is designed and an estimate of the additivenoise is synthesized. This estimate is then subtracted to the readoutdata in order to produce a filtered version of the corrupted imagery. Theperformance of the proposed system and its ability to compensate forthe FPN are tested with infrared images corrupted by both real andsimulated nonuniformity.6542145, Session 21aA resistance nonuniformity correction method usingbias heating for resistive type uncooled microbolometerFPAsT. Akin, M. Tepegoz, Middle East Technical Univ. TurkeyMicrobolometertype uncooled thermal detector focal plane arraysFPAs suffer from pixeltopixel resistance variation, which isconventionally corrected by applying a specific bias voltage to eachdetector by the use onchip DACs.  The proposed method in this paperuses the bias heating of the detector where the detector is heatedupfor a predetermined period of time before the readout phase.Assuming that the detector active material has negative TCR, thedetector resistance can only be decreased using bias heating.  Due tothis, a correction resistance with 5 of the mean detector resistance isembedded into the readout circuit which is used to increase theresistance seen by the readout circuit for the detectors havingresistances smaller than the mean value.  The proposed method usesonly a current source and simple digital blocks for each column,eliminating the need of DACs that occupy large silicon area, contributeto the noise floor of the system, and dissipate large power.  Theresistance correction resolution of the proposed method is 37.5 Ohmfor a 5 MHz digital clock frequency, a 100 kOhm detector resistance, a1E9 thermal capacitance, 0.03 K TCR, and 25 uA heating currentthis correction resolution corresponds to more than 12bit DACresolution where a conventional CTIA structure with a 2 V detector biasand a 5 V maximum DAC voltage is used.654266, Poster SessionPixelwise readout integrated circuits with pixellevel ADCfor microbolometersC.

It is necessary to use a pixelwise readout architecture fordecreasing the thermal noise. However, it is hard to locate a sufficientlylarge integration capacitor in a pixel of FPAs because of the arealimitation. To effectively overcome this problem, a two step integrationmethod is proposed.First, after integrating the microbolometer current for 32  s, upper 5bitsof the 13bit digital signal are output through a pixellevel ADC.

D. Saginov, A. M. Filachev, A. N. Sviridov, A. Kononov, N. V.Kravtchenko, Orion Research and Production Association RussiaThe optical scheme of a multispectral thermal imager MSTI isconsidered using a staring thermal imager and interferometersestablished at Brewster angle of incidence to the axis of the sightingdevice. The calculations of sensitivity, resolving power and otherparameters of this device were conducted.In the  MSTI considered the filtration of received radiation is implementedowing to the multibeam interference of beams polarized in a planeperpendicular to the plane of incidence in interferometers positioned atBrewster angle of incidence to the axis of the optical system Theinterferometers were made from flat optically polished laminas from amaterial with high refractive index, transparent for the filtrated radiation.As interferometers were placed at the Brewster angle of incidence to theoptical axis several important characteristics were obtained The reflection coefficient of beams polarized in a plane of aperpendicular plane of incidence increases, and, therefore, the Qqualityand spectral resotution of interferometers also increase There is an increase of the spectral interval between the adjacent passbands of interferometers, and, therefore, there is a capability of increaseof spacing interval between mirrors and Qfactor of interferometers There appears a possibility to avoid negative influence of the  parasiticinterference between the mirrors of the adjacent interferometers.To enable the activity of the MSTI in other spectral ranges, the mirrors ofinterferometers have no reflecting coatings.The offered MSTI allows To log fast processes, by obtaining in one frame the instantaneousphoto with multicolored strips To provide fast switching of operational modes of the device from themode of  multispectral thermal imaging  to the mode of customarythermal imaging , by turning the  polaroid placed in front of the chilledfilter of the photodetector To provide functioning in several spectral ranges i.e. in other orders ofthe interference by replacing the chilled band pass filter in front of thephotodetector or replacing the chilled filter together with thephotodetector.6542116, Poster SessionAn infrared solution to a national priority NASA icedetection and measurement problemT.

W. Kwon, C. H. Hwang, T. S. Kim, Y. S. Lee, H. C. Lee, KoreaAdvanced Institute of Science and Technology South KoreaBy adopting new capacitance reading scheme, a capacitive typeuncooled infrared detector structure with high fillfactor and effectivelycontrollable thermal conductance is proposed. Instead of conventionalMEMS capacitor structure i.e. an insulating gap between top andbottom electrodes, a capacitor with a floating electrode and twobottom electrodes has been applied to the infrared detector. Infraredabsorber which also acts as floating electrode of the capacitor isconnected to the substrate via two bimaterial legs. These legs areconsisted of two materials having large difference in thermal expansioncoefficient Al25ppmK and SiO20.35ppmK. However, the one end tipof the bimaterial leg does not contain Al and only consist of SiO2, sothat the absorber can be separated from the substrate thermally as wellas electrically. The capacitance change by the result of infraredabsorption is read only through two bottom electrodes which are placedright under the absorber, and also perform as infrared reflectors. Thedesign has advantages of enlarging fillfactor of the infrared detector,effective thermal conductance controlling and high sensitivity to IR.With only small dimensions of SiO2 5m x 2m x 0.1m, the devicecan have low thermal conductance of 1.3x107WK, so that the portionof the legs can be reduced in a pixel area. The device has fillfactor of0.84 and 15.4K of sensitivity to infrared rays concerning 5K oftemperature difference between the structure and the substrate.6542131, Poster SessionSuccessful MWIR FPA fabrication using gas cluster ionbeam InSb surface finishingL.

To meet the resolution andsensitivity requirements for high performance midwavelength infraredMWIR FPA imaging systems in the 1 to 5.4 micron region 77K, thesurface of the material as well as the bulk crystal must be of excellentquality.  Chemomechanicalpolishing has proven to be a qualified andsteadfast finishing process for InSb surfaces in the fabrication ofIRFPAs. However, a time consuming surface etch of the InSb isuniversally required at some point in the IRFPA manufacturing process.Gas cluster ion beam processing GCIB has been shown tosignificantly enhance the surface oxide desorption of both GaSb andInSb substrates for MBE growth and provides an alternate surface finishto CMP for InSb based FPA processing.

A. Demyanenko, Z. A. Evgenievich, Institute of SemiconductorPhysics RussiaAmong all uncooled infrared detectors resistive microbolometer focalplane arrays FPA are the most perspective for applications notrequiring ultimate parameters typical for cryogenic FPAs. Variations inparameters from element to element of microbolometer FPA, mainly intemperature coefficient of resistance, give rise to various temperaturedependencies of output signals corresponding to different elements. Itin turn gives rise to nonuniformities in response characteristics whentemperature of FPA changes and demands its stabilization withaccuracy better 0.1 . Application a nonuniform corrective biases tothe individual microbolometers for equalization temperaturedependencies of FPA output signals, proposed and realized by IndigoSystems Corporation, allows to reduce requirement to FPA temperaturestabilization up to 5 degrees. Further reduction of this requirement up toremoval of the thermoelectric cooler from infrared microbolometersystems is in present realized by means additional realtime correctionof output signal andor bias voltages in depending on currenttemperature.This paper describes improved bias equalization method for control ofmicrobolometer FPA uniformity at substrate temperature change. Thisapproach uses in general case thermallyshorted and heatinsulatedshielded from infrared radiation compensating bolometers instead onlythermallyshorted ones and two additional bias impulses to equalizationvariations in temperature dependencies of dark output signals. It allowsto equalize temperature coefficient of resistance not only in sensitivebolometers but also in compensating ones and as result significantlyimprove equalization quality. Numerical simulation two proposed FPAarchitectures in compare with Indigo Systems ones shows that newequalization method allows to control microbolometer array nonuniformity under 50 mK level over 20 K range of substrate temperature.This probably will allows to apply microbolometer FPAs indoors withoutuse the additional measures such as temperature stabilization and realtime correction.6542133, Poster SessionA highSNR readout circuit design for TDI array withadaptive charge capacity controlC. B. Kim, C. H. Hwang, Y. S. Lee, H. C. Lee, Korea AdvancedInstitute of Science and Technology South KoreaInfrared imaging system is a very important instrument in a satellitesystem and the infrared image getting from the satellite is very useful inweather forecast. Among many information acquired from the satelliteinfrared image, cloud top temperature CTT is important inunderstanding the phenomena of atmosphere. CTT is much lower thanthe surface temperature, so the infrared intensity of cloud top is verylow. For a low IR radiation, signal current is decreased but total noise isnot decreased because shot noise resulting from the detector isdecreased proportional to decreased signal but readout noise is thesame regardless of the reduced signal. Thus SNR is significantlyreduced at low radiation. For this reason, we proposed an adaptivecharge capacity control method to measure more exact temperature inthe low temperature range. TDI array looks at a fixed scene n times,where n is a TDI depth. From the result of the first integration time forthe scene, we can anticipate the intensity of the scene. So, if wechange the charge capacity adaptively according to the incomingradiation intensity, we can get increased SNR and enlarged dynamicrange. For the low intensity, we integrate the detector current into asmall integration capacitor. And for the high intensity, we integrate thedetector current into a large integration capacitor. As a result, thisadaptive charge capacity control amplifies the low radiation signalwithout increasing readout noise. Moreover, high radiation signal can beintegrated without saturation, so dynamic range is increased. By thesimulation it is found that SNR is increased by 13.5dB at 200K anddynamic range is enlarged by 13.3dB.6542134, Poster SessionDim moving target detection based on detection indexusing local gamma correction and motion informationJ. Kim, Kyungpook National Univ. South Korea K. Kim, Agency forDefense Development South Korea D. Kim, Kyungpook NationalUniv. South KoreaModern Infrared Search and Track IRST system is the essentialdefense technique against an attack of the cruise missiles and the lowerinfiltration flights. The signature of their threats is typically much lessintensive than intensity of cluttered background with noise. Thisnecessitates the development of efficient detection technology forrobust and reliable target detection in cluttered background with noise.Conventional studies show that the trackbeforedetect TBDalgorithms provide a powerful processing technique for detecting dimmoving low observable target under low SNR conditions. However,these algorithms were often extremely sensitive to background or noiseand too computationally expensive to be applicable in real situations.This paper introduces a novel adaptive algorithm for target detection.The algorithm is proposed on the basis of robust and adaptive methodthat is invariant to the prior uncertainty with respect to statisticalproperties of cluttered background and noise. The essence of proposedalgorithm is to design the detection index over two images obtained byprocessing the given image through the local gamma correction and theestimation of target motion. And the detection index is obtained by thethree factors which calculated relations between two imagescorrelation rate CLR, luminance rate LR, and contrast rate CTR.Results of simulation show that the proposed algorithm gives anenormous gain compared with the conventional TBD techniques.6542135, Poster SessionThe geometric design of microbolometer elements foruncooled focal plane arraysM. Russ, J. Bauer, H. Vogt, FraunhoferInstitut frMikroelektronische Schaltungen und Systeme GermanyIn this paper we discuss possibilities to improve the geometric designof microbolometer pixels in uncooled focal plane arrays. For costreduction reasons, the pixel pitch of these microbolometer elementsshould be reduced as much as possible while keeping the same level ofperformance. This becomes increasingly difficult once the dimensionsof the microbolometer elements reach a critical value of about 25micrometers, mainly because the available space limits the thermalisolation and the available area for IR absorbtion. For these reasons it isessential to optimise not only the material properties but also thegeometric aspects of the microbolometer structure to get the maximumperformance for a given size of the elements.Extending the work of Liddiard 1, in the first part of this paper wediscuss the design of the optical cavity, focussing mainly on theinfluence of the sacrificial layer thickness, which defines the propertiesof the resulting Fabry Perot resonator. In the second part of this paperwe concentrate on the geometry of the absorbing membrane itself andgive estimates for optimum film thicknesses and lateral dimensions.Finally, based on the resulting calculated values for the NETD noiseequivalent temperature difference, possibilites to further reduce thesize beyond a pixel pitch of 25 micrometers are reviewed.1 K.

P. HernndezRivera, O. M. PrimeraPedrozo, L. PachecoLondoo, N. RodrguezCardona, D. E. Nieves, Univ. de Puerto RicoMayagezWith heightened awareness of homeland security issues, the detection ofexplosives has become a pressing priority. Explosives detection is a veryimportant task for National Security. The formidable task includesdevelopment of new probes and methods for detection of concealedthreat compounds. Energetic compounds need to be detected on avariety of surfaces. Every surface will interact differently with the targetcompounds and the degree of adhesion will vary from surface to surface.Fiber Optic Coupled Grazing Angle Infrared Spectroscopy has been usedin our research group as a potential technique to develop newmethodologies for detection of explosives on surfaces. The technique isremote sensed, in situ and can detect nanograms of the compounds.Sample smearing, direct pipette transfer, thermal inkjet TIJ technology,among others are used for transferring the target analyte on thesubstrates to be used as standards and samples. In this researchsmearing was used as a sample transfer method. One of the mostrelevant areas of investigation is to analyze 2,4,6trinitrotoluene TNT onvarious non traditional surfaces such as plastics and glasses. Anotherimportant aspect of the research was to optimize the procedure wheremore reproducible spectra could be obtained and a better datapreprocessing protocol could be achieved. For non traditional surfaces,the analysis can be influenced by the distance between the grazing angleprobe and the sample plate. A series of statistical methods can be usedfor quantification of TNT dissolved in dichloromethane on plasticsurfaces. Among these the preferred are integration of band areas andPartial Least Squares PLS analysis. Partial least squares PLSregression is an extension of the multiple linear regression models. Byusing peak areas in the range from 1380 to 1273 cm1, the method wasnot linear for loading concentration higher than 5.0 gcm2. The loadingconcentration of 0.62  gcm2 was considered as limit of quantificationand 0.16   gcm2 as limit of detection.In this work the first method for detection and quantification ofexplosives on plastic surfaces using Fiber Optic Coupled Grazing AngleProbeFTIR sample and smearing on surface as transfer method wasevaluated as a proof of concept experiment. This methodology can alsobe used on others surfaces such as glass surfaces. The methodpromises to be an excellent methodology in areas of National Defenseand Security for contamination detection.

Eppeldauer, H. W. Yoon, National Institute of Standards andTechnologyShort wave infrared SWIR radiometers have been developed to extendthe NIST reference responsivity scales from the silicon wavelengthrange to 2500 nm. In addition to spectral power responsivitymeasurements, where 5 mm diameter InGaAs and extendedInGaAsEIGA detectors are underfilled by the incident radiation, irradianceresponsivity calibrations were needed. Irradiance measuringradiometers are used as reference detectors to calibrate fieldradiometers in both irradiance and radiance measurement modes. Inirradiance mode, smaller detectors with high shunt resistance, such as1 mm diameter shortwave HgCdTe and EIGA detectors were used.Mechanical, optical, thermal, and electronic design considerations ofSWIR radiometers are discussed in this paper. Noise equivalentcurrents and peak responsivities were measured to evaluate noiseequivalent power NEP.To convert power responsivity into irradiance responsivity, an integratingsphere diffuser is mounted between a precision input aperture and thedetector. For irradiance mode measurements, usually transmittingdiffusers are used between the aperture and the detector.  All of ourSWIR detectors are temperature controlled with 4stage thermoelectriccoolers to obtain high detector shunt resistances. The dissipated heat isremoved by either a fan or using circulated water from a fan cooledradiator unit. The detector temperature is stabilized with a temperaturecontroller to about 80 oC using a thermistor sensor. As a result of theshort wavelength cutoff and the high detector shunt resistance, thebackground produced noise could be equalized to the output noise ofthe detectorpreamplifier unit. The shunt resistance dominated resistornoise at the highest signalgain selections was equalized to the low 1fnoise from the selected operational amplifiers at the output of thepreamplifier. The operational amplifiers with high openloop gain andlarge unitygain bandwidth were selected to perform low uncertaintycurrenttovoltage conversion even at high signal gains andfrequencies. The signal chopping frequencies were tuned to the elbowof the 1f noise spectrum. Optimization of the preamplifier gaincharacteristics was necessary to measure chopped radiation with highsensitivity and low measurement uncertainty. Typically, thephotocurrenttovoltage conversion uncertainty is 0.02  k2. Theresponsivity calibration results are reported at DC zero Hz. To obtainexact decade ratios for the different signal gain selections at a givenother than DC signal frequency, the frequency dependent gainresponsivity curves were measured and then corrections were appliedbased on the measured data.6542139, Poster SessionCharacterization of layer of Tetryl, TNB, and HMX usinggrazing angleFTIRS.

Crastes, J. Tissot, ULIS FranceNETD is often the only available parameter to characterize uncooledFPAs. However NETD is strongly dependant on thermal time constant.Therefore, this paper deals with the important parameters like MTF, fillfactor and thermal time constant, to compare microbolometer devicesand proposes a figure of merit taking into account thermal sensitivity aswell as imager characterization. For example, a FPA with a NETDaround 10 mK and thermal time constant around 40 ms is obviously notcompliant with a 100 Hz frame rate and has to be compared with a 40mK, 10ms component.The important point is to define the right figure of merit FOM tocompare different FPAs and to make the best choice for a givenapplication. A dynamic approach is therefore proposed to be as closeas possible to the real life and compared to the static approachgenerally used in simulation software.6542141, Poster SessionDualband camera system with advanced imageprocessing capabilityO.

A. Vaitekunas, W. R. Davis Engineering, Ltd. CanadaModeling the bidirectional reflectance distribution function or BRDF ofa ship surface is an integral part of any infrared ship signature model.The ship surface BRDF within ShipIR is based on the SandfordRobertson 1965 model with a discrete assumption for lobewidth andsolarglint.  The sea surface reflectance model within ShipIR is based ona sea roughness probability density function or PDF as formulated byCox and Munk 1954 but uses a more refined integral approach, asoutlined by Mermelstein et al. 1994, to compute the solarglint andnonglint reflections of the sea and sky.  A similar roughness model wasproposed by Ward 1992 to characterize the BRDF properties of atypical surface paint based on isotropic and anisotropic assumptions ofsurface roughness.  This paper compares the two surface roughnessmodels to show that BRDF sr1 is not an ideal parameter for thecalculation of a microfaceted surface reflectance.

Only by knowing atmospheric transmissionprecisely enough, we will be able to eliminate effects of the atmosphereon test results. For this reason a new instrument that measures opticaltransmission in the atmosphere has been constructed. Thetransmissometer consists of a transmitterreceiver unit, a reflector andcontrol software. The instrument measures atmospheric transmission atwavelength of 1 m and 812 m by comparing the intensity of thebeam propagating through the atmosphere and the reference beaminside the transmitterreceiver unit. Calibration is carried out by the aidof a visibility meter and a special calibration algorithm. An importantcriterion for the design was to create an instrument which could beused flexibly in field measurements.

Themotivation for this model arose from a need for analysis tools to supportthe design and evaluation of future military night vision systems. Basedon this requirement, this research focused primarily on radiancecomputations for the visible to shortwave infrared spectral region. Themodel predicts expected irradiance levels for tactical operations in avariety of scenarios spanning urban to rural conditions and for variousnight sky conditions, e.g., , full moon, cloudy sky conditions, etc..

These techniques correct for diffraction blur and otherfactors that degrade the highfrequency content of imagery. In somecases, the target acquisition range of stateoftheart thermal imagers isincreased by 70 per cent.

A. Hogervorst, J. Beintema, A.

Hence, there isan increasing need for methods to quantify the operationaleffectiveness of dynamic imaging. Until now, empirical dynamic TA fielddata is lacking and all estimates of image enhancement effectivenessare either based on TA model calculations or on measurements usingabstract test targets e.g. the TOD triangle test pattern. In this study, werecorded static and dynamic IR imagery of small handheld military andcivilian objects at a range of distances, and applied several types ofsignal processing techniques to the imagery. In an observer experiment,we determined identification performance as a function of target rangefor static, dynamic and enhanced imagery. The results are in closeagreement with the TOD data collected in earlier studies. In conclusion,the data support the TOD as an endtoend measure that quantifiesdynamic image quality. In addition, the data set may be used to validateor improve dynamic imaging performance predictions of current TAmodels.654312, Session 3Avoiding and mitigating cell imbalance in tankidentification perception testsR. K. Moore, E. L. Jacobs, C. E. Halford, The Univ. of MemphisCorrections are given for cell imbalance in the design and analysis oftwelvetarget tracked vehicle identification perception tests.  Such testsare an important tool in the development of the NVESD model of humanobserver performance that is used in NVThermIP to compare electrooptical systems.  It is shown that the partitions of the twelvetarget setthat have been previously used in perception experiments exhibit astatistically significant amount of cell imbalance according to observerresults.  Results from perception testing are used to determine therelative difficulty of identifying different images in the set.  A program ispresented to partition the twelve target set into lists that are balancedaccording to the collected observer data.  This will allow perception testdesigners to decrease the possibility that cell imbalance will corrupttheir test results.  The relative difficulty of image subsets is shown to berelated to the bestfit V50 values for the subsets.  The results of pastperception experiments are adjusted to account for cell imbalanceusing the subset V50 terms.  The adjusted results are shown to betterfollow the TTP model for observer performance.  When the properconditions are met, the correlation to the model increases and the meansquared error decreases.654313, Session 3Superresolution reconstruction and local areaprocessing performanceG. C.

Performance is measured as a function of thenumber of video frames per second, imager spatial resolution and theability of the observer to accurately determine the destination of amoving human target. The research is restricted to data and imagerycollected from altitudes typical of modern low to mid altitude persistentsurveillance platforms using a wide field of view.

P. Lam, Thales Raytheon SystemsSome image processing techniques require input images to beadequate in image quality in order to be used.  Image quality metricsare needed to determine whether an input image can be used.  Oneform of image quality is sharpness.  The image sharpness metric isbased on a observation of image edges.  The described approach is areference metric, meaning that the quality measure is a relative scoredependent on image frames.  This metric is designed for evaluation ofinput images that are obtained from a relatively same observation angle.We used the image edges because they are greatly affected by imagecorruption, such as motion blur and video deinterlacing artifacts.  Edgesare extracted to create edge maps.  The edge pixels from the edgemaps are summed, which is called the score.  Lower scores correspondto the sharper images.  The scores are directly related to the number ofedge pixels.  In relatively unsharp image, the number of edge pixels areincreased, because of motion blur, and focus blur.  We found that themetric corresponds well with subjective testing and is therefore suitablefor quick qualitative characterization of sharpness.It was discovered that the size of the filter is important for evaluating thequality of the deinterlaced frame.  If deinterlaced frame consists of Nfields at fields, then the filter size must be at least N1.  For example, ifthere are even and odd fields N2, then the filter size must be at least3.  The reasoning for filter size is that the filter needs to span enoughvideo lines to properly evaluate interlace jitter.  In the even and odd fieldvideo system, the filter must span the deinterlaced outputs two evenlines and one odd line, or vice versa.This metric is used in a system loop where feedback the describedmetric is used to evaluate quality for realtime image processingapplications.  Because time critical restrictions are in placed, one mustalso consider the filter size and filter implementation as well.  The largerthe filter size, the higher the number of floating point multiplications.Therefore, the implementation can involve the use of simple additionsand bit shifts for multiplications of numbers in powers of two to reducefloating point operations.  Even with the implementation in integermathematics, the filter size criteria still needs to be met.  Since thequality metric is a relative metric, a human in the loop is needed tothreshold frames that are unacceptable.  The human in the loopchooses the initial threshold.  From the initial point the metric iscompared with the threshold, which automatically determines if an inputimage is acceptable or not for use in an image processing application.In this paper, we present a metric that evaluates image sharpness.654318, Session 4Sine wave contrast target for direct view optics fieldperformance measurementsK.

K. Moore, C. L. Howell, E. L. Jacobs, C. E. Halford, The Univ. ofMemphisA perception test determined which of several image fusion metricsbest predicts relative observer preference.  Many fusion techniques andfusion metrics have been proposed, but there is a need to relate themto a human observers measure of image quality.  LWIR and MWIRimages were fused using techniques based on the DWT, the shiftinvariant DWT, Gabor filters, pixel averaging, and principal componentanalysis.  Two different sets of fused images were generated from urbanscenes.  The quality of the fused images was then measured using themutual information metric, fusion quality index, edgedependent fusionquality index, weightedfusion quality index, and the meansquarederrors between the fused and source images.  A pairedcomparisonperception test determined how observers rated the relative quality ofthe fused images.  The observers based their decisions on thenoticeable presence or absence of information, blur, and distortion inthe images.  The observer preferences were then correlated with thefusion metric outputs to see which metric best represents observerpreference.  The results of the paired comparison test show that themutual information metric most consistently correlates well with themeasured observer preferences.654321, Session 5The impact of atmospheric path radiance on MWIR andLWIR sensor performanceV. A. Hodgkin, U.S. Army Night Vision  Electronic SensorsDirectorate C. E. Halford, The Univ. of Memphis T. Maurer, U.S.Army Night Vision  Electronic Sensors DirectorateAtmospheric path radiance between scene and sensor occurs in boththe MWIR and LWIR as a consequence of thermal radiation by thegases and other constituents in the atmosphere and scattering of otherthermal sources.  In thermal IR imagery, it can  reduce the apparentcontrast of targets at long range.  For ground based imaging sensors,this effect occurs primarily in the wide field of view WFOV where thesensor gain and level are determined by the contrast of closer targetsand backgrounds.  In WFOV imagery, as the ground approaches thehorizon, high path radiance adds into the average flux of the signal andmasks distant targets in the detection process.  However, in the narrowFOV, an apparent targettobackground contrast reduction is less likelyto occur in the identification ID process since in the NFOV the targetand background will be at about the same range and thus have thesame path radiance.  The gain and level of the sensor can be adjustedsuch that path radiance in both target and background is subtractedfrom the image.  This paper examines the potential impact of pathradiance on notional dual band thermal imaging systems 3rd GenFLIR, both phenomenological and sensor performance, usingMODTRAN and NVThermIP.654322, Session 5A new optical flow estimation method in joint EOIRvisual surveillanceH. Man, J. Wang, R. Martini, Stevens Institute of Technology R. J.Holt, Queensborough Community CollegeCUNY R. Netravali, I.Mukherjee, Stevens Institute of TechnologyElectroOptical EO and InfraRed IR sensors have been jointlydeployed in many surveillance systems. In this work we study thespecial characteristics of optical flow in IR imagery, and introduce anoptical flow estimation method using coregistered EO and IR imageframes. The basic optical flow calculation is based on the combinedlocal and global CLG method Bruhn, Weickert and Schnorr, 2002,which seeks solutions that simultaneously satisfy a local averagedbrightness consistency constraint and a global flow smooth constraint.While CLG method can be directly applied to IR image frames, theestimated optical flow fields usually manifest high level of randommotions caused by thermal noise. Furthermore, IR sensors operating atdifferent wavelengths, e.g. meddlewave infrared MWIR and longwaveinfrared LWIR, may yield inconsistent motions in optical flowestimation. Because of the availability of both EO and IR sensors inmany practical scenarios, we propose to estimate optical flow jointlyusing both EO and IR image frames. This method is able to takeadvantage of the complementary information offered by these twoimaging modalities. The joint optical flow calculation fuses the motionfields from EO and IR images using a nonlinear spatial correlationmodel which aligns the estimated motions based on neighbor activities.Experiments performed on the OTCBVS dataset and the Stevensdataset demonstrated that the proposed approach can effectivelyeliminate many unimportant motions, such as moving shadows andobject reflections etc, and significantly reduce erroneous motions, suchas sensor noise. The full description of the proposed method and thecomplete experimental results will be presented in the final paper.654323, Session 5Effects of scenebased nonuniformity correctionalgorithms on observer performanceS. M. Salem, C. E. Halford, The Univ. of MemphisIn this paper we will present the effects of image degradations causedby scenebased nonuniformity correction techniques on observerperformance. Focal plane arrays suffer from fixed pattern noise.Algorithms attempting to correct this noise are either reference based orscene based. Reference based methods produce radiometricallycorrect outputs, but require halting the cameras operation. Scenebased techniques, by contrast, can be incorporated into the datacapturing process, either with a software or a hardware implementation.Scene based algorithms are therefore gaining popularity over referencebased ones. Scene based algorithms suffer from an inherent loss ofinformation caused by the assumptions the algorithm is built on. Forexample, predicting a pixel value by averaging neighboring pixels isequivalent to lowpass filtering. Image degradation become moreprominent if the assumptions are not met. For example, an algorithmthat requires camera motion will not perform well if the camera is still forextended periods of time. In this paper we will establish the effects ofthree different scenarios on observer performance. First, the algorithmassumptions degrade image information that may be important.Second, the algorithm assumptions are not strictly met. Third, thealgorithm assumptions are completely violated. For every scenarioobserver performance will be recorded hereby establishing arelationship between observer performance and algorithm behavior.654324, Session 6Correlation between human observer performance andthe number of spatial, thermal, and total cues in LWIRimageryM. A. Brickell, The Univ. of Memphis T. C. Edwards, U.S. ArmyRedstone Technical Test Ctr. C. E. Halford, The Univ. of MemphisK. M. Dennen, ERC, Inc.A human perception test has been conducted to determine thecorrelation between observer response and the number of thermal,spatial, and total cues in an image.  Our experiment used the NVESD 12target longwave infrared tracked vehicle image set.  Various levels ofGaussian blur were applied to twelve aspects of the twelve targets inorder to reduce both the number of resolvable cycles and the number ofvisible thermal and spatial cues.  We then counted every observablethermal and spatial cue in each of the processed images.  A thermalcue was defined as either a hot spot or a cool spot.  Typically, hot spotsare produced by a vehicles engine or exhaust.  Cool spots are featuressuch as air intakes and trim vanes.  Spatial cues includedcharacteristics such as barrel length, turret size, turret shape, number ofwheels, and cupola location.  The results of a 12 alternative forcedchoice identification perception test were analyzed to determine thecorrelation between probability of identification and the number ofthermal, spatial, and total cues.  The results show that spatial cues arefavored over thermal cues.Conf. 6543 Infrared Imaging Systems Design, Analysis, Modeling,and Testing XVIII76 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654325, Session 6Silhouette and background information analysisM. N. Moore, J. D. OConnor, U.S. Army Night Vision  ElectronicSensors DirectoratePerception testing was performed to determine the amount ofinformation that could be obtained from a targets silhouette.Experiments were performed using original imagery, silhouette imagery,background imagery, and target imagery.  The original imageryconsisted of both the original background and target signatures.  Thesilhouette imagery was comprised of a uniform background with atemperature approximately equal to the average backgroundtemperature and a uniform target with a temperature equal to the rootsum of squares delta T.  The background imagery included the originalbackground signature with a uniform target having a temperature equalto the root sum of squares delta T.  The target imagery consisted of theoriginal target signature with a uniform background having atemperature equal to the average background temperature. An 8 targetset was used with varying levels of Gaussian blur and down samplingrates applied to each target.  All targets were viewed at 3 differentaspects and in the infrared IR spectra.  Observer results show highertarget identification scores for silhouette imagery, at higher blur levels,than original imagery.  However, target identification ID scores weresignificantly lower for background imagery than original imagery.  Targetidentification results for target imagery exhibited better scores than theoriginal imagery.654326, Session 6Quantitative analysis of infrared contrast enhancementalgorithmsS. WeithGlushko, C. Salvaggio, Rochester Institute of TechnologyDynamic range reduction and contrast enhancement are two imageprocessing methods that are required when developing thermal camerasystems. The two methods must be performed in such a way that thehigh dynamic range imagery output from todays sensors arecompressed in a pleasing way for display on lower dynamic rangemonitors. This research examines a quantitative analysis of infraredcontrast enhancement algorithms found in literature and developed bythe author. Four algorithms were studied, three of which were found inliterature and one developed by the author tailless plateau equalizationTPE, adaptive plateau equalization APE, the method according toAare Mallo MEAM, and infrared multiscale retinex IMSR. TPE andAPE are histogram based methods, requiring the calculation of thedistribution of digital counts within an image. MEAM and IMSR arefrequency based methods, methods which operate on input imagerythat has been split into imagery containing differing spatial frequencycontent. After a rate of growth analysis and psychophysical trial wasperformed, histogram based methods for infrared contrastenhancement was found to be the best in deference to frequency basedmethods. Since then, further research has been performed to developfrequency based contrast enhancement algorithms.654327, Session 6Active imaging system performance model for targetacquisitionR. L.

H.Tofsted, Army Research Lab.The U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision  Electronic SensorsDirectorate has developed a laserrangegated imaging systemperformance model for the detection, recognition, and identification ofvehicle targets.  The model is based on the established US ArmyRDECOM CERDEC NVESD sensor performance models of the humansystem response through an imaging system.  The Javabased model,called NVLRG, accounts for the effect of active illumination,atmospheric attenuation, and turbulence effects relevant to LRGimagers, such as speckle and scintillation, and for the critical sensorand display components.  This model can be used to assess theperformance of recently proposed active SWIR systems through varioustrade studies.

By changing the scene contrast temperature input, thesystem gain can be modified to reflect varying contrast levels.  In thispaper, the results for two experiments dealing with task difficulty forseveral gain levels are reviewed.  Strategies for optimizing the scenecontrast temperature based upon scene dynamics are presented.Using these strategies, the scene contrast temperature parameter canbe scaled for search and identification tasks to provide a more accuraterepresentation of field performance of thermal imagers.

Application of such enhancement to stereo analysis forvisible band cameras has shown promising results in the past. It furtherneeds to be expanded to infrared band for a daynight operationalcapability, and in particular the performance of uncooled infraredsensors needs to be quantified. In this report, the resolutionenhancement effect on disparity estimation is examined empiricallyusing an uncooled low resolution infrared camera, and the results areanalyzed with respect to the high resolution cameras. Currentlyavailable resolution enhancement algorithms including Maximum APosteriori MAPbased and Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMCbasedalgorithm are utilized, and the variance of disparity estimate isexamined as a function of algorithm parameters, targettobackgroundtemperature difference, 3D Noise, and baseline distance. A metric isapplied to evaluate the disparity estimation results, and an empiricalmodel for the performance gain is designed.654333, Session 7Field performance of sensors using superresolutionJ. D.

Mller, Fraunhofer Institut fr Informations undDatenverarbeitung Germany O. Schreer, M. Lpez Senz, IRCAMGmbH GermanyA dualband infrared camera system based on a dualband quantumwell infrared photodetector QWIP has been developed for acquiringimages from both the midwavelength MWIR and longwavelengthLWIR infrared spectral band. The system delivers exactly pixelregistered simultaneously acquired images. It has the advantage thatappropriate signal and image processing permit to exploit differences inthe characteristics of those bands. Thus, the camera reveals moreinformation than a singleband camera. It helps distinguishing betweentargets and decoys and has the ability to defeat many IRcountermeasures such as smoke, camouflage and flares. Furthermorethe system permits to identify materials e.g. glass, asphalt, slate, etc.,to distinguish sun reflections from hot objects and to visualize hotexhaust gases.Furthermore, dedicated software for processing and exploitation in realtime extends the application domain of the camera system. Onecomponent corrects the images and allows for overlays withcomplementary colors such that differences become apparent. Anothersoftware component aims at a robust estimation of transformationparameters of consecutive images in the image stream for imageregistration purposes. This feature stabilizes the images also underrugged conditions and it allows for the automatic stitching of the imagestream to construct large mosaic images. Mosaic images facilitate theinspection of large objects and scenarios and create a better overviewfor human observers. In addition, image based MTI moving targetindication also for the case of a moving camera is under development.This component aims at surveillance applications and could also beused for camouflage assessment of moving targets.654335, Session 8Broadband optical test bench OPTISHOP to measureMTF and transmittance of visible and IR opticalcomponentsD.

IsraelCI Systems has developed a new cost effective and modular OpticalTest Bench to measure MTF and transmittance of optical componentsin the VisibleNear Infrared 0.41.7 microns and infrared 3 to 12microns spectral ranges.The optical design concept of the system allows the user to switch fromMTF on and offaxis to lens transmittance measurements, withoutneed of optical alignment by the user. In addition, broad band sourcesare used, so that these optical properties can be measured in the wholerelevant wavelength range of the components to be tested.Other lens measurements such as effective focal length, back focallength, distortion and field curvature can be made.The system is based on the standard and proven CTS Collimator TestSystem product line of CI, which is made of reflective optics for widewavelength coverage, and it is ruggedly built for use in the laboratory,production line or maintenance depot. An advantage of the CTSconfiguration is that the sourcecollimator assembly is enclosed in arobust mechanical envelope, which prevents accidental misalignementsand breakage, optical misalignments due to environment temperaturedrifts, soiling of the optics, and easier system transportation.The system will be described, including calibration and validationtechniques.Conf. 6543 Infrared Imaging Systems Design, Analysis, Modeling,and Testing XVIII78 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654336, Session 8Detector spatial response testing of LWIR FPAsK. A. Lindahl, W. Burmester, K. Whiteaker, E. E. Penniman, P. B.Johnson, R. Banks, Ball Aerospace  Technologies Corp.The spatial response of IR FPA is an important attribute of imagequality.  A novel test system for determining detector MTF has beendeveloped for use on LWIR FPAs.  Total system MTF is measuredthrough movement of the spot across the FPA, with centroidingtechniques applied to account for any FPA nonuniformity.  Optics MTFis measured by moving the optical relay through focus with themanipulator and applying phase retrieval methods.  The Optics MTF isthen removed from the measured system MTR to produce the detectorMTF.  The technique has been applied to large area LWIR FPAs, andresult are compared to theoretical predictions.The system consists of a fast F1 Optical Relay designed to image apinhole illuminated by a blackbody onto a focal plane array FPA.  TheF1 Optical Relay is composed of a three reflective elements whichinclude two Off Axis Parabolas OAPs and a fold mirror. The opticalrelay has been designed with diffraction limited performance andaligned using cryogenic double pass interferometer tests.    MeasuredZernike Coefficients verified relay performance enabling cryogenicoperation at 77K in vacuum dewar over a the wavelength range of 3mto 15m.  Movement of the imaged spot across the FPA is achieved bymoving the optical relay with a three axis vacuum manipulator.  Theprecision manipulator has 0.0001 inch least count and 0.00005 inchrepeatability, enabling very accurate and repeatable placement of theimaged spot on the FPA surface.654337, Session 8Automated testing of ultraviolet, visible, and infraredsensors using shared opticsJ. A. Mazzetta, S. D. Scopatz, Electro Optical Industries, Inc.Complex systems ranging from unmanned vehicles to night visiongoggles rely on a various spectral regions to achieve the demandingimaging performance they require. The lines between infrared, visible,and ultraviolet are quickly blurring as multisensor systems becomemore sophisticated and image fusion becomes commonplace.Typically sensor testing requires hardware and software exclusivelydesigned for the spectral region of interest. Thus a system withultraviolet through infrared imaging capabilities could require up to threeseparate test benches for sensor characterization. This not only drivesup the cost of testing but also leads to a discontinuity of methods andpossibly skewed results.This paper will discuss hardware and software developed by theauthors that utilize identical test methods and shared optics tocomplete infrared, visible, and ultraviolet sensor performance analysis.Challenges encompassing multiple source switching, splitting, andcombining will be addressed along with decisions related to specifyingoptics and targets of sufficient quality and construction to provideperformance to cover the full spectral region.

Examples ofresults obtained by these test systems will be presented.654339, Session 9An advance in infrared lens characterizationmeasurement of the lens modulation transfer functionusing common undersampled IR systemsC. A. Nichols, StingRay Optics, LLC P. T. Bryant, Left CoastConsulting C. C. Alexay, StingRay Optics, LLCThe modulation transfer function MTF measurement has been a stapleof optics testing for many years.  Obtaining a highly accuratemeasurement of the MTF of a lens, however, has always been achallenge for a number of reasons.  Traditional MTF tests give ameasure of overall system performance, not individual parts such as thelens.  Also, the theoretical performance of the optics generally outstripsFPAcamera performance by a wide margin.  This typically requiresintricate hardware setups to quantify lens performance, such asspecialized singledetector systems.  These systems, however, are verydifficult to use, have few other applications, and are quite expensive.This paper will describe an improved technique for measuring opticalquality of infrared systems, as well as preliminary research regardingindividual component i.e.  lens MTF.  In particular, the methodologypresented will expand upon the traditional tilted slit technique anddemonstrate an improved test capability for characterization of MTF andother optical UUT performance parameters.  We will describe amethodology which uses Gaussian energy profiling and novel collectionoptics to deliver an MTF measurement capability with resolution andusability superior to that of single point measurement techniques.  Thepaper will also discuss the optical system requirements and mathematicalalgorithms required to provide a fast, accurate, and highresolution FFTMTF capability, and support for a range of other optical UUTcharacterization modes.654340, Session 9Radiometric calibration of infrared target projectorsystems in uncontrolled environmentsG.

Sanderson, J. F. McCalmont, Air Force Research Lab. J. B.Montgomery, MM Aviation R. Johnson, MacAulayBrown, Inc. D.McDermott, Air Force Research Lab.A new tactical airborne multicolor missile warning testbed wasdeveloped and fielded as part of an Air Force Research LaboratoryAFRL initiative focusing on clutter and missile signature measurementsfor algorithm development.  Multicolor discrimination is one of the mosteffective ways of improving the performance of infrared missile warningsensors, particularly for heavy clutter situations.  Its utility has beendemonstrated in multiple fielded sensors.  Traditionally, multicolordiscrimination has been performed in the midinfrared, 35 m band,where the molecular emission of CO and CO2 characteristic of acombustion process is readily distinguished from the continuum of ablack body radiator.  Current infrared warning sensor development isfocused on VNIR staring mosaic detector arrays that provide similarspectral discrimination in different bands to provide a cost effective andmechanically simpler system.  This, in turn, has required that multicolorclutter data be collected for both analysis and algorithm development.The developed sensor test bed is a multicamera system 1004x1004FPA coupled with optimized  filters integrated with the optics.  Thecollection portion includes a ruggedized fieldprogrammable gate arrayprocessor coupled with with an integrated controllertracker and fastdisk array capable of realtime processing and collection of up to 60 fullframes per second.  This configuration allowed the collection and realtime processing of temporally correlated, radiometrically calibrated datain multiple spectral bands that was then compared to background andtarget imagery taken previously.654346, Session 9Design of a compact allrefractive doublepass MWIR LWIR hyperspectral imagerT.

Thetechnique uses two adaptive thresholds one is tuned for optimumprobability of detection, the other  to manage required false alarm rate,and with integration process placed right between those twothresholds. This configuration allows a nonlinear integration processthat, along with SignaltoNoise Ratio SNR gain and data reductionprovides system designers more capability where cost, weight, orpower considerations limit system data rate, processing, or memory.Adding the third threshold can transform a system with RecursiveAdaptive Frame Integration into real time operational system.  However,performance of Recursive Adaptive Frame Integration of Limited Datamay fall short when singleframe SNR is really low. In this paper theRecursive Adaptive Frame Integration of Limited Data is presented inform of multiple parallel recursive integration that is when combinedwith other elements of FPA video processing  correlation filtering,adaptive offset correction and gain term control. Such an approach canhelp to  manage required probability of detection with reduced data ratewhen single frame SNR is quite low and to manage real time operationas well.654348, Session 9Laser dazzling of focal plane array camerasR.

Park, ChungAng Univ. South KoreaHuman biometric characteristics are unique, so it can hardly beduplicated 1, 2. Such information includes facial, speech, hands,body, and gesture to name a few. Face detection and recognitiontechniques are proven to be more popular than other biometric featuresbased on efficiency and convenience 3, 4. It can also use a lowcostpersonal computer PC camera instead of expensive equipments, andrequire minimal user interface. Face authentication has become apotential a research field related to face recognition. Face recognitiondiffers from face authentication because the former has to determinethe identity of an object, while the latter needs to verify the claimedidentity of a user. Speech 5 is one of the basic communications, whichis better than other methods in the sense of efficiency and convenience.Each a single biometric information, however, has its own limitation. Forthis reason, we propose a multimodal biometric verification method toreduce false acceptance rate FAR and false rejection rate FRR in realtime.In this paper, we propose a personal verification method using bothface and speech to improve the rate of single biometric verification.False acceptance rate FAR and false rejection rate FRR have been afundamental bottleneck of realtime personal verification. The proposedmultimodal biometric method is to improve both verification rate andreliability in realtime by overcoming technical limitations of singlebiometric verification methods. The proposed method uses principalcomponent analysis PCA for face recognition and hidden markovmodel HMM for speech recognition based on stereo vision andinfrared system. It also uses fuzzy logic for the final decision of personalverification. Fig. 1 shows the result of registered personal verification.Based on experimental results, the proposed system can reduce FARdown to 0.0001, which provides that the proposed methodovercomes the limitation of single biometric system and provides stablepersonal verification in realtime.654354, Poster SessionNavy and Marine Corps utility of the 2  2.3 micronwavebandJ.

This paper describesthe results of a comprehensive study performed on two resistive arraytechnologies the Nuclear Optical Dynamic Display System NODDSand the Santa Barbara Infrared SBIR Mirage and LFRA product lines. AFourier Transform Interferometer FTIRbased radiometer was used tomeasure the spectral radiant emission of both resistive arraytechnologies at multiple drive levels and substrate temperatures.

Swierkowski, R. A. Joyce, O. M. Williams, Defence Science andTechnology Organisation AustraliaNonuniformity correction NUC has arguably been the most challengingactivity that has occupied the minds of resistor array infrared projectorresearchers over much of the past decade.  Progress has beenrelatively slow due to the conglomeration of effects that tend tocontaminate the nonuniformity measurement procedure.  Together,temporal noise, camera nonuniformities, camera drift, the large dynamicrange, optical distortion, mapping and registration errors, Moir fringesand subpixel effects all conspire to make projector NUC difficult.Fortunately, there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel, with thecameraassociated problems now largely tamed.  Indeed, the remainingproblems in the above list  all associated with the sampling of theprojected scene  now determine the challenge.  In this paper wedescribe our efforts to lower the defences of this nextlower level ofNUCcomplicating effects.  In particular, we emphasize the importanceof application of a precise mapping and registration algorithm togetherwith projection techniques that serve to separate the residualnonuniformity, Moir fringe and subpixel effects.  Results from ourlatest NUC procedures are presented, all leading towards our goal ofachieving high fidelity NUCs suitable for satisfying the demandingrequirements of both low dynamic range thermal imager simulationapplications and high dynamic range missile simulation applications.654403, Session 1LFRA developments in largeformat resistive arrays andadvanced IRSP system technologiesJ.

Gareri, Simulation Technologies, Inc.HardwareintheLoop HWIL test facilities offer the highest degree ofsystem functional verification and performance evaluation outside of thetarget systems actual operational environment.  The design andanalysis of HWIL simulators involves the coordinated efforts ofnumerous engineering fields, whose professionals possess thetechnical expertise, analytical skills, and insight regarding crossdiscipline collaborative relationships which foster successful simulationdevelopment.  As system complexity continues to increase, and asprogrammatic requirements allow for shorter simulation developmentschedules, the existing knowledge base associated with legacysimulation development will play a key role in the preparation,readiness, and efficiency of future HWIL engineering professionals. As aresult, it is crucial that basic HWIL methods and concepts bedocumented in a formal, academic sense, and that realistic test facilitiesare made available to allow potential HWIL engineering students theability to become acclimated to basic HWIL components and designconsiderations.To address this need, the United States Army Space and MissileDefense Command SMDC, in coordination with the Auburn UniversityDepartment of Aerospace Engineering, has funded an initiative toperform initial development of a graduatelevel HWIL simulation coursestructure, including the provision of a functioning HWIL simulationfacility located at the university.

No longer is it necessary to have access to a highendspecialist graphics computer.  Instead, all that is needed is a standardPC equipped with a GPUbased graphics card, the latter beingprogrammed through a standard Application Interface OpenGL orDirectX used in conjunction with a GPU shader language such as Cg.GPU infrared scene generation is now under routine use within theDSTO realtime infrared scene projection facility and is being continuallydeveloped as the need for greater scene complexity increases.

We highlight the underlying features of the GPU thathave been exploited to ensure high vertex and fragment throughputsand summarise the techniques that have allowed quite complex scenesto be generated in realtime.  Infrared radiometry is also addressed andwe show that apparent temperatures above background ranging from afew tens of mK to the suns temperature can be accommodated withoutrenormalisation, in spite of the limitation arising from the GPU internaluse of 16 bit floating point numbers.

C. Das, Army Research Lab. J. Kramer, F. Kimilev, Univ. ofDelawarePassive IR imaging and IR detector arrays for seekers now play a veryimportant role in missile defense operations and systems as well as forother DOD applications. The seeker testing requires large 2D array, highframe rate and large dynamic range IR sources. Several IR sources havebeen integrated into the hardware in the loop HWIL facility in the past,including a scanning laser array, resistive array and digital micro mirrordevices DMD 1. In an earlier paper 2 we have shown that MWIR LEDarray with interband cascade IC structure has emission powerequivalent to apparent black body temperature of 650 K and 1050 Kwhen operated at room and liquid nitrogen temperatures respectively. Inthis paper we present the design and fabrication procedure for largeformat 64x64 MWIR LED array with peak emission at 3.8 micron. The ICLED structure was grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a p and ntypeGaSb substrate.The ASIC is 9.5mm square with a 68x68 array of unit cell drivers thatwas fabricated in the 130nm IBM 8HP SiGe process.  The unit cellswere designed to source up to 100mA to the LED, be individuallyaddressable, and have analog drive and memory that can operate at a 1kHz array refresh rate.  Each unit cell contains a CMOS logic switch, acapacitor and a SiGe HBT driver.  The switch is controlled by row andcolumn select lines, which when activated charges the capacitor.  Thevoltage stored on the capacitor controls the output current from thedriver to the LED.  The cells have a 120 micron pitch. With a currentdensity of 5 mAmm for the copper interconnect, at most 10 of theLEDs can be driven at the full 100mA drive current.The LED array fabrication process starts with TiAu anode metal contactdeposition, followed by LED mesa etching by ICP dry etchingtechnique. Silicon nitride is deposited by PECVD technique followingwhich contact windows are opened and TiAu metal layers aredeposited for both top and bottom contacts. The wafer is diced and flipchip mounted on to a CMOS driver circuits.

It is a crowntype optical glass having refractiveindex at 587.5 nm nd1.4959 and Abbe number d59.2. This glassshows low dependence of refractive index on temperature dndt1061deg. Absorption coefficient in the near IR region is about 104 cm1.Glass can withstand multikilowatt laser beams. Nonlinear refractiveindex is the same as for fused silica. Laser damage threshold for 8 ns isabout 40 cm2. This glass becomes a photosensitive one by dopingwith silver and cerium. It demonstrates refractive index decrement afterexposure to UV radiation followed by thermal development is used forphase volume hologram recording. Spatial modulation of refractiveindex resulted from precipitation of nanocrystalline phase of sodiumfluoride. The main mechanism of refractive index decrement is aphotoelastic effect resulted from strong tensions generated in bothcrystalline and vitreous phases because of strong difference in theircoefficients of thermal expansion. Volume Bragg gratings recorded inthis glass, show extremely narrow spectral and angular selectivity andhave low losses combined with high tolerance to laser radiation. Thesegratings possess a unique ability to produce laser beamtransformations directly in angular space.

The glassdevelopment process built on both accumulated experience and theutilization of glass science principles, and the resultant new glassoffered superior laser properties in combination with improvements inphysical properties to enhance manufacturing yield.  Essentially in86 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssparallel, to meet both the schedule and cost targets of the NIF, acontinuous melting production line was also conceived, designed andoperated.  Prior to 1997, phosphate laser glasses were manufacturedby a discontinuous pot process with limited production rate andassociated high costs.  The continuous melting process met severaltechnical challenges, including producing glass with low residual watercontent and absence of inclusions which become damage sites whenused in the NIF laser system.654509, Session 3Nanocomposite optical ceramics for infrared windowsand domesT. S. Stefanik, R. Gentilman, P. K. Hogan, Raytheon Co.Currently available IR transparent materials typically exhibit a tradeoffbetween optical performance and mechanical strength. For instance,sapphire domes are very strong, but lack full transparency throughoutthe 35 micron midwave IR band. Yttria is fully transparent from 35microns, but lacks sufficient strength, hardness, and thermal shockresistance for the most demanding aerothermal applications. Missilesystem designers must limit system performance in order toaccommodate the shortcomings of available window and domematerials. Recent work in the area of nanocomposite ceramics mayproduce new materials that exhibit both excellent optical transparencyand high strength, opening the door to improved missile performance.The requirements for optical nanocomposite ceramics will be presentedand recent work in producing such materials will be discussed.654510, Session 3Optical nanocomposites with novel architectureD.

Kostelecky, SynkeraTechnologies, Inc.This talk will overview the results of the development of a newnanostructured ceramic composite with innovative architecture.  Mainobjective of this effort is to achieve mechanical and thermal propertiesexceeding that of sapphire, while retaining optical performancecomparable to sapphire.  The composite incorporates a selforganizednanoporous ceramic matrix reinforced with nanostructured ceramic ofdifferent composition.  The intrinsic features of the proposed compositeallow the retention of sub50 nm grain size.  Processes used incomposite synthesis allow precision control of the composite structureand chemical composition, enabling advanced engineering ofcomposite properties and performance.  Results indicate thatcomposites synthesized to date have promising properties, and thatremoving residual absorption by OH bond is the key issue in achievingdesired optical performance.  Several processing routes that have beenidentified to address this challenge will be discussed.654511, Session 3Finegrain polycrystalline yttria for IR applicationsM. T. Koslowske, M. R. Pascucci, M. V. Parish, CeraNova Corp. W.H. Rhodes, Rhodes ConsultingCubic polycrystalline yttria has been made transparent in the visible byeliminating porosity and second phases while consolidating to fulldensity.  While this has been accomplished previously resulting in largegrain microstructures, renewed interest in this material for infrareddomes and windows centers on improved mechanical properties forincreased thermal shock resistance.  Reducing the grain size andimproving the surface finish are two possible approaches to improvingthe strength and reliability of this material.  Efforts to produce fine grain 10 m, dense and transparent yttria will be described.  Optical andmicrostructural properties of resulting materials will be presented.654512, Session 3Polycrystalline alumina for aerodynamic IR domesM. V. Parish, M. T. Koslowske, M. R. Pascucci, CeraNova Corp. W.H. Rhodes, Rhodes ConsultingCeraNovas transparent polycrystalline alumina has submicron grainsize 500700nm and high transmittance in the midwave infrared85 in the 35 m MWIR region.  The fine, uniform grain size alsoleads to high hardness, high strength, and high thermal shockresistance.  Polycrystalline alumina is a viable replacement for sapphiredomes, particularly for aerodynamic dome shapes which are readilyfabricated by powder processing.  Both hemispheric and ogive domeshave been successfully molded and densified to transparency.  Resultsof optical, mechanical, thermal shock, and rain impact testing will bepresented.654513, Session 3Polycrystalline yttrium aluminum garnet YAG for IRtransparent missile domes and windowsJ. C. Huie, Raytheon Co. C. B. Dudding, J. McCloy, RaytheonMissile SystemsCeramic YAG is being considered as an attractive material candidate forIR transparent missile domes and reconnaissance windows, due to itssuperior optical clarity and mechanical properties compared to theincumbent material choice. YAG possesses a very uniform index ofrefraction with minimal variation.  Its fracture strength, hardness, andtoughness also rank high among various other optically transparentmaterials and can be optimized further through grain size minimization.Ceramic YAG has been in development for several years at RaytheonAdvanced Materials Laboratory for laser gain and IR transparencyapplications. Recent advances in optical loss characterization andoptimization, scaleup efforts, and the fabrication of nonplanargeometries, such as hemispherical domes, will be presented.654549, Session 3Optically transparent polycrystalline Al2O3 window anddome produced by spark plasma sinteringD. Jiang, D. M. Hulbert, U. AnselmiTamburini, Univ. of CaliforniaDavis D. P. Land, Univ. of CaliforniaIrvine T. C. Ng, A. Muhkerjee,Univ. of CaliforniaDavisSpark plasmas sinteringSPS method was used to produce transparentalumina and proved to be a costeffective method due to shortprocessing cycle. It was found that realtively slower heating rate andlonger sintering time lead to higher IR transmittance. The transmittancevaries with grain size, on the other hand, even with similar grain size thetransmittance varied with SPS sintering parameters. Annealing in air at1250C for 24h significanly increased IR transmission. A maximumtransmittance of 85 has been successfully sintered at 1300C for5min. The present results are not consistent with RaleighGansDebyescattering model that predicts that the transmittance increases withdecreasing the grain size. The residual stress in the alumina grains maybe a fator influencing the optical transmission among other factors suchas stoichiometry, grain boundary, and nanoporosity.Utilizing SPS, transparent polycrystalline alumina dome has beensuccessfully produced by combining sintering and forming into onestep in minutes instead of hours when using conventional methods.This is a nearnetshape forming method such that minor amount ofmachining or polishing is needed. Obviously, the overall cost for makinga shaped part by using this method is drastically decreased. Thepresent forming method provides unprecedented opportunity to makeoptically transparent dome at much lower cost.Conf. 6545 Window and Dome Technologies and Materials X spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 87654515, Session 4Optical properties of Nddoped and undopedpolycrystalline YAGM.

Oguz, Johns Hopkins Applied PhysicsLab. W. F. Adler, Aquila Lab., LLC B. E. Moylan, U.S. Army Aviationand Missile Research, Development and Engineering Ctr.A physicsbased method is described for reliably predicting thedeformation of hydrometeors from first principles during encounters withsupersonic vehicles.  The results provided are for spherical water drops,but the significance of this method is its ability to describe thedeformation of water drops with arbitrary, asymmetric initial shapes aswell as other classes of hydrometeors.  Prior analyses developed for thisproblem area are restricted to spherical water drops.The results obtained from this method, currently being developed, areessential for evaluating the initial conditions for numerical models of thedamage missile airframes experience when deformed rain drops reach alocation on the surface of the vehicle.  Forward looking sensor windowsare particular locations of concern.  Previous work has shown that theshape of a rain drop at impact with the missile airframe is an importantfactor in the extent of the subsequent damage.  Therefore, thismethodology facilitates the prediction of the damage potential for a widerange flight and weather conditions.  A spherical drop subject to a normalshock will be considered to illustrate the general approach.  The resultsfrom the calculations compare favorably with the drop deformationsobserved during passage through the oblique bow shock for a streamlinedmissile at Mach 5.654518, Session 4BRDF and BSDF models for diffuse surface and bulkscatter from transparent windowsM. E. Thomas, D. D. Duncan, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.A novel approach based on the generalized Van CittertZernike theorem isused to characterize the scatter properties of window materials andcoated surfaces. The scattered light is categorized based on the level ofcoherence of the scattered light. A closed form model is applied to a widerange of illumination frequencies and material types. Diffuse scatteredlight is represented in a straightforward manner. Comparisons betweenmeasurements and model fits will be presented.654519, Session 4Application of nondestructive optical techniques in thedetection of surface and subsurface defects in sapphireI. Akwani, D. L. Hibbard, Exotic ElectroOptics, Inc.Advancements in optical manufacturing and testing technologies forsapphire material are required to support the increasing use of largeaperture sapphire panels as windscreens for various electroopticalsystem applications.  It is well known that the grinding and polishingoperations employed to create optical surfaces leads to the introductionof surface stress and subsurface damage which can affect criticaloptomechanical performance characteristics such as strength anddurability.  Traditional methods for measuring these defects aredestructive and, therefore, unsuitable as inprocess, high volumeinspection tools.  Work is presently underway at Exotic ElectroOpticsto investigate a number of nondestructive techniques forcharacterization of postfabrication stress and subsurface damage inaplane sapphire.  The ultimate goal is an inline, nondestructivemethodology capable of monitoring the stressstrength level directly inproduction panels on the shop floor.  Raman spectroscopy and laserpolarimetry have shown promise in quantifying surface and bulk stress,respectively.  Preliminary experimental results using these techniqueshave shown that stress and subsurface damage may be nondestructively measured and are dependent on the specific fabricationprocess steps used.  This report will also include a comparison of theresults of nondestructive testing to the results of an establisheddestructive technique to provide a measure of correlation.654520, Session 4Characterization AFBr sapphire single crystalcomposites for infrared windowsH. Lee, H. E. Meissner, Onyx Optics Inc.Nextgeneration weapons platforms may require sapphire windows ofabout 30x30.  Since these sizes exceed what can be manufactureddirectly, a concept is proposed and experimental data are furnished onthe viability of increasing the dimensions by AdhesiveFree BondingAFBr by their edges of smaller starting components in this report.The bonding scheme has been evaluated for single crystal sapphire butis expected to also describe other IR window materials.The bonding mechanism is explained with existing Van der Waalstheory of attractive forces and confirmed experimentally by applyingbending plate theory.  The gap at the interface between twocomponents is deduced from the measured roughness of the polishedsurfaces that are brought into optical contact and subsequently heattreated, and is estimated to be about 2  rms.  Stress relief at AFBrinterfaces has been established.  Experimental data and flexuralstrength determined by fourpoint bending at various environmental andthermal conditions will be reported and interpreted for AFBr compositespecimens and equivalently prepared blank samples understandardized testing conditions.  The transmitted wavefronts throughthe AFBr composite of various configurations are measuredinterferometrically  without and with applied loads.  Criticalrequirements for precision fabrication of composite AFBr sapphirewindows are addressed.654521, Session 4Simulation and experimental results of subaperturetransmitted wavefront measurements of a window usinga timedelayed sourceM. B. Dubin, Breault Research Organization, Inc. W. P. Kuhn,William P. Kuhn, Ph.D., LLCIt is often desirable to measure an optical component whose apertureexceeds the capacity of the measurement device.  However, stitching ofsubaperture measurement data into a single measurement of anoptical component is a challenging problem since mechanical motionsof the test component relative to the reference surface of aninterferometer can not be made with interferometric accuracy.  Evenmore challenging than the need to compensate for rigid body motionbetween the subaperture measurements is the need to account forimperfections in the reference surface itself.In this paper we show, both in simulation and experimentally, how theuse of a timedelayed source TDS simplifies the stitching oftransmitted wavefront measurements from domes and windows.  This isaccomplished by making it possible to obtain phaseshiftedConf. 6545 Window and Dome Technologies and Materials X88 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssinterferometric measurements using only the light reflected by twosurfaces from a dome or window without the use of a reference surface.654522, Session 5Noncontact aspheric, deep parabolic, ogivemeasurement systemD. E. Mohring, M. J. Bechtold, J. Meisenzahl, OptiPro SystemsOptiPro Systems is developing a noncontact measurement systemusing state of the art motion control and calibration techniques whileminimizing the axes of motion during measurement and integrating ahigh accuracy noncontact probe.The implementation of precision bearings for linear and rotary motion iscrucial for system repeatability and a variety of methods are explored.The goal is to precisely scan concave and convex surfaces of aspheric,deep parabolic and ogive shapes.  The metrology system will usecomputer controlled slicing techniques to create a single line scan anda complete topographical surface map of the surface form and alsotake surface roughness measurements above 30nm.  Analysis of themotion and calibration process with resultant measurements and errorbudgets will be presented.654523, Session 5Transmitted wavefront metrology of hemispheric domesusing a scanning lowcoherence dualinterferometrySLCDID. W. Diehl, C. Cotton, C. J. Ditchman, ASE Optics, Inc.Modern missile domes are up to 7 inches in diameter, subtending anangular aperture of 2 pi steradians. Quantifying the transmittedwavefront of these domes is critical for quality control, but such opticsare difficult or impossible to measure using conventional interferometrictechniques. To address this issue, we have developed  a noncontactmeasurement process that uses a technology similar to  opticalcoherence tomography OCT to map the optical thickness of ahemispheric dome over its full aperture. The technique has been termedScanning Low Coherence Dual Interferometry SLCDI, and has theunique ability to measure the optical thickness of component layerswithin a multilayer dome. In this paper we demonstrate that SLCDIyields results comparable to those from a Zygo interferometer within thelimits of the Zygos field of view. We also show that SLCDI is capable ofmeasuring decentration errors between the interior and exteriorsurfaces, which a standard interferometer may mistake for tiptilt ordefocus in the reference wavefront. From  this we conclude that SLCDIis a promising new tool for measuring the  quality of hemisphericdomes.654524, Session 5Timedelayed source and interferometric measurementof domes and windowsW. P. Kuhn, William P. Kuhn, Ph.D., LLC M. B. Dubin, BreaultResearch Organization, Inc.Measurement of the transmitted wavefront of domes and windows is alongstanding problem.  The use of a modern phaseshiftinginterferometer is problematic because of interference between theinterferometers reference surface and multiple reflections from thedome.  One may use a large return sphere and measure the interferencecavity without the dome present and again with the dome present.  Thedifference between the two measurements is measure of thetransmitted wavefront of the dome.  Even so, the long coherence lengthof the source results in many extraneous fringe patterns.  Windows maybe tested similarly with the use of a collimated source and return flat.In this paper we present a method of measuring the wavefront of adome or window using a timedelayed source TDS.  A singleinterference pattern due only to interference from the two surfaces of adome or window may be produced through the use of a shortcoherence length source and proper setting of the TDS timedelay.Standard phase shifting algorithms may be used to measure thetransmitted wavefront of a dome or window in a single measurementwhile errors from multiple path reflections are eliminated.  Since most ofthe interferometer is commonpath, environmental sensitivity is reducedand alignment is straightforward.  Finally, since there is no referencesurface, stitching of subaperture measurements is simplified.654525, Session 5Laserassisted prefinishing of optical ceramic materialsJ. C. Rozzi, O. H. Clavier, Creare Inc.At Creare, we are developing a laserassisted, prefinishing system thatenables the singlepoint diamond turning of superhard ceramics intohemispheres, ogives, and other shapes that are ready for final opticalfinishing.  Currently, superhard ceramic materials cannot be affordablyprocessed due to the low material removal rates and the high amount ofsubsurface damage associated with current processes.   Ourinnovation uses a lowpower, farinfrared laser to heat, but not ablate, athin layer of material prior to its removal.  By heating the ceramicmaterial, plasticlike deformation at the cutting edge is fostered by hightemperature dislocation motion.   In doing so, the cutting forces arereduced which enables attendant reductions in tool wear, surface andsubsurface damage, and processing time.  Our paper will summarizethe development of our innovation, describe the process, discuss themachine tool, and review the latest results including assessments ofsurface quality,  subsurface damage, cutting force measurements, andpart strength.654526, Session 5Developments in the finishing of domes and conformalopticsA. B. Shorey, W. Kordonski, J. Tracy, M. Tricard, QED TechnologiesInc.The final finish and characterization of windows and domes presents anumber of difficult challenges.  Furthermore, there is a desire toincorporate conformal shapes into next generation imaging andsurveillance systems to provide significant advantages in overallcomponent performance.  Unfortunately, their constantly changingcurvature and steep slopes make fabrication of such shapesincompatible with most conventional polishing and metrology solutions.Two novel types of polishing technology, Magnetorheological FinishingMRFr and Magnetorheological Jet MR Jettm, along with metrologyprovided by the Subaperture Stitching Interferometer SSIr haveseveral unique attributes that give them advantages in enhancingfabrication hemispherical domes and even conformal shapes.The advantages that MRF brings to the precision finishing of a widerange of shapes such as flats, spheres including hemispheres,cylinders, aspheres and even freeform optics, has been welldocumented.  The recently developed MR Jet process providesadditional benefits, particularly in the finishing the inside of steepconcave domes and other irregular shapes.  Combining thesetechnologies with metrology techniques, such as the SSI, provides asolution for finishing current and future windows and domes.  Recentexciting developments in the finishing of such shapes with thesetechnologies will be presented.  These include new advances such asthe ability to use the SSI to characterize a range of shapes such asdomes and aspheres, as well as progress in using MRF and MR Jet forfinishing conventional and conformal windows and domes.654527, Session 5Contact mechanics models and algorithms for domepolishing with UltraForm finishing UFFC. Bouvier, S. M. Gracewski, S. J. Burns, Univ. of RochesterUltraForm Finishing UFF is a new deterministic subaperture computernumerically controlled CNC polisher developed by OptiPro SystemsOntario, NY with the University of Rochester. UFF is designed, 1 to becompliant to reduce surface roughness and to remove midspatialConf. 6545 Window and Dome Technologies and Materials X spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 89frequency surface errors, especially cutter marks, 2 to be deterministicto preserve or correct the form of the part and, 3 to polish deep domesmade of tough, hard materials like aluminum oxynitride, ALON, orpolycrystalline alumina, PCA. Because UFF uses compliant tools withlarge contact patches, the depth of removal is prescribed by adjustingthe tool crossfeed velocity. The equations for the depth of removal asthe tool traverses an axisymmetric part were derived for flats andspheres. The form correction problem consists in solving theseequations by adjusting the tool crossfeed velocity to achieve a desiredremoval profile. The solution must satisfy constraints on the toolvelocity and acceleration. Solutions are achieved by treating theproblem as a constrained optimization after writing the depth of removalequations in matrix form for flats, spheres and aspheres. The solutionswere validated experimentally by comparing predicted and actualremoval profiles. The removal function or footprint of the tool, used toexpress the depth of removal, is evaluated by making a removal spot forone set of process parameters. Its variations, as a function of theprocess parameters, are predicted by using Hertz contact theory andthe Preston equation. To prevent toolpart collisions and to analyze partand spot measurements, algorithms were developed for the tool pathand evaluation of metrology inputs.654528, Session 5Improving surface figure and microroughness of IRmaterials and diamond turned surfaces with MagnetoRheological Finishing MRFrC. Supranowitz, C. Hall, P. Dumas, B. Hallock, QED TechnologiesInc.Optics manufactured for infrared IR applications are commonlyproduced using single point diamond turning SPDT.  SPDT canefficiently produce spherical and aspheric surfaces withmicroroughness and figure error that is often acceptable for use in thisregion of the spectrum.  The tool marks left by the diamond turningprocess cause high surface microroughness that can degradeperformance when used in the visible region of the spectrum.  Formultispectral and high precision IR applications, surface figure may alsoneed to be improved beyond the capabilities of the SPDT process.MagnetoRheological finishing MRFr is a deterministic, subaperturepolishing technology that has proven to be very successful atsimultaneously improving both surface microroughness and surfacefigure on spherical, aspheric, and most recently, freeform surfaces.MRF has been used on many diamond turned IR materials tosignificantly reduce surface microroughness from tens of nanometers tobelow 1 nm.  MRF has also been used to successfully correct figureerror on several IR materials that are not diamond turnable.This paper will show that the combination of SPDT and MRFtechnologies enable the manufacture of high precision surfaces on avariety of materials including calcium fluoride, silicon, and nickelplatedaluminum.  Results will be presented for microroughness reduction andsurface figure improvement, as well as for smoothing of diamondturning marks on an offaxis part.  Figure correction results using MRFwill also be presented for several other IR materials including sapphire,germanium, AMTIR, zinc sulfide, and polycrystalline alumina PCA.654529, Session 6Highdurability antireflection coatings for silicon andmultispectral ZnSS. Joseph, O. Marcovitch, Y. Yadin, D. Klaiman, N. Koren, H. Zipin,RAFAEL Armament Development Authority Ltd. IsraelIn the current complex battle field, military platforms are required tooperate on land, at sea and in the air in all weather conditions both dayand night. In order to achieve such capabilities, advanced electrooptical systems are being constantly developed and improved. Thesesystems such as missile seeker heads, reconnaissance and targetacquisition pods and tracking, monitoring and alert systems haveexternal optical components window or dome which must remainoperational even at extreme environmental conditions. Depending onthe intended use of the system, there are a few choices of window anddome materials. Amongst the more common materials one can pointout Sapphire, CVDZnS, multispectral ZnS, Germanium and Silicon.Other materials such as Spinel, ALON and Yittria may also beconsidered.To improve performance of such systems, radiation at any relevantwavelength must be permitted to pass through the window or dome.Most infrared materials have high indices of refraction and thereforethey reflect a large part of radiation. To minimize the reflection andincrease the transmission, antireflection AR coatings are the mostcommon choice. Since these systems operate at different environmentsand weather conditions, the coatings must be made durable towithstand these extreme conditions. In cases where the window ordome is made of relatively soft materials such as multispectral ZnS, thecoating may also serve as protection for the window or dome.In this work, several anti reflection coatings have been designed andmanufactured for 35m on Silicon. The coating materials used werechosen to be either oxides or fluorides which are known to have highdurability. Ellipsometry measurements were used to characterize thematerials and the measured optical constants were used for the coatingdesign. The effects of the deposition conditions on the opticalconstants of the deposited thin films and durability of the coatings willbe discussed. The coatings were tested according to MILSTD810Eand were also subjected to rain erosion tests at the University of DaytonResearch Institute UDRI whirling arm apparatus in which one of thecoatings showed no rain drop impact damage at all.Results of a multispectral antireflection coating on multispectral ZnSwill also be discussed. An attempt has been made to utilize a coatingthat will on one hand serve as a protective coating to reduce rainerosion damage and on the other hand to prolong  the use of multispectral ZnS components in a naval environment.654530, Session 6Durable optical coatings for windows and domesL.

This coating can be applied to the outsidesurface of moulded optics and windows and offers high spectralefficiencies from 2.0microns to 15microns.The ability to deposit a multilayer structure allows broad band highefficiency antireflection coatings.Compared to conventional DLC,thiscoating offers significantly less absorption, lower reflection,thusConf. 6545 Window and Dome Technologies and Materials X90 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssallowing higher transmission over a wider spectral band.Tests have shown that the coating offers exceptional resistance toabrasion,salt spray and humidity on both GASIRr and Germanium.The process used to manufacture iDLC has been configured forproduction volumes and offers a process for a wide range ofapplications on IR electrooptic materials.654532, Session 6Eclipse IRTEC IR transparent conductive coatingH. Demiryont, Eclipse Energy Systems, Inc.This paper presents an innovative IR transparent conductive coating.The coating is a vacuum deposited thin film system which is nearly 90transparent in the 1.3 to 27 micron spectral region, having 2.5 ohmssqrsheet resistance and 35 dB of the shielding effectiveness in the 0.1 to100GHz frequency region. The spectral transparency of the Eclipse IRTEC samples was evaluated on ZnS substrates and electrochromicvariable emissivity control, ECDVE, systems. Eclipse IRTEC was usedas a watchport electrode for the ECDVE system to observe theemissivity modulations. Films deposited on ZnS substrates wereoptically tailored to reach 80 transmittance in the mid IR region. Theshielding effectiveness of the transparent conductive samples evaluatedon 10X10 substrates exhibit 35dB value in the 4 to 16GHz region.654533, Session 6The effects of mesh voids on the insertion loss ofmetallic mesh coatingsJ. I. Halman, K. A. Ramsey, S. Rodenbaugh, Battelle MemorialInstituteMetallic mesh thin film coatings have been used for many years toprovide electromagnetic interference EMI shielding on infraredwindows and domes.  During the fabrication of these micronsizedmesh patterns, mesh voids or holes in the mesh pattern occasionallyoccur.   Holes in the mesh degrade the EMI shielding or insertion loss ofthe mesh coating.  In the past we have shown that a small number of 1mm voids do not degrade the insertion loss significantly for 20 dBinsertion loss meshcoatings.  In this paper, we will examine the numberand size of mesh voids that can be tolerated without degrading the EMIshielding properties of 25 to 30 dB insertion loss meshcoatings.  Wewill measure the insertion loss of several typical metallicmesh coatingswith and without voids and compare the results with a simple insertionloss model654534, Session 6Update on the development of highperformanceantireflecting surface relief microstructuresD. S. Hobbs, B. D. MacLeod, J. R. Riccobono, TelAztec LLCMicrostructures built into the surfaces of an optic or window, have beenshown to suppress the reflection of broadband light to unprecedentedlevels.  These antireflective AR microstructures form an integral part ofan optic component, yielding an AR property that is as mechanicallydurable, radiationhard, and resistant to damage from high opticalenergy, as the bulk material.Three types of AR surface relief microstructures are being developed fora wide variety of applications utilizing light within the visible to very longwave infrared spectrum.  For applications requiring broadbandoperation, Motheye AR textures consisting of a regular periodic array ofcone or hole like structures, are preferred.  Narrowband applicationssuch as laser communications, can utilize the very high performanceafforded by subwavelength structure, or SWS AR textures that consistof a periodic array of simple binary, or step profile structures.  Lastly,Random AR textures offer very broadband performance with a simplemanufacturing process, a combination that proves useful for costsensitive applications such as solar cells, and for complex devices suchas silicon and HgCdTe sensor arrays.An update on the development of AR microstructures will be discussedfor many specific applications.

ALONs optical andmechanical properties are isotropic by virtue of its cubic crystallinestructure.  Consequently, ALON is transparent in its polycrystalline formand can be made by conventional powder processing techniques.  Thiscombination of properties and manufacturability make ALON suitablefor a range of applications from IR windows, domes and lenses totransparent armor.

Previously we had reported on the use ofnew approach to the synthesis of spinel powders via the reaction ofsurface modified boehmite and magnesium acetylacetonate.  While thisapproach produced fine grained spinel powders, it has limitations ofhigh cost and laborintensive purification of the magnesiumacetylacetonate.  A reevaluation of the reaction mechanism hasallowed us to identify lowercost and higher purity magnesium sourcesfor the lowtemperature metalexchange reaction. Properties of thepowders and preparation of transparent spinel windows using the newmaterials will be discussed.654539, Session 7Recent advances in magnesium aluminate spinelT. J. Mroz, L. M. Goldman, R. Twedt, C. Warner, Surmet Corp.Magnesium aluminate MgAl2O4 spinel is a material of interest forwindows and domes in visible to midwavelength infrared MWIRapplications where demanding optical, physical and environmentalconditions exist.  Spinel has properties similar to Sapphire and ALON,but has advantages over each. Relative to sapphire, spinelsadvantages are that it has isotropic optical and mechanical properties.Consequently, it can be produced by conventional powder processingtechniques and is substantially easier to grind and polish. Relative toALON, which can also be produced by powder processing, Spineltransmits further into the MWIR, making it preferable for certainapplications.Significant improvements in processing have resulted in an improvedspinel material, which combines high strength 46 Ksi and excellentoptical performance. This improved process has been used to producefull scale windows and domes. Results to be presented will includescale up to large size flat windows, as well as optical and mechanicalcharacterization of the improved spinel material itself.654540, Session 7Polycrystalline transparent spinel domes for multimodeseeker applicationsA. A. DiGiovanni, A. LaRoche, L. Schubel, L. Fehrenbacher,Technology Assessment and Transfer D. W. Roy, ConsultantThe transmission characteristics of polycrystalline MgAl2O4 spinelexceed that of both ALON and sapphire at the end of the midwave IRspectrum, which makes it especially attractive for the everincreasingperformance requirements of current and nextgeneration seekerplatforms. With a theoretical transparency from the UV through theMWIR of up to 87, transparent spinel ceramics are being evaluated ina wide range of optical applications including windows, domes, armor,and lenses. Technology Assessment and Transfer Inc. TAT haveestablished a 9000 ft2 production facility for optical quality spinel basedon the traditional hotpressing followed by hot isostatic pressingHIPing route. The hot pressing method has proved the most viable forhigh aspect ratio parts such as windows, which can be pressed in largestacks similar to commercial opaque armor products. Complicatedshapes, however, like spherical domes, require a highly scalable, nearnet shape processing method. Pressureless sintering is a processingmethod that forms the basis of the traditional ceramic industry. Bytaking advantage of the polycrystalline nature of the spinel ceramic,near net shape green parts can be produced, such as a dome, and thenfired and ultimately HIPed to transparency. These two main processingapproaches, hot pressing and pressureless sintering, allow the widestvariety of applications to be addressed using a range of opticalcomponents and configurations. This paper will address some of thechallenges to fabricating optical quality spinel domes and windows withrespect to starting raw material through forming and ultimately firing.654541, Session 7Recent developments in transparent polycrystallinespinel and other transparent ceramicsI. Aggarwal, Naval Research Lab.The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory NRL has developed a uniqueprocess which allows very controlled and uniform sintering ofpolycrystalline ceramics into full transparency.   The process is highlyreproducible.  It facilitates sintering to occur at lower temperatures andtimes resulting in a uniform microstructure with fine grains and superiormechanical and optical properties. High optical quality spinel ceramichas been fabricated in various sizes and shapes and is readily scalableto industrial sizes to produce large windows  domes for variousapplications including HEL windows to survive in hostile environmentsas well as light weight transparent armor for personnel protection. Inaddition, this process has been used to make transparent Yb3 dopedY2O3 ceramic laser material with potential for very high power output ataround 1 m.In both cases, for spinel and Yb3 doped Y2O3, we have developed thecapability to make high purity powder and then sintered this to makehigh optical quality ceramics. We will describe the processingconditions used to make the powders and ceramics, and then discusthe optical properties of these ceramics.654542, Session 7Spinel and BGG glass composite domesS. S.

Kirsch, U.S. Army Research,Development and Engineering CommandBarium GalloGermanate BGG glass has excellent transmission in thevisible and infrared wavelength region and is therefore useful for manyapplications.  This presentation focuses on the development of spineland BGG composite domes.  In order to do this, a modified BGG glasscomposition was specifically developed which wets and bonds to thespinel. The new glass was also designed with matching refractive indexand coefficient of thermal expansion CTE to optimize the opticalproperties and minimize the thermal stresses, respectively. We havedemonstrated excellent bonding between spinel and BGG glass flatsand also dome shapes. The bonded substrates have been very stableunder severe thermal cycling runs. Preliminary bonding with anintermediate metal grid has also been very promising. We will presentthese and other results from environmental testing Ultra Violet lightexposure and rain erosion resistance.654543, Session 7Investigation of critical parameters for grinding largesapphire window panelsJ. Bashe, I. Akwani, G. Dempsey, D. L. Hibbard, Exotic ElectroOptics, Inc.Advancements in optical manufacturing and testing technologies forsapphire material are required to support the increasing use of largeaperture sapphire panels as windscreens for various electroopticalsystem applications.  Surface grinding is a crucial step in both thefiguring and finishing of optical components. Improper grinding canmake the subsequent polishing operations more difficult and timeconsuming. Poor grinding can also lead to the introduction of surfacestress and subsurface damage which can affect critical optomechanical performance characteristics such as strength and durability.Work is presently underway at Exotic ElectroOptics to investigate anumber of process enhancements in the grinding of aplane sapphire.EEO has completed a twelve run PlackettBurman design of experimentDOE to study the effects of fundamental grinding parameters onsapphire panel surfaces. The results of that study will be presented.Conf. 6545 Window and Dome Technologies and Materials X92 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654544, Session 7Clear large aperature sapphire sheets CLASStm foraerospace and transparent armor applicationsC.

The newest addition tothe CLASS product line is CLASS400tm, measuring 400 mm wide.Recent development effort has led to thicker CLASS225tm products.The main applications of CLASStm are for aerospace FLIR windowsand transparent armor. Crystal quality, transmission, scatter, andballistic testing on CLASS products will be discussed.654545, Session 7Improvements in large window and optics productionB. Hallock, W. Messner, C. Hall, C. Supranowitz, QED TechnologiesInc.Fabrication of large optics has been a topic of discussion for decades.As early as the late 1980s, computer controlled equipment has beenused to semideterministically correct the figure error of large opticsover a number of process iterations.  More recently, MagnetorheologicFinishing MRFr has been developed and commercialized topredictably and reliably allow the user to achieve deterministic resultson a variety of optical glasses, ceramics and other common opticalmaterials.  Large optics such as primary mirrors, conformal optics andoffaxis components are efficiently fabricated using this approach. Morerecently, specific processes, MR fluids and equipment have beendeveloped and implemented to enhance results when finishing largeaperture sapphire windows.MRF, by virtue of its unique removal process, overcomes many of thedrawbacks of a conventional polishing process.  For example,lightweighted optics often exhibit a quilted pattern coincident with theirpocket cell structure following conventional padbased polishing.  MRFdoes not induce midfrequency errors and is capable of actuallyremoving existing quilt patterns.  Further, odd aperture shapes and partgeometries which can represent significant challenge to conventionalpolish processing are simply and easily corrected with MRF tools.Similarly, aspheric optics which can often present multiple obstacles particularly when lightweighted and offaxis  typically have a departurefrom bestfit sphere that is not well matched with static padbasedpolishing tool resulting in pad misfit and associated variations inremoval.  The conformal subaperture polishing tool inherent to the QEDprocess works as well on typical circular apertures as it does onirregular shapes such as rectangles and trapezoids for example andmatches the surface perfectly at all points.   Flats, spheres, aspheresand offaxis sections are easily corrected.  The schedule uncertaintiesdriven by edge roll and edge control are virtually eliminated with theMRF process.This paper presents some recent results of the deterministic finishingtypified by the QED product line and more specifically of its largeaperture machines, presently capable of finishing optics up to onemeter in size.  Examples of large sapphire windows and meterclassaspheric glass optics will be reviewed.  Associated metrology concernswill also be discussed.654546, Poster SessionPolarization discriminating optical filters based onsurface relief microstructuresD. S. Hobbs, TelAztec LLCMany defense and security applications rely on optical sensorscombined with wavelength selective optical filters to identify uniquefeatures of a target, or to identify friend versus foe.  Lasercommunications systems also depend on optical filters to removebackground light and to increase the signal detection range.  Theaddition of polarization discriminating filters would allow a significantincrease in signal detection range for a laser communications system,an additional level of information encoding for security systems, and anincreased ability to discriminate targets from background clutter inimaging sensors.  Conventional multilayer thinfilm optical filters arenot capable of polarization discrimination, are not rugged enough fortypical space or military applications, and are too expensive forcommercial security applications.Surface structure resonant, or SSR, optical filters are a low cost, highlydurable alternative to thinfilm filters that also offer the potential forunique functionality such as multiple pass or rejection bands in a singledevice.  SSR filters are constructed as an array of microstructures builtdirectly in the surface of an optical component such as a window orlens.  One SSR microtexture can perform to a level that would requiremany hundreds of stacked material layers in a conventional thinfilmfilter design.  Because SSR filters operate through a resonantinteraction with microstructures, by fabricating nonabsorbingasymmetric surface structures a highly efficient SSR filter can berealized that simultaneously discriminates both wavelength andpolarization.The design and fabrication of polarization discriminating SSR filters builtinto the surface of visible and infrared light transmitting materials suchas fused silica and ClearTran, will be discussed.  Optical performancedata for prototype structures will be presented together with adiscussion of target applications such as polarizing color filters fordisplays, nearinfrared security tags and communications, and linearvariable filters for long wave infrared hyper and multispectral imaging.654547, Poster SessionParticle impacterosion phenomena and materials failurefor supersonic KVSK. George, Jr., M. Wilson, MilSys Technologies LLC B. E. Moylan,U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development andEngineering Ctr.A project has been undertaken as part of a Phase II, Small BusiniessInovative Research Program SBIR to evaluate material response ofSi3N4 when impacted by rain drops or other atmospheric particulate.Central to this project is the development of finite element model usingLSDYNA to simulate the impact event. Although this approach hasbeen used to a certain degree of success in the past, the current projectaims to attain a higher degree of fidelity by considering materialdiscontinuities or fractures within the matrix. Also, the evolution ofdamage through repeated, random impacts will be studied andquantified, perhaps by using a mechanisticallybased probabilisticmodel. The finite element model will be evaluated through the executionof an empirical impact test program conducted at the Marshal SpaceFlight Center. Impact specimens will be made from two grades ofSi3N4 1471B and 14731N.  In addition, supporting work will becarried out to update atmospheric rain drop density information in suchdocuments as MILSTD 210C or its replacement MILHNBK310.654548, Poster SessionReduced angleshift infrared bandpass filter coatingsB. M. Lairson, J. Mosier, K. Gibbons, J. H. Sternbergh, M. George,Deposition Sciences, Inc.A common problem with infrared bandpass filter coatings is thecharacteristic wavelength shift associated with changes in the angle ofincidence.  This shift limits the signaltonoise performance available toa detection system, due to the wider passband required toaccommodate the shift.  In addition, for particularly wideangleapplications, divergence between s and ppolarization exacerbates theloss of performance.  We have developed a coating system whichminimizes this degradation, by increasing the average refractive indexavailable for stack design, and incorporating the ability to preciselycontrol thicknesses of the coating materials across curved surfaces.The durability of the coating allows use in harsh environments.Examples of improvements of performance for specific wavelengthbands and requirements will be discussed.Conf. 6545 Window and Dome Technologies and Materials X spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 93Conf. 6546 Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance ISRSystems and Applications IVWednesday 11 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6546 Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, ReconnaissanceISR Systems and Applications IV654601, Session 1Key performance requirements for military lowlighttelevision camerasG. B. Heim, S. E. Shimer, Ball Aerospace  Technologies Corp.Lowlightlevel video cameras have benefited from the incredibleadvances in digital technology over the past two decades.  In legacycameras, the video signal was processed using analog electronicswhich made real time, nonlinear processing of the video signal verydifficult to implement.  In stateoftheart cameras, the analog signal isdigitized right from the sensor and is processed entirely in the digitaldomain, enabling the application of many advanced processingtechniques to the video signal in real time.  In fact, all aspects ofmodern low light television cameras are controlled via digitaltechnology.  This results in many capabilities which were simply notpossible to implement using analog electronics.In addition to video processing, large scale digital integration enablesprecise control of the operation of the image intensifier and imagesensor in these low light level cameras, enabling large interscenedynamic range capability, extended intrascene dynamic range andblooming control. Digital video processing and digital camera controlare utilized to provide improved system level performance includingnearly perfect pixel response uniformity, correction of intensifierblemishes, and electronic boresight.  Compact digital electronics alsoenable comprehensive camera builtintest capability which providescoverage for the entire camerafrom photons into the sensor to theprocessed video signal out the connector.Individuals involved in the procurement of present and future lowlightlevel cameras need to understand these advanced camera capabilitiesin order to write meaningful specifications for their advanced videosystem requirements.  This paper provides an overview of thesemodern video system capabilities along with example specification text.654602, Session 1Signal processor for acoustic sensors on UAV platformsand ground vehiclesR. A. Wagstaff, The Univ. of MississippiOne way to gather intelligence, conduct surveillance, or performreconnaissance ISR for potential threat activities on the ground is touse acoustic sensors on rapidly moving ground and airborne vehicles,such as HMMWVs and UAV platforms. There are some significantchallenges in doing that.  One focus has been on the development of anacoustic sensor shroud that is specially designed to reduce the noisecaused by the highspeed flow of air past the acoustic sensor.Significant improvements have been achieved to date, but additionalimprovements are needed. An independent, and complimentaryapproach will be presented.  It involves an acoustic signal processorthat has been developed to preserve the acoustic signals, whileeliminating the component of flow noise that is not successfully filteredout by the shroud. The flow noise that remains is eliminated by thecombined exploitation of two independent FluctuationBased ProcessorFBP temporal coherence parameters. One parameter is related to thespectral phase, and the other parameter is related to the spectralamplitude. This FBP recognizes the incoherence of flow noisemeasured by both coherence parameters, and uses their incoherence toeliminate the noise.   Simultaneously, the processor also recognizes thetemporal coherence of signals and uses it to preserve them. Themanner in which these two parameters preserve the signals andeliminate the flow noise will be described. Results will be presented toillustrate this FBPs performance with measured acoustic data from anairborne vehicle with an air speed of 50 knots.654603, Session 1High performance Sagnac interferometers for LWIRhyperspectral imagingP. G. Lucey, K. A. Horton, T. J. Williams, Univ. of Hawaii at ManoaImaging interferometry in the infrared has several potential advantagesfor hyperspectral imaging in airborne reconnaissance.  Infraredhyperspectral offers daynight capability and interferometers offer thepotential for very low power systems. The multiplex advantage enableshigh sensitivity when using uncooled detector arrays and the largethroughput enables the use of uncooled optics when using usingcryogenic detectors.  These characteristics translate into low power andrapid response.  We will present measurements and model results usingSagnac interferometers to illustrate the potential of this technology forairborne reconnaissance.654604, Session 1A rugged 65gram IR dual FOV MAV payloadJ. Wisted, J. Leighton, Fluke ElectronicsThis paper will present an ultralight weight, 65 gram, dualimageinfrared camera. The camera has been optimized for use in small microair vehicles, as well as other weightsensitive applications.  There arethree key features of the system.  First, it has no moving parts, as thecalibration shutter has been removed.  The technological hurdle ofremoving the shutter from conventional uncooled VOx imagers wasovercome by innovative software correction techniques. This shutterless operation renders the camera significantly more rugged and allowsits use in environments that were previously intolerant of such systems.Second, the assembly contains a onepiece rigidflex board design.This adds significantly to ruggedness and assembly simplicity.  Finally,the two lenssensor assemblies incorporate sturdy, yet extremely lighthousings.  The design considerations for such a system will bedescribed and the resulting performance tradeoffs will be detailed. Thehighquality imaging of this camera system will be demonstrated anddescribed in association with the technical design considerations.Ongoing considerations for small formfactor cameras will be describedwhere the significance is relevant.654605, Session 2GlobalScanner a very high resolution miniaturized EOreconnaissance airborne systemH.

Larroque, Thales Optronique FranceToday, as a alternate operational choice replacing the satellite IMINT,many Forces worldwide expressed the need to acquire a StrategicLOROP capability, able the collect day and night imagery at long or verylong standoff ranges. If the natural trend coming for optics engineersfrom the wet film technology is to enlarge the focal length in order toachieve the better spatial resolution GSD, Ground Sampling Distance,within airborne constraints, the laws of physics are unfortunately limitedby the restrictions of oblique atmosphere transmission, by the quality ofthe window buffing but also by the ability to achieve a nearly perfectstabilization performance when the sensor is integrated on board thecollecting platform.Now, the maturity of digital imagery techniques and processing has ledto optimize the full imagery chain and the sensor optics architecture inorder to guarantee an acceptable and useful operational imageresolution performance more oriented towards a larger operational DRIcapability Detect, Recognize, Identify within many overseas operationsunder various climatic conditions.In particular, step and stare imagery collection allows today some imageaccumulation capability through a high rate of imaging on the samescene  and thus is able to enhance to SN Signal to Noise ratio, evenwhen the number of photons crossing the field between the target andthe detector remains very poor. On the same line, this techniqueassociated with a high image rating technology is also able to imagelarge areas while permitting a high VH Velocity Height ratio givingagain a larger and more flexible operational Recce capability withregards to the tactical situation on the battlefield.654618, Session 2DB110 reconnaissance the 3rd generation system anupdateM.

M. Irvine, G. OBrien, S. A. Israel, D. M. Cannon, ScienceApplications International Corp. C. P. Fenimore, J. W. Roberts,National Institute of Standards and Technology J. Bartolucci, TheBoeing Co.The motion imagery community would benefit from the availability ofstandard measures for assessing image interpretability.  The NationalImagery Interpretability Rating Scale NIIRS has served as a communitystandard for still imagery, but no comparable scale exists for motionimagery. Previous studies have explored the factors affecting theperceived interpretability of motion imagery and the ability to performvarious image exploitation tasks. More recently, a study demonstratedan approach for adapting the standard NIIRS developmentmethodology to motion imagery.  This paper presents the first step inimplementing this methodology, namely the construction of theperceived interpretability continuum for motion imagery.  We conductedan evaluation in which imagery analysts rated the interpretability of alarge number of motion imagery clips. Analysis of these ratingsindicates that analysts rate the imagery consistently, perceivedinterpretability is unidimensional, and that interpretability varies linearlywith logGSD. This paper presents the design of the evaluation, theanalysis and findings, and implications for scale development.654609, Session 3Metrics to estimate image quality in compressed videosequencesG.

A. Israel, Science Applications International Corp.A fundamental problem in image processing is to find objective metricsthat agree with human perception of image quality.  In this study,several metrics were examined to rate compression algorithms in termsof perceived loss in image quality.  In addition, we sought to describethe relationship of image quality as a function of bitrate.  Thecompression schemes used were JPEG2000, MPEG2, and H.264.  Theframe size was fixed at 853x480 and the encoding varied from 6000Kpsto 200Kps.  The metrics examined were PSNR, SSIM an edgelocalization metric and a blur metric.  To varying degrees the metricsdisplayed desirable properties, namely they were monotonic in the bitrate, the GOP structure could be inferred, and they tended to coalescewith human perception of quality degradations.  Additional work isbeing conducted to quantify the sensitivity of these measures withrespect to our Motion Imagery Quality Scale.654610, Session 3Useroriented evaluation of compression for motionimageryJ. M. Irvine, G. OBrien, S. A. Israel, Science ApplicationsInternational Corp. C. P. Fenimore, J. W. Roberts, National Instituteof Standards and Technology J. Bartolucci, The Boeing Co. D. M.Cannon, Science Applications International Corp.Motion imagery will play a critical role in future intelligence and militarymissions. The ability to provide a real time, dynamic view and persistentsurveillance makes motion imagery a valuable source of information.The ability to collect, process, transmit, and exploit this rich source ofinformation depends on the sensor capabilities, the availablecommunications channels, and the availability of suitable exploitationtools. While sensor technology has progressed dramatically and variousexploitation tools exist or are under development, the bandwidthrequired for transmitting motion imagery data remains a significantchallenge. This paper presents a useroriented evaluation of severalmethods for compression of motion imagery.  We explore variouscodecs and bitrates for both inter and intraframe encoding.  Theanalysis quantifies the effects of compression in terms of theinterpretability of motion imagery, i.e., the ability of imagery analysts toperform common image exploitation tasks.  The findings haveimplications for sensor system design, systems architecture, andmission planning.654611, Session 3Perceptual evaluation of frame rate effects on theinterpretability of motion imagery IIC.

Aviles, National Institute of Standards andTechnology J. R. Miller, L. Simon, S. A. Israel, Science ApplicationsInternational Corp. J. Bartolucci, The Boeing Co. and ScienceApplications International Corp.The development of a motion imagery MI quality scale, akin to theNational Image Interpretibility Rating Scale NIIRS for still imagery,would have great value to future intelligence and military users ofsurveillance and other MI systems. In a multiphase study, we haveadopted a perceptual approach to identifying the main attributes thataffect motion imagery interpretibility. The exploitation of the richinformation content of motion imagery data depends, in part, on thecharacteristics of the communication channels, where the bandwidthrequired for transmission is a very significant, continuing challenge. Oneapproach to this challenge is to lower the frame rate. This paperpresents a perceptual evaluation of the effects of decreasing frame rateon the interpretibility of motion imagery. We consider motion imagery atframe rates from 30.0 Framess Fps to 1.0 Fps as well as still imagery.The study includes both synthetic and liveaction imagery. Imageryanalysts were tasked to perform simple detection and identificationtasks.  As frame varies, interpretibility depends on the task we find thatsuccessful identification decreases monotonically with frame rate, butthat detection is enhanced as frame rate decreases to about 10 Fps.The findings have implications for sensor system design, systemsarchitecture, and mission planning.654613, Session 4An OEFOIF study of close combat missions using smallunmanned aircraft systemsG. Lifschitz, R. J. Tierney, J. Vitalie, U.S. Army Test and EvaluationCommandThe Small Unmanned Aircraft System SUAS is a rucksack portableaerial observation vehicle designed to supplement reconnaissance,surveillance and target acquisition tasks of an infantry company.  TheRaven is an earlier version of the SUAS and has been used for the pasttwo years by Special Operations Forces SOF and selected Army unitsin Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom OEFOIF.  ArmyTest and Evaluation Commandled surveys were used to assess thecapabilities and limitations of the Raven in OEFOIF.  Results andanalyses of the surveys indicate that Raven enhances situationalawareness of a small unit in urban areas and in selected close combatmissions.  Users of the Raven state it is easy to use, although there aremajor issues with frequency deconfliction, airspace management, shortendurance, and sensor performance.  The SUAS completeddevelopmental and operational testing in preparation for full rateproduction.  This paper addresses the SUAS effectiveness, suitability,and survivability evaluation strategy based on actual testing of thesystem.  The SUAS was found to be useful in certain infantry companyclose combat missions where terrain and visual line of sight give thesystem an advantage over traditional reconnaissance patrols.  Armyaviation and infantry units uncover new ways every day to use thisportable eye in the sky, especially when unmanned aerialreconnaissance assets are in premium demand.  A discussion isincluded on changes in doctrine with the SUAS, its integration intofuture combat systems and its likely benefits to the Soldier.654614, Session 4Field test of an airtoground communication link using abare optical fiberJ. C. Juarez, A. Dwivedi, R. M. Sova, J. E. Sluz, D. W. Young, JohnsHopkins Applied Physics Lab.The need of for capacity in military networks will continue to grow dueto the emerging demand of bandwidth intensive applications such asairborne imagery, surveillance, and communications. Current military RFcapabilities provide 100s Mbps per link, but are reaching a limit withrespect to spectrum and bandwidth efficiency. Fiber opticcommunications are an appealing alternative because their informationcarrying capacity easily surpasses other current technologies.Additionally, the optical fiber is immune to the environment and isresistant to exploitation and jamming.  However, fiberopticcommunications are usually limited to static, predeployed cablesystems.  Enabling fiber applications in dynamically deployed or adhocconditions will open up a large number of communication possibilities interrestrial, aerial, and oceanic environments. Applications on platformslike Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAV, balloons, and aerostats or airshipsare of particular relevance.A field demonstration of an airtoground communication link using aselfsustainable optical fiber will be described. The test was conductedby JHUAPL at the TCOM, L.P. Test Facility in Elizabeth City, NC in May2006 using a 38 m, tethered aerostat raised to an altitude of 2000 ft. Abare, single mode fiber attached between the aerostat and its mooringstation was evaluated as an optical link for several hours. Multiplexedchannels operating in the 1550 nm band at 1 and 10 Gbps were testedand used to achieve error free data transfers. A cw channel was alsomultiplexed for performance monitoring. BER vs. link power tests will bedescribed. Eye diagrams and video quality of service data will also bepresented.654615, Session 5Unlimitedsize mosaicking of airborne image dataN. Jiang, C. Li, Arizona State Univ. G. P. Abousleman, GeneralDynamics C4 Systems J. Si, Arizona State Univ.This paper presents a system that creates and navigates an unlimitedsize mosaic with geographical information. The input is a sequence ofairborne images with or without telemetry data, and the output is amosaic with a combined geographical coordinate layer inherited fromthe input images.  Rather than registering input images with anorthoimage, which is popular in existing applications, the proposedsystem does not depend on prior information. The airborne imagesembedded with geoinformation are pairwise registered, based onimage feature correspondence. We extract feature points and form anEDGEbased descriptor for image registration. Subsequently, thegeographical coordinate layers derived from the telemetry data streamare fused using a registration matrix computed from the previous step.However, due to the unreliability of the telemetry data, the new geodeticcoordinate layer might be inconsistent with the image coordinate layerand therefore requires rectification to minimize the squared errorbetween the mosaic coordinate layer and the warped geographicalcoordinate layer. The above process is incorporated into a clusterframework so that the output mosaic is extensible to an infinite size.That is, once the current mosaic has expanded beyond computermemory limitations, the image is saved to a database.  Its spatialrelationship with respect to the world coordinate system is also savedto the database so that the system can navigate the collection of imagemosaic data by querying the spatial database and retrieving the relevantmosaics. This method is especially suitable for video sequencesspanning large regions, such as surveillance video from a UAV.  Resultswith realworld UAV video are provided to demonstrate the performanceof the proposed system.654616, Session 5Reconfigurable device for enhancement of longrangeimageryF. E. Ortiz, E. J. Kelmelis, P. F. Curt, EM Photonics, Inc.Atmospheric effects greatly degrade the quality of images collected byland, sea, and skybased platforms when imaging over great distances.Random atmospheric turbulence blurs imagery in a nonuniform andvariable fashion.  Assuming ideal observation conditions, the minimumfeature size that can be resolved using a given optical system isbounded by the diffraction limit 1.22  wavelength D, which dictatesthat larger apertures enable finer features to be distinguished. However,in largeaperture systems, turbulence and air movement become thelimiting factors long before the diffraction effects appear.  Recoveringdata lost due to this effect requires computationally intense imageprocessing algorithms.  One such algorithm is the Bispectrum SpeckleImaging Method.  This method allows for recovery of data near thediffraction limit of the imaging system without prior knowledge ofatmospheric conditions.  Unfortunately, it is far too computationallyConf. 6546 Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance ISRSystems and Applications IV96 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssintense for a software version to run in real time and thus is currentlyonly suitable for postprocessing.  In this paper, we present our latestwork in mapping this algorithm into a reconfigurable hardware platform.This device will allow for the real time processing of highdefinitionvideo signals, many orders of magnitude faster than is possible from thesoftware implementation.654617, Session 5On a nascent latencyinformation theoryE. H. Feria, College of Staten IslandCUNYThe central theme of Shannons mathematical theory of communicationis information. Information is defined as the essential part of thememoryspace used to represent the output of a signal source.Computationtime is the time dual of memoryspace. In turn, latency isthe central theme of a novel mathematical theory of recognition which isthe computationtime dual of Shannons theory. Latency is defined asthe minimum amount of computationtime associated with the scalaroutput of a signal processor after the signal processor is redesignedsubject to implementation components and architectural constraints.Processor coding was developed earlier as the computationtime dualof source coding. In this paper the computationtime memoryspaceduality development continues when it is noted that the computationtime dual of channel coding is sensor coding. While channel codingdeals with the space displacement of memoryspace in a noisy channelenvironment, it is shown here that sensor coding deals with the timedisplacement of computationtime in a timelimited sensor environment.In addition, it is found that the cascade of a sensor coder with aprocessor coder is an intelligent system. The developed ideas areillustrated with a realworld knowledgedaided radar application.Acknowledgement This research was funded in part by DARPAsKASSPER Program Grant No. FA8750041004Conf. 6546 Airborne Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance ISRSystems and Applications IV spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 97Conf. 6547 Radar Sensor Technology XIGrand 7B, ThursdayFriday 1213 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6547 Radar Sensor Technology XI654701, Session 1Wideband SAR processing with segmented chirps forphasedarray radarsA. W. Doerry, Sandia National Labs.Fine resolution SAR requires wideband signals to be transmitted andreceived.  Electronically steered phasedarray antennas have difficultysteering wideband signals without the use of expensive andcumbersome true time delay elements.  More desirable phase shiftersare by themselves inadequate to the task.Wideband radar signals can be generated from series or groups ofnarrowband signals centered at different frequencies.  A widebandLinear FM LFM chirp can be assembled from lesserbandwidth chirpsegments.  The chirp segments can be transmitted as separate pulses,each with their own steering phase operation.  Each chirp segmentsbandwidth would essentially be narrowband by itself.  Doing so allowseach pulse to be steered by phase shifters alone.  This overcomes theproblematic dilemma of steering wideband chirps with phase shiftersalone.  True timedelay elements are not required.The Phase History data can then be processed in a manner toreconstruct the image by combining all pulses with all chirp segments.In this manner the image will exhibit resolution consistent with the entireresolution bandwidth, which can be much larger than any individualsegments chirp bandwidth.Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, aLockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energyunder Contract DEAC0494AL85000.654702, Session 1Anisotropic diffusion techniques on synthetic apertureradar dataJ. D. Allen, E. Ganthier, Harris Corp. G. B. Tenali, Florida Institute ofTechnologySpeckle in SAR imagery is a byproduct of constructive and destructiveinterference between scatterers within a resolution cell. This specklephenomenon gives SAR imagery a noiselike appearance and is oftenexploited in near angle andor coherent stereo pairs.  However, in manycases, this speckle is unwanted and can be considered noise orinterference. We use partial differential equation PDE methods forspeckle mitigation for detected imagery and the collected compleximage data. In particular, we study the effect of nonlinear anisotropicdiffusion filters on collected SAR image data. In the past, anisotropicdiffusion AD techniques have been successfully used in the analysis ofEO data. However, the use of these techniques on SAR image data isrecent and much is yet to be done. We expect the application of ADtechniques on SAR image data in combination with a fluid dynamicperspective to yield rich dividends in terms of image interpretability.Through our approach we demonstrate that it is possible to spatiallymaintain areas of high dynamic range bright scatterers and smoothareas of low dynamic range in the scene. We also exhibit the role ofthese nonlinear filters in correlation, registration, compression,decompression, and image interpretability for SAR analysts.654703, Session 1Results from an xband synthetic aperture radarcollection in AntarcticaD. L. Bickel, G. Sander, Sandia National Labs. W. Hallman, TheNational Guard Bureau J. Bradley, Sandia National Labs. M.Armstrong, New York Air National GuardIn January, 2006, the New York Air National Guard requested thatSandia National Laboratories develop an Xband synthetic apertureradar to use for an experiment to detect crevasses in Antarctica.Sandia provided a MiniSAR radar that was modified to operate at Xband.  Data was collected with this system in the Antarctic summer of2006.  The results from this data collection are presented in this paper.Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, aLockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energyunder Contract DEAC0494AL85000.654704, Session 1Bistatic VHF and UHF SAR for urban environmentsJ.

Bistatic results and SAR images from initial experimentsperformed in the urban environments of Linkoping during 2006 with anairborne transmitter and a stationary receiver at the VHFband will bepresented and compared to corresponding monostatic results.654705, Session 1Two joint timefrequency transforms for velocityseparation of moving target synthetic aperture radardataM. A. Ferrara, D. G. Arnold, Air Force Research Lab. M. Cheney,Rensselaer Polytechnic InstituteThis paper describes work that considered two Joint TimeFrequencyTransforms JTFTs for use in a SARbased single sensorplatformSynthetic Aperture Radar 3D imaging approach. The role of the JTFT isto distinguish moving point scatterers that may become collocatedduring the observation interval. A Frequency Domain Velocity FilterBank FDVFB was compared against the wellknown Short TimeFourier Transform STFT in terms of their maximalsimultaneous TimeFrequency energy concentrations.  The FDVFB and STFT energyconcentrations were compared for a variety of radar scenarios.  In allcases the STFT achieved slightly higher energy concentrations whilesimultaneously requiring half the computations needed by the FDVFB.654706, Session 2Detection and tracking of humans and vehicle targetsusing high definition television signals in urban areasE. F. Greneker III, Georgia Tech Research InstituteThe detection and tracking of humans and vehicles using radar systemsoperating at microwave frequencies was first achieved almost 40 yearsago.  Personnel detection radars have been used on the battlefield foralmost as many years. Each generation of these radars has improvedtheir overall detection and target recognition capability. To date, almostall of these radars have incorporated a colocated monostatictransmitter and receiver.  Two decades ago the bistatic human andvehicular detection radar was introduced and used for security atnuclear weapons manufacturing facilities, military bases and other highvalue targets.  In these applications the bistatic radar fence uses atransmitter and receiver that are a matched pair transmitter and receiverand located at each end of a bistatic baseline.  An intruder breaks themicrowave beam and is detected.This paper describes quicklook experiments that have beenconducted in the Atlanta, Georgia area to detect humans and vehiclesusing very long baseline bistatic radar techniques. More accuratelydescribed, the system to be described is a passive radar requiring nocoordination between the receiver and transmitter.  The illuminationsource transmitter is a High Definition Television HDTV broadcasttransmitter located approximately 19 miles from the test area.  Thetransmitter is broadcasting the broadband digital signal and also a pilot98 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsscarrier on a frequency of 548.310 MHz. It is the continious wave CWpilot carrier that is used for the experiments to be described.  Thesystem utilizes a commercial offtheshelf COTS communicationsreceiver.  A set of multielement back to back Yagi antennas are used toprovide a reference signal and the signal from the area where thehuman subject is located.  The walking human generates microDopplerthat can be detected using microDoppler signal processingtechniques. Vehicular targets can be detected without specialprocessing due to a vehicles larger radar cross section and higherDoppler shift higher velocity.  The technical challenges that have beenaddressed include receiver stability, common signal cancellation, andmultipath situations and geometries.  The technique has also beentested inside of a building and it has been found that humans can bedetected through walls and down long halls.654707, Session 2Estimation of electromagnetic parameters and thicknessof a wall using synthetic aperture radarH. C. Khatri, C. Le, Army Research Lab.One of the challenges of using synthetic aperture radar SAR to detectand classify an object behind a wall consists of determining the amountof signal attenuation introduced by the signals propagation through thewall. This attenuation is difficult to determine because theelectromagnetic properties of the wall, along with its thickness arenormally not known a priori. We describe a procedure for determiningthe necessary parameters given that the SAR has high enoughresolution such that the front and the rear surfaces of a uniform wall orcinder block wall can be determined from the SAR image. In addition,we provide a procedure for estimating the signal level behind the wall,or equivalently the attenuation due to the wall from measured returnsfrom its front and rear surfaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness ofthis procedure using data generated by XPATCH simulations.654708, Session 2Performance of autofocusing schemes for single targetand populated scenes behind unknown wallsF. Ahmad, M. G. Amin, Villanova Univ.The quality and reliability of throughthewall radar imagery is governed,among other things, by the knowledge of the wall characteristics.Ambiguity in wall characteristics has a twofold effect. It smears andblurs the image, and also shifts the imaged target positions.  Higherorder standardized moments have been shown to be good measures ofthe degree of smearing and blurriness of throughthewall images.These moments can be used to tune the wall variables to achieveautofocusing. It is noted that the solution to the autofocusing problem isnot unique and there exist several assumed wall characteristics, inaddition to the exact, that lead to similar focused images. In this paper,we analyze the dependency of the tuned wall parameters on the targetdistribution in the presence of single uniform walls. We consider singleand multiple target cases with different scene complexity andpopulation. The paper deals with both point and extended targets.Supporting simulation results are also provided.654709, Session 2Adaptive seethroughthewall imaging the IRISalgorithmJ. A. Marble, Univ. of Michigan H. Bagci, Univ. of IllinoisUrbanaChampaign A. O. Hero III, E. Michielssen, Univ. of MichiganThe Iterative Redeployment of Illumination and Sensing IRIS algorithmis an adaptive imaging scheme that deploys imaging resourcesaccording to the content of the scene being imaged. In this work theIRIS algorithm is applied to the area of SeeThroughTheWall radarimage reconstruction. The algorithm works iteratively in four steps i Itobserves the scene at an initial location and creates a scattering modelof the environment. ii It generates a confidence map to determinepoorlymeasured areas of the scene based on the scattering model. iiiIt places virtual transmitters at locations of uncertainty in the scene andutilizes an electromagnetic field solver to compute the electric fieldsexiting the building. iv It uses an information gain criteria to determinethe next location for the imaging array outside the building. Previousversions of the IRIS used a simple geometricaloptics basedelectromagnetic solver.  In this work, a more sophisticated Method ofMoments MoMbased field solver is utilized.  This solver is capable ofsimulating two dimensional 2D scattering problems involving lossydielectric scatterers.  In order to allow for analysis of electrically largescatterers, the solver is accelerated by using a 2D Adaptive IntegralMethod AIM. The acceleration is achieved by exploiting the spatialinvariance of the Greens function through the use of an auxiliaryuniform grid that encloses the scatterer. The computational complexityof the AIMaccelerated solver scales as ONclogNc as opposed toclassical MoMbased solvers computational complexity, ONv2  Here,Nc and NcNv are the numbers of cells discretizing the scatterer andthe nodes of uniform grid, respectively. Further acceleration is achievedby parallelization, which reduces the computational cost toONclogNcp per processor, where p is the number of processors. Thefinal product of this fourstep iterative scheme is an image of the scenethat has been constructed from a few carefully placed imaging arrays.654710, Session 2MicroDoppler analysis of multiple frequency continuouswave radar signaturesM. G. Anderson, R. L. Rogers, The Univ. of Texas at AustinMicroDoppler refers to Doppler scattering returns produced by nonrigidbody motion.  MicroDoppler gives rise to many detailed radarimage features in addition to those associated with bulk target motion.Targets of different classes for example, humans, animals, andvehicles produce microDoppler images that are often distinguishableeven by untrained observers.  MicroDoppler features have excellentpotential for use in automatic target recognition algorithms.  Althoughthe potential benefit of using microDoppler in classification algorithmsis high, relatively little experimental nonsynthetic microDoppler dataexists.  Much of the existing experimental data comes from highlycooperative targets human or vehicle targets directly approaching theradar.  This research involved field data collection and analysis ofmicroDoppler radar signatures from noncooperative targets.  The datawas collected using a low cost Xband multiple frequency continuouswave MFCW radar with three transmit frequencies.  The collectedMFCW radar signatures contain data from humans, vehicles, andanimals.  The presented data will include microDoppler signaturespreviously unavailable in the literature such as crawling humans andvarious animal species.  The animal microDoppler signatures willinclude deer, dog, and goat datasets.  This research focuses on theanalysis of microDoppler from noncooperative targets approachingthe radar at various angles, maneuvers, and postures.  The microDoppler content of the MFCW radar signatures will be analyzed in thejoint timefrequency domain.654711, Session 2Sparse array of RF sensors for sensing through the wallR.

Sizer, Bell Labs.Technology that can be used to unobtrusively detect and monitor thepresence of human subjects from a distance and through barriers can bea powerful tool for meeting new security challenges, includingasymmetric battlefield threats abroad and defense infrastructure needsback home. Our team, a collaboration between researchers at theUniversity of Hawaii UH,  the University of Florida UF, and Bell Labs,Lucent Technologies is developing mobile remote sensing technology forbattlespace awareness and warfighter protection, based on microwaveand millimeterwave Doppler radar motion sensing devices that detecthuman presence. This technology will help overcome a shortfall ofcurrent seethroughthewall STTW systems, which is, the poordetection of stationary personnel. By detecting the minute Doppler shiftsinduced by a subjects cardiopulmonary related chest motion, thetechnology will allow users to detect personnel that are completelystationary more effectively. This personnel detection technique can alsohave an extremely low probability of intercept since the signals used canbe those from everyday communications. The software and hardwaredevelopments and challenges for personnel detection and count at adistance will be discussed, including a 2.4 GHz quadrature radar singlechip silicon CMOS implementation, a lowpower double sideband Kaband transmission radar, and phase demodulation and heart rateextraction algorithms. In addition, the application of multiple inputmultiple output MIMO techniques for determining the number ofsubjects will be discussed.654713, Session 3Generating precision nonlinear FM chirp waveformsA. W. Doerry, Sandia National Labs.It is wellknown that NonLinear FM NLFM chirp modulation canadvantageously shape the transmitted signals Power Spectral Densitysuch that the autocorrelation function i.e. matched filter output exhibitssubstantially reduced sidelobes from its Linear FM LFM counterpart.Consequently, no additional filtering is required and maximum SignaltoNoise Ratio SNR performance is preserved.  This yields a 12 dBadvantage in SNR over the output of a LFM waveform with equivalentsidelobe filtering.  However precision NLFM chirps are more difficult todesign, produce, and process.This paper presents design and implementation techniques for NonlinearFM waveforms.A simple iterative design procedure is presented that yields a NLFMphasefrequency function with the desired inherent sidelobe response.We propose to then generate the NLFM waveform by using a cascadedintegratoraccumulator structure.  Several specific architectures areexamined to meet target performance criteria, including bandwidthconstraints and sidelobe reduction goals.We first examine a fixed parameter set to generate a fixed polynomialphase function.  Polynomial coefficients are selected to be constantduring the pulse.Alternatively, a NLFM waveform can be generated via integrating astepped parameter set, whereby parameters are constant over specificintervals, with the pulse width encompassing multiple intervals.  Theparameter changes in steps during the course of the pulse as a functionof time.Alternatively, the parameter steps can be made a function of the pulsesinstantaneous frequency.Sandia is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, aLockheed Martin Company, for the United States Department of Energyunder Contract DEAC0494AL85000.654714, Session 3Vehiclemounted UWB radar for improvised explosivedevice detectionO. Kegege, C. Ibarra, J. Li, H. Foltz, The Univ. of TexasPanAmericanIEDs pose a great danger to the troops.  A detection system is requiredto help in warning and preventing injury from these devices. Contrastingto systems that base their detection on the identification of the IEDinitiation mechanisms or IED explosives, we set out to investigate anddesign a system for detection of bomb shells directly. UWB radar hasthe advantage of both high resolution and good penetration. Ourimmediate objective is to assess the capability of UWB radar asadditional detection mode. The ultimate goal is to develop a vehiclemounted UWB radar system for identification of buried targets includingroadside IEDs.  Such a system shall be able to detect the target at asafe range on the move, to provide visual feedbackwarning to thevehicle operator of a potential target, and to assist in gonogodecisions.

H. Nguyen, J. P. Sichina, Army Research Lab.Synthetic aperture radar SAR imagery is formed using radar datacollected from a moving platform aircraft, vehicle, human, etc..  Theradar transmits and receives backscatter signals in downrangedirection at a fixed pulse repetition interval PRI while the platformmoves along crossrange direction to generate a synthetic aperture.  Inthe ideal situation, the platform moves at a constant speed and as aresult, the radar will collect the phasehistory data that are uniformlysampled along the aperture.  However, in many situations the radarplatform cannot be kept at a constant speed, e.g. a helicoptermaneuvers over an imaging area for surveillance.  The problem is evenworse in the case of urban warfare with humanborne radar.  A soldiermoves at his own speed and creates erratic aperture sections withphasehistory data that are either sparse or dense.  The collected SARdata in such situation will result in SAR imagery with severe artifactsthat might prevent us from detecting targets of interest.In this paper, we will present the SAR imagery of nonuniform aperturedata formed using the backprojection image formation algorithm.Although the backprojection image former is well suited with anarbitrary radar aperture, the SAR image artifacts are obvious from thenonuniform aperture.  Using the nonuniform aperture phasehistorydata, we interpolate the data using a uniform grid along the aperture.We will show the resulting imagery with reduced artifacts.  We will useboth simulated data and the Army Research Lab BoomSAR data toillustrate the artifacts generated by nonuniform sampling and theimprovement using this interpolation technique.Conf. 6547 Radar Sensor Technology XI100 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654716, Session 3Localization of nodes and personnel in multistatic radarnode sensor networkJ. R. Yee, V. M.

Expeditionary warfighters are faced withunknown enemy threats from behind barriers, for which extremeprecautionary measures must be encumbered to minimize risk. Wepropose to use a miniature handheld Doppler radar, as mobilesensor, in combination with a network of small scattered receivernodes which lie in wait and report on change or motion within atargeted perimeter. Radar nodes could be deployed from a distance, forexample they may be airdropped. The first problem to be addressed insuch a system is localization of radar nodes, which will further provideinformation on personnel location. A mobile sensor produces aninterrogation signal, and analyzes locally received echoes for signs ofmotion activity in the targeted area. Scattered nodes in the targetedvicinity form an adhoc network which also receives and compares themobile sensor signal and its target echoes, and reports sensed activityto the mobile sensor. We will describe a protocol to calculatelocalization estimates for radar nodes, that could be extended tolocalization of personnel within the perimeter of the nodes. Thedevelopment of the protocol is based on an optimization model wherethe objective is to minimize the mean squared error of the localizationestimates.  The protocol solves the optimization model using distributedcomputation as well as specifies the information needed to be passedto neighbor sensor nodes.654717, Session 3Polarimetric, combined, short pulse scatterometerradiometer system at 15GHz for platform and vesselapplicationA.

Ahmad, M. G. Amin, Villanova Univ. P. D. Zemany, BAE SystemsSingle frequency Doppler radars cannot be used in range estimationdue to their range ambiguities.  An additional frequency can be used toincrease the maximum unambiguous range to accepted values for indoorrange estimation of moving targets. The dualfrequency technique usesphase comparison of the transmitted and received CW signals to providean estimate of the target range. It offers the benefit of reducedcomplexity, fast computation time, and real time target tracking.However, the dualfrequency approach for range estimation can becompromised due to the presence of frequency drift, noise, andmultipath. In the paper, we provide statistical analysis of the effect ofnoise and frequency separation on the bias and variance of the rangeestimate. We consider targets with both linear and simple harmonicmotions. Computer simulation are provided for illustrating theperformance as a function of SNR and bandwidth.654721, Session 4Indication of slowlymoving targets via change detectionK. I. Ranney, A. Martone, Army Research Lab. M. Soumekh, Univ. atBuffaloRadar systems have long been recognized as an effective tool fordetecting moving targetsa problem commonly referred to as movingtarget indication MTI. Recent advances, including Space Time AdaptiveProcessing STAP, allow for even more precise determination of atargets location relative to the radar. Still, most of these methodsapproach MTI from the point of view of parameter estimation, and thissort of an approach can become problematic when the target speed islow and its associated Doppler frequency is near zero. In such cases thetarget signature is masked by the stationary, background clutter. Anotherpotential drawback to STAP techniques arises from the fact that theyrequire a relatively large number of receive channels, adding additionalcomplexity to the radar system hardware.In this paper we present a movingtargetindication MTI technique thatis based on a change detection paradigm. That is, rather than estimatingthe Doppler frequency associated with a targets motion, we propose todetect subtle differences between simultaneously collected, complexSAR images. We use simulated data to illustrate the feasibility of theapproach under several different operating scenarios.654722, Session 4Prediction and detection of multiplescattering eventsfrom 3D GTDbased parametric scattering modelsM.

Microlocal analysis techniques were used to computethe locations of multiplescattering events within SAR data. Theproposed multiplescattering detection algorithm utilized the theory ofgeometric invariants to estimate the microlocal analysispredictedmultiplescattering events. After multiplescattering returns wereestimated, the algorithm employed the Generalized Radon Transform todetermine the existence of multiple scattering in the measured data.

S. Baird, R. H. Giles, Univ. of MassachusettsLowell W. E. Nixon,U.S. Army National Ground Intelligence Ctr.The Euler decomposition, when applied to the polarization scatteringmatrix, attempts to extract phenomenological information about thescattering target. Because the Euler parameters constitute a morephysically relevant set of parameters than the traditional HHVV ISARrepresentations, they have potential to improve ATR performance. TheEuler parameters usefulness in target recognition, however, is effectedby several layers of signature variability. Unfortunately, many of thevariability layers are often omitted in a typical ATR study. A completeATR algorithm was therefore developed that allows for all layers ofvariability and requires no previous knowledge of the targets position,orientation, or average reflectivity.

The generalapproach  and submethods used to construct the complete ATRsystem will be presented, including the methods to determine thetargets orientation, registration, and to compare it to a library of prerendered target images.

Qong, Kyushu Tokai Univ. JapanChange detection is an important application of the satellite images. Forpolarimetric SAR POLSAR images, it is ideal that scatteringgeometries of the same target should display resemblance betweenmultidate images, which are used in change detection applications,since the scattering mechanisms may change due to the dataacquisition geometry. However, sometimes it is difficult to achieve theseconditions. An attempt is made to maximize the resemblance betweenthe scattering geometries in multidate images for a specific target. Analgorithm is developed based on the polarimetric basis transformationalong with the polarization signatures. As a result, the resemblancebetween the scattering mechanisms of the same target in both imagesis maximized. The effects predicted by the theory are confirmed by thechange detection analysis of POLSAR data acquired by the JetPropulsion Laboratory SIRC mission and Japanese ALOSPALSARdata. We have confirmed that the results of this study can be utilizedwhen extracting differences between any two observations for fullypolarimetric SAR images.654728, Poster SessionA portfolio of products from the rapid terrainvisualization interferometric SARD.

N. Pergande, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire ControlPassive imaging for security and other applications has reached animportant level of development. Ka and W band imaging systems arenow commercial products, thanks to cheap and stable amplifiers. Whiledeployment numbers are still modest, improvements to these systemswill come from engineering and algorithm development, and notfundamental research. What research should focus on is system volumereduction and resolution improvements.Fundamental research has several potential paths to solve theseproblems. Silicon Germanium CMOS can build acceptable millimeterwave amplifiers, and while SiGe noise figure is higher than GaAs, theability to integrate RF and back end processing will push us closer to aCCDlike sensor. Antimony Arsenide features higher mobility than GaAs,with very low flicker noise and operation above 200 GHz which willreduce aperture size for equivalent resolution. Another potential path tohigher frequencies lies in MEMS technology, where microbolometersshow potential for operation into the THz region. Ultimately, systemsneed broad band monolithic detectors with built in analog and digitalfunctions.Finally, Sparse Array technology may build flat, conformal structureswith high resolution and relatively low detector count. Rather thansystem volume proportional to the cube of aperture size, Spares arraysallow volume proportional to the square of aperture size, with multimeter diameter apertures a potential goal. This paper will briefly discussthe time line of past innovations, and explore the advantages andchallenges of the new technologies that will drive this field forward.654802, Session 1Millimeterwave propagation through a controlled dustenvironmentD. A. Wikner, Army Research Lab.A oneweek experiment was conducted to determine the millimeterwave transmission loss due to dust.  Transmission data was collectedat 35, 94, and 217 GHz through a recirculating dust tunnel.  The dustwas engineered to have a density and particle size distribution equal tothe dust clouds formed by helicopters in an arid environment.  Theactual dust cloud characteristics were measured during the experiment.The millimeterwave measurements were noncoherent, usingtransmitting sources on one side of the dust tunnel and antennadetectors on the other.  The hardware was designed to minimize noiseand drift.  Even so, it was found that the transmission loss across the 1m dust tunnel at high dust densities was lower than could be measuredaccurately with the equipment.  Therefore, the results given are limitedto system noise and represent maximum transmission losses at thevarious frequencies.  The results show losses less than 0.02 and 0.08dB for 94 and 217 GHz respectively across one meter of dust withdensity 3000 mgm3.  The actual losses are lower and a long baselineinterferometer will be required to determine the loss values precisely.Despite the limitations of the experiment, the data show that millimeterwave imager performance will not be significantly impacted by even avery dense helicopter dust cloud.654803, Session 1A 190 GHz active millimeterwave imagerM. Brothers, G. P. Timms, J. D. Bunton, J. Archer, J. Tello, G. C.Rosolen, Y. Li, A. Hellicar, Commonwealth Scientific and IndustrialResearch Organisation AustraliaThe design and testing of a 190 GHz imaging system is presented. Thesystem features two beamscanning antennas one of which produces avertical, and the other a horizontal fan beam. By correlating the signalsfrom the antennas an estimate of the millimeterwave reflectivity at theintersection of the fan beams is obtained. Each fan beam is scanned byrotating a small subreflector within the antenna this simple rotationmotion allows rapid scanning. The system is portable, currentlyapproximately 0.6m x 0.6m x 2m high the key size constraint isprovided by the 450 mm aperture length of the antennas. The imagerhas an angular resolution of 0.25 degrees and a field of view of 14 x 14degrees, resulting in a raw image of approximately 50 x 50 pixels. Theraw image is processed using superresolution techniques.Images will be presented which show the capability of the system toimage metallic, plastic and ceramic objects beneath clothing. Theseimages were obtained by illuminating the scene with a frequencydoubled Gunn oscillator. While this paper focuses on active imaging,the system can also operate in passive mode with greatly reducedsensitivity.654804, Session 1Influence of complicated background noise on passivegroundbased radiometer with low elevation angleL. Wu, Huazhong Univ. of Science and Technology ChinaFocused on the features of the lowscattering targets far away in the airunder detection, the source of the complicated background noise whichenters passive groundbased radiometer is analyzed in detail, and theinfluence of complicated background noise on the target radiate signalreceived by the mainlobe and the minorlobe of passive groundbasedradiometer antenna is also analyzed separately.For the noise entering the mainlobe, the relationship of the elevationangle of radiometer, the frequency of radiometer, and the absorption ofthe background noise is analyzed, and shown as the curve in the plot.At the same time, for the noise entering the minorlobe, the effectintroduced by the variation of elevation angle of radiometer anddifferent terrestrial surfaces to the absorption of the background noiseby passive groundbased radiometer is also analyzed, anddemonstrated as a formula with several plots.At last, the mathematical models and theoretical curves introduced inthis paper are supported by the experimental data on measuring kindsof terrestrial surfaces brightness temperature using 8mm passivegroundbased radiometer. The conclusion drawn in this paper can be avaluable reference for passive detection of lowscattering aerial targetsfor long distance.654805, Session 2High resolution passive millimeterwave securityscreening using few amplifiersC. A. Martin, A. Shek, V. G. Kolinko, Trex Enterprises Corp.Trex Enterprises has applied the frequency scanned antennaarchitecture found in the ST150 standoff imager to closein personnelscreening devices, including a fullbody imager and a handheldscanning imager.  These devices presnt the user with an image with 18inchsquare pixels using few amplifiers and a low level of mechanicalcomplexity.  The frequency scanned architecture permits theinstantaneous imaging of a linear array of 64 or 128 pixels with a singleamplfier maodule.  The linear imager or imagers are slowly mechanicallyscanned to provide a 2D image.  The imagers were used to captureimages of concelaed threat items at various thermal resolutuions,dependent upon mechanical scan speed.  The detection rate of threatsby the user is investigated using perception test software.  Thissoftware can determine the thermal resolution and level of operatortraining necesary for a certain rate of detection against a threat object.The software can also determine whether other system enhancements,such as IR fusion, can improve detection rates or reduce false alarms.104 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654806, Session 2Low cost imaging and sensing technologies for securityand defense applicationsB. J. Harker, Roke Manor Research Ltd. United KingdomThis paper describes some of the recent developments which haveoccurred at Roke in field of imaging and sensing technologies, forsecurity and defence applications. The paper describes three recentdevelopments which are based on technologies operating in themillimetrewave, submillimetrewave low terahertz and ultrawidebandregions of the frequency spectrum. An important objective of the workis to initiate and facilitate the transition from relatively costly and nonportable detectors over to lower cost and compact imaging systems,particularly in providing a standoff detection capability. The paperdescribes the applications, technologies, low cost designcharacteristics and concludes with an account for the future direction ofthe work.654807, Session 2Spectral decomposition of ultrawideband terahertzimageryE. N. Grossman, National Institute of Standards and Technology C.R. Dietlein, National Institute of Standards and Technology and Univ.of ColoradoBoulder J. Chisum, National Institute of Standards andTechnology A. R. M. Luukanen, MilliLab FinlandWe present passive indoor imagery of both artificial scenes testobjects and natural scenes human figures with threat items concealedbeneath clothing.  These are obtained using an ultrawidebandcryogenic microbolometer and a simple monochromator based onfrequencyselective surfaces, both of which have been described indetail elsewhere.  The bandwidth if the receiver, nominally 0.2  1.8 THz,is broad enough to span large variations 10 dB in clothingtransmittance and in diffractionlimited spatial resolution factor of x8.Certain features of the ultrawideband images make the presence ofthreat items in them easy to discern by eye with high detectionprobability and low false alarm rate.  We show that this can beunderstood by regarding the images as superpositions of lowfrequency images with good penetration and poor resolution and highfrequency images with poor penetration and high resolution.  Theimplication is that the favorable ROCcurve obtained with visualinspection could be obtained automatically when appropriate filtering isincorporated into the hardware.654808, Session 2Passive EuroAmerican terahertz camera PEATCAMpassive indoors THz imaging at video rates for securityapplicationsA. R. M. Luukanen, L. Grnberg, P. Helist, J. S. Penttil, H. Sepp,H. Sipola, MilliLab Finland C. R. Dietlein, National Institute ofStandards and Technology and Univ. of Colorado and MilliLabFinland E. N. Grossman, National Institute of Standards andTechnologyThe objective of this program is to demonstrate a system capable ofpassive indoors detection and identification of concealed threat itemshidden underneath the clothing of noncooperative subjects from astandoff distance of several meters. To meet this difficult task, we areconstructing an imaging system utilising superconductingultrawideband antennacoupled microbolometers, coupled to innovativeroom temperature readout electronics, and operated within a cryogenfree pulse tube refrigerator. Previously, we have demonstrated thatthese devices are capable of a Noise Equivalent Temperature DifferenceNETD of 125 mK over a predetection bandwidth from 0.21 THz usinga postdetection integration time of 30 ms. Further improvements onour devices are reducing this number to a few tens of mK. Such anexquisite sensitivity is necessary in order to achieve the undoubtedlystringent requirements for low false positive alarm rate combined withhigh probability of detection dictated by the application. Ourtechnological approach allows for excellent per frame NETD 0.2 K orbelow at 30 Hz frame rate, and is also amenable to multispectralcolour imagery that enhances the discrimination of innocuous objectsagainst real threats. In the paper we present results obtained with an 8pixel subarray from our linear array of 128 pixels constructed using amodular approach. Twodimensional imaging will be achieved by theuse of conical scanning.654809, Session 2Speckle in active millimeterwave and terahertz imagingand spectroscopyD. M. Sheen, D. L. McMakin, T. E. Hall, Pacific Northwest NationalLab.Wideband millimeterwave imaging techniques and systems have beendeveloped at PNNL for concealed weapon detection and otherapplications. These techniques evolved from singlefrequencymillimeterwave holographic imaging methods to wideband threedimensional planar and cylindrical techniques and systems. The singlefrequency holographic method was derived from optical and ultrasonicholography techniques. Speckle is highly significant in this case, and iscaused by constructive and destructive interference from multiplescattering locations or depths within a single resolution cell. Thewideband threedimensional techniques developed at PNNLsignificantly reduce the speckle effect through the use of high depthresolution obtained from the wide bandwidth of the illumination. Forthese techniques, speckle can still be significant in some cases andaffect image quality. In this paper, we explore the situations in whichspeckle occurs and its relationship to lateral and depth resolution. Thiswill be accomplished through numerical simulation and demonstrated inactual imaging results. Speckle may also play a significant role inaltering reflection spectra in wideband terahertz spectra. Reflectionfrom rough surfaces will generate speckle, which will result in significantvariation in the reflection spectrum as measured over very widebandwidths. This effect may make if difficult to interpret spectralabsorption features from general reflectance data. In this paper,physical optics numerical simulation techniques will be used to modelthe reflection from arbitrary random surfaces and explore the effect ofthe surface on the reflection spectra and reconstructed image.Laboratory imaging and numerical modeling results in the millimeterwave through the terahertz frequency ranges are presented.654810, Session 3Broadband THz Wave Photonics for Defense andSecurity ApplicationsX. Zhang, Rensselaer Polytechnic InstituteTerahertz THz radiation offers innovative sensing and imagingtechnologies that can provide information unavailable throughconventional methods such as microwave and Xray techniques. Withthe advancement of THz technologies, THz wave sensing and imagingwill impact a broad range of interdisciplinary fields, in particular, theopportunity for transformational advances in defense and security. Inrecent work THz technologies have shown promise regarding thestandoff detection and identification of explosives and their relatedcompounds. Handheld broadband THz spectrometry with realtimedetection capability in short distance for defense and securityapplications is available.This presentation will report on an allair THz photonic system whichuses ambient air as a broadband emitter and sensor with a commercialpulsed laser as an optical source. By transmitting and focusing opticalbeams in close proximity to the targets, broadband farinfraredTHzwaves can be generated and detected locally. This process reduces thefarinfraredTHz wave beam path in order to minimize the water vaporattenuation in the farinfrared region. Preliminary results on thegeneration, manipulation, enhancement, amplification, and detection ofhighly directional farIRTHz waves through the use of ambient air as anemitter, modulator, amplifier, and sensor medium will be presented.Conf. 6548 Passive MillimeterWave Imaging Technology X spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 105654811, Session 4Sparse aperture millimeterwave imaging using opticaldetection and correlation techniquesC. A. Schuetz, Univ. of Delaware R. Martin, EM Photonics, Inc. M.S. Mirotznik, The Catholic Univ. of America S. Shi, G. J. Schneider,J. A. Murakowski, D. W. Prather, Univ. of DelawareFor many applications, the usefulness of millimeterwave imagers islimited by the large aperture sizes required to obtain images of sufficientresolution.  Sparse aperture techniques could open up wider range ofapplications by mitigating the volume requirements of high resolutionimagers.  In previous proceedings, we have presented an approachtowards the realization of millimeterwave, sparseaperture imagersusing optical techniques.  By using electrooptic modulators toupconvert received millimeterwave fields onto an optical carrier, suchfields can be readily captured, routed, and processed using opticaltechniques.  Such techniques could provide significant advantages overtraditional heterodyne techniques.Herein, we present progress towards the physical realization of such animager.  Specifically, we discuss the implementation challenges thatmust be addressed to create such an imager and present in furtherdetail the numerous advantages such an approach will yield.  We alsopresent results obtained from a working prototype system and showthat these results are in good agreement with theoretical performancemodels.654812, Session 4Passive millimeterwave camera with interferometricprocessingH. Nohmi, NEC Corp. JapanThe passive millimeterwave MMW camera with interferometricprocessing will be presented. The system have been developed as aprototype of a nonrealtime imager to evaluate the characteristics ofMMW images. The basic configuration, processing algorism and theperformance were presented at SPIE 2006 in Orlando. The hardwareconfiguration and the software algorithm are based on interferometricprinciple. This system consists of two sets of a Wband front end with ahorn antenna, a receiver, an AD converter, highspeed processinghardware, and a computer for image reconstruction. The position ofthese two antennas with a Wband frontend moves on the precisionlinear slider in horizontal and vertical axis. The synthesized aperture sizeis 1m for horizontal and 50cm for vertical axis. The coherently receivedtwo channel signals are digitized and processed in the hardwareprocessor. The process is comprised of phase error compensation,correlation of all combination of each axis data, and integration toimprove the signal to noise ratio.  The computer input the integrateddata to make an image by matched filter processing. In this year, weimproved the performance. New LNAs were attached. The ADsampling frequency and signal band width were increased 10 times.The integration time is the same as the old system. The total SN ratiowas improved more than 10dB.

Looking at the mathematics of beamforming, the developments in technology and the end user requirementindicates a new architecture of imager might offer an attractiveprospect. The potential applications are reviewed and technological andphysics considerations are given in the performance prediction withrespect to the frequency. A programme to build a small demonstrator ofsuch a beamforming system is overviewed.654814, Session 4Passive mmwave imaging using two scanning fanbeamantennasY. Li, G. P. Timms, J. Archer, G. C. Rosolen, J. Tello, M. Brothers, A.Hellicar, Y. J. Guo, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial ResearchOrganisation AustraliaA prototype crosscorrelating 190 GHz passive mmwave imagingsystem has been developed. This system is based on the Mills Crosssystem used for radio astronomy imaging. It uses two pillbox antennasarranged in a T configuration. Each antenna generates a fan beam andthe two fan beams are orthogonal to each other. By crosscorrelatingthe signal received from the two antennas, an output is obtained whichis proportional to the millimeterwave intensity radiated from the targetat the intersection of the two fan beams. Beam scanning is generatedby rotating a small subreflector inside each antenna. As a result, theserelatively heavy antennas are stable during scanning and a high framerate can be achieved. Another advantage of this approach is that onlytwo receivers are required. The baseline the displacement between thephase centers of the two antennas of this system is not zero, becausethe phase centers of the two antennas are not located at the sameposition. The baseline generates a fringe in the imaging system and itsinfluence on the performance of the system is analyzed in this paper.The scanning speed of this system is also much faster than that of theMills Cross imaging system and its influence on the resolution is alsoanalyzed. It is found that the effect of the scanning speed is minimizedwhen the beam scans along the equalphase line of the fringe. Thissystem can also be used as an active imaging system and this isdiscussed in another paper.654815, Session 5Unamplified direct detection Wband imaging arrayJ. N. Schulman, J. J. Lynch, H. P.

Rajavel, HRLLabs., LLCThis paper describes HRLs design approach, fabrication, andmeasured results for a purely passive i.e. unamplified direct detectionreceiver that operates at W band.  These efforts are part of DARPAsMIATA program for passive millimeter wave imaging sensors.  HRLsreceiver integrates Sbbased backward tunnel diodes directly with anantenna to provide efficient collection of energy from the environmentand high sensitivity detection without the use of low noise amplifiers.The design approach allows for straightforward integration of multipleelements for 2D staring arrays and is amenable to low costmanufacturing.  The authors describe an integrated transition from Wband waveguide to the detector using common millimeter wave circuitboard techniques where the detector is located directly within thewaveguide cavity, thus providing a compact, efficient, and widebandtransfer of power to the detector.  Discussions of the design approachand tradeoffs will be followed by a description of the fabricationtechniques for the antenna array and millimeter wave printed circuitboard.

Prather, Univ. ofDelawareIn this paper we present several novel technologies for sensingmillimeterwave MMW radiation for imaging and spectroscopy basedon photonic devices. Along these lines, in our highsensitivity millimeterwave MMW imaging system, which is based on optical upconversion,the power of MMW radiation is transferred to the sidebands on anoptical carrier via an electrooptic EO modulator fed by a broadbandhorn antenna. The detection is realized by measuring the transferredoptical power of the sidebands. The sensitivity of this detection systemis primarily controlled by the conversion efficiency of the EO modulatorat the desired MMW frequency e.g. 95GHz. This requires that themodulators can work at an ultrabroad bandwidth and under a smalldriving voltage. In this paper, we present the design, fabrication, andcharacteristics of LiNbO3 travelingwave modulator for the MMWdetection system. In a travelingwave modulator, the bandwidth islimited by the mismatch between electrical and optical propagationconstant. We have developed several techniques to finely tune thepropagation constant of the MMW in the modulator and eliminated thismismatch. The further bandwidth limitations for the modulator are thelosses from the electrode conductor, the substrate and buffer layerdielectrics, and coupling between the travelingwave mode and thesubstrate modes. Some novel modulator structures have beenproposed to reduce those losses without increasing the device drivingvoltage. The bandwidth and conversion limits of these structures arealso discussed. The MMW detection pixels using the fabricatedmodulators were assembled, characterized, and analyzed. A highsensibility Wband detection system with a low noise equivalenttemperature difference will be demonstrated at a standard video rate of30 Hz.654819, Session 5Direct detection antennacoupled mmW sensors for thedetection of explosive vaporsM.

Gordon, RaytheonVision Systems and Raytheon Network Centric Systems G. Zummo,College of Optics  PhotonicsUniv. of Central Florida G. D.Boreman, Univ. of Central Florida L. P. Chen, Raytheon VisionSystems and Raytheon Network Centric SystemsThe low vapor pressure and concentration of explosive such as TNTand RDX pose significant problems for the detection of explosivevapors in the mmW bands.  For the positive identification of explosivevapors using an uncooled passive mmW imaging spectrometer with alow false alarm rate FAR requires an unprecedented sensitivity of 150fW.  We report on the recent development of a novel uncooled mmWantennacoupled direct detector, which shows promise of meeting thisrequirement.  Furthermore our technology is capable of beingimplemented as a spectrometer on a chip by using existing frequencyagile technology previously demonstrated at the University of CentralFloridaCREOL in the long wave infrared LWIR by the author1.Our antennacoupled direct detector works by collecting the incidentelectromagnetic radiation with a scalable, planar lithographic antennaelement.  The collected radiation is directly injected into the sensorelectronics, which rectify the signal.  The rectification of the radiation isachieved by using a GaAs Schottky diode to convert the high frequencyinput signal to DC power.  Using advanced semiconductor processing,Raytheon built sample GaAs Schottky diodes integrated with a halfwave dipole antennas with a measured noiseequivalenttemperaturedifference NETD of 10K at room temperature.  Additionalimprovements on the antenna design indicate that the directcombination of an optimum antenna design with our Schottky diodeenables unprecedented sensitivities in the 150 fW range 1K NETD.654820, Session 5FPGA acceleration of superresolution algorithms forembedded processing in millimeterwave sensorsF. E. Ortiz, E. J. Kelmelis, EM Photonics, Inc. D. W. Prather, Univ. ofDelawareSuperresolution reconstruction SRREC algorithms combine multipleframes captured using spatially undersampled imagers to produce asingle higherresolution image.  Subpixel information is gained fromnatural motion within the image instead of active pixel scanningditheringmicroscanning, eliminating the reliability issues and powerconsumption associated with moving parts.  One of the majorcomputational challenges associated with SRREC methods is theestimation of the optical flow of the image determine the unknown pixelshifts between consecutive frames.  A linear least squareapproximation is the simplest method for estimating the pixelmovements from the captured data, but the size of the problem directlyproportional to the number of pixels in the image creates acomputational bottleneck, which in turn limits the usability of thisalgorithm in realtime portable systems.  We propose the use of areconfigurable platform to implement these computations in a lowpowersize environment, suitable for integration into portable millimeterwave imagers.654821, Session 5Determination of dielectric material properties withpassive MMW measurements for security applicationsS. Dill, M. Peichl, H. Suess, DLR Standort OberpfaffenhofenGermanyMicrowaves in the range of 1300GHz are used in many respects forremote sensing applications. Besides twodimensional imagingmethods, the application for the extraction of depth information aboutthe material structure is of basic interest. For example the use of radarin mining and geology has a long tradition, and recently the applicationof radar and radiometric sensors was also considered for landminedetection. However, the investigated materials in those cases arealmost of a natural composition, but newer and future applications likepeople screening or throughwalls imaging require increasingly theanalysis of the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with manifoldartificial matter like building materials and textiles.In order to characterize the material of interest in the microwave region,its permittivity is of basic interest besides its physical structure. In manycases the permittivity is unknown, inaccurately known, or known foronly specific frequencies, and for a specific situation the range of valuesgiven in the literature can have a large variability. Several methods todetermine the permittivity can be applied. Basically we discriminateactive and passive methods, and measurements in a closed waveguide,coaxial line, or in free space using a specific antenna arrangement. Inaddition, the measurement of a specific material can be complicated byits physical size and structure, which rules out the use of a closed lineapproach as in the case of a waveguide.In this paper we describe a procedure to determine the permittivity fromradiometric freespace measurements of nearly arbitrary materials.

An estimation of the presentlyachieved precision is given and some representative results for MMWmeasurements of different materials are shown.654822, Session 5Aqueous blackbody system a novel THz absolutecalibration sourceC. R. Dietlein, National Institute of Standards and Technology andUniv. of ColoradoBoulder E. N. Grossman, National Institute ofStandards and TechnologyWe describe a novel broadband calibration source for the mmwave toTHz frequency band, the Aqueous Blackbody System ABS.  Theblackbody in this design is a body of water, which is extremelyabsorptive in this frequency range, held at a uniform and knowntemperature by a commercial immersion circulator.   The problem ofnonzero reflectance is not solved by specialized material properties aswith microwave anechoics but circumvented by use of a specialoptical trap geometry, as in the calibration of optical fiber powermeters Lehman et al 1998, Lehman  Cromer 2002.  The undesirablereflectance arises at the interfaces between the water and the walls ofthe expanded polystyrene EPS container.  EPS is used because of itsexceptionally high transmittance and nearunity refractive indexthroughout the 0.1  2 THz band.   The shape of the custommoldedcontainer is carefully designed to ensure that all beams incident withinthe acceptance area and solid angle of the source undergo four 45degree reflections  two s and two p orientations  off the waterEPSinterface. This ensures an effective emissivity  99 over the operatingband.  This has been verified by measurements of EPS transmittanceand geometric optics simulation over the entire band, and by spotmeasurements at selected frequencies of the effective reflectance of thecompleted source.Conf. 6548 Passive MillimeterWave Imaging Technology X108 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssConf. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications VMondayTuesday 910 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications V654901, Session 1Advanced terahertz imaging system performance modelfor concealed weapon identificationS.

Gritz, Raytheon Vision SystemsThe low vapor pressure and concentration of explosives such as TNTand RDX pose significant problems for the detection of thesecompounds.  Spectral sensing of explosive material requires aprioriknowledge of spectrum of the material.  We report measuredtransmittance spectra of solid and vapor samples of trinitrotoluene TNTin the spectral range 0.6 to 4.2 THz at resolutions up to 1 GHz using aFouriertransform spectrometer.  A uniform film of approximately 0.1 mmthickness of TNT on top of a polyethylene substrate was measured tocompare with previously reported data.  Our sample preparation led tostronger absorption for all of the lines previously reported, and we werealso able to resolve more structure in the spectrum. For spectroscopy ofTNT vapor, a 10 meter fixedlength long path gas cell was modified foruse in the THz range.  Additionally the gas cell was heated 15 C aboveambient to enhance the concentration of the TNT vapor.  The measuredspectrum reveals a broad strong absorption band at the low frequencylimit of the data.  The results suggest that TNT vapor absorptionremarkably increases below 35 cm1 or 1 THz, implying that mmwavespectral region holds promise for detection of TNT vapors.654903, Session 1Modeling and characterization of cloth at submillimeterwavelengthsE. L. Jacobs, S. T. Griffin, The Univ. of MemphisA primary source of clutter in submillimeter wave and terahertzimagery used in security applications is the random reflections fromclothing. In this paper, techniques for modeling and characterizing thesereflections are described. This work is motivated and, in part, based onprevious work done in support of imaging radar for remote sensing. Afirst order model of the response of a cloth covered object is describedalong with a method for performing measurements on draped cloth. Themeasurement method involves the simultaneous measurement of thesubmillimeter wave response of the cloth and the underlying drape ofthe cloth. A rigorous model of the scattering from draped cloth isdeveloped and compared with results from the first order model.Conclusions regarding the suitability of the first order model for imagesimulation and performance predictions are stated.654904, Session 1Broadband terahertz timedomain and Ramanspectroscopy of explosivesA.

G.Davies, Univ. of Leeds United KingdomBroadband terahertz timedomain spectroscopy THzTDS has beenshown to be a valuable technique for the analysis of explosives anddrugsofabuse, and to be a possible tool for their detection. In thispaper, we present recent work on the use of THzTDS to analyse threepure explosives, 1,3,5trinitroperhydro1,3,5triazine RDX, 2Methyl1,3,5trinitrobenzene TNT, and 1,3Dinitrato2,2bisnitratomethylpropane PETN. Spectra have also been obtained of anumber of plastic explosives, plastics and dyes to allow for asystematic analysis of real world samples. Finally THzTDS spectra ofthe explosives have been studied over a range of temperatures. Thesevariable temperature measurements, when compared with Ramanspectroscopy measurements and molecular modelling calculations, canlead to a greater understanding of the vibrational modes observed inthe terahertz region of the spectrum.654905, Session 1Terahertz measurement and imaging detection ofdelamination and water intrusion in ground basedradome panelsD. A. Zimdars, J. S. White, G. Fichter, G. Stuk, Picometrix LLCWe demonstrate the ability of time domain Terahertz THz imaging tolocate and identify defects such as delaminations and water intrusion inadvanced composite materials used in ground based radome panels,shelters and towers. We show the ability of terahertz analysis, both withtime domain and Fourier domain i.e., spectroscopy analysis, to detectdefects of interest.  These measurements are used to generate 2 and3 dimensional highresolution maps of the composite materialstructures.  Additionally we demonstrate the feasibility to detect othertypes of defects, such as metal intrusions, resin poor or rich areas andfluid contaminations e.g., oil, fuel.654906, Session 2Towards an active realtime THz camera first realizationof a hybrid systemT. Lffler, C. am Weg, A. Alcin, B. Hils, H. G. Roskos, Univ. Frankfurtam Main GermanyIn this contribution we report the first realization of a hybrid system forstandoff THz reflectrometry measurements. The basic idea is tocombine the best of two worlds the high radiation power of subTHzmicroelectronic emitters and the high sensitivity of coherent optoelectronic detection. Our system is based on a commercially availablemultiplied Gunn source with a cw output power of 0.7 mW at 0.65 THz.We combine this with electrooptic mixing with femtosecond lightpulses in a ZnTe crystal. This schema can be described as heterodynedetection with a Tisapphire fslaser acting as local oscillator and spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 109therefore allows for phasesensitive measurements.Example images of test objects are obtained with mechanical scanningoptics and with measurement times per pixel as short as 10 ms. Thetest objects are placed at a distance of 1 m from the detector and alsofrom the source. The results indicate diffraction limited resolution.Different contrast mechanisms, based on absorption, scattering, anddifference in optical thickness will be employed. Based on carefulsignaltonoise determination, we conclude that the system has thepotential to reach a power dynamic range of up to 8 orders ofmagnitude for singlepixel detection. Our evaluation shows that it will bepossible to realize a realtime multipixel detector with several hundredsof pixels and a dynamic range of at least two orders of magnitude inpower.In summary, our system represents a good starting point for the futurerealization of realtime active THz camera systems for security andother applications.654907, Session 2Terahertz standoff imaging testbed design andperformance for concealed weapon and deviceidentification model developmentC.

M. Sinyukov, R. B. Barat, D. E. Gary, Z. Michalopoulou, I. K.Zorych, J. F. Federici, New Jersey Institute of TechnologyTerahertz radiation can propagate through nonmetallic, nonpolarmaterials providing a positive detection of weapons and dangerousagents concealed behind barriers, such as clothing, book bags,envelopes etc.  In addition, many materials of interest for securityapplications for example C4, HMX, RDX, TNT have characteristictransmissionreflection spectra in the THz range.  Therefore, thesematerials appear as different colors to the THz detector as comparedto nonhazardous items.  Among other methods for THz detection,interferometric imaging is attractive for security screening applicationsdue to a potentially rapid and confident identification of lethal agentswith a limited number of THz detectors.  Also, a compact andinexpensive imaging system based on semiconductor lasers can bedesigned.In our group, we are developing a THz interferometric imaging systemfor standoff detection of concealed weapons, explosives anddangerous chemicalbiological agents.We present experimental results of 2D terahertz interferometric imaging.Only one detector placed at several positions is used to imitate theperformance of a detector array.  Interferometric images of a pointsource are in a good agreement with theoretical predictions.  At 0.5 m,an RDX sample is detected behind a nylon book bag barrier.  Thebarrier is 2 mm thick nontransparent to visible light.  Reconstructed2D interferometric images provide both spatial and spectral informationabout the target.  Also, we are exploring several modulation methodsthat can reduce the imaging time and increase the resolution of ourimaging system.654909, Session 2Terahertz imaging system for standoff detection ofthreatsH. Hbers, A. D. Semenov, H. Richter, U. Bttger, DeutschesZentrum fr Luft und Raumfahrt e.V. GermanySuicide bombers and hidden bombs or explosives have becomeserious threats especially for mass transportation. Until now there existsno established system which can be used against these threats.Therefore new technologies especially for standoff detection of threatsare required. Due to their unique properties such as penetration ofclothes terahertz THz rays offer an alternative inspection method,which can cope with these new challenges. In this contribution thedesign and results of a THz standoff imaging system will be presented.The sensor is based on active illumination of the object and sensitiveheterodyne detection of reflected and backscattered radiation. A THzlaser is used for illumination and a superconducting hotelectronbolometric mixer for detection. The local oscillator required forheterodyne detection is a multiplied microwave source. Imaging isachieved by raster scanning of the object. The optical system isdesigned to allow for standoff detection up to 20 m. Such a systemmay eventually lead to an increased level of security in public placesand improve the security of mass transportation for example at airportsor train stations.654910, Session 3A high resolution terahertz spectrometer for chemicaldetectionA. J. Majewski, Goodrich Corp.Goodrich has been developing a high resolution, broad bandspectrometer that operates in the Terahertz THz region of thespectrum with the intent of performing chemical detection. THzspectroscopy exploits rotational resonances for detection of gas phasecompounds. High resolution THz spectroscopy at MHz scales canimprove detection and identification through increased probability ofdetection and reduced false alarms.The Goodrich THz spectrometer is based upon CW photomixertechnology in a heterodyne configuration. The current Goodrich designoffers continuous tunability across a 0.001 GHz to 1.2 THz frequencyrange. One of the unique aspects of the Goodrich spectrometer is lasersystem control that has demonstrated difference frequency line widthson the order of 1.5 MHz with stability measured over a 110 secondtime scale. Absolute frequency accuracy is of the order of 4 MHz. Thespectrometer design enables high THz energy densities with narrow linewidths over a broad spectrum. The system has demonstrated SNRbetter than a cryogenically cooled hot electron bolometer. Thiscapability allows the Goodrich system to accurately determineabsorption signatures of multiple chemicals with exceptionalperformance.Goodrich has completed initial system testing and verified performance.Initial tests were completed in a single pass spectrometer configurationto determine SNR of the heterodyne photomixer transceiver. Systemperformance was also verified for laser line width, stability, andrepeatability. The spectrometer was tested against various toxicindustrial chemicals. Preliminary data for HCN, HCl, NH3, and SO2 willbe presented.Conf. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications V110 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654911, Session 3Realtime THz detection using microbolometer infraredcameraB. N. Behnken, G. Karunasiri, M. Lowe, Naval Postgraduate SchoolD. R. Chamberlin, P. R. Robrish, Agilent Technologies, Inc. J. Faist,Univ. of Neuchatel SwitzerlandThe THz wavelengths cover the frequency range of  0.110 THz or 303000 micrometer wavelength band.  Currently, the detection of THzradiation is carried out using either antennacoupled semiconductordetectors or superconducting bolometers.  The imaging of objects usingthese detection schemes requires complex scanning mechanisms whichlimits the applications involving real time imaging.  For fast detection it isdesirable to employ the focal plane arrays which leads to more compactsystems.  Photon detectors used in infrared require cooling whichbecomes stringent as the detection involves THz wavelengths.  On theother hand, thermal detectors which are based on temperature change asa result of infrared absorption have a broad wavelength response andoperate at room temperature.  The advances of microbolometertechnology allow real time imaging in the 713 micron wavelength rangewith sensitivities close to that of the cooled counterparts.  However, theirability to detect THz radiation is relatively unknown.  In a recentexperiment using a 160x120 uncooled microbolometer focal plane array,we have successfully demonstrated real time imaging using a 3.7 THz 82micron quantum cascade laser beam with power less than 1 mW.  In thispresentation, operation of the microbolometer infrared camera in THzspectral band, and video recordings of the THz source with variousobjects obscuring it, will be presented.654912, Session 3A superconducting terahertz imagerT. May, V. Zakosarenko, S. Anders, H. Meyer, Institut fr PhysikalischeHochtechnologie e.V. Germany E. Kreysa, N. Jethava, MaxPlanckInstitut fr Radioastronomie Germany G. Thorwirth, JenaOptronikGmbH Germany M. Siegel, Univ. Karlsruhe GermanyMapping objects at frequencies around one terahertz from a significantdistance poses a considerable challenge for any imaging device. Thepower emission of bodies at room temperature is very weak, so a purelypassive map requires an extremely sensitive detector. Room temperaturedetectors are only applicable for actively illuminated scenes for a passivemap a cooled detector is required. Even if the imager is powerful enoughto operate passively it still can profit from an additional active illumination.For submm wavelength recently a big leap forward in the detectorperformance and scalability was driven by the astrophysics community.Superconducting bolometers and midsized arrays of them have beendeveloped and are in routine use. Concepts for larger devices are alreadyprojected. It is conceivable that such devices will become larger, lesscostly and available for a wider market. So a THz imager for industrial orsecurity applications based on superconducting detectors comes intoreach.Although devices with many pixels are foreseeable nowadays a devicewith an additional scanning optic is the straightest way to an imagingsystem with a useful resolution. Our superconducting THz imager SCOTIis a small cassegrain telescope with a scanning secondary mirrordesigned for a frequency of 0.34 THz. It can map objects from a distancebetween 5 meter and 20 meter using a small array of superconductingbolometers. The resolution at the object area is about 1 cm. Purelypassive images of interesting objects can be taken, opening a wide fieldof applications.654913, Session 4An integrated continuouswave terahertz biosensorM. Neshat, D. Saeedkia, Univ. of Waterloo Canada R. Sabri, DefenceResearch and Development Canada Canada S. SafaviNaeini, Univ.of Waterloo CanadaAn integrated continuouswave cw terahertz biosensor based on theedgecoupled terahertz photomixer source with guidedwave opticalexcitation scheme is proposed.In this device, the laser beams are guided inside an optical dielectricwaveguide structure and gradually absorbed by an overlying ultrafastphotoabsorbing layer, hence, generating a terahertz signal due tophotomixing phenomena. The generated THz signal is guided by acoplanarstripline CPS and is coupled to an integrated CPS resonator,which acts as a sample carrier and transducer.The great advantage of cw THz biosensors compared to their pulsedcounterparts is their higher frequency resolution, which results in highersensitivity and lower sample requirement. The proposed CPS resonatoris coupled directly to CPS transmission lines to avoid extra insertionloss due to transitions.As the result of interaction with the biosample, terahertz wave isguided by a CPS line to a wideband antenna and is detected by freespace photoconductive sampling technique. Performance analysis ofthe proposed cw terahertz biosensor supports the feasibility of thedevice. The proposed scheme is ideal for designing systemonachipterahertz sensors and spectrometers used for THz spectroscopy andsignature management.654914, Session 4Reflectivity and emissivity modeling for metals andplastics at THz frequenciesS. T. Griffin, E. L. Jacobs, The Univ. of Memphis S. R. Murrill, ArmyResearch Lab.The dynamic range of the signal return from metals is a significantsource of image interpretation difficulty. Techniques such as logarithmicimage compression have been used to improve the recognition.Alternative techniques for improvement may be developed. Thisdevelopment depends in part on the ability to accurately model thesurface reflective behavior including phase shifts introduced by thereflection. This work presents the results of an enhanced modeldevelopment. Models of high frequency behavior in materials divide intoregions such as nonrelaxation region, relaxation region, opticalabsorption and plasma frequencies. In traditional infrared and longerimaging systems, optical absorption may play a role and it is generallyassumed that the system operates in or very near the relaxation regiondefined as frequencies significantly greater than the reciprocal of theBoltzmann relaxation time. Though typical THz frequencies are belowthe relaxation time, they are not far enough below to be consideredcompletely in the nonrelaxation region. This introduces a number ofissues atypical of imaging in either the RF or IR regime.  Further realismis gained from the incorporation of plastic into the reflectivity andemissivity model.  Empirical model validation is accomplished forselected materials.654915, Session 4Guidedwave propagation on a cylindrical conductor atmillimeterwave or terahertz frequenciesJ. C. Wiltse, Georgia Institute of TechnologySurfacewave propagation on coated or uncoated conducting wires,rods, or tubes has been shown to provide low attenuation, moderatefield extent, low dispersion, and high powerhandling at frequenciesfrom 100 GHz to 1 THz. Typical conductors are copper, aluminum, orstainless steel. Uncoated conductors provide the lowest loss, whileconductors coated with a thin layer of lowloss dielectric such asTeflon, polystyrene, or polyethylene have the smallest field extent. Theguided mode is the TM01, often referred to as the Sommerfeld mode.The properties of the guided wave were theoretically analyzed by Kingand Wiltse in 1962, and measured results were obtained at 105 and 140GHz. In the last two years the work has been rediscovered, and nowfour different research groups have reported new results. While theearlier work was conducted in the search for long, lowlosstransmission lines 100 meters to 1 kilometer, the current applicationsare for lengths about 1 meter long, as might be used in probes. Therecent results will be summarized, and an optimized design will bepresented, along with general curves of attenuation, field extent, andpower handling capability from 100 GHz to 1 THz.Conf. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications V spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 111654916, Session 4THzfrequency vibrationalspectrum of DNA nucleotidesbounded to Si substratesB. N. Woolard, Athens Drive Senior High School P. Zhao, NorthCarolina State Univ.Biosensing systems are being developed widely due to their potentialfuture importance in medical and military applications. Two basicconcepts, direct sequencing and DNA hybridization , are presently thepreferred methods used for the detection and characterization ofpolynucleotides. More recently, the THzfrequency spectroscopy hasbeen identified as a potential new approach for the detailed analysis ofbiomolecules. Currently, one of the major hurdles facing THzapplications in biological science is its extreme sensitivity to watervapor absorption, which introduces an enormous obstacle for sensingthe available spectral signatures using traditional techniques. In thispaper, a new technique for labelfree detection of ultralowconcentrations of DNA molecules is investigated. This techniquecombines the advantages of both the DNA hybrization technique andTHz frequency spectroscopic detection. The goal is to utilizemeasurable phenomenon at the molecularlevel to avoid the problemsof signature acquisition introduced by obscurants such as water vapor.In this new approach, the detection of the DNA molecules is to bebased on the variations in electron current that are produced by theapplication of THzfrequency radiation. Here, the vibrational behavior ofthe bound DNA molecule is the key element because the THzexcitationof phonon modes has the potential to greatly influence average electronflux. In this paper, results are presented for the vibration spectrum of thebound DNA molecules and their utility in sensor applications. Thesestudies utilize the chemicalstructure analysis packages Amber andGAMESS to generate valuable information needed for understandingTHzbased DNA detectors.654917, Session 5Examining explosive residues on surfaces with terahertztechnologyM. J. Fitch, M. R. LeahyHoppa, R. Osiander, Johns HopkinsApplied Physics Lab.It is wellknown that many explosives have characteristic terahertz THzabsorption features, and that THz waves can penetrate many dielectricmaterials. However security applications generally prohibit using THztechnology for transmission measurements, either because of standoffdistances, thick targets, or opaque targets metals. As a result, wefocus our attention on THz reflection spectroscopy. A human fingerprintweighs about 0.05 mg. The potential to detect this small amount ofmaterial on a surface has a wide variety of applications includingsecurity and homeland protection. The capability to detect traceexplosives on surfaces with THz beams leads to noncontact andstandoff detection using THz technology. We have measured THzreflectivity signature of RDX fingerprints on ideal metal surfacescontaining about 0.4 mg of RDX. We will discuss our efforts in detectingtrace explosives in reflection as well as our recent results including THzspectroscopy of 4 explosives from 1 to 6 THz, and measurement of theabsolute absorption crosssection of explosives.654918, Session 5Unsupervised image segmentation for passive THzbroadband images for concealed weapon detectionM. D. RamirezVelez, C. R. Dietlein, Z. Popovic, Univ. of ColoradoBoulder E. N. Grossman, National Institute of Standards andTechnologyThis works presents results of applying a classical unsupervisedclassification algorithm for the segmentation of indoor passive terahertzimages. The 30,000 pixel broadband images of a person with concealedweapons under clothing are taken at a range of 0.82m over afrequency range of 0.11THz using singlepixel rowbased rasterscanning with spatial resolution of 48mm. The spiralantenna coupledNioboium bridge cryogenic microbolometers are developed at NISTTerahertz Imaging Laboratory, Optoelectronics Division. The antenna isevaporated on a 250um thick Si substrate with a 4mm diameterhyperhemispherical Si lens. The NETD of the microbolometer is 125mKat an integration time of 30ms.  The background temperature calibrationis performed with a known hotspot at 330K, and the measuredbackground fluctuation was 200500mK. Several weapons ZrO2 knife,metal gun, RAM AN72 were concealed under different fabrics cotton,polyester, windblocker jacket, and thermal sweater. Measuredtemperature contrasts ranged from 0.51K for wrinkles in clothing to 5Kfor a zipper and 8K for the concealed weapon.The image segmentation algorithm is divided in two stages 1 segmentthe NETD image data with a kmeans clustering algorithm and 2integrate spatial information. In the first stage, the second orderinformation computed by the image covariance matrix is included, andthe data is clustered using the Mahalanobis distance criterion. In thesecond stage, we plan to include spatial information estimated from theKolmogorov length scales, describing the characteristic distanceamong the objects in the image and compare it to knearest neighbors.654919, Session 5THz wave generation in inert gases and molecularvaporsM. Yamaguchi, Y. Chen, M. Wang, X. Zhang, Rensselaer PolytechnicInstituteDevlopment of intense THz wave source is one of the most urgentissues in the application of THz spectroscopy  to biological andchemical detections. However exisitng THz sources are tend to besaturated or damaged when they are excited with high energy opticalpumps. The development of intense THz sources based on novelgeneration mechanism is desirable.Recent years, the generation of THz wave in laser induced plasma hasbeen reported. We have been studying the THz wave generationmechanims in gaseous media.we will present the recent results of THz wave generaiton from laserinduced plasma in inert gases and molecular vapors. We have observedstrong THz wave emission from many of samples than the mostcommonly used ZnTe THz emitters.654920, Session 5Comparison of the THz absorption feature in lactose torelated saccharidesJ. E. Bjarnason, E. R. Brown, Univ. of CaliforniaSanta Barbara T. M.Korter, Syracuse Univ.Solidstate compounds such as lactose and biotin have been shown tohave narrow and intense THz absorption features at room temperature.We compare a frequencydomain tunable coherent THz photomixingspectrometer with a timedomain spectroscopy system anddemonstrate how the coherent spectrometer resolves finer absorptionlinewidths. Our interest in linewidths in the subTHz region is justifiednot only for practical reasons, since it is of crucial importance tospectroscopybased identification of materials, but also by theinformation the linewidths contain about the solidstate physics of thematerials. The linewidth of subTHz absorption features generally fromlattice vibrations in solids is excepted to be inversely proportional tothe scattering time of optical phonons. The linewidth of absorptionfeatures might thus have implications on the solidstate physics of thematerial, in particular, the interaction of phonons and the phonondensity of states. In this work, we show the narrow absorption line oflactose and compare it to the THz spectra of other di andtrisaccharides raffinose, maltose, sucrose, trehalose, and melecitose.Since lactose has a much more distinct absorption feature than any ofits closely chemically related saccharides, this comparison study is animportant step in understanding the mechanism of THz radiationabsorption by organic solids and what linewidths to expect in THzspectroscopy.Conf. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications V112 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss654927, Session 5Gain and farfield patterns for phasecorrecting Fresnelzone plate antennas at millimeterwave and terahertzfrequenciesJ. C. Wiltse, Georgia Institute of TechnologyThe Fresnel zone plate lens antenna, which provides advantagescompared to a normal paraboloidal or spherical lens, has beenextensively investigated in the millimeterwave and terahertz regions.The advantages include reduced weight, volume, and attenuation andsimplicity of design.  The principal disadvantage is that the zone plateoften provides reduced gain compared to a true lens, except at highmillimeterwave or terahertz frequencies where the low loss of the zoneplate more than compensates for the reduced directivity.  This paperinvestigates the gains and farfield patterns for a number of cases andgives both the analysis and numerical results for the examples.  Thesecases have dealt with largeangle designs, where the focal length Fand diameter D are comparable FD  0.5 to 2.5, unlike the typicaloptical examples.  The antenna patterns are found to have beamwidthsand first sidelobes that are similar to what one would obtain with astandard lens, given the same aperture illumination.  Appropriate feeddesigns are also described.  For best aperture efficiency the illuminationtaper is about 10 dB, and this gives first sidelobe levels of about 24dBfor a circular aperture.  Farout average sidelobes are not as low as for atrue lens, and this is where the gain is affected.654921, Session 6Performance comparison of Nb and NbN broadbandantennacoupled microbolometersC. R.

J. Papadakis, Johns Hopkins Univ. A. H. Monica, GeorgetownUniv. R.

The source is an Orotron, driven bya sheetbeam of electrons created by fieldemission from a carbonnanotube array.  For this talk, we discuss the parameters of the deviceand its predicted performance, and focus on the fabrication andperformance of the carbonnanotubebased electron gun, which mayalso find application as an ionization source for other types of sensors.Our goals include a large total current density in the sheetbeam, goodelectrical contact between the carbon nanotubes and the substrate,and reproducibility in the growth.  The carbon nanotubes are grown byconventional chemical vapor deposition of Acetylene gas on Siliconsubstrates, using evaporated iron thin films as catalysts.  In order tominimize the electrical resistance between the carbon nanotubes andthe Si substrate, we deposit the Fe directly on the Si in contrast tomost previous investigations which insert a diffusion barrier layer of ametal oxide between the catalyst and the Si.  We describe theconditions necessary to grow CNT arrays without this diffusion barrier,and offer hypotheses as to why the growth is successful orunsuccessful under various conditions.  We also discuss the effect ofthe catalyst pattern dimensions and shape on the effectiveness ofextracting a large current density from the emitters, as well as theeffects of pregrowth and postgrowth treatment of the samples withoxygen plasma.654923, Session 6Compact, mission configurable mmwave spectrometerbased on a channel drop filterE. I. Smirnova, A. G. Bailey, L. M. Earley, S. S. Kurennoy, LosAlamos National Lab.We have developed a novel mmwave spectrometer based on aPhotonic Band Gap PBG channeldrop filter CDF. There is a need fora compact wideband versatile and configurable mmwavespectrometer for applications in mmwave communications and remotesensing. PBG structures are twodimensional periodic structures ofrods. CDFs present us with a unique means for filtering frequencies atmmwaves. CDF is a novel concept allowing filtering the frequencyspectra and channeling selected frequencies into separate waveguidesthrough a PBG structure. We have designed a spectrometer with a CDFworking in the frequency range of 90130 GHz. The CDF can beconnected to any type of antenna and detector. A large ground basedoutdoor antenna can be used for remote sensing with radars. Acompact antenna can be used for indoor or space applications. Thesignal in the waveguide channels can be measured with any type ofsensor such as a cooled bolometer or a room temperature mmwavediode. The size of the spectrometer is under 5 inches by 5 inches andjust a quarter of an inch in thick. Multiple filters can be stacked togetherto construct a mission specific package. We propose to construct thefilter with silicon rods on a 100mm silicon wafer using MEMStechnology. We will then evaluate the filter at our mmwave laboratoryto demonstrate the channeling of frequencies in a proofofprincipleexperiment at 100GHz. This technology will work well for frequenciesfrom 60GHz to 1000GHz.654924, Session 6Compact fiber pumped terahertz sourceD. Creeden, J. C. McCarthy, P. A. Ketteridge, T. Southward, P.

In particular,THz spectroscopy of materials has revealed certain interestingConf. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications V spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 113properties of semiconductors paving way for new applications in theTHz regime.The first manifestation appears in the form of THz modulationexperiments, where recently highly efficient 3dB  5mW absorbedNIR THz modulation using CW optically excited Bdoped Si for bothpulsed and CW THz sources was demonstrated. However, usingspatially confined charge carriers in a Fresnel zone pattern, thepreviously demonstrated modulator can be transformed into a THz zonelens that is insensitive to current THz systems. Furthermore, spatialaberrations as well as other detrimental factors plaguing traditionallenses are easily overcome through pattern correction. Thus, acomplete adaptable THz optical system would be characterized by a Siwafer, CW optical source, and a spatial light modulator. Also followingthis prescription, any form of wavefront applications such as adaptiveTHz polarizers, wavefront imaging, and reflective gratings are possible.We will discuss preliminary results for optically controlled THz opticswith applications in military and homeland security.654926, Session 7Terahertz scanning FabryPerot interferometer based ondielectric mirrorsJ.

Boreman, Univ. ofCentral Florida O. J. Edwards, Zyberwear, Inc.A scanning FabryPerot interferometer composed of a pair of highreflectivity dielectric mirrors has been demonstrated in the range 0.075to 2.8 THz.  The mirrors are formed by alternating quarterwave layersof silicon and air in the usual Bragg configuration.  Characterization wasperformed using a gas laser together and Golay cell or using abackward wave oscillator and crystal detector or microwave powermeter. A finesse exceeding 410 for a FabryPerot cavity composed ofthreeperiod Bragg mirrors was experimentally demonstrated at 0.081THz, and this implies achieved mirror reflectivity of at least 99.24.Finesse values of several thousand are possible, which would enable acompact terahertz FabryPerot spectrometer with high free spectralrange and high spectral resolution simultaneously.  Such a device isdirectly suitable for airbornesatellite and manportable sensinginstrumentation.654928, Session 7Processing multispecies terahertz spectra for detectionof a particular speciesR. J. Noll, Goodrich Corp.In terahertz spectroscopy a critical problem is the separation of spectrafrom different molecules.  When trying to detect the presence of aparticular molecule in the presence of other molecules, it is important tofind ways to minimize the masking of the desired spectra by the variousbackground molecular spectra.  These background molecular spectraor interferents block the detection process of the desired spectra.   Thepresent paper describes the use of a principle components analysismethod that can enhance the fast detection of molecular species in thepresence of many other background constituents.  Examples of thisbackground interferent problem are given and how principlecomponent analysis can address the problem.Conf. 6549 Terahertz for Military and Security Applications V114 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssConf. 6550 Laser Radar Technology and Applications XIIWednesdayThursday 1112 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6550 Laser Radar Technology and Applications XII655001, Session 1Highresolution 3D coherent laser radar imagingJ. R. Buck, A. I. R. Malm, A. Zakel, B. W. Krause, B. G. Tiemann,Lockheed Martin Coherent TechnologiesThe Superresolution Sensor System S3 program is an ambitious effortto exploit the maximum information a laserbased sensor can obtain.  AtLockheed Martin Coherent Technologies LMCT, we are developingmethods of incorporating multifunction operation 3D imaging,vibrometry, polarimetry, aperture synthesis, etc. into a single device.The waveforms will be matched to the requirements of both hardwarei.e., optical amplifiers, modulators, etc. and the targets being imaged.The first successful demonstrations of this program have producedhighresolution, threedimensional images at intermediate standoffranges.  In addition, heavy camouflage penetration has beensuccessfully demonstrated.  The resolution of a ladar sensor scales withthe bandwidth as dR  c2B, with a corresponding scaling of the rangeprecision.  Therefore, the ability to achieve large bandwidths is crucial todeveloping a highresolution sensor.  While there are many methods ofachieving the benefit of large bandwidths while using lower bandwidthelectronics e.g., an FMCW implementation, the S3 system producesand detects the full waveform bandwidth, enabling a large set ofadaptive waveforms for applications requiring large range searchintervals RSI and short duration waveforms.  This presentation willhighlight the threedimensional imaging and camo penetration.655002, Session 1The angleanglerangeDoppler imaging AARDI ladarL. A. Jiang, J. Luu, D. R. Schue, MIT Lincoln Lab.The goal of the angleanglerangedoppler imaging ladar program is togreatly enhance the capability to do discrimination and precisionaimpoint selection on stressing midcourse ballistic missile defenseobjects.  Successful discrimination and aimpoint selection require aladar that is capable of both direct and coherent detection.  The AARDIladar is a flash ladar system that has this unique capability, able toswitch between the two detection modes with the same transmit andreceiver hardware.  The various laser measurement modalities are madepossible through the use of a 32 x 32 InGaAs Geigermode avalanchephotodiode array and a 1064nm flexible waveform laser.  In this paper,we introduce, explain, and demonstrate the idea of coherent photoncounting  a method of using arrays of photoncounting detectors fornearly shotnoiselimited coherent measurements.  The AARDI lasertransmitter is capable of generating laser pulses at 1 kHz repetition ratewith a pulse duration from 1 ns to 30 s at 100W average power levels.The short 1ns pulse is used for direct detection measurements and thepulse width can be lengthened to match the targets coherence lengthfor optimal use of photons for coherent measurements.  In addition, thetransmitter can also impress a biphaseshiftkeyed phasecode with 2ns chips onto the outgoing laser pulse for highresolution rangeDoppler measurements.  This paper contains an overview of thebrassboard system and recent measurement results in LincolnLaboratorys Active Range of the Optical Systems Test Facility.655003, Session 1Coherent ladar imaging of the SEASAT satellite retroreflector ringD. G. Youmans, SPARTA, Inc. J. M. Ceniceros, The Boeing Co.Coherent laser radar imaging of the SEASAT satellites retroreflectorring, as observed from a ground telescope, is analyzed.  Rangeresolved Doppler and intensity RRDI images of the retroring atmegameters of range are simulated.  The return strength of an individualcornercube is calculated, including atmospheric effects, and then theentire cornercube array return is simulated so that the interferenceeffects and image resolution both downrange and in frequency crossrange can be accurately analyzed.  A pulseburst waveform ladar isused to create the RRDI images following conventional ISARtechniques.  The coherent ladar may also have a flexible waveform, sopulsepair and binary phaseshift keying waveforms are also analyzed.BoeingSVS is currently testing the DST Ladar at the JPL OpticalCommunications Telescope Laboratory OCTL under a MDA  SMDCprogram.  Assuming these tests are successful and authorization isobtained, the theoretical image analysis will be compared with the datacollections.655004, Session 2Chirped amplitude modulation ladar for range andDoppler measurements and 3D imagingB. L. Stann, B. C. Redman, Army Research Lab.Shipboard infrared search and track IRST systems can detect seaskimming antiship missiles at long ranges. Since IRST systems cannotmeasure range and lineofsight velocity, they have difficultydistinguishing missiles from slowly moving false targets and clutter. In ajoint ArmyNavy program, the Army Research Laboratory ARL isdeveloping a chirped amplitude modulation ladar to provide range andvelocity measurements for tracking of targets handed over to it by thedistributed aperture system IRST DASIRST under development at theNaval Research Laboratory NRL under Office of Naval Research ONRsponsorship. By using an array receiver based on Intevac Inc.s ElectronBombarded Active Pixel Sensor EBAPS operating near 1.5   mwavelength, ARLs ladar also provides 3D imagery of potential threats insupport of the force protection mission. This year, ARL has furtherrefined our advanced breadboard ladar. This advanced breadboardincorporates the following improvements an orderofmagnitudeincrease in photocathode quantum efficiency, more uniform and greatermodulation depth across the chirp bandwidth, a more compact chirpgenerator, range resolution increase from 1 m to .5 m, improved thermalmanagement, quasirealtime data processing and display, quasirealtime image motion compensation, and a transmitter beam expanderwith a new design that eliminates spherical aberration induceddiffraction rings to produce a smoother illumination field. This paperdiscusses these improvements and presents the results of laboratoryand field tests with the advanced chirped AM ladar breadboard.655005, Session 2Multiscale target manifold characterization for 3Dimaging ladarE.

In thisinvestigation, ISOMAP is applied to 3D LADAR range imagery. Selectedmanmade objects are reduced to sets of spinimage feature vectorsthat describe object surface geometries. At various spinimage supportscales, we use a distributionfree test to quantify differences betweenmanmade objects in both the highdimensional spinimage vectorrepresentation and in the lowdimensional spinimage manifoldextracted using ISOMAP.655006, Session 2Dualband spacecraft sensor suite for lunar and smallbody landingB.

Accurate estimates of range, descent rate, attitude, and spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 115translational drift rate must be made to enable precision landings in lowgravity environments down to very low  1 cmsec drift velocities.Operational ranges are expected to range from a kilometer down to onemeter. Poorly characterized landing sites will require realtime obstacleavoidance and abort options. Although passive sensors are beingconsidered, active sensors enable the spacecraft designer to exploitmore optimal measurement techniques in which the illumination iscontrolled by design rather than accommodated by default. This paperaddresses the development and validation of a robust combination ofsensors, which reduce risks while minimizing impact on spacecraftmass and power. This paper will address the design, test, andevaluation of two technologies a miniature lidar and a millimeterwaveDoppler radar. A pulsed NdYAG lidar with a twoaxis scanner is coboresighted with a Kaband CW Doppler radar on a twoaxis gimbal,along with a MEMS inertial measurement unit and a data acquisition PCon a mobile testbed. Test results will be presented and discussed forconditions that emulate appropriate landing and proximity operations.Fixed test structures with corner reflector targets are used to validatethis approach and calibrate sensor sensitivity to different geometriesand kinematics. Guidance and control simulations for landing willultimately be validated with sensor models derived from these testsprior to instrument redesign and future fullscale tests.655007, Session 2Characterization of 3D imaging lidar for hazardavoidance and autonomous landing on the MoonD.

Uijt de Haag, A. Vadlamani, Ohio Univ.This paper discusses a precise navigation system for unmanned ormanned aerial vehicles over unknown or partially known terrainenvironments that integrates measurements from an InertialMeasurement Unit IMU with measurements from either a dual airbornelaser scanner system or a flash Ladar. The proposed system will be areliable alternative to the Global Positioning System GPS for areaswhere GPS is unavailable due to unintentional interference caused byatmospheric effects, interference from communication equipment, aswell as intentional jamming. It may also be used for autonomous lunaror martial landing systems.Two approaches are described in this paper, one approach using DualAirborne Laser Scanners DALS one pointing forward, one pointing aftand the other approach using an Airborne Flash Ladar AFL.Advantages and disadvantages of both approaches will be discussed.The proposed navigation system uses strapdown IMU measurements toestimate the aerial vehicle position and attitude and to georeferencethe sensor data. Then it uses the estimated maps from both the foreand aftpointing scanning Ladars or consecutive flash Ladar rangeframes to estimate the systematic IMU errors such as the position andvelocity drift errors.Results from an AFL and DALS simulator will be used to evaluate thesystem performance. The AFL and DALS simulators have beendeveloped at Ohio University and use real trajectory and attitudeprofiles from flight tests performed with Ohio Universitys DC3. Thepaper will furthermore include limited flight test results with OhioUniversitys DC3. At the current moment position accuracies at themeterlevel are achieved.655009, Session 2Use of 3D laser radar for navigation of unmanned aerialand ground vehicles in urban and indoor environmentsM. Uijt de Haag, D. Venable, M. Smearcheck, Ohio Univ.This paper discusses the integration of Inertial measurements withmeasurements from a threedimensional 3D imaging sensor forposition and attitude determination of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVand autonomous ground vehicles AGV in urban or indoorenvironments. To enable operation of UAVs and AGVs at any time in anyenvironment a Precision Navigation, Attitude, and Time PNATcapability is required that is robust and not solely dependent on theGlobal Positioning System GPS. In urban and indoor environments aGPS position capability may not only be unavailable due to shadowing,significant signal attenuation or multipath, but also due to intentionaldenial or deception. Although deep integration of GPS and InertialMeasurement Unit IMU data may prove to be a viable solution analternative method is being discussed in this paper.The alternative solution is based on 3D imaging sensor technologiessuch as Flash Ladar Laser Radar. Flash Ladar technology consists of amodulated laser emitter coupled with a focal plane array detector andthe required optics. Like a conventional camera this sensor  creates animage of the environment, but producing a 2D image where each pixelhas associated intensity vales the flash Ladar generates an imagewhere each pixel has an associated range and intensity value.Integration of flash Ladar with the attitude from the IMU allows creationof a 3D scene. Current lowcost Flash Ladar technology is capable ofgreater than 100 x 100 pixel resolution with 5 mm depth resolution at a30 Hz frame rate.The proposed algorithm first converts the flash Ladar measurements toa point cloud of the 3D environment using the IMU measurements, next,significant environmental features such as planar features walls, linefeatures or point features corners are extracted and associated fromone flash Ladar frame to the next. Finally, characteristics of thesefeatures such as the normal or direction vectors are used to computethe platform position and attitude changes. These delta position andattitudes are then used calibrate the IMU. Note, that the IMU is not onlyrequired to form the point cloud of the environment expressed in thenavigation frame, but also to perform association of the features fromone flash Ladar frame to the next.This paper will discuss the performance of the proposed system usingboth simulator data and data collected from a moving platform in anindoor environment. The former consists data from a simulated IMU andflash Ladar installed on an aerial vehicle for various trajectories throughan urban environment. The latter consists of measurements from aCSEM Swissranger 3D imaging sensor, a MicroStrain lowcost IMU, anda Honeywell MEMS IMU. Data was collected on both a ground vehicleand  a manually operated aerial vehicle inside the Ohio UniversitySchool of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science building.655010, Session 2Correlation between LIDAR reflux intensity and theaccuracy of the associated elevation informationG. Heidelmeyer, U. Klingauf, Technische Univ. Darmstadt GermanyDue to the growing demand of digital height information in the aviationdata sources providing a high degree of integrity have to beascertained. Especially for ground near operations e.g. helicoptermissions and autonomous operating aircrafts e.g. UAV the supply ofreliable terrain information is necessarily demanded. Beside INSARlaser scanning appears to be an appropriate data origin for theprovision of such high resolution height information.Normally terrain data DEM is related to the bare earth in order toobtain a Digital Terrain Model DTM. However to meet the specificrequirements for aviation purposes the elevation information should beprovided as a Digital Surface Model DSM representing the realsurface of the earth including all cover like vegetation and buildings. Butdue to the characteristics of active remote sensors the derived heightmodel always describes something in between the two elevationrepresentations.Conf. 6550 Laser Radar Technology and Applications XII116 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssTo guarantee the applicability of LIDAR elevation data in the aviation theTechnische Universitt Darmstadt TUD deals with the determination ofthe correlation between the degree of reflux intensity and thecorrectness of the provided height information. With the intention toimplement a procedure to prepare the LIDAR data for such specialconstraints, in addition to the determination of the impact of the refluxintensity the surface characteristics topography, terrain slope etc. willbe considered. By knowing the correlation between all the influencingfactors the LIDAR data will be enhanced to satisfy the needed integrityfor a dedicated aviation application.655011, Session 2Distributed aperture active imagingJ.

Pack, Utah State Univ.The validation process is crucial in measuring the value and accuracy ofa computer simulation.  These validation efforts become increasinglydifficult for simulations attempting to model random or interrelatedprocesses.  As explained in a previous publication, the USU LadarSIMsoftware package has recently been enhanced to include the modelingof Ladar beam footprints.  This paper will discuss the pertinent issuesinvolved in verifying the radiometric model of the simulation and presenta practical validation approach.In order to validate the complicated and interrelated processes, asystematic approach had to be developed.  Once all of the knownparameters were gathered, the variable parameters of the system weredetermined from simulation test scenarios.  This was done in a way toisolate as many variables as possible then build on the previouslyobtained results.  First, the appropriate voltage threshold levels of thediscrimination electronics were set by analyzing the number of falsealarms seen in actual data sets.  With this threshold set, the noise wasthen adjusted to achieve the appropriate number of dropouts.  Once asuitable system noise level was found, the range errors of the simulatedand actual data sets were compared and studied.Because of the importance of range errors, the validation of them wasanalyzed using two methods first by examining the range error of asurface with known reflectivity and second by examining the rangeerrors for specific detectors with known responsivities.  This gaveinsights into the discrimination method and receiver electronics used inthe actual system.655016, Session 3MRDF and BRDF measurements of low scatter materialsB. E. Walker, T. J. Papetti, C.

Charalampidis, Univ. of New Orleans K. Alphonso, Diamond DataSystems, Inc.Recent advances LIDAR technology have allowed rapid collection oftopography measurements over large areas. The LIDAR technology isbecoming an important approach for generating highresolution digitalterrain models. The highresolution advantage of the LIDAR technologyover other methods of data acquisition has made it important in severalapplications such as flood modeling and landslide prediction. In orderto generate a Digital Elevation Model DEM, measurements from nonground features such as manmade objects including buildings andvehicles, and vegetation have to be classified and removed. In thiswork, a novel algorithm has been implemented and tested. In general,most existing techniques do not use highly sophisticated methods forDEM generation, but they rather concentrate on simple approachessuch as interpolation methods and adaptive medianlike or slopebasedfilters. This work presents one of the few attempts that investigate thepossibility of using advanced features including multiscale and texturalfeatures for the development of an automatic technique. Someexperimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of theproposed method. Future work and extensions of the proposedtechnique are discussed.655024, Session 5TriDAR for obstacle detection inside aerosolX. Zhu, L. Gagnon, S. Gagnon, C. Smith, P. M. Church, NeptecDesign Group Ltd. CanadaThe ability to detect obstacles or ground inside an aerosol is a highlysoughtafter feature for numerous applications. Helicopter pilots need asensor to assist in a safe landing during whiteout conditions i.e. fog orsnow storm or brownout conditions, in which it is difficult for a pilot tosee obstacles or ground through the dense dust generated by thehelicopters rotorwash. In the upcoming NASA lunar landing and Marslanding missions, the exhaust plume and dust generated by rocketsalso causes issues for spaceships to land safely.Conventional LIDARs have been used to detect obstacles inside aerosolwith limited success. Although flash LIDARs or gated laser cameras canuse timingdiscrimination functions to suppress the signals fromaerosol, they generally dont have enough optical power to penetrateaerosol and to cover a reasonably large landing area. Conventionalscanning LIDARs need to have a coaligned launching beam andreturning beam before the scanning optics.  Consequentially, thereturning beam from a target is always imaged back on the receiverregardless of the range to target.  The scattering from aerosol in front ofa LIDAR window can saturate the receiver before any further signalprocessing can occur.Neptec TriDAR uses an autosynchronized optical design, which utilizesa triangulation relationship to control the amount of returning beamaccepted by the TOF timeofflight receiver as a function of targetrange.  The design also maintains this property during highspeedoptical scanning. As a result, TriDAR can suppress the return signalsfrom nearby aerosol scattering and, at the same time, have a sensitivityand dynamic range to detect obstacles or ground inside aerosol. In thispaper, TriDARs applications and results in obstacle detection inside anaerosol will be discussed.655025, Session 5Performance of laser penetration through forestvegetationT. R. Chevalier, O. K. Steinvall, H. Larsson, Swedish DefenceResearch Agency SwedenOne of the major advantages with laser sensors compared to passiveoptronic sensors, are their capability to penetrate sparse vegetation.Therefore, the most limiting performance issue is the portion of lasershots that are absorbed by the foliage. This issue is targeted in thispaper and an analysis of the effect of forest vegetation of Nordic type ispresented. The conclusions are based on laser scanner measurementas well as photos. While the analysis covers several elevation angles,the evaluation focuses on groundtoground measurements.655026, Session 5Identification of littoral targets with a laser range profilerJ. C. van den Heuvel, H. H. P. T. Bekman, F. J. M. van Putten, TNOFEL NetherlandsNaval operations in the littoral have to deal with threats at short range incluttered environments with both neutral and hostile targets. There is aneed to have a fast identification, which is possible with a laser rangeprofiler.A high bandwidth, fast laser receiver has been developed to performtests on the capability of a laser range profiler for identification. Typerise and fall times are 2 nanosec.The experimental results were compared with simulated range profilesbased on 3D target models. It is shown that seasurface targets can bedistinguished from their range profiles. The influence on theidentification performance of range resolution and apriori knowledge ofthe aspect angle is presented. By scanning the laser beam in theazimuth direction a 2D image with a low lateral and a highrangeresolution is obtained. This 1.5D image gives an improvedidentification performance especially for sideview images.Conf. 6550 Laser Radar Technology and Applications XII118 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssClassification algorithms have been tested on simulated range profilesand 1.5D images of a number of small boats.

Ullrich, N.

Wepresent field data to demonstrate the superiority of fullwaveformanalysis data over conventional laser data in postprocessing.655027, Session 6Container integrity verification using laser triangulationA. Busboom, V. Sequeira, Joint Research Ctr. ItalyWe propose a system for verifying the integrity of containers using atriangulation based laser line scanner, with applications in the field ofnuclear containment verification. Our approach is based on theassumption that any intrusion into the container shell and subsequentreconstruction of the surface will inevitably leave slight changes to thesurface shape. Even if the changes may not visible to the human eye,the proposed system can detect them by comparing the surface map ofthe container to a previously acquired reference.A 3D reference of the entire container surface is acquired by fusingmultiple scans from different viewpoints. Subsequently, scans ofarbitrary parts of the surface can be made and compared against thereference.We address two specific problems in detail Firstly, in order to make thesystem lightweight and portable, the scanner is mounted on aturntable on top a tripod and the scanner is panned while acquiring thescan. The range data needs to be remapped to a global 3D coordinateframe which requires the exact knowledge of the position andorientation of the panning axis with respect to the scanner coordinateframe. We propose an autocalibration procedure which involvesscanning a planar calibration target, e.g. a coated glass pane. Thecalibration algorithm uses nonlinear optimization techniques in order tofind the parameter set which results in a maximally planar surface afterthe 3D remapping. We show that this calibration procedure is robust,accurate and easy to use in the field.Secondly, we discuss the registration of scans against the reference. Ina first step, the coarse position of the verification scan on the typicallymuch larger reference scan needs to be determined. We propose amethod based on the automated selection and correspondence searchof feature points such as dents or intersection of welds. In a secondstep, the registration is refined using the wellknown Iterative ClosestPoints ICP algorithm.We present results using steel and concrete casks which demonstratethat our calibration and registration procedures yield sufficient accuracyto detect intrusions which cannot be visibly perceived.655029, Session 6A lowcost multistatic, networked approach to 3D ladarfor surveillanceY. Wang, B. Hu, H. Q. Le, Univ. of HoustonA concept for 3D ladar for surveillance, intrusion detection, and accesscontrol of a facility is described. The essence is a nonconventionalsystem architecture that consists of i multistatic configuration with anarbitrarily scalable number of transmitters Txs and receivers Rxs thatform an optical wireless codedivisionmultipleaccess CDMA network,and ii flexible system architecture with modular plugandplaycomponents that can be deployed for any facility with arbitrary topology.Affordability is a driving consideration. A key feature for low system costis an asymmetric use of many inexpensive Rxs in conjunction with fewerTxs, which are generally more expensive. The Rxs are spatiallydistributed close to the surveyed area for large coverage, and capable ofreceiving signals from Txs with moderate laser power, which is alsocrucial for affordability. There are two unique features of the networkapproach that are distinctive from the nonnetwork approach. The systemproduces sensing information that scales as NxM, where N, M are thenumber of Txs and Rxs, as opposed to linear scaling N in a nonnetworked system. Also, for target positioning, besides laser pointingdirection and timeofflight, the algorithm includes multiple pointofviewinmage fusion and triangulation for enhanced accuracy, which is notapplicable to nonnetworked monostatic ladars. Scaledmodelexperiments with lowpower semiconductor lasers and theoreticalsimulation were performed. Results on multiple pointofview images andfusion for entire scene reconstruction are described. Applicationconcepts for surveillance, intrusion detection, and access control are alsodiscussed.655030, Session 6Detection of small seasurface targets with a search lidarJ. C. van den Heuvel, H. H. P. T. Bekman, F. J. M. van Putten, TNOFEL NetherlandsNaval operations in the littoral have to deal with the treat of small seatargets, which are difficult to detect with radar. These targets have a lowradar crosssection and low velocity which makes them hard to detect byradar. Typical threats include Jet Skies, FIACs, and speedboats.Lidar measurements at the coast of the Netherlands have shown a verygood signal to clutter ratio with respect to buoys located up to 10 kmfrom the shore were the lidar system was situated. The lidar clutter ismuch smaller than the radar clutter due to the smoothness of the seasurface for optical wavelengths, thus almost all laser light is scatteredaway from the receiver. These results show that due to the low clutter asearch lidar is feasible that can detect small seasurface targets.The concept of a search lidar is presented and its performance is derivedfrom system models. By using a high reprate laser and a variable beamdivergence the search time can be limited. The design of a search lidarbased on a commercially available high power and high reprate laser isshown.

Boris, Naval Research Lab.The fluid dynamics of airflow through a city controls the transport anddispersion of airborne contaminants. This is a problem of urbanaerodynamics rather than of meteorology. The average flow, largescalefluctuations and turbulence are closely coupled to the building geometry.Buildings create large roostertail wakes there are systematic fountainflows up the backs of tall buildings and dust in the wind also movesperpendicular to or even against the locally prevailing wind. Requirementsfor better prediction accuracy demand timedependent, threedimensionalCFD computations that include solar heating and buoyancy, completelandscape and building geometry specification including foliage and,realistic wind fluctuations.  This fundamental prediction capability isnecessary to assess urban visibility and lineofsight sensor performanceis street canyons and rugged terrain.Computing urban aerodynamics accurately is clearly a timedependentHigh Performance Computing problem. In an emergency, on the otherhand, prediction technology to assess light propagation and sensorperformance in the face of industrial spills, transportation accidents, orterrorist attacks has very tight time requirements that suggest simpleapproximations which produce inaccurate results. In the past we havehad to choose one or the other a fast, inaccurate model or a slowaccurate model. Using new fluiddynamic principles, an urbanorientedemergency assessment system called CTAnalyst was invented thatsolves this dilemma. It produces HPCquality results for airbornecontaminant scenarios nearly instantly and has unique new capabilitiessuited to sensor optimization.  This presentation treats the design and useof CTAnalyst and discusses the developments needed for widespreaduse with advanced sensor and communication systems.655102, Session 1Predicting radiance obscuration during a high altitudenuclear event using the advanced systems survivabilityintegrated simulation toolkit ASSISTM. A. Johnson, M. Hopkins, S. Sokolsky, The Aerospace Corp.A parametric look at the radiance effects to be encountered, spatially andtemporally, of high altitude nuclear events HANE on lasercommunications in the 15 um range is presented.  The radiance from ahigh altitude nuclear event is an optical obscurant and will effect thepropagation of Laser energy  communications systems.  The spatial andtemporal radiance effects are wavelength dependent.  The investigationuses the NORSE and SCENARIO components of the Advanced SystemsSurvivability Integrated Simulation Toolkit ASSIST from the DefenseThreat Reduction Agency DTRA to explore, through modeling andsimulation, the radiance effects of a 1 Megaton Nuclear event occurring at100 km altitude as seen from above the event by a sensor placed at35,786 km altitude.  ASSIST is a DTRA validated toolkit for performingnuclear effects modeling , simulation, and analysis based upon firstprinciple physics and chemistry, and data garnered from actual atomictests.  In addition, a comparison and contrast of the SCENARIO andNORSE tools for performing similar analyses with like inputs is presented.Simulation results of the SCENARIO and NORSE tools provide a look atthe capability of the ASSIST toolkit to predict radiance obscuration effectsthat would be encountered by optical communications systems during ahigh altitude nuclear event U.655103, Session 1Worldwide estimates and uncertainty assessments of laserpropagation for diverse geometries for paths in the altituderegime of 24 km and below at wavelengths 0.355 to 14 mS.

HELEEOS is anchored to respected wave optics codesand all significant degradation effectsincluding optical turbulence andmolecular, aerosol, and liquid water dropdroplet absorption andscatteringare represented in the model.  Beam spread effects due tothermal blooming caused by the various absorbers are consideredwhen appropriate.  Strehl Ratio is the primary performance metric usedin the study, with results presented in the form of histograms.The expected performance of laser systems operating at powers fromlow 1 W to high  500 kW power is assessed at approximately 20wavelengths between 0.355 um to 14 um for a number of widelydispersed land and maritime locations worldwide.  Scenarios evaluatedinclude both up and down looking generally oblique engagementgeometries over ranges up to 9000 meters in which anticipated clear airaerosols and thin layers of fog, light rain, various cloud types, andbattlefield obscurants occur.

Sluss, Jr., Univ. of OklahomaFree Space Optics FSO Technology is currently in use to solve the lastmile problem in telecommunication systems by offering higherbandwidth than wired or wireless connections when optical fiber is notavailable.  Incorporating mobility into FSO technology can contribute togrowth in its utility.  Tracking and alignment are two big challenges formobile FSO communications.  In this paper, we present a theoreticalapproach for mobile FSO Networks between Unmanned Aerial VehiclesUAVs, manned aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles.  We introducetracking algorithms for achieving Line of Sight LOS connectivity andpresent analytical results.  Two scenarios are studied in this paper  1 An unmanned aerial surveillance vehicle, the Global Hawk, with astationary ground vehicle, an M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank, and 2  amanned aerial surveillance vehicle, the E3A Airborne Warning andControl System AWACS, with an unmanned combat aerial vehicle, theJoint Unmanned Combat Air System JUCAS.  After initial vehiclelocations have been coordinated, the tracking algorithm will steer thegimbals to maintain connectivity between the two vehicles and allowhighspeed communication to occur.

C. Wiltse, Georgia Institute of TechnologyAtmospheric attenuation is one of the most significant factors in limitingthe performance of millimeterwave and terahertz systems.  Althoughatmospheric propagation is fairly well understood up to 1 THz, majorerrors have been published in numerous locations showing atmosphericpropagation at frequencies from 10 GHz to 1 THz.  Some of these errorshave been reported in the past by the present author.  The topic wasalso reviewed in an invited plenary presentation by H. Bruce Wallace atthe 2006 SPIE Defense and Security Symposium in Orlando.  Threecases are discussed here, two for clearair conditions and one for fog.In one example, the attenuation at 4 km elevation has been mislabeledas 9150 m or 30,000 feet for the 10 to 400 GHz range.  This error hasappeared in several journal articles, vendors catalogs, shortcoursenotes, and a recentlypublished book.  In a second case the attenuationpeak near 22.3 GHz due to water vapor absorption has been plotted at20 GHz.  The third case deals with an error pertaining to attenuation infog for frequencies between 10 and 1000 GHz.  Specific informationand corrections will be given for all three cases.  The net result of theseerrors is that development of sensor and communications applicationshas been impeded because the errors usually make atmospheric lossesappear to be greater than they really are.655106, Session 2Comparison of near to mid infrared 0.9  10m laserpropagation through the New York City metro areaP. A. Corrigan, R. Martini, E. Whittaker, Stevens Institute ofTechnology C. Gmachl, Princeton Univ.Low power midIR laser light exhibits exceptionally less attenuation inpropagation though the New York metro area when compared to nearIR wavelengths. Depending on the type of atmospheric extinction werecord a gain factor of up to eight in the BeersLaw exponentialcoefficient for midIR light compared to nearIR, thereby increasingdeployable range and SNR of current communication systems bysignificant orders of true magnitude.We present transmission data from a collinear, coaxial, multiwavelength laser test bed spanning 0.9  10 microns through seasonalatmospheric conditions including most fog types, rain, snow, mist aswell as other aerosols.This is achieved using lasers with average power ranging from a fewmilliwatts midIR QCL to tens of milliwatts which have beennormalized under lockin detection over a 500 m free space optical linkacross the Stevens Institute of Technology campus.We also present corroborating results from an indoor fog experimentsimulating various fog conditions. Here we have also deconstructedBeers attenuation coefficient and realized the contribution of scatteringand absorption separately with a purposebuilt polar nephelometer.Using Rayleigh  Mie predictions we correctly determine and measurethe extent by which a midIR system scatters light less under fog than atraditional nearIR one. We hence account for the performanceenhancement in the metroair test bed.655107, Session 2Minimization of acquisition time in a wavelengthdiversified FSO link between mobile platformsA. Harris, Univ. of North FloridaFreespace optical FSO communication links are envisioned as aviable option for the provision of temporary highbandwidthcommunication links between moving platforms, such as a groundstation and an unmanned aerial vehicle.  One of the limitations of FSOlinks is the transmission of laser beams through various weatherphenomena.  One technique to attempt to overcome the effects ofweather, such as fog, is to implement a wavelength diversity schemebetween the FSO transmitter and receiver.  This paper investigates theminimization of link acquisition times using a wavelength diversityscheme between mobile FSO platforms.  The wavelength diversityscheme consists of three different wavelengths, 1.55 m, 0.85 m and10 m.  Each wavelength has different advantages and disadvantagesfor transmission depending of prevalent weather conditions andatmospheric turbulence conditions.  A detailed simulation analysis ofthe transmission properties of the wavelength diversity schemes will bepresented.  Based on the transmission properties, a method forminimizing link acquisition times through the exploitation of variousproperties of each wavelength is presented and analyzed.  Thetransmission property analysis includes the effects of atmosphericproperties on the link power and the effects of atmospheric turbulenceon the link.  Further analysis to investigate the viability of thewavelength diversity scheme to improve FSO tracking between movingplatforms is also presented.655108, Session 3PDF model for uplink to space in the presence of beamwanderL.

Four laser beams were transmitted from theoptical ground station to the OICETS satellite in order to reduce theintensity fluctuation of the optical signal due to atmospheric turbulence.The optical scintillation as a function of the number of beams and thefrequency response are measured.

J. Baker, K. R. Bock, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Ctr.Recent work has shown that a Gaussian beam turbulent propagationregion exists where the observed random irradiance fluctuations areweak but follow a nonlog normal probability distribution G.J. Baker,JOSA A 23, 2006, p 395.  This region has been named the D1 region,and includes such examples as focused beams on horizontal paths andcollimated beams on ground to space paths.  Within the D1 region, loworder turbulence effects dominate the beam irradiance behavior and areresponsible for the departure from the log normal statistics typicallyobserved in weak fluctuation conditions.  In addition, predictionsderived from the Rytov perturbation method are inaccurate within theD1 region, since they are built upon the implicit assumption of lognormal irradiance behavior.The previously cited JOSA paper presented analytic arguments thatdefined and bounded the D1 scintillation region, yet space limitationsrestricted the amount of simulation data that could be included.  Thistalk presents additional simulation data that serves to further verify andanchor the analytic predictions of the prior JOSA paper.  The simulationdata is derived from an independent wave optics simulation of beampropagation through atmospheric turbulence, built upon the splitstepnumerical solution of the governing stochastic Helmholtz equation.655114, Session 4A new marine atmospheric spectrum for laserpropagationK.

In this paper we developstatistics for atmospheric propagation in marine environments.  Anatmospheric index of refraction power spectrum specifically tailored tothe marine environment is developed and used in scintillation theory inthe weak fluctuation regime. With experimental data taken in a maritimeenvironment, the theoretical scintillation values from both marine andterrestrial theories are compared with experimental values. From this,the necessity of a marine model is discussed.655115, Session 4Angle of arrival fluctuations for free space laser beampropagation through non Kolmogorov turbulenceI. Toselli, Politecnico di Torino Italy L. C. Andrews, R. L. Phillips,Univ. of Central Florida V.

Wood, GeorgiaTech Research InstituteThe Georgia Tech Research Institute GTRI has developed a new type ofLIDAR system for monitoring slantpath profiles of atmospheric refractiveturbulence. The LIDAR makes realtime measurements by projecting alaser beam to form a laser beacon at several successive altitudes. Thebeacon is observed with a multipleaperture telescope and differentialmotion of the beacon images from each altitude is characterized by avariance, as in the astronomical Differential Image Motion MonitorDIMM, which uses natural stars as sources. Whereas the DIMM onlyprovides one number, r0, to characterize the entire atmosphere, aninversion algorithm has been developed for the LIDAR to retrieve theturbulence profile.

H. Tofsted, D. Quintis, S. OBrien, J. Yarbrough, M.

This experiment intercomparedsix active imager systems operating in the visible, nearinfrared, andshortwave infrared sensing bands.  The objective was to populate adatabase suitable for model validation of simulations of active systemoperation.  For this experiment eight scintillometers were arrangedalong or near the atmospheric path to characterize the vertical andtemporal structure of scintillation and inner scale.  A met mast, two 32m met towers, and an 8m tower complemented the scintillometer data.This report focuses on acquisition and analysis of data from four of thescintillometers arranged in pairs along the 2km propagation path.

W. Lukesh, S. Chandler, Nukove Scientific Consulting, LLCGroundtospace laser illumination experiments with the goal ofobtaining reflected energy with a large aperture, such as those at theAMOS Facility on Maui or Starfire Optical Range on Kirtland AFB, aresubject to several disturbances. Energy requirements dictate that thelaser beam at the target must have a fullwidthhalfmaximum FWHMas small as several microradians. This in turn dictates the requirementfor exceptional pointing. Two major disturbances are known as jitter arandom shottoshot error and boresight a static offset due to opticalmisalignment.For a decade the authors have investigated nonimaging statisticaltechniques for estimating system pointing based solely on the receivedtimeseries signal. The technique easily extends to crude but usefultarget size and shape identification without imaging. These results havebeen presented at SPIE and EOS Conferences and at the Institute forAtmospheric Optics Tomsk, Russia.Two additional potentially deleterious effects are target speckle anddownlink scintillation. Speckle is the result of the illumination of anoptically rough Lambertian surface and the subsequent interference ofthe coherent laser on the return path. This can prove to have a criticalimpact for an imaging system. Scintillation is caused by the atmosphereduring the downlink.The nonimaging nature of the authors techniques, combined with thelarge receiving aperture, on the order of 3.5m at the two experimentfacilities, largely mitigates the impact of these two effects due toaperture averaging.  This paper demonstrates the success of theauthors pointing estimation technique in the presence of speckle andscintillation.655122, Session 6Mitigating angular misalignment from atmosphericeffects in FSO linksP. G. LoPresti, Univ. of Tulsa H. Refai, J. J.

This paper theoreticallystudies the effective angular misalignment that can be caused by suchdeflections and mitigation methods for a traditional freespace opticallink.  The theory uses Gaussian beam propagation to determine theoptical power distribution at the receiver lens and the position of thebeam at the lens focal point. Scintillation effects are simulated usingcommercial software packages.  oordinate transformation is used toassist in calculating the amount of power collected by the lens andincident on the collecting core of the fiber.  The use of adaptive powerand divergence schemes are investigated as possible methods forreducing the receiver sensitivity to misalignment.  The simulation resultsshow that some reduction in misalignment sensitivity, though additionalmeasures are likely required.655123, Session 6Patching Cn2 time series data holes using principalcomponent analysisM.

Crabtree, Air Force Research Lab.The atmosphere presents a significant challenge for many electrooptical systems.  Attenuation, scattering, clouds, thermal blooming, andturbulence are all potential obstacles to system performance.  For thisresearch, turbulence is the sole atmospheric distortion investigated.Atmospheric turbulence can be described by random fluctuations in thevelocity of nearly homogeneous patches of air existing in a continuumof sizes.  The chaotic mixing of these atmospheric cells leads to arandom distribution of air temperature and pressure, and thereforerefractive index.  The resulting phase distortions imposed on wavefrontstraveling through the atmosphere are termed optical turbulence.Extended turbulence and challenging engagement scenarios also leadto amplitude fluctuations, which are sensed as intensity variations bythe human eye and optical detectors.Traditional turbulence compensation systems a.k.a., adaptive opticsmodify optical phase in the pupil plane to improve the focal plane imageor increase energy on target in the far field.  This work investigatesphase modulation in the focal plane.  For highenergy laser applications,focal plane phase modulation is not desirable due to extremely highpower densities and device damage thresholds.  However, LaserComsystems aim to use as little power as possible for reasons such as eyesafety and covert communication.  Thus, phase modulation in the focalplane is a reasonable approach for this application.  This workinvestigates focal plane phase modulation for increasing single modefiber coupling efficiency and decreasing biterror rate.  Potentialbenefits of phase modulation in the focal plane are considered, such asnovel application of existing hardware to realtime systems.Conf. 6551 Atmospheric Propagation IV124 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655125, Session 7Fiber bundles in transceivers to mitigate scintillationeffects on freespace optical networksP.

Brooks,Univ. of TulsaAccuracy of alignment is a key factor for successfully establishing andmaintaining connections in networks of freespace optical links, and isparticularly critical when one or both of the transceivers are moving.Scintillation and other atmospheric effects create beam deflections thatfurther complicate the alignment process.  This paper studies the use ofa fiberoptic bundle at the transmitter and receiver to mitigate theatmospheric effects on the link uptime.  The bundle at the transmitterallows fast, nonmechanical steering of beam to track and correct forrelative motion.  The bundle at the receiver allows for a significantimprovement in misalignment tolerance, particularly to angularmisalignment.  Laboratory experiments and theoretical analyses wereconducted on a freespace link to determine the interrelationshipbetween spacing of the fibers within the bundle, the focal lengths of thetransceiver lenses, the beam deflection angle, and the misalignmenttolerance for varying atmospheric conditions.  A shorter focal lengthlens at the transmitter provides greater coverage, while a moderatefocal length lens at the receiver reduces the bundle size required toimprove misalignment tolerance. A smaller overall system size ispossible, provided that sufficient power is used to overcome the greaterspatial spreading and subsequent loss of peak power at the receiver.655126, Session 7Omnidirectional freespace optical FSO receiversH.

Additionally, the study presents viableoptical beam steering and capturing mechanism to allow fast trackingand accurate pointing between two transceivers of freespace opticFSO link which required continuous alignment.

H. Lee, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Ctr.In multiconjugate adaptive optics MCAO, multiple wavefrontcorrectors and wavefront sensors are arranged to control phenomenathat often limit the performance of conventional singleconjugateadaptive optics SCAO.  One favored paradigm applies tomography toenable widerFOV imaging, while another applies field conjugationprinciples to reduce sensitivity to monochromatic scintillation.  Suchsetups are appearing in advanced adaptive optics AO systems andexperiments.With few exceptions, existing MCAO field conjugation schemes arebased on explicit beam shaping.  They thus require direct measurementand feedback control of beam irradiance profiles.  They also rely onnumerically sensitive, computationally intensive, andor optically lossyinversemodel control algorithms based on phase retrieval, intensitytransport, modulation, et al.This paper presents some decentralized MCAO approaches to closedloop field conjugation.  In these, irradiance measurement and feedbackare not needed wavefront sensors and correctors sense and actuaterelative phase only, and control algorithms are no more complex than inconventional SCAO.  Control of relative amplitude is thus implicit ratherthan explicit, yet the performance against slowly varying weakscintillation is provably asymptotically optimal in a minimumvariancesense.  Barchers full wave conjugation method is one such approach.Given standard assumptions such as firstorder Rytov perturbation andsingle scattering, such MCAO field conjugation systems are quiteamenable to linear dynamical systems modeling.  Modern controltheory provides stability criteria and spatiotemporal transfer functionsfor the closedloop system.  Scalable meansquare error metricsexcluding reconstruction errors then arise by analytical andornumerical integration.  System performance and model fidelity in weakand strong regimes are explored using closedloop waveopticsimulations.655131, Session 7Image processing techniques for optical sensing througha disturbed airwater interfaceE.

GermanyThere is an increasing need for the generation of midinfrared radiationin the 3 to 5micron region especially in the absorption minima of theatmospheric windows. Recent advents of heat seeking detectorsoperating in these atmospheric windows make it necessary to developcompact and reliable midinfrared laser systems that can be installed inairborne platforms.

Soules,Lawrence Livermore National LabDuring this past year, the Solid State Heat Capacity Laser SSHCL hasdemonstrated a significant increase in performance.  In addition,numerous lasermaterial interaction experiments were conducted usingthe SSHCL, providing new insight on how effective a laser weapon maybe on a real target.  Both of these topics will be the subject of thispaper.The SSHCL have demonstrated 2X diffraction limit beam quality for 4and 5 second run times.  These experimental results show that the heatcapacity laser concept for a solidstate laser is indeed viable and canprovide the performance coupled with simple, straightforwardarchitecture to be seriously considered for use in a battlefieldenvironment.  Discussion of how and why this improved laserperformance was attained and how this scales to power levels of 100kW or more will be addressed.  The use of ceramic laser gain media iskey to this success story.In addition, our ability to conduct 25 kW lasermaterial interactionexperiments for up to 10 seconds of run time, with spot sizes up to 16cm by 16 cm square, and air flow speeds at 100 meterssecondenables us to pursue a lethality phase space previously unattainable.The 200 Hz pulse repetition rate and the 1 micron wavelength arecharacteristics of the SSHCL that enhance the usefulness of theexperiments due to its relevancy to a battlefield ready solid state lasersystem.655205, Session 1The reflective properties of a volume Bragg gratingexposed to a high power laser beamH. Shu, M. A. Bass, College of Optics  PhotonicsUniv. of CentralFloridaThe material in which a volume Bragg grating is made will always havesome absorption at the gratings design wavelength.  Thus, whenexposed to a high power laser beam the grating will absorb somepower, be heated such that a temperature gradient is formed and,consequently, become distorted.  We developed an accurate model tocalculate the reflection of a high power laser beam by a volume Bragggrating that experiences such distortion.  We used the finite differencebeam propagation method and an iteration method to account for thecounter propagation of the laser beam in the volume Bragg grating.  Weestablished a new formulation of the wave equation to include thedistortion of the grating structure.  The surface distortion andtemperature induced index change are not new problems and havebeen dealt with before.  This new formulation that accounts for thegrating structure distortion has been validated in our work to be correctand very accurate.  We applied our numerical model to calculate thereflection of a high power laser beam by a distorted generic volumeBragg grating which has large grating strength.  Our calculation predictsthat grating structure distortion could introduce significant changes ofboth the phase and intensity patterns of the reflected laser beam.Understanding such changes is critical to the application of volumeBragg grating to high power laser systems.655206, Session 1A silicon carbide face cooled ceramic NdYAG laserG.

Lee, H. E. Meissner, Onyx Optics Inc.The thermal conductivity of CVD diamond with about 1825 Wcm.K atroom temperature is one of the properties that make diamond a uniquematerial, with copper a distant second at about 15 the value.  Sincethermal management of solid state lasers is becoming an everincreasing hurdle to scale up to high average power, CVD diamond is anideal heat spreader to conduct heat away to a heat sink.  At the sametime, diamond is transparent between 230nm to the far infrared, withtwophonon absorption bands between 2.5 and 6 m.Adhesivefree bonding AFBr of CVD diamond sheet has beendemonstrated to be possible because Van der Waals attractive forcesconstitute the principal bonding mechanism of AFBr composites.  Thecoefficient of thermal expansion of CVD diamond is with 0.8 1.0x106C much lower than any of the common solid state laser media, withYAG being about 8.2x106C.  The nonlocalized nature of Van derWaals bonds allows almost perfect stress equilibration withoutdelamination, while any other bonding technique would be expected toresult in highly stressed composites.Bonding mechanisms, experimental observation of stress relief andparameters for successful AFBr CVD diamond single crystalcomposites without or with optical coatings at the interface will bereported, with relevance for disk, slab and waveguide solid state lasergeometries at ambient and cryogenic temperatures.655208, Session 2Progress in NdYAG ceramic laserA.

Advanced ceramictechnology enables the direct formation of composite laser elementwith complex structures.Since the composite laser media using single crystal such as NdYAGand YAG was reported in 1998 1, the composites with variousstructures have been extensively implemented. However, conventionalbonding of composite elements is not sufficient for some laserapplications, and fabrication process is complex and has long overallprocessing time. We successfully fabricated allceramic compositeelement using simple ceramic processing without polishing anddiffusion bonding for the first time.2 Laser Performance of Polycrystal and Single Crystal NdYAG bySintering ProcessWe report the first demonstration of polycrystalline Nddoped YAGceramics with almost perfect porefree structure and Nddoped YAGsingle crystal fabricated by advanced ceramic processing.

Shaw,S. S. Bayya, Naval Research Lab. B. Sadowski, Sachs FreemanAssociates, Inc. R. E. Miklos, Naval Research Lab.Lightweight and compact high power lasers are needed for severaldefense applications. While freeelectron lasers and chemical lasers arecapable of high output powers, they are too bulky, toxic and thereforeimpractical for applications which require mobility and agility. On theother hand solid state lasers based on crystals offer great promise dueto their compact size, but are limited to a select number of crystalcompositions that can be grown without running into high temperaturegrowth issues which limit size and quality. Consequently, crystalmaterials that have better properties as a laser host, such as a highthermal conductivity, cannot be grown in good quality. One example isYbY2O3 which has a higher thermal conductivity and significantlylower quantum defect than NdYAG. However, it is difficult to grow largecrystals due to its high melting point of 2400oC and phase transition at 2200oC. The high melt temperature leads to crucible interactions andvolatilization, while the phase transition leads to additional strain whichcauses cracking and limits the crystal to mm scale sizes. However, wehave developed a low temperature process to make high purityYbY2O3 powder containing up to 10Yb, and then sinter it to atransparent ceramic. This process overcomes the limitations oftraditional crystal growing. We will report on the physical and opticalproperties of the ceramic and demonstrate laser oscillation in thismaterial.655210, Session 2Domestically produced ceramic YAG laser gain materialfor high power SSLsJ.

The systemconsists of a single laser and 2 nonlinear crystals.  With a novel design,the laser produces synchronous, collinear, Qswitched output at 2widely separated wavelengths. Because both pulses are created in thesame laser, mixing is as easy as second harmonic generation.

Individual disks are pumped from oppositesides using 200 micron core fiber sources, each capable of providing 35W of pump power at 939 nm. Cryogenicallycooled crystalline solidstate lasers, and YbYAG lasers in particular, are attractive sources ofscalable CW output power with very high wallplug efficiency andexcellent beamquality that is independent of the output power. Thedevice we have demonstrated produces a  neardiffractionlimitedTEM00 output beam and is cooled using a liquid nitrigen circulator. Inaddition, the device can be scaled to very high average power in aMOPA configuration, by increasing the number and diameter of the thindisks, and by increasing the power of the individual diodes used topump the disks.During this talk we will review the thermal and optical benefits ofcryogenicallycooling solidstate lasers , review our YbYAG cryogeniclaser design and discuss its scalability, and will present experimentalresults including output power, slope and point efficienies, and beamquality.655213, Session 3High brightnesstemperature microlasersT.

From the point of view of brightnesstemperature, singleaxial and transverse mode mega watt level laser beam has extremelyhighcoherency to cause any reaction upon the materials. In this talk,wed like to discuss about the possibility without any amplificationsystem. Even if the standalone microlaser configuration, thebrightnesstemperature could be up to 2x1020K with the 16 mWelectrical average power supply.  This value is already 1016 timeshigher than that of the Sun, 6,000K.

Wide temperature operation of compact NdYAG laser wasachieved by end pumping and use of multiwavelength diode stacks.Such lasers enabled construction of fully operational 4.7 lb laserdesignator prototype generating 50 mJ pulse at 1020 Hz PRF.Approaches for increasing the energy output of such compact sourceswill be presented.  Eyesafe 1.5 um lasers based on low PRF 0.3 Hzflashpumped Monoblock lasers, have enabled compact STORMrange finders that have been recently put into fullscale production tomeet Armys current and future needs.  For higher PRF applications,such as flash imaging, improvements in such lasers have been madethrough the use of diode endpumping and unstable laser cavitydesigns.  These approaches made it possible to achieve high electricalefficiency, PRFs in the 1020 Hz range, wide temperature operation 20to 50 deg.C, and shortening of the Qswitched laser pulses to 2 ns.Compared with bulk compact solid state lasers, fiber laser arecharacterized by lower pulse energy, higher PRFs, shorter pulses andhigher electrical efficiency.

W.Henderson, Lockheed Martin Coherent TechnologiesWe report an eyesafe diffractionlimited singlefrequency 1617 nmErYAG laser transmitter, developed for coherent laser radarapplications.  The transmitter utilizes a master oscillator  poweramplifier architecture, enabling the production of high peak poweroutput.  The pulsed oscillator is Qswitched and cavitydumped,resulting in a 1.1 ns pulsewidth.  The pulsed oscillator is injectionseeded by a commercial 1617 nm CW distributed feedback laser diode,resulting in single longitudinal mode output.  The oscillator and amplifierare directly pumped into the ErYAG laser upper state by commercialdiodepumped CW 1533 nm Yb,Erdoped fiber lasers.  The injectionseeded pulsed oscillator produces an average output power of 2.1 W at10 kHz pulse repetition frequency PRF with a pulsewidth of 1.1 ns0.19 MW peak power with a beam quality 1.1 times the diffractionlimit.  The oscillator has a slope efficiency of 47 in the CW mode, anda conversion efficiency of 80 from CW mode to injectionseededpulsed mode.  The power amplifier produces 10 W in the CW mode and4.7 W in the pulsed mode at 10 kHz PRF with 1.1 ns pulsewidth 0.43MW peak power.  The Fourier transform of the heterodyne signal of thepulsed oscillator output has a width of 0.42 MHz, which is consistentwith the transform limit of 0.40 MHz for a Gaussian pulse with theobserved 1.1 ns pulsewidth of the heterodyne signal.655217, Session 4A 100mJ Qswitched 1645nm ErYAG laserS.

We generate 55 mJ of Qswitched output at 10 Hzfrom a 6mmlong, 2mmdiameter 0.5ErYAG rod with a 50Routput mirror.  The pump diodes and focusing system launch 210 Wpeak into the rod for a 7ms duration.  The average Qswitchedpulsewidth is 32ns 1.7 MW peak and the measured beam quality isM21.2 with a 50R.  In a similar experiment we measured 26 mJ  10ns pulses 2.6 MW peak at 10Hz from a shorter oscillator cavity.

Hogenboom, Textron Systems Corp.Erbium doped YAG is an intriguing laser material which lases directly at1645nm when pumped at either 1473nm or 1532nm, all of which are inthe eyesafe band.  However, a laser made from this material is notparticularly straightforward to design.  ErYAG is a quasithreelevelsystem, which leads to strong temperature dependence.  Perhaps moreimportantly, a strong upconversion process, which is dopantconcentration dependent, effectively produces a pump intensitydependence in the saturation intensity and other laser parameters.

Very good, but arguably practical, results are obtainedwith fiber laserpumped ErYAG, but directly diodepumped ErYAGlasers are currently under development.  Major development areas arepower scaling, beam quality as well as overall conversion efficiency.Here we report the results of our diodepumped ErYAG laser powerscaling effort using the hybrid stableunstable cavity, which resulted inhighest, to our knowledge, QCW power of 130W with the beam qualityof M2  1.28 in stable direction and M2  1.1 in unstable direction.Also reported are dramatic improvements in the overall conversionefficiency of a CW ErYAG DPSSL achieved by implementing volumeBragg gratings for narrowing the InGaAsPInP 10diode bar stack pumpspectrum in order to achieve the inline pumping of Er3. We used anEr0.5YAG slab with dimensions 60x2.5x15 mm3 Inbonded towatercooled copper heatsink for CW operation. With an optical pathlength for pumping radiation of 15 mm, only 37 of 1530 nm radiationwas absorbed by the slab using direct output from the pump stack.With the volume Bragg grating between the pump diode stack and theErYAG slab, the absorption of the pumping radiation increased to 62.As a result, the incident threshold power was reduced by a factor of 2.5and laser efficiency was increased by a factor of 1.7.

To our knowledge, these results represent the best combinationof output power and beam quality achieved by either spectral orcoherent fiber beam combining to date.  Moreover, and in contrast tocoherently combined systems wherein the nearfield fill factor degradesthe farfield irradiance, the output beam is a nearly perfect, singlemode Gaussian in both the near and farfields.  Significant additionalpower scaling with similarly excellent system performance, either byincreasing the individual channel powers or adding additional channels,appears feasible.  For current demonstrations, the MOPA outputs areindividually collimated and then spectrally multiplexed with a multilayerdielectric diffraction grating.  Grating tests at peak irradiances  1.5kWcm2 show negligible wavefront distortion, as confirmed by theexcellent combined beam quality.  Future efforts will focus on increasingthe number of MOPAs and the individual MOPA output powers.

V. TerMikirtychev, J. B. Paul, J. J. Scherer, NovaWaveTechnologies, Inc.A broadly tunable, midinfrared fiber laserbased system has beendemonstrated at room temperature. The laser system consists of twohigh peak power pulsed fiber lasers along with difference frequencygeneration DFG in Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate PPLN.  Bothfiber lasers were operated with 100200 ns pulse duration and a 20 kHzPulse Repetition Rate. The first laser Pump was high peak powerTEM00 Yb doped fiber continuously tunable in the 1050  1080 nmregion with a bandwidth of 16 GHz, and produced up to 1 W ofaverage power 0.5 kW of peak power, 50   Jpulse.  The second laserSignal was a fixed wavelength, TEM00  mode, 1556 nm Er fiber laserwith linewidth of 50 MHz and produced up to 150 mW of averagepower.In a separate effort both lasers were combined into a single polarizationmaintained fiber using a fiber wavelengthmultiplexer, and then coupledinto a NovaWave Technologies commercial DFG conversion head toproduce a rugged allfibercoupled assembly.  By changing only thePump laser wavelength, continuously tunable radiation in the spectralrange  3300  3480 nm was generated with a maximum average powerof 9 mW 2.25 W of peak power when 1 micron fiber laser averagepower was 280 mW which was limited by a damage threshold of usedfiber optic components.  The demonstrated DFG conversion efficiencyof 0.2 WW2 20W is 100 times higher than that of CW operation.By simultaneously changing the crystal temperature along with thePump laser wavelength, the tuning range was increased to 3235  3545nm 310 nm.655225, Session 5High peak power Ybdoped diode pumped fiber amplifiersystemP. Madasamy, F. Kimpel, W. E. Torruellas, Fibertek, Inc.We have developed an Ybdoped fiber amplifier system at 1.064 mand achieved a peak power in excess of 1 MW with sub1ns pulses at arepetition rate of 10 Kpps.  Our approach involves a diode seed sourceamplified by a chain of fiber amplifiers with the fiber amplifier chainoptimized to minimize ASE and nonlinear effects.  We haveimplemented a hybrid modulation architecture for the first time wherethe direct modulation of seed diode laser and external electroopticmodulation are married together to generate clean 1 ns pulses withoutsacrificing efficiency.  The seed diode laser is direct modulated with 10ns pulses using a high current driver and passed through a first stagefiber amplifier operating in high gainlow signal regime. A 1ns pulse iscarved out of the 10 ns pulse using a LiNbO3 MachZehnderInterferometer waveguide modulator.  The pulse width and the repetitionrate of the amplifier system can eventually be varied over a wide rangefrom 0.1 ns to 1   s for the pulse width and 10 Kpps to 100Mpps forthe repetition rate.  The final stage high power amplifier produces anaverage output power of 12.6 W at 1.064 m for a pump power of27.5 W when operated at 1ns pulses with a pulse repetition rate of 10Kpps.  For a repetition rate of 20 Kpps and 1 ns pulses, the system alsoproduces 15.1 W average output power.655226, Session 5A novel side coupling technique for rugged allfiberlasers and amplifiersY.

Chen, B. Matheson, W. E. Torruellas, Fibertek, Inc. J. Faroni, N.Jacobson, K. Tankala, NufernCoherent Laser Radar is a versatile remote sensing tool, which can beapplied to rangefinding, target discrimination, vibrometric monitoring,air pollution monitoring, aircraft wakevortex and clearair turbulenceanalysis. A high power, highly efficient, near diffraction limited andhighly reliable coherent laser source is one of the key elements of sucha coherent monitoring system. With humans present, eye safe laseremission is required. Therefore a highly efficient fiber laser systembased on a coherent MasterOscillator followed by a chain of ErbiumEDFA and Erbium codoped with Ytterbium fiber amplifiers EYDFA isideally suited for this application suite.In this paper we are presenting advance architecture designs andexperimental results on high peak power EYDFA system with differentpulse widths at a wavelength of 1563nm.

Lupei, Institute of Atomic Physics Romania N. A. Pavel, Institutefor Molecular Science RomaniaThe enhancement of performances of the solidstate laser is essentiallydetermined by the optimization of the partial efficiencies thatcharacterize the flow of excitation inside the pumped laser material. Incase of Nd laser, pumped currently in the strongly absorbing energylevels placed above the emitting laser level, a modality to improve thelaser emission parameters and to reduce the generation of heat couldbe elimination of the parasitic upper quantum defect between the pumpand the emitting level by pumping directly into the latter. In many lasermaterials, this could introduce complications owing to the weaker pumpabsorption in this level and increased doping concentration could benecessary, leading to enhanced selfquenching of emission. The paperdiscusses the manifestation of these processes in several classes oflaser materials garnets, vanadates, hexaaluminates, borates and soon and in various wavelength ranges of the Nd lasers 900 nm, 1060nm, 1300 nm. It is shown that by a proper selection of the materials andof their characteristics such as the doping level, marked improvement ofthe laser parameters at the fundamental frequency or of theperformances of the nonlinear devices using this radiation could beobtained. Moreover, the reduction of heat generation by pumping intothe emitting level could be instrumental in scaling these lasers to higherpower levels.655231, Session 6Roomtemperature, nearIR fluorescence of high opticalquality KTPK. L. Schepler, Air Force Research Lab. S. M. Hegde, Univ. ofDayton R. D. Peterson, D. E. Zelmon, Air Force Research Lab.Fluorescence due to impurities or defects in nonlinear frequencyconversion crystals can be deleterious in secure communicationsapplications where spectral purity and photon entanglement areneeded. We have investigated roomtemperature fluorescence in the500900 nm spectral region from high optical quality, polished anduncoated KTP potassium titanyl phosphate crystals purchased fromthree commercial vendors and representing four different growthprocesses.  The crystals were all cut into 5mm x 5mm x 5mm cubeswith their dielectric principal axes along the cube edges. The pumpsource used was a tripled NdYAG laser operating at 355 nm with 7 mJof energy per pulse having a 3ns pulse width and 100Hz pulserepetition rate.  Samples from two vendors showed low fluorescence ofsimilar magnitude, while samples from the third vendor showed an orderof magnitude higher value in the peak fluorescence near 800 nm. Inaddition, all samples showed a weaker secondary fluorescence bandpeaking near 600 nm. Low fluorescence samples from one of thevendors also showed typical gray tracking at these pump radiationconditions.  Vendorproprietary growth processes clearly affect KTPoperating properties.  Efforts to investigate the origin of fluorescence inthese materials and reduce their fluorescence are planned.655253, Session 6Architectural issues and designs in creating high energyfiber lasersD. L. Sipes, Jr., Optical EnginesFiber lasers create unique opportunities for designing high energylasers.  The distributed gain and heat deposition, and the flexibleresonator provide the means for scaling to high powers.  In addition andperhaps more valuable is the idea that fiber lasers allow the creation ofan extensible architecture  an architecture where the individualcomponents can be researched, designed, improved and replacedindependently.  In order to create sources at power levels over 10kW involumes less than 1 cu. ft. weighing less than 50lbs at costs under 1per Watt of laser output.  Serious consideration first needs to be givento the underlying architecture of choice. In this presentation, severalarchitectural constraints along with competing approaches will bepresented.  Preliminary results from high brightness fiber couplingdesigns and simulations will also be discussed.655232, Session 7Walkoff correction using AFB similar nonlinear crystalcompositesH. Lee, H. E. Meissner, Onyx Optics Inc.Beam walkoff in uniaxial and biaxial crystals is a natural occurrencewhen the phase normal of the propagating electromagnetic wavedeviates from the direction of the Poynting vector.  Walkoff is a limitingfactor for increasing conversion efficiency and for restricting the OPOtuning ranges.The beam walkoff angle in nonlinear single crystals can be reversed bybonding similar nonlinear crystals rotated by 180 with respect to eachother.  An even number of twisted twins of single crystals is formed thathas negligible loss at the AFBr interfaces and is free of stress.  Sinceno adhesives are employed and the bonding force consists primarily ofVan der Waals attractive forces, there is no adverse contribution orabsorption at the bond interface.The theory of walkoff angles as function of orientation for uniaxial andbiaxial crystals is derived and discussed.  Correction of beam walkoffby producing an AFBr composite configuration results in more efficientfrequency conversion and thereby allows the generation of higherpower output of frequency converted radiation for a given input power.Beam correction is demonstrated experimentally for zinc germaniumphosphide ZGP as representative of a uniaxial nonlinear crystal, andon biaxial crystals KTP and LBO.  AFBr composites of ZGP withinactive ends of gallium phosphide have been produced in an effort topower scale a ZGP optical parametric oscillator for frequencyconversion into the midIR range.655233, Session 7Recent progress in transition metal doped IIVI midIRlasersS.

Theunique combination of technological lowcost ceramic material andspectroscopic characteristics ultrabroadband gain bandwidth, highsigma taw product, and high absorption coefficients make thesematerials ideal candidates for nontraditional regimes of operationsuch as microchip and multiline lasing.

We also present results on Fe2ZnSe laserhaving potential to operate at room temperature over the spectral rangeextended to 3.75.1um. Transition metal doped IIVI media also holdpotential for direct electrical excitation. The initial steps towardsachieving this goal by studying Cr2 ion excitation into the upper laserstate 5E via photoionization transitions as well as via direct electricalexcitation are also reported.655234, Session 7Raman scattering spectroscopy for explosivesidentification trend to UV excitationL. Nagli, Tel Aviv Univ. Israel M. Gaft, Laser Detect Systems, Ltd.IsraelReal time detection and identification of explosives at a standoffdistance is a major issue in efforts to develop defense against socalledImprovised Explosive Devices IED. Raman spectroscopy isConf. 6552 Laser Source Technology for Defense and Security III132 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssincreasingly important technology for homeland defense applications.The appeals of this technique are in its remote nondestructive and fastsensing ability. While Raman spectra are available for most explosives itis only recently that this method has emerged as promising tool fortrace level detection at standoff distance as well as method of luggagecontrol in airports.The main problem for Raman application is its weakness relatively toRayleigh scattering and luminescence of a substrate or sample itselfthat in many cases may blur desired signal. Raman signal canenhanced strongly using 1l4 dependence of Raman cross section andeven much higher enhancement at the vicinity of allowed electronictransition of the material. Deep UV excitation also strongly diminishesoverlapping of the luminescence, which is placed at violetblue spectralrange due to Stock shift range while Raman lines are very close toexcitation wavelengths.LDS at present is developing a commercial system for remote detectionof explosives traces using UV excitation. At the beginning of this RDwe find the lack of the absolute data of Raman scattering crosssections for many widely spread explosives.

Mirov, The Univ. of AlabamaBirminghamWe demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, an Erfiberlaserpumped, CW, highpower, singlelongitudinalmode Cr2ZnSe laser,potentially tunable over 23 m spectral range. The laser is operating ina single longitudinal mode regime with a linewidth of 80 MHz over a 120nm tuning range around 2.5 m, and delivers up to 150 mW of outputpower. The laser design is very compact and is based on KogelnikLittman cavity configuration with the total optical length of the foldedcavity of 10 cm. The narrowlinewidth output spectrum can be quicklyscanned over a 10 nm spectral range with a repetition rate of 200 Hz bya piezocontrolled tuning mirror which allows for an ultrafastwavelength tuning of the output spectrum over a large number ofabsorption spectral lines of trace gases of interest. As a testexperiment, we performed a Dopplerlimitedresolution intracavity laserabsorption spectroscopy of rovibrational transitions of the v3 and v1bands of H2O with minimum detectable absorption coefficient of3x107 cm1, which corresponds to 9 parts per billion by volumewater vapor detection limit. The laser is currently in active stage ofdevelopment and its further optimization will allow for full 23 m fasttuning range and Wattlevel output powers. This laser is being designedas a seeding source for an OPGOPAbased, highly sensitive tracegasphotoacoustic sensor system for realtime detection of gas traces ofbiological pathogens and explosives in the molecular fingerprint midIRspectral region of 210 m.655237, Session 8Fibercoupled diode laser systems for highpower andhighbrightness applicationsD. M. Grasso, S. D. Roh, N. P. Ostrom, B. O. Faircloth, Nuvonyx, Inc.Extensive research and development has advanced semiconductorlaser technology into a wide range of novel applications. Highpowerdiode lasers are the workhorse of many industrial and militarydefenseapplications, offering small size, high electrical to optical conversionefficiency, and high reliability. Despite these desirable traits, diode laserbars with a broadarea emitter geometry suffer from low brightness dueto their poor beam quality. Previous results have shown that singlemode diode laser bars can dramatically improve the beam quality andcoupling efficiency into an optical fiber. There is a desire to extend thisimprovement in laser performance at the bar level into next generationsystems offering enhanced spectral and highpower characteristics.In this work, we present the development of a suite of high brightness,fibercoupled diode laser systems at Nuvonyx. The use of flaredridge,singlemode waveguide emitters in these systems can lead to lowoutput divergence of less than 3 mrad and 10 mrad in the fast and slowemitter axes, respectively. The largest unit demonstrates highcontinuous wave power in excess of 1.7 kW at a single wavelength outof a 400 micron diameter core fiber with numerical aperture value of0.22. This represents a power density of  1.4 MWcm2, which is anorder of magnitude improvement over other commercially availablesingle wavelength, fibercoupled, diode laser systems.  Smaller systemswith wavelength stabilization and beam combination will also bediscussed.

Patterson, W. Dong, M. Grimshaw, P. Crump, nLight Corp.Peak CW optical power from single 1cm diode laser bars is advancingrapidly across all commercial wavelengths and the available range ofemission wavelengths also continues to increase. Both high efficiency 50 and  100W power InPbased CW bars have been available inbar format around 1500nm for some time, as required for eyesafeilluminators and for pumping ErYAG crystals. There is increasingdemand for sources at longer wavelengths. Specifically, 1900nmsources can be used to pump Holmium doped YAG crystals, to produce2100nm emission. Emission near 2100nm is attractive for freespacecommunications and rangefinding applications as the atmosphere haslittle absorption at this wavelength. Diode lasers that emit at 2100nmcould eliminate the need for the use of a solidstate laser system, atsignificant cost savings. 2100nm sources can also be used as pumpsources for Thulium doped solidstate crystals to reach even longerwavelengths. In addition, there are several promising medicalapplications in this band, including dental applications such as boneablation, apicoectomy, periodontal bony procedures, and medicalprocedures such as tissue ablation, skin welding and opthamology.Industrial applications include trace gas sensing and spectroscopy. Wehave extended our high performance 1500nm material to longerwavelengths through careful optimization of design and epitaxial growthconditions and report CW output powers from single 1cm diode laserbars of 37W at 1910nm and 25W at 2070nm.

Meng, Y. M. Hu, Z. Hu, S. Xiong, C. Cao, National Univ. ofDefense Technology ChinaNarrowlinewidth, linearlypolarized fibre ring lasers have attractedmuch research interests because of their potential applications inoptical sensors and optical communications. Several methods havebeen investigated to suppress mode hopping and obtain stable singlefrequency lasing. Previous work has demonstrated that a narrowbandreflection filter can be established in unpumped erbiumdoped fibreEDF, which acts as a saturable absorber in a ring cavity. Theimportance of using PM rather than SM unpumped EDF for enhancingstability has also been experimentally demonstrated. However, inpractical hostile environments, the fluctuation of stateofpolarization inother SM fibres and devices in the laser cavity also induces the lasingmode hopping. This paper presents an all polarizationmaintaining fibrering laser with fast tunability, which is required to operate in someoptical fibre sensor applications, such as phase generated carrier PGCtechnique.The structure of the laser is a travellingwave ring cavity, which includesan EDF amplifier, wavelengthdivision multiplexing WDM coupler, acirculator, a piezoelectric ring wrapped with PM fibre, a FBG, anunpumped EDF and a coupler. All of the polarizationmaintaining fibreand devices can suppress the polarization instability effects on themode hopping. With a 100mW pump power, the output power of thestable singlefrequency laser is up to 5mW at 1536nm.  The extinctionratio of the linearlypolarized output is 25dB, the SNR is larger than60dB, the RIN is below 118dBHz and the linewidth is less than1.0kHz. The fast tuning rates of the lasing optical frequency achieves50kHz with no noticeable power fluctuations, and the maximum tuningrange is about 10MHz. This fibre laser has been used in aninterferometric fibre sensor and the experimental results show theequivalent phase noise is approximately 107dBHz with 20m opticalpath difference between two arms.655250, Poster SessionFabrication of NdYAG transparent ceramicsY.

Besides evidenttechnological high production yield, better control, capability toproduce very large laser active components or economical low cost,better use of the raw material, low energy consumption, the transparentceramics show functional advantages such as large compositionalversatility, higher doping concentration, controlled profile of the doping,from uniform over all the body of ceramic to gradient or steep change,improved mechanical or heat conduction properties and so on. Thusthese materials could extend the performances of the existing solidstate lasers or enable tailoring of new laser systems. Nevertheless, thegranular structure of ceramics rises problems concerning the variety,nature and the relative concentrations of the cationic sites, thedistribution of the doping ions in these sites, the energy levels and thetransition probabilities and the manifestation of the interactionsbetween ions and energy transfer. The present paper discusses the useof highresolution spectroscopy in solving these problems in case ofgarnets and sesquioxide laser ceramics produced by solidstatesynthesis, with grains in the tens of micron range. Special accent is puton new laser materials that show prospect for improving the laserperformance or for new laser emission schemes. It is inferred that fromspectroscopic point of view these ceramics could substitute and extendthe capabilities of these lasers.655252, Poster SessionDevelopment of robust solder processes for reliable highpower bars enables 70W onoff output at 50C case frompassivated 8xxnm bars hard soldered to CTE matchedpassively cooled heatsinksJ.

M. Sabatier, G. M. Matalkah, G. Broussard, R. Lirette, C. McNeill,The Univ. of MississippiThe seismictoacoustic transfer function SA has been defined as thetotal normal particle velocity of the ground surface normalized by thesurface acoustic pressure as measured by either a geophone or laserDoppler vibrometer LDV and a microphone.  This is a complex quantitythat describes the magnitude and phase of the grounds surface velocityrelative to the phase of the total pressure at the surface due to anincident sound field.  The phases of the grounds surface particlevelocity for both offtarget and ontarget locations offer contrast to aidin the detection of mines.  In raw, unprocessed images of themagnitude and phase of the grounds surface particle velocity as afunction of frequency, the strongest contrast image for the magnitudeappears at a lower frequency than for the phase contrast image.Simple harmonic oscillator models of the soilmine system suggest thatone look for the zero crossing in the phase response for pixels over themine as detection criteria.  However, both particle velocities measuredin field tests and plane wave, elastic layered models of the groundsphase response show many phase zero crossings for offtarget orbackground locations, thus precluding zero crossings as a stand aloneindicator for the presence of a mine.  Also, models and fieldmeasurements show that the complex velocity response of the groundbecomes spatially more random as the frequency increases.  Forfrequencies above the mine resonance, both coupled oscillator andplane wave acoustic models show the phase of the soil particle velocitychanges slowly between the first resonance and first antiresonance ofthe soilmine system.  In this study, an acoustical landmine stimulantthat has a high Q relative to most landmines is used to study thephases on and off target.655302, Session 1Adaptive CFAR detection algorithm for acousticseismiclandmine detectionG. M. Matalkah, M. Matalgah, J. M. Sabatier, The Univ. ofMississippiConstant False Alarm Rate CFAR detection algorithms based on themaximum likelihood ratio test of Neyman and Pearson have beenextensively dealt with in the literature and found to be giving satisfyingresults in a broad variety of target detection technologies. In this work, aCFAR algorithm is derived for acousticseismic landmine detection andapplied to high frequencyresolution spectral images of magnitude andphase of grounds surface particle velocity. The algorithm is based onthe experimentally justified assumptions that the magnitude of thecomplexvalued velocity spectrum follows a Rayleigh distribution andthat the phase, independently from the magnitude, follows a uniformdistribution. Based on the assumptions of magnitude and phasedistributions, statistical parameters are estimated from the large numberof samples provided by high frequencyresolution images order of 1Hz. Estimated parameters of background and potential target regionsare used to set a maximum likelihood ratio test against a particularthreshold value. The algorithm is adapted to select the backgrounddependent threshold value such that the test maintains a constant falsealarm rate. Results of applying the algorithm to images of different typesof background are shown and expression for the probability of falsealarm is derived.655303, Session 1Direct mechanical landmine excitation with LDV surfacemeasurementsS. S. Bishop, U.S. Army Night Vision  Electronic SensorsDirectorate P. Tsopelas, J. A. Judge, J. F. Vignola, The Catholic Univ.of AmericaRemote acoustic or seismic forms of excitation for laser Dopplervibration mine detection are seen as low false alarm rate detectionstrategies.  A more recent approach now under investigation includes aclosein direct mechanical excitation through a prodder or probe.  Inthis research we report on simple laboratory measurements of the TS50, VS50, PMN and VS1.6 landmines undergoing direct mechanicalexcitation through various probing techniques while measuring themines pressure plate vibration through a laser Doppler vibrometer.Excitation mechanism consisted of a supported mechanical shaker atthe aft end of a steel rod or a piezoelectric at the contacting tip of therod.  We determine natural modes frequencies, damping coefficient,stiffness and mobility transfer function.  Additionally, we report on theground surface response when the excited landmine is buried flush andat various depths in dry and.655305, Session 1Basic experiments on seismoacoustic waves,interacting with subsurface cylindrical voids and groundsurface sensorsT. G. Muir, R. Mack, J. M. Sabatier, The Univ. of MississippiCylindrical voids near the earths surface may include manmadetunnels, drain pipes, and conduits.  Their location and monitoring is ofinterest in law enforcement, as well as in agricultural and civilengineering.  A wide variety of Seismoacoustic waves appear to offerseveral different means for detection and monitoring, both passive andactive.  A 12 inch. diameter, concrete pipe, buried in soil at a depth of 8feet, and used for roof drainage in an urban environment, was utilized toexperimentally examine this hypothesis.  Three scenarios weresequentially examined in the 100 to 500 Hz band, all with sensorsdeployed in patterns on the ground surface and in the drain pipe, formonitoring, as follows 1 the detection of sound emitted by anupwardly oriented  loudspeaker, inserted some 20 ft. into the pipe, 2 avertical shaker source made to contact the top crest of the pipe at thesame lateral location, and 3 a moveable, groundsurface shaker.  Ineach case, seismoacoustic waves were detected, in surface patters,with triaxial seismometers.  The loudspeaker and shaker in the pipeprimarily generated vertically polarized body waves, while the surfaceshaker also reflected transversely polarized shear waves, all incharacteristic patterns that will be discussed in the paper.  Refractionappeared to affect all of the propagating waves.  The orientation of thedrain pipe could be determined from the sensed wave pattern on thesurface, and its depth from pulseecho measurements from the surfaceshaker, provided a representative geoacoustic model for the overlyingsoil is available, or is measured.

Das, Defence Research and Development Canada CanadaIn a series of previous papers, analytical results dealing with the effectsof  soil electromagnetic properties on the performance of inductionmetal detectors were reported. In this paper experimental data areprovided to verify some previously reported results. The timedomain136 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssresponse of a magnetic soil halfspace and  a small metallic spheresituated in air as well as buried in the soil were measured using apurposedesigned system based on a modified Schiebel AN192 metaldetector. As in the previous work, the sphere is chosen as a simpleprototype for the small metal parts in lowmetal landmines. The soilused was Cambodian laterite with dispersive magnetic susceptibility,which serves as a good model for  soils that are known to adverselyaffect the performance of metal detectors. The metal object used was asphere of diameter 0.0254m made of 6061T6 aluminum. Experimentaldata is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. Data also showthat for the weakly magnetic soil used in the experiments, the totalresponse of the buried sphere is the sum of the response of the soil andthat of the sphere placed in air.  This finding should simplify theprediction or measurement of response of buried targets as one canseparately measurecompute the  response of an object in air and thatof the host media and simply add the two. This simplification may notbe possible  for soils that are more strongly magnetic.655307, Session 2Toward a model for predicting the magneticsusceptibility of bedrock regolithB. J. Harrison, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology R. L.Van Dam, Michigan State Univ. J. M. H. Hendrickx, New MexicoInstitute of Mining and TechnologyOne of the Department of Defenses DOD most pressing environmentalproblems is the efficient detection and identification of unexplodedordinance UXO without the need to exhume large numbers of nonUXO. In regions of highly magnetic soils, magnetic and electromagneticsensors often detect large anomalies that are of geologic origin addingsignificantly to remediation costs. Up to 30  of the magneticanomalies identified during remediation of the Kaho olawe firing rangewere of geologic origin. Most rock types contain iron and their magneticsusceptibility is determined predominantly by the amount and form ofiron oxides present. The susceptibility of the most magnetic iron oxidesmagnetite, maghemite is approximately a factor 5001,000 higher thanthat of the most common iron oxides goethite, hematite. Therefore, itcrucial to understand the spatial distribution of different iron oxides sothat predictive models for magnetic susceptibility can be developed.When rocks weather, the amount and form of the oxides changeproducing concomitant changes in the magnetic susceptibility.  Thetype of iron oxide found in the weathered rock or regolith is a function ofthe duration and intensity of weathering, as well as the original contentof iron in the parent material. The rate of weathering is controlled byrainfall and temperature thus knowing the climate zone, the amount ofiron in the lithology and the age of the surface will allow us to predictthe amount and forms of iron oxide in the regolith.We have compiled analyses of the types and amounts of iron oxidesfrom soils over a wide climate range, from semi arid grasslands, totemperate and  tropical forests. We find there is a predictable range ofiron oxide type and magnetic susceptibility according to the climatezone, the age of the soil and the amount of iron in the unweatheredregolith.655308, Session 2Estimating soils effective magnetic susceptible from EMIdataI. Shamatava, Dartmouth College B. E. Barrowes, U.S. ArmyEngineer Research and Development Ctr. F. Shubitidze, DartmouthCollege K. A. ONeill, U.S. Army Engineer Research andDevelopment Ctr. K. Sun, J. P. Fernndez, Dartmouth CollegeEMI responses from magnetically susceptible soils can cause significantproblems for magnetometers and electromagnetic induction sensors, interms of both decreased probability of detection and increasedprobability of false alarm.  However, in most existing approaches toburied metallic object discrimination, the object of interest is assumedto be embedded in a medium with the same electromagnetic propertiesas freespace.  Any influence of the background medium is assumed tohave been removed by preprocessing or filtering before the data aresubmitted to an inversion routine.  Most existing techniques forcalculating the soil and geological effects, which include the halfspaceearth model and equivalent dipole layer models, have almostexclusively neglected the surface roughness of the soil. In addition,these techniques are limited to the use of one dimensional or layeredEarth models. Such models are incapable of capturing theelectromagnetic induction effects associated with the soil surfaceroughness pervasive in field environments.  We characterize theresponse from a rough soil surface so that it can be predicted, or sothat it can at least be accounted for during data processing. Thecharacterizing of soils EMI response requires knowledge of itsmagnetic susceptibility. To date the soils magnetic susceptibility ismeasured using very small amounts as little as 15 mg of soil, which formany soils does not yield the effective magnetic susceptibility requiredto predict the effects of the soil on the state of the art EMI sensors suchas the GEM3 and the EM63.The main objectives of this paper are to develop a new algorithm formapping the soils effective magnetic susceptibility using handheld EMIsensors at varying elevations, in both the TD and the FD, and toperform MonteCarlo modeling of random rough soil surfaces in orderto establishing a statistical relationship between surface roughness andsignal characteristics. The numerical algorithm will be tested againstmeasured data for a variety of soil types. Finally, to aid in UXOdiscrimination under realistic field conditions, the algorithm will combinethese soil calculations with current the state of the art EMI modelingtechniques to separate and account for the soil response within UXOclassification algorithms.655309, Session 2Evaluation of the Geonics EM63 timedomain metaldetectordiscriminatorL. S. Riggs, Auburn Univ. B. E. Barrowes, K. A. ONeill, U.S. ArmyEngineer Research and Development Ctr.The EM63 Manufactured by Geonics Ltd. of Mississauga, Ontario,Canada is a timedomain electromagnetic induction metal detectordiscriminator. It consists of a 1m X 1m transmitter coil and three 21 inchX 21 inch coaxially stacked receiver coils.  The bottom receiver coil liesin the plane of the transmitter coil while the middletop coil is 1224inches above the plan of the transmitter coil.  The transmitter currentwaveform rises exponentially to around 15 Amperes and then falls tozero in a linear ramp in approximately 100 microseconds.  The circuitryused to generate the transmitter current as well as other interestingtransmitter current waveform characteristics shall be discussed.  Theinput impedance characteristics of the receiver coils have beenmeasured and a model of their electrical characteristics shall bepresented. Furthermore, the frequency response characteristics of thereceiver coil preamplifier have also been measured and will bepresented.  The EM63 has been used to measure a variety of testobjects including three copper loops with fast, medium, and slow timeconstants as well as two different ferrous cylinders and a ferroussphere. This data shall be presented in light of the sensors ability todiscriminate among unexploded ordnance UXO and between UXO andmetallic clutter. Concluding, the paper will compare the performance ofthe EM63 to metal detectorsdiscriminators sold by othermanufactures.655310, Session 2Broadband electromagnetic induction sensorW. R. Scott, Jr., G. D. Larson, Georgia Institute of TechnologyIn recent years, advanced electromagnetic induction EMI sensors havebeen shown to be capable of discrimination between buried landminesand various metal clutter. The detectors accomplish this by utilizing abroad range of frequencies or a broad range of measurement times inconjunction with advanced signal processing.  For these advanced EMIsensors to be effective, they must accurately, repeatably, and quicklymeasure the response of a buried target.  This is difficult because thesensor must operate with bandwidths greater than 100 to 1 whileaccurately measuring signals that are more than 80dB smaller than thedirect coupling between the coils on the EMI sensor.  In order toaccomplish this, the EMI sensor must be very cleverly designed toConf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 137account for the coupling between the transmit and receive coils and forthe secondary effects such as the resonances in the coils.In most EMI sensors, the coupling between the coils is handled by one oftwo methods.  In timedomain sensors pulsed induction, the couplingbetween the coils is mostly removed by time gating.  In frequencydomain sensors, the coupling is typically removed by using a quadrapolereceive coil which minimizes the mutual inductance between the coils.The quadrapole coils are formed in several ways, but they all have thedisadvantage of being less sensitive to deeply buried targets and havinga complicated detection zone when compared to a dipole receive coil.A prototype EMI sensor is developed that uses simple dipole transmitand receive coils along with a bucking transformer to cancel the couplingbetween the coils.  The results of laboratory and field experiments usingthis sensor are presented.  These results show that the sensor candistinguish between landmines and many types of clutter.655311, Session 3Inferring the location of buried UXO using a supportvector machineJ. P. Fernndez, Dartmouth College B. E. Barrowes, K. A. ONeill,U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Ctr. K. D. Paulsen, I.Shamatava, F. Shubitidze, K. Sun, Dartmouth CollegeThe identification of unexploded ordnance UXO using electromagneticinduction sensors involves two essentially independent steps Eachanomaly detected by the sensor has to be located fairly accurately, andits orientation determined, before one can go on and try to find sizeshapecomposition properties that identify the object uniquely.  Thedependence on the latter parameters is linear, and can be solved forefficiently using for example the Normalized Surface Magnetic Chargemodel.  The location and orientation, on the other hand, have a nonlineareffect on the measurable scattered field, making their determinationmuch more timeconsuming and thus hampering the ability to carry outdiscrimination in real time.  In particular, it is difficult to resolve for depthwhen one has measurements taken at only one instrument altitude.In view of the difficulties posed by direct inversion, we propose using aSupport Vector Machine SVM to infer the location and orientation ofburied UXO.  SVMs are a method of supervised machine learning theuser can train a computer program by feeding it features ofrepresentative examples, and the machine, in turn, can generalize thisinformation by finding underlying patterns and using them to classify orregress unseen instances.  In this work we train an SVM using measuredfield information, for both synthetic and experimental data, and evaluateits ability to predict the location of different buried objects to reasonableaccuracy.  We explore various combinations of input data and learningparameters in search of an optimal predictive configuration.655312, Session 3Buried metalic object identification by EMI sensorM.

Certain model features are alsointroduced to exploit the coupling effects between the conductingshape responses.  Discrimination of mines versus clutter based on theextracted model parameters is considered.  Furthermore, this work willcompare the effectiveness of discrimination based on the fourparameter model to a matched subspace landmine detection algorithmdiscussed previously Torrione et al., SPIE, 2002.  Different preprocessing approaches will be discussed and compared.  Experimentalresults using data from government run test sites will be presented.655314, Session 3A combined NSMC and Pole series expansion approachfor UXO discriminationF. Shubitidze, Dartmouth College B. E. Barrowes, K. A. ONeill, U.S.Army Engineer Research and Development Ctr I. Shamatava, J. P.Fernndez, K. Sun, Dartmouth CollegeThe detection and remediation of UXO on military ranges still continuesto be the number one military environmental problem.  The UXOdetection and discrimination activities conducted at DoD and DoE sitesusing current stateoftheart technologies often yield unsatisfactoryresults due mainly to the inability to discriminate between UXO andnonhazardous items.  Innovative discrimination and classificationtechniques that can reliably distinguish between hazardous UXO andnonhazardous metallic items are required. There are a wide range ofdifferent inverse scattering methodologies single and double dipolemodels, the standardized excitation approach SEA, the NSMC model,and etc currently being used or are in development for discriminatingUXO from nonUXO items.  In order to utilize these inverse approaches,first the buried objects location and orientation have to be inverted.Inverting for these parameters are the most time consuming and difficultphase of the inversion process, particularly when two or more objectsare simultaneously present in the sensors field of view, which usually isthe case in real field conditions. The secondary magnetic field that ismeasured by the receiver must have originssources, i.e. they areproduced by a certain type of source such as induced eddy currents ordipoles. These sources are distributed nonuniformly inside thescatterer. There are some particular points, named scattered fieldsingularities SFS, were most sources are located.The main objective of this paper is to combine the normalized surfacemagnetic charge NSMC method and a pole series expansion methodto determine the SFS points from the measured magnetic field, andthereby to find a buried objects location and orientation without solvinga time consuming inverse problem. The NSMC method has beendeveloped previously and is a robust model for predicting the EMIresponses of various objects. This method is applicable to anycombination of magnetic or electromagnetic induction data for anyarbitrary 3D object or set of objects.  In this paper,  the EMI responseswill first be collected at a planar measurement surface. Then the NSMCmodel, which distributes magnetic charge on a surface conformal to,but not coincident with the measurement surface, will be used toextend the actual measured EMI magnetic field above the datacollection surface to generate spatially distributed data. Then the poleseries expansion model will be employed and tested with the goal oflocalizing the scattered fields origins. Once the objects locations andorientations are determined, the EMI inverse scattering problemsimplifies to determining the amplitudes of the NSMC. Finally, the totalNSMC will be used for object classification. The proposed techniquewill be tested against real data with different signal to noise ratios.655315, Session 3NSMC for UXO discrimination in cases with overlappingsignaturesF. Shubitidze, Dartmouth College B. E. Barrowes, K. A. ONeill, U.S.Army Engineer Research and Development Ctr. I. Shamatava, K.Sun, J. P. Fernndez, Dartmouth CollegeDiscrimination of Unexploded Ordnance UXO from nonUXO itemscontinues to be a challenging problem. The high costs of excavating allgeophysical anomalies are well known and are one of the greatestimpediments to efficient cleanup of UXO contaminated lands at DoDConf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII138 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssand DoE sites.  Recent field activities from the UXO standardized testsite have shown that existing modeling and inversion technologies,which are based on a simple dipole model approximation, havedifficulty dealing with overlapping responses from closely spacedtargets. In order to provide effective and reliable discrimination in thesesituations, new methodologies for multiobject inversion are required.These new algorithms should implement more accurate and physicallycomplete EMI forward modeling algorithms.In this paper the normalized surface magnetic charge model NSMC ispresented for discriminating objects of interest, such as UXO, frominnocuous items, in cases when UXO electromagnetic induction EMIresponses are contaminated by signals from other objects ormagnetically susceptible ground. The NSMC model is designed forgenuine discrimination and is a physically complete, fast, and accurateforward model for EMI scattering. In physical reality, there are nomagnetic charges, i.e. no isolated magnetic monopoles. However, theycan serve as a useful and legitimate mathematical fiction. Because thefield produced by the magnetic charges constitute an analytic solutionto the governing EMI equation outside the scatterer, we can useficticious magnetic charges to generate real secondary magnetic fields.In the NSMC, the overall EMI inverse problem can be summarized asfollows first, for a given primary magnetic field the secondary magneticfield at selected points outside the object is recorded, and second, thescattered field information is used to distinguish an object of interestfrom innocuous items.  To connect the scattered field to its source, werequire a forward model, which the processing uses to infer sourceparameters.  Ideally these parameters are invariant even so that theyconstitute distinguishing characteristics of the object.  In the NSMCformulation that is presented here, the sourcefield connection isparameterized in such a way that fulfills this requirement, at the sametime being extremely efficient computationally. To illustrate theapplicability of the NSMC algorithm, we processed and analyzed blindtest data, which were collected at the Cold Regions Research andEngineering Laboratory facility from objects buried under different soiltypes, some of which were magnetically susceptible. In these cases,signals from nearby buried objects frequently overlapped.655316, Session 4An assessment of the fundamental performance of GPRagainst buried landminesD. J. Daniels, ERA Technology Ltd.

H. Nguyen, D. C. Wong, M. A. Ressler, F. Koenig, B. Stanton, G.M. Smith, J. P. Sichina, K. A. Kappra, Army Research Lab.The U.S. Army Research Laboratory ARL, as part of a mission andcustomer funded exploratory program, has developed a new lowfrequency, ultrawideband UWB synthetic aperture radar SAR forforward imaging to support the Armys vision of an autonomousnavigation system for robotic ground vehicles.  These unmannedvehicles equipped with an array of imaging sensors will be tasked tohelp detect manmade obstacles such as enemy minefields and boobytraps, as well as other natural obstacles such as ditches, quagmires,and bodies of water.  The ability of UWB radar technology to helpdetect concealed objects has been documented in the past and couldprovide an important obstacle avoidance capability for autonomousnavigation systems, which would improve the speed andmaneuverability of these vehicles and consequently increase thesurvivability of the U.S. forces on the battlefield.One of the goals of the radar is the ability to collect and process data atcombat pace in affordable, compact, and lightweight package.  Toachieve this, the radar is based on the synchronous impulsereconstruction SIRE technique where we employ relatively slowinexpensive analogtodigital AD converters to sample the widebandwidth of the radar signals.This paper will describe an experiment conducted this summer atAberdeen Proving Ground APG, Maryland.  The purpose of theexperiment is to support phenomenological studies of the backscatterfrom positive and negative obstacles for autonomous robotic vehiclenavigation, as well as the detection of concealed target of interest to theArmy.  In this paper we briefly describe the UWB SIR radar and the testsetup in the experiment.  We will also describe the signal processingand the forward image techniques used in the experiment.  Finally, wewill present imagery of positive obstacles such as barriers, concertinawires, mines, as well as negative obstacles such as ditches.655318, Session 4Fusion of disturbed soil feature for downlookinggroundpenetrating radar mine detectionE. M. Rosen, E. Ayers, Institute for Defense AnalysesFor vehiclemounted downlooking ground penetrating radar DLGPRsystems, the largest response is due to the radar reflecting off of theground.  Most DLGPR algorithms remove the ground bounce responseas a first preprocessing step.  The remaining subsurface response isthen used to detect buried mines.  It was observed that the groundbounce response over recently buried mines differs from thesurrounding undisturbed soil.  This suggests an approach in which theground bounce response could be used to enhance buried minedetection performance.  In this paper, we describe a technique forfusing the GPR ground bounce response with the GPR subsurfaceresponse to enhance mine detection performance.  The technique isapplied to data collected by a wide bandwidth impulse radar overburied mines in various soil conditions.655319, Session 4Improvements based on ground penetration radar fieldevaluations in AngolaF.

C. Tiwari, D. Singh, M. Arora, Indian Institute of TechnologyRoorkee IndiaDetection of buried landmines and estimation of depth by modelinglayered media is a complex and computationally intensive task. With theadvent of satellites which can provide data in various polarizations, ithas increasingly become relevant to investigate methods which can beused for the purpose of landmine detection using various polarizationtechniques. In this paper, ICA Independent component analysis hasbeen applied on image data obtained in two polarizations andinvestigated for detection of dummy landmines without explosives. Thedata for the purpose was generated through lab experiments in HH andVV polarizations in microwave X band region 10 GHz, 3 cm usingdummy landmines without explosives buried at different depths in drysand.  ICA attempts to produce statistically independent componentsfrom the mixed input signals. First, the data in each polarization wascalibrated, normalized and then convoluted using a 5x5 convolutionfilter. The convoluted data in two polarizations was then processedthrough FastICA algorithm and Otsus thresholding applied on theindependent components produced for landmine detections. Detectionswere attempted using Otsus thresholding without processing the datathrough FastICA algorithm also. It was found that the thresholding ofthe independent components produced most accurate results. Thebackscatter intensity calculated for the pixels detected as landmineusing ICA is being further processed for shape and depth analysis.655323, Session 5Multisensor, multienvironment learning for underwaterobject classificationJ. R. Stack, F. J. Crosby, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. Y. Hue, L.Carin, Duke Univ.The purpose of this research is to appropriately share informationbetween similar classification tasks during the learning process and toappropriately apply relevant, previously learned information to new,similar classification tasks.  Consider a set of similar underwatersensors operating over a variety of environments where someenvironments posses similarities.  It is expected that information gainedby one sensor in one environment is relevant to performingclassification given a similar sensor in another, similar environment.  Byjointly learning multiple classification tasks in a Bayesian framework, aConf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII140 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsscommon hierarchical prior is employed to enforce sharing of informationbetween tasks.  For each task, the prior distribution is drawn from aDirichlet process, which is nonparametric and automaticallydetermines the number and grouping of similar tasks.  Therefore, similartasks share a common, jointly learned prior distribution while disparatetasks possess different prior distributions.  When faced with learning anew, previously unseen task, this same framework facilitates theappropriate sharing of previously learned information to the new task.This produces improved performance over both learning the new taskgiven only the new data because the training data set is significantlyexpanded and learning the new task using all data equally because thenew classifier is not forced to generalize to all previous tasks.  Theproficiency of this technique is demonstrated on simulated data and ondata from multiple sidescan sonars operating from various unmannedunderwater vehicles in a variety of environments.655324, Session 5Underwater magnetic gradiometer for magnetic anomalydetection, localization, and trackingS.

T. Cobb, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. K. C. Slatton, Univ. ofFlorida G. J. Dobeck, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.Sidescan sonar images of the sea floor contain rich spatial informationthat varies widely depending on survey location, sea state, and sensorplatforminduced artifacts. Prior to applying an automatic targetrecognition scheme to find sea mines, the sonar image is usuallysegmented to better localize target regions and reject environmentaland platforminduced clutter. This paper presents a method for sonarimage segmentation using graphical models known as dynamic treesDTs. A DT is a mixture of simplyconnected Bayesian networks BNswhere the leaf nodes of each BN are assigned the value of thecorresponding image pixel. The DT segmentation task is to find the bestBN mixture that represents the underlying data. A Monte Carlo samplingmethod is used to determine the maximum a posteriori MAP DT quadtree formulation for each sonar image. Segmentation results fromseveral images are presented and discussed.655326, Session 5Underwater target classification using the wing BOSSand Bayesian samplingbased decision fusionN. S. Wachowski, M. R. AzimiSadjadi, Colorado State Univ.One of the most challenging tasks in underwater mine hunting is that ofdetecting and classifying minelike objects, especially when the objectsin question are buried or resting on the bottom.  This is due to the factthat reverberation, artifacts and secondary returns tend to makeanalysis of the acoustic backscattered returns difficult.  One way toeffectively deal with this problem is to utilize multiple looks of an objectto make a more informed classification decision.  Incorporating multipleaspects in the decisionmaking process effectively allows moreinformation to accumulate about an object, which in turn yields betterclassification results in varied environmental and operating conditions.One way of implementing a classification scheme involving multipleaspects is through the use of a Bayesian samplingbased system.  Inthis framework, a Gibbs sampler is used as a method for decisionlevelfusion by iteratively sampling the full conditional distributions of thedecision parameters until they converge to a distribution specified bythe joint posterior probabilities of the given parameters.  This methodwill be tested against previous multiple aspect fusion methods on arecently collected database that consists of sonar returns from variousburied or proud minelike and nonminelike objects in differentoperating and environmental conditions.  This data set was collected inJune 2006 by a wing Buried Object Scanning Sonar BOSS system.Features are extracted from the data using canonical correlationanalysis between multiple sonar pings  are then classified usingBayesian inference tools.  Results will be presented in terms of correctclassification rate for each object and general performance of thesystem in relation to the various operating and environmental conditionsencountered.655327, Session 6Automated sea mine detection, classification, and fusionin highresolution sonar imageryG. J. Dobeck, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.Since 1995, the Office of Naval Research has sustained a significantresearch effort in the area of automated seamine detection andclassification DC.  The thrust of this effort was fivefold 1 reducefalse alarms that slow mine clearance operations, 2 dramatically speedup post mission analysis so that the location of mines are reported tocommand and control in a timely fashion, 3 reduce the workload ofoperators who must look at volumes of sensor data, 4 increaseprobability of detection and classification against stealthy mines hiddenin the complex littoral environment, and 5 supply robust realtime DCalgorithms for the MCM autonomous underwater vehicle AUV systemsbeing developed to keep humans and assets out of harms way.

Aridgides, M. F. Fernndez, Lockheed Martin Corp.An improved sea mine computeraideddetectioncomputeraidedclassification CADCAC processing string has been developed.  Theoverall CADCAC processing string consists of preprocessing,subimage adaptive clutter filtering SACF, normalization, detection,feature extraction, optimal subset feature selection, featureorthogonalization, classification, and fusion processing blocks.  Therangedimension SACF is matched both to average highlight andshadow information, while also adaptively suppressing backgroundclutter in each subimage portion.  For each detected object, featuresare extracted and processed through an orthogonalizationtransformation, enabling an efficient application of the optimal logConf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 141likelihoodratiotest LLRT classification rule, in the orthogonal featurespace domain.The classified objects of 3 distinct processing strings are fused using theclassification confidence values as features and MoutofN, LLRTbased or Fisher Discriminantbased fusion rules.  The utility of the overallprocessing strings and their fusion was demonstrated with new highresolution HF and BB SAS imagery data, collected from a difficultshallow water environment.  The processing string detection andclassification parameters were tuned and the string classificationperformance was optimized, by appropriately selecting a subset of theoriginal feature set.  Three significant fusion algorithm improvementswere made.  First, a nonlinear 2nd order Volterra feature LLRT fusionalgorithm was developed.  Second, a BoxCox nonlinear feature FisherDiscriminant Ratio fusion algorithm was developed. The BoxCoxtransformation consists of raising the features to a tobe determinedpower.  Third, a repeated application of the subset feature selectionfeature orthogonalizationVolterra feature LLRT fusion block was utilized.Multiple ways of fusing the output of the processing strings wereinvestigated, including fusing the HF and BB outputs of each string andthen fusing the resultant outputs, fusing the HF outputs and BB outputsof the 3 strings and then fusing the combined outputs, or fusing the HFand BB of all 3 strings at one.  It was shown that cascaded Volterrafeature LLRT fusion of the CADCAC processing strings outperforms theMoutofN, baseline LLRT and BoxCox feature Fisherbasedalgorithms, yielding significant improvements over the best HF or BBsingle CADCAC processing string results, and providing the capability tocorrectly call the majority of mine targets while maintaining a low falsealarm rate.  Additionally, a separate investigation illustrated therobustness of cascaded Volterra feature fusion, since the algorithmyielded similar performance with a training and a test set, while in bothcases the fusion algorithm was trained on the training set only.This work was sponsored by the Office of Naval Research ONR 321OE,ONR 32MIW.

Zurawski, Raytheon Co.Raytheon has extensively processed highresolution sonar images withits CADCAC algorithms to provide realtime classification of minelikebottom objects in a wide range of shallowwater environments.  Thealgorithm performance is measured in terms of probability of correctclassification as a function of false alarm rate, and is impacted byvariables associated with both the physics of the problem and the signalprocessing design choices.  Some examples of prominent variablespertaining to the choices of signal processing parameters are imageresolution i.e., pixel dimensions, image normalization scheme, and pixelintensity quantization level i.e., number of bits used to represent theintensity of each image pixel.  Improvements in image resolutionassociated with the technology transition from sidescan to syntheticaperture sonars have prompted the use of image decimation algorithmsto reduce the number of pixels per image that are processed by theCADCAC algorithms, in order to meet realtime processor throughputrequirements.  Additional improvements in digital signal processinghardware have also increased the quantization level with which the imagedata can be converted from analog to digital format. This study examinesthe CADCAC algorithm performance for multiple types of decimationalgorithms and various quantization levels, using a wide range of atseadata from previous test exercises.655330, Session 6Coherentbased feature extraction for detection andclassification of underwater objects from sonar imageryM. R. AzimiSadjadi, J. D. Tucker, Colorado State Univ.Detection and classification of underwater objects in sonar imagery is acomplicated problem due to the various factors such as variations inoperating and environmental conditions, presence of spatially varyingclutter, variations in target shapes, compositions and orientation.Moreover, bottom features such as coral reefs, sand formations, and theattenuation of the sonar signal in the water column can totally obscure aminelike object.  In this paper a new coherentbased feature extractionmethod for highresolution sonar imagery is developed using canonicalcorrelation analysis.  Canonical coordinate decomposition allows us toquantify the changes between the returns from the bottom and anytarget activities in sonar images and at the same time extract usefulfeatures without the need to perform separate detection and anomalyfeature extraction.  These features can be used for simultaneousdetection and classification of minelike and nonminelike objects.Moreover, in situations where any visual analysis or verification byhuman operators is required, the detectedclassified objects can bereconstructed from the coherent features.  Test results of the proposedmethods on a dataset of underwater sidescan sonar images providedby the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Panama City, FL will bepresented. This database contains synthesized targets in real imagesvarying in degree of difficulty and bottom clutter. Results illustrating theeffectiveness of the canonical correlation analysis as a coherent changedetection tool will be presented in terms of probability of detection,false alarm and correct classification rates for various density of clutter.655331, Session 7Image processing of landminesD.

Kleissl, Univ. of CaliforniaSan Diego and New Mexico Institute ofMining and Technology J. M. H. Hendrickx, New Mexico Institute ofMining and Technology J. Simunek, Univ. of CaliforniaRiversideRemotely sensed temperatures of the earths surface are an importantdeterminant of the partition of the available solar energy into sensibleheat flux and evapotranspiration ET. In this manner, Landsat andMODIS thermal infrared bands provide crucial input for the SurfaceEnergy Balance Algorithm for Land SEBAL, which can be used togenerate spatial maps of ET and soil moisture. These maps facilitate theprediction of mine detection capabilities.To examine surface temperature evolution, a soil heat and watertransfer model HYDRUS1d is coupled to an atmospheric surface layerscheme. Idealized simulations are carried out for different soils, initialsoil moisture conditions, and atmospheric flow properties stability,surface shear stress. From the simulation results, the coupling betweensoil properties, surface temperature, and sensible heat flux is examined.655333, Session 7Assessments of phenomenologies for multioptical minedetectionS.

M. Winter, Technical Research Associates, Inc.Disturbed soil is an indicator of military operations and detection ofdisturbed soil can be an important tool for the detection of buriedmines.  In this paper we will concentrate on the phenomenology ofdisturbed soil as observed in the LWIR portion of the spectrum.  Theprincipal observable associated with disturbance of dirt surfaces is thatthe spectral contrast in the vicinity of 9.2 micrometers is reduced indisturbed areas relative to undisturbed surfaces.  The original theorydeveloped by the University of Hawaii is that the signature of thedisturbed soil is due to the reststrahlen signature of quartz, and thedifference between disturbed and undisturbed soil is caused by fineparticles clinging to the larger soil particles.  Laboratory measurementshave documented that the depth of the reststrahlen emissivity feature isdirectly related to the size of the silicate minerals in the soil, principallyquartz.  New observations made with the University of Hawaii AHI LWIRhyperspectral sensor by the U. S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Visionand Electronic Sensors Directorate, backed up by a reexamination ofdata taken previously, have created a new picture that extends theoriginal theory.  The relative depth of the two reststrahlen spectralfeatures at 8.25 and 9.2 micrometers is different in measurements ofdisturbed and undisturbed soil.  This effect correlates well with spectralmeasurements on quartz particles of different sizes.  This newobservation is important because if the spectral effect were simply anattenuation of the basic background signature, disturbed soil could notbe distinguished from linear mixtures of background and vegetation.These new findings show that we are detecting the fine particlesdirectly, which means that the disturbed soil has a unique spectrum andcan be separated from mixtures of blackbody vegetation andundisturbed soil.  To verify this behavior, we examined measurementspreviously made at a variety of locations and on a wide variety of soiltypes made with LWIR hand held spectrometer and airbornemeasurements.   The results of the analysis of these measurements andtheir impact on the design of detection algorithms will be presented.655335, Session 8Buried mine detection in airborne imagery using cooccurrence texture featuresS. Tiwari, S. Agarwal, Univ. of MissouriRolla A. H. Trang, U.S. ArmyNight Vision  Electronic Sensors DirectorateIn the recent past, airborne minefield detection has increasingly beenexplored, due to its capability for lowrisk standoff detection and quickturnaround time. Significant research efforts have focused on thedetection of surface mines and few techniques have been proposedspecifically for buried mine detection. Although reasonable performancehas been achieved for surface mine detection, detection performancefor buried mines is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose analgorithm for buried mine detection in multispectral and singlebandMWIR imagery based on the texture features using graylevel cooccurrence matrices GLCM. Based on the analysis of raw GLCMfeatures extracted from the imagery, composite features are tailored forimproved discrimination of buried mine signature. RX algorithm is usedfor anomaly detection on the different feature images obtained from theaforementioned discriminatory features. These anomaly detectorresponses are combined into modalities adapted for improveddetection and reduced false alarms. The proposed method iscompletely unsupervised, and being based on cooccurrence matrixfeatures, is largely invariant to illumination changes in the images. Wepresent detection performance results for the proposed method andcompare it with the existing methods for buried mine detection. We alsopresent results showing the improvement in the detection performanceachieved by the fusion of the texture featurebased detection andsimple RX anomaly detection over raw images. Results for both multispectral and singleband MWIR imagery are presented.655336, Session 8Multiclassifier buried mine detection using MWIR imagesB. Ling, Migma Systems, Inc. A. H. Trang, US Army RDECOMCERDEC NVESDThe fundamental challenges of buried mine detection arise from the factthat the mean spectral signatures of disturbed soil areas that indicatemine presence are nearly always very similar to the signatures of mixedbackground pixels that naturally occur in heterogeneous scenescomposed of various types of soil and vegetation. In our previouspublished work, we demonstrated that MWIR images can be used toeffectively detect the buried mines. Here, we further improve our existingmethod by fusing multiple buried mine classifiers. For each target chipextracted from the MWIR image, we scan it in three directions vertical,horizontal, and diagonal to construct three feature vectors. Since eachcluster center represents all pixels in its cluster, the feature vectoressentially captures the significant thermal variation of the same targetchip in three directions. In order to detect the buried mines using ourvariable length feature vectors, we have applied KolmogorovSmirnovKS test to discriminate buried mines from background clutters. Since webuilt one KSbased classifier for each directional scan, for the sametarget chip, there will be a total of three classifiers associated withvertical, horizontal, and diagonal scans. In our system, these threeclassifiers are applied to the same target chip, resulting in threeindependent detection results. Therefore, we further fuse them using ouroptimizationbased fusion method without imposing any assumptions oftheir underlying statistical distributions. Test results using actual MWIRimages have shown that our system can effectively detect the buriedmines in MWIR images with low false alarm rate.655337, Session 8Processed infrared images of plastic and metalliclandmines in an Argentine projectE.

Costanzo, Instituto de Investigaciones Cientficas yTcnicas de las FFAA Argentina M. E. Mejail, J. Gambini, J. C.Jacobo Berlls, J. M. Santos, P. Borensztejn, Univ. de Buenos AiresArgentinaA great development of technologies for the detection of buriedlandmines took place worldwide in the last years. In Argentina, a projectfor the development of an autonomous robot with sensors for landminesdetection was recently approved by the Science and Technology NationalAgency. Within this project we are studying the detection of landmines byinfrared radiation. Metallic and plastic objects with landmines shape anddimension were buried at different depths from 1 to 5 cm in soil with andwithout grass. Periodic natural warming by solar radiation or artificialwarming by means of electric resistances or flash lamps were applied.Infrared images were obtained in the 812 micrometers spectral bandwith a microbolometer camera. The IR images were processed bydifferent methods to obtain a good definition of the buried objects. Afterthis, a BSpline method was applied to detect the targets contours anddetermine shape and dimensions of them so as to distinguish landminesfrom other burid targets. We are looking for a landmine simple and fastdetection method , with detection capability of metallic and plasticlandmines and an acceptable false alarm rate which would be reducedwhen applied with other detection methods as GPR and electromagneticinduction. We present processed images and contours found by Bsplinemethod, and results obtained to distinguish buried landmines from otherburied objects.655338, Session 8Landmine detection using Bspline deformable contours inIR imagesM.

The true boundary is found whenthe values of these parameters vary abruptly on both sides.A likelihood function is maximized to determine the position of suchboundaries.We present the experimental results, which show the behavior of thedetection method, according to the buried object depth and theelapsed time from the cooling initial time.The obtained results  exhibit that it is possible to recognize the  shapeof the objects,  buried at different depths, with a low computationaleffort.655339, Session 8A novel patterned and unpatterned minefield detection incluttered environments using Markov marked pointprocessA. H. Trang, T. Broach, T. E. Smith, U.S. Army Night Vision Electronic Sensors Directorate S. Agarwal, Univ. of MissouriRollaP. Regalia, The Catholic Univ. of AmericaThe current minefield detection approach is based on a sequentialprocessing employing mine detection followed by minefield detection.The mine detection module is a combination of local anomaly detectorand false alarm rejection. The potential targets located by the anomalydetector include natural as well as manmade anomalies that contrastthemselves from the background. False alarm reduction works byselectingrejecting targets based on some prespecified criteria likeshape and color features of the target signature. However, targetsignature changes with time so they are different under differentenvironment conditions, are affected by background characteristics andchange with time of the day or seasons. Therefore, the currentapproach does not work robustly under different backgrounds andenvironment conditions. Moreover, the performance of the currentapproach degrades dramatically in the presence of high density of falsealarms. The aim of this research will be to advance the state of the art indetection of both patterned and unpatterned minefield in high clutterenvironments. The proposed method seeks to combine false alarmrejection module and the minefield detection module of the currentarchitecture by spatialspectral clustering and inference module using aMarkov Marked Point Process formulation. The approachsimultaneously exploits the feature characteristics of the targetsignature and spatial distribution of the targets in the interrogationregion. The method is based on the premise that most minefields canbe characterized by some type of distinctive spatial distribution ofsimilar looking mine targets. The minefield detection problem isformulated as a Markov Marked Point Process MMPP where the set ofpossible mine targets is divided into a possibly overlapping mixture oftargets. The likelihood of the minefield depends simultaneously onfeature characteristics of the target and their spatial distribution. Aframework using Belief Propagation is developed to solve theminefield inference problem based on MMPP. Preliminary investigationusing simulated data shows the efficacy of the approach. Limitedresults with available airborne minefield data are also presented.655386, Session 8Trial of a vehiclemounted UK electrooptic counterminesensor system as part of a UKUS collaborative programR.

ERCs distributionnear this surface and their relation to the location of explosive devicesare controlled by the fate and transport processes. A physicalexperimental work in a multidimensional soilatmospheric physicalsystem was developed to generate accurate data and information onspatial and temporal effect due to environmental factors on the fate,transport and detection of ERCs near soil surfaces. The systemincorporates a rainfall simulator, variable light visible and Ultra Violetspectrum, temperature and relative humidity components, and a 3DSoilBed capable of simulating several boundary and initial conditions.Experiments demonstrate that nonreactive solutes are highlyinfluenced by variation in hydraulic, advective, and dispersiveprocesses induced by changes in environmental conditions, howevergreat impacts for reactive and semivolatile solutes such as ERCs wereobserved. Fate and transport were affected by variations in sorptive,gas transport, and degradation processes. These Fate and Transportprocesses were integrated through numerical modeling, Hydrus 2Dcode, to develop the spatial and temporal concentration distributions ofthese chemicals under different environmental conditions.In the same way an air ERCs measurement system was developedusing xad2 resin. These air and water ERCs concentrations, solutesbehavior, and water and air pressure data obtained from physicalmodels, allowed the characterization and quantification of masstransfer, sorptive, diffusive, advective, and reactive transport processesof ERCs in soils.Conf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII144 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655383, Poster SessionVapor sampling of ERCs for environmental assessmentin atmospheric and soil settingsD. Acevedo, A. A. Anaya, O. Carrasquillo, I. Y. Padilla, Univ. dePuerto Rico MayagezThe existence of explosive related chemicals ERCs near the soilatmospheric and other surfaces depend on their fate and transportcharacteristics within the environmental settings. Consequently,detection of ERC in environmental matrices is influenced by conditionsthat affect their fate and transport. Experimental work to study the fateand transport behavior of ERCs relies on proper temporal and spatialsampling techniques. Because the low vapor pressure of thesechemicals and their susceptibility to adsorption and degradation, vaporconcentrations in environmental matrices are very low. Depending onthe environmental conditions, the amount of samples that can bewithdrawn for analysis is also limited. It is, therefore, necessary todevelop sampling technologies that can provide quantitative measuresof ERC concentrations in limited sampling environmentsThis paper presents experimental work conducted to develop asampling technique to quantify vapor concentrations of low vaporpressure ERCs in environmental setting having limited samplingvolumes. Vapor sampling volumes and efficiencies are quantified invariablysaturated soils, and near soilatmospheric and vegetativesurfaces.655384, Poster SessionAngular and intensity dependence of NQR remoteexplosive detectionG. Ota, H. Itozaki, Osaka Univ. JapanLandmine detection needs remote sensing, because explosives areburied under the ground, so that transmitting and receiving antennasshould be away from explosives. In order to design the arrangement ofthese antennas, angular and intensity dependence of NQR signal frompowder explosive were investigated. The NQR signal excited from asingle direction emitted mainly forward and backward along theexcitation direction and was weakly emitted to the directionperpendicular to the excitation direction. This result helps to designarrangement of a transmitting and receiving antenna. The adequateexcitation field intensity to excite a sample away from the antenna wasalso investigated. A remote detection requires much stronger field toexcite a sample away from the antenna to realize the same excitationcondition as the chemical analysis using the sample in an antenna coil.The excitation field intensity dependence of NQR signal was studiedand the existence of the minimum field intensity to excite the maximizedNQR signal was obtained. This result helps to design the transmitter forthe NQR landmine detector.655385, Poster SessionPhysical modeling of 2,4DNT gaseous diffusion throughunsaturated soilA. Torres, I. Y. Padilla, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezDetection of buried explosives devices BEDs through chemicalsensing is influenced by factors affecting the transport of chemicalcomponents associated with that device. Explosiverelated chemicals,such as 2,4dinitrotolune DNT, are somewhat volatile and their overalltransport is influenced by vaporphase diffusion.  Gaseous diffusiondepends on environmental and soil conditions. The significance of thismechanism is greater for unsaturated soil, and increases as watercontent decreases. Other mechanisms, such as sorption anddegradation, which affect the overall fate and transport may be moresignificant under diffusion transport due to the higher residence time ofERCs in the soil system.

Ivanco, S. B. Achal, ITRES Research Ltd. Canada J. E.McFee, Defence Research and Development Canada Canada C.D. Anger, ITRES Research Ltd. CanadaDRDC Suffield and Itres Research Ltd. have jointly investigated the useof visible and infrared hyperspectral imaging HSI for surface andburied land mine detection since 1989. These studies havedemonstrated reliable HSI detection of surfacelaid mines, based ontheir reflectance spectra from airborne and groundbased platforms. Allcommercial HSI instruments can collect and store image data at aircraftspeeds, but analyse the imagery offline after returning to base.Although useful for humanitarian demining, it is unacceptable formilitary countermine operations. We are developing a hardware systemwith algorithms that can process the raw hyperspectral data in realtimeto detect mines. The algorithms perform radiometric correction of theraw data, then apply the mine classification algorithms to the correcteddata, referencing a spectral signature library. The classification resultsare stored and displayed in realtime, that is, within a few frame times ofthe data acquisition. We demonstrated such realtime mine detectionfor the first time from a slow moving land vehicle in March 2000.  Thispaper will describe an improved system which can achieve realtimedetection of mines from an airborne platform, with its commensuratelyhigher data rates. The system is presently compatible with the Itresvisiblenear infrared hyperspectral casi and short wave hyperspectralsasi families of imagers. Experiments to detect mines from an airborneplatform in realtime were conducted at DRDC Suffield in October 2006.The results of these experiments will be described.655341, Session 9A thermal hyperspectral imager tasi for buried landminedetectionS. B. Achal, ITRES Research Ltd. Canada J. E. McFee, DefenceResearch and Development Canada Canada T. A. Ivanco, C. D.Anger, ITRES Research Ltd. CanadaDRDC Suffield and Itres Research have collaborated to investigate theuse of hyperspectral imaging HSI for surface and buried land minedetection since 1989. Visiblenear infrared casi and short wave infraredsasi families of imagers have been developed which havedemonstrated reliable HSI detection of surfacelaid mines, based ontheir reflectance spectra, from airborne and groundbased platforms.However, they have limited ability to detect buried mines. Thermalinfrared TIR HSI may have the capability to detect buried mines.Disturbance of quartzbearing soils has been shown to measurablychange their TIR emissivity spectra due to mixing of surfacesubsurfacesoil restrahlen band intensities vary with particle size. Some evidencesuggests that the effect can persist months after the visible disturbancehas disappeared. Carbonates and other materials exhibit similar TIRspectral features and heat flow anomalies caused by buried mines canalso be measured in the TIR band. There are no commercially availableTIR hyperspectral imagers available that are suitable for mine detection.The very few possibly suitable imagers are oneofakind researchinstruments, dedicated to internal programs and not available for thegeneral mine detection community. They also have a narrow field ofview and are very expensive. We have developed a TIR hyperspectralimager tasi based on a novel optical design and a cooled MCT focalplane array. The instrument has been designed with landmine detectionin mind. First light images were obtained in summer 2006 and theprototype instrument was completed in fall 2006. The design of theinstrument and a comparison with design alternatives in the context ofmine detection requirements will be discussed. Preliminary images willbe presented.Conf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 145655342, Session 9Development of a terrain surface model for opticalproperty computationJ. M. Cathcart, D. Cash, B. Remesch, Georgia Institute ofTechnologyIn this paper we discuss our efforts to develop a digital hyperspectralsignature model for terrain features. These efforts focused ondeveloping models for the optical and infrared properties of soils andvegetation features. A detailed geometric model of the particulate soilsurface is combined with radiative transport algorithms to computeemissive and reflective properties of terrain surfaces. These modelssupport analysis of environmental effects on terrain signatures,signature generation to support object detection algorithmdevelopment, and terrain clutter characterization. Environmental effectsmodeled and studied include soil particle size distributions, moisturelevel, and soil constituents. Particle size and moisture are shown toimpact these optical properties the impact on detection of subsurfaceobjects such as landmines will be discussed. A discussion of the terrainmodeling approach, the underlying analytical basis, and results from themodel computations will be presented.This work is supported under a grant from the Army Research Office.655343, Session 9Methods for determining best multispectral bands usinghyperspectral dataE. M. Winter, Technical Research Associates, Inc.Over the years several methods have been used to determining the bestbands for a visible near IR multispectral sensor.   The most popularmethod, the committee method, places scientists with differing opinionson the phenomena and the sensor mission in one room, and acompromise set is developed.   To avoid this, there have been severalmethods to automate this selection process.  We have developed amethod to examine hyperspectral data to find the best multispectralband set whether 3, 4, 5 or 6 bands based on the background, on thepremise that, with the target unknown, the band set that best separatesthe background materials is the best.  We start with a hyperspectraldata set of a background area without any targets.  We then run aprogram for determining the spectral endmembers.  Any endmembersthat look like they are due to sensor artifacts or an anomalous point onthe ground junk are discarded from the list.  The resultinghyperspectral endmembers are then input to an exhaustive searchprogram.  The goal of the exhaustive search is to find a set of  N say 4multispectral bands that maximizes the spectral angles between all ofthe endmembers.  Thus, at each trial the multispectral bands are madeby binning the hyperspectral to four bands in this case and thespectral angles calculated between endmembers 1 and 2, 1 and 3, 1and 4, 2 and 3, 2 and 4 etc. The endmembers in each case have beenbinned to four multispectral bands.  We save the average of thesespectral angle calculations.  After examining often millions ofcombinations, the multispectral band set that maximizes the spectralseparation is judged to be the best.  We have applied this method to theselection of multispectral bands sets for several sensors.655344, Session 9SPICE a sparsity promoting iterated constrainedendmember extraction algorithm with applications tolandmine detection from hyperspectral imageryA. Zare, P. D. Gader, Univ. of FloridaEndmembers of hyperspectral images are spectral signatures thatcharacterize distinct materials in a scene.  Endmember extraction isuseful for landmine detection in several ways endmembers canrepresent spectral signatures of mines or conditions indicative of mines,endmembers can represent spectral signatures of material that canconfused with mines such as bushes etc.  Endmembers can alsorepresent background conditions that may affect mine detection.   Avariety of algorithms exist for endmember identification.  Thesealgorithms suffer from the property that the number of endmembersneeds to be known in advance.  In this paper, an automated algorithmfor identifying the correct number of endmembers in an image isdescribed.Evey pixel in a hyperspectral image is assumed to be a weightedaverage of endmembers.  The weights in the weighted average arereferred to as the abundances.  The abundances are between zero andone and sum to one.   If all the abundances associated with a particularendmember are zero, then that endmember can be discarded.  Weproposed the method of sparsity promoting priors to force theabundances associated with redundant or meaningless endmembers tobe zero.  Specifically, an existing algorithm developed by Berman etal.referred to as the Iterated Constrained Endmember ICE algorithm hasbeen modified to incorporate sparsity promoting priors on theabundance terms.  It is shown that inclusion of the sparsity promotingterm can be incorporated into the Quadratic Programming approachproposed in ICE to find endmembers.  Experiments are described usingboth real and synthetic data sets that indicate that SPICE can effectivelyremove redundant and meaningless endmembers.  Applications tolandmine detection with real hyperspectral data are described.655345, Session 10Handheld standoff mine detection system HSTAMIDSoperational field evaluation in CambodiaR. C.

Ishikawa, Japan Science and Technology Agency Japan andTokyo Denki Univ. Japan K. Furuta, Tokyo Denki Univ. Japan N.Pavkovic, Ctr. for Testing Development and Training CroatiaThis paper presents an experimental design and evaluation results of atrial that were carried out from 1 February to 9 March 2006 using realPMA1A and PMA2 landmines at the Benkovac test site in Croatia. Theobjective of the CroatiaJapan joint trial is to evaluate dual sensorsystems, which use both a ground penetrating radar GPR and anelectromagnetic inductive EMI sensor. A comparative trial was alsocarried out by Croatian deminers using an existing EMI sensor, i.e., ametal detector MD. The trial aims at evaluating differences inperformance between dual sensors and MDs, especially in terms ofdiscrimination of landmines from metal fragments and extension ofdetectable range in the depth direction. Devices evaluated here are fourkinds of prototypes of antipersonnel landmine detection systemsdeveloped under a project of the Japan Science and TechnologyAgency JST, the supervising authority of which is the Ministry ofEducation, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology MEXT. Theprototypes provide operators with subsurface images and final decisionwhether a shadow in the image is a real landmine or not is left to theoperator. This is similar to the way that medical doctors find cancer byreading CT images. Since operators preknowledge of locations ofburied targets significantly influences the test results, three test laneswith different soils have been designed to be suitable for blind tests.The results showed that the dual sensor systems have a potential todiscriminate landmines from metal fragments and that probability ofdetection for small targets in mineralized soils can be improved by usingGPRs.655350, Session 11Automated calibration methods for robotic multisensorlandmine detectionJ. Keranen, J. Miller, G. Shultz, Applied Research Associates, Inc. Z.J. Topolosky, U.S. Army Night Vision  Electronic SensorsDirectorateBoth force protection and humanitarian demining missions requireefficient and reliable detection and discrimination of buried antitankand antipersonnel landmines. Widely varying surface and subsurfaceconditions, mine types, and placement, as well as environmentalregimes challenge the robustness of the automatic target recognitionprocess. In this paper, we will present applications of target recognitionsoftware modules created for the U.S. Army Nemesis detection platformfor variable environmental conditions and mine types. Nemesis is anunmanned rubbertracked vehiclebased system designed to eradicatea wide variety of antitank and antipersonnel landmines forhumanitarian demining missions.  The detection system integratesadvanced ground penetrating synthetic aperture radar GPSAR andelectromagnetic induction EMI arrays, highly accurate global and localpositioning, and onboard target detectionclassification software on thefront loader of a semiautonomous UGV. We present the results of newsystematic calibrations to adapt system parameters and targetrecognition software for site specific conditions such as soilelectromagnetic properties, surface conditions and variability,temperature, and target types.  Automated procedures were developedto account for frequency dependent dielectric permittivity, reflectivity,and penetration depth for the GPSAR.  Analysis of the variability in soilmoisture, surface roughness, and layering revealed the influence onGPSAR ground and array coupling, directivity functions, and effectiveantenna footprints.   We also considered the effects of mineralized soiland ferrous clutter for EMI data collected in a controlled test pit anddescribe enhanced timedomain processing from multiple coilconfigurations.  The results have implications not only for calibration ofsystem data acquisition parameters, but also for tuning of automatictarget recognition detection and discrimination algorithms.655351, Session 11Imaging of buried targets using seismic and groundpenetrating radar dataT. W. Counts, G. D. Larson, A. C. Gurbuz, J. H. McClellan, W. R.Scott, Jr., Georgia Institute of TechnologyIt is unlikely that any single sensor will be able to reliably detectsubsurface targets such as landmines and tunnels with a reasonablefalse alarm rate in all environmental conditions. The reason for this isthat the soil is a complex, lossy, and very inhomogeneous media. Manyof the inhomogeneities in the soil such as layering, moisture variations,rocks, roots, etc. can cause a sensor to give false alarms.  The loss inthe soil can also be very problematic for certain types of soil.  If there isprohibitive attenuation of the waves due to the loss in the soil, thesensors will perform very poorly.In this work both multistatic and multimodal systems are investigatedin an effort to improve the ability to reliably detect subsurface targets.The multiple look angles provided by a multistatic sensor mayenhance target features. The use of multiple sensors to sense a broadrange of physical properties will make the system applicable to abroader range of soil properties.An experimental system has been developed to collect colocatedseismic and ground penetrating radar GPR data for a variety ofsubsurface targets such as landmines and tunnels. Currently the GPR ismultistatic while the seismic system is bistatic. The data from theseexperiments is used to investigate the potential of inversion algorithmsthat use the multistatic andor the multimodal nature of the data.Methods for enhancing the signatures of the buried objects are alsoinvestigated.Conf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 147655352, Session 11Visual cues for landmine detectionJ. J. Staszewski, Carnegie Mellon Univ. A. Davison, Army ResearchLab.Landmines remain a major threat to US ground forces and their missioncapability. Although recently deployed handheld landmine detectionequipment ANPSS14 substantially improves countermine capability,the threat is not eliminated.  Military history suggests that visualperception of the terrestrial information produced by landmine burialrepresents an approach that can supplement landmine detection viahandheld technology and holds potential to increase detection ratesand reduce the hazard of the task.  Anecdotal evidence argues to thecontrary. Testing this controversial hypothesis first requires a detailedempirical description of the optically available information produced bylandmine emplacement and the manner in which such informationchanges with time and naturally varying weather conditions. Theobjective of the study is to systematically acquire needed objective,foundational knowledge on which training could be based. The keyquestions are 1 what visible cues resulting from mine burial can revealtheir locations and 2 how does this information change over time in thenatural environment This presentation will present initial findings froma study that buried demilitarized landmines whose sizes and shapescover the range of mines found in the operational environment. Trainedand experienced personnel emplaced the mines according to Armydoctrine in a secure test site at Fort Leonard Wood. Equipment for timelapse photography recorded highresolution images of the groundsurface where the mines were buried to document the effects ofnaturally varying weather upon the terrestrial cues and patterns thatmine burial produced. In additional to presentation of the images of thesoil surface signatures, qualitative descriptions of the visual features ofthe signatures that generated by an expert tracker and a pair of soilscientists will be summarized and presented.655353, Session 11NATOSCI133 guides for planning and reporting tests ofcountermine equipmentR.

Lockley, Defence Science and Technology Lab. United KingdomThis paper will review landmine neutralisation and marking systems andassesses how they can be downselected for incorporation into atechnology demonstrator system. The aim will be to illustrate detection,marking and route clearance capabilities against various antitankmines.A technology comparison matrix was constructed to allow the downselection of technologies according to defined criteria.  The matrixcaptures information from a toplevel review of a broad range ofneutralisation and marking techniques both currently in use and indevelopment.  The methodology developed for technology downselection allows filtering of technologies using the matrix and is flexibleenough to take into account differing operational scenarios andrequirements.  The results of an initial subsystem downselection usingthis methodology are shown.The requirements for the final technology down selection with respectto the overall system concepts are discussed. The application of thistechnique for down selecting technologiesmethods in a broadersystem context is highlighted.655355, Session 12Transport of explosive related chemicals from a pointsourceI. Y. Padilla, J. P. Gutierrez, M. d. L. Irizarry, A. Torres, S. Hwang,Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezThe transport of explosive related chemicals ERCs near their source isstrongly influenced by characteristics of the source. Although it is oftenassumed that sources of ERCs, such as landmines and other IEDs,release these chemicals at a constant rate, they vary temporallydepending on the environmental conditions.The effect of point sources on the fate and transport of 2,4,6Trinitrotoluene TNT and 2,4 Dinitrotoluene DNT in soil, water and airare studied in 1D and 2D columns subject to variable environmentalconditions. ERC concentrations and environmental conditions arequantified temporally and spatially to determine the behavior of thesource and the subsequent effect of fate and transport. A temporalfunction of the source is developed and applied to fate and transportmodels, which are used to further describe the behavior of thesechemicals in environmental setting. Preliminary results indicate thatdissolution and volatilization of TNT and DNT from a point source areratelimited and depend on the environmental matrix water, soil, airand condition. Differences are observed for different flow, soil, light, andtemperature conditions.655356, Session 12Adsorption coefficients for TNT on soil and clay mineralsN. Mina, R. Rivera, M. A. Muoz, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezTo understand the adsorption process of TNT on soil and clay mineralsis essential to determine the fate and transport mechanisms of buriedlandmines. In this research, soil samples from horizons Ap and A fromJobos Series at Isabela, Puerto Rico were studied. The mechanicalmethod was used to separate the clay fraction from the other soilcomponents. Using the hydrometer method the particle size distributionfor the soil horizons was obtained. Physical and chemicalcharacterization studies such as cation exchange capacity CEC,surface area, percent of organic matter and pH were performed for thesoil and clay samples. A complete mineralogical characterization of clayfractions using Xray diffraction analysis reveals the presence ofkaolinite, vermiculite, goethite, hematite, gibbsite and quartz. In order toobtain adsorption coefficients Kd values for the TNTsoil and TNTclayinteractions high performance liquid chromatography HPLC was used.The adsorption process for TNTsoil  was described by the Langmuirmodel. The higher adsorption was observed in Ap horizon. On the otherhand, the Freundlich algorithm described the adsorption process forTNTclay. The affinity and relative adsorption capacity of the clays forTNT were higher in the A horizon. These results suggest that adsorptionby soil organic matter predominates over adsorption on clay mineralswhen significant soil organic matter content is present. It was foundthat, properties like cation exchange capacity, surface area, type ofexchangeable cations and clay minerals present in the clay fractions areimportant factors in the adsorption of clayey soils.Conf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII148 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655357, Session 12Development of a multiscale packing methodology forevaluating fate and transport processes of explosiverelated chemicals in clayey soilsS. Rodriguez, I. Y. Padilla, S. Hwang, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezDetection of organic compounds TNT, DNT, and related substancesderived from landmines sources is influenced by fate and transportprocesses, which are affected by interrelated environmental, soil, andlandmine source factors.  It is, therefore, necessary to develop a physicalexperimental platform that will generate accurate data and information onthese processes. For this reason, a multiscale investigation has beendeveloped to systematically characterize and quantify the effects ofenvironmental factors on the fate and transport behavior of ERCS invariablesaturated soils.This work focuses on the development of methodologies that yield soilpacking characteristics for clayey soils similar to those found in the fieldand that can be reproduced across physical models of different scalesand dimensions. Prototype acrylic columns and tanks of different scalesand dimensions were used to test different packing methods.  Themethods used include gravitydriven sedimentation packing vibrationpacking induced settling infiltration and inverse infiltration. Thesemethods were evaluated under different water contents, including dried,field water contents, field capacity water content, and the water contentsat plastic and liquid limits. The systems were evaluated for consistentbulk density, porosity, and capacity of flow. Preliminary results exhibitsatisfactory values for bulk density ranging from 1.21.4 gcm3 for allmethods. Settling under plastic state has yield the best results so farsince capably reproduce the conditions found in the field.655359, Session 12Effect of environmental parameters on the chemicalsignature of TNT in soilM. IrrazbalAguilera, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezAs part of a large research program aiming to the development ofchemical sensor for detecting land mines, we have studied the fate andtransport of TNT subject to different ambient parameters. The space andtemporal concentration profiles of TNT, and its degradation compoundshave been measured using soil tanks. The following ambient parameterswere controlled to emulate environmental factors water content,temperature, relative humidity, and uvvis radiation. A series of soil tankswere kept under controlled conditions for longer than a year and sampledperiodically at the surface. After several months, all tanks were sampledvertically and disposed of. Chromatographic techniques GCECD withdirect injection were used for the analysis of the samples. Of particularinterest is the presence of several degradation compounds, as timeevolves, responding to the ambient parameters imposed. The verticalconcentration profiles of the several chemicals found, gives an interestingview of the degradation process as well as of the transport mechanisms.The results agreed with our computer simulations, and are being used tovalidate previous numerical analyses.655360, Session 13False alarm reduction during landmine detectionP.

QR works as a verifier or confirmation unit with thepotential to remarkably reduce false alarms. This is of particularimportance for demining, as currently hundreds of clutter items are foundbefore uncovering a single landmine.Significant technical and scientific advances have resulted in thefabrication of QR landmine detectors in compact, powerefficientconfigurations.

Osawa, Kansai Univ.JapanDescribed are research and development on an advanced antipersonnel landmine detection system by using a compact dischargetype fusion neutron source called IECF InertialElectrostaticConfinement fusion. The present detection system is effective to allplastic mines, in particular, by detecting neutroncaptured gammaraysof specific energies by nitrogen atoms to identify landmine explosives,as well as backscattered neutrons to identify hydrogen anomaly.Unlike beamtarget type fusion neutron sources, the IECF neutronsource is based on beamgas and beambeam colliding fusionreactions, thus, it has advantages of long lifetime because of much lessheat load on the target and less sputtering yield, as well as robustness,safe and easy operation, all of which are essential for the practicallandmine detection application.We have developed an extremely compact IECF device with a titaniumgetter pump as the main exhaust pump to endure the vibration when itis installed at automobile. The developed IECF neutron source employsdouble jacket chambers 20 and 30 cm in diameter, respectively forwater cooling, which enables CW operation with a high dischargepower of more than 6 kW, yielding neutrons of 107 sec. At the sametime, the 5 cm thick water coolant is found to be effective in reflecting2.45 MeV neutrons downward through a thinner water jacket installed atthe bottom. Also a BGONaITIcombined scintillation detector hasbeen developed for detection of neutroncaptured gammarays bynitrogen atoms in the explosives.

They are needed to design and optimize pulse sequence. Pulsesequences of SORC and SLSE have been adopted to detect NQRsignals from RDX and TNT, respectively. A Qswitch was also used toshorten blank time between the transmission excitation pulse and theNQR detection time.Environmental noise was removed by using a first order gradiometer,which functioned well in the field test. Two systems have beendeveloped for the field test of explosive detection. One is a handheldtype and another is a sensor head type which is attached to a robotarm. Both detectors were evaluated by detecting buried real explosivesunder the ground.Conf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 149655363, Session 13Portable LIBS and Raman spectroscopy standoffchemical analysis systemY.

Amethod for analysis of nitroaromatic explosives and its degradationsproducts was developed using SPME and high performance liquidchromatography with ultraviolet detection HPLCUV, introducing amodified interface that ensured accuracy, precision, repeatability, highefficiency, unique selectivity and high sensitive to detection andquantification of explosives from surface soil samples and increasedchromatographic efficiency. A pretreatment step was introduced for thesoil samples which extracted the target compounds into an aqueousphase. Several parameters that affect the microextraction wereevaluated such as fiber coating, absorption and desorption time andstirring rate. The effect of NaCl concentration on analyte extraction andthe role of various solvents on SPME fiber were also evaluated.Carbowaxtemplated resin CWTPR and polydimethylsiloxanedivinylbenzene PDMSDVB fibers were used to extract the analytesfrom the aqueous samples. Explosives were detected at parts permillion concentrations. This study demonstrates that SPMEHPLC is avery promising method of analysis of explosives from aqueous samplesand has been successfully applied to the determination of nitroaromaticcompounds, such as TNT.655366, Session 14Managing landmine detection sensors results fromapplication to AMDS dataM. P. Kolba, L. M. Collins, Duke Univ.Previous work by the authors using informationbased sensormanagement for static target detection has utilized a probability of errorperformance metric that assumes knowledge of the number of targetspresent in a grid of cells.  Using this probability of error performancemetric, target locations are estimated as the N cells with the largestposterior state probabilities of containing a target.  In a realisticapplication, however, the number of targets is not known a priori.  Thesequential probability ratio test SPRT developed by Wald is thereforeimplemented within the previously developed sensor managementframework to allow celllevel decisions of target or no target to bemade based on the observed sensor data.  Using these cellleveldecisions, more traditional performance metrics such as probability ofdetection and probability of false alarm may then be calculated for theentire region of interest.The resulting sensor management framework is implemented on a largeset of data from the U.S. Armys autonomous mine detection sensorsAMDS program that has been collected using both ground penetratingradar GPR and electromagnetic induction EMI sensors.  Theperformance of the sensor manager is compared to two different directsearch techniques, and the sensor manager is found to achieve thesame Pd performance at a lower cost than either of the direct searchtechniques.  Furthermore, uncertainty in the sensor performancecharacteristics is also modeled, and the use of uncertainty modelingallows a higher Pd to be obtained than is possible when uncertainty isnot modeled within the sensor management framework.655367, Session 14Landminedetection prescreeners based on featurelevelfusion of SAR and HSI dataK. I. Ranney, Army Research Lab.Many automatic target detection ATD algorithm suites include aprescreener as an initial link in their processing chains. It assists thedownstream algorithms by eliminating many potential false alarms whilestill retaining a large percentage of the objects of interest, therebyallowing for greater specialization by the downstream algorithms. Manysuch prescreeners have been implemented for individual sensorsforexample the constant false alarm rate detectors of radar systems or theRX ReedXiaoli detection algorithms of hyperspectral imaging HSIsystems.In this paper we examine straightforward methods for fusing theoutputs from synthetic aperture radar SAR and HSI prescreeners tocreate a multisensor prescreening algorithm. We begin by examiningthe sensor phenomenology for a specific operational scenario, and weincorporate this phenomenological information into both the individualsensor prescreener designs and the final fusion algorithm design. Wedescribe how the SAR and HSI prescreener detects are associated withone another prior to fusion. Finally, we discuss several fusionmethodologiesa polynomialbased detector, a DempsterShafer baseddetector, and a Bayesian detector based on an assumption ofindependence. The final results are compared with those obtained usinga single sensor.Conf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII150 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655368, Session 14Confidence level fusion of edge histogram descriptor,hidden Markov model, and spectral correlation featureD. K. C. Ho, Univ. of MissouriColumbia P. D. Gader, Univ. ofFlorida H. Frigui, Univ. of Louisville J. N. Wilson, Univ. of FloridaThis paper focuses on the confidence level fusion among severalpromising detectors for the vehiclemounted ground penetrating radarlandmine detection system.  The detectors considered includes EdgeHistogram Descriptor EHD, Hidden Markov Model HMM and SpectralCorrelation Feature SCF.  These detectors are feature based and theyoperate at the alarm locations declared from a prescreener that maypotentially contain landmine targets.  These detectors perform quitewell individually, and the purpose of fusion is to improve further thedetection results.EHD is a timedomain based algorithm that generates the edge featuresfor detection.  HMM is also a timedomain based algorithm that usesthe positive and negative edges from an alarm signature together withtimesequencing information of the edges to perform detection.  SCF isa frequency domain based technique that distinguishes landmine targetwith false alarm by examining the energy density spectrum estimated atthe alarm location.The fusion technique considered in this paper is based on theMahalanobis distance measure.  In particular, we collect the confidencevalues from the individual detectors at each alarm location to form avector, compute the mean vector and the covariance matrix of them forthe landmine targets and as well as for the false alarms.  Given a vectorof confidences from the individual detectors at an alarm, we computeits Mahalanobis distance from the mean vector of false alarms and thatfrom the mean vector of landmines.  The fused confidence is thedifference between them.  Experiments were conducted to evaluate theproposed fusion technique using the data measured from 4 differenttest sites with over 1500 landmine encounters.  Preliminary results showthat the proposed fusion technique reduces the false alarm rate by 16at 90 probability of detection, and by 22 at 95 probability ofdetection, when comparing to the result of the best individual detector.655369, Session 14Contextdependent fusion for landmine detection withgroundpenetrating radarH. Frigui, L. Zhang, Univ. of Louisville P. D. Gader, Univ. of FloridaD. K. C. Ho, Univ. of MissouriIn this paper, we present a novel method for fusing the results of severallandmine detectors. The detectors considered include Edge HistogramDescriptor EHD, Hidden Markov Model HMM, Spectral CorrelationFeature SCF, the Featurebased rules Order statistics and Adaptivewhitening FOWA, and Texture Feature Classification Method TFCM.The above detectors use different types of features and differentclassification methods.The proposed fusion method, called ContextDependent Fusion CDFis motivated by the fact that the relative performance of differentdetectors can vary significantly depending on the mine type,geographical site, soil and weather conditions, and burial depth. Thetraining part of CDF has two components context extraction andalgorithm fusion. In context extraction, the features used by the differentdetectors and other additional features that describe the backgroundcharacteristics are pooled. A novel clustering algorithm is then used topartition the training signatures into groups of similar signatures, orcontexts, and to identify the relevant features within each context. Thealgorithm fusion component assigns an aggregation weight to eachdetector in each context based on its relative performance within thecontext. To test a new signature using CDF, each detector would extractits set of features and assigns a confidence values. Then, the featuresare used to identify the best context, and the aggregation weights ofthis context are used to fuse the individual confidence values.Preliminary results on large and diverse Ground Penetrating Radar datacollections show that the context extraction part of CDF can identifymeaningful and coherent clusters. For instance, most contexts groupsignatures based mainly on geographical sites and mineclutter types.Our initial experiments have also indicated that the contextdependentfusion outperforms all individual detectors and other methods that use aglobal fusion.655370, Session 14Use of the Borda count for landmine discriminator fusionJ. N. Wilson, P. D. Gader, Univ. of FloridaThe Borda Count was proposed as a method of ranking candidates bycombining the rankings assigned by multiple voters. It has been studiedextensively in the context of its original use in political elections andsocial choicemaking. It has recently seen use in machine learning andin ranking web searches, but few of its formal properties have beenextensively investigated. In this paper, we describe both supervised andsemisupervised learning systems that employ the Borda Count as theirunderlying bases. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of thetechnique in the context of landmine discrimination. We discuss andevaluate methods for algorithm fusion using several weighted BordaCount methods and show how they affect algorithm fusionperformance.655388, Session 14Land mine detection applying holographic neuraltechnology HNeTJ.

Carin, Duke Univ.The signatures of landmines and clutter are typically a strong function ofenvironmental conditions. It is therefore important to select the trainingdata wisely, such that it is matched to the environment of interest. In thework presented here we employ nonparametric statistical techniques,based on the Dirichlet process, to cluster features extracted from GPRdata. The algorithm is applied to sequential features of interest to HMMbased classification, as well as nonsequential features. The formulationyields a framework in which the data are segmented without requiring apriori knowledge of the number of data clusters. After clustering, thetraining data are pruned, such that those clutterlike mine signaturesConf. 6553 Detection and Remediation Technologies for Mines andMinelike Targets XII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 151and minelike clutter signatures are removed from the training set.Typical results are presented based on data measured by the NIITEKsystem, with encouraging performance demonstrated.655372, Session 15Ground bounce tracking for landmine detection using asequential Monte Carlo methodL. Tang, P. A. Torrione, L. M. Collins, Duke Univ.Given their ability to detect landmines with low metal content, groundpenetrating radar GPR has received more and more attention. Tolocate the potential landmines accurately, the ground bounce GBsignature, which is a major source of interference in the 3D datacollected by the GPR system, is generally removed during the preprocessing process. A Sequential Monte Carlo method is proposed tomodel the locations of the GB signature, which is caused by thedielectric discontinuities between soil and air. The GB location at eachdowntrackcrosstrack position is treated as the hidden state in astochastic Bayesian system. As the data arrive scan by scan along thedowntrack direction, its posterior distribution is approximated by a setof samples with associated weights. Those samples are propagatedthrough the system evolution model in a predictive stage, whichincludes a deterministic component of the system dynamics and arandom component associated with process noise. The prediction isrefined with the new observation in a weight update stage by evaluatingthe likelihood of each sample. An initial training step sets parametersadaptively to accommodate different ground and weather conditions.The feature associated with the GB signature is updated with the arrivalof new data. The prior distribution for a given location is predicted bypropagating information from its two most recent neighbors, whichenforces a 2D continuity constraint on the estimated ground surface.The algorithm is verified utilizing real data and improved landminedetection accuracy is achieved compared with other ground trackingalgorithms.655374, Session 15Feature learning for a hidden Markov model approach tolandmine detectionX. Zhang, P. D. Gader, Univ. of Florida H. Frigui, Univ. of LouisvilleHidden Markov Models HMMs have been shown to be useful tools forlandmine detection and discrimination using Ground Penetrating RadarGPR.  HMMs are used to build stochastic models of thecharacteristics of the GPR signals acquired as the sensor passes over alandmine.  The stochastic models are built using sequences of featurevectors computed from the GPR signals.  The performance of HMMs,as well as other featurebased methods, depends not only on thedesign of the classifier but on the features.  Traditionally, algorithms forlearning the parameters of classifiers have been intensely investigatedwhile algorithms for learning parameters of the feature extractionprocess have been much less intensely investigated.  In this paper, wedescribe experiments for learning feature extraction parameters in thecontext of using hidden Markov models for landmine detection.The classification and feature learning parameters of HMMs are trainedusing a Minimum Classification Error approach that uses gradientdescent to minimize a logistic loss function of difference of mine andnonmine models.  Feature extraction algorithms are parametrized usingOrdered Weighted Averaging operators.  Features are initialized byclustering subwindows selected from landmine and nonlandminesignatures.  The magnitude of the Fourier transform is used to provideshift invariance.   Morphological thinning operations are performedgenerate minimal representations of feature elements.Results are shown for a large dataset of GPR measurements that wereacquired over a 4 year period at several geographic locations andseveral different environmental conditions.655375, Session 15Visual detection, recognition, and classification ofsurfaceburied UXO based on softcomputing decisionfusionA. H. Shirkhodaie, H. Rababaah, Tennessee State Univ.In this paper, we have addressed the problem of visual inspection,recognition, and discrimination of UXO based on computer visiontechniques and introduced three complimentary color, texture, andshape classifiers.   The proposed technique initially enhances an imagetaken from an UXO site and removes terrain background. Next, it appliesa blob detector to detect the salient objects of the environment.  TheUXO classification begins with a perceptive color classifier that classifiesthe found salient objects based on their color hues.  The color classifierattempts to differentiate and classify the color of salient objects basedon the color hue information of some known UXO objects in thedatabase.  A color ranking scheme is applied for ranking color huelikelihood of the salient objects in the environment.  Next, an intuitivetexture classifier is applied to characterize the surface texture of thesalient objects.  The texture signature is used to disjointedly discriminateobjects whose surface texture properties matching the priori known UXOtextures.  Lasting, an intuitive Object Shape Classifier is applied toindependently arbitrate the classification of the UXO.   Three softcomputing methods were developed for robust decision fusion of threeUXO feature classifiers.  These soft computing techniques include astatisticalbased genetic algorithm, a hamming neural network, and afuzzy logic algorithm. In this paper, we present details of the UXO featureclassifiers and discuss the performance of three decision fusion methodsfor fusion of results from the three UXO feature classifiers.  The maincontributing factor of this work is toward designing an ultimate fullyautomated telerobotic system for UXO classification anddecontamination.655387, Session 15Soil compensation techniques for the detection of buriedmetallic objects using electromagnetic sensorsL. R. Pasion, The Univ. of British Columbia Canada S. D. Billings,Sky Research D. W. Oldenburg, The Univ. of British ColumbiaCanadaMagnetic soils are a major source of false positives when searching forlandmines or unexploded ordnance UXO with electromagneticinduction sensors. In adverse areas up to 30 of identifiedelectromagnetic EM anomalies are attributed to geology. The mainsource of the electromagnetic response is the magnetic viscosity of theferrite minerals, such as magnetite and maghaemite. The EMphenomena that give rise to the response of magnetically viscous soiland metal are fundamentally different. The viscosity effects of magneticsoil can be accurately modelled by assuming a ferrite relaxation with aloguniform distribution of time constants. The EM response of a metallictarget is due to eddy currents induced in the target and is a function ofthe targets size, shape, conductivity and magnetic susceptibility. In thispresentation, we consider different soil compensation techniques fortime domain and frequency domain EM data. For both types of data weexploit the EM characteristics of viscous remnantly magnetized soil.These techniques will be demonstrated on time domain and frequencydomain data collect on Kahoolawe Island, Hawaii and the formerWaikaloa Maneuver Area on the Island of Hawaii. A frequency domaintechnique based on modeling a negative loglinear inphase andconstant quadrature component was found to be very effective atsuppressing falsealarms due to magnetic soils.655376, Session 16Image segmentation techniques for improved processingof landmine responses in groundpenetrating radar dataP. A. Torrione, L. M.

Most previous studieson landmine detection in GPR data have focused on the application ofstatistics and physics based prescreening algorithms, new featureextraction approaches, and improved feature classification techniques.In the typical framework, prescreening algorithms provide spatiallocation information of anomalous responses in downtrack  crosstrack coordinates, and feature extraction algorithms are then taskedwith generating lowdimensional informationbearing feature sets fromthese spatial locations.  However in timedomain GPR, a significantportion of the data collected at prescreener flagged locations may beunrelated to the true anomaly responses  e.g. ground bounceresponse, responses either temporally before or after theanomalous response, etc.  The ability to segment the informationbearing region of the GPR image from the background of the imagemay thus provide improved performance for featurebased processingof anomaly responses.  In this work we will explore the application ofMarkov random fields MRFs to the problem of anomalybackgroundsegmentation in GPR data.  Preliminary results suggest the potential forimproved feature extraction and overall performance via application ofimage segmentation approaches prior to feature extraction.655377, Session 16Landmine with groundpenetrating radar using discretehidden Markov models with symbol dependent featuresH. Frigui, O. Missaoui, Univ. of Louisville P. D. Gader, Univ. ofFloridaIn this paper, we propose an efficient Discrete Hidden Markov ModelsDHMM for landmine detection that rely on training data to learn therelevant features that characterize different signatures mines and nonmines, and can adapt to different environments and different radarcharacteristics. Our work is motivated by the fact that mines and clutterobjects have different characteristics depending on the mine type, soiland weather conditions, and burial depth. Thus, ideally different sets ofspecialized features may be needed to achieve high detection and lowfalse alarm rates.The proposed approach includes three main components featureextraction, clustering, and DHMM. First, since we do not assume thatthe relevant features for the different signatures are known a priori, weproceed by extracting several sets of features for each signature. Then,we apply a clustering and feature discrimination algorithm to thetraining data to quantize it into a set of symbols and learn featurerelevance weights for each symbol. These symbols and their weightsare then used in a DHMM framework to learn the parameters of themine and the background models. Preliminary results on large anddiverse ground penetrating radar data show that the proposed methodoutperforms the basic DHMM where all the features are treated equallyimportant.655378, Session 16Landmine discrimination using the KullbackLeiblerdistanceJ. N. Wilson, Univ. of FloridaIn this study, we look at application of the KullbackLeibler distance toclassification in landmine discrimination. We explore the relationshipbetween the information theoretic concepts of the KullbackLeiblerdivergence and mutual information with special attention to theasymmetry of the typical formulation of the KullbackLeibler distance.We consider two different approaches to using the KullbackLeiblerdistance as a classifier, one that applies to the density distribution oflandmine electromagnetic induction signatures, and another that treatsthose signatures themselves as probability density functions. Finally, weshow crossvalidation results of applying these techniques to a largecollection of actual landmine data.655379, Session 16Application of a modified FFT approach to thesubsurface imaging problemY.

But in the case of 3DHelmholtz equation such algorithm becomes less effective due to thenecessity of the solution of many 2D problems by direct method andthe effect of the replacement in the preconditioner the boundaryconditions of third kind with Dirichlet or Neumann type. In thispresentation, we consider a modified FFT based 3D preconditionerthat utilizes the same boundary conditions as the original discretizedoperator and requires the solution of the set of 1D problems. The resultsare compared to the application of GMRES and FFT combination. Theextended problem of solving Helmholtz equation for many frequenciesis also considered. Numerical results for realistic ranges of parametersin soil and minelike targets are presented.655380, Session 16Development of processing algorithm for HSTAMIDSstatus and field test resultsP.

It is shown that thebackground signals residual of a removing process of the dominantGPR signals due to airtoground interface have KDistributed statistics.The form and scale factors of KDistributions are estimated using thehigher order fractional moments. The clutter signals from three differentsoils have revealed different from factors. The form factor of KDistribution could generally differentiated three soils. In the second partof the study the receiver loss of CACFAR Cell AveragingConstantFalse Alarm Rate detector is calculated using a numerical method andthe MonteCarlo simulations.

L. Shoop, U.S. Military AcademyThere has been a significant amount of research focused on developingtrace detection techniques for high explosives for people and vehicles.There remains a similar urgent need for stand off detection of highexplosives in the complex environment in which the military operates. Awide variety of analytical chemical methods have been or are beingapplied to this problem.

S. Park, H. S. Hewage, D. P. Neikirk, E. V. Anslyn, The Univ. ofTexas at AustinResult will be reported from efforts to develop a selfcontainedmicromachined microfluidic detection system for the presence ofspecific target analytes under the US Office of Naval Research CounterIED Basic Research Program. Our efforts include improvingoptimizing adedicated micromachined sensor array with integrated photodetectorsand the synthesis of chemiluminescent receptors for nitramine residues.Our strategy for developing chemiluminescent synthetic receptors is touse quenched peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence the presence of thetarget analyte would then trigger chemiluminescence. In a slightlydifferent system we have recently verified this concept by measuringthe light signal, triggered by the presence of stimulant for Sarin andSoman, with a silicon photodiode. Preliminary results are encouragingas we were able to measure large photocurrents from the reaction. Wehave also fabricated and demonstrated the feasibility of integratingphotodiodes within an array of micromachined silicon pyramidalcavities. One particular advantage of such approach over aconventional planar photodiode would be its collection efficiencywithout the use of external optical components. Unlike the case of anormal photodetector coupled to a focused or collimated light source,the photodetector for such a purpose must couple to an emittingsource that is approximately hemispherical hence, using the fullsidewalls of the beads confining cavity as the detector allows the entirestructure to act as its own integrating sphere. At the present time, ourefforts are concentrating on improving the signaltonoise ratio byreducing the leakage current by optimizing the fabrication sequenceand the design.655403, Session 1Landmine detection using hyperspectral imagingJ.

CanadaThe FIRST, a commercial hyperspectral imager developed by Telops,features high sensitivity in a compact and robust package.  This sensorprovides hypercubes of spectral radiance of up to 320x256 pixels at0.35rad spatial resolution over the 812 m spectral range at userselectable spectral resolutions of up to 0.25cm1.  The measurementsare converted into chemical maps by the use of powerful algorithmsusing both spatial and spectral information.The FIRST has been used at several field tests for the standoffdetection and identification of chemicals.  During these tests, thesensor is usually operated at 4 cm1 of spectral resolution and theimage size is tailored according to the scene, which gives a temporalresolution of a few seconds, enough to produce videos of chemicaldissemination.Algorithms based on a combination of cluttermatched filters andspectral angle mapper have been developed and used to process themeasured data.  The algorithms combine subband selection tominimize the correlation between the spectral signatures in the libraryand careful selection of the thresholds to reduce the level of falsealarms.  The output of the algorithms is the image of the cloudssuperimposed on the broadband thermal image.JHUAPL has developed a processing approach that adapts to differentbackgrounds, yields high probability of detection of select gases ineither emission or absorption, yields low probability of false alarm, andperforms well in the presence of hot pixels.  The algorithm combinesbackgroundnoise suppression techniques, spectral detectiontechniques, such as the spectral angle mapper and the matched filter,and automatic adaptive threshold techniques.This paper will present the successful standoff detection andidentification of various chemical compounds using a variety of fieldmeasurements.

Chamberland, Telops, Inc. CanadaWith the constant menace of terrorist attacks with warfare agents, thecommunity needs reliable detection systems. The CATSI EDM system,designed for the Canadian Forces, offers unmatched performances forstandoff chemical detection and identification. This sensor is based onhigh resolution Fourier Transform Spectrometer technology and has aunique feature that performs automatic background rejection. Its widecoverage combined with its high sensitivity and large tendue makes ofit a very powerful tool for homeland security applications.This paper presents the conceptual approach for the optics, mechanics,thermal management and the main functionalities. Performance resultsobtained with the sensor during its integration are also presented.655409, Session 2Widearea hyperspectral chemical plume detection usingan asymmetric modelD. S. Rosario, Army Research Lab. J. M. Romano, U.S. ArmyArmament Research, Development and Engineering Ctr.This paper presents a novelty using an asymmetric model forhyperspectral HS image analysis and processing examples for severalapplications, including standoff chemical plume detection at a nadirlook.The application of this model has significant performance advantageover conventional models because, in essence, its application answersa different statistical question. Let a reference sample X and a testsample Y denote two random samples of unknown distributions.Conventional techniques are designed to answer whether Y and Xbelong to the same class Question 1, whereas our asymmetric modelanswers whether Y belongs to one of the classes in X Question 2. Weargue in this presentation that techniques developed to answerQuestion 2 are more effective suppressing the scene background,because remotely sensed natural scenes contain abundant transitionsof different regions, i.e., a sample X belonging to two or more classes isoften compared to a homogeneous sample Y belonging to one of theclasses in X.The state of the art techniques can not appropriately handle localtransitions of different regions, and as a result pixels near suchtransitions are often declared local anomalies. These unfortunatedeclarations have a negative impact obscuring the presence of genuinelocal anomalies elsewhere in the scene, e.g., an anomalous chemicalplume, personnel under CCD. Our asymmetric approach wasdesigned to answer Question 2, without assuming a priori theunderlying distributions of input samples, but under the null hypothesisit converges to a known distribution. Experimental results will be shownusing HS imagery.655410, Session 2Detection of simulants and degradation products ofchemical warfare agents by vibrational spectroscopyS. P. HernndezRivera, O.

Nieves, Univ.de Puerto Rico MayagezRecent terrorist attacks have motivated to focus the attention to thepossibility of use of chemical agents by terrorist organizations as threatsagainst troops andor civilians.  The anticipation of future attacksrequires a wide array of detection capabilities for range of potentialdeployment scenarios. Several techniques have been employed todetect and identify chemical agents including HPLCMS, GCMS, IMS,Infrared Spectroscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, among others.Conf. 6554 Chemical and Biological Sensing VIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 155Vibrational spectroscopy has the advantage that provides chemicalinformation it is nondestructive, requires little sample treatment andhas the potential for remote sensing. This work was focused in themeasurement of spectroscopic signatures of Chemical Warfare AgentSimulants CWAS and degradation products of chemical agents usingvibrational spectroscopy for the generation of spectroscopic libraries.The chemical studied were DMMP, DIMP, 2CEES, 2BAET, 1,4thioxane, thiodiglycol sulfoxide, dihexylamine, cyclohexylamine, amongothers.

M. Fuller, C. Schoellhorn, R. E. Hummel, P. H. Holloway, Univ. ofFloridaIt is shown that traces of 2, 4, 6Trinitrotoluene TNT display strong anddistinct structures in differential reflectograms, near 420 nm and 250nm.  These characteristic peaks are not observed from moth balls, nailpolish, starch, soap, paper, aspirin, polystyrene, polyester, or fertilizer, tomention a few substances which may be in or on a suitcase.  Thisexclusivity implies an ideal technique for explosives detection in masstransit and similar locations.  The described technique for detection ofTNT is fast, inexpensive, reliable, portable, and does not require contactwith the surveyed substance.  Moreover, a standoff instrument with thecapability to detect from a distance of one meter has been developed.Further optimization should allow larger detection distances.  Otherexplosives such as RDX, HMX, nitroglycerin, and PETN have also beeninvestigated and demonstrate similar, but unique, characteristic spectra.The technique utilizes UV light reflected from two spots on the samplesurface yielding a differential reflectogram of the sample correspondingto the absorption of the sample.655412, Session 3Infrared, nearinfrared, and visible spectroscopy of sarinM.

We have experimentally demonstrated the performanceof these systems in the nearIR to LWIR spectral region for threatobjects of interests. We developed and used TeO2, Tl3AsSe3, Hg2Cl2and Hg2Br2 crystalbased AOTFs for NearIR, Mid and LWIRwavelengths. Our objectives are to advance the performance level ofstateoftheart AOTF imagers and provide a path for teleoperatedsystems suitable for robots and other platforms for space and airborneapplications. In order to increase the efficiency and transparency rangefor LWIR AOTFbased imagers we are developing imagers based onnew high efficiency materials and unique designs.

The results on the growth of crystals,AOTF fabrication, and system design and performance are presented.The results of the optical system designs developed and tested forreducing AOTF aberrations, and producing pixel limited resolution arealso presented.655414, Session 3Investigations of quantum cascade laser sources for aMEMSscale photoacoustic sensorD. A. Heaps, P. M. Pellegrino, Army Research Lab.Photoacoustic spectroscopy is a useful monitoring technique that iswell suited for trace gas detection.  A sensitive differentialphotoacoustic method for trace gas measurements is proposed.  Thetechnique also possesses favorable detection characteristics when thesystem dimensions are scaled to a microsystem design.  The objectiveof present work is to incorporate two strengths of the Army ResearchLaboratory ARL, Interband Quantum Cascade Laser ICL sourcedevelopment and chemical and biological sensing into a monolithicmicroelectromechanical systems MEMS photoacoustic trace gassensor.  This work also investigates a novel tunable Quantum CascadeLaser QCL as a source that adds selectivity to the measurements.Previous data have show that reducing the size of the photoacousticcell can produce a very sensitive sensor using a CO2 laser.  Recentwork has shown that with a MEMS photoacoustic cell and using an ICLas the source a detection limit of subparts per millions for DimethylMethyl Phosphonate DMMP a precursor to a nerve agent is obtained.These studies involve the incorporation of an ICL source operating atabout 3.45 m.  These experiments have directing the creation of amodified MEMS photoacoustic sensor from the current design.655415, Session 3Standoff detection using coherent backscatteredspectroscopyA. W. Schill IV, P. M. Pellegrino, Army Research Lab. B. R. Arnold, L.A. Kelly, Univ. of MarylandBaltimore CountyIntense laser pulses may be used for standoff detection of energeticmaterials.  Coherent backscattered spectroscopy offers a tremendousadvantage over other spectroscopic detection techniques in that it usesstimulated emission from the sample to produce a coherent, directionalbeam back to the detection platform.  The characteristics of thebackscattered beam depend largely on the intensity and pulse width ofthe laser source as well as the concentration and photophysicalcharacteristics of the target molecule.  Different target molecules willexhibit different backscattered emission signals, allowing differentialdetection of energetic materials in the vapor phase.  Because to thehighly directional nature of the coherent backscattered beam, detectionlimits in the vapor of less than 1 ppm at ranges up to 100 meters can beanticipated.655416, Session 3The feasibility of a nanoinertial measurement unit usingchemistry to record positionM.

These twocomponents must be replicated in some fashion in a nano version ofthe same devices, specifically a nanoIMU is considered.  The proposedapproach combines an inertiallysensitive nanostructure or nano fluidstructure system with a micro or nano sized chemical reactor thatfunctions as an analog computer.  This paper will outline the feasibilityof using a cantilevercontrolled valve or an inertially responsive fluidflow to feed catalyst into a first order chemical reaction.  Theconcentration of the resulting product then provides a measure ofposition.  The proposed approach to the development of a nanoIMUwould allow the benefits of existing MEMS IMU technology to beapplied to an even broader array of applications by enabling thedevelopment of a new class of geospatiallysensitive drugs andmaterials and has application in a variety of military, intelligence, andcommercial activities, including targeteddrug delivery for cancertherapy or localized painblocking, and the tagging, tracking, andlocating of individuals of special interest.655417, Session 4Biological substance characterization in water matriceswith Raman microspectroscopyR. E. Jabbour, A. Tripathi, U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical BiologicalCtr. P. J. Treado, M. P. Nelson, ChemImage Corp. J. L. Jensen, A. P.Snyder, U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Ctr.UVVIS spectroscopy provides relatively little biological informationcompared to the rich spectral data and information content in theinfrared IR region. A parallel technology to IR detection is Ramanspectroscopy. Potable water sources are vital for the militarycommunity. Raman spectroscopy is applied to biological substances indistilled and tap water matrices. A confocal ChemImage Falcon IIRaman microscope was used. The incident laser radiation was 532 nm.Laser power between 50350 mW was evaluated to interrogate sporesand vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis and E. coli cells to preventburnout tendencies to the bacteria. The Raman technique wasinvestigated by plotting spectra of six organisms and five proteins inprincipal components PC dataspace. A PC plot of factors 134produced adequate separation between each biological substancecluster of points. Distilled and tap water matrices were investigated forspectral contamination properties to that of the biological sample. Adrop of sample was dried at time zero, and multiple slides wereproduced and monitored for 7 days to document the ageing effects.Replicate spectra of the 5 minutes, 5 hours, and 1, 2, and 7daysuspensions of colonies from the same agar plates were performed inboth water matrices. Each bacterium produced a separate cluster ofpoints where the ageing effects were essentially in a random fashionwithin each bacterial cluster. No systematic trend was observed foryoung to old cultures in a cluster of the same bacterial points or for tapand distilled water matrix preparations.655418, Session 4Detection and identification of a water mixture of E. colicells and B. subtilis spores with Raman chemicalimaging microscopyA. Tripathi, R. E. Jabbour, Science Applications International Corp.P. J. Treado, M. P. Nelson, ChemImage Corp. J. L. Jensen, A. P.Snyder, U.S. Army Edgewood Chemical Biological Ctr.Raman chemical imaging microscopy RCIM was utilized todiscriminate between biological substances with Raman spectraldatabase identification. Biological mixtures introduce a more difficultchallenge. A confocal ChemImage Falcon II Raman microscope and a532 nm laser were used for biological sample method. In the singleparticle mode, each detector pixel collected the scattered radiationfrom a 61 x 61 micron section in the field of view to minimize multipleparticle presence in a pixel. The 5001700 cm1 spectral region wasscanned. Water sample suspensions were investigated for determiningthe presence of multiple types of bacteria. Suspensions of E. coli cellsand Bacillus subtilis spores were mixed together in different ratios. Inthe bright field view, both bacteria were observed. Raman spectralimaging was used, and each pixel was an independent detector. Allpoints in principal components dataspace belonged to a bacterialspore, cell, debris, or the blank microscope slide. The Raman spectraprovided the detailed differentiation characteristics for the qualitativepseudocolor bacterial cell images. Different biological substances yielddifferent Raman spectral patterns of peaks. The Raman spectra of theselected colored features from the RCIM were compared to that in thedatabase for matching and identification purposes. Polystyrene beadsof known diameters were also added to the bacterial suspensions as areference. It is believed that this is the first instance that this methodhas been reported for the visual differentiation of bacterial species byRCIM.655419, Session 4Spectroscopic characterization of biological agentsusing normal Raman and surfaceenhanced RamanspectroscopiesS. P. HernndezRivera, T. LunaPineda, L. PachecoLondoo, E. DeLa CruzMontoya, K. SotoFeliciano, C. RosVelzquez, Univ. dePuerto Rico MayagezBioterrorism and its potential for mass destruction has been subject ofincreasing international concern. Only modest microbiologic skills areneeded to produce and effectively use biologic weapons. Productioncosts are low and aerosol dispersal equipment from commercialsources can be adapted for biologic weapon dissemination.  Itincreased interest in the application of several physicochemicalanalytical techniques for the rapid detection and identification ofmicroorganisms. Raman spectroscopy and Surface Enhanced RamanScattering SERS requires a minimum of sample allows fastidentification of microorganisms. The use of this technique forcharacterizing the spectroscopic signatures of these agents and theirstimulants has recently gained considerable attention due to the factthat these techniques can be easily adapted for standoff detection fromconsiderable distances. The techniques also show high sensitivity andselectivity and offer near real time detection duty cycles. This researchfocuses in laying the grounds for the spectroscopic differentiation ofStaphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus spp., Salmonellaspp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae,and  E. coli, together with identification of their subspecies.  In order toachieve the proponed objective, protocols to handle, cultivate andanalyze the strains have been developed. Spectroscopic similarities andmarked differences have been found for Spontaneous or Normal Ramanspectra and for SERS using silver nanoparticles have been found. Theuse of principal component analysis PCA, discriminate factor analysisDFA and a cluster analysis were used to evaluate the efficacy ofidentifying potential threat bacterial from their spectra collected onsingle bacteria. The DFA from the bacteria Raman spectra show a littlediscrimination between the diverse bacterial species however theresults obtained from the SERS demonstrate to be high discriminationtechnique. The spectroscopic study will be extended to examine thespores produced by selected strains since these are more prone to beused as Biological Warfare Agents due to their increased mobility andpossibility of airborne transport. Micro infrared spectroscopy as well asfiber coupled FTIR will also be used as possible sensors of targetcompounds.655420, Session 4Rapid, multiplexed, highsensitivity detection ofbiowarfare agents by surface plasmon resonanceenhanced common path interferometryC. Greef, V. Petrapavlovskikh, O. Nilsen, B. Hacioglu, AlphaSniffer,LLC J. Hall, Hall Stable Lasers, LLCReal time monitoring of biowarfare agents for military and civilianprotection remains a high priority for homeland security and battlefieldreadiness.  Available devices have sensitivity adequate for BWAdetection, but the detection modules have limited periods ofConf. 6554 Chemical and Biological Sensing VIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 157deployment, require frequent maintenance, employ  singleusedisposable components, and have limited multiplexing capability.Surface Plasmon ResonanceSPR Common Path Interferometry CPI isa labelfree, high sensitivity biomolecule interaction measurementtechnology that allows multiplexed realtime measurement of biowarfareagents, including small molecules, proteins, and microbes. Thetechnology permits continuous operation in a field deployable detectionmodule of an integrated BWA monitoring system.  SPRCPI measuresdifferences in phase shift of reflected S and P polarized light under TIRconditions at a surface, caused by changes in refractive index inducedby biomolecular interactions within the evanescent field at the TIRinterface.  The measurement is performed on a discrete 2dimensionalarea functionalized with biomolecule capture reagents in a microarrayformat, allowing simultaneous measurement of up to 100 separateanalytes. Since the optical beam spans the entire area of the transducerarray, optical scanning is not required, enabling a highly robust BWAmonitoring solution.  Output consists of simultaneous voltagemeasurements proportional to the phase differences resulting from therefractive index changes, is automatically processed and displayedgraphically or delivered to a decision making algorithm, enabling a fullyautomatic fielddeployable detection system capable of integration intoexisting modular BWA detection systems.  Proofofconceptexperiments on surrogate models of anticipated BWA threats havedemonstrated utility, and efforts are in progress for full development anddeployment of the device.655421, Session 4A study of spore identification from diffraction dataT. Le, M. A. Fiddy, The Univ. of North Carolina at Charlotte P. J.Gardner, General Dynamics Armament  Technical ProductsSome recent studies have focused on the spectral signature of sporesfor their identification e.g. Alupoaei et al, Biosensors and Bioelectronics19, 893903, 2004. While this is a promising approach, an alternative isto apply image recognition or classification techniques to the diffractionpattern of a spore.  Typical refractive indices of spores range from 1.38to 1.51 during activation from the spore to the vegetative state andsizes can double from  0.37 to 0.6 microns e.g. Katz et al, CLEOCThC3, p 1575, 2005.  This puts a spore or vegetative cell in the Miescattering regime and one can fit its precise size and shape to a simplescattering model of this type.  Scale and rotation invariant measures oftargeted features isolated from the diffracted intensity can be definedand once generated from real data, referenced to a lookup table forparticle identification. While there may be particles of no interest havinga similar size and index range in the air sample that flows through theoptical scattering system, when combined with wavelength diversity,additional features should permit a more precise identifier to be definedin principle.  A typical spore will contain a spore coat, exosporium,cortex and core wall each of which will have slightly different opticalproperties at different wavelengths, depending on their complexrefractive indices.  We will present an analysis and preliminaryexperimental results that examine the effectiveness of this approach ina practical system and discuss the optimal set of wavelengths required.655422, Session 4Noninvasive forwardscattering system for rapiddetection, characterization, and identification of bacterialcoloniesB. P. Rajwa, B. Bayraktar, P. P. Banada, K. Huff, E. Bae, A. K. Bhunia,E. D. Hirleman, J. P. Robinson, Purdue Univ.The latest specter of terrorism is driving the development of new,sophisticated detection systems for biowarfare agents. One of thegreatest challenges in the response to biological attacks is rapidrecognition of the agent involved. Only a few current technologiesavailable allow diagnostics to be performed in the field. The otherserious issue is the cost of biodetection technology. Most currentsystems are based on the use of PCR or antibodybased techniques.We believe that these approaches are overly complicated andexpensive. Additionally, traditional methods for pathogen identificationrequire complicated sample preparation for reliable results. Herein, wereport development of a noninvasive optical forwardscattering systemfor automated and rapid identification of bacterial colonies grown onsolid surfaces. The presented system includes application of computervision and patternrecognition techniques to classify scatter patternformed by bacterial colonies irradiated with laser light. A laserscatterometer equipped with a highresolution CCD chip andapplication of Zernike moments, Tchebichef moments, and Haralicktexture descriptors for pattern characterization allows for a very highrecognition rate. Fishers criterion has been used for feature selection todecrease the training time of machinelearning systems. An algorithmbased on supportvector machines was used for classification ofpatterns. Low error rates determined by crossvalidation, reproducibilityof the measurements, and robustness of the system prove that theproposed technology can be implemented in automated devices fordetection and classification of pathogenic bacteria.655423, Session 4Compact chamber for the spectroscopic analysis offluorescent aerosolsB.

The chamber, measuring 110 cm in length, was designedaccording to shortrange lidar principles, and will be used to simulateopenair releases of aerosols. Measurements, carried out by lightinduced fluorescence LIF techniques, will be correlated withspectroscopic data obtained with a longrange lidar system owned byDefence Research and Development Canada DRDC. The chamberallows complete control over environmental factors, such as humidity,pressure and temperature, thus facilitating the creation of trustworthyreference bases for the remote sensing of bioaerosols. Studies will alsoinclude the influence of growth stage, stress and growth media on theemission spectra of various biological aerosols.655424, Session 4Developments in onthefly biomarking a new method torapidly identify chemical and biological aerosolsM. B. Hart, H. Lin, J. Deich, C. D. Merritt, J. D. Eversole, NavalResearch Lab.We report on the advances made in the basic research to label specificchemical or biological aerosols onthefly using an electrospraytechnique.  Fluorescent biomarkers that have been created for specifictargets, and that produce a detectable change in emissioncharacteristics only upon binding, will be used to coat all aerosols in anair stream.  Aerosols with appropriate receptors will be labeled in thismanner, allowing them to be identified in near realtime using a simplelaserinduced fluorescence technique.  In effect, an immunoassay isquickly performed on the surface of single chemical or biologicalparticles as they flow in an air stream, labeling specific ones for rapid,singleparticle interrogation and identification among a diverse anddynamic background.  This method permits the use of solutionscontaining mixtures of different biomarkers to simultaneously identifymultiple types of chemical or biological aerosols.  Some issues that arecurrently being investigated include the kinetics of biomarker surfacebinding to an aerosol in flight and the control of charged aerosols forefficient single particle interrogation.655425, Session 4Extinction and backscatter cross sections of biologicalmaterialsM. E. Thomas, M. B. Airola, C. C. Carter, N. T. Boggs, JohnsHopkins Applied Physics Lab.Aerosol backscatter and extinction crosssections are required to modeland evaluate the performance of both active and passive detectionsystems.  A method has been developed by which begins withConf. 6554 Chemical and Biological Sensing VIII158 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsslaboratory measurements of thin films and suspensions of biologicalmaterial to obtain the complex index refraction of the film from the UVto the LWIR. Using that result with particle size distribution and shapeinformation as inputs to Tmatrix calculations yields the extinctioncrosssection and backscatter cross section as a function ofwavelength. These are important inputs to the lidar equation.In a continuing effort to provide validated optical crosssections,measurements have been made on a number of high purity biologicalspecies in the laboratory as well as measurements of material releasedat recent field tests.  The resulting observed differences aid indistinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic effects, which can affectthe characteristic signatures of important biological aerosols. A varietyof biological aerosols are examined.655426, Session 4Field testing results and ambient aerosol measurementsusing a dualwavelength fluorescence excitation andelastic scatterbased biosensorV. Sivaprakasam, A. L. Huston, H. Lin, J. D. Eversole, P. Falkenstein,A. Schultz, Naval Research Lab.A bioaerosol sensor based on dual wavelength fluorescence excitationand multiple wavelength elastic scattering  has been developed andcharacterized for classifying micronsized bioaerosols on the fly. Wehave been able to successfully classify different types of bioaerosolsincluding proteins and bacteria vegetative cells and spores anddistinguish them from several common interferents.  We have studied avariety of  simulants and interferents grown under varying conditions tocharacterize the performance of the instrument.  Simulant andinterferent aerosols were generated using several different techniques.The UVLIF instrument was tested during a twoweeklong, blind fieldtrial at the Edgewood, MD breeze tunnel. The instrument operatedunattended while simulants and interferents were released at variousrandom times during the test period.  The results of the field trial will behighlighted in this presentation.  We detected and correctly identifiedover 90  of the simulant releases and had zero false alarms over the 2week testing period.  In order to gain a better understanding of thecharacteristics of aerosols in the ambient air, we conducted backgroundmeasurements for extended periods of time.  These measurementsproved valuable in steering the algorithm development efforts.  Somepreliminary results from our bioaerosol classification algorithm will bepresented.655427, Session 4Early detection of chembio attacks using biosensorsand hyperspectral image processingA. K. Shaw, Wright State Univ. J. I. Medford, M. Antunes, ColoradoState Univ. W. S. McCormick, Wright State Univ. D. Wicker, AirForce Research Lab.Preparedness against possible Chemical and Biological chembioattacks necessitates developing precise earlywarning systems that candetect presence of harmful chembio material in an environment. Thedetection capability must be automated with widespread applicabilityand usage. In a recent paper, the researchers at Dr. Medfords lab havedeveloped a new class of biosensors Plant Sentinels that can serve asinexpensive and widely used detectors for explosives, chemical attacks,and environmental pollutants 2. Specifically, they have developedsynthetic degreening gene circuits that can induce rapid chlorophyllloss, thereby change color under the influence of synthetic estrogens.The synthetic degreening process mimics or simulates the effect ofpossible chembio attack. Currently, the degreening phenomenon viabiosensors is remotely detectable by human eyes. However, in order tomake the plant sentinel system practically viable, some form ofautomated monitoring for early detection scheme is needed. This paperdevelops novel and effective HSIbased algorithms for early detectionof degreening of plants and vegetation biosensors or plantsentinels due to biological or chemical agents. The image processingbased automated degreening detector, proposed in this paper will becapable of 247 monitoring of the plant sentinels and to detect minutestpossible discoloration of the plantsensors to serve as a earlywarningsystem.

Of particular interest is the identification of biologicalaerosols. Spectrally resolved fluorescence cross sections are measuredon suspensions of BG and BT in water. The Raman line of water is usedto calibrate the fluorescence cross section. The results are in goodagreement with published band averaged cross section values on BG.655429, Session 5Field portable labelfree, reagentfree pathogendetection systemN. V. Menon, G. Zeltser, P.

The DIRASBI system will include a selfcleaningsystem with automatic sample decontamination and a userfriendly GUIenabling nonexpert usage. We will discuss the recent developmentsthat are aimed to revolutionize pathogen detection for military,homeland and medical applications.655430, Session 5Detection and classification of atmospheric aerosolsusing multiwavelength CO2 lidarR. E. Warren, EOStat, Inc. R. G. Vanderbeek, U.S. Army EdgewoodChemical Biological Ctr.This paper describes the theory and processing algorithms developedto date for parameter estimation, detection and classification oflocalized aerosols in the atmosphere using information provided bymultiplewavelength rangeresolved lidar.  The motivation for this workis the need to detect, locate, and identify potentially toxic atmosphericaerosols at safe standoff ranges using timeseries data collected at adiscrete set of CO2 laser wavelengths.  The goals of the processing areto use the digitized transmitted and received backscatter array data to1 decide if significant aerosol is present, 2 provide estimates of therange and size of the aerosol cloud, 3 produce estimates of thebackscatter spectral dependence, and 4 classify the aerosol as a bioagent or nonthreat material.  Because of the timeseries nature of thedata collection, these four functions must be performed sequentiallyusing the current and past data together with background data samplescollected at the deployment site from calibration data not containingreleaseaerosols.  These calibration data samples are essential forproviding the input to normalize the potentially releasecontaining data.The estimation and detection methodology is as follows.  FollowingConf. 6554 Chemical and Biological Sensing VIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 159preprocessing of the data to remove outlier data, a filter based on theWienerHelstrom method is used to deconvolve the CO2 pulsewaveform for each pulse.  The pulsedeconvolved data is passed on toa sequential filter for estimating the spectral backscatter and rangeresolved concentration in parallel.  The backscatter is estimated throughmaximum likelihood given the current estimate of concentration.Likewise, the concentration estimates are updated through a Kalmanfilter that uses the current backscatter estimates.  A possibly novelfeature of the concentration filter is the use of an expansion of theconcentration rangedependence in an orthonormal set of basisfunctions.  The use of an orthogonal expansion provides acomputationally efficient and notationally compact algorithm thateffectively diagonalizes the problem of rangecorrelation in the datasamples coming from the pulse deconvolution filter. In effect, theharmonic basis function set used to express the rangedependenceacts as an approximation to a KarhunenLoeve KL expansion.  Theeigenvalues of the KL expansion for each wavelength are estimated bymaximum likelihood from the output of the deconvolution filter usingbackground calibration data.In parallel to the estimation and detection algorithm work, research iscurrently underway to develop an aerosol classifier using the spectralbackscatter estimates as feature vectors.  Support vector machinesSVM are the most promising technology for this purpose.  Theydirectly approximate the optimal Bayes classifier without the need forestimating conditional probability densities as an intermediate step.SVM classifiers offer the potential for computationally efficient, largemargin classifiers with excellent generalization performance on unseendata.An extensive set of data has been collected by ECBC using the FALFrequencyAgile Lidar sensor during JBSDS fieldtesting at DugwayProving Ground over the past two years.  The spectral backscatterestimates from this data serve as training and testing samples for SVMclassifier development.  The paper describes examples of the reducedbackscatter estimates and the performance of multicategory SVMclassifiers trained and tested with this data.655431, Session 5Bayesian probabilistic approach for inverse sourcedetermination from limited and noisy chemical orbiological sensor concentration measurementsE. Yee, Defence Research and Development Canada SuffieldCanadaAlthough a great deal of research effort has been focused on theforward prediction of the dispersion of contaminants e.g., chemical andbiological warfare agents released into the turbulent atmosphere, muchless work has been directed on the inverse prediction of agent sourcelocation and strength from the measured concentration, even thoughthe importance of this problem for a number of practical applications isobvious. In general, the inverse problem of source reconstruction is illposed and unsolvable without additional information. It is demonstratedthat a Bayesian probabilistic inferential framework provides a naturaland logically consistent method for source reconstruction from a limitednumber of noisy concentration data. In particular, the Bayesianapproach permits one to incorporate prior knowledge about the sourceas well as additional information regarding both model and data errors.The latter enables a rigorous determination of the uncertainty in theinference of the source parameters e.g., spatial locations, emissionrate, release time, etc., hence extending the potential of themethodology as a tool for quantitative source reconstruction.A model or, sourcereceptor relationship that relates the sourcedistribution to the concentration data measured by a number of sensorsis formulated, and Bayesian probability theory is used to derive theposterior probability density function of the source parameters. Acomputational efficient methodology for determination of the likelihoodfunction for the problem, based on an adjoint representation of thesourcereceptor relationship, is described. The Bayesian inferentialmethodology for source reconstruction is validated against realdispersion data for two cases involving contaminant dispersion in highlydisturbed flows over urban and complex environments whereidealization of horizontal homogeneity andor temporal stationarity inthe flow cannot be applied to simplify the problem.655432, Session 5Binary shaped femtosecond pulses as amultidimensional tool for controlled molecularfragmentation and chemical recognitionI. Pastirk, Biophotonic Solutions, Inc. V. V. Lozovoy, T. C. Gunaratne,J. C. Shane, M. Dantus, Michigan State Univ.The highest importance for any method used in detection andrecognition of chemicals is its reliability of measurement. Ultimate goalsare minimal false positive and false negative alarms. The experimentalresults presented here on a set of chemical war agent simulants paranitrotoluene and dimethylphosphite and mixtures, approach theproblem of designing a dependable chemical detection tool by using aset of binary, spectralphase shaped femtosecond laser pulses tocontrol the outcome of molecular fragmentation in a massspectroscopy setup. Control of the fragmentation pathways initiated byphaseshaped laser pulses is achieved by utilizing the nonlinear opticalresponse of the sample through the multiphoton intrapulse interference.In presented experiment a set of 2n where n is 810 binaryshapedpulses are used in a sequence for fragmentation of the sample andtimeofflight mass spectra are recorded. Different fragmentationpathways are result of a highly sensitive quantummechanicalinteraction of shaped ultrashort pulse and a sample molecule. A smallersubset of results is then selected to form a database and serve as afingerprint of a sample molecule where each different pathwayrepresents additional dimension of analysis.Binary phaseshaped pulses have advantage over other phaseshapingapproaches i.e. geneticalgorithm based closed loops as they are fastmeasuring a response of a sample while building a database for athousand different binary shapes takes minutes, while actual detectiononce database is acquired is only several seconds, easily reproducedand cause either constructive or destructive interference betweencompeting outcomes therefore enabling a scientific analysis ofunderlying fragmentation mechanisms.655433, Session 5Biomolecule sensors using highQ microring resonatorsE.

J. Bohn, M. A. Lundin, Air Force Institute of TechnologyPhase Fluorimetry, or Frequency Domain FD Fluorimetry, is atechnique which capitalizes on the phase delay from excitationmodulation of fluorescentmedia and offers independence from light scatter and excitationemission intensity variations in order to extract the lifetime of thesample. Samples which fluoresce in the UV are commonly excited withUV laser sources, which are not necessarily high power, portabledevices. Mercury vapor lamps, a common source of industrial facilitylighting, emit wavelengths 365 nm, 405 nm, and 436 nm that overlapthe UVblue spectrum and may be used as an efficient and portableexcitation source. The absorption spectrum of UO22 390450 nm, its high quantum yields, and long lifetime enable FDfluorimetry to be utilized. The phase angle given by tanf  wt andexcitation demodulation m  1w2t212 are easily detected by thismethod. Using t  85s and t  600s, the phase difference wouldrange between 0032 0189 rad s1 and 02220935 rad s1respectively. Mercury vapor lamps show strong peak intensities at 120Hz and higher harmonics, however, intensities at these harmonics varywith frequency. For this research effort, single exponential decay will beassumed and lifetimecalculation will be performed by least squares analysis with correctionsmade for lamp intensity variations at harmonics. This research effort willdemonstrate FD fluorimetry as an effective detection technique to utilizean excitation source modulated at multiple frequencies at once, which to our knowledge is a newmethod.Data for this method will include the use of a mercury vapor lamp,modulated by facility power, as the excitation source for both willemite,a naturally occurring crystal with similar characteristics, and a samplecontaining uranium.655502, Session 1Design and development of ultranarrow bandpasstunable photoniccrystal interferometers for visible andinfrared spectral domainsV. B. Markov, A. Khizhnyak, MetroLaser, Inc. W. B. Cook, NASALangley Research Ctr.Ultranarrow bandpass tunable filters are critical for the remote sensingindustry, highresolution spectroscopy, multispectral and hyperspectralimaging. This report presents the results on the analysis andengineering of such filters for visible and infrared spectral regions withtheir design based on the unique features of a photonic crystalinterferometer PCI. An optimal choice of the parameters of the PCIcomponents and its high finesse 200 enable to achieve an ultranarrow bandpass f with a broadband tunability F in visible and IRspectral regions with the ration fF  100.The stringent air or space borne operational conditions of the PCIrequires for systems high thermomechanical stability  the subject ofspecial interest that was performed based upon the finite elementanalysis. In order to optimize system performance and satisfy therequirements for practical exploitation such an analysis for the visibleand IR modules, respectively, was made for the room and lowtemperature operational conditions.In this report, along with the information on the PCI development, wepresent the results of tests and validation of its performance at variousoperational conditions, from the lab to field testing.655503, Session 1Highefficiency UV laser for spacebased wind lidarF. E. Hovis, Fibertek, Inc. J. Wang, Raytheon Santa Barbara RemoteSensingTropospheric winds data remains a high priority yet unmetEnvironmental Data Record EDR for the US National Polar OrbitingEnvironmental Satellite System NPOESS.  Direct detection Dopplerwind lidar systems have been demonstrated to be capable of providingmeasurements of wind velocities in clear air regions of the atmosphere,an important component of this unmet need.  The relatively smallwavelength shift and strong inverse wavelength dependence of themolecular backscattering signal require that a single frequency UV lasertransmitter be incorporated into this type of lidar system.  For anyspacebased application, high efficiency is a key system level designgoal.  We have been actively developing the required UV lasertransmitter.Our approach uses a singlefrequency NdYAG master oscillatorpoweramplifier as the primary pump source.  The system is diode pumpedand conductively cooled for compatibility with spacebased operation.We use a variation of the ramp and fire technique to injection seed themaster oscillator.  The spacequalifiable electronics provide user controlof the injection seeding, diode pump power, and operational modes ofthe laser.  The 1064 nm laser transmitter has been demonstrated toachieve a true system level wall plug efficiency of 6.4 for a qswitchedoutput power of 44 W at 50 Hz.  We use high efficiency doubling andsum frequency mixing of the 1064 nm pump to generate 24 W of 355nm output.  This result implies a third harmonic optical to opticalgeneration efficiency of 55 and a system level efficiency of 3.5.  Ourpresentation will provide the details of how these results were achieved.655504, Session 1Incoherent scattered lidar from nearspaceT. H. Zurbuchen, Univ. of Michigan P.

Swoish, Univ. ofMichiganThere is an important need for accurate measurements of troposphericwind altitude profiles. These windsystems have long been recognizedas one of the primary unknowns limiting weather forecasting over timescales of several days. Typical measurement architectures have focusedprimarily on spacebased based approaches, using a highpowered andhighly effective LIDAR system.This paper discusses mission architectures for nearspace missions thatare both spaceborn and carried by a highaltitude airship. Thearchitectures are analyzed in the context of a weather forecastingsystem for the Gulf of Mexico region during hurricane season. Thearchitecture studies were developed by collaboration between a classof engineers who are part of The University of Michigans new SpaceEngineering program and Michigan Aerospace Corporation, a Universityof Michigan spinoff company specializing, in part, in LIDAR systems.655505, Session 1Optical sensing atmospheric emissions from cubesatsand nanosats at Univ. of Illinois with Taylor Univ.collaborationG.

G. Hassebrook, C. J. Casey, V. Yalla, Q. Hao, D. L. Lau, Univ. ofKentuckyWe present an eight million point structured light illumination scannerdesign. To our knowledge, it has the highest potential single patch,projection resolution of any scanner at 12,000 lines along the phasedirection. The configuration consists of a custom Boulder NonlinearSystems Spatial Light Modulator for the projection system and dual fourmega pixel digital video cameras. The camera field of views are tiledwith minimal overlap region and a potential capture rate of 24 framesper second. We will report on various performance characteristics of thesystem. These characteristics will include the measured spatial systemresolution on flat surfaces. Discussion of optical limitations, capturesynchronization and system frame rate will also be discussed. Systemwill be evaluated with the multipattern, multifrequency phasemeasuring profilometry technique already published by our group. Weexpect a typical 3D capture rate of 1 point cloud 8 million points persecond but slower rates will produce higher signaltonoise ratios onthe depth measurements.655508, Session 2Multicamera phase measuring profilometry for accuratedistance measurementD. L. Lau, W. Wang, Univ. of KentuckyStructured ligh illumination refers to a scanning process of projecting aseries of striped patterns such that, when viewed from an angle, acamera is able to extract range information.  Ultimately, resolution indepth is controlled by the number of patterns projected which, in turn,increases the total time that the target object must remain still.  Byadding a second camera sensor, it becomes possible to not onlyachieve wrap around scanning but also reduce the number of patternsneeded to achieve a certain degree of depth resolution.  But a secondcamera also makes it possible to reconstruct 3D through stereovisiontechniques and triangulation between the cameras instead of betweenthe cameras and the projectors.  Specifically in this paper, we willanalyze the resulting stereovision depth accuracy as a function of thenumber of structured patterns as well as analyze the resulting depthaccuracy when fusing the surfa e recconstructions between all camerasas well as with the projector.655509, Session 2Composite pattern demodulation and post processing bymeans of stereo visionD. L. Lau, K. Liu, Univ. of KentuckyStructured light illumination generally refers to the scanning process ofprojecting a series of striped patterns onto a surface such that therange of the object is determined by the distortion in the pattern whenviewed at an angle for the projector.  Composite patterns are atechnique of applying frequency modulation to the individual strippedpatterns such that multiple SLI patterns are combined into a single,continuously projected pattern and where depth is determined by firstdemodulating a single captured image.  As such, SLI can now be usedfor acquiring depth video, but the resulting video shows significantdistortion near discontinuities in depth and texture.  This bandwidthlimitation has successfully been addressed previoulsy be means ofstereovision processing between the captured image with theprojected composite pattern, but realtime processing has never beenachieved.  In this paper, we will look at processing the captured,composite pattern image using stereovision algorithms performed onthe graphics processing unit of a commodity 3D video card, andthrough this, we hope to achieve realtime performance on the order of1015 fps.655510, Session 2Spacebased active optical zoomD.

In order tomeet these stringent requirements, the military needs revolutionaryalternatives to conventional imaging systems.We will present recent progress in active optical aka nonmechanicalzoom for space applications.  Active optical zoom uses multiple activeoptics elements to change the magnification of the imaging system.  Inorder to optically vary the magnification of an imaging system,continuous mechanical zoom systems require multiple optical elementsand use fine mechanical motion to precisely adjust the separationsbetween individual or groups of elements.  By incorporating activeelements into the optical design, we have designed, demonstrated, andpatented imaging systems that are capable of variable opticalmagnification with no macroscopic moving parts.655511, Session 3Advancements in pose determination for spaceoperationsJ.

Se, P. Jasiobedzki, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.Canada R. P. Wildes, York Univ. CanadaServicing satellites in space requires accurate and reliable 3Dinformation. Such information can be used to create virtual models ofspace structures for inspection geometry, surface flaws, deployment ofappendages, estimation of relative position and orientation of a targetspacecraft during autonomous docking or satellite capture, replacementof serviceable modules, detection of unexpected objects and collisions.Existing space vision systems rely on assumptions to achieve thenecessary performance and reliability. Future missions will require visionsystems that can operate without visual targets, under less restrictedoperational conditions towards full autonomy.Our vision system uses stereo cameras with pattern projection andsoftware to obtain reliable and accurate 3D information.  It can processimages from cameras mounted on a robotic arm endeffector on aspace structure or a spacecraft.  Image sequences can be acquiredduring relative camera motion, during flyaround of a spacecraft ormotion of the arm.   The system recovers the relative camera motionfrom the image sequence automatically without using spacecraft or armtelemetry.  The 3D data computed can then be integrated to generate acalibrated photorealistic 3D model of the space structure.Featurebased and shapebased approaches for camera motionestimation have been developed and compared.  Imaging effects onspecular surfaces are introduced by space materials and illumination.With a pattern projector and redundant stereo cameras, the robustnessand accuracy of stereo matching are improved as inconsistent 3Dpoints are discarded.  Experiments in our space vision facility showpromising results and photorealistic 3D models of scaled satellitereplicas are created.655514, Session 3Developing a pose estimation system development forHubble space telescope servicing missionJ.

By using a coherent heterodyne method,the benchtop receiver has achieved a link rate of 2.5 Gbs with a BitError Rate of 1e9 with a sensitivity of 43 dBm.  This receiver could beused as a critical component of a freespace optical link, where thelarge distances and power limitations necessitate a high sensitivity.Optical communications links provide tremendous bandwidth and canachieve data rates two orders of magnitude higher that an RFcommunications link.

The education of such engineers andscientists typically revolves around fundamental knowledge of basicimportant technologies, such as the mechanics relevant to orbitdesign,structures, avionics, and many others. A few years ago, the Universityof Michigan has developed a Masters of Engineering program thatprovides students with skills that are not taught as part of a typicalengineering curriculum. This program is focused on open problemsolving, space systems, and space policy, as well as other classes thatfurther their understanding of the connections between technologiesand the nontechnical aspects of managing a space mission.  The valueof such an education is tremendously increased through a directconnection to industry.  An innovative problemoriented approach hasbeen developed, which enables direct connections between industryand classroom teaching.

Sandau, U. Dombrowski, Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft undRaumfahrt e.V. GermanyHigh resolution mapping systems follow the trend to smaller groundsample distances GSD making use of the best technology available atthe given time. From the 80 m GSD of ERTS in 1972, the GSD nowapproached 1 m and even less for civil applications. Mass and powerconsumption of spacecrafts and imaging instruments follow similartrends in conjunction with the immense improvements in very diversfields of technology. SAR systems are an alternative to passive opticalsystems they also benefit from the technology improvements. But themost promising prospects for high resolution mapping with smallsatellites are connected with passive optical systems. The paper gives aMTF based metrics and analytical method to assess how far we can gowith decreasing instrument size and decreasing the GSD at the sametime and what features the spacecraft needs to provide. In this contextthe paper deals with such important parameters for topographicmapping with small satellites like spatial resolution, radiometry, datavolume and data transmission rate, pointing accuracy and stability. It isshown that the imagers as well as the spacecraft bus need to followcertain rules to allow high resolution imaging aboard of small satellites.655524, Session 5Autonomous docking experiments using the SPHEREStestbed inside the ISSS.

T. Lu, T. Chao, A. P. Thakoor, Jet Propulsion Lab. C. Snapp,NASA Johnson Space Ctr. T. Bechtel, Enviroscan, Inc. S. I. Ivashov,I. A. Vasilyev, Bauman Moscow State Technical Univ. RussiaThe disastrous loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia, as well as evenmore recent dangerous incidents that were thankfully resolved, havearoused interest in interferometric microwave radar devices for nondestructive testing and evaluation of the Space Shuttle ThermalProtection System, the external fuel tank insulating foam, materials andstructures on the shuttle, and other air and space vehicles.Experiments have been carried out to evaluate holographic subsurfaceradar RASCAN for nondestructive evaluation NDE of subnominalbond conditions between the Space Shuttle Thermal Protection Systemtiles and the aluminum substrate. The characteristic feature of thisdevice is the ability to obtain onesided radar soundingsimages withhigh sensitivity and high resolution in the frequency band of 3.64.0GHz.   Initial results have shown detection of small voids and spots ofdisbonding between Space Shuttle thermal protection tiles andunderlying aluminum substrate.   The holographic return signal forms ahighresolution image that shows the effect of improper bonding due tocontamination, water moisture, and air separation under 1  2 inchesthick tiles.  Image processing methods to extract defects will bediscussed. Potential applications of this technology for inflight nondestructive inspection of structure health of spacecrafts will bepresented.The research described in this paper was carried out by the JetPropulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under acontract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.655529, Session 8An efficient systematic method for system sensorsoptimization and analysisA. Fijany, F. Vatan, E. Barroth, Jet Propulsion Lab.We present a new efficient algorithmic method for system sensorsoptimization and analysis.  At the design stage, where the number andposition of sensors need to be determined, this methodology providesan optimal system of sensors which satisfies the design requirementswhile minimizing the sensor resources. For a given system with a set ofsensors, it would provide an extensive analysis of sensors capability forsystem monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis. This analysis wouldprovide following capabilities a Determination of systemsdiagnosability, i.e., the set of faults that can be covered and isolated bDetermination of sensors sensitivity, i.e., the impact of any sensor losson the system diagnosability c Improving systems monitoring,diagnosis, and prognosis by providing a direct relation between a givenfault and a subset of sensors reading.The quality and efficiency of any Fault Detection and Diagnosis FDDtool depends on the availability and relevance of the information that itcan retrieve from the sensors system. In fact, current approaches tosystems sensors design and selection are rather ad hoc and do notfully consider the impact of the sensors on the ability to detect faultsand diagnoseprognose the system. Obviously, if the relevantinformation is not provided by the sensors then the system cannot befully diagnosedprognosed, no matter the efficiency and accuracy of thedeployed tools. Our proposed approach enables filling this technologygap by providing the capability to directly relate sensors optimizationand analysis to systems monitoring and diagnosisprognosis. Ourapproach combines our two developed technologies on sensorsoptimization and analysis and on efficient modelbased diagnosis. As aresult, not only it provides a capability for a better design optimizationbut it also provides unique and significant new capabilities for systemmonitoring, and diagnosisprognosis.655530, Session 8Stable 600 oC silicon carbide MEMS pressuretransducersR. S. Okojie, NASA Glenn Research Ctr.We report thermally stable silicon carbide SiC piezoresistive pressuretransducers that have been reproducibly operated over time at 600 C1112 F without significant parametric degradation.  These transducersnow extend pressure measurement further into the higher temperatureenvironment beyond previously possible and provides three immediatesignificant technological benefits i wider frequency bandwidthovercomes acoustic attenuation associated with pitot tube, iiaccuracy stable output, and iii reduced packaging complexity nocooling tubes.  Operation at 600 C provides immediate applications inmilitary and commercial super and hypersonic engines in which criticalstatic and dynamic pressure measurements are performed to improveengine performance i.e., reduced emission, reduced noise, improvedCFD code validation.The SiC pressure sensor is based on multiuser SiC MEMS bulk microfabrication technology while the packaging is based on the NASApatented MEMS Direct Chip Attach MEMSDCA technique.  Thepackaging technique eliminates the need for wirebonding and allowsthe sensor chip to be flipmounted and attached directly to externalwires.  The flexibility associated with the packaging allows the subpackage to be inserted into preexisting standard stainless steelhousing, thereby eliminating the need for fixtures.  Pressure transducerfailures at high temperature are largely due to the degradation of thewirebond interface with the sensor, particularly with the additionalConf. 6555 Sensors and Systems for Space Applications166 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsspresence of vibration.  The MEMSDCA technique significantly reducesbond failure since the entire component parts have closely matchedcoefficient of thermal expansion and are rigidly connected.655552, Session 8Fiber optic sensor technologies for detection ofhydrogen in space applicationA. A. Kazemi, The Boeing Co. K. Goswami, InnoSense LLCOptical hydrogen sensors are intrinsically safe since they produce noarc or spark in an explosive environment caused by the leakage ofhydrogen.  Safety remains a top priority since leakage of hydrogen in airduring production, storage, transfer and distribution creates anexplosive atmosphere for concentrations between 4 vv  the lowerexplosive limit LEL and 74.5 vv  the upper explosive limit UEL atroom temperature and pressure. Being a very small molecule, hydrogenis prone to leakage through seals and microcracks.  Hydrogendetection in space application is very challenging public acceptance ofhydrogen fuel would require the integration of a reliable hydrogen safetysensor.  For detecting leakage of cryogenic fluids in spaceport facilities,Launch vehicle industry and NASA are currently relying heavily on thebulky mass spectrometers, which fill one or more equipment racks, andweigh several hundred kilograms.  An optical sensor system candecrease pay load while monitoring multiple leak locations in situ and inreal time.  Presentation will be made to discuss various designs ofoptical hydrogen sensors and their relative merits being used at EvolvedExpandable Lunch Vehicle EELVDelta IV Program and NASA fieldapplications.655532, Session 9Algorithm development for autonomous assemblydemonstrationsN. R. Hoff III, S. Mohan, S. Nolet, D. W. Miller, MassachusettsInstitute of TechnologyOnorbit servicing and assembly is a critical enabling technology for theadvancement of large scale structures in space.  The goal of theSWARM project is to develop and mature algorithms for autonomousdocking and reconfigurations, to be used as the building blocks forautonomous servicing and assembly.  Algorithms for approach,docking, and reconfiguration have been implemented and testedthrough a demonstration of the assembly of two telescope subapertures at Marshall Space Flight Center in July 2006.  The algorithmsdeveloped for reconfiguration sets the mass properties based on theconfiguration.  Updatable parameters include the location of sensorsand receivers with respect to the geometric center, thruster locationswith respect to the center of gravity, and control gains specific to eachconfiguration.  In order to test these algorithms in a 2D environment, aground testbed was developed that enables multiple docking ports andmodular payload attachments.  Hardware components include Nodes,UDPs, Posts, subaperture mirrors, and corresponding electronics.  ASPHERES satellite was used as the assembler tug that moves thesepieces into the desired configuration.  Testing results from MSFC showgood rendezvous and docking performance.  Reconfiguration wasdemonstrated as well, but full functionality is dependent on goodcontrol after docking.  Maneuvering after docking has slightly lesserperformance due to limited control authority when the CG is outside thethruster envelope.  Further algorithm development includes updatingthe controller to account for if the CG is outside the thruster envelope.655533, Session 9Autonomous precision formation flying a proposed faulttolerant attitude control strategyK. Khorasani, T. Jiang, Concordia Univ. CanadaFuture space missions, such as those involving formation flying ofmultiple satellites require high operation autonomy mainly with the aimof reducing the operation costs and improving reactivity to sensed data.In particular, the stringent performance requirements envisaged in theprecision formation flying cannot be achieved by currently availabletechnologies. One of the main challenges in achieving autonomy is thecapability of fault management without extensive involvement of groundstation operators.Within the fault diagnosis research community, fault detection andisolation have been researched extensively, although few efforts havebeen made in the domain of autonomous fault tolerant systems forformation flight of satellites. In this paper, a fault tolerant attitude controlstrategy is proposed, where nonlinear sliding mode observers areutilized to reconstruct the actuator faults present in the attitude controlsystem as opposed to merely detecting the presence of faults.Furthermore, the proposed system will incorporate the fault estimatesand take them into account to autonomously reconfigure the controlalgorithms for maintaining the attitude control objectives andrequirements.In the simulation results presented, a formation flight with four satellitesflying along a sunsynchronous orbit is considered. The leaderfollowerformation control approach is utilized to maintain the relative attitudesamong the satellites. Concurrently, a specific relative attitude of theleader with respect to the earth has also to be maintained. Majorattitude perturbations and disturbances such as gravitygradienteffects, the Earths magnetic field, aerodynamic torques and solarradiation torques are also included in the simulations.  The simulationresults show that the attitude objectives for the precision formationflying may be achieved autonomously by our proposed fault tolerantcontrol strategy even in the presence of actuator faults.655535, Session 9SUMOFREND vision for unaided spacecraft grapplingJ. L. Obermark, Jr., Naval Research Lab. and DCS Corp. W. J.Wagner, Naval Research Lab. and Honeywell Corp. C. G. Henshaw,Naval Research Lab.The SUMOFREND mission calls for a utility tug spacecraft to grapple acustomer spacecraft to execute an orbit modification.  This grapplingtask presents a number of technical challenges.  The customerspacecraft may be one of several broad types of GEO satellite and isnot expected to cooperate with the grapple operation.  In this paper wewill describe the machine vision aspects of this grappling task and ourpreliminary designs to provide a solution.The customer satellite does not have any artificial visual targets orbeacons to guide the SUMOFREND craft in grappling.  Our task isidentify features common to a broad class of potential customersatellites that are amenable to tracking.  The GEO space environmentpresents a number of challenges to the task, from lighting conditions tosensor and processor limitations.We will identify and test an image processing system that locates andtracks visual features in real time conditions to accomplish the satellitegrapple and capture. Rapid feedback from the tracking is critical tomaintaining the relative position of the spacecraft.  The system must beaccurate enough to ensure a solid grapple on the satellite to bind thetwo spacecraft together as needed for a successful mission.655536, Session 10Quantifying an imagery systems performance withtransformational mission data analysisA. W. Mauck, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc.Traditionally, the performance of an intelligence imagery collectionsystem is quantified by a satisfaction percentage.  The missionsatisfaction is the number of images collected divided by the number ofimages requested.  This paradigm assumes the information needed isgenerated from the collected imagery data if the data is delivered ontime.  As persistent surveillance requirements become more prominent,the time sequence of data collection is increasingly important.  Thesatisfaction percentage is not wholly descriptive of a collection systemsability to complete persistent surveillance missions.    A metric ofimagery data utility that is dependent on the time sequence of datacollected and the timeliness of data delivered is necessary.Booz Allen Hamiltons transformational mission analysis focuses onadditional metrics to characterize satisfaction of persistent surveillanceConf. 6555 Sensors and Systems for Space Applications spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 167requirements.  Surveillance missions are based on a need to monitor anactivity or event.  The observables are animate, and may require a timesequence of images.  For surveillance imagery data to be useful, thesystem must collect the data in required sequence and deliver theinformation in a timely fashion.  Booz Allen defines a utility score toquantify system performance against persistent surveillance missions.The utility score includes the satisfaction percentage, but is sensitive tothe time dependences of data.This paper outlines a transformational approach to mission analysis.The paper introduces examples of persistent surveillance missions, andthe limited value of satisfaction percentage.  It defines datarelationships between imagery system capabilities and surveillancemissions.  Finally, it computes the utility score, and quantifies theperformance of an example collection system.655538, Session 10Modeling of electrostatically actuated twoaxis tiptiltMEMS micromirrors for laser beamsteeringC. L. Edwards, B. G. Boone, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab.C. C. Davis, Univ. of MarylandCollege ParkThe availability of recently developed MEMS micromirror technologyprovides an opportunity to replace macroscale actuators for freespacelaser beamsteering in lidar and communication systems.  Such anapproach is under investigation at the Johns Hopkins University AppliedPhysics Laboratory for use on spacebased platforms.  Precisionmodeling of mirror pointing and its dynamics are critical to optimaldesign and control of MEMS beamsteerers. Beginning with Hornbeckstorque approach, this paper presents a first principle, analyticallyclosedform torque model for an electrostatically actuated twoaxistiptilt MEMS structure.  An Euler dynamic equation formulationdescribes the gimbaled motion as a coupled pair of damped harmonicoscillators with a common forcing function.  Static physical parameterssuch as MEMS mirror dimensions, facet mass, and height are input tothe model as well as dynamic harmonic oscillator parameters such asdamping and restoring constants fitted from measurements.  A Taylorseries expansion of the torque function provides valuable insights intobasic one dimensional as well as two dimensional MEMS behavior,including operational sensitivities near pullin.  The model also permitsthe natural inclusion and analysis of pointing noise sources such aselectrical drive noise, platform vibration, and Brownian molecularmotion.  Commercialofftheshelf micromirror measurements confirmthe models validity.  SimuLink simulations illustrate performancesensitivities, controllability, and physical limitations which are importantconsiderations in the design of optimal pointing systems.655539, Session 10A lowcost testbed for realtime landmark trackingC. Assad, Jet Propulsion Lab. J. C. Hanan, Oklahoma State Univ.A. Csaszar, P. Moreels, California Institute of Technology C. L.Hughlett, Zion Labs. Inc. T. Chao, Jet Propulsion Lab. P. Perona,California Institute of TechnologyA low cost vehicle testbed system was developed to iteratively test,refine and demonstrate algorithms before attempting to transfer thealgorithms to more advanced rover prototypes.  The platform used herewas a modified radio controlled RC car.  A microcontroller board wasinserted between the RC receiver and the motor controllers.  It allowsthe passing of RC commands that are received from the remoteoperator or computer, or to modify or substitute motor commandsgenerated by the computer.  The sensors in these vehicles represent thetypes currently used on NASAJPL rover prototypes.  For deadreckoning sensing, optical wheel encoders, a single axis gyroscope,and 2axis accelerometer were used.  An ultrasound ranger is availableto calculate distance as a substitute for the advanced stereo visionsystems presently used on rovers.  The prototype Figure 1 also carriesa small laptop computer with a USB camera and wireless transmitter tosend real time video to an offboard computer.  A realtime user interfacewas implemented that combines an automatic feature selector, trackingparameter controls, streaming video viewer, and user generated orautonomous driving commands.  Using the testbed realtime landmarktracking was demonstrated by autonomously driving the vehiclethrough the JPL Mars yard.  The algorithms stably tracked rocks andgenerate coordinate data from which to calculate relative motion andvisually servo to waypoints or science targets.  The limiting stage for thecurrent system is serial computingeach additional landmark is trackedin orderbut, since each landmark is tracked independently, iftransferred to appropriate parallel hardware, adding targets would notsignificantly diminish system speed.655540, Session 10Flight robotics laboratory testing of optical sensors forautomated rendezvous and dockingR. T. Howard, NASA Marshall Space Flight Ctr. J. D. Mitchell, S. P.Cryan, NASA Johnson Space Ctr. N. S. Johnston, L. Brewster, M.Williamson, NASA Marshall Space Flight Ctr. D. Strack, OdysseySpace Research, LLCMany of the missions in NASAs Exploration Systems Architecturerequire the use of Automated Rendezvous and Docking ARD ofspacecraft with either the International Space Station or with otherspacecraft.  An important part of an ARD system is the sensor suitethat provides the chase vehicles GNC system with the information itneeds to successfully approach and dock with its target.  The ARDSensor Technology project was created to reduce the risk of sensordevelopment by increasing the maturation of various relative navigationsensor technologies and by improving NASA insight into the strengthsand weaknesses of different technologies.  Much of this work involvedtesting different optical sensors in a realistic environment to assess theircapabilities.  The testing was performed in the Flight RoboticsLaboratory at the Marshall Space Flight Center using an APAS mockupand docking target designed and built at Johnson Space Center.  Thetest program, different sensors, and results are presented.655541, Session 10New approach to analysis and new principle foroptimization of remote sensing systemsH. H. Asadov, A. T. Hajizadeh, M. J. Kerimov, A. A. Isayev,Azerbaijan National Aerospace Agency AzerbaijanThe proposed new approach to the analysis of remote sensing systemsis that such systems should be considered as transitional and fuzzyones and these two features are inseparable. This determination may begrounded by such wellknown fact that each of such systems is undereffect of many internal and external factors having random andsystematic character. Effects of random character lead to fuzziness ofRS systems, and effects of systematic character leads to transitionalregimes of RS systems. Taking into consideration of abovementionedwe have developed the new multistage principle for optimization of RSsystems which consists of 3 steps i Application of Gauss  Zeidelmethod ii Application of variation principle of optimization iiiApplication of classical mathematical analysis principle for finding ofextremums functions. The proposed principle makes it possible toevaluate the potential informativeness of RS systems taking intoconsideration above features of them.655542, Session 11Optimization of the design of systems that evolve overtime using neural networksM. K. Nolan, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyComputational design optimization is challenging when the number ofvariables becomes large. One method of addressing this problem is touse pattern recognition to decrease the solution space in which theoptimizer searches. Human common sense is used by designers tonarrow the scope of search to a confined area defined by patternsconforming to likely solution candidates. However, computerbasedoptimization generally does not apply similar heuristics. In this paper, aConf. 6555 Sensors and Systems for Space Applications168 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsssystem is presented that recognizes patterns and adjusts its search foroptimal solutions based on performance associations with thesepatterns. A design problem was selected that requires the optimizationalgorithm to assess designs that evolve over time. A small sensornetwork design is evolved into a larger sensor network design. Optimaldesign solutions for the small network do not necessarily lead tooptimal design solutions for the larger network. Systems that are wellpositioned to evolve have characteristics that distinguish themselvesfrom systems that are not wellpositioned to evolve. In this study, aneural network was able to recognize a pattern whereby flexible sensornetworks evolved more successfully than less flexible networks. Theoptimizing algorithm used this pattern to select candidate systems thatshowed promise for successful evolution. In this limited exploratorystudy, a genetic algorithm assisted by a neural network achieved betterperformance than an unassisted genetic algorithm did. In a Pareto frontanalysis, the assisted genetic algorithm yielded three times the numberof optimal nondominated solutions as the unassisted geneticalgorithm did. It realized these results in one quarter the CPU time. Thispaper uses a sensor network example to establish the merit of neuralnetwork use in multiobjective system design optimization and to lay abasis for future study.655543, Session 11Modeling and control of active gravity offloading fordeployable space structuresT. J. Bihl, Ohio Univ. and Air Force Research Lab. K. D. Pham, T. W.Murphey, Air Force Research Lab.Kinematics behavior of deployable space structures must be examinedthrough ground based testing to predict deployment in a microgravityenvironment.  In order to simulate the microgravity conditions a testarticle would experience in space, a method of counteracting the forcedue to gravity is required.  This is accomplished through gravity offloading, which introduces a force opposite and equal to the force ofgravity acting upon a test article throughout its deployment.  Currentgravity offloading methods are passive and suspend a test articlethrough counterweights or balloons with their movement forced due totheir physical coupling with a test article, introducing unwantedboundary conditions, such as inertia and sideloading from a testarticles transverse deployment.  Therefore, an active gravity offloadingmethod is being developed that will deploy simultaneously with a testarticle.  This method employs motorized carts with active load controland active position control based upon the lead angle of the offloadingtether.  The maximum allowable lead angle is designed to be 2.5, withthe intention of minimizing the forcing of the carts longitudinaldeployment.  Additionally, a test article will be permitted to deploynaturally along its transverse due to the active load controllers ability toapply constant, uniform support.655544, Session 11Nonlinear modeling and precise position control offlexible space manipulator jointX. Zhang, H. Sun, Q. Jia, Beijing Univ. of Posts andTelecommunications ChinaThis paper addresses problem on position control of a flexible spacemanipulator joint. For a joint equipped with flexible harmonic drive, itsperformance of motion control is considerably restricted by the inherentnonlinearity caused by friction and nonlinear stiffness, which isidentified as the main obstacles in obtaining high precision positioning.In this paper, a nonlinear model of flexible space manipulator joint is setup firstly, according to Harmonicderive stiffness model compliance iscompensated Secondly, LuGre friction model is used and an improvedobserverbased adaptive method is proposed for friction compensation.Computer simulations demonstrate that this approach is effective andcan obtain satisfactory tracking performance, steadystate accuracy,and improve lowspeed performance significantly compared withconventional PID control.655545, Session 11Differential game barrier model for orbiter under targetmaneuvering based on relative coordinatesQ. Zhang, Z. Zhou, S. Sun, Y. Sun, Harbin Institute of TechnologyChinaThe pursuitevasion game problem was analyzed by the qualitativedifferential game for space vehicle while the target is maneuvering,based on a system of orbit coordinates. The purpose is to obtain thepursuitevasion barrier under the maneuvering manner which control isprovided by varying the direction of thrust vector and the magnitude ofthrust vector is considered as constant value for both spacecrafts. Inconstructing the barrier, terminal conditions are one of key problems tobe solved under given capture criterion. This problem is solved by twotime parameterized equation, and the terminal critical position isobtained by the restricted formulation which is relative to thrust vectormagnitude, terminal relative velocity and capture radius. A set ofsolution of barrier are find by theorizing. From mathematical simulationit is verified that there are the barriers.655546, Session 11Differential game barrier model for spacecraft undertarget maneuvering based on minimum errorQ. Zhang, S. Sun, Y. Sun, Harbin Institute of Technology ChinaThis paper explores the pursuitevasion game of two spacecraft in lowcoplanar orbit under minute continuous thrust. Using differential gametheory, this study verifies terminal conditions confined by controlling,target set and velocity and gives the linear game model of minimumerror which is compared with nonlinear game model on sightcoordinate. The terminal conditions are fixed by constructing parameterequations set which are obtained after coordinate transformation andby the optimal controlling strategy for both spacecraft. Within theequations set linearized, there are variable parameters which areassociated with the linearization process. Using differential game ofkind theory, this paper obtains the expression of the barrier with thevariable parameters to be established. According to extremum theory ofthe minimum error, the parameters to be established are achieved. Thispaper gives the results of theoretical derivation and numericalsimulation.655547, Session 12Simulation study of a roboticsbased method for onorbitidentification of spacecraft inertia propertiesO. Ma, New Mexico State Univ. K. D. Pham, Air Force ResearchLab. H. Dan, New Mexico State Univ.The inertia properties i.e., mass, location of mass center, inertia tensorof a spacecraft can change in orbit for many reasons such as fuelconsumption, fuel transfer, hardware reconfiguration, payloaddeployment, capturing a flying object satellite, docking with anotherspacecraft, or some mechanical malfunctions like an unexpecteddeployment problem. In many missions the inertia properties of theinvolved spacecraft need to be known. For example, stateestimate andcontrol systems need to know correct inertia parameters spacevehicles need to know how much fuel remains a servicing spacecraftneeds to know the inertia of the target satellite that it captured ordocked to in order to stabilize the compound system spacecraft needsto update its inertia parameters after deployment of appendages, etc.Therefore, it is desirable to identify the inertia properties of a flyingspacecraft whenever needed. To be acceptable by industry, suchtechnology has to not only solve the problem but also be reliable,efficient and economical.This paper describes a simulationbased study of a new method ofidentifying inertia properties of spacecraft in orbit. The method makesuse of an onboard robotic arm to change the inertia distribution of theentire spacecraft system. As the result of the redistribution of the inertia,the velocity of the spacecraft system will change correspondinglybecause of the conservation of momentum, as shown in Fig.1. TheConf. 6555 Sensors and Systems for Space Applications spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 169velocity change is measurable and the inertia change of the robotic armis predictable. This leaves the inertia properties of the spacecraft bodyas the only unknowns in the momentum equations. Therefore, theunknown inertia properties can be determined from a series ofmomentum equations corresponding to a series of changesmeasurements using standard system identification techniques. Thelargest advantages of this method are 1 it does not consume fuelbecause a robotic arm is energized by solar power 2 it requires tomeasure steadystate velocities only because the method is based onthe momentum conservation law 3 it will not be affected by internalenergy dissipation because of the momentum based approach. Inaddition, structural flexibility of the robot or satellite will not add muchdifficulty to the method because each measurement can always bedone after the structural oscillation dies down.For the simulation study, the dynamics model of a rigid satellite and a 6DOF robotic arm were implemented. All the kinematics and dynamics ofthe robotic arm are assumed to be known and the inertial properties ofthe satellite body are assumed unknown. By commanding the roboticarm to move to several different configurations and measuring theresulting linear and angular velocities changes, we can successfullyidentify the unknown inertia parameters of the satellite using themethod. It is interesting to see that the arm does not need to movesignificantly in order to identify all the unknown parameters. This givesus an hint that we may not have to use a 6DOF arm for the purpose.Some simple mechanisms such as a solar area may also be able to dothe job. We also investigated how the ratio of the arm mass over thesatellite mass affects the identification results. It turns out that theidentification result is not sensitive to the mass ratio unless a low massratio causes a larger measurement error. This means that a relativesmall arm may do a good job. An important investigation is to see howmeasurement errors affect the identification results. This was done byintroducing random errors into the measured velocity data. Thesimulation tests did show that errors in measurement may lead to largeidentification errors. This indicated that we need to introduce measuresto minimize identification errors caused by inevitable measurementerrors in practice. In general, the simulation results demonstrated thatthe proposed identification technology works very well in theory. Due totime limitations, no experiment test and verification have beenconducted so far. We have had good ideas about how to test thistechnology in lab environment, which will be our future work.The last interesting thing that we found from the simulation study is thatthe method may also work with a solar array instead of a 6DOF robotalthough a solar array has very limited manoeuvrability. This findingsupports our hypothesis that a solar array and perhaps another simplemechanism can also be used as a robot for identifying satellite inertia.Of course, this finding was only from a very preliminary simulation test.More indepth investigation is still needed in order to prove thishypothesis. If it is proven, the impact will be significant because most ofthe satellites have solar arrays but only very few are equipped with arobotic arm.655548, Session 12Online tribology ball bearing fault detection andidentificationB. Ling, Migma Systems, Inc. M. Khonsari, Louisiana State Univ.Successful operation of many precision machinery used in spaceinstruments require very stringent position accuracy  in the range ofmicrons. Theses systems must be designed to operate reliably with littleor no maintenance and long servicelife duration. This presents aformidable challenge to the designer since there is a severe paucity ofavailable information on enabling methods that would ensure properfunctioning of these systems. Under NASA funding, we have developeda system for the ball bearing fault detection and identification. Oursystem can effectively identify various fault modes related to theevolution of friction within the contact in the coated ball bearings. Dataare collected from lab experiments involving forces, torque andacceleration sensors. To detect the ball bearing faulty modes, we havedeveloped a new bispectrum and entropy analysis method to capturethe faulty transient signals embedded in the measurements. Test resultshave shown that this method can detect the small abnormal signalsassociated with the friction evolution. To identify the fault modes, wehave further developed a set of stochastic models using hidden Markovmodel HMM. Instead of using the discrete sequences, our HMMmodels can incorporate the feature vectors modeled as Gaussianmixtures. To facilitate online fault identification, we build an HMM modelfor each fault mode. At each evaluation time, all HMM models areevaluated and the final detection is refined based on Bayesianinference. Test results using lab experiment data have shown that oursystem can identify coated ball bearing fault modes in realtime.655549, Session 12Integration and test of a roboticsbased testbed forverifying contactdynamics parameter identificationtechnologyO. Ma, J. H. Kim, New Mexico State Univ.This paper describes the integration and preliminary test of a roboticsbased testbed designed for experimentally investigation and verificationof a systematic method for identifying key parameters of multiplepoint,frictional contactdynamics models.Some of the current and future flight systems will be required to makephysical contact in orbit such as the assembly of the InternationalSpace Station, repair and refueling of a satellite, spacecraft docking andcapturing, etc. Because of the high risk associated with contactoperations, the design and operation of such a flight system must bethoroughly analyzed and verified in advance by computer simulationsusing highfidelity multibody dynamics and contact dynamics models.The accuracy of such a dynamic simulation depends not only on themathematical model i.e., formulation, algorithms, and computer codebut also on the values of model parameters. Existing techniques ofidentifying contact parameters focus on measuring individualparameters from singlecontact scenarios and using highly specializedequipment and specimens. Such an approach is nonsystematic,specializedequipment and humanskill dependent, and very inefficient.The leading author of this paper and his Canadian collaboratorsproposed a systematic method which can identify key stiffness,damping, and friction parameters of a multipoint contact dynamicsmodel all together directly from hardware test of a mechanicalcomponent or assembly having complicated geometries 1. Themethod can be used to extract contactdynamics model parameters ofa dynamic system from its routine test of complex contact hardware. Itcan also be used to tune the dynamics simulation model of a spacesystem directly from its flight data. A simulation study of this methodshowed promising results 2. However, the method has not beenexperimentally verified. To be acceptable to the industry to make realimpact, the method has to be experimentally verified. A roboticsbasedtestbed has been designed at NMSU to experimentally test and verifythe abovementioned new identification method 3. This paper willintroduce the integration and some preliminary test results of thistestbed.References1 M. Weber, O. Ma, and I.

In thispaper, a new experiment concept is proposed, which is a hybridapproach, i.e. it combines the mathematical model with the physicalmodel. The key issues of the concept are dynamic emulation andkinematic equivalence. Dynamic emulation means that the behaviors ofthe whole space system, including space manipulator, its base and thetarget, are emulated by the precise dynamic equations. Kinematicequivalence means that the endeffector motion of the spacemanipulator is realized by the lab robot. Based on the concept, aground experiment system is set up, which is composed of twoindustrial robots, two handeye cameras, a set of global visual systemand a realtime 3D simulation system. Using the system, some keytechnologies are verified. Firstly, the motion prediction technology ofunknown target is studied. The target may move in various modes, suchas freefloating, tumbling, and so on. With the measurement of the haneye cameras, extended Kalman filter is used to estimate the motion ofthe target. Then, different visual servo control technologies areresearched, which include positionbased, imagebased and 2.5Dvisual servoing technology.

A. Kemme, A. CruzCabrera, P. Nandy, R. R. Boye, J. Wendt,Sandia National Labs. T. Carter, S. Samora, LM Technologies, Inc.We report on the design, fabrication, and simulation of a fourstatepixelated subwavelength optical device that enables midwave infraredMWIR or longwave infrared LWIR snapshot polarimetric imaging.The polarization information can help to classify imaged materials andidentify objects of interest for remote sensing and military applications.Traditionally, sequential polarimetric imaging sensors produce sceneswith polarization information through a series of assembled images.Snapshot polarimetric imaging collects the spatial distribution of all fourStokes parameters simultaneously.  In this way any noise due to scenemovement from one frame to the next is eliminated.In this presentation, we will quantify nearfield and diffractive effects ofthe finite pixel apertures upon detection.  We have designed and builtan experimental setup that models a pixel within a focal plane arrayFPA to measure crosstalk from adjacent gold wiregrid micropolarizers.This configuration simulates a snapshot polarization imaging devicewhere the two substrates are stacked micropolarizer array substrate ontop of an FPA.  Modeling and measured data indicate crosstalk betweenthe adjacent pixels even after a few microns behind the polarizer plane.Crosstalk between adjacent pixels increases uncertainty in themeasured polarization states in a scene of interest.  Measured andsimulated data confirm that the extinction ratio of a micropolarizer pixelin a supercell will be reduced by 17 when moving the FPA from only0.5 microns to 1.0 microns away from the polarizer.  These changes inextinction ratio are quite significant since typical glue separation is onthe order of 10 microns.655604, Session 1Distributed intelligence and cooperative monitoring forsensor networks in space applicationsY. Wen, A. Agogino, Univ. of CaliforniaBerkeleyMassive deployment of miniature sensors with integratedmicrocontrollers and communicational capabilities is being facilitated bythe progress of MEMS MicroElectromechanical Systemstechnologies. The small sizes of the sensors enable localizing detectionthat is suitable for application such as health monitoring of spaceshuttles or carriers to provide early warnings and prevent catastrophesin space missions. The integrated microcontrollers make in situprocessing possible, and the communicating capacities further allowcooperation among distributed sensor nodes.A cooperative monitoring mechanism for sensor networks incorporatingdistributed intelligence and comparative analysis of sensors isdescribed in this paper. Three hierarchical layers are processed andanalyzed for locating abnormalities single sensor nodes, local cluster ofsensors and the entire global sensor network. Each sensor node ismade intelligent by monitoring its own reliability, adjusting the sensingresolution dynamically upon irregular events, and determining itscomputational and communicating responsibilities under a probabilityframework. The readings from each sensor are fused locally andglobally using a fuzzy rulebased algorithm. The local fusion is carriedout by optimally elected sensor nodes in each local cluster, while theglobal fusion is executed on a central data aggregation unit with highercomputational power. As the irregular minority will be either rejected orlightly weighted in global fused value, the comparison between localand global fused values reveals the location of any potentialproblematic spots. The mechanism is verified on a small scaled sensornetwork composed of smart dust motes that simulates the detectionof the local raise of temperature referred to as a hot spot on the spaceshuttle surface insulating materials.655605, Session 1Piezoelectric micropower generation devices forautonomous remote sensor systemsD.

Yang, Stevens Institute of TechnologyActive wavefront control is required subsequent to reflection from theprimary mirror, particularly to overcome the potentially large spatialfrequency errors anticipated with Gossamer type structures.Development of new, lowmass technologies is essential for wavefrontcorrection for next generation optical instruments in Space.  Linearactuators are required to provide the fine shape correction of primaryapertures for future space telescopes.  There is considerable incentiveto develop miniaturized actuators.  Linear microactuator technologywith large linear motion has been demonstrated, and a continuousmembrane deformable mirror DM with a largestroke piezoelectricunimorph actuator array has been developed for this purpose.

Khoury, C. L. Woods, Air Force Research Lab. B. HajiSaeed, S.K. Sengupta, W. D. Goodhue, Univ. of MassachusettsLowell J.Kierstead, Solid State Scientific Corp.In this paper, for the first time Dynamic Range CompressionDeconvolution using our new designed nonlinear optical limiter MicroElectroMechanicalSystem NOLMEMS device is proposed. TheNOLMEMS utilizes aperturized reflected coherent light from opticallyaddressed deformable mirrors, deformed in a parabolic shape, which iscollimated by an array of microlenses. The reflected light saturate as afunction of optical drive intensity. In this scheme, a joint image of theblurred input information and the blur impulse response is captured andsent to a spatial light modulator SLM. The joint information on the SMLis read through a laser beam and is Fourier transformed via a lens to theback of the NOLMEMS device. The output from the NOLMEMS isFourier transformed to produce the restored image. We derived theinputoutput nonlinear transfer function of our NOLMEMS device thatrelates the transmitted light from the pinhole as a function of the lightintensity incident on the back side of the device, which shows asaturation dependency. We also analyzed the deconvolution orders forthis device using a nonlinear transform method.

Hajisaeed, G. Griffith, S. K. Sengupta, W. D. Goodhue, Univ. ofMassachusettsLowell J. Khoury, C. L. Woods, Air Force ResearchLab. J. Kierstead, Solid State Scientific Corp.In this paper the fabrication, modeling and characterization of an alloptically addressed spring patterned siliconnitride deformable mirrorMicroElectroMechanicalSystems MEMS device is reported. Thisdevice is biased through combinations of high frequency AC and DCvoltages. The experimentally verified theoretical modeling for this deviceshows mirror deflection saturation as a function of light intensityappropriate for dynamic range compression deconvolution. The springMEMS device has an advantage over conventional deformable mirrordevices such as segmented independently actuated rigid mirrors andmembrane mirrors with multiple actuators. The conventional deformablemirrors are generally bulky, and their response time is in the millisecondrange. This limits their performance to applications in correcting slowaberrations such as atmospheric turbulence. In contrast to thesedevices, the spring MEMS deformable mirror device has response up to10 MHz, which opens the possibility of correcting atmosphericturbulence as well as supersonic turbulence.655610, Session 2Active imaging systems using MEMS mirrorsB.

M. White, J. D. Suter, H. Zhu, H. Oveys, X. Fan, Univ. of MissouriColumbiaThe liquid core optical ring resonator LCORR sensor is a newlydeveloped capillarybased ring resonator that integrates microfluidicswith photonic sensing technology. The circular crosssection of thecapillary forms a ring resonator that supports whispering gallery modesWGM, which interact with the sample as it passes through thecapillary.  As in previous ring resonator sensor implementations, theinteraction between the WGM evanescent field and the sample enableslabelfree detection.With a prototype of an LCORR sensor, we have achieved a refractiveindex detection limit of 106 RIU and a detection limit for protein of 10pgmm2.  Several engineering developments have been accomplishedas well, including a thermal noise characterization, a thermalstabilization implementation, integration of the LCORR with an antiresonant reflecting optical waveguide array, and electrokinetic sampledelivery.  In the near future, the LCORR will be integrated into a dense2dimensional sensing array by integrating multiple capillaries with achipbased waveguide array.

L. Scott, C. Ma, G. Pickrell, A. Wang, Virginia Polytechnic Instituteand State Univ. T. Ooi, U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research,Development and Engineering Ctr.Effective response to potentially dangerous environmental situationsthat can arise requires accurate and real time data on the environmentthat is being monitored.  The ability to respond in an appropriate timeframe is determined by the sensitivity and response time of the methodused for monitoring. Fiber optic sensors have been used and arecapable of detecting chemical compounds within an environment,however the sensitivity and response time of this detection methodneeds to be improved for many sensing applications. Improving thesecharacteristics can be accomplished by developing an optical fibersensor with different structures. Through the introduction of newstructures and control of these structures, the sensitivity and responsetime can be designed for a specific application. We have developed anovel porous fiber optic that has potential applications in chemical andbiological agent sensing systems. Sensing capabilities of the opticalfiber are a result of the structure that is designed into the fiber. Thestructure of the fiber is described as are the characterization of the fiberand the characterization methods used. Methods used to describe thisnew fiber optic sensor include nitrogen absorption porosity data,scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and opticalcharacterizations. The structure of the optical fiber is produced byutilizing specific manufacturing and processing methods. Fabricationmethods and the processing steps that are used during the fiber opticproduction are also presented. Effect of altering processing conditionson the sensor structure is detailed and how this affects the performanceof the fiber.655613, Session 3Evanescent optical fluorescence excitation the role ofphotonic mode densityB. Menges, W. Knoll, MaxPlanckInstitut fr PolymerforschungGermanyThere is a growing nano technological demand for thin film preparationsespecially in the polymeric materials area, e.g. as thin lubricating,isolation or protective coatings, for integrated or nonlinear opticdevices, or to increase the biocompatibility of inorganic materials. Thishas stimulated the development of novel optical techniques withincreased sensitivity, specificity and spatial resolution. For interfacialproperties and thin film samples, the use of evanescent optics hasproved in recent years to be particularly helpful. This is because of theirhigh surface specificity, which allows sensitive monitoring of theproperties of the interfaces and thin layers without the interference ofinformation from the bulk. In this paper we discuss a few basicconcepts concerning to the use of the evanescent optical fields for theexcitation of fluorescent chromophores placed near the interface. Theobservation of enhanced fluorescence from chromophores excited bysurface and waveguide modes will be presented and discussed. Weattribute the enhancement to the nearfield interaction between thechromophores and the photonic mode density of surface andwaveguide modes. The importance of sensor configurations inproviding large changes in photonic mode density is highlighted.Furthermore we report on the development of a Micro Opto ElectroMechanical System MOEMS for the detection of surface plasmonresonance with a high potential for integration in systemonachiptechnology.655614, Session 3Highspeed nanooptical photodetector for free spacecommunicationR. M. Kurtz, K. A. Alim, R. D. Pradhan, V. Esterkin, G. D. Savant,Physical Optics Corp. J. E. Nichter, Air Force Research Lab. A. A.Balandin, Univ. of CaliforniaRiversideAn inexpensive, easily integrated, sensitive photoreceiver operating inthe communications band with a 50GHz bandwidth would revolutionizethe freespace communication industry.  While generation of 50GHzcarrier AM or FM signals is not difficult, its reception and heterodyningrequire specific, known technologies, generally based on siliconsemiconductors.  We present a 50 GHz photoreceiver that exceeds thecapabilities of current devices.  The proposed photoreceiver is basedon a technology we call Nanodust.  This new technology enables nanooptical photodetectors to be directly embedded in silicon matrices, orinto CMOS receptionheterodyning circuit.  Photoreceivers based onNanodust technology can be designed to operate in any spectralregion, the most important to date being the telecommunications bandnear 1.55 micrometers.  Unlike current photodetectors that operate inthis spectral region, Nanodust photodetectors can be directly integratedwith standard CMOS and siliconbased circuitry.  Nanodust technologylends itself well to normalincidence signal reception, significantlyincreasing the reception area without compromising the bandwidth.Preliminary experiments have demonstrated a freespace responsivityof 50 AWcm2, nearly an order of magnitude greater than thatoffered by current 50GHz detectors.  We expect to increase theNanodust responsivity by at least another order of magnitude inupcoming experiments.655615, Session 3Integrated optical microring for highresolution refractiveindex and pressure sensing applicationsS. Ja, Nomadics, Inc.Whisperinggallery mode WGM resonators such as microspheres,microcylinders, and microrings have been proposed fortelecommunication and sensing applications for decades.   However,several challenges, such as the robustness of the optical coupling andsample delivery means, were often found in the path of developingthem for the real world sensing applications.  In this paper, a robustmicroring platform based on integrated lightwave circuit technology anda tunable diode interrogation system has been demonstrated as highresolution refractive index and pressure measurement system.

Sumetsky, OFS Fitel, LLCAn optical microfiber MF is usually fabricated by drawing aconventional optical fiber down to the diameter of  1 micron. A MFwith the diameter significantly less than one micron is often called ananofiber. This paper considers optical MFnanofiber sensors, whichdetect changes in the ambient medium by monitoring changes intransmission power of light propagating along the MF. The MFrepresents a waist of a biconical fiber taper connected to a light sourceat one end and to an optical spectrum analyzer or a power meter at theother one. An electromagnetic field mode supported by a MF has anevanescent part, which is distributed outside the MF. The evanescentpart may be very sensitive to changes at or near the surface of the MF.The performance of the MF sensor can be either a not based or bbased on the interaction of the ambient medium with the evanescentfield.  First, the sensors of group a are briefly discussed. Thesesensors are MF devices, which transmission characteristics vary due tochanges in optical andor geometrical properties of the MF itself andorof the propagating mode inside the MF. The changes of this kind can becaused by the outside radiation heating the MF, ambient temperature,mechanical vibration, etc. An example of the first group of sensors is aMF loop resonator, which can be used as a fast direct contacttemperature sensor 1 and also as an infrared radiation sensor. Next,sensors of group b are considered. The simplest of them is a MF,which detects changes at a cylindrical surface of an optical fiber 2.Generally, performance of these sensors depends on the structure ofevanescent field of micro and nanotapers. This structure is investigatedherein using the recently developed theory 3 and numericalsimulations. The calculated dependencies of the transmission power ofa nanotaper are in a good agreement with the experimental data. Also,the MF sensor of group b, which supports more than one mode, isconsidered theoretically and experimentally. This sensor detectsambient changes with the evanescent field of a higher order mode,which couples to the fundamental mode.References1.M. Sumetsky, Y. Dulashko, J. M. Fini, A. Hale, and D. J.

T. Hastings, P. Bathae Kumaresh, J. Guo, D. Keathley, L. G.Bachas, S. Law, Univ. of KentuckySurface plasmon resonance SPR sensors are widely used to studybiological and chemical interactions.  As a result, they have defense andsecurity applications in the detection of agents ranging from smallmolecules to bacterial pathogens.   Because SPR sensors rely onrefractive index transduction, standard sensors cannot differentiatebetween bulk index changes in the analyte and surface bindingreactions of interest.  As a result, several techniques have beenproposed to provide reference measurements that compensate forinterfering effects.  However, these approaches rely on the interrogationof a separate reference region, often require duplicate readout systems,and can be difficult to calibrate.Recently, our group and others have investigated the simultaneousexcitation of two surface plasmon waves, the so called longrange andshortrange surface plasmons, to differentiate surface and bulk effects.The fields of the two waves penetrate to different depths in the analyteand thus exhibit different sensitivities to bulk and surface refractiveindex changes.  This approach is advantageous because the twosurfaceplasmons propagate over the same sensor region and can beinterrogated at different wavelengths using a single readout system.Here we describe the optimization of these sensors for both surfaceand bulk limits of detection, and we discuss an approach to nonlinearcalibration and data analysis that allows quantitative measurementsover a broader range of bulk refractive indices.  The performance ofthese sensors is demonstrated by monitoring alkanethiol selfassembled monolayer formation while varying solvent refractive indexand by monitoring streptavidinbiotin binding while varying bufferrefractive index.655618, Session 4Photonic transduction for microcantilever sensor arraysG. P. Nordin, S. Kim, J. Noh, Y. Qian, Brigham Young Univ.Microcantilevers show significant promise in sensing minute quantitiesof chemical and biological analytes in vapor and liquid media. Much ofthe reported work on microcantilever sensors has made use of singlefunctionalized microcantilevers, usually derived from commerciallyavailable atomic force microscope AFM cantilevers. However, arrayswith hundreds to thousands of microcantilevers on a single chip arerequired to create sophisticated, broad spectrum chemical andbiological sensors in which individual microcantilevers have differentbio or chemoselective coatings. Unfortunately, the most sensitivemicrocantilever readout mechanisms such as laser beam reflection asused in atomic force microscopy are not readily scalable to largearrays. We therefore introduce a new microcantilever transductionmechanism for silicononinsulator SOI microcantilevers that isdesigned to scale to large arrays while maintaining a very compact formfactor and high sensitivity. This mechanism is based on inplanephotonic transduction of microcantilever deflection in which themicrocantilever itself forms a single mode rib waveguide. Light from theend of the microcantilever is directed across a small gap to anasymmetric receiving waveguide with two outputs that enablesdifferential detection of microcantilever deflection. Fiber input andoutput with compact waveguide bend and splitter arrays are needed toroute light to and from the microcantilever array. Initial noise and opticalpower budget calculations indicate that deflection sensitivities in the10s of picometer range should be achievable.655619, Session 4Microfluidic device detection of waterborne pathogensthrough static light scattering of lateximmunoagglutination using proximity optical fibersJ. Yoon, J. Han, B. Heinze, L. J. Lucas, The Univ. of ArizonaThere have been many cases of accidental outbreaks of waterbornepathogens in drinking water or irrigation system. More recently,concerns have been raised on the use of bacteriaviruses as an act ofterrorism. These issues have compelled public health agencies todevelop new methods of early surveillance to waterrelated facilities.Current available methods involve the growth of pathogens in culturemedia in an analysis laboratory remote from the point of use, which isnot real time and not fully automated. Microfluidic device is expected toovercome all of these complications, although it has been usedrelatively rarely in water studies. The most recent attempts include themethods based on DNARNA detection or antibodybased ELISA,which still requires substantial amount of human labor, such as celllysing, incubation, rinsing, etc. We propose to use lateximmunoagglutination as fullyautomated, onestep detection method.However simple it appears to be, latex immunoagglutination in amicrofluidic device has not been demonstrated properly, because 1agglutinated particles could not be mixed efficiently in a microchannelstrict laminar flow and 2 nonspecific binding led to many falsepositive readings. We have resolved these problems by using highlycarboxylated submicron particles without surfactant to enhancediffusion as well as suppress nonspecific bindings.Immunoagglutination was quantified on the view cell of a microfluidicdevice, by either microscope imaging or static light scattering usingproximity optical fibers. All detections could be made within 5 min, andthe devices were reusable. The level of detection LOD was 50 ngmLfor antibodies and 150 cfumL for E. coli K12 compared with theConf. 6556 Micro MEMS and Nanotechnologies for Defense and Security spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 175conventional culturing method.

Shi, Shanghai Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics ChinaAt the foreend of 9th laser system of ShenGuang II facility, the tunableFP filter is adopted to dynamically compensate the FMAM effect inInertial Confinement Fusion ICF facility, the compensation range ofspectral bandwidth is determined by the spacing between two parallelglass plates of tunable FP filter. One glass plate is fixed, and the othermounted on the microdisplacement stage driven by piezoelectricactuators. Owing to inherent hysteresis and creep of piezoelectricceramic, the spacing between parallel plates undergoes changes slowlywith the elapsed time, so that the stability becomes deteriorative, andconsequently impacts the dynamic compensation functions of tunableFP filter.This paper brings forward a precise monitor system to stabilize thespacing of tunable FP filter. The monitor system consists of capacitivedisplacement sensor system and displacement control system,capacitive displacement sensor provides feedback signals for closeloop control, which detects the actual displacement between theparallel plates of FP filter, displacement deviation can be obtainedthrough the comparison between the actual displacement and the givenone with the help of computer. Digital PID control algorithm is applied tocalculate the displacement deviation and obtain the driving voltage thatpiezoelectric actuators need. According to the discrepancy,piezoelectric actuators drive microdisplacement stage to move andaccordingly alter the spacing of FP filter to initial value, consequentlyrealize closeloop displacement control of spacing, and eventuallyaccomplish the functions of dynamic compensation to FMAM effect.655622, Session 5Nanolithography of metal catalysts using dip pennanolithography DPNtmD. Banerjee, Texas AM Univ.DPNtm is a versatile technology that leverages microfluidic ink deliverysystems with Scanning Probe Microscopy. DPN applications areemerging in biotechnology, brand protection, photomask repair,molecular electronics, nanoelectronics and maskless lithography. DPNtechniques have been extensively used for deposition of metals andalloys. Metal salts or mixture of metal salts e.g., PdCl2, PtCl2 can bedeposited by DPN process in nanoarrays. Following the depositionstep  the metals salts can be reduced to their pure metallic state byvarious techniques. Metal salts of noble metals e.g., Pd, Pt can bereduced to elemental metals by heating the deposited pattern to theirdecomposition temperatures in an inert atmosphere e.g., N2 or Aratmosphere under ambient pressure. In an alternate method, metalsalts can also be heated in a reducing atmosphere e.g., by passing H2to obtain metal nanoarrays at ambient pressure.DPN techniques were used for controlled deposition of catalysts ofdifferent compositions e.g., NiCo, PdRh, PtRh, Pt, Pd, Fe, Ni, etc. ona flat substrate.

Further, depositing a wide range ofmaterials as nanoscale features onto diverse surfaces is a challengingrequirement for nanoscale processing systems. As a high resolutionscanning probebased directwrite technology, Dip PenNanolithographytm DPNr satisfies and exceeds these fundamentalrequirements. Herein we review recent advances in large area patterningwith twodimensional probe arrays, Active Pentm individually actuatedcantilevers, and microfluidic ink delivery.Relative to other nanopatterning techniques, DPN is a directwritetechnique maintaining high resolution 14 nm line widths, 20 nmpitches, and among sub50 nm techniques, DPN is the only one thatcan directly deposit molecules under ambient conditions. In addition,because NanoInks nanolithography platform  the NSCRIPTORtm  isbased on scanning probe microscopy SPM technology, it is inherentlycapable of both pattern fabrication and immediate verification of theresult by imaging.NanoInks new 2D nano PrintArraystm enable massively parallelnanoscale deposition with 55,000 pens, and point to breakthroughapplications in highthroughput, flexible nanopatterning. DPN isfundamentally a bottom up nanoscale deposition technique i.e.,templated assembly for biological detection or nanotube attachmenthowever, directwrite with etch resist inks leads to a powerful form oftop down nanofabrication i.e., creating nanoscale metallic or solid statestructures. These twodimensional probe arrays are capable ofcovering a square centimeter with nanoscale features at a rate of 107m2 per hour.Further, researchers have demonstrated nanoscale sitespecificplacement of single biomolecules TMV virus, Influenza A, and HIV onMHA templates, maintaining almost 100 bioactivity. In addition tosuggesting novel methods for studying the effectiveness of new drugsand delivery techniques, this technology allows users to routinelypattern libraries of small molecules over very large areas, andrealistically practice single cell experimentation.Conf. 6556 Micro MEMS and Nanotechnologies for Defense and Security176 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655624, Session 5Nanopatterning of metals by scanning probe lithographyJ. D. Batteas, Texas AM Univ.The ability to readily fabricate nanoscale metallic features and contactswould enable numerous applications including molecular electronic andsensing architectures as well as plasmonic devices.  Severalapproaches have been developed in recent years for the patterning ofnanoscale metal structures using variations adaptations of scannedprobe lithography SPL.  In this paper current approaches forfabricating nanoscale metals structures by SPL are outlined along withthe challenges for fabricating such structures by SPL and methods forcontrolling feature growth and fidelity.  Here we will illustrate patterningof metal features using a combination of scanning probe lithographyand electroless metal deposition on surfaces for controlled placementof metal nanostructures on surfaces.655625, Session 5Method of matrix alignment for nanostructurelithographyA. U. Sokolnikov, Visual Solutions and ApplicationsNanoimprint is an emerging lithographic technology that promises highthroughput patterning of nanostructures. Based on the mechanicalembossing principle, nanoprint technology can achieve patternresolutions beyond the limitations set by the light diffraction or beamscattering in other conventional techniques. The difficulty arises with theexact 90 degree setting of the mould above the wafer. Proposed is themethod of achieving this perpendicularity by the means of thecrystallographic properties of Si or GaAs and the matrix made of theabove materials.655626, Session 6How diffusion causes problems for nanotechnology andhow to overcome themP. E. Sheehan, Naval Research Lab.Diffusion plays a crucial role in the creation, operation, anddecomposition of nanometer scale structures.  We will look at tworesearch areas where diffusion dominates device performancesoftnanolithography and nanobiosensors.  Soft nanolithographies such aDip Pen Nanolithography and micro Contact Printing use diffusion totransport material to the substrate and to control feature size.  Bymodeling diffusion in these systems, we can obtain greater control overdeposition and gain insights into improving resolution.  Out of theseinsights evolved a new method for controlling deposition, Thermal DipPen Nanolithography.  By carefully controlling the diffusion of thedeposited ink, this technique can rapidly deposit highlyorderednanostructures with monolayer by monolayer control.  This technique isbeing developed for the rapid prototyping of electronic circuits.Secondly, nanometer scale biosensors have recently been of intenseinterest.  However, the low diffusivity of biomolecules and the newsmaller sensors mean that very little analyte arrives at the sensor.  Weexamine the common situation where both the diffusivity and theconcentration of an analyte are low e.g., unamplified DNA in buffer andshow that for a single nanoscale sensor diffusive flux alone will beinsufficient to make it useful on a reasonable time scale.  Analyticsolutions for several sensor configurations will be presented as well assimulations for more complex situations such as laminar flow.  Finally,different strategies for increasing the flux will be presented along withtheir relative advantages and disadvantages.655627, Session 6Dip pen nanolithography theory and directedassemblybased nanomanufacturing processesS. Hong, Seoul National Univ. South KoreaDippen nanolithography DPN utilizes an atomic force microscope tipas a pen to directly deposit virtually general soft materials onto solidsubstrates to create nanoscale patterns. DPN has been utilized forvarious applications including solid materials patterning, nanoscalebiochip fabrication, etc. However, the basic mechanism of DPN was notfully understood yet. This presentation will discuss how we can modelthe basic and anomalous behaviors of DPN. Furthermore, we willexplain how directedassembly strategy combined with directdeposition methods such as DPN can be utilized as a quick andcheap nanomanufacturing process for nanodevice fabrication.655628, Session 6Investigating the conducting polymer micropatternsensor arrays enerated using intermediatelayerlithographyA. Chakraborty, G. Parthasarathi, C. Luo, Louisiana Tech Univ.Conducting polymers have received much attention since theirdiscovery in 1977. Applications of conducting polymer microsystemsspan from electronic devices to sensors. Traditional sensors had onetoone correspondence between the detector and the target. Multipleconducting polymer micropattern arrays on a common substrate, whenused for sensing, can effectively broaden the scope of a sensor. TheIntermediateLayer lithography ILL technique was developed togenerate multiple conducting polymer micropatterns, of desireddimensions on a common substrate. In this method, the sizes of themicropatterns can be scaled down effectively. Compared to films,micropatterns exhibited higher sensitivity at lower analyteconcentrations. Also, the response of film sensors was not accuratewhen the conducting polymer film was partially covered, indicating thatrare concentrations of analytes would be difficult to detect using theconventional conducting polymer film sensors. In the current work,conducting polymer micropatterns of varying dimensions have beenfabricated using the ILL method and tested for their responses toorganic vapors at low concentrations. The relationship between thesurfacetovolume ratios of the micropatterns and their correspondingsensitivities is found for various target concentrations. The researchresults would provide insights regarding optimization of themicropattern sensors for maximizing their sensitivities.655629, Session 6Generation of conducting polymerbased diodes andcapacitors using intermediatelayer lithographyX. Liu, A. Chakraborty, C. Luo, Louisiana Tech Univ.Conducting polymer based diodes and capacitors have been generatedin this work using an intermediatelayer lithography ILL approachwhich has recently been developed in our group. Compared with Sibased devices, conducting polymer based microelectronic deviceshave distinctive advantages of low weight and good flexibility, and maypotentially replace the corresponding Sibased devices. A challenge ishow to fabricate conducting polymer based microsystems. Mostconducting polymers are sensitive to the environment, and theirelectrical properties tend to deteriorate over time due to overoxidationair, moisture, high temperature and chemical alteration. The currentfabrication techniques i.e., liftoff, dry and wet etching processes usedin lithographic approaches, such as ultraviolet, electronbeam, and xray, involve gases for instance, oxygen and nitrogen, DI water, andorchemical solution such as photoresist and acetone, making themimproper to pattern conducting polymers.Since the ILL method does not involve aggressive chemistry ingeneration of patterns, it has bee employed in this work to fabricateconducting polymer based microdevices, particularly diodes andcapacitors. In fabrication of the devices, multiple layers of metals e.g.,Al and polymers e.g., PPy and PEDOT are coated in a PMMA sheetfollowed by the patterning through the insertion of Si molds. Thedetailed fabrication procedure and test results will be given in the paper.Conf. 6556 Micro MEMS and Nanotechnologies for Defense and Security spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 177655630, Session 6Using dip pen nanolithography and nanografting as toolsfor directing the assembly of macromolecular scaffoldsJ. J. De Yoreo, S. Chung, Lawrence Livermore National Lab. B. C.L. Cheung, Univ. of NebraskaLincoln J. E. Johnson, ScrippsResearch InstituteBoth dippen nanolithography and nanografting can be used tochemically pattern surfaces at length scales commensurate with thedimensions of many viruses.  The latter have recently gained attentionamongst materials scientists because they can be sitespecificallymodified to present catalytic, electronic, and optically active moieties orbind to semiconductor and metal nanoparticles.  Thus they can serveas building blocks for fabricating hierarchical structures with nearmolecular density of functionality, provided their assembly can bedirected.  Here we report results using scanned probe nanolithographySPN to create chemical templates that direct organization of viruses atsurfaces.As model systems, we have chosen nearspherical Cowpea MosaicVirus CPMV, wirelike M13 bacteriophage, and diskshaped capsids ofTobacco Mosaic Virus TMV.  These have been modified to bindspecifically to selfassembled monolayers SAMs deposited by SPN.For example,  CPMV was engineered to present either cysteine Cys orhistidine His tags at the capsid apices in order to bind them to alkylthiol SAMs terminated by maleimide MA or nickelchelatingnitrilotriacetic acid NiNTA respectively and deposited on atomicallyflat gold substrates.  Template features had sizes ranging from 10100nm.  AFM was used to investigate the degree of ordering, packinggeometry, assembly kinetics, and clustersize distribution.We show that the assembly morphology depends on all parameterschosen surface chemistry mobility, virus concentration flux, andsolution PEG concentration interviral potential.  In the case of CPMV,as the virusvirus attraction is increased through introduction ofhydrophobic effects, 2D arrays of viruses evolve from poorlyordered, towellordered rhombohedral, and then hexagonally close packedassemblies and 1D patterns increase from single to multiple rows ofviruses in width.  Taking cues from previous work on both epitaxial andcolloidal systems, we present a physical picture of virus assembly attemplates which combines the nucleation kinetics of epitaxial systemswith the thermodynamics of colloidal condensation.655631, Session 7Tierscalable reconnaissance the challenge of sensoroptimization, sensor deployment, sensor fusion, andsensor interoperabilityW. Fink, California Institute of TechnologyRobotic reconnaissance operations are called for in extremeenvironments such as space, including planetary atmospheres,surfaces, and subsurfaces, as well as in potentially hazardous orinaccessible operational areas on Earth such as mine fields, enemyoccupied territories, terrorist infiltrated environments, or areas that havebeen exposed to biochemical agents or radiation. Real timereconnaissance enables identification and characterization of transientevents. A fundamentally new mission concept for tierscalablereconnaissance of operational areas recently has been devised Fink etal., Planetary and Space Science, 53, 14191426, 2005 see also httpautonomy.caltech.eduautonomytierscalable.html that is aimed atreplacing engineering and safety constrained mission designs of thepast. The tierscalable paradigm integrates multitier orbit atmosphere  surfacesubsurface and multiagent satellites UAVsblimps  ground agentssensors hierarchical missionarchitectures, not only introducing mission redundancy and safety, butenabling and optimizing intelligent, unconstrained, and distributedreconnaissance in real time. To support such mission architectures, ahigh degree of operation autonomy is required. Essential requirementsof such operation autonomy are 1 automatic mapping of anoperational area from different vantage points including vehicle healthmonitoring 2 automatic feature extraction and targetregionofinterest identification within the mapped operational area e.g., Fink, etal., Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Vol. 69, Number 10S, A535,2005 and 3 automatic target prioritization for closeup examinatione.g., Fink, Proceedings IEEE WCCI 2006, Vancouver, Canada, 1111611119. These requirements imply the optimal deployment of sensorssensor platforms, sensor fusion, and sensor interoperability. Moreover,the design and performance of the individual MEMS sensor mayshould be subject to an evolutionary optimization process both beforeand during a mission. The Visual and Autonomous Exploration SystemsResearch Laboratory at Caltech httpautonomy.caltech.edu isconducting RD in all of the above aspects of tierscalablereconnaissance.655632, Session 7Fractal analysis of proteins involved in drug design onbiosensor surfacesA. Sadana, The Univ. of MississippiA fractal analysis of the binding and dissociation of the naturalcyclotide, kalata B1 and its analogue, kalata B6 in solution to DMPEdimyristoylLalphaphosphatidylethanolamine liposome immobilizedon a L1 sensor chip Kamimori et al., 2005 is presented.  Cylcotidesexhibit a broad range of biological activities that include antimicrobial,cytotoxic, and antiHIV activities.  A better understanding of the bindingand dissociation reactions on membrane surfaces would lead to betterphysical insights into these types of reactions.  The fractal analysis isused with this purpose in mind to relate the binding and dissociationrate coefficients with the degree of heterogeneity or fractal dimensionpresent on the DMPE liposome immobilized on the L1 sensor chipsurface.The fractal dimension provides a quantitative indication of the state ofdisorder fractal dimension on the sensor chip surface, and is related tothe binding and the dissociaton rate coefficients present on the sensorchip surface.  In general, an increase in the fractal dimension or thedegree of heterogeneity on the sensor chip surface leads to an increasein the binding and in the dissociation rate coefficeint value.655633, Session 7Miniaturized selfadaptive tuning of MEMS gyroscope forspaceD. Keymeulen, Jet Propulsion Lab.We propose a tuning method for MicroElectroMechanical SystemsMEMS gyroscopes based on evolutionary computation that has thecapacity to efficiently increase the sensitivity of MEMS gyroscopesthrough tuning and, furthermore, to find the optimally tunedconfiguration for this state of increased sensitivity. We present theresults of an experiment to determine the speed and efficiency of anevolutionary algorithm applied to electrostatic tuning of MEMS microgyros.  The MEMS gyro used in this experiment is a pyrex postresonator gyro PRG in a closedloop control system.  A measure of thequality of tuning is given by the difference in resonant frequencies, orfrequency split, for the two orthogonal rocking axes.  The currentimplementation of the closedloop platform is able to measure andattain a relative stability in the submillihertz range, leading to areduction of the frequency split to less than 100 mHz655634, Session 7Advanced signal processing for enabling next generationMEMSNEMS sensorsT. George, ViaLogy Corp.The application of advanced signal processing algorithms has largelybeen neglected by the Micro and Nano sensor developmentcommunity, and yet this is the single most important area for improvingthe performance of these sensors.  In the last two decades, stochasticresonance techniques have emerged as a novel, and counterintuitiveapproach toward improving sensor performance.  With this approach,named Active Signal Processing, instead of removing system noise, it ispossible to improve signaltonoise ratio SNR by injecting noise intothe measurement.  ViaLogy Corp. has pioneered the development anddemonstration of Quantum Resonance Interferometry QRI, a quantumConf. 6556 Micro MEMS and Nanotechnologies for Defense and Security178 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssstochastic resonance QSRbased technique for improving SNR. Thecore of QRI processing involves the QSRbased generation of aQuantum Expressor Function QEF, which characterizes the system ofinterest by encoding within it the noise environment, minimum level ofdetection, and the precision of measurement. Using digital postprocessing of sensor information, QRI can determine the presence of asignal by the destruction of the resonance condition responsible forgenerating the system QEF. For applications aimed at detecting thepresence of a signal, the strength of the signal is proportional to thenumber of iterations of the algorithm required for destruction of theresonance the fewer the iterations, the stronger the signal. For MEMSNEMS sensing applications, we envisage exploiting the ability of theQEF to provide highresolution characterization of the sensors noiseenvironment amplitudes and frequencies.  The application of QRIprocessing to detect weakly expressing genes in DNA microarray chipswill be presented.655635, Session 7Reliability shortcomings for micronano technologybased systemsE. J. Garcia, M. A. Polosky, Sandia National Labs.Micro Nano TechnologyBased Systems MNTBased Systems areexpected to provide unprecedented capabilities for aerospaceapplications.  However we have not sufficiently addressed the reliabilityof such systems for a number of reasons.  For example, ourfoundational understanding of such systems is incomplete at the basicphysics level and our understanding of how individual subsystemsinteract is much less than we originally assumed.  In addition themanner in which we operate during the product realization cycle haslarge implications for the ultimate reliability we can expect to achieve.Currently it is quite difficult to determine the reliability of MNTBasedSystems and is in fact borne out by a number of estimates we haveseen that are unsatisfactory.  We shall discuss a number of issues thatat present have slowed our progress in developing NMTBasedSystems and have deterred us from effectively ascertaining the truereliability of such systems.655636, Session 8GaNbased microchemical sensor nodesK. Son, B. Yang, Jet Propulsion Lab. N. Prokopuk, Naval AirWarfare Ctr. J. S. Moon, HRL Labs., LLC M. Gallegos, JetPropulsion Lab. J. Yang, A. M. Khan, Univ. of South CarolinaWe are developing GaNbased micro chemical sensor nodes consistingof GaN HEMT High Electron Mobility Transistor sensors integrated withRF communication links, which will enable autonomous realtimeremote detection and monitoring of chemical agents in large areasunder all weather conditions. The GaN HEMT has a two dimensionalelectron gas 2DEG conducting channel at the AlGaNGaN interfacenear 30nm the surface. The 2DEG is highly responsive to surfacepolarization interactions such as those induced by chemicaladsorbates. This high sensitivity provides a detection mechanism forchemical analytes without the need for elaborate surface preparation.For selectivity, we use a novel sensing mechanism based on gateelectrodespecific, temperaturedependent desorption spectroscopy,which facilitates fingerprinting of chemical agents. As a solid statechemical sensor, the GaN HEMTs can be massproduced with a lowmass and small volume design.  The low dissipation power and shortresponse times of the GaN sensors are ideally suited for chemicaldetection technologies. In this paper, we present our study on electricalresponses of GaN HEMT sensors to chemical agent simulants andother common chemicals and discuss a batterypowered highly efficientdata transmission scheme for GaNbased sensor nodes for multiagentdetection. For chemical agent identification based on gate electrodespecific, desorption temperature profile, we present the responses of aGaN sensor array fabricated with Ni, Pt, and Pd gate electrodesmeasured in a range of 25 400C using a microheater integrated withthe sensor.This work has been supported by DTRA through ARO and managed byDr. Stephen J.

Fuchs, U.S. Army Armament Research, Development andEngineering Ctr.The development of microthrusters for satellite control has been an ongoing endeavor since the middle 1990s.  Microthrusters are also criticalfor the development of terrestrial micromissiles and nano air vehicles tobe used for reconnaissance, surveillance, and sensor emplacement.With the maturation of MEMS manufacturing methods, the ability toproduce the physical components of the thrusters can now be readilyfabricated.The thruster type that is the most straightforward to explore anddevelop is the combustion of a chemical propellant.  The propellant isignited by a heating element to give a single shot thrust.  UtilizingMEMS manufacturing technology, a bank of thrusters can be ganged,with each individual chamber loaded with propellant to give multiplefirings.  The basic model for such a system is a solid rocket motor.  Thedesired elements for the propellant of a chemical thruster are highspecific impulse Isp, high temperature and pressure, and lowmolecular weight combustion gases.  Since the combustion chamber ofa microthruster is extremely small, the propellant material must be ableto ignite, sustain and complete its burn inside the chamber.  Thepropellant can be either a solid or a liquid.There are a large number of energetic materials available as candidatesfor a propellant for microthrusters.  There has been no systematicevaluation of the available energetic materials as propellant candidatesfor microthrusters.  This report summarizes computations done on aseries of energetic materials to address their suitabilities asmicrothruster propellants.655642, Session 9Micromechanical sensorsT. G. Thundat, Oak Ridge National Lab.Molecular adsorption on a cantilever surface results in cantileverbending due to an adsorptioninduced differential surface stress. Theadsorptioninduced deflection of a cantilever beam reflects the interplaybetween strain energy increase of the beam and the free energyreduction of a reaction. Since free energy reduction is common for allreactions, the cantilever array forms a universal platform for labelfreedetection of various reactions. Microfabrication of inexpensivecantilever arrays offers an unprecedented opportunity in thedevelopment of miniature sensors for multiplexed detection chemicaland biological analytes. Chemical selectivity is achieved by usingreceptor based surface modification. Since receptorbased detectiondoes not offer high selectivity, a receptor free technique for molecularrecognition can be developed using the extreme high temperaturesensitivity of a bimaterial cantilever.  A bimaterial cantilever withadsorbed molecules undergoes bending when exposed to mid infraredIR waves when the molecules adsorb the IR light.  Differential bendingof the cantilever as a function of illuminating IR wavelength resemblesan IR absorption spectrum of the adsorbed molecules.  We haveobtained sensitivity in the sub nanogram level for explosives, andbiowarfare agents. The sensitivity could be further improved byoptimizing the cantilever properties. This talk will focus on both thescientific understanding as well as the technological progress in thedevelopment of cantileverbased analysis of chemical and biomolecularreactions.655643, Session 9Optical microresonator sensor based on conjugatedmolecules for trace explosive detectionA. Chen, A. Pyayt, L. Dalton, A. Jen, J. Luo, Univ. of WashingtonConjugated chromophores have electron rich groups donor andelectron deficiency groups acceptors connected by a bridge. Thecharge distribution of conjugated molecular systems is sensitive to thelocal environment of the molecules. The change in the chargedistribution will cause the polarizability index of refraction,hyperpolarizability nonlinear optical effects, and band structure opticalabsorption to change. It is know that the optical properties such asabsorption spectrum, index of refraction, and fluorescence life timechanges dramatically when these molecules are exposed to solvents ofdifferent degree of polarity, external electrical field, and intermolecularelectrostatic interaction. High explosive chemicals are known to behighly electronegative. It has been demonstrated that conjugatedpolymers respond to a quantity of vapor as small as about 1018 mol100,000 molecules of TNT and are sensitive enough to detect the odorof TNT and DNT in the air over a buried landmine  an estimated subpartsperquadrillion 1015 concentration.Compared with fluorescence detection, for which the excitation andfluorescence lights are typically outside the low loss window of the fiberand the collection of the fluorescence light is hard to be efficient, thechange in the index of refraction and absorption are more suited forfiber optic sensors.  Several approaches can be used to incorporatethese organic sensor molecules in fiber optical sensors. The sensormolecules can be doped in the plastic optical fiber to make a sensorfiber that can serve as a distributed sensor to monitor a large area. Thesensor polymers can also be used to make optical resonators that arecouple to optical fiber for remote chemical sensing. With apolycarbonate doped with a conjugated electron donoracceptormolecule, index change in vapor of 100 ppb DNT a stimulant to TNTas large as 103 as observed. Taking the advantage of such largeindex change, the micro ring resonators made with this material haveshown large resonance shift on the order of nm.655644, Session 9Molecular detection in metal nanocavitiesS.

Zhao, S. Shanmukh, Y. J. Liu, L. P. Jones, R. A. Dluhy, R. A. Tripp,The Univ. of GeorgiaTo produce a high enhancement and reproducible SERS substrate isone of the key challenges for practical applications of SERS. Wedemonstrate that the aligned silver nanorod array substrates preparedby the oblique angle deposition method are capable of providingextremely high enhancement factors 108 at nearinfraredwavelengths 785 nm for a standard reporter molecule 1,2 transbispyridylethene BPE. The enhancement factor depends strongly onthe length of the Ag nanorods, the substrate coating, the polarization ofthe excitation light, as well as the incident angle. With the currentoptimum structure, we demonstrate that the detection limit for BPE canbe lower than 1016 moles. With these Ag nanorod array substrates, wealso demonstrated that SERS can distinguish between trace amount ofviruses such as respiratory syncytial virus RSV, rhinovirus, adenovirus,human immunodeficiency virus HIV, and influenza flu virus.  Theminor spectral differences within strains of single virus type such asRSV virus, can also be detected, suggesting that this technology can beapplied to detect genetically modified viruses that may be agents ofbioterrorism. The detection of virus presented in infected cells has alsobeen demonstrated.

It was experimentallyfound that for the bending mode the diaphragm in liquid exhibits thesame Q value as the diaphragm in air, while for the thickness mode thediaphragm in liquid exhibits a much smaller Q value.

A. Deshusses, S. Mubeen, T. Zhang, N. V. Myung, Univ. ofCaliforniaRiversideOnedimensional nanostructures based chemical sensors have recentlyattracted a great deal of attention because of their superior sensingperformance due to their high surface area to volume ratio and uniquephysical and electrical properties. We have developed several simplefabrication techniques to synthesize microgas sensors usingelectrochemically functionalized singlewalled carbon nanotubesSWNTs with either metal nanoparticles, metal oxide nanoparticles, orconducting polymer nanodeposits. The method allows creation of highdensity individually addressable nanosensor arrays. For examples, Pdnanoparticles were electrodeposited on SWNT networks to create ahydrogen gas sensor and conducting polymers were deposited forammonia, NOx and volatile organic compound sensing. By varyingnanofabrication conditions, the sensing performance could be tuned.

Systematic investigations of the effects of selectedparameters on the sensor characteristics allowed to develop a betterfundamental understanding of the sensors. Recent results includingfabrication methods, sensing mechanisms, and sensing performance willbe presented at the conference, and future applications in defense andhomeland security will be discussed.655650, Session 10Review of an intermediatelayer lithography approachC. Luo, Louisiana Tech Univ.Conducting polymers, because of their promising potential to replacesilicon and metals in building devices, have attracted great attentionsince the discovery of high conductivity in doped polyacetylene in 1977.Lithographic techniques present significant technical challenges whenworking with conducting polymers. Sensitivity of conducting polymers toenvironmental conditions e.g., air, oxygen, moisture, high temperatureand chemical solutions makes current photolithographic methodsunsuitable for patterning the conducting polymers due to theinvolvement of wet andor dry etching processes in those methods.Existing nonphotolithographic approaches have limitations inthroughput, resolution or electrical insulation. Therefore, an intermediatelayer lithography ILL approach has been recently developed in mygroup to produce conducting polymer micronanostructures. In the ILLapproach, an intermediate layer of an electrically insulating polymer iscoated between the substrate and a layer of the conducting polymer tobe printed. Subsequently, the conducting polymer is printed through amold insertion using a hotembossing process. The current hotembossing based methods face the obstacles of residual layer anddepth of field i.e., the height variation in the mold structures. In contrast,the ILL approach does not have a residual layer in the material of interest,making conducting polymer patterns isolated from one another andavoiding the shortcutting problem in the electrical applications of thesepatterns. Furthermore, in the ILL, the height variation potentially existingamong the mold structures has been transferred to the intermediatelayer, ensuring that all patterns in the mold have been properlytransferred to the conducting polymer layer. In addition to conductingpolymers, the ILL approach can also be applied to pattern metals as wellas other types of polymers. In this talk, I will give a review of this ILLmethod and the corresponding results that we have achieved to date655651, Session 10Nucleic acid engineering using DNA as a generic insteadof genetic materalD. Luo, Cornell Univ.Our research focuses on molecular engineering DNA as a generic insteadof a genetic material. By taking advantages of the amazing chemical,physical, and biological properties of DNA and by utilizing a myriad ofDNA manipulating enzymes, we have employed DNA as a true polymer.However, unlike chemical polymers which have linear, branched,networked, and dendritic structures, almost all DNA has only linear orcircular architectures. To realistically use DNA as a polymeric material,we have created branched, networked, and dendritic DNA as additionalmaterial building blocks some of them were inspired by pioneering workof Seeman and his group. These DNA materials are water soluble,biocompatible, biodegradable and most importantly monodisperse andanisotropic and have provided us with an enlarged tool box of designerhybrid materials for complex nanoarchitectures as well as novelfunctionalities. In essence we have created DNAbased tinkertoys forconstruction of new materials. A few examples of nucleic acidengineered materials will be discussed in this talk they include DNAdendrimers, DNA nanobuckyballs, DNAbased nanobarcode systems,DNA hydrogels, DNA liposomes, DNAAu nanoparticles, and in particular,a cellfree, protein producing DNA hydrogel. These examples not onlyillustrate the concept that DNA can be utilized as a generic, designermaterial but also demonstrate the power of nucleic acid engineeredmaterials as a link between biology and polymer chemistry, as well asbetween DNA and materials sciences and engineering. New propertiesand applications are expected from nucleic acid engineered materials.655652, Poster SessionHighperformance sensing platform based on surfaceplasmoncoupled fluorescenceS.

ICxNomadics has been developing and exploiting innovative fluorescentmaterials to detect chemical signatures of interest in defense, homelandsecurity, environmental, and industrial applications.  Efforts to continueimproving the sensing performance of these reporter materials haveconcentrated on enhancements in the effective collection of analyteresponse emissions while rejecting ambient and excitation light andbackground emissions.  Recent advances in surface plasmoncoupledemission SPCE techniques have shown that this technique cansignificantly improve the performance of a fluorescencebased sensorsystem because of their ability to focus reporter emissions into specificdistributions. By taking advantage of such designed distributions, thesignaltonoise ratio of the fluorescence signal can be drasticallyimproved.  We have successfully combined these unique characteristicsof SPCE with our sampling mechanism and fluorescent reporters todemonstrate the potential of this new fluorescence platform for thedetection of various chemicals, including toxic analytes.655653, Poster SessionMagnetostrictive nanoparticle as a novel biosensorplatformS.

Hong Kong ChinaIt is of interest to the optoelectronic community if indextunablephotonic crystals can be realized by using ferroelectric materials sincethe refractive index of the ferroelectric materials can be electricallytuned through the electrooptic effect. In this work, we present ourstudy on developing a tunable onedimensional 1D photonic crystalPC based on Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 and MgO multilayer structure. Photonicbandgaps of the photonic crystals with different ratio ofBa0.7Sr0.3TiO3MgO were numerically demonstrated using thePlanewave Expansion PWE method. It is found that 1 change inrefractive index of Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 results in a 0.87  frequency shift inband gap of the photonic crystal, which corresponds to a wavelengthshift of 5 nm and 12 nm at wavelength of 632.8nm and 1550nm,respectively.

L. Jim, D. Wang, C. W. Leung, C. L. Choy, L. W. H. Chan Wong,The Hong Kong Polytechnic Univ. Hong Kong ChinaTunable photonic crystals PCs have attracted much attention in thepast decade, for their various applications such as ultrafast opticalfilters and optical waveguides with adddrop functionalities. A commonmeans of tuning PC is by changing the refractive indices of theconstituent materials via the linear or quadratic electrooptic effect,which leads to a shift of the bandgap positions of the PC. The leadfreeceramic barium strontium titanate BST has a high quadratic electrooptic coefficient comparable to lanthanummodified lead zirconatetitanate PLZT, and is a promising candidate for leadfree tunable PCs.Here we present a study on the feasibility of developing onedimensional tunable PC, using BST and magnesium oxide MgOmultilayer structures. The bandgap diagram of the PC structure iscalculated using the Planewave Expansion PWE method.  For a 1change in the refractive index of BST, a 0.87 frequency shift in thebandgap can be achieved. It corresponds to a wavelengthshift of 5 nmand 12 nm for wavelength of 632.8nm and 1550nm, respectively.  Thetransmission property of the PC is further verified by the FiniteDifference Time Domain FDTD simulation.655656, Poster SessionGeneration of silicon nanowires using a new thinning andtrimming methodH. Wang, H. Li, A. Chakraborty, X. Liu, C. Luo, Louisiana Tech Univ.A new thinning and trimming approach has been explored to producesilicon nanowires SiNW from silicon microwires. Onedimensionalnanostructures have attracted great attention recently because of theirpotential applications as excellent components in micronanodevices.SiNWs in particular have received much attention since silicon is themost widely used material in integratedcircuit and microfabricationprocesses and has unique mechanical and electrical properties.However, due to the shortcomings of the existing fabricationapproaches, new methods are needed to produce SiNWs that can notonly be massively fabricated but also batch integrated to functionaldevices. The developed thinning and trimming approach is believed tobe such a method, and would permit precise control of the structure,size and positions of SiNWs. Furthermore, this method may be used tobreak through the limitation of lithography in the sense that siliconfeatures fabricated by any lithographic methods can be furtherminiaturized using the approach. Our progress on developing this newthinning and trimming approach will be detailed in the paper.655657, Poster SessionFabrication of silicon nanobridgebased sensorH. Li, A. Chakraborty, X. Liu, C. Luo, Louisiana Tech Univ.Microsensors have been widely used in various applications, includingseismic, temperature, light, sound, magnetic, chemical, etc. the currenttrend is towards reducing the dimension further to nano scale, thusincreasing their sensitivity and adaptability. The mechanisms for thesesensors are different but one common obstacle exists how to reducethe dimension of the components to nano scale without compromisingtheir mechanical stability. To overcome this challenge, we develop anew method to fabricate silicon nanostructures, and employ them assensors. We also establish theoretical models for the sensing purposeand compare them with experimental results.

H. Yoon, J. Park, D. Shen, D. Kim, Auburn Univ.Piezoelectric films such as ZnO and PZT have been considered as apotential material for sensor and actuator applications, due to highpiezoelectric and electromechanical coefficients. For acoustic wavedevice applications, the ability to control film structure is required forachieving high piezoelectric activity which determines deviceperformance. Fabrication of ZnO films has been performed by RFmagnetron sputtering, and PZT films by chemical solution process. Thefilm structure has been controlled by modifying process parameters.Various characterizations such as XRD, SEM, AFM, and Ramanspectroscopy have been performed to examine the structural propertiesof films. With the ability to modulate film structure which eventuallydetermines the device performance, the arrays of flexural plate wavedevice have been successfully fabricated onto 4inch Si wafer, and therelationship between the film microstructure and the electroacousticproperty of the device will be discussed in terms of device performancefor the biosensor applications.655660, Poster SessionPiezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers withrectangular diaphragms for binary frequency ultrasonicapplicationsC. Chao, The Hong Kong Polytechnic Univ. Hong Kong ChinaPiezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer pMUT consists of apiezoelectric capacitor built on a micromachined silicon membrane, andexploits its flexural vibration mode for ultrasound transmitting andsensing. It is typically operating at the fundamental frequency wheremaximum sensitivity can be achieved, and is insensitive at higher orderof resonances because the harmonic signals generated from differentparts of the diaphragm tend to cancel with each other. This leads to avery narrow bandwidth. In this paper, rectangularshaped pMUTs fordualfrequency reception are proposed and fabricated by usingpiezoelectric PVDFTrFE copolymer coating and siliconmicromachining technologies. The electrode patterns are properlydesigned to efficiently make use of both 0, 0 and 0, 2 vibration modesof the rectangular membrane. By adjusting the length and width of thediaphragm, the ratio of the two frequencies can be variable on demandwithin a wide range. The micromachined dualfrequency sensors will beuseful for miniaturized ultrasonic systems operating on binary frequencyshiftkeyed BFSK principles, such as precise distance detectors andultrasonic localarea communication terminals.Conf. 6556 Micro MEMS and Nanotechnologies for Defense and Security spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 183Conf. 6557 Head and HelmetMounted Displays XII Design and ApplicationsMondayFriday 913 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6557 Head and HelmetMounted Displays XII Design andApplications655701, Session 1All solidstate electrochromic device for helmet mounteddisplaysH. Demiryont, K. C. Shannon III, J. C. Isidorsson, Eclipse EnergySystems, Inc.HelmetMounted Displays HMDs do not allow the pilot to raise orlower a tinted visor when moving from a high to low light level condition.A variable transmittance system is a possible solution.  The EclipseVariable Electrochromic Devices ECD is well suited for these lightmodulation applications. The ECDs modulates light intensity bychanging transmission level under an applied electric field approx1.5V. The optical density of the ECD may be continuously varied over atransmission range by varying the applied voltage. This process isreversed by changing the polarity of the applied electric field.An allsolidstate ECD, the Eclipse ECD is comprised of a transparentbottom electrodeactive elementtransparent top electrode structurewhich incorporates an all solid state electrolyte, a low resistance Eclipseproprietary electrode and is an all insitu vacuum deposited system.The solidstate electrolyte eliminates possible complications associatedwith gelbased technologies for lens applications, the needs forlamination and any additional visor modification.  The low temperaturedeposition process enables direct application of the technology ontoHMD flight visors. The average modulation of the system is from 48 to18 modulation in 3 seconds while bleaching clearing and 10seconds when coloring darkening. In addition the coating is easilymanufactured, trimable, has near spectral neutrality and fails in the clearbleached condition.The paper includes an overview of the performance characteristics ofthe Eclipse ECD technology, performance results from trimabilityexperiments, and technical progress specific to its application in HMDsand curved surfaces.655702, Session 1Evolution of electrochromic materials for visionbasedapplicationsR.

A. Fellowes, M. V. Wood, U.S. Army Night Vision  ElectronicSensors Directorate O. Prache, eMagin Corp.eMagin Corporation has recently developed longlife OLEDXLmaterials for use in their AMOLED microdisplays for headwornapplications.  AMOLED displays have been known to exhibit high levelsof performance with regards to contrast, time response, uniformity, andviewing angle, but a lifetime improvement has been perceived to beessential for broadening the applications of OLEDs in the military and inthe commercial market.

The primary head tracker technologies commercially availableare magnetic trackers, inertial trackers, and optical trackers.  And eachhead tracker has its own method of determining the pilots headposition within the cockpit of the aircraft.Magnetic trackers generally have a small head mounted size andminimal head weight.  Since they sense a generated Magnetic field,their accuracy can be affected by other magnetic fields or ferrous184 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsscomponents within the cockpit.  Inertial trackers cover the entire headmotion box but require constant motion in order to accommodate driftingof the inertial sensors or a secondary system that updates the inertialsystem, often referred to as a hybrid system. Finally, optical headtrackers OHT are immune to magnetic fields.  Some of their limitationsmay be daylightnight vision goggle NVG compatibility issues and,depending on system configuration, may require numerous emitters andor receivers to cover a large head motion box and provide a wide field ofregard.The Dynamic Tracker Test Apparatus DTTA was designed by the HelmetMounted Sensory Technology HMST laboratory to accurately measureazimuth rotation in both static and dynamic conditions for the purpose ofdetermining the accuracy of a variety of head trackers.  Before the DTTAcould be used as an evaluation tool, it required characterization todetermine the amount and location of any induced pitch or roll as thetable rotated in azimuth.

H. Harding, C. E. Rash, J. S. Martin, U.S. Army AeromedicalResearch Lab.As the military increases its reliance upon and continues to developHelmet Mounted Displays HMD, it is paramount that HMDs aredeveloped that meet the operational needs of the warfighter.   In seethrough HMDs, symbology is overlaid or added to the seethroughbackground.  For the symbology to be seen and understood, it musthave sufficient contrast to standout from the background and beclearly recognized.  In an earlier paper, Harding et al. 2005 showedthat the quality of seethrough symbology was greatly influenced by thecomplexity of natural backgrounds.  Complexity was characterized bythe standard deviation of small patches patches subtending about1.5o.    Characterizing the complexity of natural backgrounds bymeasuring their standard deviation may not be adequate.  For example,in the figure below, two grayscale images are shown with each imagehaving about the same standard deviation and about the same averagecontrast textbackground. Overlaid text can clearly be seen in theimage on the left but is difficult to decipher any characters on the imageon the right. The two images differ in their spatial frequency content.The gradient background is characterized by low spatial frequencies,whereas the random background is characterized by high spatialfrequencies.   Predicting the legibility of symbology in a seethroughHMD requires additional terms that characterize the local contrastwithin a background.Figure.

However, space is alsolimited on a HMD and any symbology that is presented takes upvaluable space and can occlude a pilots vision. There has been muchresearch area of visual cueing and visual search as they relate to seekingout visual targets in the sky. However, the idea of localized auditorycueing, as it could apply in the realm of airtoair targeting, is an arealess studied. One question is how can we present information such thata pilots attention will be directed to the object of interest the mostquickly Some different types of target location cueing symbology havebeen studied to find such aspects of symbology that will aid a pilot mostin acquiring a target. The purpose of this study is to determine the bestmethod of cueing a person to visual targets in the shortest amount oftime possible using auditory and visual cues in combination. Specifically,participants were presented with different combinations of reflected linecues, standard line cues, and localized auditory cues for primary andsecondary targets. The cues were presented using an HMD and 3Dauditory headphones, with a magnetic head tracker used to determinewhen the participant had visually acquired the targets. The possiblebenefits of these cues based on the times to acquire are discussed.655713, Session 3Effects of simple HMD operations on primary visual tasksJ. McIntire, P. R. Havig, G. A. Reis, Air Force Research Lab.Previously Havig, McIntire and Swinney 2006 reported a study in whichnot only the placement but also the task to be performed on a headmounted display HMD had an effect on the users ability to perform anoutside task i.e., on a large screen placed in front of them. Theyconcluded that certain tasks on an HMD may not lead to optimalperformance on outside tasks. However, there may be times when anHMD can be used for a task that does interfere. The purpose of thepresent set of experiments was to determine what types of tasks may beconducted on an HMD that may either 1 not hinder performance on anoutside tasks andor 2 actually improve performance on an outsidetask. We conducted two studies to investigate both of these situationsusing a similar visual search task to the one we used previously as ouroutside task. In one study the HMD task was similar to a monitoring taskin which the observer only needed to respond to the HMD task when acertain event occurred. In the other study, the HMD task was designedto help with the visual search task. We also replicated these tasks usinga desktop monitor in place of the HMD to simulate the situation found inmodern air operation centers. We discuss these results in terms of tasksthat may be at least innocuous if not beneficial to use on a secondarydisplay.655714, Session 3Helmetmounted sensoroffset evaluation using manualand locomotion tasksJ. E. Melzer, Rockwell Collins Optronics K. Moffitt, ConsultantThe advent of small, electronic sensors, displays and fusion processors,provides the opportunity to mount these assemblies on an infantryhelmet, thus providing the soldier the ability to see, navigate and fight ina variety of lighting conditions. The nature of the sensors allows thedesigner to position them in one of several positions on the helmet toimprove head and neck loading. The question is what impact this has onthe perception of the real world by the soldier.A monocular helmetmounted display with three different camerapositions was developed for a preliminary evaluation of sensoroffseteffects. This system was used to measure performance and workload fora manual cardsorting task and for a walking obstaclecourse task. Thispaper will summarize the results of these experiments.655715, Session 3Optimizing multispectral sensors through enhancedimagery for the warfighterS. Dixon, P. L. Marasco, Air Force Research Lab.Todays fighter pilot has a multitude of sophisticated displays providingdiverse information and imagery. These displays provide critical targetinginformation enabling anytimeanywhere strike capability.  A drawbackhowever is the potential for task saturation from having to process visualinformation while navigating the aircraft through dangerous aerialConf. 6557 Head and HelmetMounted Displays XII Design and Applications186 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsscombat environments.  Numerous computer algorithms already exist toprocess these images to improve display information resolution.  Imageenhancement helps reduce the workload by processing and refiningimages thereby providing faster, more precise information for the pilot.  Inorder for image enhancement to be effective, the relevant environmentalfeatures need to be determined. This paper addresses a study examiningthe salient battlespace image features in need of enhancement fordelivery of operationally relevant visual information. Through literaturesearches and pilot interviews, imagery requirements for land and airfeatures were determined. This information was utilized to create a seriesof degraded battlespace images .  This imagery was then enhancedusing computerbased algorithms. A Human Factors evaluation wasperformed to determine if there was a significant improvement in targetdetection for the enhanced imagery when compared to the baselineinformation.  The results from this study provide guidelines forprogramming efficient image processing algorithms useful for current andfuture multispectral imaging systems.655716, Session 4A limited flight study for investigating hyperstereo visionC. E. Rash, M. E. Kalich, W. E. McLean, U.S. Army AeromedicalResearch Lab.A novel helmetmounted display HMD design that attempts to reduceheadsupported weight and centerofmass CM offset while offering theexpanded capability of integrating image intensification I2 and forwardlooking infrared FLIR thermal imagery relocates the I2 tubes on thesides of the helmet. This approach introduces a visual phenomenonreferred to as hyperstereo vision.  This phenomenon manifests itselfprimarily as exaggerated depth perception, causing objects in the nearfield of vision to appear closer than they actually are.A limited flight study was conducted to identify areas of concern for U.S.Army rotarywing aviators having to perform standard flight maneuversusing an HMD design that introduces the hyperstereo condition. FiveArmy aviators flew a hyperstereo HMD with a safety pilot on the controlsin a UH60 helicopter two pilots accumulated a total of eight flights eachand three pilots flew only onehour orientation flights. Pilots completedboth in and postflight questionnaires requested pilot comparison onoperational and performance capabilities as compared to previous flightexperience with I2based night vision goggles NVGs.It was concluded that above approximately 100 ft 30 m, thehyperstereo HMD design can be successfully utilized in the flight tasksrequired at such altitudes.  However, for flight operations involving a highpercentage of lowlevel navigation flight, landings, and takeoffs indemanding environments, the visual impact of hyperstereo on depthperception and distance estimation introduces moderate to potentiallyhigh levels of perceptual problems.  The foremost perceptual problem isthat the ground and near objects appear closer than they really are.Pilots reported difficulties with hovering, takeoffs, and landings,especially rollon landings and landings on sloping terrain.  Crosscockpitscanning was reported as uncomfortable since many objects and the copilot were doubled and semitransparent.Data seem to support claims that a moderate level of flight training 58hours permit pilots to develop compensation techniques that allowadequate and safe performance on the majority of flight tasks performedin this study, but with the trepidation and caution associated with a newlearning experience.  The one exception was landing on terrain slopes,which was considered by the subject pilots to not having been masteredin the 8hour flight exposure.  Study subjects estimate approximately 10hours of flight experience would be needed to reach proficiency with themaneuvers performed.655717, Session 4Hyperstereopsis in helmet mounted NVDs SlopeperceptionG. W. Stuart, Defence Science and Technology OrganisationAustralia P. R. Flanagan, Deakin Univ. Australia P. Gibbs, DefenceScience and Technology Organisation AustraliaSome night vision systems have sensors mounted on the sides of thehelmet with visual output projected onto a display in front of theoperators eyes. This arrangement produces a situation ofhyperstereopsis in which binocular disparities are magnified. This hasthe potential to distort the perception of slope in depth an importantcue to landing, because the slope cue provided by binocular disparityconflicts with veridical cues to slope, such as texture gradients andmotion parallax. In the experiments, eight observers viewed sparse anddense textured surfaces tilted in depth under three viewing conditionsnormal stereo equal to IPD hyperstereo 4 times IPD, and hypostereo14 IPD. The surfaces were either stationary, or rotated slowly around acentral vertical axis. Stimuli were projected at 6m to minimise conflictbetween accommodation and convergence, and stereo viewing wasprovided by a Zscreen and passive polarised glasses.  Observersmatched perceived visual slope using a small tilt table set by hand. Wefound that slope estimates were distorted by hyperstereopsis, but to alesser degree than predicted by disparity magnification. This distortionwas almost completely eliminated when motion parallax was present.655718, Session 4Hyperstereopsis in helmetmounted NVDs Time tocontact estimationP. R. Flanagan, Deakin Univ. Australia G. W. Stuart, P. Gibbs,Defence Science and Technology Organisation AustraliaSome night vision systems have sensors mounted on the sides of thehelmet with visual output projected onto a display in front of theoperators eyes. This arrangement produces a situation of hyperstereopsis in which binocular cues available to the operator areexaggerated so that distances around fixation are magnified. As anobject moves towards an observer, the increased apparent distancetravelled per unit time, increases its apparent velocity and reduces itsapparent time to contact TTC. To see if hyperstereoscopic cuesinfluenced TTC judgements, over and above those produced by normalopticflow cues texture size change, texture flow rate and texture edgerate, we measured estimates of TTC with 12 observers under threeviewing conditions no stereo biocular, normal stereo equal to IPDand hyperstereo 4 times IPD. Motion towards a surface was simulatedusing computergenerated graphics and stereo viewing was providedby a Zscreen and passive polarised glasses. A large, randomfieldtextured vertical plane 9 metres from the observer moved towards themunder computer control, to provide TTCs of 3, 4, 5 or 6 s, anddisappeared at 3 metres. The observer had to estimate when the planewould have reached the Zscreen which was 0.84 m in front of theireyes. We found that TTC estimates were 200 ms shorter under thehyperstereoscopic condition than those under nonstereo and normalstereo, indicating that hyperstereopsis may cause observers tounderestimate TTC and this may lead operators to undershoot theground plane when landing.655719, Session 4Hyperstereo algorithms for the perception of terraindropoffsA. Mohananchettiar, V. Cevher, Univ. of MarylandCollege Park V. G.CuQlockKnopp, Army Research Lab. R. Chellappa, Univ. ofMarylandCollege Park J. Merritt, The Merritt GroupThe timely detection of terrain dropoffs is critical for autonomous offroad navigation.  In this paper, we propose a joint tracking anddetection approach for accurate and efficient terrain dropoff detectionand localization. We formulate the problem with a hyperstereo camerasystem using a regularized combination of optical flow and disparitymaps to obtain a dense depth map of the scene, and a regularizationincorporating physical smoothness constraints in the scene forestimation robustness.  Terrain dropoffs are detected using a gradientanalysis of the dense depth map with temporal tracking to increaseaccuracy of detections.  The resulting field data and estimates are thencompared with baseline data of dropoff detections obtained withhuman observers.  Also reported are experiments done to establish theperformance advantage of using hyperstereo as opposed to normalstereo.Conf. 6557 Head and HelmetMounted Displays XII Design and Applications spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 187655720, Session 4Wideangle optical systems with combiner on the basis ofthe synthesized volume holograms for HMDM.

Bayer, Zygo OpticalSystemsDue to significantly increased U.S. military involvement in deterrent,observer, security, peacekeeping and combat roles around the world, themilitary expects significant future growth in the demand for deployablevirtual reality trainers with networked simulation capability of thebattlespace visualization process.The use of HMD technology in simulated virtual environments has beeninitiated by the demand for more effective training tools. The HMDoverlays computergenerated data symbology, synthetic imagery,enhanced imagery with the actual and simulated visible environment.In previous papers we had presented the innovative design concepts,manufacture and performance of the resulting prototype AHMD.Subsequently we had evaluated the AHMD to a validate the systemperformance and its ergonomic design features and b highlight areas thatrequire improvement.This paper will present the results of the evaluation, conclusion reachedand changes made to the basic AHMD design.  In the remainder of thispaper we provide a concise description of AHMD operations, and currentdevelopment status. Then, the prototype AHMD is described in moredetail, followed by the test results of an initial evaluation of the newgeneration, ready for deployment system.The AHMD with its superior visual performance will enhance pilotssituational awareness, which greatly improves piloting and navigationtasks, enabling training in a synthetic, yet realistic environment.We conclude by mentioning several opportunities for the use of theAHMD in simulation applications, as well as implications for further work.655739, Session 4Effects of hyperstereopsis on visual perception I absolutedistance perceptionP. R. Flanagan, Deakin Univ. Australia G. W. Stuart, P. Gibbs,Defence Science and Technology Organisation AustraliaSome night vision systems have sensors mounted on the sides of thehelmet with visual output projected onto a display in front of theoperators eyes. This may affect the judgement of absolute distance bydistorting two cues. First, the required amount of vergence required toachieve binocular fusion is increased as the intercamera distanceexceeds the interocular distance. Second, there is an increase ingradients of horizontal and vertical disparity, which represent the onlypossible binocular geometric cue to absolute distance. Distortions ofabsolute distance are of interest because they moderate the effects ofhyperstereopsis on the perception of relative depth within the limits ofbinocular fusion. In the experiments, ten observers viewed a virtualfrontoparallel textured surface under three viewing conditions normalstereo equal to IPD hyperstereo 4 times IPD, and hypostereo 14 IPD.Stimuli were projected at 6m, and stereo viewing was provided by a Zscreen and passive polarised glasses. A vertical grid was displayed atvarying depths within a virtual leaf room, which provided rich depthcues. The distance of the textured surface was measured by finding thematching depth of the grid using a temporal forced choice procedure. Wefound that there was no effect of stereo viewing condition on absolutedistance judgement. This suggests that under realworld conditions,absolute distance judgement relies on monocular cues such as familiarobject size and linear perspective.655722, Session 5Applied and theoretical aspects of night vision goggleresolution and visual acuity assessmentH. L. Task, Task Consulting A. R. Pinkus, Air Force Research Lab.The image quality of night vision goggles is often expressed in terms ofvisual acuity, resolution or modulation transfer function MTF.   Theprimary reason for providing a measure of image quality is the underlyingassumption that the image quality metric correlates with the level of visualperformance that one could expect when using the device such as targetdetection or target recognition performance.  This paper provides atheoretical analysis of the relationships between these three image qualitymetrics visual acuity, resolution and MTF and presents results andanalysis from laboratory and field studies conducted to relate thesemetrics to visual performance.  The results of this analysis can also beapplied to nonimage intensifier based imaging systems such as ahelmetmounted display coupled to an image sensor.655723, Session 5Comparison of experimental vision performance testingtechniques, including the implementation of an activematrix electrophoretic ink displayM. W. Swinney, Air Force Research Lab.Standard black and white printed targets have been used for numerousvision related experiments, and are ideal with respect to contrast andspectral uniformity in the visible and nearinfrared NIR regions of theelectromagnetic EM spectrum. However, these targets lack the ability torefresh, update, or perform as a realtime, dynamic stimulus. This impactstheir ability to be used in various standard vision performancemeasurement techniques. Emissive displays, such as a LCDs, possesssome of the attributes printed targets lack, but come with a disadvantageof their own. LCDs lack the spectral uniformity of printed targets, makingthem of debatable value for presenting test targets in the near and shortwave infrared regions of the spectrum. Yet a new option has recentlybecome viable that may retain favorable attributes of both of thepreviously mentioned alternatives. The electrophoretic ink display is adynamic, refreshable, and easily manipulated display that performs muchlike printed targets with respect to spectral uniformity. This paper willcompare and contrast the various techniques that can be used tomeasure observer visual performance through night vision devices andNIR imagers  with a focus on the visible to infrared region of the EMspectrum. Furthermore, it will quantify the electrophoretic ink displayoption, determining its advantages and situations that it would be bestsuited for.655725, Session 5Changes in distance estimation when using night visiongoggles in changing ambient illuminationS. A. Jennings, T. Macuda, National Research Council CanadaCanada W. A.

These studies, calledthe Collaborative Image Intensifier Research Program CIIRP, wereaimed at determining a pilots perception and performance with nightvision goggles NVGs.  The goal of this phase of the study was todetermine the effect of NVGs on the estimation of distance betweentwo objects under varying illumination levels.Eighteen participants were divided into two groups, with one groupusing the NVGs in a high NVG illumination environment and the secondgroup using the NVGs in a very low ambient illumination condition.Subjects were asked to make exocentric distance estimates betweentwo points of light in an eye lane.The distance estimates were fitted to the form Destimate  C1 xDActualexpC2. The exponential term C2 was higher in the high lightcondition C2high  0.80 than in the low ambient light conditionC2low 0.72 and this change was statistically significant p0.007.While distance estimate errors increased with the actual distanceincreased, the increase in estimation errors was larger in the lowillumination condition than in the high illumination condition. This isbelieved to be the first time that this effect has been quantified.Implications of this finding will be discussed with respect to NVGoperation in aviation.655726, Session 5Comparison of an NVG model with experiments toelucidate temporal behaviourP.

Of particular interest was the variation of NVG gain after astrong burst of illumination.Gain reduction after a strong pulse was modeled with an exponentialtime constant for gain recovery.  A capability for temporal modulation ofthe NVG gain was also modeled with a single time constant.Laboratory measurements were performed to validate the model andtune its parameters.  Highlights of the model are described, along withselected experimental data on its validation.655737, Session 5Handsfree focus technology for night vision applicationsD. Roberts, W. Robinson, J. C. James, J. M. Cathcart, K. Lyons, L.West, T. L. Haran, T. Wasilewski, Georgia Institute of TechnologyThe lack of depth of field is a chronic problem for users of night visiongoggles.  The extremely low objective lens fnumbers required to collectsufficient light produce sharp images only over very limited ranges ofobject distances, especially for object distances less than a few meters.Manual focusing is currently the only option, which is difficult toimpossible when the user is carrying a weapon or when involved incomplex tasks.  As a result, NVG users must frequently tolerate lowresolution, defocused images that make navigation around obstaclesdifficult at best.  The Georgia Tech Research Institute has developed ahandsfree focus system for night vision application that greatlyreduces the focus problem and enables the NVG user to concentrate onthe task at hand rather than on constantly adjusting the NVG focussetting.  The system design is presented as well as an analysis of itsperformance.655727, Session 6Effects of image intensifier halo on perceived layoutJ. Zacher, T. Brandwood, York Univ. Canada P. J.

Craig,National Research Council Canada Canada R. S. Allison, YorkUniv. CanadaNight vision devices NVDs based on image intensifiers improvenighttime visibility and extend night operations for military andincreasingly civil aviation. However, NVD imagery is not equivalent todaytime vision and impaired depth and motion perception has beennoted. One potentially contributing factor to impaired perception ofspace and environmental layout is NVD halo, which is a phenomenonwhere bright light sources appear to be surrounded by a disclike halo.In this study we measured the characteristics of NVD halopsychophysically and objectively and then evaluated their influence onperception of environmental layout in a simulation experiment. Halosare generated in the device and are not directly related to the spatiallayout of the scene. We found that, when visible, halo size  but notintensity  was only weakly dependent on both source intensity anddistance. Thus, the size of halos of sources at various distance areinvariant of their distance and do not obey the normal laws ofperspective.  In simulation experiments we investigated the effect ofhalo on the judgement of an observers attitude with respect to theground during simulated flight. Night scenes containing halos showedsystematic errors in perceived slope. We discuss these results in termsof the design of NVD and of human operators to compensate forperceptual distortions.655728, Session 6Night vision goggles, laser eye protection, and cockpitdisplaysG. L. Martinsen, P. Havig, Air Force Research Lab. J. Dykes, T.Kuyk, Northrop Grumman Corp. L. McLin, Air Force Research Lab.The increasing use of lasers on the modern battlefield may necessitatethe wear of laser eye protection devices LEPDs by warfighters.Unfortunately, LEPDs that protect against visible wavelengths oftenhave reduced overall light transmittance. A wearers vision can bedegraded if light transmittance is significantly reduced, a problem that isexacerbated in low light conditions.  Wearing night vision gogglesNVGs can provide some laser eye protection but might leave areas ofthe peripheral retina exposed.  The approach to this research effort wastwo pronged.  First, the extent of a subjects field of regard FORprotected from laser exposure by wearing NVGs was measured.  In aspecialized device, subjects had the extent of their FOR measured.Then, each subject wore NVGs and the area of coverage wasdetermined.  The second part of this effort involved determining theeffects of wearing LEPDs on vision in low light conditions, with andwithout the presence of a simulated headdown display HDD.Subjects visual acuity under moonlight illumination levels wasmeasured while wearing neutral density filters and LEPDs. Similarmeasurements of subjects visual detection, both on and offaxis, weremade.  Finally, the effects of LEPD wear on visual acuity on the HDDwere determined.  The results showed that NVG wear only protectsabout 25 of the FOR.  Also, wearing LEPDs in lowlight conditionsreduces visual acuity and detection.  The presence of the HDD reducedacuity slightly but significantly.  The HDD had no effect on onaxisdetection and actually improved offaxis detection.  The reasons for thisfinal finding are unclear.655729, Session 6AH64 monocular HMD visual assessment during urbancombat in operation Iraqi freedomC. E. Rash, U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Lab. J. K.

Respondent age ranged from 23 to 43 years with a mean of33.6 years and a median of 33.5 years, the standard deviation was 5.4years.  Total flight hours across all airframes had a mean of 1483.0hours with a median of 1150 hours.  The range was between 5004000hours, with a standard deviation of 911.0 hours.

E. Bailey, J. J. Arthur III, L. J. Prinzel III, L. J. Kramer, NASALangley Research Ctr.Previous research in the development of the TaxiwayNavigation andSituation Awareness TNASA system and the Runway IncursionPrevention System RIPS have demonstrated that a HeadUp DisplayHUD enables more efficient and safer surface operations.  However,this research also noted that two of major HUD limitations duringground operations are their monochrome form and a limited, fixed fieldofregard.  A monochromatic display precludes the use of color forinformation decluttering and information cuing so the display area of aHUD must be carefully designed to provide the pilot with enoughinformation without saturating the display with clutter.  Further, HUDimagery, while allowing headout operations, is restricted to its forward,fixed fieldofview and the use of conformal imagery is, consequently,limited.Emerging Head Worn Displays HWDs are small, lightweight, full colordisplay devices that may be worn without significant encumbrance tothe user.  By coupling the HWD with a head tracker, unlimited fieldofregard may be realized for commercial aviation applications.  Therefore,headtracked HWDs may directly address the limitations of the HUDwhile retaining all of its advantages.  A previous study evaluated HWDsfor approach and landing operations.  The present work complementsthis previous work and is similar in some respects to other conceptsand architectures but with several significant differences.In the proposed paper, the results of a simulation experiment conductedat the NASA Langley Research Center are summarized.  The experimentevaluated the efficacy of headworn display applications of SyntheticVision and Enhanced Vision technology to enhance transport aircraftsurface operations, complementing the previous TNASA and RIPSwork.  The simulation experiment was conducted using a Chicago,OHare FAA Identifier ORD airport operational environment.  Fulldetails of the experimental results pertaining to the Synthetic andEnhanced Vision technologies are described in a companion paper inthe Enhanced and Synthetic Vision Systems session in this years SPIEConference.  This paper describes the specific design and evaluationresults related to the headworn display.Following a summary of the results, the implications of HWDs forcommercial business and transport aviation applications will bepresented.  Specific design and evaluation issues for HWDs are detailedrelated to the appropriateness of simulator evaluations for thesetechnologies i.e., sickness tendencies, commercial pilot acceptabilityand usability, user encumbrance due to the HWD, and overall HWDsystem latency, accuracy, and techniques for boresight and alignment.Finally, a comparison is made of the operational and safety benefitsprovided by the HWD system relative to currentday and nextday,nonHWD applications655732, Session 6Preliminary assessment of the utilization of night visiongoggles in airborne forest fire suppressionS. A. Jennings, G. Craig, R. Erdos, T. Macuda, National ResearchCouncil Canada Canada D. Filiter, B. Crowell, Ontario Ministry ofNatural Resources CanadaHelicopters are widely used in daytime forest fire suppression,conducting diverse tasks such as spotting, resupply, medicalevacuation and airborne delivery.  Potential operational improvementsnecessitate consideration of airborne fire suppression at night.Helicopter operators are likely to deal with many challenges whenoperating in the vicinity of forest fires at night, including sceneobscuration from smoke and dynamic changes in lighting conditions.Data on the use of Night Vision Goggles NVGs for airborne forest firesuppression is lacking.  To address this issue, the Flight ResearchLaboratory FRL of the Institute for Aerospace Research of the NationalResearch Council of Canada NRC, in collaboration with the OntarioMinistry of Natural Resources, performed a preliminary flight test toexamine the use of NVGs while operating near forest fires. The studyalso simulated aspects of night time water bucketing.  The preliminaryobservations from this study suggest that NVGs have potential toimprove the safety and efficiency of airborne forest fire suppression,including forest fire perimeter mapping and takeoff and landing in thevicinity of open fires.  NVG operations at some distance from the firepose minimal risk to flight, and provide an enhanced capability toidentify areas of combustion at greater distances and accuracy.However, as operations move closer to the fire, NVG flight becomesmore risk intensive as a consequence of a reduction in visibilityattributable to the adverse effects on NVG performance of the radiationand smoke emitted by the fire.  It is suggested that risk mitigationstrategies be developed to handle these situations. Although forest fireperimeter mapping and landing and departing from unpreparedlocations at night while using NVGs are feasible, pilot training andoperating procedures should recognize that NVG image quality may bedegraded, and the capacity to identify terrain and obstacles may beimpaired in the vicinity of the fire.   The preliminary results of this studysuggest that water bucketing at night is a difficult operation withelevated risk, therefore it is recommended that further investigation bepursued to determine safe operational limits for water bucketingutilizing risk mitigation strategies.  In summary, the results from thecurrent study suggest NVGs are a useful tool in fire suppression andfurther research is necessary to clarify the operational limitations andimplementation of these devices in forest fire suppression.655733, Session 6Wireless communication technology as applied to headmounted display for a tactical fighter pilotG.

The standard, due for release inJanuary of 2007, has been advanced by ARINC and the aerospacecommunity to meet the acute needs of commercial aviation for higherperformance digital video.  This paper analyzes ARINC 818 for use inmilitary display systems found in avionics, helicopters, and groundvehicles.  The flexibility of ARINC 818 for the diverse resolutions,grayscales, pixel formats, and frame rates of military displays isanalyzed as well as the suitability of ARINC 818 to support militaryrequirements for bandwidth, latency, reliability, distance, andenvironment.  Implementation issues relevant to military displays arepresented.655804, Session 1Upgraded immersive input display device I2D2D. Tremper, Naval Research Lab. A. Brosky, Cardinal Scientific, Inc.In an effort to reduce the effects of ambient light on the readability ofmilitary displays, the Naval Research Lab began investigating anddeveloping advanced handheld displays.  Analysis and research ofdisplay technologies with consideration for vulnerability toenvironmental conditions resulted in the complete design andfabrication of the handheld Immersive Input Display Device I2D2monocular.  The I2D2 combines an OLED SVGA microdisplay with anoptics configuration and a rubber pressureeyecup which allows viewability only when the eyecup is depressed.   This feature allows the I2D2to be used during the day, while not allowing ambient light to affect thereadability.  It simultaneously controls light leakage, effectivelyeliminating the illumination, and thus preserving the tactical position, ofthe user in the dark.   This paper will focus on the upgraded I2D2system as it compares to the I2D2 presented at SPIE 2006.655825, Session 1The offaxis viewing device a riflemounted sightingsystem for search and engagement from coveredpositionsT. W. Chapman, C. G. Brady, Defence Science and TechnologyOrganisation AustraliaSoldiers involved in urban operations are at a higher risk of receiving abullet or fragment wound to the head or face compared to other partsof their body. One reason for this vulnerability is the need for the soldierto expose their head when looking and shooting from behind cover.Research conducted by DSTO Australia, using weaponmountedcameras has validated the concept of offaxis shooting, but hasemphasised the requirement for a system that closely integrates withboth the soldier and his weapon. A system was required that would notadversely affect either the usability, utility or accuracy of the weapon.Several Concept Demonstrators were developed over a twoyear periodand the result of this development is the Off Axis Viewing DeviceOAVD.  The OAVD is an unpowered sighting attachment that integrateswith a red dot reflex sight and enables the soldier to scan for andengage targets from a position of cover. The image from the weaponsscope is transmitted through the OAVDs periscopic mirror system tothe soldier. Mounted directly behind the sight, the OAVD can also beswivelled to a redundant position on the side of the weapon to allownormal onaxis use of the sight. The OAVD can be rotated back intoplace behind the sight with one hand, or removed and stored in thesoldiers webbing. In May 2004, a rapid acquisition program wasinitiated to develop the concept to an In Service capability and theOAVD is currently inservice with the Australian Defence Force.655805, Session 2Validation of resized commercial AMLCD technology forcockpit avionicsP. Bendale, Interface Displays  Controls, Inc.Despite a 15year availability of resized AMLCD components, thedefence industry and military users have been reluctant to field thistechnology in operational avionics equipment. However, the urgentneed to develop and replace certain avionics displays for which nocommercial AMLCD is available and for which custom designeddevices are too expensive, indicated a need to verify the viability of aresized AMLCD option. This paper will describe development andtesting of a resized AMLCD that was conceived and designedspecifically to validate resized AMLCD technology to avionicsapplications. The application and test environment selected is a cockpitControl Display Unit CDU. We describe the CDU operationalenvironment and how the resized COTS display matched theserequirements. Results from performance and environmental tests thatwere used to validate this technology in the cockpit avionicsenvironment are provided and discussed.655806, Session 2COTS displays applied to avionics applicationsJ. T. Thomas, C. Waitman, General Dynamics Canada Ltd. CanadaAvionics displays, particularly for cockpit applications are associatedwith high performance in difficult operational environments and thuswith high cost solutions.  COTS displays have well acknowledgedlimitations but provide a potential high valueformoney solution if thisperformance can be stretched to a level compatible with fit for use.This paper will describe the initial design tradeoffs and decisions thatformed the basis for development of lowcost cockpit and missionsystems displays for a military helicopter.192 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655807, Session 2A COTS derived NVG compatible avionics displayJ. T. Thomas, A. Cavalcanti, General Dynamics Canada Ltd. CanadaMany avionics displays, particularly for cockpit applications require NVGcompatibility.  Unusually, the mission definition for the new MaritimeHelicopter Programme MHP for the Canadian Forces has identified aneed for NVG compatibility for all of the missionsystem displays.  Thispaper will describe how this new display was implemented.655808, Session 2E2D advanced Hawkeye control display unitR. Saxena, Northrop Grumman Corp. P. W. Paolillo, Naval AirSystems Command J.

Hadlich, Honeywell InternationalThe display requirements for Night Vision Imaging System NVIScompatibility have not changed since 1986 and do not reflect lessonslearned with newer technology.  The current military standard, MILSTD3009, maintains the performance requirements for Class A and Class BNVIS compatibility as were required by MILL85762 with the addition ofClass C NVIS.  These requirements do not provide meaningful guidancefor the color of black on LCDs, which are transmissive in the nearinfrared IR region where night vision goggles NVGs are most sensitive.As a result, ad hoc requirements placed upon display manufacturershave pushed beyond the measurement capability of state of the artspectroradiometers.  This paper provides recommendations to reconcilethe performance requirements needed for displays and the associatedsystems used for NVIS requirements verification.  The firstrecommendation is that the black background NVIS radiancerequirement be established as 1.6E10 NRb for all displays.  It is alsorecommended that all colors, including black, use the white scalingfactor to determine the reported value for NVIS radiance.  NVIS radiancewill then be reported at a single operating point.  The finalrecommendation is to lower the spectroradiometer sensitivityrequirement of Appendix A of MILSTD3009 to a level which isequivalent to the recommended 1.6E10 NRb NVIS radiance value.  Thiswill help meet the intent of the military specifications which strive forrepeatable, highquality measurements of NVIS radiance.655810, Session 3Real time image enhancement for vehicle mounted andman portable display systemsT. L. P. Olson, H. C. Lee, D. Manville, J. Puritz, DRS Technologies,Inc.It is critical in surveillance applications to be able to extract features inimagery that may be of interest to the viewer at any time of the day ornight.  Infrared IR imagery is ideally suited for producing these types ofimages.  However, even this imagery is not always optimal.  Processingthe imagery with a local area image operator can enhance additionalfeatures and characteristics in the image that provide the viewer with animproved understanding of the scene being observed.  This paperdiscusses the development of an algorithm for image enhancement forinfrared imagery using local area processing. The enhancementalgorithm extends theory previously developed for medical applications.Algorithm differences addressed include application to IR imagery andto a panning camera rather than still imagery.  It also discusses theobstacles encountered and overcome for insertion of this algorithm intoa 10 gimbaled midwave infrared imaging system for a variety of realtime processing applications.  This technology is directly applicable todrivers vision enhancement systems as well as other night visionssystems such as night vision goggles.655811, Session 3Design flow for implementing image processing inFPGAsM. Trakalo, G. Giles, General Dynamics Canada Ltd. CanadaA design flow for implementing a dynamic gamma algorithm in an FPGAis described.  Realtime video processing makes enormous demandson processing resources.  An FPGA solution offers advantages overcommercial video chip and DSP.  The traditional approach to FPGAdevelopment involves a system engineer designing, modelling andverifying an algorithm and writing a specification.  A hardware engineeruses the specification as a basis for coding in VHDL and testing thealgorithm in the FPGA.  This process is work intensive and theverification of the image processing algorithm executing on the FPGAdoes not occur until late in the program.The described design process allows the system engineer to designand verify a true VHDL version of the algorithm, executing in the targetFPGA.  This process yields reduced risk and development time.  Theprocess is achieved by using Xilinx System Generator in conjunctionwith Simulink from The MathWorks.  System Generator is a tool thatbridges the gap between the high level modeling environment and thedigital world of the FPGA.  System Generator is used in developing thedynamic gamma algorithm for a candidate display product.  The resultsof this effort are to increase the dynamic range of the displayed video,resulting in a more useful image for the user.655812, Session 3Image analysis and understanding using super resolutionH. C. Lee, T. L. P. Olson, D. Manville, G. Cloud, DRS Technologies,Inc.Superresolution SR provides a capability to improve the resolution ofundersampled systems.  This allows for warfighter display systems tohave higher apparent resolution than possible with the detectorelements alone.  Through the tradeoff of temporal information, asignificant increase in spatial resolution is obtainable. This improvementis quantifiable by using Airys disc analysis along with camera sensorpitch.  Integrate the use of Airys disc to quantify the imageimprovement in resolvability and ultimately image range. It is thiscomparison that sets the ground work for realistic expectations.  OurSR system is also a natural tracker of moving vehicles with the additionof improved target resolvability.  Super Resolution can capitalize oncamera platforms instability.  A by product of SR is digitally stabilizedimagery to a fraction of a subpixel.  Investigation into subpixelremapping has lead to the developed of improved super resolvedimages.  Another, approach investigated has lead to the development ofa window management scheme for further improvement.  The cleaneran image is from a noise and structural pointofview, the moreamenable it is to sharpening in the composite SR image. Mapping into atransform space greatly reduces the correlation complexity whichmakes it easier to realize the complete algorithm into hardware.  Wehave implemented this system into a realtime architecture. Thehardware configuration is composed of an FPGA and supporting DSPprocessor.Conf. 6558 Display Technologies  Applications for Defense,Security,  Avionics spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 193655813, Session 3Advances in temporally multiplexed multiscopic displaysV.

Progress in the development of the optical design andcorresponding hardware and software will be reported on.655814, Session 3Shortwave infrared imager cockpit lighting interfaceissuesP. L. Marasco, Air Force Research Lab.With the introduction of the nightvision goggle NVG into vehiclecockpits, the transfer of visual information to the observer became morecomplex.  This problem stems primarily from the fact that the imageintensifier tube photocathode was sensitive to much of the visiblespectrum.  NVGs were capable of sensing and amplifying visiblecockpit light, making the observation of the scene outside of thecockpit, the primary use for NVGs, difficult if not impossible.  Onesolution was to establish mutually exclusive spectral bands a band ofshorter wavelengths reserved for transmission of visible informationfrom the cockpit instrumentation to the observer and a longerwavelength region left to the night vision goggle for imaging the nightenvironment.  Several documents have been published outlining thenight vision imaging system NVIS compatible lighting performanceenabling this approach, seen as necessary for military and civilianaviation.  Recent advances in short wave infrared SWIR sensortechnology make it a possible alternative to the image intensifiers fornight imaging application.  However, applicationspecific integrationissues surrounding the new sensor type must still be thoroughlyinvestigated.  This paper examines the impact of the SWIR spectralsensitivity on several categories of cockpit lighting and explores thepossibility of expanding current NVIS compatible lighting requirementsto address issues that arise from the SWIR spectral sensitivity.655815, Session 4Stainless steel display evaluationD. G. Hopper, F. M. Meyer, S. Longo, Air Force Research Lab. T. L.Trissell, General Dynamics Corp.Active matrix organic light emitting diode AMOLED technology is onecandidate to become a low power alternative in some applications tothe currently dominant, active matrix liquid crystal display AMLCD,technology.  Furthermore, fabrication of the AMOLED on stainless steelSS foil rather than the traditional glass substrate, while presenting aset of severe technical challenges, opens up the potential for displaysthat are both lighter and less breakable.  Also, transition to an SS foilsubstrate may enable rollable displayslarge when used but small forstowage within gear already worn or carried or installed.  Research hasbeen initiated on AMOLEDSS technology and the first 320 x 240 colorpixel 4in. demonstration device has been evaluated in the AFRLDisplay Test and Evaluation Laboratory.

A. Reis, P. Havig, E. Heft, J. McIntire, W. Bell, Air Force ResearchLab.Volumetric displays allow users to freely view 3D imagery withoutspecial eye wear.  However, due to low display resolution, many colorsappear distorted compared to their representation on a flatpaneldisplay.  In addition, due to the unique nature of the display, someshapes, objects, and orientations can also appear distorted.  This studyexamines the perceptual range of virtual objects in a Perspecta threedimensional 3D volumetric display to determine which combination ofcolor, position, object, and orientation produces the best 3D image.  Inthe first experiment participants viewed three stimuli a vertical square,an empty cube or a filled cube. They then named the color of theobject, rated how solid the object seemed, and finally rated amount andannoyance of visual flicker. In a second experiment, participants viewedsets of three virtual objects for each trial squares that were orientedvertically, squares oriented at a 45degree angle, squares oriented nearhorizontal, or cubes. Participants were required to identify the colorbeing displayed, identify which shape looked best side or middle, andrate both the amount and annoyance of visual flicker.  A thirdexperiment investigated the perceived solidity of virtual cubes drawnwith various methods.  Results are discussed in terms of the optimalcolor, shape, position, and orientation requirements for subjectiveviewing quality and comfort.655818, Session 4Metrics for 3D displaysP. R. Havig, D. Aleva, J. Moore, G. Saini, E. Heft, J. McIntire, AirForce Research Lab. T. L. Trissell, General Dynamics Corp.There has been much research on many different aspects of imagequality for 2D displays. These range from objective type metrics e.g,luminance contrast, saturation contrast, resolution, etc. to moresubjective metrics e.g,. Rate the quality of the display from 1  5, tometrics in between subjectiveobjective in which observers are askedto perform a task and their performance determines the goodness ofthe display. We would like to start identifying these similar types ofmetrics for 3D displays. In this case many of the traditional metrics donot work. We first attempted to get traditional objective type metrics fortwo 3D displays, the Sharp RD3D autostereoscopic and the Perspectavolumentric from Acuality. We discuss what worked and what did notas well as new objective measures we propose for 3D displays.Secondly we will discuss both subjective and subjectiveobjectivemetrics that have been used in the past, how well they may work for oursituation as well as developing new metrics of these types. We finallywill put forward our lessons learned in the hopes of generatingdiscussion for future research to help display developers in theirendeavors for new and innovative 3D displays.Conf. 6558 Display Technologies  Applications for Defense,Security,  Avionics194 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655820, Session 5Linear perspective limitations on VR and realisticdisplaysL. A. Temme, U.S. Army Aeromedical Research Lab.There is a tendency to consider the rich images from natural world asthe gold standard against which displays should be judged.  Therealism of photorealistic displays has an intuitive appeal after all, whatcould be better  They look like the real world.  Part of the shortcomingof this intuitive appeal is its naivet.  Realism itself is full of potentialillusions we just dont notice them since most of the time realism isgood enough for our everyday tasks.  But when confronted with tasksthat go beyond those for which our visual system has evolved, we maybe blindsided.  If we survive, blind to our erroneous perceptions, we willnot be any wiser next time.Realist displays depend on linear perspective LP, the mathematicalmapping of three dimensions onto two.  Despite the fact that LP is aseductively elegant system that predicts results with definedmathematical procedures, the people with the most experience with LP,artists, do not stick to the procedures because, if followed explicitly,they produce ugly, limited, and distorted images.  If artists bother withformal LP procedures at all, they invariably temper their LP renderingsby eye.The present paper discusses LP assumptions, limitations, anddistortions.  It provides examples of kluges that have been used tocover some of these LP shortcomings.  This is important so that we letneither naive assumptions nor the seductive power of LP tounrealistically guide our thinking or expectations as we develop modernHUDs, HMDs and VR displays.655821, Session 5Brightness limitations in integrated lighting systemsT.

J. Gallimore, Wright State Univ. R. S. Woodley, 21st CenturySystems, Inc. A. Barnes, Wright State Univ.To facilitate decision making tasks, it is necessary to be able see thesituation. An enormous array of intelligence gathering, database, andsensor sources of information are available. Methods for visualizing theinformation must be established and information presented in such away that human attention is captured and maintained on the mostcritical aspects of the information. Visualizations need to adapt to thechanging circumstances to show the most relevant information at thattime. We propose a cutting edge system that allows the user to adjustthe visualization to user goals and needs, monitor the effectiveness ofthe visualization, propose changes, and adapt display information forthe user. We are developing a system called Holistic Analysis,Visualization,  Characterization Assessment Tool HAVCAT that usesintelligent agents that interact with the user to provide the correctinformation at the right time. We examine visualization methods such as2D3D real pictures, 2D3D virtual spaces, colors of uncertainty, flythrough of terrain or virtual spaces, and animation. HAVCAT agents usedatamining techniques to locate and extract relevant information. TheHAVCAT evidence reasoning agent distills the data and extracts themost pertinent actions or consequences. The user will be able todynamically adjust the input streams and adjust the visualizations,receiving feedback from the agents to provide options for the display.The result is the user will be more in tune with the task by having avisualization that is custom made to the users abilities and to thedynamic nature of the task goals.655823, Session 5Optical security and anticounterfeiting using 3D screenprintingW.

J. Kramer, S. P. Williams, R. E. Bailey, L. J. Glaab, NASA LangleyResearch Ctr.Synthetic vision is a computergenerated image of the external scenetopography that is generated from aircraft attitude, highprecisionnavigation information, and data of the terrain, obstacles, culturalfeatures, and other required flight information.  A synthetic visionsystem SVS enhances this basic capability with realtime integrity toensure the validity of the databases, perform obstacle detection andindependent navigation accuracy verification, and provide trafficsurveillance.  Over the last 5 years, NASA and its industry partners havedeveloped and deployed SVS technologies for commercial, business,and general aviation aircraft which have been shown to providesignificant improvements in terrain awareness and reductions in thepotential for ControlledFlightIntoTerrain incidents  accidentscompared to current generation cockpit technologies.It has been hypothesized that SVS displays can greatly improve thesafety and operational flexibility of flight in Instrument MeteorologicalConditions IMC to a level comparable to clearday VisualMeteorological Conditions VMC, regardless of actual weatherconditions or time of day.  An experiment was conducted to evaluateSVS and SVSrelated technologies as well as the influence of where theinformation is provided to the pilot e.g., on a HeadUp or HeadDownDisplay for consideration in potential lower landing minima credit forlanding based upon aircraft and airport equipage.  The operationalconsiderations evaluated under this effort included reduced ceiling,visibility, and airport equipage requirements, such as approach lightingsystems, for SVSequipped aircraft.  Another objective of thisexperiment was to define test and evaluation methods to help futuregovernment and industry certification activities for synthetic andenhanced vision technologies.  Conclusions and future researchdirections are discussed.655902, Session 1EGPWS on synthetic vision primary flight displayG. He, T. Feyereisen, Honeywell International, Inc. K.

Schiefele, Jeppesen GmbH Germany D. Howland,Jeppesen N. Barraci, A. Sindlinger, U. Klingauf, Technische Univ.Darmstadt GermanyDuring the last years Jeppesen has developed terrain, obstacle andairport databases as well as different electronic displays as part of theNASA Aviation Safety Program. This paper describes the continuationof this work, which is now focused on a completely dynamic channeldepiction of navigation procedures inside a SVS display.A human factors workshop has been conducted with pilots from theGA, BA and CA segment to identify the pilots expectations andrequirements for channel guidance. The workshop covered three maintopics of the program. A general information and task analysis revealedwhat information the pilots need while flying a procedure. The two othersessions dealt with the generation of the channel trajectory and thedepiction of the channel trajectory.The channel trajectories are generated dynamically using the flightdynamics of the aircraft in order to make the trajectory easily flyableeven in turns and within the performance parameters of the aircraft.Trajectories can be generated for ARINC424 coded STARs andapproaches. Additional trajectories and guidance cues for interceptingor reentering a procedure are generated, as well as ATC commands likeradar vectors and missed approach procedures. The generatedtrajectories are verified to ensure they do not conflict with special useairspaces, obstacles and terrain.Different concepts for the trajectory depiction have been implementedin order to study the repelling nature of the tunnel walls while avoidingdiscontinuities when leaving the tunnel completely as observable e.g. inthe NASAs crows feet concept. Another studied idea was, not to usethe corner of the tunnel as guidance symbol, but the medians of thefour tunnel walls.Finally, all components of the new SVS display have been compared ina simulator evaluation. Different scenarios have been used to validatedifferent ways to generate guidance and intercept trajectories as well asthree different tunnel depictions on STARs, Approaches and RadarVectors. The situational awareness of the pilots has also beensupported by a simple navigation display which shows the channels infront of a synthetic terrain depiction.This paper described investigated display concepts and focuses on adetailed analysis of the final simulator evaluation.655904, Session 1Fused enhanced and synthetic vision system EVSSVSfor rotorcraft operationsC.

The system includes a number of sensors active, EnhancedVision EVS sensors such as infrared and millimeter wave systems, andstored Synthetic Vision SVS sensors such as a terrain database. Arealtime 3dimensional terrain sensing radar corrects any errors in theapriori database information. All streams active and synthetic arefused in real time and presented to the pilot in a cognitively effectivedisplay, much improved from current obstacle display and lowlevelnavigation systems.Particular effort was expended on the human factor aspects of thesystem, and its functional value is being evaluated by military helicopterpilots.  The evaluation has three principal goals 1 the willingness to usethe SVS database for terrain awareness during low level flight 100200feet AGL when FLIR is unavailable or degraded 2 the value of realtime terrain validation, and 3 the usefulness of being able to switch orcombine different sources of terrain information, e.g., IR, SVS, RF, onthe fly as conditions warrant.  The pilots choices of relative brightnessfor the different sources of terrain information is also being assessed.655905, Session 1Making a landgoaround decision with runwayincursions in near zerozero weatherD.

This problem onlyincreases in difficulty when the weather and airfield conditions becomeseverely degraded.  Such is the case in this Air Force ResearchLaboratory work, which focused on the decision making process ofaircrew landing under near zerozero weather at an unimproved airfield.This research is a part of a larger demonstration effort using sensortechnology to land in zerozero weather at airfields that offer no orunreliable approach guidance.  Using various headup HUD and headdown HDD display combinations that included the sensor technology,pilot participants worked through the decision of whether the airfieldwas safe to land or goaround.  The runway was considered unsafe onlyif the boundary of the runway was broken by an obstacle causing anincursion.  A correct decision is one that allowed the aircrew to land ona safe runway and to goaround when an incursion was present.  Whilegoing around is usually considered a safe decision, in this case a falsepositive could have a negative mission impact by preventingsubsequent landing attempts.  In this study we found a combination ofdisplay formats that provided the greatest performance without makingsignificant changes to an existing avionics suite.655906, Session 1Flight assessment of an integrated DNAW helicopterpilotage display system flight trials Hawk OwlJ. Sadler, D. Thorndycraft, P. Longman, D. Marsden, QinetiQ UnitedKingdomMilitary helicopter operations are often constrained by environmentalconditions including low light levels and poor weather. Recentexperience has also shown the difficulty presented by certain terrainwhen operating at low altitude by day and night. For example, poor pilotcues over featureless terrain with low scene contrast, together withobscuration of vision due to wind blown and recirculated dust at lowlevel brown out. These sorts of conditions can result in loss of spatialawareness and precise control of the aircraft.  Atmospheric obscurantssuch as fog, cloud, rain and snow can similarly lead to hazardoussituations due to reduced situational awareness.

Displays are rendered egocentrically, from the pointof view of the pilot. The utility of the information provided on SVSdisplays is subject to the accuracy, reliability and integrity of both thedatabase information used to create the imagery, and the calculatedeye point.Certified synthetic vision systems, however, do not yet qualify foroperational credit in any domain, other than to provide enhancedsituation awareness. As promising as SVS technology may be, it is notknown at this time whether the information provided by the system canbe judged sufficiently robust to substitute for natural vision.In this paper an operations concept is described for the use SVSinformation during a precision instrument approach in lieu of visualcontact with the approach light system. It proposes an operation withinthe existing framework of regulations, and identifies specific areas thatmay require additional regulatory guidance to consider certification ofthe proposed operational credit.  The larger purpose of the paper is toprovide a concrete example application which will require theelaboration and resolution of issues that will almost certainly beapplicable to many application domains. To this end, issues in severalcategories are identified and a substantial review of prior research isprovided.655907, Session 2Use of Xband weather radar to support the terraindatabase integrity monitoring and terrain referencednavigation functionA. Singh, M. Uijt de Haag, Ohio Univ.To enable safe use of Synthetic Vision Systems SVS at lower altitudes,realtime sensor measurements are required to ensure the integrity ofterrain and obstacle models stored in the system and to detect hazardsthat may have been omitted from the stored models.  This paperdiscusses various aspects of using Xband weather radar for terraindatabase integrity monitoring and terrain referenced navigation. Variousfeature extraction methods will be addressed to support the correlationprocess between the weather radar measurements and the storedterrain databases. Furthermore, improved weather radar antennamodels will be discussed to more reliably perform the shadow detectionand extraction SHADE functionality. In support of the navigationfunction, methods will be introduced to estimate aircraft stateinformation, such as velocity, from the geometrical changes in theobserved terrain imagery. The outputs of these methods will becompared to the state estimates derived from Global PositioningSystem GPS and Inertial Navigation System INS measurements. Allmethods discussed in this paper will be evaluated using flight test datacollected with Ohio Universitys King Air in Juneau, AK, with NASAsDC8 in Reno, NV and with a Gulfstream V in Reno, NV GVSITE.655908, Session 2Enhanced and synthetic vision system for autonomousall weather approach and landingB. R. Korn, Deutsches Zentrum fr Luft und Raumfahrt e.V.GermanyEnhanced Vision Systems EVS are aiming to alleviate restrictions inairspace and airport capacity in lowvisibility conditions. EVS relies onweatherpenetrating forwardlooking sensors that augment the naturallyexisting visual cues in the environment and provide a realtime image ofprominent topographical objects that may be identified by the pilot. Thebasic idea behind the technology is to allow VMC operations underIMC. The recently released in spring 2004 final rule of the FAA forEnhanced Flight Vision Systems EFVS for part 92 aircraft businessaircraft, general aviation aircraft clearly acknowledges the operationalbenefits of such a technology by stating the following Use of an EFVSwith a HUD may improve the level of safety by improving positionawareness, providing visual cues to maintain a stabilized approach, andminimizing missed approach situations. Moreover, The pilot would usethis enhanced flight visibility ... to continue the approach from DH orMDA  down to 100 ft above the touchdown zone elevation of therunway of intended landing. This rule change marks a significant tokenof confidence towards EVS technology and clearly demonstrates thatEVS offers the capability to decrease landing minima and thus, increaseaccessibility of airports even of nonequipped airports under lowvisibility conditions. Furthermore, they offer the possibility for reductionof radar separation in case the pilot is able to clearly detect the leadingaircraft in the sensor image. One mayor advantage of EVS is that it canbe easily used in combination with other landing aids like e.g. SBAS.Allowing the pilot to see under low visibility conditions, EVS increasessafety and offers the possibility to increase accessibility and capacity byreducing landing minima or even by reducing separation distances.Conf. 6559 Enhanced and Synthetic Vision 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 197It easily can be seen that the performance of the Enhanced VisionSystem is strongly depending of the selection of imaging sensors. AtDH or MDA of the flown approach procedure the pilot has to use EVSas primary input to continue the approach down to 100ft after whichvisual contact to the runway has to be established. Infrared IR andmillimeterwave MMW sensors are currently envisaged as EVS supportof pilot vision in low visibility. One important benefit of IRsensors is thatthese sensors generate a perspective image, from which the human canderive the perceptual cues of depth to generate a threedimensionalinterpretation of the outside world. This is an important feature of theIRsensor as such a perspective sensor image can be overlaid to theoutside scene on a headup display HUD. However, the penetration ofbad weather in the infrared spectrum is remarkably poorer than theweather penetration that can be achieved by MMWradar. An activeMMWradar delivers primarily information about the range and theangular direction azimuth of a certain object. This rangeangleinformation can be transformed into a view outofthewindow, butthere is still a lack of information about the objects height or theirvertical position. The presentation of such images needs knowledgeabout the surrounding elevation, which often is estimated by the socalled flatearthassumption.An important topic for integrating new visual sensors into existingcockpit environments concerns the question on how to visualize theacquired images andor visual cues. An obvious method for showingthis information is a simple overlay onto the headupdisplay HUD.Due to its simplicity this method has been applied in several projects inthe past.Within its research project ADVISEPRO Advanced visual system forsituation awareness enhancement  prototype, 2003  2006 that will bepresented in this contribution DLR has combined elements of EnhancedVision and Synthetic Vision to one integrated system to allow all lowvisibility operations independently from the infrastructure on ground.The core element of this system is the adequate fusion of all informationthat is available onboard. In principle, high precision onboardnavigation data in combination with an accurate airport database issufficient to enable the pilot to land the aircraft Synthetic VisionSystem. But under low visibility condition, the pilot cannot verifywhether these information are correct, or if there are errors in either thenavigation data or in the airport database. Up to now, sufficient integrityneither of available airport databases nor of onboard navigationcombination of DGPS with INS can be guaranteed. Therefore, withoutadditional means to verify the correctness of such information,approach and landing cannot be performed under such circumstances.In the ADVISEPRO system, the necessary verification of navigation andairport database integrity monitoring is obtained by the additional useof weather penetrating imaging sensors an MMW radar sensor and along wave infrared camera. Significant structures, e.g. like the runwayitself, are extracted from the sensor data automatically by means ofmachine vision and checked whether they match with the navigationdata in combination with database information. Furthermore, the sensorimages are analysed to detect obstacles on the runway.Aircraft that are equipped with such a system can perform boardautonomous allweather approach and landing, only on those airportsof which accurate airport databases are available. Thus, on part ofADVISEPRO was the development of a subsystem that calculates theposition of the aircraft relative to the runway threshold based on theanalysis of the senor data only sensor based navigation.The key modules of the ADVISEPRO system are1. Integrity monitoring of navigation data and terrain dataVerification of onboard navigation data DGPS  INS with sensor dataMMWRadar, IRSensor, Radar altimeter  and airport  terraindatabases.2. Sensor based navigationDetermination of the aircrafts position relative to the runway byautomatically analysing sensor data MMW, IR, radar altimeter withoutusing neither DGPS nor precise knowledge about the airport geometry.3. Obstacle detectionDetection of obstacles on the runway.4. Consistent description of situationCoordination, evaluation and fusion of the information processingsystems pos 1 3  to a consistent and reliable description of thesituation to be displayed to the pilot.Altogether, more than 100 flights approaches and landings have beenperformed within ADVISEPRO for acquisition of sensor data as well asfor successful verification of the system.655909, Session 2Towards an inexpensive computer visionbasedautomated landing system for unmanned aerial vehiclesK. Blenkhorn, S. OHara, 21st Century Systems, Inc.Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs currently require a dedicatedpilot for landing, adding significant cost and complexity to UAVdeployment. Existing automated landing systems typically requirespecialized equipment both at the landing site and on the aircraft. Ourproposed system for UAV autolanding requires minimal landing sitepreparation, no additional electronics, and no additional aircraftequipment of any kind. This is a JointUAV solution that will workequally well for landbased aircraft and for shipboard recoveries.Our proposed system requires only a simple target that can bepermanently painted on a runway, temporarily marked in dirt, or laid outwith chemlights for night operations. Its appearance is unique whenseen from the optimal approach path, and from other angles itsperspective distortion indicates the needed correction. By makingcontinual adjustments based on this feedback, the plane can land in avery small area at the desired angle.We time the pretouchdown flare using only a 2D visual reference. Weuse a biomimeticallyinspired algorithm to determine the distance to thelanding target. Assuming a constant closing speed, we can estimate thetime to contact and initiate a controlled flare at a predetermined interval.The aircraft then switches to using distant targets as references toensure a straight rollout after touchdown.Using these techniques to determine approach path and flare timing,the proposed system will enable automated landings in difficultconditions including heavy seas, moving ships, and crosswinds,promoting ship or land recovery for most current OTS Small and MicroUAVs.655910, Session 2Applying SVS technology to improve UAV manual controlperformanceJ. Tadema, Netherlands Defence Academy Netherlands E.Theunissen, J. Koeners, Technische Univ. Delft NetherlandsFor the manual control of the flight path of Unmanned Aerial VehiclesUAVs, the instruments provided in a UAV Control Station UCS aresimilar to those found in the cockpit of an aircraft. Typically the outofthewindow view is represented by a nosemounted camera view and aplanview display containing an electronic map is used for navigationalconformance monitoring. Obviously, the richness of the visual, motionand auditory cues that are available to the pilot of a manned aircraft isnot available to the UAV operator. In addition, the information that isavailable to the UAV operator typically suffers from low updaterates,caused by sensor and datalink bandwidth limitations. Furthermore,compared to manned aircraft, the data presented by the instruments inthe UCS is subjected to an increased latency due to the SATCOMdatalink.With the current generation UAVs one of the most demanding tasks forthe operator is the manual control task in the landing phase. Currentaccident statistics indicate that manual control related loss issignificant. A reduction in control related landing accidents might beachieved through the improvement of control performance by benefitingfrom the unexplored potential in the areas of data filtering and advanceddisplay concepts.A prototype UAV operator station has been extended with the capabilityto systematically vary sensor and datalink properties. Furthermore itcomprises functionality to mitigate undesired artifacts and includes aperspective guidance overlay. An experiment has been performed inwhich a baseline representative for the current stateoftheart UCSinstrumentation was compared with a concept that includes conformallyintegrated trajectory preview and advanced data filters.Conf. 6559 Enhanced and Synthetic Vision 2007198 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss655911, Session 2Ecological interface paradigm for remote and mobilemanipulationJ. A. Atherton, M. A. Goodrich, Brigham Young Univ.Mobile robots with manipulation capability are useful tools in dangerousor inaccessible areas.  For example, they are used in planetaryexploration Mars rovers, urban search and rescue, and explosiveordinance disposal.  In remote situations, the only connection theoperator has with the robot is the user interface.One difficulty in remote and mobile manipulation is to understand theenvironment around the robot.  Typical user interfaces show the videofeed from a camera separate from other information, such as robotposition.  This separation requires performing a mental transformationto correlate robot position with video.  When the video and telemetryare displayed in context with each other, the mental transformations arereduced.Situation awareness is especially important when the operator isdirecting multiple agents.  We can consider as an example four agentson a team mobile robot, camera mounted on the robot, attachedmanipulator, and camera mounted on the manipulator.  The agents inthe team are displayed together in a way that resembles their physicalconfiguration.  Such organization encourages acquisition of situationawareness.The interface we present displays a synthesized view of the mobilerobot, manipulator arm, and telemetry.  The video feeds are projectedonto a plane in front of each camera in virtual space.  The virtual viewacts as a common frame of reference for all agents in the system.Ecological interfaces provide grounding for team coordination.Although the above example directly applies to mobile manipulation,the ideas are applicable to other teams.  For example, a teamcomposed of multiple UAVs, UGVs, and humans.The scope of this paper is to explain the requirements of an ecologicalinterface for remote and mobile manipulation.655912, Session 3Design and testing of an unlimited fieldofregardsynthetic vision headworn display for commercialaircraft surface operationsJ. J. Arthur III, L. J. Prinzel III, L. J. Kramer, S. P. Williams, R. E.Bailey, NASA Langley Research Ctr.Experiments and flight tests have shown that a HeadUp Display HUDand a head down, electronic moving map EMM can be enhanced withSynthetic Vision for airport surface operations.  While great success inground operations was demonstrated with a HUD, the research notedthat two major HUD limitations during ground operations are theirmonochrome form and a limited, fixed field of regard.  A potentialsolution to these limitations found with HUDs may be emerging HeadWorn Displays HWDs. HWDs are small, lightweight full color displaydevices that may be worn without significant encumbrance to the user.By coupling the HWD with a head tracker, unlimited fieldofregard maybe realized for commercial aviation applications.  In the proposed paper,the results of a ground simulation experiment conducted at NASALangley are summarized.  The experiment evaluated the efficacy ofheadworn display applications of Synthetic Vision and EnhancedVision technology to enhance transport aircraft surface operations.  Thestudy tested four display concepts 1 baseline consisting of existingcockpit displays including a Class III electronic flight bag display of theairport surface 2 a modified version a HUD and EMM displaydemonstrated in previous research 3 an unlimited fieldofregard, fullcolor, headtracked HWD with a conformal 3D synthetic vision surfaceview and 4 a fully integrated HWD concept.  The fully integrated HWDconcept is a headtracked, color, unlimited fieldofregard concept thatprovides a 3D conformal synthetic view of the airport surfaceintegrated with advanced taxi route clearance, taxi precision guidance,and datalink capability. Following a summarization of the results, theimplications of these data for commercial business and transportaviation applications for taxi operations will be presented.655913, Session 3The challenges with displaying EVS and SVS video on aheadup displayP. Howells, Rockwell Collins Flight DynamicsDisplaying video on a Headup Display from an Enhanced Visioncamera presents some unique challenges not seen on conventionalheaddown flight deck displays. All information displayed on the HUDhas to be seen against a background that can vary from bright sunlightto a dark night sky. The video has to include enough gray shadeinformation to support visual identification of runway features and theimage shown on the HUD has to be visually aligned to the real worldaccurately enough to support low visibility operations at airports. Thepilot wants to clearly see the image on the HUD but also needs to seethe real world through the display when it can be seen with the nakedeye. In addition, the video display cannot interfere with the display ofexisting flight information symbology. This paper identifies thechallenges with displaying video on the HUD from enhanced vision andsynthetic vision sources and some solutions that make this displaymedia an important part of new flight deck designs.655914, Session 3A realtime panoramic video display system for localsituational awarenessJ. L. Dale, D. Dwyer, Octec Ltd. United KingdomDistributed aperture sensor DAS systems can enhance the situationalawareness of operators in both manned and unmanned platforms.   Insuch a system, images from multiple sensors must be registered andfused into a seamless panoramic mosaic in real time, whilst beingdisplayed with very low latency to an operator.This paper describes an algorithm for solving the multipleimagealignment problem and an architecture that leverages the power ofcommercial graphics processing units GPU to provide realtimedisplay of a live panoramic mosaic.We also describe other developments aimed at integrating highresolution imagery from an independently steerable fused TVIR sensorinto the mosaic, panorama stabilisation and automatic target detection.655915, Session 3The use of configural displays to promote pilot situationawarenessJ. C. Jenkins, U.S. Air Force J. J. Gallimore, Wright State Univ.An unresolved issue in the theory of situation awareness SA is how tobest portray critical information in visual displays such that the user canquickly detect cues relevant to their current goal amid vast amounts ofother data and form the basis for Level 1 SA, the perception ofelements in the environment.  Previous research has shown that the useof configural displays allows subjects to more easily detect changes indynamic processes for integration tasks thereby enhancing operatorperformance, yet the benefit of configural displays on operator SA hasyet to be assessed.  To test whether or not the use of configuraldisplays impacts the formation of pilot situation awareness, acomputerbased study was undertaken using two presentation rates500ms and 1000ms and three display formats MilStd1787 HUD,Dualarticulated DA HUD, and the Arc Segment Attitude ReferenceASAR to present aircraft flight reference information to pilots.  One offive questions were possible following the removal of the display fromthe screen, a query about aircraft airspeed, altitude, flight path angleclimb or dive or bank angle.  The aim of the study was to demonstratethe ability to provide an increase in operator SA by utilizing emergentfeatures in configural displays to increase cue saliency and therebyincrease operator SA.  The analysis of pilots recall of aircraft flight pathangle percent correct showed that pilots were significantly more awareof aircraft attitude with the ASAR than with either the MilStd1787 orDA displays.  There was no difference among displays for recall ofactual flight path angle RMS error.  The results are discussed in termsof the use of configural displays utilizing goalrelevant systeminformation mapped onto emergent features to promote operator SA.Conf. 6559 Enhanced and Synthetic Vision 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 199655917, Session 4Prevention of runway incursions due to closed runwaysor unsuitable runway choices by enhanced crewsituational awareness and alertingC. Vernaleken, C. Urvoy, U. Klingauf, Technische Univ. DarmstadtGermanyOf all incidents on the aerodrome surface, Runway Incursions, i.e. theincorrect presence of an aircraft on a runway, are the by far most safetycritical, resulting in many fatalities if they lead to an accident. A lack offlight crew situational awareness is almost always a key causal factor inthese occurrences, and like any Runway Incursion, the special case ofchoosing a closed or unsuitable runway  including mistaking a taxiwayfor a runway  may have catastrophic consequences, as the SingaporeAirlines Flight SQ006 accident at Taipei in 2000 and, most recently,Comair Flight 5191, tragically show. In other incidents, such as UPSFlight 896 at Denver in 2001 departing from a closed runway or ChinaAirlines Flight 11 taking off from a taxiway at Anchorage in 2002, adisaster was only avoided by mere luck.This paper describes how the concept for an onboard SurfaceMovement Awareness  Alerting System SMAAS can be applied tothis special case and prevent flight crews from taking off or landing onclosed runways, unsuitable runways or taxiways, and presents initialevaluation results. An airport moving map based on an ED99ADO272A compliant aerodrome database is used to visualize runwayclosures and other applicable airport restrictions, based on NOTAM andDATIS data, to provide the crew with enhanced situational awarenessin terms of position and operational environment. If this is not sufficientto prevent a hazardous situation, e.g. in case the crew is distracted, atailored alerting concept consisting of both visual and aural alertscatches the crews attention.For runway closures and restrictions, particularly those of temporarynature, the key issue for both extended situational awareness andalerting is how to get the corresponding data to the aircrafts avionics.Therefore, this paper also develops the concept of a machinereadableelectronic Preflight Information Bulletin ePIB to bring relevant NOTAMinformation to the flight deck prior to the flight, with a possibility toreceive updates via data link while the aircraft is airborne.655918, Session 4Compact selfcontained enhancedvision sensor EVSsimulatorC. L. Tiana, Aireyes, Inc.We describe a simulation system developed by Aireyes, Inc. specificallyfor commercial Enhanced Vision System EVS sensor emulation.Current FAAapproved AFS205 systems need only reflect very basic,and rather idealized, EVS system characteristics. We believe that, asexperience with deployment and certification of these systems matures,the simulation requirements will be raised to reflect more realistic sensorperformance.  The system we describe can accurately simulate infraredmultiple spectral bands sensors as well as millimeterwave systems. Itis designed to be easily integrated in standard visual flight simulators,with minimal downtime and configuration.Unlike other current systems, this simulator can accurately representmany aspects of sensor imagery well beyond just the basic scenephenomenology e.g. thermal aspects, radar returns rather, wesuccessfully model system degradation under different weather andother obscurant conditions, noise characteristics, temporal response,failure modes, and image processing pipeline e.g. for fused systems orspecific image processing features. The system is easily configurableor customized for specific sensors and, once installed in the simulationenvironment, acts as a black box with minimal required operatorintervention. It is eminently suitable for pilot training, certification testflights, human factor evaluation, system analysis and improvement,airborne flight test support and marketing demonstrations. The systemis currently in use at a number of major EVS system development andtraining sites.655919, Session 4Flight assessment of a real time multiresolution imagefusion system for use in degraded visual environmentsM. I. Smith, Waterfall Solutions Ltd United Kingdom J. Sadler,QinetiQ United KingdomMilitary helicopter operations are often constrained by environmentalconditions, including low light levels and poor weather. Recentexperience has also shown the difficulty presented by certain terrainwhen operating at low altitude by day and night. For example, poor pilotcues over featureless terrain with low scene contrast, together withobscuration of vision due to wind blown and recirculated dust at lowlevel brown out. These sorts of conditions can result in loss of spatialawareness and precise control of the aircraft.  Atmospheric obscurantssuch as fog, cloud, rain and snow can similarly lead to hazardoussituations due to reduced situational awareness.Day Night All Weather DNAW systems applied research sponsored byUK MOD has developed a multiresolution real time Image Fusionsystem that has been flown as part of a wider flight trials programmeinvestigating increasing situational awareness. Dual band multiresolution adaptive image fusion was undertaken using imagery from aPassive Millimetre Wave Imager Unit, a Thermal Imager and a Low LightTV all cobore sighted on the rotary wing trials aircraft. A number ofsorties were flown in a range of climatic and environmental conditionsboth during day and night. Neutral density filters were used on theLLTV during daytime sorties. This paper reports on the results of theflight trial evaluation and discusses the benefits offered by the use ofImage Fusion in Degraded Visual Environments.655920, Session 4Applying daytime colors to nighttime imagery with anefficient color transfer methodG. Li, K. Wang, Jilin Univ. ChinaWe propose a color transfer method to give fused multiband nighttimeimagery a natural daytime color appearance in a simple and efficientway. Instead of using traditional l space, the proposed methodtransfers the color distribution of the target image daylight color imageto the source image fused multiband nighttime imagery in a linearcolor space named IUV. The transformation between RGB and IUVspaces is simpler than that between RGB and l spaces, moreover,the IUV space is more suitable for image fusion. Our experiments oninfrared and visual images show that the IUV based color transfermethod works surprisingly well for transferring natural colorcharacteristics of daylight color images to false color fused nighttimeimagery.655921, Session 4Semantic bifurcated importance field visualizationE. R. Lindahl, P. G. Petrov, 21st Century Systems Inc.While there are many good ways to map sensual reality to twodimensional displays, mapping nonphysical and possibilisticinformation can be challenging. The advent of fasterthanrealtimesystems allow the predictive and possibilistic exploration of importantfactors that can affect the decision maker. Visualizing a compressedpicture of the past and possible factors can assist the decision makersummarizing information in a cognitivebased model thereby reducingclutter and perhaps related decision times. Our proposed SemanticBifurcated Importance Field Visualization SBIFV uses saccadic eyemotion models to partition the display vertically with possibilistic andsensed data, and horizontally for spatial and semantic data. Saccadiceye movement precedes and prepares decision makers before nearlyevery directed action. Cognitive models for saccadic eye movementshow that people prefer lateral to vertical saccadic movement. Studieshave suggested that saccades may be coupled to momentary problemsolving strategies. Also, the central 1.5 degrees of the visual fieldrepresents 100 times greater resolution that then peripheral field, soconcentrating factors can reduce unnecessary saccades. By packinginformation according to saccadic models, we can augment potentialConf. 6559 Enhanced and Synthetic Vision 2007200 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssSynthetic Vision displays to relate important decision factors, reducefactor dimensionality, and present the dense summary dimensions ofsemantics and importance.

Khosla, C. Moore, D. J. Huber, S. E. Chelian, HRL Labs., LLCThis paper presents a bioinspired system for spatiotemporalrecognition in static and video imagery. An attention and objectrecognition system is used to determine the location and identities ofobjects in a scene at a particular time. A working memory model iscontinuously updated with object location and label data. It uses thisdata to construct and maintain ordered spatiotemporal sequences. Abioinspired classifier ascribes event labels to these sequences. Aseparate network, executed in parallel with the former, classifies anysignificant spatial relations it observes among the recognized objects.None of the algorithms in our system require offline training, and oursystem can acquire its entire knowledgebase via interactive onlinelearning if desired. The system attempts to classify all events that itobserves. If it is not confident in its classification, then it will query theuser for the events correct label and immediately acquire the newknowledge. Unknown spatial relationships can also be interactivelylearned. Our event recognition system is robust to variations in anobjects motion profile. We evaluated the performance of our system onreal world video footage of vehicles and pedestrians in a busy street.Our system is able to recognize the events in this footage involvingvehicles and pedestrians. Our system was also used to learn the spatialrelationships that compose a particular scene category in static imagery.656002, Session 1Bioinspired visual attention and object recognitionD. Khosla, C. Moore, S. E. Chelian, HRL Labs., LLCThis paper describes a neuroinspired vision system that can 1 learnrepresentations of objects that are invariant to scale, position andorientation and 2 recognize and locate these objects in static andvideo imagery. The system uses modularized neuroinspired algorithmstechniques that can be applied towards finding salient objects in ascene, recognizing those objects, and prompting the user for additionalinformation to facilitate online learning. The neuroinspired algorithmsare based on models of human visual attention, search, recognition andlearning. Most machine vision systems rely on techniques that mandateoffline and cannot learn new classes without retraining on all priorknowledge. This is computationally inefficient and prohibits interactivelearning. The proposed system can be trained in an online manner,meaning that new classes and instances of classes can be learned bythe system without retraining on all prior knowledge. Theimplementation is highly modular, and the modules can be used as acomplete system or independently. The underlying technologies werecarefully researched in order to ensure they were robust, fast, and couldbe integrated into an online system. We evaluated our systemscapabilities on the Caltech 101 and COIL 100 datasets, which arecommonly used in machine vision, as well as on simulated scenes.Preliminary results are quite promising in that our system is able toprocess these datasets with good accuracy and low computationaltimes.656003, Session 1A novel contentbased videoimage retrieval method forsurveillance and forensic applicationsK. Vadakkeveedu, R. Fernandes, Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.The advances in video surveillance technology have lead to theproliferation of surveillance video cameras on looking areas of interest.Counter terrorism and surveillance applications require video forensicscapabilities like querying and searching video data for events, people orobjects of interest. A human analyst may accurately spot a suspiciousactivity in a small segment of video. However, due to the large volume ofdata collected in realtime video surveillance, it is impractical for humananalysts to watch or tag the entire video collected as this can lead tohuman errors, lower throughput and inconsistencies in the level ofscrutiny. Alternate approaches like automatic tagging may lead toinaccurate or incomplete tags, which may lead to inadequate queryingand searching capabilities. In this paper we explore a contentbasedvideoimage retrieval approach.We propose an event object dictionary based video retrieval method.First a dictionary of events objects of interest is created. In an eventdictionary, every event of interest to the video forensics application isindexed against one or more textual tags. The event data contains ashort video clip and feature vectors relevant to event identification. Weused a small set of features relevant to video surveillance. Featureextraction, classification and indexing are performed on the realtimevideo data in short segments. A users textual query is converted to acontentbased query using the event dictionary. Event dictionarycreation is computationally constant time activity for a given number ofevents and features. This method is also modified to realize objectdictionary based image retrieval.656004, Session 1Behavior recognition using cognitive swarms and fuzzygraphsS. Medasani, Y. Owechko, HRL Labs., LLCBehavior analysis, a critical component of next generation visualsurveillance systems, deals with understanding and parsing a videosequence to generate a highlevel description of object actions andinterobject interactions. In this paper, we describe a visionbasedbehavior recognition system that can model and detect spatiotemporalinteractions between detected entities in a visual scene. A hierarchicalgeneric event detection scheme is proposed that uses fuzzy graphicalmodels for representing the spatial associations as well as the temporaldynamics of scene entities. The spatial and temporal attributes ofassociated objects and groups of objects are handled in separate layersin the hierarchy. In the spatial organization layer, fuzzy graphs are usedto model the spatial relations between objects while in the temporalorganization layer, directed fuzzy graphs are used to model thetemporal behaviors of objects. We also describe a new behaviorspecification language that helps the user analyst easily describe theevent that needs to be detected using either simple linguistic queries orgraphical queries. We present results that show the performance of theproposed system on complex data sets.656005, Session 1A multicamera system for realtime pose estimationA. E. Savakis, J. M. Hnatow, J. Schimmel, M. J. Erhard, RochesterInstitute of TechnologyThis paper presents a multicamera system for intelligent computingthat performs face detection and pose estimation in realtime and maybe used within a visual sensor network for surveillance or humancomputer interaction.  The system consists of a Scene View CameraSVC, which operates at a fixed zoom level, and an Object ViewCamera OVC, which continuously adjusts its zoom level to matchobjects of interest.  The SVC is set to survey the whole filed of view.Once a region has been identified by the SVC as a potential object ofinterest, e.g. a face, the OVC zooms in to locate specific features.  Inthis system, face candidate regions are selected based on skin colorand face detection is accomplished using a Support Vector Machineclassifier.  The locations of the eyes and mouth are detected inside theface region using neural network feature detectors.  Pose estimation isperformed based on a geometrical model, where the head is modeledas a spherical object that rotates upon the vertical axis. The triangleformed by the mouth and eyes defines a vertical plane that intersectsthe head sphere. By projecting the eyesmouth triangle onto a twodimensional viewing plane, equations were obtained that describe thechange in its angles as the yaw pose angle increases.  These equations202 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssare then combined and used for efficient pose estimation.  The systemachieves realtime performance for live video input.

Xia, J. Chen, W. Hu, National Univ. of Defense Technology ChinaRecent researches in object recognition have demonstrated theadvantages of representing objects and scenes through localizedpatterns such as small image templates, which are normalization ofimage primitives. These primitives may correspond to intuitivelyunderstandable object parts. As a basis, in the online setting, thesekinds of patterns, whose number and corresponding statistical features,cannot be known beforehand, and it eventually becomes infeasible tomemorize all previously seen input samples.Noticing the nature characteristic of the human brainan incrementalstudying style, especially the supervising and selfsupervisingcombined method of studying during the proess of intelligentdevelopment, based on an RSOMRecursive SelfOrganizing Mapping algorithm, a framework of extended autonomous learning is advanced.In this framework, a pool of discriminable patterns are clusterd into anRSOM tree, and the local statistics of different discriminable patternsare calculated in different leaf nodes of the RSOM tree. For eachincoming sample, the NaveBayesbased consistency estimation of acorresponding leaf nodes, will be used to determine if it is a sample of aNEW discriminable pattern. If yes, the sample will automatically labelledas an unknown pattern. If the similar samples are frequently input intothe RSOM, the system will ask for supervising. Thus a system canautonomously get KNOWLEDGE according to the experience of itself.The proposed framework is not tied to any specific pattern type or datadomain. In this paper, a video imagebased intelligent multiobjectrecognition system is developed, which proves the feasibility andvalidity of the method.656007, Session 1Analysis of the mapseeking circuit in early visionapplicationsJ. Jelinek, Honeywell TechnologyIn his recent book on visual cognition David Arathorn proposes a newcomputational mechanism for early vision and demonstrates its utilitythrough a number of computer simulations. He calls its basic buildingblock the mapseeking circuit and describes both its algorithmic andneuronal implementations.In our paper we present mathematical analysis of the circuit. We firstderive the nonlinear difference equations describing its dynamics andfind their steady state solutions. Next we formulate an imagetomemory matching problem with a straightforward intuitive interpretationand show that the mapseeking circuit transient can be understood as avery fast iterative computation of the best match in the given sense.Recasting the circuit as the matcher also offers another viewpoint at itsbehavior Its steady state represents an integral transform of the imagewith respect to the nonorthogonal basis formed by the predefinedmemories and thus can be seen as the best image descriptionexpressible in terms of the basis.656008, Session 2Artificial immune system approach for air combatmaneuveringJ. T. Kaneshige, K. Krishnakumar, NASA Ames Research Ctr.Since future air combat missions will involve both manned andunmanned aircraft, the primary motivation for this research is to enableunmanned aircraft with intelligent maneuvering capabilities. During aircombat maneuvering, pilots use their knowledge and experience ofmaneuvering strategies and tactics to determine the best course ofaction. As a result, we try to capture these aspects using an artificialimmune system approach. The biological immune system protects thebody against intruders by recognizing and destroying harmful cells ormolecules. It can be thought of as a robust adaptive system that iscapable of dealing with an enormous variety of disturbances anduncertainties. However, another critical aspect of the immune system isthat it can remember how previous encounters were successfullydefeated. As a result, it can respond faster to similar encounters in thefuture. This paper describes how an artificial immune system approachis used to select and construct air combat maneuvers. Thesemaneuvers are composed of autopilot mode and target commands,which represent the lowlevel building blocks of the parameterizedsystem. The resulting command sequences are sent to a tacticalautopilot system, which has been enhanced with additional modes andan aggressiveness factor for enabling high performance maneuvers.Just as vaccinations train the biological immune system how to combatintruders, training sets are used to teach the maneuvering system howto respond to different enemy aircraft situations. Simulation results arepresented, which demonstrate the potential of using immunizedmaneuver selection for the purposes of air combat maneuvering.656009, Session 2Parameter optimization of LSSVM for regression usingNGAQ. L. Wang, Z. Feng, K. Shida, Harbin Institute of Technology ChinaCompared with Support vector machine SVM, Least Squares supportvector machine LSSVM has overcame the disadvantage of highercomputational burden by solving linear equations instead of a quadraticprogramming problem. So, it has been widely used in classification andnonlinear function estimation. But there is no efficient method forparameter selection of LSSVM. This paper uses sharing function basedNiche genetic algorithm SNGA to optimize the parameter of LSSVMfor regression. In this work, the radial basis function RBF function isused as the kernel function. There are two free parameters viz. kernelwidth parameter, sigma s and regularization parameter , which affectLSSVM generalization performance.In the SNGA approach, kfolds cross validation is used to evaluate theLSSVM generalization performance. The inverse of the average testerror of the k trials is used as the fitness value, because the smaller theaverage test error is the better the generalization performance is.Sharing function is introduced to implement niche genetic algorithm.The hamming distance between each two individuals is defined as thesharing function. The proposed SNGA procedure is described asfollowsStep 1 Randomly generate the initial populations. Each individual isencoded in 40 binary bits.Step 2 Evaluate the fitness values of all individuals using kfolds crossvalidation and preserve the best four individuals.Step 3 Calculate the sharing function value between any twoindividuals and multiply the one with the least fitness value by thepenalty function factor if the value is greater than the sharing threshold.Step 4 Apply selection, crossover and mutation operators to generatethe next population.Step 5 Replace the worst four individuals of the current population withthe four best individuals preserved in step2.Step 6 Go to Step 2 until it has implemented G generations.Two benchmark problems, SINC function regression and Henon maptime series prediction are used as examples for demonstration. It isshowed that this approach can escape from the blindness of manmadechoice of the LSSVM parameters. It enhances the efficiency and thecapability of regression. With little modification, this approach is alsocan be used to the parameter optimization of SVM or LSSVM forclassification.Conf. 6560 Intelligent Computing Theory and Applications V spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 203656010, Session 2ASAS autonomy en routeN. Barraci, U. Klingauf, S. Bauer, M. Hartmann, Technische Univ.Darmstadt GermanyAs one big decisive step in order to cope with the predicted rise in civilaviation by the factor of 3 MW04, Gmf04 until 2020,EUROCONTROL and FAA see the development of ASAS applications. Asubset of the foreseen ASAS applications is dedicated to allowseparation and selfseparation support to the flight deck crews andground controllers.  Although the definition and scope of most of thoseASAS applications are still under research, two main issues couldalready been identified.The first main issue is holding and raising the current safety level forcivil aviation, in spite of the heavier usage of airspace due to the rise inair traffic.The second main issue is the reduction of costs, for example by risingthe efficiency for flights over oceanic airspace.  The ASAS Application InTrail Procedure in oceanic airspace ASPAITP is directed primarilytowards this issue by allowing flight level changes for specific aircraft. Itis foreseen that this will have a significant impact on flight costs.This paper presents an application which supports pilots in keeping theseparation minima BBKH06, and extends its scope to utilization inoceanic airspace. It describes constraints and aims of algorithmsdirected towards detecting and solving traffic conflicts and the requireddata and data transmission means.Initially the application was intended to support pilots flying in IFBP Inflight broadcasting procedure area, and to evaluate selfseparationalgorithms in TUDs highly configurable fixbased research flightsimulator.ReferencesMW04  David Marsh and Agnieszka Wegner.

Matson, Wright State Univ. and Univ. of Cincinnati R. K.Bhatnagar, Univ. of CincinnatiSensors are key elements to interface to and interpret an environment.The success of this interface and interpretation is a function of thecapability of the sensor.  A sensors capability can be measured by howwell it can sense specific environment variables and how it processesthe data before forwarding it to another processing agent.The primary objective of this research is to embed intelligence, using anagent, into a sensor enabling it to report actionable information ratherthan flows of merely raw data.  The agent sensor pair can then beplaced into an multiagent organization capable of integrating thecapabilities of all intelligent sensor agents.  A secondary objective is aflexible architecture allowing any combination of heterogeneoussensors to be utilized in creating an intelligent array.  The capabilitymodel of the software agent will interface the specific sensorcapabilities into the multiagent organization.An intelligent sensor is the front line application to the Intelligent SensorOrganization System ISOS.  An intelligent software agent will beteamed with a hardware sensor device to construct the intelligentsensor.  The software agent will have three main functionsmanagement of the physical sensor, interpretation of the physicalsensors data stream and integration with other intelligent sensor agentsparticipating in the organization.  The ISOS is the cooperativeintegration of all sensors into one functional team, capable of sensing acomplex environment and exhibiting traits such as robustness,survivability, and adaptability.There are two hardwaredriven approaches to this research.  The firstinvolves embedding the agent into a FPGA using VHDL as the languageor implementation.  The second approach utilizes a more generalpurpose hardware platform that allows a number of general purposeprogramming languages to be used for implementation.  The purpose isto determine which combination of hardware and software will lenditself to the development of a effective embedded intelligent agent.Each of these platforms is tied to a set of sensors to measure thevalidity and effectiveness of both approaches.The initial conclusion reached is that agents can be developed andembedded on hardware interfaced to one or more sensors.  Thesesoftware agents augment the capability of the hardware sensor andcontroller with added higher level management and data extractionpotential.  A second outcome reveals the choice of hardware platform isdependent upon required sensor and software agent capability.  Thechips which support development using general purpose languagesallow a more capable software agents, but require higher levels ofresources to support the increase functionality.656012, Session 2Game theoretical techniques for designing counterterrorism systemsS. U. Khan, The Univ. of TexasArlingtonDesigning counterterrorism systems are now almost a necessity.Protecting our investment, national and humanitarian interests are thenorm of the day. Essentially, we are aiming to design counterterrorismsystems for reducing the risks and consequences of terrorism.The objective of the work reported here is to study optimal allocation ofresources for protection of systems against intentional terroristattacks. The innovation of this work lies in the use of game theory as ananalysis tool for risk modeling. Game theory has widely been used infields of economics, communication theory, social sciences, etc. Thiswork will be leveraging upon the current state of the art attacker modelsmolded with classical game theoretical models.The motivation of this work comes from the fact that the attackers canmodify their strategies in response the defense investments. Defensewill generally be more costly when the adversary or the attackers canobserve the system defenses. In reality the attackers have a fair enoughidea about the defenses owing to our close net social infrastructure.One simply cannot assume that a defensive system can be setupwithout some leakage of critical information.If this the information leakage is unavoidable, then why do we notincorporate into our defense infrastructure. In other words, we have todetermine the optimal defense against an optimal attack. The riskanalysis tool, game theory, is a useful model for security and criticalinfrastructure protection. It is appropriate when protecting againstintelligent and adaptable adversaries, and it recognizes that defensivestrategies must account for attacker behavior.To model the system as a game between attackers and defenders, weneed to make assumptions about 1 the attacker goals and constraints,2 the defender goals and constraints, and 3 the system designfeatures. These assumptions are necessary when the system at handhas either serial or parallel defenses. Both defenses attract differenttypes of attacks. For instance, in the case of parallel defenses, theattacker must disable all components. This certainly is not the case forserial defenses. An attacker has a wide choice of targets and thedefender must protect all the components. The defender must equalizethe attractiveness of all the defended components.Designing counterterrorism systems would also require makingassumptions on the attackers knowledge. The assumption that theattackers know the defensive mechanism may not be unrealistic, due tothe openness of our sociopolitically infrastructure. Public demandsknowledge of our defenses even when this weakens its effectiveness.This increases the difficulty of defense, since the defensive measuresmay not be effective if they can easily be observed.Conf. 6560 Intelligent Computing Theory and Applications V204 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssThe design of counterterrorism systems should incorporateredundancy since it reduces attacker flexibility and increases defenderflexibility. Game theory has been used as an effective model to realizethe goals of traditional reliability design considerations, such as, spatialseparation, functional diversity, etc. We leverage upon the existingtheory for incorporating such reliability factors to mold daily life systemsinto a fortified counterterrorism system. The flexibility of using gametheory would allow us to use secrecy and deception as possibleattacker so called privileges.The major advantage of using game theory as a risk analysis tool is itsability to adapt to adverse situations. For instance, real world decisionmakers will want to withdraw or alter their decisions in case theyguessed wrong about which targets are most attractive to attackers.Recent work has suggested that attackers target the most attractivecomponents. However, the defenders are uncertain about theireffectiveness. Attackers will in general have different values for targetsthan defenders. Also, defending one target can deflect attacks totargets that are less attractive to attackers, but more damaging todefenders. Optimal defense frequently still involves allocating zeroresources to targets with a nonzero probability of successful attack,especially if 1 targets value widely in their values, and 2 defender ishighly resourceconstrained.To show the effectiveness of our risk analysis model and the gametheoretical technique, three applications have been analytically studied.These include 1 aviation security, 2 port security, and 3 electric powersecurity. In all the applications, our model shed light on appropriateallocation of resources among targets, with focus on the most attractiveand most vulnerable targets. Spend less money on targets that areunlikely to be attacked, etc.In essence, this work acts as a stepping stone for researchers workingin security research and would like to apply game theory for analysisand modeling of real world scenarios. We hope to extend this work todevelop a risk analysis toolkit based on our gaming model, costfunctions and observations.656013, Session 3Learning Bayesian network from imperfect dataenhancements to the EM algorithmK. K. R. G. K. Hewawasam, K. Premaratne, Univ. of MiamiThe recent years have seen many developments in uncertaintyreasoning taking place around Bayesian Networks BNs. BNs allow fastand efficient probabilistic reasoning. One of the key issues thatresearchers have faced in using a BN is determining its parameters andstructure for a given problem. Many techniques have been developedfor learning BN parameters from a given dataset pertaining to aparticular problem. Most of the methods developed for learning BNparameters from partially observed data have evolved around theExpectationMaximization EM algorithm. In its original form, EMalgorithm is a deterministic iterative twostep procedure that convergestowards the maximumlikelihood ML or the maximum a posterioriMAP estimates.The EM algorithm mainly focuses on learning BN parameters fromincomplete data where some of the values are missing. However inmany practical applications, partial observability results in a wider rangeof imperfections, e.g., uncertainties arising from incomplete,ambiguous, probabilistic, and belief theoretic data. Moreover, whileconvergence is to their maximum data likelihood values, the EMalgorithm does not guarantee convergence to the underlying trueparameters.In this paper, we propose an approach that enables one to learn BNparameters from a dataset containing a wider variety of imperfections.In addition, by introducing an early stopping criterion together with anew initialization method to the EMalgorithm, we show how the BNparameters could be learnt so that they are closer to the underlying trueparameters than the converged maximum data likelihood BNparameters.656014, Session 3Global stability analysis of competitive neural networkswith different timescales under perturbationsA.

Nag, D. J. Miller, The Pennsylvania State Univ. A. P. Brown, K. J.Sullivan, Toyon Research Corp.We present a system for scale and affine invariant recognition ofvehicular objects in video sequences. We use local descriptors SIFTkeypoints from image frames to model the object. These features areclaimed in the literature to be highly distinctive and invariant to rotation,scale, and affine transformations. However, since the SIFT keypointsthat are extracted from an object are instancespecific variable, theyform a dynamic feature space. This presents certain challenges forclassification techniques, which generally require use of the same set offeatures for every instance of an object to be classified. To resolve thisdifficulty, we associate the extracted keypoints to the componentsrepresentative keypoints in a mixture model for each target class.While the extracted keypoints are variable, the mixture components arefixed. The mixture models the keypoint features, as well as the locationand scale at which each keypoint was detected in the frame. Keypointto component association is achieved via a switching optimizationprocedure that locally maximizes the joint likelihood of keypoints andtheir locations and scales with the latter based on an affinetransformation. To each mixture component from a class, we link a firstlayer support vector machine SVM classifier which votes for or againstthe hypothesis that the keypoint associated to the component belongsto the models target class. A second layer SVM pools the votes fromthe ensemble of SVM classifiers in the first layer and gives the finalclass decision. We show promising results of experiments for videosequences from the VIVID database.656016, Session 4A function model for automated path prediction ofentitiesS. Nanda, SDS International, Inc. R. Pray, RPA Electronics Design,LLCAs militaries across the world continue to evolve, the roles of humans invarious theatres of operation are being increasingly targeted by militaryplanners for substitution with automation. Forward observation anddirection of supporting arms to neutralize threats from dynamicadversaries is one such example. However, contemporary tracking andtargeting systems are limited in their ability to serve autonomously,since they do not embody the sophisticated algorithms necessary toaccurately predict the future positions of adversaries with the precisionoffered by the cognitive and analytical abilities of human operators. Theneed for these systems to incorporate methods characterizing suchintelligence is therefore compelling. This paper describes a noveltechnique to achieve this goal by illustrating realworld methodologiesfor sensor data acquisition and utilization to model the path of an entity.Such paths are expressed as continuous polynomial functions ofmultiple variables in the form of Taylor series with a finite number ofterms. It demonstrates the method for computing the coefficient of eachterm to define this function for any given entity, and illustrates its use todetermine that entitys position at any time in the future.

Q.Zhao, Dartmouth College H. Xia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute andState Univ.Intelligent Foraging, Gathering and Matching IFGM combines a uniquemultiagent architecture with a novel partial processing paradigm toprovide a solution for realtime information retrieval in large and dynamicdatabases. IFGM provides a unified framework for combining theresults from various heterogeneous databases and seeks to provideeasily verifiable performance guarantees. In the previous work, IFGMhad been implemented and validated with experiments on text data,using the internet as the search space. In order to understand the effectof dynamism of documents on the various metrics and resourceallocation strategy of IFGM, a series of experiments were conductedwith pseudodynamic and full dynamic search spaces. In pseudodynamic search space, all documents except for the top 10 documentsare available from the beginning of the simulation. The top 10 documentsare introduced arbitrarily during the course of the experiment. In fullydynamic experiments, all the documents are introduced arbitrarily. Theresults were analyzed to derive valuable insights into IFGM. In thispaper, we provide analysis of the system with a focus on performance.Using analytical methods we show that partial processing saves bothtime and computing resources. The system is also extended toincorporate images in the search space using a regionbased WaveletImage Retrieval algorithm called WALRUS. A preliminary study onsemantically combining the information from images and text usinggraph structures has been made.656032, Session 4Intelligent algorithms for persistent and pervasive sensingin systems comprised of wireless ad hoc networks ofgroundbased sensors and mobile infrastructuresW. S. Hortos, Associates in Communication Engineering Researchand TechnologyWith the development of lowcost, durable unmanned air vehiclesUAVs, it is now practical to perform persistent sensing and datacollection autonomously over broad surveillance areas. These vehiclescan sense the environment directly through onboard imaging sensors,or indirectly when triggered to target areas by groundbased sensorsoperating wirelessly as an ad hoc network within the environment. Thecoupling of the swarm intelligence of the mobile infrastructure comprisedof UAVs with the antlike behavior of the unattended ground sensorscreates a level of persistent and pervasive sensing, i.e., continualcollection and analysis of sensor data on targets within an arbitrarilywide area can be achieved.  In this composite configuration, the UAVsact as intelligent agents using the ground sensors to collect data ontargets within the active narrowband phenomena, such as choke pointsand areas of ingress. To conserve limited power at sensor nodes, theground sensors apply correlative, statistical data aggregation to the setof the target phenomena to restrict the targets current location within theenvironment.  Ground sensors far from that location are deactivated,while ground sensors near the location remain active.  As the UAVsmove over the ad hoc network of surveillance area, the stillactivesensors form a distributed antenna to uplink the target locations andrelated information to the nearest vehicles in the swarm for analysis andpotential fusion with sensor data from other UAVs.  UAVs withknowledge of the ground targets persist in sensing changes in thetargets using onboard imaging sensors and processors.  Reports fromthese UAVs are then relayed to the mission controllers for further action.A critical aspect of the operational scenario is the sustained presence ofa UAV to communicate with the active ground sensors within ad hocnetworks. While a single UAV is useful for deploying new sensors andcan provide communications to isolated sensors, a singlepoint failure ofone UAV can destroy the availability of the composite sensing network tothe mission.  Multiple vehicles in a swarm, however, allow sustainedsensing in parallel or sequentially over the same ground sensors, therebyreducing the time required to gather data or enlarging the aperture ofsensed data from moving or physically unstable targets.  Should oneUAV become disabled, the remaining vehicles can continue sensing,increasing the availability of the entire system to the mission, althoughpossibly at a reduced collection rate.Intelligent algorithms are presented that adapt the operation of thecomposite system to target dynamics.  The algorithms must maintain linkavailability among the colony of active ground sensors, reduce thegroundbased sensor data statistically to locate targets and identify theircharacteristics, form uplink beams from the groundbased sensors to thenearest UAVs passing overhead in the swarm, and guide the UAVs tocontinue sensing the active targets reported from the ground.  Moreover,the algorithms must also perform these tasks under the severe resourcelimitations of the groundbased sensor nodes on processing, memory,power, as well as number and types of onboard sensors.In this paper, network informationtheoretic metrics are applied to assessthe relative performance of these adaptive algorithms at published andplanned resource levels.  Simulations of mission scenarios based onpublished operating characteristics planned for ground sensors andUAVs are performed to establish the performance of the intelligentadaptive routines for the composite sensing network. In each scenario,the estimated network lifetime under static resource allocations iscomputed and the persistence periods of the target coverage for bothmobile and stationary targets are computed.656019, Session 5Genetic algorithm approach for adaptive power andsubcarrier allocation in multiuser OFDM systemsY. B. Reddy, Grambling State Univ. M. NaraghiPour, Louisiana StateUniv.Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM is a promisingtechnology for high data rate transmission in broadband wirelesssystems for its ability to mitigate the effects of frequency selectivechannel and combat intersymbol interference. Adaptive modulation cangreatly improve the system spectral efficiency by changing itsmodulation constellation and transmit power according to theinstantaneous channel state information. In frequency selective fadingchannels, the combination of OFDM and adaptive modulation can utilizethe merits of both technologies and has attracted a great deal of interestin recent years. In this paper a novel genetic algorithm application isproposed for adaptive power and subcarrier allocation in multiuserOFDM systems. To test the application, a simple genetic algorithm wasimplemented in MATLAB language. With the goal of minimizing theoverall transmit power while ensuring the fulfillment of each users rateand bit error rate BER requirement, the proposed algorithm acquires theneeded allocation through genetic search.The subcarrier allocation algorithm 3 was used to calculate the powerfor the population in each generation. The results show that the systemconverges after 20 generations with chromosome length 50. The resultsshow that data transfer is efficient in power requirement with allocationof more subcarriers to users 1, 2, 3. The simulations were tested forBER 0.1 to 0.00001, data rate of 256 bit per OFDM block andchromosome length 50. The results show that SNR converges after 30generations with improved performance compared to 3. We also testedthe convergence of the genetic algorithm through the method of adding20 individuals with good genes to the initial population for fasterconvergence and better results.References1.

Naqvi, Ctr. of Excellence in Information and CommunicationTechnologies Belgium M. Riguidel, cole Nationale Suprieure desTlcommunications FranceIntelligent complex systems are drawing considerable attention ofresearchers in various scientific areas. These architectures requireadequate assurances of security, reliability, and faulttolerance. Theimplementation of security functions such as identification,authentication, access control, and data protection can be viewed interms of a security assurance model. This model relies on the securityarchitecture of a system, which in turn is based on a trustedinfrastructure. This assurance model defines the level and features of theprotection it offers, and determines the need and relevance of thedeployment of specific security mechanisms.In this article, we first examine how the verification of the securitymeasures, and notably their presence, correctness, effectiveness, theimpact of changes in the existing intelligent complex systems withrespect to vulnerabilities, systems engineering choices, reconfigurations,patch installations, network management, etc. We then explore how wecan evaluate the overall security assurance of a given system. Weemphasis that it is desirable to separate the trust providing assurancemodel and the security architecture, into two separated distributedentities instrumentations, protocols, architectures, management. Webelieve that this segregation will allow us to automate and boost thetrusted infrastructure and security infrastructure, while the authorizations,exceptions, and security management as a whole, are achieved throughtheir interaction. Finally, we discuss the security metrics for thesecomplex intelligent systems. New mechanisms and tools are needed forassessing and proving the security and dependability of a complexsystem as the scale of these systems and the kind of threats andassumptions on their operational environment pose new challenges.

Matson, Wright State Univ. and Univ.of Cincinnati R. K. Bhatnagar, Univ. of CincinnatiIntelligent sensor networks are widely deployed in various applicationssuch as environmental monitoring, intrusion detection and traffic control.One common characteristic of all sensor networks is data streams arecontinuously sent from the individual sensors in the network. Thesestreams generate huge amounts of data which creates the opportunity tofind hidden patterns using data mining techniques.Sensor network data have several features that pose difficulty in directlyusing existing data mining algorithms. Data in the network are collectedand stored in a distributed manner, and each sensor scans andgenerates information about the environment continuously. Keeping alldata in the repository is not only costly, but also not necessary due to thedynamic nature of the environment. However, historical information canstill be useful in various ways. In summary, data from the sensornetworks are distributed, streamlined, and of large volume.We focus on two tasks in this paper, object classification and trajectoryprediction. The objective of this research is to apply distributed datamining techniques to stream data gained from the sensor networks. Ourmodel does not need to have a centralized site to compute the targetfunctionclassifier or prediction model. Each sensor performs localcomputation and sends some aggregate information to its neighbors.The global classifier then is built from the local computations andcommunication between the sensors. Our model also gives higherweights to readings that are more recent, while older readings are stillkept in the system but with smaller weights. By localizing thecomputation, our method provides better, more secure services.Localizing the computation also helps to reduce the powerconsumptions of the sensor networks.656022, Session 5Pattern classification on wireless sensor networksE.

K. Bhatnagar, K. Andra, Univ. of CincinnatiThe recent emergence of the sensor networks technology issignificantly impacting the capabilities for automated distributedmonitoring of environments. The large deployments of sensors for finegrained data gathering makes it practically infeasible to transport alldata to a central site for processing. Thus, effective localizedcommunication and computation mechanisms need to be designed.Aggregation trees covering complete terrains have been shown to be aneffective way of performing computation and communication in sensornetworks. In this paper we present a reactive approach to constructinglocalized aggregation trees, limited to the regions of activity, wherein thesensors within close proximity that sense some phenomenon constructa local aggregation tree for their localized computational use, send theconclusion to the base station, and then the tree structure may bediscarded. We have shown an application and simulation results todemonstrate the effectiveness of our suggested approach.656024, Session 6Fastvarying pitch tracking a new approach to speechmodelingD.

S. Lim, M. Z. Mat Jafri, K. Abdullah, K. L. Low, Univ. SainsMalaysia MalaysiaFor this study, an algorithm was developed to determine concentration ofparticles less than 10m PM10 still images captured by a CCTV cameraon the Penang Bridge. The objective of this study is to remotely monitorthe PM10 concentrations on the Penang Bridge through the internet. So,an algorithm was developed based on the relationship between theatmospheric reflectance and the corresponding air quality. By doing this,the still images were separated into three bands namely red, green andblue and their digital number values were determined. A specialtransformation was then performed to the data. Ground PM10measurements were taken by using DustTrakTM meter. The algorithmwas calibrated using a regression analysis. The proposed algorithmproduced a high correlation coefficient R and low rootmeansquareerror RMS between the measured and estimated PM10. Later, aprogram was written by using Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 to download stillimages from the camera over the internet and implement the newlydeveloped algorithm to it. Meanwhile, the program is running in real timeand the public will know the air pollution index from time to time. Thisindicates that the technique using the CCTV camera images can providea useful tool for air quality studies.656027, Session 7Automatic pattern recognition applied to thermal imagingfor largescale breast cancer detectionA.

Particularly we are applying IC to evaluate the variability oftruepositive and falsepositive cues by using a specialized proprietaryneural network Dynamic Perceptron architecture for the analysis of 2000prescreened  malignancies in a screening population.  Moreover, we areapplying the technique also to a sample data set of 2000 malignancieswith good infrared features but unreliable response to the infraredanalysis, due to imperfect techniques by the human operators. Finally,the same architecture is being tested also on an ongoing research onbreast cancer screening in hospital environment. Preliminary results arepresented and discussed also in relationship with other more classicaltechniques.656028, Session 7Evaluation of two key machine intelligence technologiesW. H. Land, Jr., G. J. Tomko, Binghamton Univ. J. J. Heine, H. LeeMoffitt Cancer Ctr.  Research Institute R. Thomas, A. Mizaku,Binghamton Univ.This paper will cover the application of a new technology, Kernel PartialLeast Squares KPLS configured as a learning system, as well as thebetter known Support Vector Machines SVMs to the computer aideddiagnosis CAD of Breast Cancer using mammogram screen film data.Using KPLS provides a new and powerful way of ascertaining nonlinearrelations using linear techniques appropriate for feature spacecomputations. Here, the algorithm designs are decoupled from featurespace specifications, which increases paradigm flexibility as well asresults in a more tractable learning algorithm design and kernelspecification formulation. KPLS runs in real time for data sets ofreasonable size, and does not require as many parameters as do SVMs.CAD beast cancer design trade offs will be discussed using severalSVM mapping kernels as well as various KPLS designs. The theory ofboth KPLS and SVMs will be summarized as well as the features of thescreen film mammogram dataset used. In addition, SVM sensitivityanalyses will be used to establish the most significant mammogramdataset discriminators and these findings compared with those obtainedwith the KPLS configurations.  Receiver Operating characteristic ROCcurve Az values as well as specificity , sensitivity and positive predictivevalue PPV measures  of performance will be used to quantify both SVMand KPLS classification and diagnostic performance.656029, Session 7Small mammographic lesions evaluation based on neuralgas networkA. MeyerBse, Florida State Univ.Biologicallymotivated novel neural networks represent an importantapproach in the analysis of complex patterns in signalintensity SItimeseries in dynamic breast MR imaging. They enable a subdifferentiation ofSItime courses within the lesion and thus reflect the lesion structure asconsisting of many different cell populations. The neuralgas neuralnetwork was applied to the detection of small lesions since it focusesstrictly on the observed complete MRI signal timeseries, and enables aselforganized datadriven segmentation of dynamic contrastenhancedbreast MRI timeseries w.r.t. finegrained differences of signal amplitude,and dynamics, such as focal enhancement in patients with indeterminatebreast lesions. As a result, we obtain both a set of prototypical timeseriesand a corresponding set of cluster assignment maps which furtherprovides a segmentation with regard to identification and regionalsubclassification of pathological breast tissue lesions. The achievedresults demonstrate an increase of accuracy predominantly in sensitivity.Sensitivity increased with biological neural network quantization in ductalcarcinoma in situ DCIS and lobular carcinoma. Specificity slightlydecreased in fibroadenomas and scars.656030, Session 7Performance evaluation of evolutionary computational andconventionally trained support vector machinesW. H. Land, Jr., Binghamton Univ. J. J. Heine, H. Lee Moffitt CancerCtr.  Research Institute D. Roye, D. Margols, Binghamton Univ.This paper describes a mutation process used in development of a familyof Support Vector Machines SVMs, trained by Evolutionary ProgrammingEP as well as  Evolutionary Strategies ES, for the diagnosis of breastcancer. This EP  ES hybrid was used to train a family of SVMs using anES mutation strategy designed to mimic gradient descent. Thismutation strategy was combined with the a rank order selection processas well as the tournament selection processes with and withoutreplacement of EP  to generate the family of  SVMs whose average andmaximum fitness increased, until reaching a maximum value, as thenumber of generations increased.  Several sensitivities experiments weredesigned and evaluated to optimize this process. The process utilizedboth random and bias mutation of several selfadaptive components. TheEP  derived SVMs provided an average receiver operating characteristicROC  Az value of about 0.925 using the five fold cross validationstatistical technique using a mammogram screen film data set. Thiscompares favorably with iteratively derived Az  SVM kernel results ofabout 0.9.  However, the important conclusion is that the evolutionaryprocess found SVM parameters that gave slightly more accurate resultsmuch quicker than an iterative or conventional method. Totalcomputational and interface time to obtain these slightly more accurateresults was reduced by a factor of about 80.Conf. 6560 Intelligent Computing Theory and Applications V208 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656031, Session 7Intelligent computing in breast cancer detectionP.

C. Roberts, D. Warnaar, A. Menozzi, S. Saadat, S. R. Snarski,Applied Research Associates, Inc.This paper describes an intelligent interior mapping capability thatgenerates high confidence maps of building interiors floor plans pluscritical features such as doorways, stairwells, windows, and ceilingheights rapidly with minimal interior exploration. Such a capabilitycould provide critical support to intelligence gathering andor life savingoperations in the military, law enforcement, disaster response, andcommercial sectors where rapid understanding of unknown interiorlayouts is required to save lives, maintain covertness, or minimize costs.The fundamental approach relies on an intelligent rulebasedinferencing process which requires a minimal set of structureobservables to generate high confidence interior layouts. The rules arebased on geospecific design practices and building codes. Theprocess considers known or suspected locations of structural elementsand generates a set of alternative layouts. It uses these locations andalternatives to determine the most probable layout and to provideconfidence levels for each component therein. This information is thenused to determine where to move next within the building so as tominimize the remaining layout uncertainty.This mapping capability has been demonstrated experimentally on arepresentative UGV platform. The platform maps its surroundings usinga suite of onboard environmental imaging sensors rangefinders, a 3DLidar camera, sonar sensors and associated sensor fusion algorithms.Although demonstrated as part of a UGV platform, it is envisioned thatthis intelligent mapping capability could be extended to humanbornesoldier, police officer, urban search and rescue personnel systems orto low altitude UAVs for 3D mapping of building exteriors in denseurban environments.656102, Session 1Negative obstacle detection for offroad autonomousnavigationA. L. Rankin, A. Huertas, L. H. Matthies, Jet Propulsion Lab.Detecting negative obstacles ditches, holes, washouts, and otherdepressions is one of the most difficult problems in perception forunmanned ground vehicle UGV offroad autonomous navigation.  Onereason for this is that the width of the visible portion of a negativeobstacle may only span a few pixels at the stopping distance for vehiclespeeds most UGV programs aspire to operate at 20mph.  Theproblem can be further compounded when negative obstacles areobscured by vegetation or when negative obstacles are embedded inundulating terrain.  Because of the variety of appearances of negativeobstacles, a multicue detection approach is desired.  In previousnighttime negative obstacle detection work, we have describedcombining geometry based cues from stereo range data and heatsignature based cues from thermal infrared imagery.  Heat signature is apowerful cue during the night since the interiors of negative obstaclesgenerally remain warmer than surrounding terrain throughout the night.In this paper, we further couple thermal and geometry based cues fornighttime negative obstacle detection.  Edge detection is used togenerate closed contour candidate negative obstacle regions that aregeometrically filtered to determine if they lie within the ground plane.Cues for negative obstacles from heat signature, geometrybasedanalysis of range images, and geometrybased analysis of terrain mapsare fused.  The focus of this work is to increase the range at whichUGVs can reliably detect negative obstacles on crosscountry terrain,thereby increasing the speed at which UGVs can safely operate.656103, Session 1Onthemove independently moving target detectionG. Salgian, J. Xiao, S. Samarasekera, R. Kumar, Sarnoff Corp.Military vehicles operating in an urban environment are exposed tonumerous threats from all directions. Distributed aperture camerasystems provide the ability for a vehicle crew to have continuous,closedhatch 360degree situational awareness of the immediatesurroundings prior to dismount and while on the move. However, it isdifficult for an operator to simultaneously monitor the entire sensorarray.This paper describes a system for automatically detecting potentialtargets that popup or move into view and to cue the operator topotential threats. Detection of independently moving targets from amoving ground vehicle is challenging due to the strong parallax effectse.g. occlusion caused by the camera motion close to the 3D structurein the environment. We present a 3D approach to effectively resolve thisambiguity and detect and track such independently moving targets withmultiple monocular cameras. In our approach, we first recover thecamera position and orientation by employing a visual odometrymethod. Next, using multiple consecutive frames with the estimatedcamera poses, the structure of the scene at the reference frame isexplicitly recovered by a motion stereo approach, and correspondingoptical flow fields between the reference frame and other frames arealso estimated. Third, an advanced filter is designed by combiningsecond order differences between 3D warping and optical flow warpingto distinguish the moving object from parallax regions.We present results of the algorithm on data collected with an eightcamera system mounted on a vehicle under multiple scenarios thatinclude moving and popup targets.656104, Session 1The Army Research Laboratory ARL synchronousimpulse reconstruction SIRE forward looking radarM. A. Ressler, L. H. Nguyen, F. Koenig, D. C. Wong, G. D. Smith,Army Research Lab.The Army Research Laboratory ARL has designed and fabricated aforwardlooking, impulsebased, ultrawideband UWB imaging radarfor detection of concealed targets. This proofofconcept radar systememploys a physical array of 16 receive antennas to provide thenecessary aperture for sufficient crossrange resolution in the forwardlooking geometry. Each antenna feeds a baseband receiverdigitizerthat integrates the data from a number of radar pulses before passing iton to the personal computer PC based operators console and display.The innovative ARL receiver design uses commercially availableintegrated circuits to provide a lowcost, lightweight digitizing schemewith an effective sampling rate of approximately 8 GHz. The design isextensible to allow for growth in the number of channels used andimprovements in integrated circuit performance to eventually meet theexpected unmanned ground vehicle combat pace. Using modulesbased on COTS components allows for continued expansion ofcapabilities of the system based on increasing capabilities of thesecomponents.Downrange resolution is provided by the bandwidth of the transmittedpulse which occupies 3003000 MHz. Range coverage is designed tobe 25 meters with an adjustable start point forward of the vehicle.Modeling studies have shown that a pair of transmitters situated at thetwo ends of the receive array provides best performance in crossrangeresolution. Image processing is done with a back projection algorithmthat allows a quick look at the scene ahead. However, radar data iscontinuously collected so that a horizontal twodimensional syntheticaperture is formed for 3D image formation. This allows focusing of thedata to yield estimates of target height as well as position to tagpotential obstacles as being negative e.g. holes, ditches or positivee.g. tree stumps.210 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssInitial testing of the radar system will be done using a Ford Expedition asthe mobile platform. The vehicle has an onboard 110 VAC inverter systemthat can be operated from batteries if needed and an antenna supportstructure that will allow positioning the antenna at various locations withrespect to the roof and front of the vehicle. Integrated radar data from all16 channels is collected and stored onboard the PC system with 3Dfocusing of the data taking place offline.

J. Rigas, B. A. Bodt, J. A. Bornstein, Army Research Lab.The Armys family of Unmanned Ground Vehicle UGV platforms for theFuture Combat Systems FCS is currently being developed to supportmounted and dismounted troop operations within the Unit of Action UA.In accomplishing their missions, it is necessary for UGVs to operate incomplex and hostile environments.  UGVs must reliably, consistently, andsafely sense and respond to objects that are typically encountered bymanned vehicles such as other moving vehicles and humans.ARL is developing the autonomous capability to directly support the ArmysFCS program.  The purpose of this paper is to document and benchmarkthe current ARL Collaborative Technology Alliance CTA capabilities indetecting, tracking and avoiding moving objects.  For this experiment ARLand GDRS conducted a series of trials involving an ARL eXperimentalUnmanned Vehicle XUV operating in proximity to a number of movingmannequins and vehicles.The experimentation was divided into two portions.  The first portionexamined the performance of a number of algorithms using a series ofsensor modalities to detect moving objects, i.e., people and vehicles, froma moving platform.  The second portion of the experiment focused on theability of the dynamic planner to utilize detection data in order to planappropriate routes that will avoid moving pedestrians and vehicles.  Thisanalysis was conducted in simulation using input data obtained from asubset of the detection data that includes the best performing algorithmsfrom the first part of the experiment.656106, Session 1A new SMART sensing systemD. C. Zhang, P. Yu, P. Qing, S. J.

Zhu, T. Oskiper, O. Naroditsky, S. Samarasekera, H. S. Sawhney, R.Kumar, Sarnoff Corp.Traditional visionbased navigation system utilizing only one pair of stereocamera often drifts over time. In this paper, we propose a set of techniquesto improve the robustness and accuracy of visual navigation systems.First, two pairs of stereo cameras are integrated to form a forwardbackward multistereo camera system. As a result, the FieldOfView ofthe system is extended significantly to capture more natural landmarksfrom the scene, which gives great robustness in challenging conditionssuch as when there are many confusers and other moving objects in thescene occluding one or more cameras or when there is lack of imagetexture in portions of the scene. Second, a global landmark matchingtechnique is proposed to recognize the previously visited locationsduring navigation. The landmarks are automatically detected andplaced in a 3D geospatial database. A pose correction technique isactivated to reduce drift errors accumulated in the navigation positionby matching to previously detected landmarks. Finally, in order tofurther improve the robustness of the system under certain specialscenes without rich textures, both IMU and GPS sensors are integratedwith the visual odometry system within an extended Kalman filteringframework to prevent the possible failures due to the lack of naturallandmarks. Using these techniques, the developed system issignificantly more accurate and robust over longdistance navigationboth indoors and outdoors. Real navigation tasks demonstrate that weare able to locate the user within 1 meter in an unknown GPS deniedenvironments during navigation tasks over 500 meters long.656108, Session 1Angularly sensitive microsensor construction and newprocessing paradigmJ. B. Franck, U.S. Army Night Vision  Electronic SensorsDirectorateDiscussed is a novel method of manufacturing1 an Angularly SensitiveMicroSensor ASMS.  The process employed utilizes excimer laserablation to write out the microlens on the curved surface of the masterlens.  This master lens element is manufactured with fused opticalfibers, such that if the registration is maintained, the light from eachmicrolens goes via the fiber to a specific pixel.  If local imaging isrequired for specific tasks the fiber can send the angularly localizedimage to a pixel set.  Image fusing may then be required.Infrared and ultraviolet versions can be manufactured.  A more generalapplication allows for a multspectral sensor.  After one ASMS isconstructed, then an inverse mask mould can be created and themonolithic sphere, retaining its registration, is covered in liquid plasticand placed into the mould and the exact replica is recreated.  Theadvantage is low cost and rapid manufacture of the ASMS.  Animportant aspect of this approach is that the sensor samples amplitudeand angular space rather than amplitude and position space asconventional sensors currently do.  This makes the ASMS processingparadigm completely different from conventional image processing.  Forexample using several fiberpixel elements to comprise a UVpolarimeter allows for simple storage and processing of vector elementsfor simple navigation.  The home position may be treated as Look uptable reference matrix RM.  That base table can be modified toaccount for the passage of time and hence change in solar positionfrom the UV polarimeter, as appropriate.  A second real time travelmatrix TRM is then created.  Eventually, a target matrix TAM wouldalso be created.  Simply driving changes in the TRM towards the RMwould be used for navigating the return trip back to home base.  Whenthe difference between the two matrices goes to a null matrix theplatform would be home.1.

The system identifies a set ofimage chips or exemplars in the training images that span the range ofterrain appearance.  Exemplar statistical quantities are used to measurechip differences.

The system uses the exemplars to segment novel imagesand assigns an appropriate feature vector tag to them.

The system provides online prediction of vehicleperformance on upcoming terrain.656110, Session 1Daredevil ultrawideband radar sensing for small UGVsB. M. Yamauchi, iRobot Corp.For the TARDECfunded Daredevil Project, iRobot is integratinginexpensive, lowpower, ultra wideband radar sensors with higherresolution range sensors LIDAR, stereo vision to provide sensing forsmall UGVs.  The key objectives are to develop sensor configurationsand processing algorithms to enable the system to reliably detectobstacles through foliage and through rain and snow.  A unique featureof our approach is the use of polarimetric radar to distinguish foliagefrom solid objects.  Common types of foliage tall grass, open fields,crop fields provide strong radar returns for verticallypolarized radarpulses and weak radar returns for horizontallypolarized radar pulses.  Incontrast, objects such as rocks reflect radar roughly equally regardlessof pulse orientation.   By computing the differential reflectivity of thetarget object, we expect to reliably distinguish verticallyorientedvegetation from other solid objects.  In this paper, we will describecurrent results from realworld experiments using polarimetric radar toperceive solid obstacles through foliage, rain, and snow.656111, Session 1NonGPS navigation with the personal deadreckoningsystemL. V. Ojeda, J. Borenstein, Univ. of MichiganThis paper presents our recently developed Personal DeadreckoningPDR system for walking persons. The system uses a 6DOF inertialmeasurement unit IMU attached to the users shoe. The IMU providesrate and acceleration measurements that are used to estimate thelocation of the user in realtime. The core principle of our system is atechnique known as Zero Velocity Updates ZUPTS, which allows forthe correction of errors due to drift in the accelerometers of the IMU.Accelerometer drift is the most significant error in a system like ours,and the successful correction of such errors is the key to successfuldeadreckoning.Using ZUPTS and additional mathematic techniques, the overall error ofour PDR system has been consistently less than 2 of distancetraveled, independent of the users walking gait or speed. Our systemworks just as well on sloped terrain or stairs as it does on flat terrain. Onnonflat terrain the PDR system also estimates the vertical position ofthe user, although with larger errors than 2 of distance traveled.Since IMUs do not require any external beacons or signals, our systemis usable in any environment, without any preparation. Of particularinterest are GPSdenied environments such as inside buildings, tunnels,urban canyons, or under dense foliage. Our system is useful for firstresponders and military or security personnel.The paper here describes the PDR system briefly and then focuses onextensive experimental results and field testing.656112, Session 1A novel routing and sensor control optimization algorithmfor target search and classificationG. E. Collins, Toyon Research Corp. J. Riehl, Univ. of CaliforniaSanta Barbara P. E. Vegdahl, Toyon Research Corp.Two typical problems in unmanned air vehicle UAV and sensor controlare locating targets in minimum time, and classifying targets withmaximum certainty. Current methods solve the optimization of UAVrouting control and sensor management independently. While thisdecoupled approach makes the target search problem computationallytractable, it is suboptimal.In this paper, we explore the target search and classification problemsby formulating and solving a joint UAV routing and sensor controloptimization problem. The routing problem is solved on a graph usingreceding horizon optimal control. The objective function for the routingoptimization is in turn the solution of a sensor control optimizationproblem. In particular, an optimal sensor schedule in the sense ofmaximizing the viewed target probability mass or minimizing theShannon entropy is constructed for each candidate flight path in therouting control problem.The probability distribution function pdf of the target state isrepresented with a particle filter and an occupancy map for anyundiscovered targets. The tradeoff between searching for undiscoveredtargets and locating tracks is handled automatically and dynamically bythe use of an appropriate objective function. In particular, the objectivefunction is based on the expected amount of target probability mass tobe viewed. In the target classification problem, one needs to considerthe existence of multiple target types simultaneously. In this case, weuse an objective function based on  Shannon entropy. Again, thetradeoff between searching for undiscovered targets and classifyingexisting tracks is handled automatically and dynamically.656113, Session 2Intelligent unmanned vehicle systems suitable forindividual and cooperative missionsM.

While Cohort is predominatelya Horizon III project that delivers technology in the 20 year time frame.,current operational realities are placing ever greater urgency to fieldeffective unmanned vehicles and systems.Unmanned vehicle systems have been an attractive technology for themilitary, but whose promises have remained largely undelivered. Thereare fielded remote controlled UGVs and high altitude UAV whosebenefits are based on standoff in low complexity environments with lowreaction time requirements.  While effective within there limitedoperational niche such systems do not meet with the vision of futuremilitary UxV scenarios.  There are clearly gaps in the critical sciencerequired to move unmanned systems from sluggish drones that are aburden to employ to the agile and information savvy systems required.This paper will discuss the critical science being addressed by Cohort,through DRDC research, academic, industry and internationalpartnerships. Critical science includes1. Real World Learning Learning UxVs is required not only to adapt tothe irregularities and inconsistencies of the real environments, but toautonomously generate solutions to problems and refine thosesolutions with increasing experience.  Learning will play major roles insensor interpretation, planning, control, action and multivehiclecoordination.2. Self Defining Perceptual Abstractions. The reduction of sensor datavision, tactile, proprioceptive .. to useful and relevant abstractions isdone using a priori knowledge and human insight into the utility andneeds of the vehiclemission and knowledge as to what are goodindicator features in the sensation stream.  For broadly applicablevehicle intelligence these abstractions need to be determined duringoperation by the vehicle and be based upon each vehicles individualcapabilities and changing needs.3. Planning and Coordination with Complex and Acquired ActionEffectsCost models  Current single and multivehicle mission plannersrequire a priori defined actioneffectcost models. These models arehandcrafted and only possible with known and easy to define effectssuch as spatial location and vehicle movement costs.  Effectiveplanning systems must be able to acquire and use models of complexreal vehicle  world interactions well beyond simplistic models must bedeveloped.4. Distributed Centralized Control Coordination of vehicle iscommunication and information impoverished situation will require atolerance to isolation and ignorance.  Advances in distributed controland distributed planning are required to insure operation in theseconditions. On board UxV intelligence will need to make decisions oncoordination and planning paradigms they operate under and when toswitch.5. C2 and Interfaces The C2 system must be flexible to accommodatediverse capabilities of many types of UxVs and a broad range ofmissions and extensible to accommodate new and self generatedintelligent and capabilities. New interfaces must be developed for highlyindependent UxVs and support transfer of knowledge via learningtraining between humans and machines and informal direction fromhumans.656116, Session 2Establishment of a center for defense roboticsD.

Ruedin, Science Applications International Corp. M. R.Perschbacher, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency J. E.Bares, Carnegie Mellon Univ.As Unmanned Ground Vehicle technology matures and newer andlarger UGVs are developed for a variety of applications, their operationamong humans will grow.  Current UGVs are operated safely in thepresence of humans by implementing one or more of the followingrestrictions a the system is small enough or slow enough that itskinetic energy presents only a minor hazard to humans if contact ismade, b the system is operated at slow enough speeds that anyhumans nearby have plenty of time to avoid it, c humans are requiredto remain outside a certain radius with respect to the vehicle andmonitor the UGVs activity when it is on, d the UGV avoids all objectswithin a certain radius and stops if any object is detected within asmaller but still large radius to insure it stays away from humans.  Toincrease the utility of UGVs for tasks where one would like to havehumans and robots operating in close proximity, one must find aparadigm that is improved over d to reduce the burden on humans formonitoring and avoiding their UGV partners.  This paper describes initialexperiments conducted to collect data needed for evaluation of thedetection performance of a Ladar and camera sensor suite forstationary and moving humans from a large stationary and moving UGV.Of importance here, is not the actual performance of the sensors whichwill evolve over time, but the method used to insure that the test itselfcan be conducted safely.  The paper describes how the tests wereplanned and how simulations can be used to enhance preparation forexperiments of this type.656118, Session 3Objective test and performance measurement ofautomtotive crash warning systemsS.

Merchant, RPU Technology F. Pope, Kanasaska Technology, LLCA BioInspired Collision Avoidance System BICAS is described thatderives range images from the output of a conventional camera as itmoves relative to the scene.  The range images from BICAS, installedon a micro UAV, can warn of looming collisions and help determine asafe evasive maneuver. This will reduce operator workload and maypreserve the vehicle during a temporary loss of the video link to theground station controller. A range image of the scene may be essentialfor semiautonomous or autonomous operation. The range image isderived by tracking the rangedependent displacement of scene detailover a sequence of camera images. The effect of any rotation of thecamera, or of any change in the direction of its velocity vector duringthe sequence, is removed using information from an IMU. The motion ofscene detail is then along a known set of optic flow lines, and itsdisplacement can be measured by simple onedimensional tracking.BICAS is bioinspired by its use of a new low density image samplingprotocol variance sampling, derived from human vision. Variancesampling captures high spatial frequency information as needed forexample to sense power lines in spite of its low pixel density.  A massof irrelevant pointbypoint detail is eliminated that greatly simplifies thetracking task and reduces the processing load.656121, Session 3Layeredmode selection logic control with fuzzy sensorfusion networkT. E. Born, A. B. Wright, Univ. of ArkansasLittle RockRobots developed from the 60s to the present have been restricted tohighly structured environments such as work cells or automated guidedvehicles, primarily to avoid harmful interactions with humans. Nextgeneration robots must function in unstructured environments. Suchrobots must be fault tolerant to sensor and manipulator failures,scalable in number of agents, and adaptable to different robotic baseplatforms.  The Central Arkansas Robotics Consortium has developed arobot controller architecture, called Layered Mode Selection LogicLMSL, which addresses all of these concerns.  The LMSL architectureis an implementation of a behavior based controller fused with aplanner. The architecture creates an abstraction layer for the robotsensors through a Fuzzy Sensor Fusion Network FSFN, and it createsan abstraction layer for the robot manipulators through a reactive layer.The LMSL architecture has been implemented and tested on the J5robotics research platform.  A FSFN combines acceleration and forcesignals for collision detection. The output of the FSFN switches amonglow level behaviors to accomplish obstacle avoidance and obstaclemanipulation. Comparable results are achieved with all sensorsfunctioning, with only the acceleration sensor force sensor faulted, andwith only the force sensor acceleration sensor faulted.  In this paper,results for the J5 robotics research platform are presented.656122, Session 3Effect of collision avoidance for autonomous robot teamformationM. Seidman, S. J. Yang, Rochester Institute of TechnologyTechnological advances have allowed for the creation of cost effectiveyet highly mobile and precise moving robots that are capable of sensingand communication. These robots may cooperate to perform tasksnever achievable by a single robot. A robot team formation problem isone that seeks autonomous actions taken by individual robots so as toform into a geographical shape with limited knowledge and with noreference point. A typical shape considered in the literature is a circle ornpolygon, where n is the number of robots forming the shape. Forminginto a circle may be considered as a starting point for the robot team toperform a cooperative task. Applications of cooperative robot teamsinclude intruder detection and containment of chemical spills or forestfires.  Existing work on robot team formation focuses on theoreticalanalysis where realworld factors, such as the size of the robots, are notconsidered. It is unclear whether proposed theoretical algorithms arevalid or perform well in realworld settings.This research reviews and selects an autonomous robot shapeformation algorithm that doesnt require global sensing, and examinesthe effect of different sensing and collision avoidance technologies onthe performance of the algorithm.  Three different collision avoidancescenarios are presented and analyzed when accounting for the robotsizes.  The three scenarios represent increasing sensing andcommunication capabilities required for the costeffective autonomousrobots.  The performances of the original algorithm, which doesntaccount for collisions, and that achieved by the same ideal algorithmwith the three collision avoidance scenarios are compared.   Our resultssuggest that adding communication does not necessarily enhance thesuccess rate and the convergence speed of shape formation as long asthe robots are capable of detecting and avoiding imminent collisions.Moreover, in the case where only limited robots are available, it is thecollision avoidance that relies on conservative yet complex algorithmicapproaches outperforms robots with advance sensing andcommunication.656123, Session 3Toward safe navigation in urban environmentC. Ye, Univ. of ArkansasLittle RockThis paper presents a method for autonomous navigation of a mobilerobot in urban environment. An urban environment is defined as onehaving hard surface and comprising curbs, ramps and obstacles. Therobot is required to move on the flat ground or ramps but avoid curbsand obstacles. To guide the robot in an urban environment, a 3D terrainmap is needed. In this paper, a 2D laser rangefinder Sick LMS 200 isused for 3D terrain mapping because it has a long range capability andhas accurate range measurement. The terrain mapping system uses asingle sensor modality and is therefore affordable. However, it issusceptible to erroneous sensory data mixed pixels and random noise.In the authors previous work 1, a filtering method based on theelevation and certainty information of cells in a gridtype map wasproposed to remove the erroneous laser range data. The filteringmethod incurs computational cost and its performance may bedegraded when the robot turns quickly. In this paper, an alternativemixed pixel removal method is proposed. It uses the distinctive physicalfeatures of mixed pixels  the discontinuities in intensity and rangemeasurement. Differing from the intensity discontinuity of other laserrangefinders, the Sick LMS 200s intensity value increases abruptly at acorner shot a mixed pixel, i. e. the intensity value of a mixed pixel ismuch bigger than those of its neighboring measurements at the frontobject and the background object. This property together with thediscontinuity of range measurement can be used as the signature of amixed pixel and used to remove mixed pixels.An Extended Terrain Map ETM is built using the filtered laser scandata. Each ETM consists of a regular elevation map and a socalledcertainty map where each cell holds a value representing theconfidence of the elevation information of the corresponding cell in theelevation map. When building the certainty map the motion continuityconstraint 1 is used to update each cell. Therefore, a cell corrupted byrandom noise has relatively smaller certainty, and the error can beremoved by simply using a median filter. The certainty information canalso be used to enhance the robustness of the navigation method. Foran example, cells in an unperceived area usually have zero certaintyvalue and must be treated as untraversable. This prevents the robotfrom falling off an elevated area. A local obstacle negotiation method,called Traversability Field Histogram 2, is then used to determine therobot motion. The method first transforms a local terrain map into atraversability map, and then transforms the traversability map into aTraversabiliy Field Histogram TFH. Each value in the TFH representsthe overall difficulty traversing the corresponding direction. As therobots heading yaw angle is taken into account when computing thetraversability index of each cell, the TFH algorithm allows the robot tosnake through a steep slope. The local convergence property of theTFH algorithm is proven in this paper.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX214 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656124, Session 3Simulating and testing autonomous behavior in multipleairborne sensor systemsM. I. Smith, Waterfall Solutions Ltd. United Kingdom M. L.Hernandez, M. Cooper, QinetiQ Ltd. United KingdomThe Multiple Airborne Sensor Targeting and Evaluation Rig MASTER isa high fidelity simulation environment in which data fusion, tracking andsensor management algorithms developed within QinetiQ Ltd. can bedemonstrated and evaluated. In this paper we report an observertrajectory planning tool that adds functionality to MASTER. Thistrajectory planning tool controls each sensor by applying instantaneousthrusts, the magnitude of which is chosen to gain maximumobservability of the target. The target itself has the capability of beingevasive, and can switch between a constant velocity model and anumber of quantised acceleration models of varying magnitude. Weuse an efficient search technique to determine the thrust that should beapplied to each platform at each time step, and the planning horizoncan be either onestep greedy or twostep. The measure ofperformance used in evaluating each potential sensor manoeuvrethrust is the posterior CramerRao lower bound PCRLB, which givesbest possible lowest mean square error tracking performance. In thispaper we exploit a recent novel approach to approximating the PCRLBfor manoeuvring target tracking Hernandez et al., 2005. The basis ofthis technique is to replace the multimodal target probability densityfunction with a bestfitting Gaussian BFG distribution. In a recentpaper, this approach was shown give an accurate measure ofperformance that closely matches stateoftheart filter performance.Furthermore, a closedform expression gives the BFG approximation ateach sampling time. Hence, the PCRLB can be approximated with avery low computational overhead, and therefore implemented in timecritical scenarios.656125, Session 4Supervised autonomy for robotic inspectionK. L. Moore, Colorado School of MinesExperience deploying robots for security and inspection tasks  showsthat  often the activity of driving the robot interferes with the activity ofobserving the sensor data often visual collected by the robot. It hasbeen  suggested that the supervised autonomy paradigm can improvedsystem performance. In this approach, some aspects of the robotsactions are automated, particularly motion control, freeing the operatorto focus on the inspection task. In this paper we describe thedevelopment and implementation of a semiautonomous mode for theODIS robot, whereby, under the direction and supervision of anoperator, the robot can selfnavigate underneath automobiles and othervehicles, sending back video images for operator inspection. Theoperational concept is as follows in manual mode robot is teleoperated by the operator visually or by navigating with the robotscamera to the driverside front wheel of the vehicle to be inspected.Then, using its inspection camera, the robot visually localizes itself tothe vehicle to be inspected and from that localization, computes anddrives an inspection path under the vehicle. Experimental results showthe effectiveness of the approach, including improvements in inspectiontime and performance that are possible using supervised autonomy.656126, Session 4Integration of an intelligent systems behavior simulatorand a scalable soldiermachine interfaceT. G. Johnson, DCS Corp. T. M. Tierney, U.S. Army TARDECRDECOMAs the Armys Future Combat Systems FCS introduce emergingtechnologies and new force structures to the battlefield, soldiers willincreasingly face new challenges in workload management. The nextgeneration warfighter will be responsible for effectively managingrobotic assets in addition to performing their primary mission.  Studiesof future battlefield operational scenarios involving the use ofautomation, including the specification of existing and proposedtechnologies, will provide significant insight into potential problem areasregarding soldier workload.The US Army Tank Automotive Research, Development, andEngineering Center TARDEC is currently executing an Army technologyobjective program to analyze and evaluate the effect of automatedtechnologies and their associated control devices with respect tosoldier workload. The HumanRobotic Interface HRI IntelligentSystems Behavior Simulator ISBS is a human performancemeasurement simulation system that allows modelers to developconstructive simulations of military scenarios with various deploymentsof interface technologies in order to evaluate operator effectiveness.One such interface is TARDECs Scalable SoldierMachine InterfaceSMI. The scalable SMI provides a configurable machine interfaceapplication that is capable of adapting to several hardware platforms byrecognizing the physical space limitations of the display device.This paper describes the integration of the ISBS and Scalable SMIapplications, which will ultimately benefit both systems. The ISBS willbe able to use the Scalable SMI to visualize the behaviors of virtualsoldiers performing HRI tasks, such as route planning, and the scalableSMI will benefit from stimuli provided by the ISBS simulationenvironment. The paper describes the background of each system anddetails of the system integration approach.656127, Session 4Augmented teleoperation for soldierrobot checkpointinspection systems, phase I test resultsG. Witus, Turing Associates, Inc. R. E. Karlsen, G. R. Gerhart, U.S.Army TARDECRDECOMSmall teleoperated mobile robots are beginning to be used incheckpoint operations.  Troops can conduct the initial inspection from aremote location, safe from potential sniper fire and car bombdetonation.  Visual inspection is currently the primary initial screeningprocedure.  Handheld sensors capable of detecting explosives,chemicalbiological threats, and objects concealed in hollowcompartments are also beginning to be used in the field.  The logicalnext step is to deploy these sensors on the robots.  However thesensors must be positioned close to the suspected trace, vapor source,or compartment.  Teleoperation is fatiguing and stressful even withoutthe requirement for close positioning.  The TARDEC Robotic MobilityLaboratory TRML is investigating approaches to reduce workload andimprove performance through augmented teleoperation.This paper reports on the results of preliminary experiments to assessthe relative effectiveness of 3 degreeoffreedom DoF versus 2 DoFmotion control, onboard egocentric viewing perspective versusoverwatch perspective, and a distance and orientation visual cueingsystem.  Three DoF motion control rotation and omnidirectionaltranslation produced substantially shorter response times than 2 DoFmotion control.  Laser cueing significantly reduced positioning errorswithout affecting response time for both 2 DoF and 3 DoF control.  Inthe absence of laser cuing, 3 DoF motion control reduced positioningerrors relative to 2 DoF control, but had only a small effect in thepresence of laser cueing.  Viewing perspective had small andinconsistent effects on response time and components of spatial error.656128, Session 4Results from a longterm study of portable field robot inurban terrainC. Lundberg, Kungliga Tekniska Hgskolan Sweden and NationalDefence College Sweden R. Reinhold, H. I. Christensen, KungligaTekniska Hgskolan SwedenMilitary possesses a considerable amount of experience from usingrobots for mine clearing and bomb removal. But as new technologyemerges it is also necessary to investigate the possibly to expand robotuse to further remove soldiers from risk, to perform more efficiently or atlower cost and to enable missions unsuited to humans. In theevaluation process the profits of robots have to be valued against costsfor acquisition, integration, training, maintenance as well as missionefficiency and reliability.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 215This study has investigated an Army company specialized in urbanoperations while solving their tasks with the support of a PackBotScout. The robot was integrated and deployed as an ordinarycomponent of the company, which included modifying and retraining anumber of standard behaviors to include the robot. The reported resultswere acquired under a longterm test ranging over a period of sixmonths during which the company participated in training maneuverswith 200 to 6000 soldiers.The results show that the implemented robot may well be of value butonly in specific situations. The robot cannot simply take the place of asoldier. Most commonly was the robot used for exploration insidebuilding while no obvious enemy threat or time pressure was prevailing.It was found that the users needed to have precise knowledge of thesystems performance to rightfully decide in which cases to deploy therobot.  For example, performing exploration with the robot would atleast take twice the time of traditional methods but may well entail afaster mission realization as a result of information increase. Thesoldiers also needed to thoroughly train the new schemes, which wererequired for integration of the robot in their activities. Finally, the studypointed out what technical properties that constrain the system andwhat new abilities would be of most value.656129, Session 4Layered augmented virtualityG. Ahuja, B. Sights, G. T. Kogut, E. B. Pacis, H. R. Everett, F.Birchmore, Space and Naval Warfare Systems Ctr., San DiegoAdvancements to robotic platform capabilities and autonomy make itnecessary to enhance the current capabilities of the OCU for betterperception of the information provided by the robot.   Augmentedvirtuality is one technique used to improve the user interface,augmenting a virtualworld representation with information from onboard sensors and human input.  Standard techniques for displayinginformation, such as embedding information icons from sensorpayloads and external systems other robots, could result in seriousinformation overload, making it difficult to sort out the relevant aspectsof the tactical picture. This paper illustrates a unique layered approachto augmented virtuality that specifically addresses this need for optimalsituation awareness.  We describe the efforts to implement three displaylayers that sort the information based on the component, platform, andmission needs.  Two gatheringsharing layers are also investigated as ameans to contribute to one common operating picture between multiplerobots and operators.656130, Session 4Layered autonomous overwatch the necessity andfeasability of multiple unmanned systems in combatsupportS. P. Monckton, Defence Research and Development CanadaCanadaUnmanned systems simultaneously reduce risk and magnify the impactof soldieroperators. For example, in Afghanistan UAVs routinely provideoverwatch to manned units while UGVs support IED identification anddisposal roles. Expanding these roles requires greater autonomy with acoherent unmanned system of systems approach that leverages oneplatforms strengths against the weakness of another. Thoughteleoperation makes unmanned systems useful today, expandingunmanned systems adoption will require substantially greater autonomyto reduce operator work loads. Together ground, fixed and rotor wingUVs may provide an important mixture of range, speed, payload, andendurance to provide services ranging from comms rebroadcast,medium range reconnaissance, highspeed lowaltitude routeinspection, largepayload route clearing. This paper explores theunmanned system strengths and weaknesses in specific combatsupport roles and examines composite joint FixedRotorGroundsystems as a solution.656131, Session 4Headaimed remote vision for EOD robotsK. Massey, Chatten Associates, Inc.Several different typical Explosive Ordnance Disposal missions werestudied using current vision systems and a newly developed HeadAimedRemote Vision HARV system. Tasks included looking for hiddensecondary Improvised Explosive Devices IEDs while the EOD robot ismoving downrange to investigate a known IED location. The night visioncapability of the HARV system was also studied, including a missionperformance comparison of a thermal imager 320 x 240 microbolometerversus a lowlight camera 0.00005 lux nearIR. All simulated missionswere performed by experienced Army EOD soldiers in a realistic setting.Impact of vision system on mission performance is presented.656132, Session 4An agentbased approach to decluttering the interfaces ofmultiUAV command and control systemsS. OHara, N. Dwyer, 21st Century Systems, Inc.Information overload and cluttered user interfaces can lead to decreasedsituational awareness and lowered performance of human operators.Irrelevant data increases searching times for tasks requiring theidentification of threats, causing delayed decisions. Cognitive burden onthe user increases as displays become more cluttered, which results inincreased operator stress leading to poor decisionmaking ability.To address this issue, we have proposed an intelligent agentbasedsystem for the automatic decluttering of a representative netcentricinterface designed for controlling multiple unmanned aerial vehiclesUAVs by a single operator. Our concept is called ARID, for AgentbasedReduction of Information Density. The ARID hypothesis is that intelligentagents can improve operator performance by deemphasizing thoseaspects of a display that can be inferred as lessimportant to the missiongoals.The ARID agent receives information about the world via data feedsprovided by various netcentric sources. The agent has an understandingof the user interface symbols that are used to represent various entities,terrain features, and zones. The agent also is provided with a missiongoal which is used for inferring the relevance of a given symbol to thesuccess of the mission goal. First level facts, such as spatialrelationships, are calculated by monitoring agents and assigned a BDUbeliefdisbeliefuncertainty value. A dynamic set of rules provides aninference mechanism by which an agent can infer new facts from thegiven assertions. We have developed a forwardchaining reasoner thatexplicitly deals with belief and uncertainty in the knowledge base, and isused to derive a relevancy belief for every UI symbol in the map display.Subjective Logic is used to combine values when different rules providedifferent results for the same symbol. The user interface of the display isprogrammed to alter the opacity of the symbol based upon the currentrelevancy BDU value at each tick of the simulation. More relevantsymbols are more opaque, and less relevant ones are more transparent.Our paper discusses the development of an initial knowledgerepresentation of the problem domain and user interface elements, thedesign of the ARID agents and reasoning engine, and the evaluation of atestbed implementation. We conclude with experimental evidence todemonstrate the effectiveness of the system.656133, Session 4Stereovision based 3D modeling for unmanned groundvehiclesS. Se, P. Jasiobedzki, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates Ltd.CanadaInstant Scene Modeler iSM is a system capable of generating calibratedphotorealistic 3D models of unknown environments quickly using stereoimage sequences.  Equipped with iSM, unmanned ground vehiclesUGVs can capture stereo images and create 3D models to send back tothe base station while they explore unknown environments.

The photorealism of the models enhancesthe situational awareness of the mission and the models can also beused for change detection.  iSM has been tested on our autonomousvehicle to create photorealistic 3D models while the rover traverses inunknown environments.Moreover, a proofofconcept iSM payload has been mounted oniRobot Wayfarer Packbot with autonomous urban reconnaissancecapabilities.  Wayfarer uses wheel odometry for localization and builds2D occupancy grid maps from a laser sensor.   While Wayfarer isfollowing walls and avoiding obstacles, iSM captures and processesimages to create photorealistic 3D models.  Experimental results showthat iSM can complement Wayfarers autonomous navigation in twoways.  The photorealistic 3D models provide better situationalawareness than 2D grid maps.   Moreover, iSM also recovers thecamera motion, also known as the visual odometry.  As wheel odometryerror grows over time, this can help improve the wheel odometry forbetter localization.656134, Session 4A scalable soldiermachine interface for humanroboticinteractionS. Scheiner, DCS Corp.As part of the CrewAutomated and integration Testbed CAT AdvancedTechnology Objective ATO, the US Army Tankautomotive andArmaments Research, Development, and Engineering Center TARDECdeveloped crew stations that provided soldiers the ability to controlboth manned and unmanned vehicles.  The crew stations weredesigned to optimize soldier workload and provide the ability toconduct mission planning, route planning, reconnaissance, surveillance,and target acquisition RSTA, and fire control capabilities.  The crewstation software is fully configurable, portable between crew stations,and interoperable with one another.  However, the software architecturewas optimized for the specific computing platform utilized by each crewstation and user interfaces were hard coded.  Current CAT crew stationcapabilities are required to execute on other crew station configurationsas well as handheld devices to meet the needs of expanded soldierroles, including dismounted infantry.   TARDEC is currently exploringways to develop a scalable software architecture that is able to adapt tothe physical characteristics of differing computing platforms anddevices.  In addition, based upon a soldiers role, the software must beable to adapt and optimize the displays based upon individual soldierneeds.  And finally, the software must be capable of applying a uniquestyle to the presentation of information to the soldier.  Future programsrequire more robust software architectures that take these requirementsinto account.  This paper will describe how scalable softwarearchitectures can be designed to address each of these uniquerequirements.656135, Session 4Unmanned multicontrol based on voice recognition ofmobile robotS. Cho, UREATac Co., LTD. South KoreaIn this paper it is presented a new approach to the design of cruisecontrol system of a mobile robot with two drive wheel.

Raibert, M. G. Buehler, R. R. Playter, Boston DynamicsThis paper provides a status report on BigDog, a selfcontainedquadruped robot designed for roughterrain locomotion.  The purposeof BigDog is to provide a robot that can go where the dismountedsoldier goes, traveling at soldier speed on terrain too rough for anyexisting wheeled or tracked vehicle. BigDog is designed to be powerautonomous, to carrying significant loads, and to operate in outdoorsand urban settings.  The latest version of BigDog is about 1 m tall, 1 mlong and 0.3 m wide, and weighs about 90 kg. BigDog hasdemonstrated walking, trotting, bounding and pronking gaits, as well asstanding up and sitting down.  It has walked up and down 35 degreeinclines, walked on rocky surfaces, carried a 60 kg load and reached atop speed of 3.1 ms 6.8 mph not all at the same time.  Since firstoperation in 2004, BigDog has logged over one hundred hours ofwalking, climbing and running time.  We are currently expandingBigDogs roughterrain mobility to include steeper inclines, screesurfaces, and a variety of obstaclecluttered environments.  BigDog isfunded by DARPA, with additional funding from the US Army and USMarine Corps.656137, Session 5Heading stabilization and antirollover for chaosM. Berkemeier, E. Poulson, S. King, Autonomous Solutions, Inc.Chaos is a 2manportable teleoperated vehicle designed for crossingrugged terrain. Chaos is capable of crossing large piles of cinderblocks, picnic tables, and steep hills of loose soil. These feats areaccomplished through use of 4 independent track arms, each of whichcan be articulated at an arbitrary angle and driven at an arbitrary speed.These make the vehicle extremely capable but also demand significantskill on the part of the user. It is therefore desirable to automate the armangles and track speeds to ease operator burden. This paper reports onpreliminary efforts to implement 2 intelligent behaviors along theselines. The first involves heading stabilization A gyroscope is used tosense yaw and yaw rate, and these are compared with the operatorscommands. Deviations are then used to automatically correct theheading. This is useful when Chaos is climbing stairs or other bumpyterrain, which can cause the vehicle to veer off in unwanted directions.We call the other behavior antirollover. In this case, the output of agyroscope is monitored to detect if roll or pitch thresholds areexceeded. When they are, the track arms are automatically positionedto stabilize the vehicle and keep it right side up. Experimental results forboth algorithms are included.656138, Session 5The OmniTread OT4 Serpentine Robot new features andexperimentsJ. Borenstein, Univ. of MichiganSerpentine robots are slender, multisegmented vehicles designed toprovide greater mobility than conventional wheeled or tracked robots.Serpentine robots are thus ideally suited for urban search and rescue,military intelligence gathering, and for surveillance and inspection tasksin hazardous and hardtoreach environments. One such serpentinerobot, currently under development at the University of Michigan, is theOmniTread OT4. The OT4 comprises seven segments, which arelinked to each other by 2degreeoffreedom joints. Moving tracks on allfour sides of each segment assure propulsion even when the vehiclerolls over. The OT4 climbs over high obstacles propel itself inside pipesof different diameters, even vertically, and traverse difficult terrain suchas rocks or the rubble of a collapsed structure.The foremost and unique design characteristic of the OT4 is the use ofpneumatic bellows to actuate the joints. The pneumatic bellows allowthe simultaneous control of position and stiffness for each joint.Controllable stiffness is of crucial importance in serpentine robots,which require stiff joints to cross gaps and compliant joints to conformto rough terrain for effective propulsion.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 217Another unique feature of the OmniTread design is the maximalcoverage of all four sides of each segment with driven tracks. Thisdesign makes the robot indifferent to rollovers, which are bound tohappen when the slender bodies of serpentine robots travel overrugged terrain.This paper describes the design features of the OT4 in detail and anextensive Experiment Results Section documents the OT4sperformance.656139, Session 5Development of a convertible wheeled robotD. Danknick, Applied Minds Inc.Under funding provided by the US ArmyTACOM and NorthropGrumman, AMI engineers designed, fabricated and built an 800 lb.walkingrolling robot with an integrated power system. It was intendedto test hybrid locomation designs on varying road surfaces using COTSactuation and motion control. Design considerations were given to thecurrent military fuel infrastructure, easy maintenance and functionalabstraction for future upgrades.656140, Session 5Design and analysis an omnidirectional mobile robot inrough terrainM. R. Udengaard, K. D. Iagnemma, Massachusetts Institute ofTechnologyMobile robots are finding increasing use in military, disaster recovery,and exploration applications.  Conventional wheeled and trackedmobile robots can find navigation in cluttered, rocky, or obstacle denseurban environments can be difficult or impossible.  This is partly due tothe fact that traditional tracked and wheeled vehicles must reorient toperform some maneuvers, such as lateral displacement.Omnidirectional mobile robots have the ability to track neararbitrarymotion profiles regardless of pose.  To date, nearly all designs andanalyses of omnidirectional robots have considered the case of motionon flat, smooth terrain.  This paper presents a design for anomnidirectional mobile robot driven by active split offset casters to beoperated on rough, uneven terrain.  Robot isotropy characteristics areanalyzed as a function of vehicle geometry and configuration on bothflat and rough terrain.  A simple kinematic control scheme thatconsiders the effects of terrain unevenness is presented.  Theperformance of the algorithm in rough terrain is studied in simulation.  Itis shown that an omnidirectional mobile robot can be designed tomaintain a high level of mobility over rough terrain.656141, Session 5Design and control of a 12 DOF bipdal robotB. T. Krupp, Yobotics, Inc. J. E. Pratt, Institute for Human andMachine Cognition A. Vesper, Yobotics, Inc.We propose an iterative design approach, combining dynamiccomputer simulation with computer aided design, to develop a batterypowered, electrically actuated, twelve degree of freedom bipedal robot.In order to achieve high force fidelity and low impedance, Series ElasticActuation techniques are applied to the electric actuators.  In order toreduce cable harness requirements, a CAN Bus interface isimplemented using real time Java running on a PC104 computersystem.The design process begins with estimation of the robots physicalparameters. These estimations, which are based primarily on intuitionand experience, are used to create a physically realistic simulationmodel of the robot.  Next, a control algorithm is implemented insimulation to produce the desired gait in this case, bipedal walking.Using the joint power requirements and range of motions fromsimulation, designers are able to work backward calculating actuatorstroke, force and speed.  Components that meet or exceed thesespecifications are chosen and an electromechanical framework isdesigned to combine the components into a working machine.  UsingCAD software, the physical parameters of the robot are calculated.  Theoriginal physical parameter estimates are replaced with the CADestimates and new joint power requirements are produced.  Theprocess continues until and acceptable design has been achieved.  Thedesign is then migrated from paper to the real world.656143, Session 5Tetrahedral robotics based on addressablereconfigurable architectureG. L. Brown, Jr., NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr.GSFC is developing a family of Tetrahedral robots based on theAddressable Reconfigurable Architecture ART.  The basic unit of ARTis a reconfigurable tetrahedron with variable length struts connected byflexible joints. We completed a demonstration prototype of a singletetrahedron walker 1TET in 20042005 that walks by shifting its centerof gravity and tumbling in alternating directions.  Multiple reconfigurabletetrahedra can be connected together to form complex multifunctionalstructures. This highly integrated threedimensional mesh of actuatorsand structural elements are addressable like pixels in an LCD screenand can be choreographed to exhibit complex behaviors like climbing,rolling, slithering, and tunneling.  The architecture is modular, scalable,selfsimilar, and provides great flexibility and failsafe redundancy.Presently, we are building a 12tetrahedral walker 12TET with 9 nodesand 26 struts.  Each strut is designed with a 5.31 extendable lengthratio which enables the robot structure to assume a wide array ofshapes and configure itself to move with a variety of gaits over a varietyof terrain.  The walker can stretch or contract to conform to the terrain,move up a 40 incline or stairs, and climb over obstacles 1.2 times itscontracted height which eliminates many of the disadvantages ofwheeled rovers.The scalable technology can be implemented in large scale structuresor miniaturized to MEMSbased ART structures MART and in future,nanotechnologybased Super Miniaturized ART structures SMART.The near and midterm implementations of this architecture provide anew pathway for enabling extensive reconfigurable robotic terrestrialand planetary exploration, which an emphasis on supporting the NASAExploration Initiative, with sustained human presence on the Moon andMars. The ARTs maneuverability and ability to reconfigure itself make itparticularly useful in but not limited to situations where tasks must beperformed in inhospitable environments e.g., gathering environmentalsamples, finding and defusing bombs, search and recovery, etc..  OtherART applications are collapsible habitat structures or adjustable mirrorsand antennas.We propose to demonstrate the 1TET andor 12TET prototypes atSPIE 2007.  We also plan to have a Technology Exhibit.  A video of the1TET walking in GSFC can be viewed at httpants.gsfc.nasa.govfeaturessteppin.mpg.656144, Session 5Fuelcell powered UGVJ. S.

The vehicle attributesinclude high mobility, quiet operation, and zero emissions.  The paperwill review the decision criteria for high mobility and the minimum powerrequirements needed. Implementation of the fuel cell requires specialconsiderations for hydrogen supply, humidification, heat transfer, andpower management.  The vehicle mission includes carrying andpowering a directed energy device for neutralizing improvisedexplosionary devices.  Other missions might include long rangedetection of nuclear and biological contamination or measurements ofsoil strength for mobility prediction of heavy military vehicle systems.Future work includes the design of a larger hybrid system employing adiesel engine and fuel cell power for extended range, load capacity, aswell as silent operation.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX218 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656145, Session 5Slider walkerP.

Odedra, S. Prior, M. Karamanoglu, Middlesex Univ. UnitedKingdomUnmanned Ground Vehicles UGV, whether autonomous or teleoperated, can carry out tasks using the hardware available to thesystem. Even though this hardware gives the system the capabilities tocarry out specific tasks, it also means that it is limited to these tasks.This is important when looking at a UGVs locomotive ability, forexample tracks give a system the ability to drive over rough terrain, butin turn the use of tracks hampers the vehicles speed and its ability tomanoeuvre on indoor surfaces such as carpet.This paper focuses on the research being carried out to developinnovative solutions to give unmanned ground vehicles the ability to beable to cope with potentially any task in any condition whether knownor unknown. Our research will lead to a mobility system, which cantransform in order to cope with transitions between environments orencountering obstacles such as stairs. These mobility systems will haveincorporated sensors used to feel the immediate environment andfeedback important information to either the user, or the system in thecase of autonomy, and then decisions can be made on which mobilitytype or configuration would best suite the conditions. This will ultimatelyincrease any systems potential and create an intelligent, multifunctionalplatform with high mission capabilities.656148, Session 6A man portable hybrid UAVUGV systemP. Rudakevych, B. M. Yamauchi, iRobot Corp.The range of existing UGVs is limited, restricting them from tactical use.We developed a prototype air mobility system that attaches to aPackBot that allows the PackBot to be delivered tens of miles awayfrom the operator, at which point the PackBot is deployed to the groundand the air mobility system loiters as a radio link above the area ofoperations.The man portable UAV portion is unique in that it can carry 50 lbs ofpayload and still be carried and operated by a single soldier, from anunimproved field. The UAV continues to operate after a substantialmass change when deploying the PackBot. This is accomplished byusing a powered parafoil.We present the concept, variations on possible missions, and resultsfrom our proof of concept vehicle trials, including some videos.656149, Session 6MultiUAV autonomous collaborative behaviors forconvoy protectionY. Chen, M. A. Peot, J. Lee, V. Sundareswaran, T. W. Altshuler,Teledyne Scientific Co.MultiUAV autonomous collaborative operation is a key capability forefficient and effective deployment of large numbers of UAVs per FCSUnit of Action UoA under U. S. Armys vision for Force Transformation.We have been developing an extensible architecture and behaviorplanning  collaborative approach, named Autonomous CollaborativeMission Systems ACMS, to achieve this level of capability. Thearchitecture is modular and the modules may be run in differentlocationsplatforms to accommodate the constraints of availablehardware, processing resources and mission needs. The modules anduniform interfaces provide a consistent and platformindependentbaseline mission collaboration mechanism and signaling protocolacross different platforms. Further, the modular design allows flexibleand convenient insertion of new autonomous collaborative behaviors tothe ACMS. In this article, we present our simulation results and analysisin applying various autonomous collaborative behaviors developed inthe ACMS to an integrated convoy protection scenario.656150, Session 6Development of a GPSINSMAG navigation system andwaypoint navigator for a VTOL UAVO. Meister, R. Mnikes, J. Wendel, N. M. Frietsch, C. Schlaile, G. F.Trommer, Univ. Karlsruhe GermanyUnmanned aerial vehicles UAV can be used for versatile surveillanceand reconnaissance missions. If a UAV is capable of flying automaticallyon a predefined path, the range of possible applications is widenedsignificantly.This paper addresses the development of the integrated GPSINSnavigation system and a waypoint navigator for a small vertical takeoffand landing VTOL  unmanned fourrotor helicopter with a takeoffweight below 1 kg.The core of the navigation system consists of low cost inertial sensorswhich are continuously aided with GPS, magnetometer compass, and abarometric height information. Due to the fact that the yaw anglebecomes unobservable during hovering flight, the integration with amagnetic compass is mandatory.This integration must be robust with respect to errors caused by theterrestrial magnetic field deviation and interferences from surroundingelectronic devices as well as ferrite metals. The described integrationconcept with a Kalman filter overcomes the problem that erroneousmagnetic measurements yield to an attitude error in the roll and pitchaxis. The algorithm provides longterm stable navigation informationeven during GPS outages which is mandatory for the flight control ofthe UAV.Details of the developed waypoint navigation algorithms are discussed.Flight test results of the implemented modes of operation with differentlevels of autonomy are shown. In a position hold mode the helicoptermaintains its position regardless of wind disturbances which ease thepilot job during hold and stare missions. Flight test result shows that thepresented waypoint navigator overcomes limitation of operation withinline of sight as well as the range of the radio link.656151, Session 7Deployable reconnaissance from a VTOL UAS in urbanenvironmentsS. Barnett, A. Culhane, A. Sharkasi, J. Bird, C. F. Reinholtz, VirginiaPolytechnic Institute and State Univ.Reconnaissance collection in unknown or hostile environments can be adangerous and life threatening task.  To reduce this risk, the UnmannedSystems Group at Virginia Tech has produced a fully autonomousreconnaissance system able to provide live video reconnaissance fromoutside and inside unknown structures.  This system consists of anautonomous helicopter which launches a small, reconnaissance podinside a building and an operator control unit OCU on a groundstation.  The helicopter is a modified Bergen Industrial Twin using aRotomotion flight controller and can fly missions of up to one half hour.The mission planning OCU can control the helicopter remotely throughteleoperation or fully autonomously by GPS waypoints.  A forwardfacing camera and template matching aid in navigation by identifyingthe target building.  Once the target structure is identified, visionalgorithms will center the UAS adjacent to open windows or doorways.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 219Tunable parameters in the vision algorithm account for varying launchdistances and opening sizes.  Launch of the reconnaissance pod maybe initiated remotely through a human in the loop or autonomously.Compressed air propels the half pound stationary pod or the largermobile pod into the open portals.  Once inside the building, thereconnaissance pod will then transmit live video and audio back to thehelicopter.  The helicopter acts as a repeater node for increased videorange and simplification of communication back to the ground station.656152, Session 7Macrofiber composites for wing morphing microairvehiclesO. Bilgen, D. J. Inman, A. J. Kurdila, Virginia Polytechnic Instituteand State Univ.Conventional surface control techniques have been used in carbon fibercomposite, membranewing autonomous microairvehicles MAV.However, articulated lifting surfaces and articulated wing sections aredifficult to instrument in a repeatable fashion.  Assembly is complex andtime consuming. The authors aim to implement morphing wings onautonomous MAVs that are actuated via active materials.  The resultantdesigns are advantageous in that they are 1 solid state and 2 capableof highly agile maneuver.  Active actuation is achieved via a type ofpiezoceramic composite called Macro Fiber Composite MFC.Initial experimental results show that MFC actuation does haveauthority to control aerodynamic forces for MAVs. Due to unsteadyforces caused by air flow, signal to noise ratio was low at theexperiments where either actuation or air velocity was low.  As the airvelocity or the actuation voltage was increased, the changes in the netforce on the MAV were clearly visible. Wing actuation was alsoquantified by simply actuating the wing with MFC and measuring themaximum deflection in the wing. The experiments proved that MFC issuitable for surface control of flexible wing micro air vehicles.The completed paper will investigate the roll actuation and control ofMFC actuated MAV in unsteady air flow.   The current MAVs arecontrolled by servos, accelerometers and gyros.  MFC will be used toreplace these components since the MFC can be used both as a sensorand actuator.  This is considered unique in the field of micro air vehicles.A control mechanism will be constructed by analytical and FEMmethods.656153, Session 7Toward distributed ATR using subjective logiccombination rules with networked UAVsS. OHara, 21st Century Systems, Inc. and Univ. of NebraskaOmaha M. Simon, 21st Century Systems, Inc. Q. Zhu, Univ. ofNebraskaOmahaIn this paper, we present our initial findings demonstrating hownetworked video cameras augmented with limited computationalcapabilities can be used to provide ATR services in a computationallydistributed manner. We call this Distributed ATR DATR. Our paperdescribes the utility of DATR for autonomous Unmanned Aerial VehicleUAV operations and shows how we implemented a proofofconceptusing an inexpensive gumsticksized computing device.Our technology is aimed towards small and micro UAVs where platformrestrictions allow only a modest quality camera and limited onboardcomputational capabilities. It is understood that an inexpensive sensorcoupled with limited processing capability would be challenged inderiving a high PdLow Pfa classification. Our hypothesis is that theconsensus opinion of multiple DATR platforms, observing approximatelythe same scene, can raise the Pd and lower the Pfa sufficiently in orderto provide a costeffective ATR capability. This capability can lead topractical implementations of autonomous, coordinated, multiUAVoperations.The individual UAV produces a temporallyindexed beliefuncertaintyvalue based upon an onboard ATR algorithm, yielding a set of possibleclassifications for the object over the possibility space defined by a setof exemplars. We remove the very low confidence classifications andgenerate a weighted belief mass assignment over the remainingclassifications. We repeat the process for a small number ofconsecutive frames representing a fraction of a second, and usesubjective logic operators to combine the belief mass assignments overthe sample. This allows us to discard outliers and potentially boost aweaker classification that is consistent across the sampling period. Theoutput would be a set of classifications for each object, with an explicitmeasure of belief and uncertainty for each classification.When multiple platforms observe approximately the same scene, suchas when a group of UAVs flies over an area of interest, we can furtherimprove our ATR confidence by combining the results of the individualplatforms, again using subject logic algebra over the belief statements.656154, Session 7Detection and tracking of objects in an image sequencecaptured by a VTOLUAVN. M. Frietsch, O. Meister, C. Schlaile, J. Wendel, G. F. Trommer,Univ. Karlsruhe GermanyThe research activities in the field of unmanned aerial vehicles UAVhave increased constantly over the last years. Especially small UAVs areessential for surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. For efficientuse of the onboard video camera the ability to hover is desirable.This paper focusses on the automated detection and tracking ofmultiple objects in a camera sequence, that is provided by a small,electrically powered fourrotor helicopter in a hoverandstare scenario.After an appropriate preprocessing of the raw image data,independently moving areas are identified. Two different approaches areinvestigated and compared. The first approach is based on thecompensation of the camera movement by estimation of homographies.Moving regions are extracted by image subtraction and appropriatefiltering. The second approach is based on the optical flow field. Singlepoints that move not consistently with the background plane areidentified and merged into objects by a cluster analysis algorithm.A Kalman filter is used to estimate characteristic object parameters,that allows the continuous tracking of an object. Due to severalreasons, not every extracted area corresponds to an independentlymoving object. A joint probabilistic data association as well as aheuristic ruleset are used to sort out artefacts.After a detailed description of the image processing and trackingalgorithms, the performance of the developed algorithms is illustratedusing inflight UAV camera sequences with focus on the detectability ofobjects with different sizes and speeds.Finally, first steps towards a simple geographically referencing of thetracked objects are described.656155, Session 7An intelligent algorithm for unmanned aerial vehiclesurveillanceA. Bhargave, B. E. Ambrose, F. S. Lin, Broadata Communications,Inc.A intelligent swarmbased guidance and path planning algorithm isdescribed for the Uumaned Arieal Vehicles UAV to efficiently carry outgrid surveillance, taking into account specific UAV constraints such asmaximum speed, maximum flight time and battery recharging intervalsto allow for continuous surveillance. The swarmbased flight planning isbased on enhancements of distributed computing concepts that havebeen developed for NASAs launch danger zone protection. Thealgorithm is a modified version of ant colony optimization theorydescribing ant food foraging. Ants initially follow random paths from thenest, but if food is found, the ant deposits a pheromone modifying thelocal environment, which influences other ants to travel the same path.Once the food source is exhausted, the pheromone decays naturally,which causes the trail to disappear. When an ant is on an establishedtrail, it may at any time decide to follow a new random path, allowing fornew exploration. Using these concepts, in our system for UAV, we usetwo units, the Rendezvous unit and the Patrol unit. The Rendezvousunits will act as pheromone deposit sites keeping a record of trails ofinterest extra pheromone that decays over time, and obstacles noConf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX220 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsspheromone. The search area is divided into a grid of areas. Each areaunit is assigned a pheromone weight. The patrol unit picks an area unitbased on a probabilistic formula consisting of parameters like therelative weight of trail intensity, area visibility to the unit, the distance ofthe patrol unit from area, and the pheromone decay factor. Simulation ofa UAV surveillance system based on the above algorithm showed that ithad the ability to perform independently and reliably without humanintervention, and the emergent nature of algorithm had the ability toincorporate important aspects of unmanned surveillance.656156, Session 7Cooperative control architectures for a team of UAVssubject to communications failuresK. Khorasani, Concordia Univ. CanadaTo utilize the full capabilities of UAVs, a large body of research havebeen  conducted on development of UAV cooperative controlstrategies. In this paper cooperative control implies coordinating theactivities of a team of vehicles so that they work together to completetasks in order to achieve a common goal. However, coordinating theoperations of a team of vehicles requires that information be sharedamong the team members. One of the most significant hurdles for thisis to develop cooperation strategies that incorporate strictcommunication constraints a UAV is subjected to. Other challengesassociated with developing cooperation strategies for UAVs aredevelopment of decentralized cooperation strategies, and robustness ofthese strategies to either a failure or gradual performance degradationof individual team members. In this paper UAV cooperative controlproblems are investigated that involve several subproblems such ascooperative path planning and trajectory generation, multiple UAV taskallocation, multiple UAV cooperative timing problems, and cooperativeUAV target search. Different architectures are developed to address thecooperative rendezvous problem, which requires multiple UAVs to arrivesimultaneously at their destinations to maximize survivability. Thecooperative control strategies developed are based on the notion ofcoordination variable and coordination functions. For the rendezvousproblem, the coordination variable is the teamoptimal time over target,which is the minimal amount of information needed by the vehicles toachieve the task of simultaneous intercept. The coordination functionsdifferent for each vehicle parameterize the effect of changes in thecoordination variable on the objectives of the individual vehicles.Centralized and decentralized methodologies are proposed for solvingthe rendezvous problem. In the centralized solution a centralizedrendezvous manager is required that selects the team coordinationvariable based upon the coordination functions, and a set of feasibletime over target ranges of all the UAVs. None of the vehicles are awareof each others coordination functions and set of feasible time overtarget ranges. Hence, if a failure were to occur at the rendezvousmanger, the entire scheme will fail. In the decentralized solution, theteam coordination variable is calculated by the identical coordinationmanager residing on each vehicle. As in the centralized solution, eachvehicle calculates its coordination function and a set of feasible timeover target ranges, which it then communicates through itscommunication manager to all the other vehicles comprising the team.Hence, the decentralized approach, unlike the centralized solution,increases the teams robustness to a singlepoint failure. Since therendezvous strategies developed thus far in the literature do notformally address faults in the system, one of the contributions of thispaper involves the incorporation of faults sensor, actuator, orcommunication into the development of the cooperative rendezvousalgorithms.656157, Session 7Visionbased sensing for autonomous inflight refuelingD. A. Scott, M. Toal, J. L. Dale, Octec Ltd. United KingdomA significant capability of unmanned airborne vehicles UAVs is thatthey can operate tirelessly and at maximum efficiency in comparison totheir human pilot counterparts. However a major limiting factorpreventing ultralong endurance missions is that they require landing torefuel. Development effort has been directed to allow UAVs toautomatically refuel in the air using current refueling systems andprocedures. The hose  drogue refuelling system was targeted as it isconsidered the more difficult case.  Recent flight trials resulted in thefirstever fully autonomous airborne refuelling operation.Development has gone into precision GPSbased navigation sensors tomanoeuvre the aircraft into the stationkeeping position and onwards todock with the refuelling drogue. However in the terminal phases ofdocking, the accuracy of the GPS is operating at its performance limitand also disturbance factors on the flexible hose and basket are notpredictable using an openloop model. Hence there is significantuncertainty on the position of the refuelling drogue relative to theaircraft, and is insufficient in practical operation to achieve a successfuland safe docking.A solution is to augment the GPS based system with a visionbasedsensor component through the terminal phase to visually acquire andtrack the drogue in 3D space. The higher bandwidth and resolution ofcamera sensors gives significantly better estimates on the state of thedrogue position. Disturbances in the actual drogue position caused bysubtle aircraft manoeuvres and wind gusting can be visually trackedand compensated for, providing an accurate estimate.This paper discusses the issues involved in visually detecting arefuelling drogue, selecting an optimum camera viewpoint, andacquiring and tracking the drogue throughout a widely varying operatingrange and conditions.656158, Session 8Urban search and rescue robot performance standardsprogress updateE. R. Messina, A. Jacoff, National Institute of Standards andTechnologyIn this paper, we describe work in performance standards for urbansearch and rescue USR robots, begun in 2004 by the Department ofHomeland Security. This program is being coordinated by the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology and will result in consensusstandards developed through ASTM International, under theOperational Equipment Subcommittee of their Homeland SecurityCommittee. A comprehensive approach to performance requirementsand standards development is being used in this project. Formal testmethods designed by several working groups in the standards taskgroup are validated by the stakeholders. These tests are complementedby regular exercises in which responders and robot manufacturers worktogether to apply robots within realistic training scenarios. This paperrecaps the most recent exercise, held at the Federal EmergencyManagement FEMA Maryland Task Force 1 training facility, at whichover twenty different robots were operated by responders from variousFEMA Task Forces.  The exercise included candidate standard testmethods being developed for requirements in the areas ofcommunications, mobility, sensors, and humansystem interaction forUSR robots.656159, Session 8Unified plan languageJ. J. Ackley, Science Applications International Corp. R. L. Wade,U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development andEngineering Ctr.With the steady increase in the numbers of unmanned systemsdeployed, the problem of representing and communicating plans forindividual and teams of unmanned systems is reaching a critical stage.Numerous attempts have been made to create a plan representationlanguage for manned and unmanned systems each with their ownstrengths and weaknesses. This paper presents the Unified PlanLanguage UPL, an attempt to leverage the strengths of the previousefforts while diminishing their weaknesses.A plan is a set of objectives to be achieved, a series of activities toperform in order to achieve the objectives, and a set of constraints thatmust hold throughout the execution of the plan. It is difficult to arrive ata common representation for plans because each domain andenvironment will have its own terminology for activities, scope andConf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 221nature of the objectives, and the types of constraints. The semantics ofeach term must be agreed to by all, and yet the representation languagemust be extensible to support new and expansion of existing domains.The paper begins with a discussion of the problem of representing andcommunicating plans and why it is so difficult, followed by a statementof requirements for representing plans and a review of existing planlanguages. It proceeds with a look at the technologies UPL leverages,and how UPL satisfies the stated requirements. Several applicationsand examples are explored to demonstrate the language, followed by areview of findings and a discussion of future work.656160, Session 8USARSim a RoboCup Virtual Urban Search and RescuecompetitionS. B. Balakirsky, C. Scrapper, National Institute of Standards andTechnology S. Carpin, International Univ. Bremen GmbH GermanyM. Lewis, Univ. of PittsburghResearch efforts in Urban Search And Rescue USAR robotics havegrown substantially in recent years. A virtual USAR robotic competitionwas established in 2006 under the RoboCup umbrella to fostercollaboration amongst institutions and to provide benchmark testenvironments for system evaluation. In this paper we describe thesoftware simulation framework that is used in this competition and therules and performance metrics used to determine the leagues winner.The framework allows for the realistic modeling of robots, sensors, andactuators, as well as complex, unstructured, dynamic environments.Multiple heterogeneous agents can be concurrently placed in thesimulation environment thus allowing for team or group evaluations.656161, Session 8Characterizing unmanned system autonomy theautonomy levels for unmanned systems ALFUSframeworkH. Huang, National Institute of Standards and TechnologyThe Autonomy Levels for Unmanned Systems ALFUS workshop seriesaddresses the vehicles autonomy issues.  Practitioners have differentperceptions or different expectations for the systems.  The requirementson human interactions, the types of tasks, the teaming of the unmannedsystems UMS and the humans, and the operating environment are justa few of the issues that need to be clarified.  Also needed are a set ofdefinitions and a model with which the autonomy capability of the UMScan be described.  This paper reports the current results and status ofthe ALFUS framework, which practitioners can apply to analyze theautonomy requirements and to evaluate the performance of their roboticprograms.656162, Session 8Prediction in dynamic environments algorithmicperformance evaluation in urban driving scenariosC. I. Schlenoff, Z. Kootbally, R. Madhavan, National Institute ofStandards and TechnologyIn this paper, we provide an overview of the PRIDE Prediction inDynamic Environments framework and describe a series of steps thatwere taken to validate the performance of the moving object predictionalgorithms within this framework.PRIDE Prediction In Dynamic Environments, a hierarchicalmultiresolutional framework for moving object prediction thatincorporates multiple prediction algorithms into a single, unifyingframework. PRIDE is based upon the 4DRCS Realtime ControlSystem reference model architecture and provides information toplanners at the level of granularity that is appropriate for their planninghorizon. This framework supports the prediction of the future location ofmoving objects at various levels of resolution, thus providing predictioninformation at the frequency and level of abstraction necessary forplanners at different levels within the hierarchy. To date, two predictionapproaches have been applied to this framework.The performance evaluation of PRIDE was performed by comparing theresults of its prediction algorithms to known recorded time intervals andtrajectories of a vehicle on public roadways. The public roadways weremodeled in USARSim. USARSim is a highfidelity simulation of robotsand environments based on the Unreal Tournament game engine. Thelocation of the vehicle at a predetermined start point was placed in thesimulated roadways to correspond to its actual position on the physicalroadway. The results of the prediction algorithms were then comparedto the actual velocity and trajectory of the vehicle to judge theperformance of the prediction algorithms.656163, Session 8A timeslotted ondemand routing protocol for mobile adhoc unmanned vehicle systemsJ. H. Forsmann, Idaho National Lab. R. Hiromoto, Univ. of Idaho J.M. Svoboda, Idaho National Lab.Successful deployment of Unmanned Vehicle Systems UVS in militaryoperations has increased their popularity and utility. The ability tosustain reliable mobile ad hoc formations dramatically enhances theusefulness and performance of UVS. Formation movement increasesthe amount of ground coverage in less time, decreases fuelconsumption of the individual nodes, and provides an avenue formission expansion through cooperative maneuvers such as refueling.In this paper, we study the resulting wireless communication demandsfrom formation and maintenance of UVS within the context of a mobilead hoc network MANET.  A MANET in formation is typicallycharacterized by tradeoffs between network congestion and themaintenance of useful communication bandwidth.  The maintenance ofUVS formations requires each node in the network to be peeraware,which places a heavy demand on inner node communication.In order to mitigate the inner node network congestion, we introduce atimeslotted communication protocol.  The protocol assigns timeslotsand allows the designated nodes to communicate directly with otherpeernodes.  This approach has been introduced within the context ofthe TimeSlotted Aloha protocol for stationtostation communication.The approach taken here is to embedded the timeslotted reservationprotocol into a standard ondemand routing protocol to also addressthe need to reactively and proactively respond to formationmaintenance.The timeslotted ondemand routing protocol is shown to eliminatecollisions and, therefore, enhance quality of service as well as ensurenecessary support for formation movement.  A worstcase scenario isdescribed and simulations performed to comparatively demonstrate theadvantages of the new protocol.656164, Session 8Performance evaluation of a 3D imaging system forvehicle safetyA. M. Lytle, S. M. Szabo, G. S.

Thiswork supports the broader effort to develop open, consensusbasedperformance evaluation standards for a wide range of 3D imagingsystems and applications through the ASTM E57 Committee on 3DImaging Systems.  This report presents initial efforts to characterize therange performance of a 3D imaging sensor which will be used in aperformance measurement system for crash prevention and safetysystems.  Factors examined include range, target reflectance, targetangle of incidence, and sensor azimuth.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX222 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656166, Session 9Terrain aware inversion of predictive models for highperformance UGVsA. J. Kelly, Carnegie Mellon Univ.The capacity to predict motion adequately over the time scale of a fewseconds is fundamental to autonomous mobility. The quality of suchpredictions depends directly on the capacity to anticipate theconsequences of the forces applied by the terrain to the vehicle.However, autonomy also requires a capacity to consider multiplealternatives and rate them based on utility, cost, risk, opportunity etc. inorder to select a best one. Model predictive optimal control is a generalformalism within which most approaches since the beginning of the fieldcan be cast as special cases. Applications continue to grow in ambitionto seek higher precision of motion andor higher vehicle speeds.Predictions must therefore improve in fidelity and speed simultaneously.At the National Robotics Engineering Center we have recently beenfavoring a technique that we call parametric optimal control. Thisapproach formulates the original optimal control problem as one ofnonlinear programming  optimizing over a space of parameterizedcontrols encoding all feasible motions. Using this technique, we havedeveloped a core capacity to efficiently invert the solutions to theequations of motion for a ground vehicle. Such an inversion enables acomputation of precisely the command signals necessary to drive thevehicle to goal position, heading, and curvature while following thecontours of the terrain under arbitrary wheel terrain interactions.Dynamics inversion is so fundamental that many other mobility behaviorscan be constructed from it. Fielded applications include pallet acquisitioncontrols for factory AGVs and high speed adaptive path following formilitary UGVs. We have also applied the technique successfully to theproblem of compensation for wheel slip on the Mars Exploration Roversand the problem of full configuration space planning in dense obstaclefields. We believe the technique may also advance the state of the art inhigh speed obstacle avoidance and slow speed obstacle negotiation.656167, Session 9Amphibious modular robot astrobiologistM. Yim, Univ. of PennsylvaniaA modular robot system called CKBot is made up of a large number ofidentical modules and several specialized modules.  These modules maybe combined together in different configurations to form robots capableof different tasks.  This paper presents the design and experimentation ofone set of configurations for an amphibious robot applied to theastrobiolocal domain.Astrobiologists study the origins of life.  Part of this work involves fieldtrips where a variety of tasks can be aided or replicated robotically.  Anastrobiologist on a field study will spend most of the time walking aroundand exploring the site looking for areas of interest which will be tested insitu or sampled for testing offsite. For a robot replicating these tasks, itmust be able to locomote in that terrain, sense the interesting features orprovide sensing for teleoperation, and do a variety of manipulation tasksonce an area of interest is reached.The configurations for this robot include 10s modules and can achieveastrobiological tasks such as amphibious locomotion, digging, coresampling, probing, liquid sampling and exploration. This paper alsopresents results from the first experiments of this platform at Lake Tyrrell,a salt lake in Australia. Most tasks were successful on this first attempt.656168, Session 9Symbolic perceptionbased autonomous driving indynamic environments using 4DRCSM. Foedisch, R. Madhavan, C. I. Schlenoff, National Institute ofStandards and TechnologyOur recent efforts have focused on the development of symbolicrepresentations and their extraction from sensor data for onroad drivingin dynamic environments. We contend that such rich symbolicrepresentations can reduce the burden on sensory processing bydynamically directing it to look for particular features in expectedlocations and subsequently facilitating the vehicle to better react topotentially dangerous situations, such as the appearance of pedestriansin the road. We follow a knowledgedriven topdown approach to vehicleperception in order to overcome issues with classical bottomupapproaches, which can suffer from loss of information on the transition tohigher levels and, therefore, cause failure in highlevel sceneinterpretation through accumulation of locally insignificant inaccuracieson each level.4DRCS is a hierarchical architecture designed for the control ofintelligent systems. One of the main areas that 4DRCS has been appliedto recently is the control of autonomous vehicles. To accomplish this, ahierarchical decomposition of onroad driving activities has beenperformed which has resulted in implementation of 4DRCS tailoredtowards this application. This implementation has seven layers andranges from a journey manager which determines the order of the placesyou wish to drive to, through a destination manager which provides turnbyturn directions on how to get to a destination, through a routesegment, drive behavior, elemental maneuver, goal path trajectory, andthen finally to servo controllers.In this paper, we show, within the 4DRCS architecture, how knowledgedriven topdown symbolic representations combined with lowlevelbottomup tasks can synergistically provide valuable information for onroad driving better than what is possible with either of them alone. Wedemonstrate these ideas using field data obtained from an UnmannedGround Vehicle UGV traversing urban onroad environments. We alsoinclude a discussion on the performance limits of the proposedapproaches as applied to the operational requirements imposed by onroad driving in addition to where the current research places us on thetechnology readiness level scale.656169, Session 10Mobile robots traversability awareness based on terrainvisual sensory data fusionA. H. Shirkhodaie, Tennessee State Univ.Autonomous navigation in natural terrain is an emerging technology ofinterest to DoD for military surveillance, reconnaissance, and targettracking applications and, in particular, to NASA for robotic planetaryspace exploration.  To operate autonomously and intelligently inunstructured terrain, a robot must possess many advanced navigationalskills.  In particular, it needs to have capability to perceive its surroundingenvironment, recognize hazardous circumstances, discriminatenegotiable and nonnegotiable obstacles, and select suitable routescompatible with its mobility capabilities without jeopardizing its safetyand mission.  In this paper, we have primarily discussed technicalchallenges and navigational skill requirements of mobile robots fortraversability path planning in natural terrain environments similar to Marssurface terrains.  We describe different methods for detection of salientterrain features based on imaging techniques.  We also present threecompeting techniques for terrain traversability assessment of mobilerobots navigating in unstructured natural terrain environments.  Thesethree techniques include a rulebased terrain classifier, a neural networkbased terrain classifier, and a fuzzylogic terrain classifier.   Eachproposed terrain classifier divides a region of natural terrain into finitesubterrain regions and classifies terrain condition exclusively within eachsubterrain region based on terrain visual clues.  The Particle and Kalmanfiltering techniques are applied for aggregative fusion of subterrainassessment results.  The last two terrain classifiers are shown to haveremarkable capability for terrain traversability assessment of naturalterrains.  In the paper, we demonstrate a comparative performanceevaluation of all three terrain classifiers.656170, Session 10Sensor fusion for intelligent behavior on small unmannedground vehiclesG. T.

The data provided by these sensors is vital to emergingautonomous robotic behaviors.  However, sensor data from anyindividual sensor can become noisy or erroneous under a range ofconditions, reducing the reliability of autonomous operations.  We seekto increase this reliability through data fusion.  Data fusion includescharacterizing the strengths and weaknesses of each sensor modality,and combining their data a way such that the fused data is moreaccurate than each sensors individual data contribution. We describedata fusion efforts in three autonomous behaviors   pursuit, objectdetection and recognition, and targettracking.  These behaviors areimplemented and tested under  a variety of realistic conditions, andtheir performance compared with that of singlesensor methods.656171, Session 10Utilizing simulation technologies in the development ofautonomous platformsO. Har, T. Shintel, HarTech Technologies Ltd. IsraelThe modern combat theater is being populated by an increasingnumber of unmanned platforms that are operated in a wide variety ofmissions. These platforms, like manned platforms in joint operations,have to operate in concert as an integrated force. The operation of largenumbers of unmanned platforms in a specific mission requires the useof autonomous platforms which can operate without a tight operatorcontrol. Such a paradigm enables a single operator or a small group ofoperators to control a large force of unmanned platforms conducting amission similarly to the HQ commandsupport that a manned force willbe receiving. The need to increase the autonomous capabilities ofunmanned platforms operating in an integrated force promotes thedevelopment of Semi Automated Forces SAF and Fully AutomatedForces FAF.The core technologies required in the development of operational ofSAF and FAF are Platform control Sensor control Multi sensor data fusion Mission management and mission control Learning and adaptive behaviorIn a Parallel Universe Computer Generated Forces CGF are used inthe Simulation domain to populate a synthetic environment. A currentrequirement from a synthetic environment is to have it populated with alarge number of entities that behave in a sound and coherent manner.This causes a situation in which the number of trainees, exercisecontrollers and role players is not sufficient to run each entityplatformby a dedicated person and actually a high level of autonomous behavioris required from these CGFs. Therefore modern simulation and ScenarioGeneration and Animation Systems make use of CGF that areautonomous, which are guided by a Combat Doctrine, MissionDirectives, and employ autonomous planning and mission managementmodules. These CGFs are reactive and responsive to the arena in whichthey operate and perform as SAF and FAF within the syntheticenvironment. In addition in simulation systems adaptive behavior andlearning technologies are used to create realistic changing scenariosthat present a more challenging environment for trainees in trainingsystems.The technology used for the development and operation of modernCGF highly resembles that of SAF and FAF. Decision makingmechanism developed for CGF can be reused and embedded inAutonomous platforms, as well as learning and adaptive behaviortechnologies which will enable the SAF and FAF to optimally react tothe changing conditions and the opponents behavior in the real combattheater.Importing technologies from the CGF domain for the development ofSAF and FAF provides an advantage as these technologies are alreadytested and proven in the actual management of multiple collaboratingentities as are expected to be in the future Battle Theater.656173, Session 10World representations for unmanned ground vehiclesG. S. Broten, S. P. Monckton, J. A. Collier, Defence Research andDevelopment Canada CanadaUnmanned ground vehicles, traversing unstructured, outdoor,environments, require a world representation in order to safely avoidobstacles and hazards such as beams and ditches. This paperintroduces a technique for creating such a world representation whiletraversing terrain at high speeds. The map represents the terrain aroundthe vehicle through a uniform 2 12D elevation grid. Each grid elementthat contains valid data encodes the terrain elevation, while gridelements with data are marked as unknown terrain. Range data, fromvarious ranging sensors such as laser range finders and stereo visioncameras, is fused into the terrain map using a novel variance weightedstatistical approach. This statistical approach ensures that all rangedata is optimally weighted by its associated variance. The map isimplemented as a wrappable and scrollable patch of the global worldthat is always relative to the vehicles front, centre bumper. Anegocentric terrain map, which is the world viewed from the vehiclesperspective, is derived from the global terrain map. Defence Researchand Development Canada has implemented this variance weighted,wrapping and scrolling, 2 12D terrain map on its Raptor unmannedground vehicle. Extensive field testing has shown that thisimplementation performs admirably. The terrain map accurately reflectsthe true terrain characteristics and smoothly scrolls and wraps withvehicular movement. Obstacles and slope hazards are reliably detectedby a traversability analysis algorithm thus allowing an obstacleavoidance algorithm to plan for safe corridors of travel.656174, Session 10Modeling aerodynamic coefficients for autonomoustrajectory planning of aerial vehicles using neuralnetwork approachP. Xu, A. Verma, K. Vadakkeveedu, Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.For autonomous and intelligent operations of aerial vehicles, onlinevehicle trajectory reshaping is highly desirable. For optimalperformance, the aerial vehicles may operate at the edge of feasibleregions of flight envelope, where the aerodynamics show nonlinearbehavior. Trajectory reshaping or trajectory determination algorithmssolve twopoint boundary value problem that requires a large number ofiteration for the convergence of feasible solution. The standardapproach of representing aerodynamic coefficients in tabular form is notsuitable for real time trajectory generation. For online applications andfaster convergence, it is desirable to represent aerodynamic coefficientsin smooth functional forms that capture the nonlinearity ofaerodynamic coefficients sufficiently well by few parameters.In recent work a weighted combination of piecewise smooth functionshave been used for modeling aerodynamic coefficients. In this paper wepresent our research in modeling smooth functions using a NeuralNetwork approach and compare with other approaches, such asweighted combination of piecewise smooth functions. The neuralnetwork models applied in this paper are multilayer perceptrons MLPstrained with conjugate gradient algorithms. Each MLP consists of 14input nodes representing the parameters governing aerodynamiccoefficients. One key feature of our approach is the capability to modela vehicle at various damaged conditions. We have conductedexperiments on modeling six aerodynamic coefficients generated byMissile Datcom, an aerodynamics design tool that is widely used inaerospace community. Our experimental results show that piecewisesmooth function modeling can achieve very accurate approximationgiven wellselected control points. On the other hand, a MLP model ismore efficient in training and can feasibly approximate aerodynamiccoefficients at various geometric conditions and flying states.Conf. 6561 Unmanned Systems Technology IX224 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656175, Session 10Realtime prediction and diagnostics for unmannedground vehicle UGV mobilityH.

Huh, WIA Co., Ltd. South KoreaDifferentially driven skidsteering vehicles are often considered fornavigation in outdoor terrains.However, the control of such vehicles is challenging because the wheelsmust skid laterally to follow a curved path, and motion stability can belost as a result of excess skidding due to the position of theinstantaneous center of rotation.In this paper discussed mobility analysis of 6X6 differential torquesteering vehicle from multi body dynamic analysis and drivingexperiment.656177, Poster SessionDesign of a skid steertesting system of 4x4 wheeledtypevehicleM. Kim, W. Yoo, T. Noh, H. Noh, H. Kim, Pusan National Univ. SouthKoreaIn field robots, two types of suspensions, i.e., tracked type and wheeledtype, had been widely used. Most of field robots have track typesuspension, which is more suitable for the offroad. The wheeled type,however, has advantages in speed and fuel efficiency. The research of thewheeled type vehicle had been increased to obtain a betterperformance in offroad mobility.The skid steering mechanism is useful in field robots without steeringmechanisms, because it gives many advantages. In general, the skidsteering requires smaller turning radius than steering linkage system.Thus, the need for the skid steering has been increased to provide morespace for multiwheeled type vehicles.To investigate the skid steering mechanism of a multiwheeled typevehicle, a skid steer measuring system was developed for one wheelmodel that uses an inhub motor. It was applied to the design of the sixwheeled vehicle, VGS36Variable Geometry Suspension 6x6, which isa field robot developed in CAE laboratory at the Pusan NationalUniversity in Korea.In this study, we expanded the one wheel model to a four wheeledvehicle, in which a skid steer measuring system was applied and tested.Then, changing the control signals of the inhub motors, turningefficiency was tested in the system according to the torque distributionat each wheel. And positions of the wheels and center of gravity of thevehicle were also changed to see the turning effect. From the results ofthese experiments, more effective control signals and positions of thewheels are suggested. And these results will be applied to improve thecontroller design of the VGS36.656178, Poster SessionDesign of a biologically inspired snakelike robot for allterrain useR. Manayil John, National Institute of TechnologyTiruchirappalliIndiaThe use of intelligent Unmanned Autonomous Robots in defense,civilian and planetary exploration is not something new. Most of theseapplications use Robots with wheels or tracks for locomotion withonboard camera and an arm with multiple degrees of freedom. Such akind of locomotion becomes completely useless when the terrain is fullof debris from a disaster or the inner side of a pipeline. In all theseapplications, a biologically inspired Robot with a snake like gait will be abetter option. In this paper we are discussing the design of a Robotwhich is the result of a biologically inspired idea and has the motion gaitsimilar to that of a snake.  The snake Robot consists of eight aluminumsegments which hold the electronics and actuators. Each segment hasthree degrees of freedom. The space between the segments is filledwith a crude form of MagnetoRheological MR Fluid. The wholestructure is covered with flexible rubber based sheath, which acts asthe skin. Each segment contains electronics, which contains a smallmicrocomputer, wired to the main microcomputer in the first segment orhead by means of a digital network. The first segment of the systemcontains sensors which are used for obstacle and sensing the terrain.We are on to the basic research of the system and in its very basic form,we hope that researchers around the world can modify the system andmake it more successful and robust by adding more hardware featuresand software algorithms.656179, Poster SessionPower PCenabled rapid sensor prototype developmentplatform for unmanned vehiclesJ.

D. Ellis, Wayne State Univ. G. Witus, Turing Associates, Inc.The last decade has witnessed a dramatic growth in the use ofunmanned aerial and ground vehicles UAVs and UGVs.  Mostplatforms in current use require one operator per vehicle. In order fornew unmanned systems to become the force multiplying tool they areenvisioned to be, designers of these platforms will be required todevelop new humanrobot interaction schemes that take the bestadvantage of operator skills and semiautonomous individual and teamrobot behaviors. In this paper, we explore issues related to theoperators span of control. First, we define the concept of span ofcontrol. We then propose a framework for evaluating requirements forthe human system interface at various spans of control, in the contextof operator skill, the mobile robots levels of autonomy and groupcontrol. Next, we offer observations on interaction modes andtechniques at various levels of span of control using examples from thecomputer gaming industry. Finally, we propose a framework forempirical evaluation of future interaction modes based on multiagentmultiplayer gaming environments.656182, Poster SessionOptimal steering of a mobile robotG. Cook, George Mason Univ.Robotic ground vehicles can be used in a variety of ways. In somecircumstances it may be desirable for the robotic vehicle to travel fromone point to another in minimum time and be oriented in a particulardirection at the final state. Among other applications, this could apply totasks such as remote sensing in a hazardous environment or toneutralization of a detected explosive. An interesting problem in thecontrol of such a robotic ground vehicle is the steering. In this paper amobile robot with frontwheel steering is treated. The problem ofoptimally steering the robot from its initial position and heading to thespecified final position and heading is addressed. First a mathematicalmodel for the mobile robot is required. For the purposes here a thirdorder kinematic model is formulated. This model does not contain theprecision of a model based upon first principles however, it is ofsufficient fidelity to reveal some interesting and important features ofthe optimal trajectories. The performance measure is taken to beelapsed time. Assuming a fixed speed, this corresponds to a path ofminimum distance. It is found that the optimal solution is a trajectorywhich consists of segments of maximumcurvature turns and segmentsof straight lines. The straightline segments are singular arcs. Theproblem is shown to simplify when final heading is free.

A. Parmentola, U.S. ArmyNo abstract available656202, Session 2Passive ultrasonic method for human footstepsdetectionA. E. Ekimov, J. M. Sabatier, The Univ. of MississippiMethods of human detection utilizing lowfrequency seismic signalstypically below a few hundred Hertz from footsteps are well known inthe literature and in a practice.  This frequency band is used for seismicdetectors.  Different walking styles regular, soft and stealthy result indifferent vibration signatures in the lowfrequency range that determinethe maximum ranges for this method of footstep detection.  Forexample, the stealthy walking style was undetectable even a few metersfrom a seismic detector.  Human footsteps generate broadbandfrequency vibrations in the groundfloor and sound in the air from a fewHertz up to ultrasonic frequencies.  The dynamic forces from footstepsthat are normal to the groundfloor are the primary cause of the lowfrequency component in these signals.  Striking and sliding contactsbetween a foot and the groundfloor produce the highfrequencyresponses.  The physical mechanisms involved in the generation of highfrequency signals and the possibility of their application for humanfootstep detection were investigated by the authors A. Ekimov, and J.M.

Neighoff, Johns Hopkins Univ.The ability to automatically detect humans in infrared images hasimportant tactical value in military and civilian applications. Robots andunattended ground stations equipped with realtime human ATRcapability can operate as scouts, perform reconnaissance for militaryunits, and serve to locate humans in remote or hazardous sites. Withthe algorithm proposed in this study, human targets can be detected ininfrared images based on the structure and radiance of the humanhead. The algorithm works in a three step process. First, the infraredimage is segmented primarily based on edges and secondarily basedon intensity of pixels. Once the regions of interest have beendetermined, the segments undergo feature extraction, in which they arecharacterized based on circularity and smoothness. The final step of thealgorithm uses a kth Nearest Neighbor classifier to match the segmentsfeatures to a database, determining whether the segment is a head ornot. This algorithm operates best in environments in which contrastbetween the human and the background is high, such as nighttime orindoors. Tests in a desert environment at nighttime show that themajority of test subjects are detected in the infrared images, with fewfalse positives.656205, Session 2Personnel detection using ground sensorsT.

J. Kozick, Bucknell Univ. B. M. Sadler, Army Research Lab.Multimodal sensor networks are being deployed in military and civilianscenarios where each node contains several sensor modalities, such asacoustic, magnetic, seismic, radar, electrostatic, infrared, optical, andothers. The methods that are used to fuse the data from distinctmodalities has a significant impact on the performance of the sensornetwork for detecting, localizing, tracking, and classifying sources. Wefocus on jointly processing two modalities, acoustic and magnetic, forthe purpose of classifying civilian vehicles such as cars, SUVs, andtrucks.  In this work, the magnetic sensor is a vector magnetometer andthe acoustic sensor is a single microphone, and we assume that thevehicle is moving along a road so that the range to the sensors isknown approximately.For a magnetic source moving with constant velocity, a model for thevector magnetometer output signal is available based on linearcombinations of Anderson functions.  We use this model to develop anovel estimator of the source speed and to reduce the vector magneticdata to 9 parameters.  However, a corresponding parametric model isnot available for the acoustic signal from civilian vehicles.  In addition,models are not known for the joint statistical dependence between themagnetic and acoustic signals.  We address this by usingnonparametric probability density estimation to learn the joint statisticsfrom training data, and then the magneticacoustic data is fused byextracting features for classification that maximize an informationtheoretic criterion.  The magnetic data model and the feature extraction spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 227are described in detail in this paper.  We apply the approach withmeasured magneticacoustic data from civilian vehicles.

We also demonstrate that discrimination isimproved when the features and classifier are combined with additionalinformation about the vehicles track.656208, Session 2Acoustic sensing from smallsize UAVsD.

Cevher, Univ. of MarylandCollege ParkIn this paper, we present a normal approximation for range and speedestimation by a passive acoustic microphone. We use the Laplacianapproximation to demonstrate that the envelope of the microphoneoutput is best modeled with a multiplicative Gaussian noise, when thesource signal and the acoustic microphone noise have uncorrelatedGaussian distributions. We show that our normal approximation predictsthe variance of the envelope measurements correctly and results insignificantly smaller range estimation bias than the additive Gaussianmodel used in the literature. We also prove that the ignorance of themultiplicative noise is a reason for the negatively biased speed estimatesthat are commonly observed and noted in the literature. Using ourmultiplicative model, we analytically derive the receiver operatingcharacteristics for acoustic target detection. We then present the CramerRao bound for target localization in sensor networks.

Worthington, V. Wong, Naval Research Lab.Both the military and consumer sectors are pursuing distributednetworked systems and sensors. A major stumbling block todeployment of these sensors will be the radio frequency RFpropagation environment within a few wavelengths of the earth.Increasing transmit power battery consumption is not a practicalsolution to the problem. This paper will discuss some of the physicalphenomena related to the near earth propagation NEP problem. Whenradiating near the earth the communications link is subjected to a list ofphysical impairments. On the list are the expected Fresnel regionencroachment and multipath reflections. Additionally, radiation patternchanges and near earth boundary layer perturbations exist. A significantamount of data has been collected on NEP. Disturbances in the NEPatmosphere have a time varying attenuation related to the time of dayand these discoveries will be discussed. Solutions, or workarounds, tothe near earth propagation problem hinge on dynamic adaptive RFelements. Adaptive RF elements will allow the distributed sensor todirect energy, beam form, impedance correct, increase communicationefficiency, and decrease battery consumption. Small electricallycontrollable elements are under development to enable antennaimpedance matching in a dynamic environment. Additionally, smalldynamic beam forming antennas are under development to focus RFenergy in the direction of need. By creating provisions for decreasingthe output RF power to the level required, battery consumption can bereduced.

Zhang, College of Staten IslandCUNY M. Chen, BinghamtonUniv.Recently, joint acoustic and video processing has attracted muchattention in target detection and tracking. Video sensors can provideaccurate estimates but have limited field of view and require high powerconsumption.  Acoustic sensors consume low power and can be omnidirectional but have lower accuracy. Fusing data from both modalitieshas the potential to significantly improve tracking performance byexploiting the complementary information. However, it is not easy toefficiently fuse acoustic and video data due to the differences betweenthe two modalities. Current research on joint acousticvideo detectionand tracking has focused on the improvement of tracking performanceby finding efficient fusion strategy. Since reducing the powerconsumption of video sensors is critical for unattended ground wirelesssensor networks, this paper we focus on how to fuse acoustic andvideo information to save energy. A fusion strategy is proposed to helpvideo sensors in reducing the power consumption by incorporating theacoustic tracking results. Simulation results are presented todemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The tradeoff ofpoweraccuracycommunication is discussed.656216, Session 4Integrating pantiltzoom and radar in unattended groundsensor systemsA. Kennedy, B. Jones, R. A. Knobler, R. D.

Srinivasan, InformationSystem Technologies, Inc.Unattended passive acoustic sensors are among the widely usedsensors for remote battlefield surveillance, situation awareness andmonitoring applications. These small and cost effective sensors canprovide realtime information about different types of ground andairborne targets. They are rugged and reliable and can be left in the fieldfor a relatively long period of time after deployment.   Although the ideaof deploying several baseline circular microphone arrays is found to beeffective in detecting and localizing several isolated groups of vehicles,it cannot typically resolve the vehicles within a group when they arespatially very close together. This is due to limited spatial samplingresolution. Additionally, the number of sensors in the array typicallylimits the number of target groups or individual targets that can beresolved using these baseline arrays. Furthermore, these systems arenot cost effective.Distributed sensor networks using inexpensive Zigbeebased motesoffer a new and promising paradigm for detection and localization ofConf. 6562 Unattended Ground, Sea, and Air Sensor Technologies andApplications IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 229vehicles and for military surveillance in general.

DOAs estimatedfrom different clusters of sensor nodes allow us to localize the movingtargets. Wideband geometric averaging Capon beamformer is used toestimate the DOAs at each cluster of nodes every one second.  DOAsestimated from several clusters are subsequently used to estimate thevehicle location using a new maximum likelihoodbased localizationalgorithm.

Aunique property of this implementation of beamspace, namelyrobustness to losses of entire channels of data, has beendemonstrated. This implementation of beamspace to Caponbeamforming also does not require beam orthogonalization, thus savingtremendous computational time, especially in not using the  . 12operator in whitening.656221, Session 5Underwater source localization based on energymeasurement with randomly distributed sensor arrayX. Chen, U. Tureli, Stevens Institute of TechnologyIn this paper, three underwater source location algorithms based onenergy measurement using randomly distributed sensor array areproposed.Compared to the methods based on DOA and TDOA, the energybasedunderwater source localization method has several advantages1,the energy of the source varies slowly with respect to time, theacoustic energy time series can be sampled at a much lower rate .  2,the course time interval for computing energy reduces the burden ofaccurate time synchronization among sensors. 3,it is suitable forunderwater wireless sensor network application due to relatively fewcomputations and consumes little communication  bandwidth and it isalso suitable for the wideband and long duration sources localization. 4,the randomly distributed sensor array is more easily implemented in theunderwater network which has severe bandwidth and energylimitations.An acoustic signal energy attenuation model as a function of sourcetosensor distance is used and independent energy ratio is defined. Firstthe closed form of least square LS and constraint LSCLS formulationfor single source location are derived from the definition of energy ratiobetween different sensor readings.  In two dimensions, we could use 4sensors for LS and only 3 sensors for CLS and in three dimension, werequire 5 sensors for LS and only 4 for CLS. CLS method reduces theminimum required number of sensors by one.  Then, the maximumlikelihood estimation for multiple sources based on energymeasurement is presented and the alternating projection algorithm isapplied to locate the multiple sources. The alternating projectiontransforms the multivariate nonlinear maximization problem into asequence of much simple onedimensional maximization problems.Simulation results based on underwater measurement show that ourlocalization algorithms achieve good performance with computationalefficiency and the performance of CLS is better than LS.656222, Session 5Analysis of the blind source separators ability to performdirection of arrival estimations for multiple sourcesC. Clark, Miltec Corp.The Blind Source Separator BSS is an optimal nonlinear least squaressolution to Direction of Arrival DOA estimations for multiple acousticsources.  The details of the BSS are introduced also, performancestudies are conducted on all aspects of the algorithm. For instance,performance studies are conducted by varying parameters such asfrequency bin selection, microphone spacing, number of sourcespresent, signalto noise ratio SNR, and source separation distances.The BSS algorithm consists of many different factors that contributetowards producing reliable DOA estimations. Some of the mostimportant factors are accurate modeling of the sound wave propagationnear the array, the array configuration, and adequate stopping criteria forproper convergence.  The influence of these factors has been analyzedand their inclusion in the algorithm has been optimized such that thissolution has potential to be an optimal DOA estimator of multiplesources for real time systems.656223, Session 6Loud target suppression an innovative approach toreduce excessive sensor collaboration in distributed UGSsystemsC. A. Stelzig, G. Lipelt, General Dynamics Advanced InformationSystems S. Minor, U.S. Army Night Vision  Electronic SensorsDirectorateEffective management of sensor collaboration is crucial to the successof a distributed unattended ground sensor UGS systems.  A successfulmanagement scheme must allow nodes to share enough information toform and maintain tracks while minimizing unnecessary or excessivecollaboration.  Systems developed with the traditional unidirectional orrequestresponse models are typically susceptible to excessivecollaboration in the presence of a persistent loud sound source.  Thework presented in this paper addresses the challenge of suppressingexcessive sensor collaboration in the presence of loud targets.  TheLoud Target Suppression LTS algorithm utilizes Voronoi tessellation as ameans to allow sensor nodes to autonomously determine alert regionsthat support track formation with neighboring nodes.  By replying onlywith sensor measurements that fall within the alert regions, the LTSalgorithm is able to significantly reduce message quantities withoutimpacting track accuracy.  This paper will demonstrate that an alertbased sensor collaboration scheme, employed by Distributed ClusterManagement DCM, greatly reduces sensor collaboration in thepresence of loud targets which results in a more scalable system.656224, Session 6Layered mode selection logic control for border securityT. E. Born, A. B. Wright, Univ. of ArkansasLittle Rock A. Wright, G.Ferrer, Hendrix CollegeChallenges in border security may be resolved through a team ofautonomous mobile robots configured as a flexible sensor array.  Therobots will have a prearranged formation along a section of a border, andeach robot will always attempt to maintain a uniform distance with itsnearest neighbors. The robots will carry sensor packages which candetect a signature that is representative of a human for instance, athermal signature. When a robot detects a potential border crosser, itwill move away from the crosser such that it attempts to maintain anconstant distance from the crosser and moves away from the border i.e.into its home territory.  As the robot moves away from the border, itsneighbors will move away from the border to maintain a uniform distancewith the moving robot and with their fixed neighbors.  The pattern ofmotion in the team of robots can be identified, either algorithmically by acomputer or by a human monitor of a display.  Unique patterns areindicative of animal movement, human movement, and mass humanmovement. To realize such a scheme, a new control architecture must bedeveloped. This architecture must be fault tolerant to sensor andConf. 6562 Unattended Ground, Sea, and Air Sensor Technologies andApplications IX230 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssmanipulator failures, scalable in number of agents, and adaptable todifferent robotic base platforms for instance, a UGV may beappropriate at the southern border and a UAV may be appropriate atthe northern border.   The Central Arkansas Robotics Consortium hasdeveloped an architecture, called Layered Mode Selection LogicLMSL, which addresses all of these concerns.  The overall LMSLscheme as applied to a multiagent flexible sensor array is described inthis paper.656225, Session 6Role of quality of service metrics in visual targetacquisition and tracking in resourceconstrainedenvironmentsM. Anderson, Univ. of Minnesota P. David, Army Research Lab.Implementation of an intelligent, automated target acquisition andtracking systems alleviates the need for operators to monitor videocontinuously. This system could identify situations that fatiguedoperators could easily miss.If an automated acquisition and tracking system plans motions tomaximize a coverage metric, how does the performance of that systemchange when the user intervenes and manually moves the cameraHow can the operator give input to the system about what is importantand understand how that relates to the overall task balance betweensurveillance and coverageIn this paper, we address these issues by introducing a new formulationof the average linear uncovered length ALUL metric, speciallydesigned for use in surveilling urban environments. This metriccoordinates the often competing goals of acquiring new targets andtracking existing targets. In addition, it provides current systemperformance feedback to system users in terms of the systemstheoretical maximum and minimum performance. We show thesuccessful integration of the algorithm via simulation.656226, Session 6Adaptive polarimetric sensing and processingF. A. Sadjadi, Lockheed Martin Corp.No abstract available656227, Session 6A temporal and spatial fusionbased decision supportsystem for sparse undersea sensor networkB. Ling, Migma Systems, Inc.In a sparse undersea sensor network, the sensor coverage areas areoften nonoverlapping. This type of surveillance network can achieve areasonable target detection accuracy while minimizing the overallsystem cost. Although targets in the surveillance region may not alwaysbe detected, as they move, sensors can collectively detect, classify andtrack them. The traditional instantaneous target detection methods areless effective since, at certain sampling instances, targets may not bedetected by any sensors at all Therefore, operator must evaluate thesensor reports over a period of time. Since it is inevitable for sensors togenerate false reports, over the entire evaluation period, both positiveand false reports coexist, making it difficult, if not impossible, for theoperator visually or computer autonomously to identify the tracks. Toovercome these problems, we have developed new temporal andspatial fusion methods for multiple targets detection and tracking. Anoptimization based fusion method has been developed to fuse spatiallydistributed sensor reports without making any assumptions of theirunderlying statistical distributions. The mathematical morphologicaloperations are used to eliminate the isolated reports, thus, reducing theimpact of random false detections. Our temporal fusion method furtherestimates the target tracks based on kinematic trajectories of movingtargets. The synthetic target tracks are also estimated to provide theoperator with a better view of the surveillance region. Simulation resultshave shown that our system can effectively detect multiple target tracksin a large surveillance region with false detections and sensor drifting.656230, Session 7Acousticseismic signal propagation and sensorperformance modelingD. K. Wilson, U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Ctr.D. H. Marlin, Army Research Lab. S. Mackay, Atmospheric andEnvironmental Research, Inc.Performance, optimal employment, and data processing methods foracoustic and seismic sensors depend strongly on the terrestrialenvironment in which they operate. Software tools for guiding nonexpert users of these sensors are therefore much needed. However,accurate, meaningful predictions require that many individualcomponents be constructed and correctly connected together. Thesecomponents include the source signature and directionality,representation of the atmospheric and terrain environment, calculationof the signal propagation, characterization of the sensor response, andmimicking of the data processing at the sensor. Selection of anappropriate signal propagation model is particularly important, as thereexist key tradeoffs between fidelity and speed. Although mostpropagation modeling focuses on transmission loss attenuation ofsignal energy, it is also important to consider the fading of the signaland, for array systems, variations in wavefront angleofarrival.Regarding the environmental characterization, the strong link is usuallythe availability of highresolution terrain elevation data. Weak links in theenvironmental characterization are the temporalspatial resolution of theatmospheric data, knowledge of the surface and subsurface properties,and data for the environmental background noise. Imperfect knowledgeof the propagation environment is typically a primary source ofuncertainty in the sensor predictions. We illustrate the design ofsoftware tools for acousticseismic sensors with two distinct examplesa detailed sensortotarget calculation called the Sensor PerformanceEvaluator for Battlefield Environments SPEBE, and a largescale,polygon based calculation called Battlefield Terrain Reasoning andAnalysis BTRA.656231, Session 7ARL participation in C4ISR OTM experiment integrationand performance resultsL. Zong, B.

This experiment was designedto examine the effectiveness that advanced C4ISR technologies haveon an Army Future Combat Systems FCSbased Infantry Companyand Reconnaissance Troop.  The experiment included live soldierexercises conducting realistic scenarios, with each soldier beingconnected to a battlefield tactical network.  Also connected to thetactical network was a suite of manned and unmanned sensor assetscontrolled via a cohesive command and control environment.ARLs objective in the exercise was to demonstrate systemlevelintegration of developing technologies for small unit combat operationsaimed at improving situational awareness.  ARL brought expertise inunattended ground sensing technology, wireless mobile adhoccommunication, and information fusion to the experiment.  The ARLC4ISR system included a system of multimodal unattended groundsensors, a tripwire imager, multiple manportable robotic vehiclesPackBots, and an unmanned scoutlightcargo carrying robotic vehicleRGator.  These disparate technologies were integrated into an overallC4ISR system using a combination of proprietary and COTScomponents, and communicated wirelessly using various methods.Users could control the system in a number of ways, via the Force XXIBattle Command, Brigade and Below FBCB2 display suite mounted intactical vehicles HMMWV or via Operator Control Units OCUs carriedby dismounted soldiers.This paper will describe in detail the ARL C4ISR system architecture,various components, and communication technologies.

Rowaihy, The Pennsylvania State Univ.Resiliency of sensor monitoring infrastructure is a key requirement in themilitary context, since at any time one or more sensors may beunavailable.  With enough sensors and careful deployment of sensors,one can provide a  kresilient area. A kresilient, or kcovering  sensordeployment is one in which each point within an area remains sensorobservable even if up to  k1 of the sensors covering a point areunavailable.One solution to the kresiliency placement of sensors can be obtainedby using geometric techniques. A geometric approach attempts tocompletely cover  a sensor field so that every point is sensorcoveredby k sensors using a regular pattern of placements i.e. a grid.  In thispaper we explore a covering based on geometric ideas and alsoexamine coverings when the grid locations are only approximated  Weshow that these results can influence algorithms for selflocomotedsensors to move to better locations than the ones they currentlyoccupy, to aid in proper placement of sensors when one has reasonablecontrol on the placement, and to provide insights into how to placesensors under less than ideal conditions.  Our current investigationshave focused on geometric techniques where k equals 2.  The regularityof our methodology to cover a square area with overlapping sensorcoverage, allows these results to be extended for other geometricconfigurations and to different values of k.656234, Session 7Sensors that report by email system concepts forkeeping costs lowC. J. Brown, Brown Computer Co.Military products are more often designed by engineers than bymarketing people.  When asked to optimize a design for cost, engineerstend to restrict their efforts to the parts they designed rather thanlooking at larger contexts.  By focusing only on those components overwhich one has control, the engineerdesigner will fail to see the largestopportunities for cost reduction.  This paper presents several conceptsfor reducing the total cost of operating a geographically large networkof autonomous sensors and argues that increasing the unit cost for asensor can actually reduce the total cost of operating a sensor system.656235, Session 8Sustained unattended sensor networks stateoftheartchallenges for future ocean and littoral systemsE.

AzimiSadjadi, Information System Technologies, Inc. G. Kiss,B. Fehr, Budapest Univ. of Technology and Economics Hungary. Ldeczi, Vanderbilt Univ. S. Srinivasan, Information SystemTechnologies, Inc. P. Vlgyesi, Vanderbilt Univ.Distributed wireless sensor networks consisting of several singlesensors with different sensing modalities offer numerous importantbenefits for a multitude of military applications including battlefieldsurveillance, situation awareness and monitoring, urban warfare andhomeland security. Among these benefits are simplicity and ease indeployment in battlefield or urban areas, larger coverage area, betterspatial resolution for separating multiple closely spaced targets i.e.vehicles, less hardware complexity and hence significantly lower costs,more flexibility in configuring different dynamic sensor arrayconfigurations, and potential widespread applications in urban warfare,homeland security, industrial monitoring, etc.  However, the widespreadapplication of the Zigbeebased sensor nodes is plagued by severaltechnical challenges namely resource e.g. bandwidth and batterypower constraints, reliability and health of sensors, and moreimportantly computational limitations of the nodes.The computational capabilities of the inexpensive Zigbeebaseddistributed sensor nodes can be enhanced by COTS sensor boards.This gives the nodes the ability to preprocess the captured signals forsensorlevel detection, feature extraction and direction of arrival DOAestimation and hence better utilize the limited resources e.g. batterypower and bandwidth for longterm operations.

Benda, General AtomicsThe concept of sensor networks that can detect intrusions by hostilepersonnel and provide live, real time video of the intrusions to a centrallocation has been circulated for over three decades. While there havebeen permanent installations of continuous surveillance monitors alongsmall sections of the US border and such systems are routinely installedaround high value facilities, these systems are not practical over largeregions.  The ideal sensor network would be covert, have selfcontainedpower, be resistant to false alarms, be low cost, enable wireless datatransfer, and require minimal personnel to operatemonitor.Unfortunately, the technical capability to produce such a sensornetwork has heretofore not existed. The advent of UltraWidebandUWB radiofrequency technology, digital cameras and nightdayimaging technology developed during the telecom boom has changedthis. By combining General Atomics UWB communications and microimpulse radar technology with commercially available microCCD orCMOS cameras, night illuminators, and lithiumion batteries, anunattended sensor network capable of monitoring large 10  2000 kmclass perimeters has been developed.656204, Session 9New seismic unattended smallsize module for footstep,and light and heavy vehicle detection and identificationE.

Watson Research Ctr.Phenomenon or event detection is central element to a broad class ofsensorbased applications in both civilian and military settings, forexample in detecting the presence of aircrafts, hostile activities e.g.,explosions, studying threshold crossing e.g., temperature, and so on.Upon determining the occurrence of a phenomenon, a decision makermay take corrective actions to remedy a situation, e.g., activate the firesuppression sprinkler system, andor trigger followon processes, e.g.,sound the fire alarm. Thus, the quality of detection, and more generallythe quality of information, supplied to a decision maker by a detectionprocess is of high importance that directly influences the effectivenessof the decision making process.The quality of information QoI achieved by detection processes is anobjective of our ongoing research where we investigate the tradeoffsbetween the various attributes that influence QoI. Specifically, in thispaper we present a set of attributes that are being proposed tocharacterize QoI in a domainagnostic manner. We then focus on twoimportant of these attributes, timeliness and data reliability, whichcapture the quality of detection processes with respect to how fast andConf. 6562 Unattended Ground, Sea, and Air Sensor Technologies andApplications IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 233how accurately a detection is made. With special emphasis on transientphenomena, i.e., phenomena of limited duration, using traditionalBayesianbased hypothesis testing techniques, we investigate thedetection of these phenomena and we analytically derive relationshipsthat capture the QoI of a phenomenon detector as a function of theduration of the observed phenomena and the rate with whichobservations of the phenomena are collected.656244, Session 9Acoustic classification of battlefield transient eventsusing wavelet subband featuresM. R. AzimiSadjadi, Colorado State Univ. S. Srinivasan,Information System Technologies, Inc.Collaborative distributed sensor networks offer a new and promisingparadigm for military surveillance, reconnaissance and situationawareness for the military operations in urban terrain MOUT.Generally, there can be wide variety of transient events in the battlefielddepending on the specific mission like artillery fires, mortar fires, smallarms fires, etc.  The highly nonstationary nature of the transient signalsmakes the extraction of representative features a challenging task. Thisis compounded by the variations in the environmental and operatingconditions and existence of a wide range of possible battlefield andMOUT transient events with perhaps overlapping features.  Theextraction of a salient feature set and the design of a robustclassification system are the goals of this transient classificationproblem.There are numerous acoustic sound sources on the battlefield and inMOUT environments that interfere with the transients of interest.  First,the transient signal of interest is extracted using an MLbased transientsignal estimation and restoration algorithm.  The estimated transientsignals are represented using wavelets, which provide an idealframework to represent the transient signals because of its optimalmultiresolution timescale properties.  The multiresolution property ofthe wavelet allows for capturing fine details or subtleties in the transientsignals that can be used to successfully classify them.  Wavelet subband higher order moment and energybased features are used tocharacterize the transient signals.  The discrimination ability andimportance of each individual subband for transient signalclassification is studied on several different gunshots and mortar fires.Important findings and observations on these results are outlined in thispaper.656245, Session 10DARPA NetCentric radio demonstrationsL. B. Stotts, Defense Advanced Research Projects AgencyThis paper describes a novel autonomously adaptive networked radiosystem that provides a broadband tactical mobile backbone to enablenetcentric warfare. The system was successfully demonstrated toseamlessly interconnect multiple heterogeneous networked radiosystems during the DARPA NetCentric NC demonstration at Ft.Benning, GA in January 2006, serving as the high availability terrestrialbackbone link between dismount units that were otherwise beyondcommunications range. Realtime tactical voice, video, and situationawareness SA data were reliably delivered over the network to supportthe planning and execution of a simulated tactical mission with all radionetwork operation conducted by active duty US military personnel.Each NC node operated as a vehicular or airborne relay mobile adhocrouter for the terrestrial backbone tactical network. Routing in eachground vehicle selected between this terrestrial backbone path and analternate satellite backbone for assured lineofsight LoS and beyondlineofsight BLoS communications.The broadband mobile adhoc radio system incorporates manyinnovative networking features to deliver breakthrough capabilities.Multiple discontiguous 1.2 MHz wide bandwidth segments areaggregated into a single RF waveform to ease frequency planning incrowded UHF spectrum bands. The system provides both high datarate and long range communications by autonomously adapting eachlink in the adhoc network topology to deliver the maximum possiblethroughput under dynamically changing link conditions. Prioritizeddelivery of timesensitive and high value traffic is achieved throughnovel Quality of Service QoS mechanisms implemented in both theMAC and Network layers to ensure that the most important traffic isdelivered during periods of network congestion. The reliableautonomous adaptation of the networked radio allows warfighters tofocus on external events during tactical maneuvers without having toworry about communications connectivity.656246, Session 11Selfhealing routing a study in efficiency and resiliencyof data delivery in wireless sensor networksK. Wasilewski, J. W. Branch, M. W. Lisee, B. Szymanski, RensselaerPolytechnic InstituteThis paper presents the results of implementation of a novel protocol,SelfHealing Routing SHR for opportunistic multihop wirelesscommunication, on Crossbow Motes. The protocol uses broadcastcommunication and a prioritized slotted transmission backoff delayscheme to empower a receiving node to use its hop distance from thedestination to decide autonomously whether to forward a packet. Thisenables dynamic traversal of the shortest routes without requiringnodes to decide explicitly to which neighbors to forward packets. Whensevered routes are encountered, the protocol dynamically and locallyreroutes packets so they traverse the surviving shortest route. This alsomakes SHR a natural complement for energyefficient topology controlalgorithms that control radio power states.We have implemented this protocol on a set of Crossbow Motes andconducted field testing with the motes placed at ground level withlimited radio range and above ground that gives them larger radiocommunication range and therefore increases the density of the motesplacement over the same field of deployment. We also tested scenarioswith the motes either turned off modeling destroyed ones or coveredwith a metal screen to prevent radio contact modeling temporalunavailability. All these tests show the effects of a mote going off linetemporarily and permanently.The results, as shown by experimental measurement data reported inthe paper, demonstrate that SelfHealing Routing is an efficient faulttolerant protocol that performs well even with spontaneous networktopology changes.656247, Session 11Simulation of sensor networks using message queueinfrastructureD. C. Verma, IBM Thomas J.

One possible approach to obtainscalable simulation is by using commercially available messagingsystems. Such messaging systems, e.g. IBM MQ system or OSMQ, aredesigned  to operate at a very high bandwidth of message transfers rateand number of interacting message queue endpoints. However, thecommunications abstractions offered by message queue systems arevery different from the communications abstractions required by sensornetworks.In this paper, we describe an approach to map the communicationabstractions of sensor network simulation systems to those ofunderlying message queue systems.

Cornelissen, Boston MicromachinesCorp. T. G. Bifano, Boston Univ.With an evergrowing number of remote sensor applications in thedefense industry and an emerging demand in the private sector,technology used to query and communicate with remote sensors mustprogress accordingly.  Many remote sensing applications requiresecure, covert sensor communication and long battery operation times.Omnidirectional sources such as RF transmitters are not viable giventheir high power consumption and low stealth level.   Laser transmittersare an attractive solution but are limited in their tradeoff betweencommunication range and power consumption.  To meet both theneeds of ultralow power and secure communication, we aredeveloping a new communication technology.  The SecureCommunicating Optical Ultralight Transponder SCOUT employs anunprecedented design that combines a deformable mirror made usingmicroelectromechanical system MEMS processes with a conventionalhollow glass retroreflector.  This device works by reflecting anillumination beam to its point of origin and modulating the incominglight to create a communication signal.  The system benefits from twoinherent characteristics 1. No pointing or tracking subsystems areneeded to establish a link to the source, and 2. no onboard lasertransmission power is required.  The strength of the return beam isdirectly proportional to the strength of the sending beam.  Militaryapplications include biological and chemical gas detection, laser remotesensing for surveillance, and land and air based situational awarenessand force protection.  This paper will describe the design anddevelopment of SCOUT, and will show initial performance results.656251, Session 12TBD, ArmyNo abstract available656252, Session 12TBD, MarinesNo abstract available656253, Session 12TBD, NavyNo abstract available656254, Session 12TBD, INSCOMNo abstract available656255, Session 12TBD, INSCOMNo abstract available656256, Session 12TBD, DHSNo abstract availableConf. 6562 Unattended Ground, Sea, and Air Sensor Technologies andApplications IX spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 235Conf. 6563 Evolutionary and Bioinspired Computation Theory andApplicationsThursdayFriday 1213 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6563 Evolutionary and BioInspired Computation Theoryand Applications656301, Session 1Biologically inspired models for swarmingE.

Ghose, T. K. Horiuchi,P. S. Krishnaprasad, and C. F. Moss and colleagues on insect pursuitby echolocating bats.  In work of F. Zhang, E. W. Justh, and P.

Building on this earlier work, weseek to identify a bioinspired framework for cooperative swarming, inwhich the apparently complicated trajectories of individuals areexplained by feedback laws which take a relatively simple form.  Theobjectives of such swarming e.g., for teams of unmanned vehiclescould include rendezvous, target capture or destruction, andcooperative sensing.656302, Session 1Evolving behaviors in search and tracking problemsG. A. Vilches, A. S. Wu, Univ. of Central Florida J. C. Sciortino, Jr.,Naval Research Lab. D. J. Pack, U.S. Air Force Academy J. P.Ridder, Innovating Systems, Inc.This work investigates the use of evolutionary computation in learninghow to evolve goal priorities for a team of cooperating agents. Our goalpriorities are trained to generate candidate parameter solutions for asearch and tracking problem in an emittersensor scenario. We identifyand isolate several behaviors that evolve to solve one or both tasksubsets. We also explore how quantity of emitters or sensors affect thecapability to train for these behaviors and the performance outcome,isolate the types of goal vector parameters that contribute to them, andcategorize the limitations from those parameters in these scenarios.Studies indicate that social interaction can improve team performancein a variety of training simulations. We examine how the behaviorsidentified above are affected by distribution of limited, localized socialinteraction and hypothesize that the localized communications willimprove the overall capability at solving the task.656303, Session 1Developing AEA systemofsystems mission plans with amultiobjective genetic algorithmJ. C. HandUber, Dynamic Analytics and Test, Inc. J. P. Ridder,Innovating Systems, Inc.The role of the airborne electronic attack AEA systemofsystems is toincrease the survivability of friendly aircraft through jamming of hostileair defense radars.  However, AEA systems are scarce, highdemandassets and have limited resources with which to engage a potentiallylarge number of emitters.  Given the limited resources, it is a significantchallenge to plan their employment and to manage these in such a wayas to achieve the desired result  the survival of friendly aircraft.  Plansrequire specification of the geographic locations of jammer platforms,as well as the mix of wide and narrowband jamming assignmentsmatched to particular radar targets.  Further, the environment isuncertain as to the precise locations, numbers, and emissionsbehaviors of the radars.  Therefore, we require plans that are not onlycapable, but also robust to the expected variability of the environment,and ultimately flexible for adaptation to larger variations.  In this paper,we use a multiobjective genetic algorithm  the Dynamic Nondominated Sorting GA DNSGA  to develop capable and robust AEAmission plans.  The algorithm seeks to determine the Paretofront ofthree objectives  maximize the operational objectives achieved byfriendly aircraft, minimize the threat to friendly aircraft, and minimize theexpenditure of AEA assets.  The results show that this algorithm is ableto provide planners with the quantitative information necessary tointelligently construct capable and robust mission plans for the AEAsystemofsystems.656304, Session 1Genetic algorithms to find solutions to the minimumVoronoi classifier coverage problemJ.

Soule, Univ. of IdahoThere is considerable interest in developing teams of autonomous,unmanned vehicles that can function in hostile environments withoutendangering human lives.  However, heterogeneous teams, teams ofunits with specialized roles andor specialized capabilities, havereceived relatively little attention.  Specialized roles and capabilities cansignificantly increase team effectiveness and efficiency.  Unfortunately,developing effective cooperation mechanisms is much more difficult inheterogeneous teams.  Units with specialized roles or capabilitiesrequire specialized software that take into account the role andcapabilities of both itself and its neighbors.  E.g. when a unit is lost, theother units must take into account the role of the lost unit and their ownrole and capabilities before deciding how to adjust their behavior.Evolutionary algorithms, algorithms modeled on the principles of naturalselection, have a proven track record in generating successful teams.However, using classification problems as a prototype, we have shownthat typical evolutionary algorithms either generate highly effectiveteams members that cooperate poorly or poorly performing individualsthat cooperate well.  To overcome these weaknesses we havedeveloped a novel class of evolutionary algorithms.  In this paper weapply these algorithms to the problem of controlling simulated,heterogeneous teams units are scouts or investigators.  Our testproblem requires producing a map of an area and to further investigateareas of interest.  Loss of units, either through hostile actions ormechanical failure, is possible, and only limited communication isallowed. We compare several evolutionary algorithms for their ability togenerate individually effective members and high levels of cooperation.656306, Session 2Using a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for theairman assignment problemM. P. Kleeman, G. B. Lamont, Air Force Institute of TechnologyThe Air Force has been mandated to cut their military personneldrastically by 2009.  With these forced cutbacks, many of the currentprocesses need to be streamlined and become more efficient.  In thispaper, we present a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm MOEA thatcould be used by the Air Force Personnel Center AFPC to moreefficiently determine military assignments.  Specifically the paperfocuses on maximizing two objectives  minimizing moving costs andminimizing any assignment penalties generated by the algorithm.  The236 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsscomplexity of the problem is increased due to the number of hardconstraints that must be met before a solution is considered valid.  Thepaper is divided into three sections.The first section describes the problem domain and compares thisassignment problem with others that have been previously researched.The assignment problem is categorized into the more generalconstrained assignment problem CAP.  The best practices of thesecommon problems are discussed and applied to our problem.After the problem is fully discussed, the second section describes thealgorithm that is applied to the problem.  The evolutionary operators arepresented and the reason why these operators were implemented isdiscussed.  Other algorithm parameters and settings, as well as thecomputing environment are discussed in this section.The third section discusses the results.  The paper uses standardMOEA metrics and uses timing information to show how quickly thealgorithm generates valid solutions.  Using Pareto analysis, the paperillustrates how the algorithm progresses toward the optimal solutions.A discussion of the results is presented and opportunities for futurework are addressed.656307, Session 2Modeling and predicting abstract concept or ideaintroduction and propagation through geopoliticalgroupsH.

Sciortino, Jr., NavalResearch Lab.Modern air defense systems include emitters that are characterized bytheir low peak power, low sidelobes, and short emission times.  Oneapproach to finding these is to employ multiple small UAVs that activelysearch an area of interest.  The target search environment may bepartially known, but with a significant level of uncertainty as to specificemitters, their locations, and their emissions behavior.  Therefore, thesearch effectiveness of the UAVs is likely to be strongly influenced bythe particular algorithms they employ.  These algorithms can generallybe characterized by the area they cover and their revisit rate to aparticular point.  In addition, intelligent algorithms will use environmentalperception and interactions with other UAVs to dynamically guide theirsearch.  In this paper we use a multiobjective genetic algorithmMOGA to explore the desirable characteristics of the search algorithmsand numbers of UAVs necessary to conduct a search for a set of airdefense scenarios that vary in terms of numbers and locationuncertainty of target emitters.  This algorithm seeks to determine theParetofront of two objectives  maximize search performancemeasured by the ratio of detections to detection opportunities andminimize cost measured by the number of UAVs.  This work will helplay the foundation for development of intelligent search algorithms, andwill also serve as the basis for a planning component that determinesthe initial search characteristics of small UAVs for particular missions.656310, Session 3Optimizing a search strategy for multiple mobile agentsA. S. Wu, Univ. of Central Florida P. Lima, U.S. Air Force AcademyJ. C. Sciortino, Jr., Naval Research Lab. D. J. Pack, U.S. Air ForceAcademyIn this paper, we propose a rulebased search method for multiplemobile distributed agents, seekers, to cooperatively search an area formobile target detection.  The collective goals of the seekers are 1 tomaximize the coverage of a search area without explicit coordinationamong the members of the group, 2 to increase the unpredictability ofthe search pattern of individual seeker, and 3 to improve the averagevisit frequency rate for all locations within a search area.  We assumethat the search space contains multiple mobile targets and each seekeris equipped with a Global Positioning System GPS and a rudimentarysensor with a limited range.  We also assume that each seeker has alimited communication range and can only communicate with nearbyseekers.  We envision the proposed search method to be applicable tocooperative mobile robots, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs, andUnmanned Underwater VehiclesUUVs.  The final rules used by eachseeker is developed by an evolutionary algorithm based process wherethe mobility decision of a seeker at each time incident is independentlymade as a function of the direction of the previous motion of the seeker,the known locations of other seekers, the distance of the agent to theboundaries of the search area, the agents knowledge of the areaalready covered by the group, and the desire to generate randomsearch patterns.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposedsearch method in multiple scenarios with varying number of seekersand targets.  We also show the generality and the scalability of theproposed method.656311, Session 3Swarming UAVs mission design strategyK.

ODonnell, Air Force Research Lab.Simple genetic algorithm optimizations often utilize fixedlengthchromosomes containing a predefined set of parameters to beoptimized.  While such algorithms have successfully createdelectricallysmall narrowband and large wideband military antennas,they require the antenna designer to have a fairly concrete antennarepresentation apriori to the genetic algorithm.  In this research, weinvestigate the use of genetic programming GP techniques toprogram the design of a simple thinwire antennas.  Geneticprogramming techniques offer the potential to create random, multiarm, multidimension antennas from variable length, treelikechromosomes.  We compare and contrast several GPdesigned thinwire antennas to antennas created previous by simple geneticalgorithms, discussing the pros and cons of these techniques.656315, Session 5Application of evolutionary algorithms and neuralnetwork concepts to the design of lowcost, widebandantenna arraysS.

Lamont, Air Force Instituteof Technology F. W. Moore, Univ. of Alaska AnchorageMilitary imaging systems often require the transmission of copiousamounts of data in noisy or bandwidthlimited situations.  High rates oflossy image compression may be achieved through the use ofquantization at the expense of resulting image quality.  We employgenetic algorithms GAs to evolve militarygrade transforms capable ofimproving reconstruction of satellite reconnaissance images underconditions subject to quantization error.  The resulting transformsoutperform existing wavelet transforms at a given compression ratioallowing transmission of data at a lower bandwidth.  Because GAs arenotoriously difficult to tune, the selection of appropriate variationoperators is critical when designing GAs for militarygrade algorithmdevelopment.  We test several stateoftheart realcoded crossoverand mutation operators to develop an evolutionary system capable ofproducing transforms providing robust performance over a set of fiftysatellite images of military interest.  The evolved filters consistentlyprovide an average mean squared error MSE reduction greater than15 over the original wavelet transform across all images.  Applicationof a general pattern search GPS algorithm provides additional localrefinement to evolved transforms.  By improving image quality, evolvedtransforms increase the amount of intelligence that may be obtainedreconstructed images.656318, Session 6Using a multiagent evidential reasoning network as theobjective function for an evolutionary algorithmR. S. Woodley, C. M. Gore, E. R. Lindahl, 21st Century Systems, Inc.Exhaustive search is often infeasible and many real world problems offerno objective measures of solution quality, preventing the discovery ofsolutions.  We have combined evolutionary algorithms EA with theevidential reasoning network ERN, a new concept in evidentialreasoning that serves as the EAs objective function.  This allows for afusion of beliefs and opinions to guide the evolutionary force actingupon the possible solutions instead of a single quality metric, allowingus to approach problems that simultaneously require incomplete searchmethods and lack any single overall metric of solution quality.ERN integrates the decisions of people and software using subjectivelogic, explicitly accounting for trust and pedigree.  ERN provides anormalization layer for integrating evidence characterizers and classifierswith human opinions.  ERN allows for finetuning of trust for disparateexperts and tuning of classifiers, allowing for largescale sensor andevidential fusion integration.We apply our approach to battlefield stress calculations and identifyingthe optimal makeup of fighting units, a problem whose metrics are illdefined and subjective, further complicated by the human commanderswho have unit preferences.  Our approach can account for the disparateinformation and calculate a nearoptimal troop makeup.  We simplifythe description of a good solution with ERN, which the EA explores todiscover those good solutions.  This approach is applicable to realworldproblems where even defining a cost function is difficult, with the addedfeature that human intuition and subject expertise combine with theability of computers to find good solutions.656319, Session 6Optimizing the usage of computer servers with a hybridgenetic algorithmD.

My worksuggests that these connections implement dynamic networks whereactivation projects to the processing cells which then feeds back andinhibit the inputs.  Multiple such circuits can be intermeshed to performrecognition.Such circuits resolve combinatorial problems the maximal number ofconnections demanded by the network depends only on the number ofinputs a cell has.  A cell does not require a connection to each cell itmay potentially compete with, reducing computational complexity.Within the feedback network, the degree of input feature overlapbetween a pair of representations defines the degree of competitionbetween them.  An increase in the similarity between two objects leadsto the increase in the computational demand, resources needed, andtime needed to distinguish between them.  This correlates with humanreaction time data.Conf. 6563 Evolutionary and Bioinspired Computation Theory andApplications238 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssFurthermore, when presented with multiple representations this networkprefers the broadest representations with the least amount of interrepresentation overlap, which elegantly addresses binding problems.Even though nonlinear, recurrent feedback networks are well suited forthe search task, are combinatorially plausible, allow the best fit ofmultiple representations, touch on the binding problem, and aresupported by brain neurophysiology and neuroanatomy.656321, Session 6Data mining approach for analysis of a coevolutionarySASO simulationL. Suantak, J. W. Rozenblit, F. Momen, The Univ. of ArizonaAs modern military simulation systems develop in complexity and striveto incorporate greater numbers of finegrained data sources, analystsare turning to databases to collect, organize and make sense of thelarge volumes of data that are generated. Decision support tools thatuse evolutionary algorithms to search very large solution spaces alsobenefit from the power and flexibility of analysis employing data miningtechniques. This paper describes our approach to performing patternanalysis and trend discovery using databases on Sheherazade, a multisided genetic algorithm based course of action COA genereator thatsupports Stability and Support Operations SASO. The Sheherazadesystem models the impact of the characteristic SASO parameters suchas regional attitudes, population density etc., as well as conventionanand nonconventional forces such as military, terrorist, apolitical noncombatant, information operators etc. on the mission success ofvarious factions including the peacekeeping force. The COAs that aregenerated are visualized on a 3dimensional platform supported by arange of analysis tools and displays. By populating a database with theoutput of many simulation runs, aggregate queries that yield statisticalresults becomes possible, providing insight into overall trends in thesimulation that are difficult or impossible to observe by examiningindividual COAs.

L. Rapanotti, R. Farinaccio, P. Gosselin, R. Pimentel, A. Schfke,Defence RD CanadaValcartier CanadaFluctuations and rapid transients in rocket plume signatures have asignificant affect on the performance of threat detection algorithms.Some of the phenomena, caused by interaction of turbulent exhaustwith the atmosphere, pressure fluctuations in the motor andinhomogeneity of atmosphere composition, for example in thedistribution of ozone, can be modelled by solving the radiation transferequations over ensembles of the composition.  These ensembles arestatistically equivalent to temporal Probability Density Functions PDFwhen the signature is at steady state. Slower transients can also bemodelled when the average is orders of magnitude slower than thefluctuations. In this study, ensembles are derived from experimentaldata or calculated by solving a composition PDF transport equation.Preliminary results suggests that this approach can be useful indeveloping hybrid sensors for threat detection and missile guidanceoptics.656402, Session 1Modeling surveillance systems with metamodelsM.

This simulation is a collection of customizedsoftware tools that permits design engineers to vary the instrumentparameters and configurations and to assess the resulting instrumentperformance under realistic onorbit scenarios. Atmospheric andoceanic environment and satellite to earth geometry are used tosimulate active and passive microwave measurements.

The LiteSite Toolkitmitigates voids in DEMs via two novel techniques.  The LiteSite Toolkituses both a nonlinear and stochastic based inpainting technique toaccurately fill in voids.  The nonlinear technique has its origin in fluiddynamics and heat equations partial differential equations.  Thestochastic technique has its origin in texture analysis and exemplarbased processing.  Each technique is optimally suited for different inputconditions.  The fluid dynamics based solution works better for areasrequiring high accuracy where the area to be inpainted does not havedisproportionately high frequency data in a neighborhood of theboundary of the void.  The exemplar based technique is better suitedfor high frequency areas. Both are autonomous with respect todetecting and repairing void regions in disparate data sets.

D. Teichgraeber, Lockheed Martin Corp.In many PCbased simulations, message passing is commonly used fortransfer of dynamic data between software models.  Parameterdefinition andor initialization are typically handled differently and maysuffer because that data is not transferred to all the required models atany time during a simulation run.  Instead multiple and often dissimilarinitializations of the same parameters occur in various softwaremodules, much to the chagrin of the configuration control personneland test engineers.  Results from using this approach can beparticularly damaging for navigation sensor simulations such as a GPSaided inertial mode and for flight program software evaluation andvalidation, where extreme accuracy of results is required.The paper proposes solutions to prevent parameter data mismatch andor compromise.  These solutions are based upon doing a thorough jobof critical parameter definition and initialization, given the simulationcomputer architecture.  The solutions are discussed and explained.Included are descriptions of actual cases  examples of parametermismatch within medium to large scale avionic simulations whereaccuracy was critical to performance evaluation.

Schum, G. Boyarko, J. McCarty, Air Force Research Lab.The Air Force Research Laboratory AFRL has an increasing reliance onModeling and Simulation MS to assess cost, risk, and performanceof their space vehicle research.  One of the most challenging aspects ofmodeling and simulation, especially for the military, is the time requiredto design, develop, and test a simulation.  To further complicate theproblem, military programs are typically operating under very tighttimelines and limited resources.  As a result, high fidelity, integratedsimulations often are not given sufficient diligence to fully validate theirresults.  Conversely, when the development teams do take the time tofollow stateoftheart software development practices, the end usershave often already made their decisions based on rapidly developedquickturn analyses.  Because of the risk and associated cost of spaceflight experiments and the stringent timelines imposed by launch dates,the space community is steadily increasing their reliance on modelingand simulation.  This brings the dilemma of largescale integratedsimulation vs. quickturn analyses to the forefront of space vehicleprogram management.    This paper will discuss the typical processmost simulation teams use to develop and vet their tools, and comparethe relative value of quickturn analyses done with commercial off theshelf COTS and government off the shelf GOTS tools.  Activeresearch in this area includes simulation processes for linking but notintegrating simulations of varying fidelities.  The data supporting thispaper will result from a series of analyses that range from shortduration, mathematical analyses to engineeringlevel systemsimulations, and larger systemofsystems tools.  A brief discussion willbe presented explaining how managers of large, complex technicalprograms can benefit by using both quickturn analyses and integratedsystem simulations.656408, Session 2Using ontology comparison methods for simulationcompositionM. S. Patki, P. C. Benjamin, R. Mayer, Knowledge Based Systems,Inc.Knowledge acquisitiondiscovery, ontology management, knowledgerepresentation and knowledge sharing are key issues in ontologyresearch. This paper focuses on the issue of ontology management andanalysis to facilitate reusability of a simulation components based onontology comparisons. This paper describes novel ontologycomparison methods for componentbased simulation composition.We describe four independent approaches for ontology comparisonterminologybased, featurebased, semantic, and topological.  A datafusion based approach is used to integrate the information from thesefour techniques into a single similarity score. The assignment of suchsimilarity scores is demonstrated using ontology examples from variousdomains. In addition to assessing the similarity, simulationcomposability requires identification of potential mismatches before twocomponent models can be integrated. We categorize mismatches intotwo primary typeslanguagelevel mismatch and ontologylevelmismatch. Each of these are further categorized based on the nature ofthe mismatch. A comprehensive approach is developed forquantification of such mismatches.  Finally, we outline simulationcomposition application scenarios that demonstrate the practicalbenefits of this research.656409, Session 3An adversary prediction environment based on DSAPcapabilitiesM.

C. Schricker, ATT Government Solutions, Inc. L. Ford, IconSystems, Inc.For a number of decades, among the most prevalent training media inthe military has been Tactical Engagement Simulation TES training.TES has allowed troops to train for practical missions in highly realisticcombat environments without the associated risks involved with liveweaponry and munitions.  This has been possible because current TEShas relied largely upon the Multiple Integrated Laser EngagementSystem MILES and similar systems for a number of years for directfireweapons, using a laser to pair the shooter to the potential targets.Emerging systems, on the other hand, will use a pairing method calledgeometric pairing geopairing, which uses a set of data about both theshooter and target, such as locations, weapon orientations, velocities,and weapon projectile velocities, nearby terrain to resolve anengagement.  A previous paper 1 introduces various potential sourcesof error for a geopairing solution.

Valinski, RAM Labs.RAM Laboratories is developing a more advanced realtime updatecapability for both the predictive and stateestimation features of itsDynamic Situational Awareness and Predictive Framework and itsunderlying Multiple Replication Framework in support of the Air ForceResearch Laboratorys Joint Synthetic Environment for Research andDevelopment. The overall goal of the DSAP Infrastructure is to allowCommanders and their staff at Air Operations Centers the ability toperform whatif analysis of plans and alternatives onthefly whilecontinually augmenting the realtime picture sensor inputs withsimulated stateestimated assessments.This paper will discuss design and implementation efforts to provide aDynamic Situational Awareness capability utilizing embeddedsimulations calibrated by realtime C4I inputs to estimate the state ofunobservable elements of an operational picture. Specifically this paperwill discuss enhancements via a Calibrated Realtime Simulationcomponent, a realtime simulation component along with the processfor providing realtime updates to running simulations. The effort willalso discuss the development of DSAP components that allow theinfrastructure to connect to webbased data sources including TBoneto extract track information. Additionally, this paper will discus stepsbeing taken to host the DSAP environment in an exercise or liveexperimental environment.656412, Session 3Building and analyzing timed influence net models withinternetenabled pythiaP. W. Pachowicz, L. W. Wagenhals, J. Pham, A. H. Levis, GeorgeMason Univ.Timed influence nets have been used for course of action development,evaluation and selection in the context of effects based planning. Asoftware implementation of this Bayesian Net modeling techniquenamed Pythia has existed in stand alone mode and has been used inseveral case studies where the value of the tool and its underlyingmodeling and analysis technique has been demonstrated. As thesoftware has matured, it became apparent that it will be more effectiveif it were to be used in a distributed testbed as part of a suit of tools forbehavioral influence analysis.   Consequently, the next version of theapplication, Pythia 1.5, was developed and brought into the stateoftheart clientserver computing environment. Pythia 1.5 is a serverapplication for multiuser and multiprocess computing. This servercentric application relies on the Citrix Presentation Server forintegration, security and maintenance. Only the server computingpower and the number of Citrix licenses limits the number of Pythiaprocesses that can be open concurrently. While Pythias process is runon a server, the inputoutput services are controlled and displayedthrough a client PC. Individual users need to obtain an account, install afree Citrix Presentation Server Client Component, and install a clientGUI. A web interface of the Citrix Presentation Server also allows usersto login to the system and activate Pythia through any web browser.Current efforts on Pythia are focused on 1 a crossapplicationinterfacing through model and data exchange mechanisms, and 2 itsintegration with an application suit of analyst tools. This version allowsdiverse users to develop models and maintain their own data baseswhile the developer can continue to enhance the capabilities of the tool.The use of Pythia will be illustrated through its application to a specificproblem concerning suppression of IED activity in an Iraqi province.The case study demonstrates how analysts can create executableprobabilistic models that link potential actions to effects, based onknowledge about the cultural and social environment.  Both the tool andthe process for creating and analyzing the model are described as wellas the benefits of using the new server based version of the tool.656413, Session 4Evolution of live training by the implementation of anelectronic bulletD. L. Fisher, J. Mann, T. Sherrill, M. Kraus, J. Lyons, A. York, AppliedResearch Associates, Inc.In live forceonforce direct fire training, simulated munitions are usedinstead of live munitions. Simulated munitions are typically modeledusing laser systems such as the Multiple Integrated Laser EngagementSystem MILES. Replacing the laser with an electronic message alsoknown as an electronic bullet or ebullet sent over a network isbecoming feasible due to advances in sensors, communications, andcomputing. The ebullet engagement methodology uses weaponlocation, orientation, and adjudication algorithms. Technical challengesin implementation include having accurate weapon and target locationand orientation, network bandwidth, and terrain database resolution.This paper discusses issues and challenges using an ebullet and laserebullet hybrids for delivery accuracy and damage assessment. We willalso present an engagement methodology robust enough to evolve withadvances in technology.656414, Session 4Architecture for an integrated realtime air combat andsensor network simulationE. A. Criswell, J. A. Rushing, H. Lin, S. J. Graves, The Univ. ofAlabamaHuntsvilleAn architecture for an integrated air combat and sensor networksimulation is presented.  The architecture ties together twocomponents a parallel realtime sensor fusion and target trackingsimulation, and an air combat simulation. By integrating these twosimulations, it becomes possible to experiment with scenarios in whichone or both sides have very large numbers of primitive passive sensors,and to assess the likely effects of those sensors on the outcome of thebattle. Modern Air Power is a realtime theaterlevel air combatsimulation that is currently being used as a part of the USAF Air andSpace Basic Course ASBC. The simulation includes a variety ofscenarios from the Vietnam war to the present day, and also includesseveral hypothetical future scenarios. Modern Air Power includes ascenario editor, an order of battle editor, and full AI customizationfeatures that make it possible to quickly construct scenarios for anyconflict of interest. The scenario editor makes it possible to place awide variety of sensors including both high fidelity sensors such asradars, and primitive passive sensors that provide only very limitedinformation. The parallel realtime sensor network simulation is capableof handling very large numbers of sensors on a computing cluster ofmodest size. It can fuse information provided by disparate sensors todetect and track targets, and produce target tracks.656415, Session 4Applied cognition and training research to addressemerging military requirementsD. M. Nicholson, L. Davis, C. M. Fidopiastis, Univ. of Central FloridaModeling, Simulation and Training MST technologies have providedsignificant capabilities for Military training and mission rehearsal.However, most of the stateoftheart MST systems used today arehigh fidelity, stand alone systems, routinely staffed by a team of supportand instructional personnel.  As the military becomes more reliant onthese technologies to support ever changing concepts of operations,they are asking for numerous technological advancements including 1automated instructional features to reduce the number of personnelrequired for exercises, 2 increased capability for adaptation of humancomputer interfaces to support individual differences and embeddedperformance support in operational settings, and 3 a continuum of lowto high fidelity system components to provide embedded, deployableand transportable solutions.  A multidisciplinary team of researchers atthe University of Central Floridas UCF Institute for Simulation andTraining IST Applied Cognition and Training in Immersive VirtualEnvironments Lab ACTIVE, lead by Dr. Denise Nicholson, is performingConf. 6564 Modeling and Simulation for Military Operations II242 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssresearch and development to address these emerging requirements aspart of ongoing projects for Navy, Marine Corps and Army customers.In this paper we will discuss 1 designs for the use of agent technologyto provide automated instructional support, 2 the use of our noninvasive, portable, Operational Neuroscience Sensing Suite whichincludes eyetracking, EEG, fNIR and ECGIBI for advancedindividualized performance measurement to drive future adaptivesystems and 3 our prototype multifidelity MST tested which is beingused to evaluate the effectiveness of laptop, portable and transportablesystems to provide the reality  required to train various Marine Corpsskills.656417, Session 5Toward fully automated 3D scene reconstruction usingdecisionlevel fusion of remotely sensed dataM. C. Tarnowski, D. Warnaar, Applied Research Associates, Inc.Improvements in remote sensing technology for the collection of highresolution aerial lidar and hyperspectal data of urban landscapes havelead to increasing interest in rapid scene reconstruction andenvironment inferencing. The data resolution required to accuratelyidentify, extract, and reconstruct important features, which vary widelydepending upon the application, emphasizes the need of an automatedapproach not relying on a humanintheloop. In recent yearsalgorithmic strategies fusing aerial lidar with hyperspectral andorthorectified imagery have been proposed, taking advantage ofinferencing capabilities of each sensor type and increased overallconfidence in the data segmentation step. No technique exists today,however, that fully automates the endtoend process  from the initialcollection of the uncorrected data to the production of a finished,accurate and realistic urban scene. Notwithstanding, key milestonesthat minimize human intervention have been made, and notable highquality suites of semiautomated tools are available. In this paper, anendtoend approach towards full automation of urban scenegeneration is presented. The paper discusses the advantages ofdecisionlevel fusion at each segmentation step after an initialhypothesis of the features classification has been made. The merit ofsuch a strategy from the point of view of implementing it within a fullyautomated system supporting military planning and situationalawareness is presented.656418, Session 5Experimental determination of key visibility modelingparameters for aircraftS. R. Murrill, Army Research Lab. B. S. Miller, T. Maurer, U.S. ArmyNight Vision  Electronic Sensors Directorate W. K. Krebs, Office ofNaval Research G. Hewitt, U.S. Dept. of Transportation R. G.Driggers, U.S. Army Night Vision  Electronic Sensors DirectorateThe Federal Aviation Administration FAA is presently engaged inresearch to quantify the visibility of aircraft under two importantscenarios aircraft observed directly by human operators in air trafficcontrol towers ATCTs, and aircraft observed by human operatorsthrough unmanned aerial vehicle UAV sensors cameras viewedthrough groundbased display systems.  In FY04 and FY05 an ATCTvisibility analysis software tool FAA Vis was first developed and thenenhanced by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory ARL in collaborationwith the U.S. Armys Night Vision and Electronic Sensors DirectorateNVESD, and the FAA.  In FY05, a baseline version of a UAV SeeAndAvoid visibility analysis software tool was developed by the ARL, againin collaboration with NVESD and the FAA.  As a first step towardvalidation of these models, experimental determination of key visibilitycalibration parameters such as the fieldofview FOV searchtimeequations, the target aircraft discrimination difficulty criteria N50 fordetection, recognition, and identification, and the proper characteristicdimensions for highaspectratio targets aircraft, is required.  Thispaper will report on the results of a human perception HP experimentdesigned to measure both human response time and detectionaccuracy to displayed images containing variablysized, scalemodel,target aircraft images synthetically placed into real sky or terrainbackgrounds at random locations within the FOV as a function ofbackground clutter level.  Determination of these critical parameters willserve to calibrate the UAV SeeAndAvoid visibility analysis tool.  Asecond HP experiment designed to calibrate the FAA Vis ATCT visibilityanalysis tool will be reported on at a later date.  Both visibility analysistools are currently available for preliminary use online www.hf.faa.govvisibility.656419, Session 5Automating groundfixed target modeling with the smarttarget model generatorD. A. Verner, Applied Research Associates, Inc. R. C. Dukes, AirForce Research Lab.The Air Force Research Lab, Munitions Directorate, Lethality andVulnerability Branch AFRLMNAL is tasked with providing expeditiousweapons effectiveness analyses of several weapons concepts againstvarious types of buildings that may be potential target types. Thebuilding model must be generated before weapon effectivenessanalysis can be performed against groundfixed target sets.  Existingtargetmodeling tools do not provide rapid target model generationnecessary for the required quick turnaround lethality and vulnerabilityweapon effectiveness simulations.In response to this need, AFRLMNAL, under a small businessinnovative research phase II contract developed a 3D modeling toolthat will allow users to rapidly generate building models for weaponassessment analysis.  This tool is called the Smart Target ModelGenerator STMG.  The STMG is a graphical tool that will allow users toquickly and automatically generate buildings that can be analyzed byvarious types of weapon effectiveness analysis tools.  The STMG willprovide the structural engineering data in addition to the geometry ofthe target that is required by various weapon effectiveness codes.  Thispaper will present information on STMG and how it will assist the userto rapidly generate target models for lethality and vulnerabilityassessments.656420, Session 6Developing Markov chain models for road surfacesimulationW. B. Israel, J. B. Ferris, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.Chassis loads and vehicle handling are primarily functions of thecharacteristics of the road surface over which a vehicle is traversing.By accurately measuring the geometries of road surfaces, one cangenerate computer models that will better predict the loads introducedto various vehicle components as well as have a more realistic model bywhich to determine vehicle response to the surface over which it istraveling.  However, the logistics and computational power necessary tohandle such large data files makes this problem a difficult one toresolve, especially when vehicle design deadlines are impending.  Weaim to improve this process by developing Markov Chain models bywhich all relevant characteristics of road surface geometries will bepresent in the model.  This will reduce the logistical difficulties that arepresented when attempting to collect data and run a simulation usingphysical data that was intentionally collected for a specific simulation.We will generate our models primarily by measuring road profiles ofhighways in the United States.  Any synthetic road realized from aparticular model is representative of all profiles in the set from which themodel was derived.  Realizations of any length can then be generatedallowing efficient simulation and timely information about chassis loadsthat can be used to make better informed design decisions, morequickly.656421, Session 6Development of a 3D terrain measurement systemJ. V. Kern, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.The ability to measure road profiles accurately has progressed over thelast four decades from response type systems to vehicle independentsystems.  General Motors Research developed direct measurement ofroad profiles in the 1960s using a roadfollowing wheel extendingConf. 6564 Modeling and Simulation for Military Operations II spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 243below the body of a host vehicle to measure the relative distancebetween the body and the road surface and an accelerometer tocalculate the absolute body motion. The Australian Road ResearchBoard ARRB substituted a laser for the roadfollowing wheel in 1987.Although a great deal of work has been done to refine these systems inthe past 20 years, the work developed in this paper is the first to breakfrom these established techniques.  The system developed in this workestablishes a new level of fidelity, resolution, and applications in terrainmeasurement.  First, the system is developed for both highwayapplications and offroad terrain.  Current road profiling systems areonly suited for highway applications.  Second, the system is capable ofmeasuring terrain in three dimensions, on a grid of approximately 5mmin the horizontal plane, over a width of 4 meters.  Third, the longitudinaldistance traveled is now calculated with 2 cm accuracy, even over longtrials of 10 km or more.  It is only by increasing the fidelity andresolution of terrain topology data that application of these data can beadvanced.  This system is an enabling technology to pursue moreadvanced terrain modeling analyses and applications such as and 3Dtire models and terramechanics.  Ultimately, the knowledge of how thedata are acquired can lead to insights into advanced applications of thedata.656422, Session 6Characterizing 2D road profiles using ARIMA modelingtechniquesJ. V. Kern, J. B. Ferris, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.Load data representing severe customer usage is needed throughout achassis development program the majority of these chassis loadsoriginate with the excitation from the road.  These chassis loads areincreasingly derived from vehicle simulations, however simulating avehicle traversing long roads is impractical and a method to produceshort roads with given characteristics must be developed.  There aremany methods currently available to characterize roads when they areassumed to be homogeneous.  This work develops a method ofcharacterizing nonstationary road profile data using ARIMAAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average modeling techniques.  Thefirst step is to consider the road to be a realization of an underlyingstochastic process.  Next, nonstationary measured road profile data istransformed by differencing to create a stationary process.  The order ofthe autoregressive model is then determined utilizing the sampleautocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions.  The adequacy ofthe model is evaluated through statistical diagnostic checks performedon synthetic data generated by the autoregressive model parameters.Finally, the generated data is integrated to return a synthetic roadprofile.  The use of the ARIMA model parameters in classifying roadprofiles is also discussed.  By classifying various road profilesaccording to given model parameters, a tool is created in which a usercan easily select a type of road to simulate.  Any synthetic road realizedfrom a given class of model parameters will represent all roads in thatset, resulting in a timely and efficient simulation of a vehicle traversingany given type of road.656423, Session 6Analysis and estimation of vehicle position measurementin a 3D terrain scanning systemS. M. Wagner, J. B. Ferris, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and StateUniv.During the development of an automotive chassis, load datarepresenting severe customer usage is needed to test the vehicle.  Themajority of these loads originate form the excitations of the vehicle fromthe road. Therefore, for modeling purposes, a well defined terrain profileis needed.  Currently, terrain profiling technology includes the use ofvehicle mounted lasers to acquire the topological data.  In suchsystems, the profile data is measured relative to the lasers movingreference frame as the vehicle traverses the terrain.  This necessitatesthe removal of the vehicles body motion from the laser acquired data.This work examines one such 3D terrain measurement system in whichseveral sensors are used to approximate the vehicles motion.Differential GPS and an inertial measurement unit IMU located at thevehicles center of mass are typically combined using a Kalman filter.This technique is examined when additional accelerometers are placedat the location of the laser.  This data is then used to cancel out thebody motion of the vehicle using common mode rejection.   This workexamines the methodology of combining the GPS, IMU, andaccelerometer solutions into a best estimate of the vehicles true pitchand roll.656424, Session 7The development of an assessment tool for predictingthe mobility of lightweight autonomous vehicles oncoastal terrainM. E. Worley, R. Ping, C. Sandu, D. W. Hong, Virginia PolytechnicInstitute and State Univ.The assessment of lightweight vehicles is hampered by the lack ofanalysis tools. Comparing the mobility of robotic vehicles with variousmeans of locomotion is even more challenging due to specific vehicleterrain interaction and mission goals. This study focuses on thedevelopment of an assessment tool for the performance prediction oflightweight autonomous vehicles with different locomotion platforms oncoastal terrain. It consists of 1 the development of a comparisonmatrix and indexing function, 2 modeling and development of novelforms of locomotion, 3 physical experimentation of lightweight trackedand wheeled vehicles on sand.A statistical analysis based on the House of Quality is performed toidentify the relationships between mission profile requirements, generalperformance measures, and vehicle configuration. This information,combined with known values for vehicle metrics, is used to obtain anindex formula to quantitatively compare the mobility of a userchosenset of vehicles, regardless of their methods of locomotion.For experimental analysis, several new autonomous vehicles with novelforms of locomotion are under development. Dynamic models andprototypes provide the information needed to compare them withtraditional wheeled and tracked vehicles.To evaluate the applicability of current terramechanics models on light,robotic vehicles, a series of experimental tests has been designed. Therunning support for these tests is sand with different gradations, atvarious levels of moisture.The statistical analysis, the design, and the experimental componentsof this study combine to provide useful insights in understanding andquantifying the mobility of lightweight vehicles operating on deformableterrain.656425, Session 7Using multibody simulation to evaluate armor impacts onmilitary vehicle automotive performanceD. D. Gunter, U.S. Army Research, Development and EngineeringCommandThe ongoing effort in South West Asia has driven the Army to add armorto tactical and material handling vehicles that did not have an armorrequirement when procured.  This paper describes a Modeling andSimulation MS effort undertaken at the US Army ResearchDevelopment and Engineering Commands Tank Automotive Research,Development and Engineering Center TARDEC to investigate theimpact adding armor has on these vehicles automotive performance.We describe efforts to quantify performance degradation and identifysafe operational limits, as well as experiments performed using thecomputer models to identify vehicle characteristics and suspensionparameters that have the greatest impact on vehicle performancechanges due to the addition of armor.  Also design parameter tradeoffsbetween lateral stability and ride quality influences, and efforts tobalance these tradeoffs to arrive at an optimum configuration aredescribed.Conf. 6564 Modeling and Simulation for Military Operations II244 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656426, Session 7Acoustic response modeling of energetics systems inconfined spacesD. R. Gonzalez, M. J. Sanford, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. W. Liou,Western Michigan Univ. R. Hixon, Univ. of ToledoUrban warfare presents many challenges to the warfighter.  Amongthese is the fact that urban terrains add a degree of confinement inwhich the use of energetics systems like small, shouldermountedrocket launchers could pose as much hazard to the warfighter as theenemy.  Currently, it is of interest to design a shouldermountedenergetics system capable of being fired within the confines of a closedroom with windows.  The concern comes in the decibel levels thewarfighter is exposed to while launching within such a room.  Theselevels are well beyond those a human ear can withstand withoutcausing severe hearing damage.  Hence, the goal of the final design isto have a system that generates sound levels tolerable with minimalhearing protection.To aid in the design of such a system, a computational aeroacousticscodes turbulence modeling capabilities have been modified to allowsuch a system to be modeled.  In particular, the kepsilon modelimplemented in the code had to be modified with an additional densityterm in order to compensate for the largedensity gradients inherent inthe launchers exhaust jet. Additionally, an extensive database of actualrocket motor firings was used to develop realistic inflow profiles to thecode.  With these, the contributions to the perturbed pressure acousticfield from the gas exhaust and the projectile round were modeledseparately.  These results were then superimposed to obtain an overallpressuredisturbance field which was postprocessed with the use of aFastFourier Transform to obtain pressure spectra to compare to actualtest data.656427, Session 7Modeling of space shuttle SRB aft ends for inherentaerodynamic bias determinationD. R. Gonzalez, T. J. Gebhard, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. S. P.Stapf, U.S. Air ForceThe Range Safety System RSS onboard the Space TransportationSystem provides the ability to partially destruct the solid rocketboosters SRBs during launch mishaps.  This partial destruction bringsabout thrust termination, allowing the orbiter to separate from thethrusters and glide safely to an alternate landing field. The destructaction creates a large explosive debris footprint which may pose risksto the public and workers.  The majority of this risk comes from the aftends of the SRBs, which fall largely intact along with the remainingpropellant.  Historically, no data on such a scenario has been availableand in support of the Space Shuttle ReturntoFlight schedule,aerodynamic and trajectory analyses were performed to characterizeany pitch angle biases associated with the aft ends descent afterinitiating the linear shaped charges LSCs on the SRBs.  It is importantto note that this study makes no conclusions on the explosive yieldcharacteristics of these aft ends as they impact ground.  Further testswould be necessary to assess these characteristics.  The study wasconducted in three phases.  First, a densitycorrected, parametric solidmodel of the SRB aft ends was developed.  For simplicity, severalinternal fixtures, such as the thrust vectoring assemblies, were lumpedinto a single, densityaccurate part at the proper location to allow forthe mass properties to be as accurate as possible.  CFD wind tunnelruns were then performed at various angles of attack and Machnumbers to simulate the aft ends reaching apogee at differentconfigurations.  It was found that, at the subsonic speeds of interest,the aft ends were quite insensitive to Mach number.  Finally, the findingsfrom the initial phases were incorporated into a sixdegreeoffreedommodel.  The model utilized classical dynamic equations and actualSpace Shuttle trajectory data to simulate RSS initiation at differentMission Elapsed Times.  Results show the aft end has a bias towardsimpacting at 5, 70, or 175 degrees and takes an average of 10seconds to stabilize into any one of these orientations after beingseparated from the SRB forward body.656416, Session 8Survey of contemporary aircraft flight dynamics modelsfor use in airspace simulationS. M. McGovern, John A. Volpe National Transportation SystemsCtr.The U.S. DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center VolpeCenter has been tasked with the development of a Governmentowned, Monte Carlobased computer simulation capability to enablerigorous analysis and certification of procedures, equipment, andairspace.  Unique elements of this capability are the stochastic i.e.,random, but with known probability distributions models of almostevery component of the airpace  mechanical, electronic, and human including navigation aids, surveillance systems such as radar, pilots,aircraft, air traffic controllers, and weather combined with known,discrete artifacts such as runway size and configuration, and obstacles.Due to the complexity, size, schedule, and aviation safetycritical natureof the simulation development effort, the Volpe Center has proposed adetailed survey of the current stateoftheart in aircraft flight dynamicmodels for use in the simulation.  This flight dynamics survey includesdescriptions of basic 3D performance envelopes of various aircrafte.g., acceleration, deceleration, turn rate, climb rate, highfidelitymodels such as proprietary aircraft manufacturer models, commercialofftheshelf models e.g., Laminar Researchs XPlane andMicrosofts Flight Simulator, Government models i.e., NASA or FAA,and originally developed mathematical models i.e., six degrees offreedom or 6DOF  providing x, y, and z i.e., horizontal, vertical, andheight, and pitch, roll, and yaw roll data  models using standardaircraft dynamics through implementation of the classical aircraftequations of motion, quaternion transformation methods, direct cosineEuler transformations, and nondimensional aerodynamic coefficientimplementation.656428, Session 8Modeling of microstructure evolution during LENSTMdepositionL. Wang, H. ElKadiri, S. Felicelli, P. T. Wang, Mississippi State Univ.B. R. Gady, U.S. Army Tankautomotive and Armaments CommandLaser Engineered Net Shaping LENSTM is a technology proven to becapable of repairing and fabricating complex components made fromdifficulttoprocess materials without compromising the parent materialproperties.  The LENS process is a direct metal deposition technologyused to produce near netshape metal parts directly from computergenerated designs. The thermomechanical properties of the asdeposited metal, however, are highly sensitive to the processparameters and can be unacceptable due to an inadequateunderstanding of the material behavior. To fully achieve the original onestep fabrication attribute of the LENS process, the process parametersmust be optimized. Modeling and simulation methods have thepotential to effectively optimize the LENS process. In this paper, ametallurgical model for microstructural evolution in low alloy steel laserdeposits was developed by applying the coupled thermodynamics andkinetics approach, incorporated in the DICTRA program. The modelpredicts austenite grain size and volume fraction of the solid phases asa function of the material composition and heat input. For phasetransformation, the model captures nucleation and growth mechanismswith physical distinction between displacive and reconstructiveprocesses. A threedimensional finite element thermal model based onthe finite element software SYSWELD was developed to calculate thecomplex thermal history and as such map the microstructuraltransformations upon each overlaying deposition. The combined use ofthe thermal and metallurgical models provides useful information onhow to control the process parameters and produce LENS depositswith improved qualities.Conf. 6564 Modeling and Simulation for Military Operations II spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 245656429, Session 8Design and modeling of prognostics and selfmaintenance systems for military applications and futurecombat systemsJ.

J. Chan, C. Sandu, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. T.Streett, A. Ko, AVID LLCA multibody dynamics model of a Vertical Takeoff and Landing VTOLUnmanned Aerial Vehicle UAV is presented in this study. The scope ofthe project was to investigate a lightweight landing gear which has astable and robust landing performance. Two original designs of thelanding gear for the module of interest have been modeled and analyzedin this study. Two new designs have also been developed, modeled, andanalyzed. A limited analysis of the forces that occur in the legsstruts hasalso been performed, to account for possible failure of the members dueto buckling.The model incorporates a sloped surface of deformable terrain forstability analysis of the landing scenarios, and unilateral constraints tomodel the ground reaction forces upon contact. The lift forces on theUAV are modeled as mathematical relations dependent on the speed ofthe ducted fan to enable the variation of the impact velocities and thedifferent landing scenarios.The simulations conducted illustrate that initial conditions at landing havea big impact on the stability of the module. The two new designs accountfor the worst possible scenario, and, for the material properties given,end with a larger weight than the one of the original design with threelegs and a ring. Simulation data from several landing scenarios arepresented in this paper, with analysis of the difference in performanceamong the different designs.656431, Session 8Emissive signature for HMMWV run flat insert modelingand simulationW. W. Gardetto, Drive Dynamics LLC D. J. Gorsich, A. Kurec, J. R.Mabesa, Jr., D. Murray, U.S. Army TankAutomotive Research,Development and Engineering Ctr.Analyzing thermodynamic patterns during product development caneasily be characterized by various Modeling and Simulation softwareprograms to observe and identify an Emissive Signature. An infraredspectrum distinguishes pattern profiles unique to the product for boththermodynamic performance and accurate verification onselected materials. A collaborative CRADA effort has been establishedbetween the US Army RDECOMTARDEC and Drive Dynamics LLC ofDallas, TX on the development of an advanced Run Flat Insert System formilitary wheeled vehicles. Mapping of measured infrared thermometervalues help in locating and determining whether or not materialtemperatures are within design limits. Prior testing by the US ArmyPhysical Simulation Team have established a baseline EmissiveSignature for HMMWV wheel assemblies at specific loads and speeds.As advanced Run Flat Insert Systems are developed for increased loadcapacities using structurally engineered profiles the Emissive Signaturecan be used to compare and aid in establishing performance andproduct longevity.656432, Session 9Modeling and simulation for small system integration ofmilitary and homeland security applicationsM.

E. Collins, P. E. Vegdahl, Toyon Research Corp.This paper describes our recent work combining a highfidelitybattlefield simulator, a suite of autonomous sensor and navigationcontrol algorithms for unmanned air vehicles UAVs, and a hardwareintheloop control interface. The complete system supports multiple realand simulated UAVs that search for and track multiple real andsimulated targets.Targets communicate their realtime locations to the simulator through awireless GPS link. Data for real targets is used to create targets in thesimulation testbed that may exist alongside additional simulatedtargets. The navigation and video sensors onboard the UAVs are taskedvia another wireless link by our control algorithm suite to search forand track targets that exist in the simulation. Video data is streamed toan image plane video tracker IPVT, which produces detections thatcan be fed to a global tracker within the control suite. Routing andgimbal control algorithms use information from the global tracker totask the UAVs, thus completing an information feedback control loop.Additional sensors such as the ground moving target indicator GMTIradar can exist within the simulation and generate simulated detectionsto augment the tracking information obtained from the IPVT.Our simulator is part of Toyons Simulation of the Locations and Attackof Mobile Enemy Missiles SLAMEM tool.

The testbed is HLA high level architecturecompliant, allows for a distributed simulation with dynamicallyconfigurable federates, and can also be used for testing actualequipment in a simulated scenario. One of the key components in thetestbed is a set of planning tools that can be used to show ranges forsensors, jamming and communication systems. These tools can beused not only for planning the mission e.g. best route but can also beused during the mission to show the location of possible threats or therange of own equipment sensor, jamming, communication in differentsituations. During a mission these tools can be used to support thedecisions of what actions to take in different situations. One goal withdeveloping the planning tools in the testbed is to learn how to useplanning tools in real life scenarios.

Zhao, E. Santos, Jr., Dartmouth College F. Pratto, A. R. Pearson,Univ. of Connecticut B. R. McQueary, A. Breeden, L. S. Krause,SecurborationNowadays, there is an increasing demand for the military to conductoperations that are beyond traditional warfare. In these operations,analyzing and understanding who are involved in the situation, how theyare going to behave, and why they behave in certain ways is critical forsuccess. The challenge lies in that behavior does not simply followuniversalfixed doctrines it is significantly influenced by soft factors i.e.cultural factors, societal norms, etc.. In addition, there is rarely just oneisolated enemy the behaviors and responses of all groups in the region,and the dynamics of the interaction among them composes animportant part of the whole picture. The Dynamic Adversarial GamingAlgorithm DAGA project aims to provide a wargaming environment forautomation of simulating dynamics of geopolitical crisis and eventuallybe applied to military simulation and training domain, andorcommercial gaming arena. The focus of DAGA is on modelingcommunities of interest COIs, where various individuals, groups, andorganizations as well as their interactions are captured. The frameworkshould provide a context for COIs to interact with each other andinfluence others behaviors. These behaviors must incorporate softfactors by modeling cultural knowledge. We do so by representingcultural variables and their influence on behavior using probabilisticnetworks.  In this paper, we describe our COI modeling, thedevelopment of cultural networks, the interaction architecture, and aprototype of DAGA. This effort is supported in part through the AirForce Office of Scientific Research projects on DAGA and culturalmodeling of adversarial behavior.Conf. 6564 Modeling and Simulation for Military Operations II spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 247Conf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIIIMondayThursday 912 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral,Hyperspectral, and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII656501, Session 1Hyperspectral anomaly detection beyond RXA. P. Schaum, Naval Research Lab.The basic multivariate anomaly detector the RX algorithm of Kellyand Reed remains little altered after nearly 30 years and performsreasonably well with hyperspectral imagery. Better performance can beachieved in spectral applications by recognizing a deficiency in the RXgenerating hypothesis test. The problem is commonly ameliorated bydeleting several highvariance clutter dimensions. However, there is abetter way than removing the offending subspace. Differences betweentarget and background signals in the clutter dimensions can beexploited to enhance discrimination. Two methods are discussed forachieving detection gain using this principle. One evolves the RXalgorithm to incorporate clutterdependent weights, including antiRXterms in the clutter subspace. The exact form of the detector can bederived from a simple modification of the common anomaly hypothesistest. The second involves the nonlinear suppression of false alarmscaused by identifiable clutter detections. Both techniques rely ultimatelyon the incorporation of simple spectral phenomenology into thedetection process.656502, Session 1Beyond the adaptive matched filter nonlinear detectorsfor weak signals in highdimensional clutterJ. Theiler, B. Foy, A. M. Fraser, Los Alamos National Lab.For known signals that are linearly superimposed on gaussianbackgrounds, the linear adaptive matched filter AMF is wellknown tobe the optimal detector.  The AMF has furthermore proved to beremarkably effective in a broad range of circumstances where it is notoptimal, and for which the optimal detector is not linear.  In these cases,nonlinear detectors are theoretically superior, but direct estimation ofnonlinear detectors in highdimensional spaces often leads to flagrantoverfitting and poor outofsample performance. Despite this difficultyin the general case, we will describe several situations in whichnonlinearity can be effectively incorporated into a weak signal detector.A unifying theme among these nonlinear detectors is that they can bedescribed using the AMF as a first component.  This allowsimprovement over AMF performance while avoiding the full force ofdimensionalitys curse.656503, Session 1A comparative study of linear and nonlinear anomalydetectors for hyperspectral imageryN. M. Nasrabadi, Army Research Lab. H. Goldberg, Univ. ofMarylandCollege ParkIn this paper several linear and nonlinear anomaly detectors areimplemented and their results are compared. At each pixel location weuse a dual window to separate the local area into two regions  theinnerwindow region IWR and the outerwindow region OWR. Thesize of the dual window is set such that the inner window encloses atargetsized region and the outer window includes its neighboringbackground. We then exploit the differences of the statistical featuresbetween the IWR and OWR to check whether the inner materials pixelsare substantially different than the neighboring materials. Based on themeans and covariance matrixes of the IWR and OWR, a projectionvector is generated in the original input domain as well as in a highdimensional feature space through the use of kernelbased learningalgorithms. The spectral mean vectors in the IWR and OWR are thenprojected onto the linear projection operator as well as its nonlinearversion so called kernelbased projection operator. The direction of theprojection vector is determined such that the projected values of theIWR and OWR mean vectors are well separated. Anomalies aredetected if the separation of the projected values is greater than apredefined threshold.We have used four different methods to calculate the projection vector.i Eigen separation transform EST and Kernel ESTA difference covariance matrix DCOV is calculated within the dualwindow by subtracting the covariance matrix of the OWR vectors fromthat of the IWR vectors. The eigenvector of DCOV associated with thelargest positive eigenvalue is used as the projection vector.ii Principal component analysis PCA and Kernel PCA The firsteigenvector of either the IWR or the OWR vectors is used as theprojection vector.iii Fisher linear discriminant FLD and Kernel FLD The projectionvector is the Fisher basis vector that maximizes the betweenclassscatter and minimizes the withinclass scatter simultaneously.iv ReedXiaoli algorithm RX and Kernel RX The meandifferencevector between the IWR and OWR is normalized by the covariancematrix of the background pixel vectors OWR vectors and then used asthe projection vector.The anomaly detectors based on the above methods have been appliedto the HYDICE HYperspectral Digital Imagery Collection Experimentand mine images and detection performance for each method has beengenerated. Performance comparison ROC curves of the four methodswill also be included in the full paper.656504, Session 1Adaptive constrained signal detectors for hyperspectralimagesS. E. Johnson, Lockheed Martin Coherent Technologies M. T.Eismann, Air Force Research Lab. S. C. Cain, Air Force Institute ofTechnologyAn algorithm called the constrained signal detector CSD was recentlyintroduced for the purpose of target detection in hyperspectral images.The CSD assumes that hyperspectral pixels can be modeled as linearmixtures of material signatures and stochastic noise. It has been shownto be superior in theory than the orthogonal subspace projection OSPtechnique.The CSD requires knowledge of the spectra of the backgroundmaterials in the hyperspectral image. But in practice the backgroundmaterial spectra are often unknown and the CSD can not beimplemented. In this paper, estimation techniques are used to create anadaptive version of the CSD. This adaptive algorithm uses training datato develop a description of the image background and adaptivelyimplement the CSD. The adaptive CSD only requires knowledge of thetarget spectrum. It is shown through simulations that the adaptive CSDperforms nearly as well as the CSD operating with complete knowledgeof the background material spectra.656505, Session 1Anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery acomparison of methods using diurnal and seasonal dataP. C. Hytla, R. C. Hardie, Univ. of Dayton M. T. Eismann, J. Meola,Air Force Research Lab.The use of hyperspectral imaging HSI technology to support a varietyof civilian, commercial, and military remote sensing applications, isgrowing.  The rich spectral information present in HSI allows for moreaccurate ground cover identification and classification than withpanchromatic or multispectral imagery.  One class of problems wherehyperspectral images can be exploited, even when no a priori248 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssinformation about a particular ground cover material is available, isanomaly detection.  Here spectral outliers anomalies are detectedbased on how well each hyperpixel spectral irradiance vector for agiven pixel position fits within some background statistical model.Spectral anomalies may correspond to areas of interest in a givenscene.  In this work, we compare several anomaly detectors found inthe literature in novel experiments.  In particular, we study theperformance of the anomaly detectors in detecting several manmadepainted panels in a natural background using visiblenearinfraredhyperspectral imagery.  The data have been collected over the courseof a year, allowing us to test the robustness of the anomaly detectorswith seasonal change.  We also compare the performance of thesedetectors at various times of day, to study diurnal effects.  Thedetectors considered include the simple Gaussian anomaly detector, aGaussian mixture model GMM anomaly detector, and the clusterbased anomaly detector CBAD.  We examine the effect of the numberof components for the GMM and the number of clusters for the CBAD.Our preliminary results suggest that the use of a GMM yields the bestresults for our data.656506, Session 1A theoretical framework for hyperspectral anomalydetection using spectral and spatial a priori informationB. Yver, R. Marion, Commissariat a lEnergie Atomique FranceThis study presents a new theoretical approach for anomaly detectionusing a priori information about the target. This a priori knowledge dealswith the general spectral behavior and the spatial distribution of thetarget. This method is totally different to matched filters which suffer ofa relative sensitivity to low errors in the target spectral signature. Weincorporate the spectral a priori knowledge in a new detection distanceand we propose a Bayesian approach with a markovian regularization tosuppress potential targets that do not respect the spatial a priori. Gainsof performances are illustrated on simulated data consisting in realisticanomalies superimposed on a real HyMap hyperspectral image.656508, Session 2The impact of initialization procedures on unsupervisedunmixing of hyperspectral imagery using the constrainedpositive matrix factorizationY. Masalmah, M. VlezReyes, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezThe authors proposed in previous papers the use of the constrainedPositive Matrix Factorization cPMF to perform unsupervised unmixingof hyperspectral imagery. Two iterative algorithms were proposed tocompute the cPMF based on the GaussSeidel and penalty approachesto solve optimization problems. Results presented in previous papershave shown the potential of the proposed method to performunsupervised unmixing in HYPERION and AVIRIS imagery. Theperformance of iterative methods is highly dependent on theinitialization scheme. Good initialization schemes can improveconvergence speed, whether or not a global minimum is found, andwhether or not spectra with physical relevance are retrieved asendmembers. In this paper, different initializations using randomselection, longest norm pixels, and standard endmembers selectionroutines are studied and compared using simulated and real data.656510, Session 2Hyperspectral target detection by using independentcomponent analysisbased linear mixture modelE. Sarigul, M. S. Alam, Univ. of South AlabamaThis paper presents Independent Component Analysis ICA basedlinear mixture unmixing for the purpose of a target detectionapplication. ICA method has been relatively new method that attemptsseparate statistically independent sources from mixed dataset. Thedeveloped algorithm contains two steps  ICA based linear unmixing todiscriminate statistically independent sources. This step determinesboth endmembers in a given dataset as well as their correspondingabundance images. The second step performs analyzing unmixingresults for target detection application to detect the abundance imagethat corresponds to target class.  The performance of the developedalgorithm has been evaluated with several hyperspectral imagedatasets and presented here. The preliminary results show that thismethod is promising new method for target detection.656511, Session 3A hyperspectral image projector for hyperspectralimagersJ. P. Rice, E. A. Dakin, S. W. Brown, R. R. Bousquet, J. E. Neira, M.Litorja, National Institute of Standards and TechnologyWe have developed and demonstrated a Hyperspectral Image ProjectorHIP intended for systemlevel validation testing of hyperspectralimagers, including the instrument and any associated spectral unmixingalgorithms.  HIP, based on the same digital micromirror arrays used incommercial digital light processing DLP displays, is capable ofprojecting any combination of many different arbitrarily programmablebasis spectra into each image pixel at up to video frame rates.  We usea scheme whereby one micromirror array is used to produce lighthaving the spectra of endmembers i.e. grass, water, minerals, etc, anda second micromirror array, optically in series with the first, projects anycombination of these arbitrarily programmable spectra into the pixels ofa 1024 x 768 element spatial image, thereby producing temporallyintegrated images having spectrally mixed pixels.  HIP goes beyondconventional DLP projectors in that each spatial pixel can have anarbitrary spectrum, not just arbitrary color.  As such, the resultingspectral and spatial content of the projected image can simulaterealistic scenes that a hyperspectral imager will measure during its use.Also, the spectral radiance of the projected scenes can be measuredwith a calibrated spectroradiometer, such that the spectral radianceprojected into each pixel of the hyperspectral imager can be accuratelyknown. Use of such projected scenes in a controlled laboratory settingwould alleviate expensive field testing of instruments, allow betterseparation of environmental effects from instrument effects, and enablesystemlevel performance testing and validation of hyperspectralimagers as used with analysis algorithms.  For example, knownmixtures of relevant endmember spectra could be projected intoarbitrary spatial pixels in a hyperspectral imager, enabling tests of howwell a full system, consisting of the instrument  calibration  analysisalgorithm, performs in unmixing i.e. deconvolving the spectra in allpixels.  We discuss here the performance of the HIP as applied to alaboratory hyperspectral imager working in the visible spectral range.The technology is readily extendable to the ultraviolet and infraredspectral ranges, and the scenes can be static or dynamic.656512, Session 3Sonification of hyperspectral image dataM. Bernhardt, C. E. West, Waterfall Solutions Ltd. United KingdomThere are many reconnaissance tasks which involve an image analystviewing data from hyperspectral imaging systems and attempting tointerpret it. Hyperspectral image data is intrinsically hard to understand,even when armed with mathematical knowledge and a range of currentprocessing algorithms. This work is motivated by the search for newways to convey information about the spectral content of imagery topeople. In this work we have developed a tool for transforming differentaspects of spectral imagery into sounds that an analyst can hear. Trialshave been conducted that show that the use of these sonic mappingscan assist a user in tasks such as rejecting false alarms generated byautomatic detection algorithms. This paper describes some of thetechniques used and reports on the results of user trials.656513, Session 3New developments and application of the UPRMMATLAB hyperspectral image analysis toolboxS. RosarioTorres, M. VlezReyes, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezThe Hyperspectral Image Analysis Toolbox HIAT is a collection ofalgorithms that extend the capability of the MATLAB numericalConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 249computing environment for processing hyperspectral and multispectralimagery.

Thispaper will give an update on the capabilities of the toolbox and itsdistribution capability. We will also present results of the application ofthe toolbox to hyperspectral information extraction in many domains.656514, Session 3A hyperspectral model for target detectionM. Bernhardt, Waterfall Solutions Ltd. United Kingdom P. E. Clare,Defence Science and Technology Lab. Farnborough UnitedKingdom C. E. West, M. I. Smith, Waterfall Solutions Ltd. UnitedKingdomIn this paper an endtoend hyperspectral imaging system model isdescribed. This model is able to predict the performance ofhyperspectral imaging sensors in the visible through to the shortwaveinfrared regime for subpixel targets. The model represents all aspectsof the system including the target signature and background, theatmosphere, the optical and electronic properties of the imagingspectrometer as well as details of the processing algorithms employed.It is efficient, allowing MonteCarlo runs for sensitivity analysis or tosweep model parameters over a wide range. It is also capable ofrepresenting certain types of nonGaussian hyperspectral clutter arisingfrom heterogeneous backgrounds. The capabilities of the model aredemonstrated in this paper by considering the effect that different levelsof heavytailed nonGaussian clutter have on both anomaly detectionand spectral matchedfilter algorithms in terms of Receiver OperatingCharacteristic curves. Finally, some results from a preliminary validationexercise are presented.656515, Session 3Hyperspectral data processing algorithm comparisonsoftware HyperPACSD. Runnels, C. Leflore, Radiance Technologies, Inc. J. J. Dirbas,PAR Government Systems Corp.Radiance Technologies has developed and integrated a multispectral hyperspectral data analysis toolbox into an easy to use operatorinterface.

Radiance has used HyperPACS inthe evaluation of hyperspectral and multispectral algorithms in supportof an ongoing program. A description of HyperPACS, the GUI, andprocessing examples are given.656516, Session 3Visualization of hyperspectral imageryM. A. Hogervorst, P. Bijl, A. Toet, TNO Human Factors NetherlandsWe developed and evaluated methods for visualizing hyper spectraldata. The presentation techniques are of 3 types i movie typedisplaying subsequent bands as a movie, ii colour image merging thedata into three broadband channels and displaying these as a colourimage and iii matching strength displaying the similarity between thepixel signatures and a known target signature. The movie type i hasthe advantages that no assumptions about target signature are usedand no information is lost. The colour scheme ii has the advantage thatit can be displayed in a single image, so it can be used in realtime.Disadvantage is that some information is lost. A display of the match iiibetween pixels and a target can be interpreted easily and fast, but relieson precise knowledge of the target signature. Each scheme has itsadvantages and disadvantages and is more or less suited for realtimeand posthoc processing. The idea is that the final interpretation is bestleft to a human observer. In contrast to automatic target recognitionsystems the number of assumptions signature of target andbackground, target shape etc. can be small and the interpretation bythe human visual system is robust to noise and image transformations,and takes target and background into account. When more knowledgeabout target and background signature, shape etc. is available thismay be used to help the observer interpreting the data.656517, Session 4Spectralspatial filter selection for illuminationinvarianthyperspectral texture discriminationN. Nejati, G. E. Healey, Univ. of CaliforniaIrvineWe propose a method for selecting an optimal spatial filter based onboth spectral and spatial information to improve the discriminability ofhyperspectral textures. The feature vector for each class contains thecovariance matrix elements in filtered versions of the texture. The newmethod reduces the length of the representation by selecting an optimalsubset of bands and also uses an optimized spatial filter to maximizethe distance between feature vectors for the different texture classes.Band selection is performed based on the stepwise reduction of bands.We applied this method to a database of textures acquired underdifferent illumination conditions and analyzed the classification results.656518, Session 4Applicability of ICA to hyperspectral imagery of variouscomplexity levelsD. C. Koestler, P. J. Diute, D. W. Messinger, Rochester Institute ofTechnologySeveral methods to characterize highlydimensional reflectivehyperspectral imagery have been developed and used for variousapplications. Endmember selection schemes seek to define thecorners of the assumed convex hull in which the data lie. PrincipleComponents Analysis derives a rotation from the scene statistics torepresent the data in a space in which the data are uncorrelated.Recently, Independent Components Analysis has been applied tohyperspectral imagery for several applications. We assume that theoriginal source signals are independent but the data are linearcombinations of these source signals. We investigate the viability of thisapproach to retrieve the original source signals. In this work, syntheticdata of increasing levels of complexity are used to understand theapplicability of ICA to hyperspectral imagery. Initial datasets use oneand two classes of materials with inclass variability based onmeasured data. Further analysis is applied to multiple class datasets aswell as data with varying levels of subpixel mixing. Results using one,two and multiple class datasets will be described.656519, Session 4From PCA and MNF to ICA ERDAS IMAGINEincorporates nextgeneration remote sensing technologyfor improved spectral unmixing and target detectionC. A. Shah, Univ. of CaliforniaLos Angeles I. Anderson, Z. Gou, S.Hao, A. Leason, Leica Geosystems, LLCAnalysis of multihyperspectral imagery necessitates a selection of anoptimal subset of bands in order to avoid the Hughes phenomena andparameter estimation problems due to interband correlation. This canbe achieved by employing feature extraction techniques for significantreduction of data dimensionality. From the perspective of statisticalpattern recognition, feature extraction refers to a process, whereby adata space is transformed into a feature space, in which the originalConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII250 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssdata is represented by a reduced number of effective features, retainingmost of the intrinsic information content. Feature extraction from remotesensing imagery must also aim to enhance the discriminability ofsurface materials based on their spectral characteristics.Conventional remote sensing feature extraction techniques such asPrincipal Component Analysis PCA and Minimum Noise FractionMNF model the multihyperspectral image data with a multivariateGaussian distribution. Inadequacy of such algorithms stems from theGaussian distribution assumption, which is only an assumption ratherthan a demonstrable property of most remote sensing data. In order toovercome this fundamental limitation, we at Leica Geosystems havedeveloped a feature extraction technique based on IndependentComponent Analysis ICA that exploits the higher order statisticalcharacteristics of multihyperspectral imagery. ICA performs a lineartransformation of the image data, such that the resulting transformedfeatures are as statistically independent from each other as possible. Adirect implication of making the features statistically independent is thatthey contain complementary information and thus enhance thediscriminability of surface materials. Thus, compared to correlationbased transformations such as PCA and MNF, ICA not only decorrelatesthe features but also reduces the higher order statistical dependenciesbetween them.In this paper, we will provide a theoretical formulation of ICA and proveits superiority over PCA and MNF in a mathematical framework. Ourillustrations would also demonstrate the potential benefits of employingICA in improving the performance of several multihyperspectralanalysis techniques such as spectral unmixing, classification, andanomaly detection.656520, Session 4Integration of PCA and JPEG2000 for hypespectral imagecompressionQ. Du, W. Zhu, Mississippi State Univ.In this paper, we report our recent investigation on principalcomponents analysis PCA and JPEG2000 in hyperspectral imagecompression, where the PCA is for spectral coding and JPEG2000 is forspatial coding for principal component PC images referred to asPCAJPEG2000. We find out such an integrated scheme significantlyoutperforms the commonly used 3dimensional 3D JPEG2000 in ratedistortion performance, where the wavelet transform is used for spectralcoding. We also find out that the best rate distortion performanceoccurs when a subset of PCs is used instead of all the PCs. Anempirical approach to estimate the suboptimal number of PCs ispresented.In the AVIRIS and HYDICE experiments, PCAJPEG2000 can bringabout 510 dB increase in SNR compared to 3DJEPG2000, whoseSNR in turn is about 0.5dB greater than other popular wavelet basedcompression approaches, such as 3DSPIHT and 3DSPECK. Theperformance on detection and classification using the reconstructeddata is also evaluated. We find out that using PCA for spectraldecorrelation can provide better performance, in particular, in low bitrates. We will also present automatic algorithms to preremove noisybands and pixels to further enhance the performance ofPCAJPEG2000.656521, Session 5New grating designs for a CTIS imaging spectrometerN. A.

Sass, U.S. Army Tankautomotive and Armaments CommandWe present somenew grating designs for use in a computedtomographic imaging spectrometer CTIS and discuss their differenceswith previous gratings. One of the advantages of the new designs isthat they provide added flexibility for a tunable CTIS instrument, and weshow some preliminary data illustrating this advantage.656522, Session 5Reconfigurable liquidcrystal dispersing element forcomputed tomographic imaging spectrometerC. J. Vandervlugt, The Univ. of Arizona H. J. Masterson, BoulderNonlinear Systems, Inc. N. A. Hagen, E. L. Dereniak, The Univ. ofArizonaA Computed Tomographic Imaging Spectrometer CTIS is an imagingspectrometer which can acquire a multispectral data set in a singlesnapshot one focal plane array integration time with no moving parts.Currently, CTIS instruments use a specially designed computergenerated hologram CGH to disperse the light from a given spectralband into a grid of diffraction orders.  The capabilities of the CTISinstrument can be greatly improved by replacing the static CGHdispersing element with a reconfigurable liquid crystal spatial lightmodulator.  The liquid crystal spatial light modulators are tunedelectronically, enabling the CTIS to remain a nonscanning imagingspectrometer with no moving parts.  The ability to rapidly reconfigurethe dispersing element of the CTIS allows the spectral and spatialresolution to change by varying the number of diffraction orders,diffraction efficiency, etc.  In this work, we present the initial results ofusing a fully addressable, 2D liquid crystal spatial light modulator asthe dispersing element in a CTIS instrument.656523, Session 5Affordable spectropolarimetry with MANTIS3TJ.

Wang, Y. Wang, B. Hu, H. Q. Le, Univ. of HoustonLaserbased multispectral imaging allows measuring target intrinsicoptical scattering properties rather than just the scattered ambient lightintensity from targets like passive imaging. The resulting image is amapping of the target scattering optical response as a function ofwavelength and polarization that may contain features fordiscrimination, classification, and identification that are not distinctive inscattered light intensity images. This paper describes a study of laserbased multispectral and polarimetric imaging using multispectral nearand midIR laser. There are fundamental issues and challenges withlaserbased imaging that are different from passive imaging. This studyfocuses on the basic aspects of spectral and polarimetric scatteringphenomena, as well as the system engineering issues. The nearIRstudy employed several wavelengths from 0.6351.55 um, anddemonstrated the complex behavior of wavelength and polarizationdependence of diffuse scattering from various target surfaces. Themultispectral polarimetric Stokes vector images reveal unique anddistinctive features that are not evidenced in scattered intensity images.The midIR study employed 4 wavelengths from 3.39.6 um, and wasalso shown capable to resolve and distinguish small spectraldifferences that are not evidenced in the visible. System engineering isalso important for laserbased imaging. The system architecture hereemploys wavelengthdivisionmultiplexing for high spectral fidelity, andthe scalable CDMA approach for multiple transmitters and receivers fordistributed fieldofview. Although the experiments were done with lowpower lasers, the results are applicable to highpower ladar system, andsuggest that multispectral polarimetric laser imaging can be a uniqueand powerful technology for target discrimination.656526, Session 5Highperformance Sagnac interferometers using cooledand uncooled detectors for infrared hyperspectralapplicationsP.

A set of false color composites ofAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer AVHRR and MultichannelVisible and Infrared Scan Radiometer MVISR images was used toinvestigate the dispersion of the plumes, which may contain toxicsubstances, over wider areas, as well as to estimate plume spatialcharacteristics.656528, Session 6Hyperspectral image unmixing over Benthic habitatsM. VlezReyes, E. M. AlviraConcepcin, S. RosarioTorres, Univ.de Puerto Rico MayagezHyperspectral imagery HSI is an effective technology for quantitativemonitoring of shallow water coastal environments. Hyperspectralsensors collect hundreds of narrow and contiguously spaced spectralbands of data organized in the socalled hyperspectral cube. However,the spatial resolution of most HSI flown nowadays is larger than the sizeof the objects being observed. Therefore, the measured spectralsignature is a mixture of the signatures of the objects in the field of viewof the sensor. The high spectral resolution can be used to decomposethe measured spectra into its constituents. This is the socalledunmixing problem in HSI.  Spectral unmixing is the process by whichthe measured spectrum is decomposed into a collection of constituentspectra, or endmembers, and a set of corresponding fractions orabundances. Unmixing allows us to detect and classify subpixel objectsby their contribution to the measured spectral signal. Unmixing overbenthic habitats is further complicated by the presence of the watercolumn. Two approaches can be followed for unmixing over benthichabitats. In the first approach, the unmixing problem is treated in asimilar fashion as an unmixing problem over land where theatmospherically corrected image is unmixed using one of severalunmixing algorithms. In the second approach, the effects of the watercolumn are removed before or jointly with the abundance estimation. Inthis paper, we compare the performance of the two approaches inunmixing HYPERION and AVIRIS imagery over a reef area insouthwestern Puerto Rico.656529, Session 6Terrain categorization using LIDAR and multispectraldataA.

Data were collected on April12th, 2005 over a 10 km x 20 km region which is mixed use agricultureand wetlands.  LIDAR temporal information elevation values, intensityof returned light, and distribution of point returns in both vertical andspatial dimensions, were used to distinguish landcover types.  Terrainclassification was accomplished using LIDAR data alone, MultispectralQuickBird data alone, and a combination of the two data types.

MorenoRamrez, Escuela de Ingeniera de Antioquia ColombiaAccurate estimation of sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as soilmoisture from remotely sensed satellite images poses a great challenge.Yet, it is critical to face this challenge since the estimation of spatial andtemporal distributions of these parameters over large areas isimpossible using only ground measurements. A major difficulty for thecalibration and validation of operational remote sensing methods suchas SEBALNM, ALEXI, and DisALEXI  is the ground measurement ofsensible heat fluxes at a scale similar to the spatial resolution of theremote sensing image. While the spatial length scale of remote sensingimages covers a range from 30 m LandSat to 1000 m MODIS directmethods to measure sensible heat fluxes such as eddy covariance EConly provide point measurements at a scale that may be considerablysmaller than the estimate obtained from a remote sensing method. TheLarge Aperture scintillometer LAS flux footprint area is larger up to5000 m long and its spatial extent better constraint than that of ECsystems.

Devaraj, S. D. Brown, D. W. Messinger, A. A. Goodenough, D. R.Pogorzala, Rochester Institute of TechnologyAs the interest in polarization sensitive imaging systems increases, themodeling tools used to perform instrument trade studies and togenerate data for algorithm testing must be adapted to correctly predictpolarization signatures. The incorporation of polarization into the imagechain simulated by these tools must address the modeling of the naturalilluminants e.g. Sun, Moon, Sky, background sources e.g. adjacentobjects, the polarized Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution FunctionpBRDF of surfaces, atmospheric propagation extinction, scatteringand selfemission and sensor effects e.g. optics, filters. Although,each of these links in the image chain may utilize unique modelingapproaches, they must be integrated under a framework that addressesimportant aspects such as a unified coordinate space and a commonpolarization state convention.This paper will present a modeling framework for the prediction ofpolarized signatures within a natural scene. The proposed image chainwill utilize community developed modeling tools including anexperimental version of MODTRAN and BRDF models that have beeneither derived or extended for polarization e.g. BeardMaxwell, PriestGermer, etc.. This description will include the theory utilized in themodeling tools incorporated into the image chain model and thenumerical techniques utilized to integrate these links into a full signatureprediction capability. Analytical and experimental lab and field studieswill be presented that demonstrate the correct implementation andintegration of the described image chain framework within the DigitalImaging and Remote Sensing Image Generation DIRSIG model.656532, Session 7Recreation of a nominal polarimetric scene usingsynthetic modeling toolsD. R. Pogorzala, S. D. Brown, D. W. Messinger, C. Devaraj,Rochester Institute of TechnologyComparisons have been made showing that modeled multi andhyperspectral imagery can approach the complexity of real data and theuse of modeled data to perform algorithm testing and sensor modelingis well established. With growing interest in the acquisition andexploitation of polarimetric imagery, there is a need to perform similarcomparisons for this imaging modality.This paper will describe the efforts to reproduce polarimetric imageryacquired of a real world scene using a synthetic image generationenvironment. Real data was collected with the Wildfire Airborne SensorProgramLite WASPLite imaging system using three separatecameras to acquire simultaneously three polarization orientations.Modeled data was created using the Digital Imaging and RemoteSensing Image Generation DIRSIG model. This model utilizes existingtools such as polarized bidirectional reflectance distribution functionspBRDF, polarized atmospheric models, and polarizationsensitivesensor models to recreate polarized imagery. Results will showcomparisons between the real and synthetic imagery, highlightingsuccesses in the model as well as areas where improved fidelity isrequired.656533, Session 7Multiband texture synthesis using histogram and powerspectral density matchingS. Sarkar, G. E. Healey, Univ. of CaliforniaIrvineIn this work, we develop a new method for multispectral andhyperspectral texture synthesis using the multiband distribution andpower spectral densities.Different approaches to this problem suggested in the literature aremostly case specific and include histogram explosion, equalization inthe HSV or some other color space, equalization based on earth moverdistance EMD, etc.For multiband images, the usual practice is to define the psds for eachband separately. While this captures the inband autocorrelations, thecrossband correlations are not captured. Sometimes crosspsds aredefined if it is known that cross band correlations are important.However, as the number of bands increase, this method becomescomputationally prohibitive. We propose a method that expresses psdsfor multiband images using 3D fourier transforms. An iterative schemeis used to equalize the histogram and psds for an input and targetimage.Our experiments show that the iteration tends to converge after 510steps.The proposed method is computationally simple and yet yieldssatisfactory results.We compare synthesized multispectral textures with real multispectraldata.656534, Session 7Radiometric modeling of cavernous targets to assist inthe determination of absolute temperature for input toprocess modelsM. Montanaro, C. Salvaggio, D. W. Messinger, S. D. Brown,Rochester Institute of Technology A. J. Garrett, Savannah RiverNational Lab.Determination of the temperature of an internal surface withincavernous targets, such as the interior wall of a mechanical draftcooling tower, from remotely sensed imagery is important for manysurveillance applications.  The surface leaving radiance of an observedsurface is a combination of the selfemitted radiance and the reflectedbackground radiance. The selfemitted radiance component is afunction of the temperaturedependent blackbody radiation and theviewdependent directional emissivity. The reflected backgroundradiance component depends on the bidirectional reflectancedistribution function BRDF of the surface and the incident radiancefrom surrounding sources and the BRDF for each of these sources.Inside a cavity, the background radiance emanating from any of themultiple internal surfaces will be a combination of the selfemitted andreflected energy from the other internal surfaces as well as thedownwelling sky radiance.  This scenario provides for a complexradiometric inversion problem in order to arrive at the absolutetemperature of any of these internal surfaces.  The cavernous target hasoften been estimated as a blackbody, but in field experiments it hasbeen determined that this is not always true.  The Digital Imaging andRemote Sensing Image Generation DIRSIG modeling tool is beingused to represent a cavity target.  The model demonstrates thedependence of the radiance reaching the sensor on the emissivity of theinternal surfaces and the multiple internal interactions between all thesurfaces that make up the overall target.  The cavity model is extendedto a detailed model of a mechanical draft cooling tower.  Thepredictions of derived temperature from this model are compared tothose derived from actual infrared imagery collected with a helicopterbased broadband infrared imaging system collected over an operatingtower located at the Savannah River National Laboratory site.Conf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 253656535, Session 7Modeling signatures from particleladen rocket exhaustplumes and active transmission through battlefieldsmokeJ. L. Rapanotti, R. Farinaccio, P. Gosselin, R. Pimentel, A. Schfke,Defence RD CanadaValcartier CanadaParticleladen exhaust plumes radiate over the entire spectrum ofinterest from MMW to ultraviolet.  Detection and the ability to guide themissile is also affected by battlefield smoke.  The commercial fluiddynamics solver, FLUENT, is being developed to model these rocketplume phenomena.  Particles, produced by the motor, are representedby a discretized size distribution and are tracked as interaction with theplume occurs through energy and momentum transfer.  Thetemperature and position of the particles are then used to determine theradiance image and the contribution to the total spectral intensity.Battlefield smoke surrounding the missile can vary from dust to metalflake in composition and is distributed unevenly by turbulent mixingwith the atmosphere. This lack of homogeneity is modelled by solvingthe radiation transfer equations over ensembles of the composition.Once the plume flow field and the simulated battlefield environment areestablished, the performance of passive sensors and active sources,such as lasers and radar, is determined. The preliminary resultspresented in this study suggests that this approach can be useful inintegrating the various area of expertise required to develop hybridsensors for threat detection and missile guidance.656536, Session 8Fast multiscale smoothing and segmentation ofhyperspectral imageryJ. M. DuarteCarvajalino, Univ. de Puerto Rico Mayagez G. Sapiro,Univ. of Minnesota M. VelezReyes, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezAn algorithm for anisotropic smoothing and segmenting hyperspectralimagery is presented. Anisotropic smoothing reduces the spatial andspectral variability within uniform regions in the image, preserving thesharp discontinuities, which in turn improves the segmentation byincreasing the separability between the different regions in the image.The algorithm solves a discretized Partial Differential Equation PDEthat generates a discrete scalespace, represented by an irregularpyramid of coarser versions of the image. As the image is coarsened,spectralspatial statistics are gathered from the multiscalerepresentation of the image, increasing the separability of the differentregions in the image. At the same time, representative pixels areselected at each image scale, enabling a multiscale segmentation ofthe image. The segmentation is performed in a topdown process thatuses the representative pixels as seeds and distance metrics, based onthe accumulated statistics. The PDE is solved using Algebraic MultigridAMG, a numerical analysis technique useful for boundary valueproblems on highly unstructured grids, with greater accuracy and speedthan more traditional relaxation techniques. The coarsening step inAMG is based on a modified version of the Iterated WeightedAggregation method, tailored to better exploit the discrimination powerof high dimensional spaces such as those represented by hyperspectraldata.656537, Session 8Improving multispectral mapping by spectral modelingwith hyperspectral signaturesF. A. Kruse, Horizon GeoImaging, LLCHyperspectral imaging HSI data in the 0.4  2.5 micrometer spectralrange allow direct identification of materials using their fully resolvedspectral signatures, however, spatial coverage is limited. MultispectralImaging data MSI are spectrally undersampled and may not allowunique identification, but they do provide synoptic spatial coverage.Combining the two data types by modeling hyperspectral signatures tomultispectral band passes allows extending HSI mapping results toregional scales and leads to improved multispectral mapping over largerareas.Coincident hyperspectral Airborne VisibleInfrared AVIRISHyperionand multispectral ASTERMASTER data supported by field spectralmeasurements are used to allow modeling and extension ofhyperspectral signatures to multispectral data.  Fullscene mappingusing the modeled signatures allows subsequent mapping of extendedareas using the multispectral data.  Both the hyperspectral andmultispectral data are atmospherically corrected using commercialofftheshelf COTS atmospheric correction software.  Hyperspectral dataare then analyzed to determine spectral endmembers and their spatialdistributions, and validated using the field spectral measurements.Spectral modeling is used to convert the hyperspectral spectralsignatures to the multispectral data response.  Reflectance calibratedmultispectral data are then used to extend the hyperspectral mappingto the larger spatial coverage of the multispectral data.  Field verificationof mapping results is conducted and accuracy assessment performed.Additional sites are assessed with multispectral data using the modelingmethodology based on sceneexternal HSI andor field spectra butwithout scenespecific a priori hyperspectral analysis or knowledge.These results are further compared to field measurements andsubsequent hyperspectral analysis and mapping to validate the spectralmodeling approach.656538, Session 8Affine invariant and Trobust image registrationconflation algorithmB. Kovalerchuk, Central Washington Univ.The robust imagery conflation, coregistration and georeferencing arecritical in many applications such as analysis of multispectral data frommultiple sensors. This paper proposes a new affine invariant and noiserobust registrationconflation algorithm EAD algorithm based onalgebraic structures of linear and area based features. An algorithm thatmatches linear features from two images can be very accurate becauseit produces many matched points, but the selection of such robust andinvariant points is a longstanding challenge. There are knowndefinitions of points that are either robust or invariant, but not both. TheEqual Area Divider EAD point is a major new component of the EADbased registrationconflation algorithm. This point is affine invariant androbust to noise Trobust in a formal definition. It augments severalknown points such as MAL midpoint along the line and ES equalshoulder points that we have used in our structural algorithmspreviously. MAL and ES points mapped to the second image using ageneral affine transform differ from MAL and ES points in the secondimage in the same feature.  However, if MAL and ES points arecomputed after  affine transform of the first image to the second oneusing EAD points then MAL and ES points are the same or in the Trobust vicinity of MAL and ES points found in the matched feature inthe second image. This statement is formalized as a theorem and isused in EAD algorithm design. Advantages of the EAD registrationconflation algorithm are shown in the experiment.656540, Session 8Enhancing projection method of geometric correction ofsatellite image geometry with waveletbasedapproximationF. Arif, M. Akbar, National Univ. of Science and TechnologyPakistan A. Cuhadar, Carleton Univ. Canada A. Wu, NationalSpace Program Office of Taiwan TaiwanPrecise remote sensing and high resolution satellite images have madeit necessary to revise the geometric correction techniques used fororthorectification. There have been improvements in algorithms fromsimple 2D polynomial models to rigorous mathematical models derivedfrom digital photogrammetry. In such scenario, conventional methods ofphotogrametric modeling of remotely sensed images would beinsufficient for mapping purposes and might need to be substituted witha more rigorous approach to get a true orthophoto. To correctgeometric distortions in these, the process of geometric modelingbecomes important.Pixel projection method has been devised and used for geometriccorrection. Algorithm has been developed in C and used forConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII254 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssFORMOSAT2 high resolution satellite images. It georeferences asatellite image while geolocating vertices of the image with its geolocations extracted from ancillary data.  Accuracy and validity of thealgorithm has already been tested on different types of satellite images.It takes a level1A image and the output image is level2 image. Toincrease the geometric accuracy, a set of ground control points withmaximum accuracy can also be selected to determine the betterknowledge of position, attitude and pixel alignment.Previously, we had adopted different techniques of approximations andapplied three possible methods of interpolation for transformations ofimage pixels to earth coordinate system. Results showed that cubicconvolution based modeling gave best suitable output pixel values ascompared to bilinear interpolation and nearest neighbor methods.In this paper, we will apply certain other techniques of approximations.These will be mainly wavelet based.  Their results on different satelliteimages will be tested and they will be compared with previously appliedmethods.656584, Session 8Hyperspectral detection in high clutter using ellipticallycontoured distributionsA. P. Schaum, E. C. Allman, Naval Research Lab.A new class of hyperspectral detection algorithm based on ellipticallycontoured distributions ECDs is described.  ECDs have been studiedpreviously, but only for modeling the tails of background clutterdistributions. Here ECDs are exploited to produce new target detectionalgorithms. The methods generate highly selective decision surfacesand produce performance comparable to the best prior methods. Theprincipal advantage of the ECD model over older ones is the absence offree parameters needing optimization. A particularly simple version hasbeen evaluated, whose detection surfaces are from the same quadricfamily as those associated with subspace models. Experiments alsoindicate that ECDbased change detection in urban clutter can succeedfor targets with low spectral contrast, where standard signaturebasedmethods fail.656541, Session 9Comparative study of stateoftheart algorithms forhyperspectral image analysisC. Rivera, S. D. Hunt, Univ. de Puerto Rico MayagezThis work studies the endtoend performance of differenthyperspectral classification systems. Specifically, it compares the mostwidely used current state of the art algorithms with those developed atthe University of Puerto Rico. These include algorithms for imageenhancement, band subset selection, feature extraction, supervisedand unsupervised classification, and constrained and unconstrainedabundance estimation. The end to end performance for differentcombinations of algorithms is evaluated. The classification algorithmsare compared in terms of percent correct classification. This method,however, cannot be applied to abundance estimation, as the binary kindof evaluation used for supervised and unsupervised classification is notdirectly applicable for unmixing performance analysis. A procedure toevaluate unmixing performance is described in this paper and testedusing coregistrated data acquired by various sensors at different spatialresolutions. Statistics to analyze the unmixing performance are studiedfor a revealing representation of the results. Performance results aregenerally specific to the image used. In an effort to try and generalizethe results, a formal description of the complexity of the images usedfor the evaluations is required. Techniques for image complexityanalysis currently available for automatic target recognizers are includedand adapted to quantify the performance of the classifiers for differentimage classes.656542, Session 9Modeling subpixel orientation effects for hyperspectralimage analysisK. Chandra, Univ. of CaliforniaIrvineThe radiance spectrum corresponding to a single pixel in an airbornehyperspectral image is dependent on the reflectance and orientations ofthe surfaces within an area corresponding to the pixel. Additional factorsinclude the environmental conditions and the viewing geometry. In thispaper we adopt a physicsbased model which includes all of these factors.The model is a nonlinear parametric model and is based on subspacemodels for the reflectance spectra , illumination spectra and the pathscattered radiance. The subspace model for the illumination spectra andpathscattered radiance is coupled to account for the commondependence on the environmental condition and viewing geometry. Thenonlinear parametric model parameters are estimated using theLevenbergMarquardt method. We quantitatively analyze the utility of thismodel for the problems of subpixel orientation and reflectance recoveryand target detection using a set of simulated radiance spectra.656543, Session 9Gaussian smoothing of sparse spatial distributions asapplied to spectral separation calculations by use of theinformational differenceD. Sheffer, Y. Ultchin, Institute for Advanced Research andDevelopment IsraelThe characterization of separation between measured spectraldistributions of different objects, by the use of any divergenceevolvedmethod such as the Informational Difference, is problematic due to therelative sparsity of these distributions in the channel intensity space. Theexistence of zeroprobability regions in this space renders the calculationresult irrelevant, since the separation measure becomes either infinite orundefined.A method to surmount this problem using experimental data is proposed.We consider the statistical nature of measurements for all available visualdata, e.g. pixel values, and model the full spectral distributions of thesepixels as a congregate of normal distributions. The inherent infinite extentof normal Gaussian distributions smoothes the zeroprobability regions ofthe original discrete distributions, thus solving the divergence problem. Theparameters of the Gaussian smoothing can be determined experimentally,or derived from statistical considerations where such measurements arenot available.656544, Session 9An orthogonal subspace projectionbased for estimation ofvirtual dimensionality for hyperspectral data exploitationW. Liu, C. Wu, C. Chang, Univ. of MarylandBaltimore CountyA recently introduced concept, Virtual Dimensionality VD has been shownpromise in many applications of hyperspectral data exploitation. It wasoriginally developed for estimating number of spectrally distinct signalsources. This paper explores the utility of the VD and develops a newversatile technique for estimating the VD. It is derived from orthogonalprojection subspace OSPbased linear spectral mixture analysis wherethe assumed number of signatures or signal sources is used to generate asubspace space that embraces as many data sample vectors as mixedpixels. It is closely related and also determined by the algorithm used togenerate the subspace projection. In other words, different used algorithmsproduce different values of the VD. This is a significant key feature that isnot included in any other method used to estimate the VD in the literature.For example, if an algorithm used to generate the subspace is anendmember extraction algorithm, then the VD will represent the number ofendmembers. On the other hand, if an algorithm used to generate thesubspace is a target detection algorithm, then the VD will represent thenumber of spectral distinct targets. In order to evaluate the performance ofthe proposed OSPbased  VD estimation technique, a comparative studyand analysis is conducted via synthetic and real image.Conf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 255656545, Session 9Dimensionality expansion in hyperspectral imagery usingreal and imaginary complex transformationsA. Castrodad, E. H. Bosch, R. G. Resmini, National GeospatialIntelligence AgencySeveral studies have reported that the use of derived spectral features,in addition to the original hyperspectral data, can facilitate theseparation of similar classes. Dimension expansion methods areemployed to project data to a higherdimensional space with theexpectation the decision surface separating similar classes becomewell defined. Therefore, the problem of discerning between similarclasses in expanded space becomes more tractable. Some of the mostcommon dimension expansion methods include linear and nonlinearcombinations of the original spectral data. Recent work presented byone of the authors discusses a hyperspectral image HSI dimensionexpansion technique based on generating real and imaginary complexfeatures from the original spectral signatures. In turn, a complexspectral angle mapper was employed to classify the dimensionexpanded data. In this paper, we extend this method to include otherapproaches of generating complex spectral features from the originaldata, such as the Fourier Transform FT, complex exponentials,complex logarithms and possibly analytic holomorphictransformations. We also investigate supervised class separationmethods such as the Euclidean Distance, and others that require thecomputation of higher order statistics e.g. complex covariance matrix,such as the Mahalanobis or the Battacharrya Distance.  Results will bepresented with real HSI data.656546, Session 10Wavelength calibration of hyperspectral sensors with 2Ddetector arraysE. Lo, Susquehanna Univ. A. W. Fountain III, U.S. Army Research,Development and Engineering Command J. Ingram, U.S. MilitaryAcademyA readily automated procedure for testing and calibrating thewavelength scale of a scanning hyperspectral imaging camera isdescribed. The procedure is a laboratory calibration method and it usesthe absorbance features from a commercial didydium oxide filter as awavelength standard. The procedure was used to accurately determinethe pixel positions. An algorithm was developed to determine the centerof the wavelength for any given abscissa and the accuracy of theestimated wavelength for a given calibration. During this investigationwe determined that the sampled pixels show both trend and serialcorrelation as a function of the spatial dimensions. The trend is moresignificant than the serial correlation. In this paper, the trend will befiltered out by modeling the trend using an efficient global linearregression model of different order for different spectral band. The orderis selected automatically and different criteria for selecting the order arediscussed. Experimental results will be presented to show theimprovement in the accuracy.656547, Session 10Processing misregistered hyperspectral dataJ. T. Casey, J. P. Kerekes, Rochester Institute of TechnologyMany hyperspectral sensors collect data using multiple spectrometersto provide broad spectral coverage. These spectrometers often haveseparate apertures defined by optical fibers leading to the multiplespectrometers. The airborne Modular Imaging Spectrometer InstrumentMISI, a 70 band line scanner built by the Rochester Institute ofTechnology RIT, is configured in this manner. Visible and near infraredspectrometers are each fed by their own optical fiber at the primaryfocal plane. A spatial offset between the two fibers causes an inherentmisregistration between the two sets of spectral bands. Thisconfiguration of MISI causes a relatively complicated misregistrationwhich cannot be corrected with a simple shift, rotation or translation ofthe data. In MISI, incident light from the ground is first reflected off of arotating scan mirror before an additional reflection from a fold mirrorand into the optical fibers. This geometry leads to a scan angledependent misregistration between the imagery in the twospectrometers. Coupled with roll, pitch, and yaw variations, andelevation changes in the ground surface, these effects make registrationand georectification of the imagery quite challenging. Also, themismatch between spectral channels severely degrades the spectralpurity of each pixel, and can particularly reduce performance in subpixel target detection applications. A geometric model of the sensor isbeing developed to solve for the misregistration and achieve imagerectification. This paper will address the issues in dealing with themisregistration, and the techniques used to improve spectral purity on aper pixel basis. Data collected by the MISI sensor over RITs campusare being used in research aimed at detecting and tracking potentiallythreatening civilian vehicles in an urban area based on their uniquespectral characteristics. This paper will also report on our efforts tocompare performance of existing target detection algorithms in thisapplication, particularly in the context of the misregistration betweenspectrometers. Several algorithms have been studied to determinewhich perform well ,and which fail, under these conditions. Preliminaryresults indicate statistical algorithms such as the adaptive coherenceestimator ACE, and Constrained Energy Minimization CEMoutperform signaturebased or geometrical detection algorithms.656548, Session 10Median spectralspatial bad pixel identification andreplacement for hyperspectral SWIR sensorsA. D. Fischer, NovaSol T. V. Downes, R. A. Leathers, NavalResearch Lab.Hyperspectral focal plane arrays typically contain many pixels that areexcessively noisy, dead, or exhibit poor signaltonoise performance incomparison to the majority.  These bad pixels can significantly impairthe performance of spectral targetdetection algorithms.  Even a singlemissed bad pixel can lead to false alarms.  Because of this sensitivity tobad pixels, a completely automated approach for identifying andreplacing bad pixels has remained elusive.If the bad pixels are sparsely populated across the focal plane, the oversampling in both spatial and spectral dimensions of the array can becapitalized upon to replace these pixels without significant loss ofinformation.  However, bad pixels are frequently localized in clusters,requiring a replacement strategy that rather than providing a goodestimate of the missing data will instead minimize artifacts that maynegatively affect the performance of spectral detection algorithms.In this paper, we evaluate a robust method to automatically identify badpixels for shortwavelength infrared SWIR hyperspectral sensors.  Inaddition, we introduce a novel procedure for the replacement of thesepixels, which we demonstrate provides a better estimate of the originalpixel value compared to interpolation methods for bad pixels found asboth isolated individuals and in clusters.The advantages of our technique are discussed and demonstrated withdata from several different airborne sensor systems.656549, Session 10Spatial misregistration detection for hyperspectralsensors using inflight dataF. DellEndice, J. Nieke, D. R. Schlpfer, K. I. Itten, Univ. of ZrichSwitzerlandHyperspectral pushbroom sensors suffer from a number of artifactswhich can prevent the accurate record of the total upwelling radiancefor each groundspot. We focus our attention mainly on spatialmisregistration, also called keystone. Spatial misregistration is the sumof both optical aberrations, introduced by lens and mirrors, andmisalignments, due to assembling procedures, between the opticalparts of a sensor.The physical causes of this artifact are presented, and it is shown how itdoes depend quadratically on the positions where the light rays hit thefocal plane. An inflight calibration method, able to identify spatialmisregistration in hyperspectral cubes, has been implemented, and itwill be used in the hyperspectral sensor Airborne Prism ExperimentConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII256 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssAPEX. This procedure combines edge detection, and weightedsummation to achieve subpixel precision. The main advantage of thisprocessor is that it tries to give an absolute measure of spatialmisregistration. The proposed inflight method is also easy to beadapted to other sensors in fact, it has been tested on large variety ofhyperspectral instruments. We namely analyze pushbroom scanningsystem, either gratingbased design HYSPEX, PHILLS, AISA Eagle,HYPERION, or prismbased design CASI3, CHRIS with AVIRIS as theonly whiskbroom scanner, which has been used as a benchmark for theproposed inflight detection method. The results confirm the quadraticdependence of spatial misregistration on the focal plane position, andbasically how its distribution, along the CCD elements, is symmetricalwithin the focal plane itself. The influence of filtering in gratingbaseddesigns is also shown as well as identification of misalignmentsbetween the focal plane, and other optical components.656550, Session 10Coregistration of multispectral images for enhancedtarget recognitionF. Khaghani, Solid State Scientific Corp. and Tufts Univ. R. J.Nelson, Solid State Scientific Corp.Unlike straightforward registration problems encountered in broadbandimaging, spectral imaging in fielded instruments often suffers from acombination of imaging aberrations that make spatial coregistration ofthe images a challenging problem.  Depending on the sensorarchitecture, typical problems to be mitigated include differing focus,magnification, and warping between the images in the various spectralbands due to optics differences scene shift between spectral imagesdue to parallax and scene shift due to temporal misregistrationbetween the spectral images.  However, typical spectral imagessometimes contain scene commonalities that can be exploited intraditional ways.  As a first step toward automatic scene coregistrationfor spectral images, we exploit manuallyselected scene commonalitiesto produce transformation parameters in a fourchannel spectral imager.The four bands consist of two midwave infrared channels and twoshortwave infrared channels, and employ a common snapshotmodefocal plane array to mitigate scene shift problems due to temporalmisregistration.  Each of the four bands is blurred differently due todiffering focal lengths of the imaging optics, magnified differently,warped differently, and translated differently due to parallax.  Centroidlocation techniques are used on the scene commonalities in order togenerate subpixel values for the fiducial markers used in thetransformation polygons, and conclusions are drawn about theeffectiveness of such techniques in spectral imaging applications.656551, Session 11Recent theoretical advances in analysis of AIRSAMSUsounding dataJ. Susskind, NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr.The AIRS Science Team Version 5.0 retrieval algorithm will becomeoperational at the Goddard DAAC in early 2007 in the near realtimeanalysis of AIRSAMSU sounding data.  This algorithm contains manysignificant theoretical advances over the AIRS Science Team Version4.0 retrieval algorithm used previously.  Two very significantdevelopments are 1 the development and implementation of a veryaccurate Radiative Transfer Algorithm RTA which allows for accuratetreatment of nonLocal Thermodynamic Equilibrium nonLTE effects onshortwave sounding channels and 2 the development of methodologyto obtain very accurate case by case product error estimates which arein turn used for quality control.  These theoretical improvements takentogether enabled a new methodology to be developed which furtherimproves soundings in partially cloudy conditions, without the use ofmicrowave observations in the cloud clearing step as has been donepreviously.  In this methodology, longwave CO2 channel observations inthe spectral region 700 cm1 to 750 cm1 are used exclusively for cloudclearing purposes, while shortwave CO2 channels in the spectral region2195 cm1 to 2395 cm1 are used for temperature sounding purposes.The new methodology will be described briefly and results will beshown, including comparison with those using AIRS Version 4 , as wellas a forecast impact experiment assimilating AIRS Version 5.0 retrievalproducts in the Goddard GEOS 5 Data Assimilation System.656552, Session 11Utility of AIRS retrievals for climate studiesG.

Thus, one mayexpect that their rapidly growing datasets could provide crucial insightsnot only for shortterm weather processespredictions but into ongoingand future climate change processes as well.  Though Earthobservingsatellites have been around for decades, extracting climatically reliableinformation from their widely varying datasets faces rather formidablechallenges.

On the otherhand, we are also working on its backward extension, by integrating itwith the other sounderbased climate dataset, namely the TOVSPathfinder PathA retrievals, available from 1979 through 2004.First we present internal consistency checks by evaluating the 4yrlong time series of global and tropical means, as well as gridscalevariability and trends of the retrieved atmospheric parameters.

T. Zavodsky, NASA Marshall Space Flight Ctr. and The Univ. ofAlabamaHuntsville S. Chou, G. J. Jedlovec, W. Lapenta, NASAMarshall Space Flight Ctr.The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS, together with the AdvancedMicrowave Sounding Unit AMSU, represents one of the mostadvanced spacebased atmospheric sounding systems.  Aside frommonitoring changes in Earths climate, one of the objectives of AIRS isto provide sounding information with sufficient accuracy such that theassimilation of the new observations, especially in data sparse regions,will lead to an improvement in weather forecasts.  The combined AIRSAMSU system provides radiance measurements used as input to asophisticated retrieval scheme which has been shown to producetemperature profiles with an accuracy of 1 K over 1 km layers andhumidity profiles with accuracy of 15 in 2 km layers in both clear andpartly cloudy conditions.  The retrieval algorithm also providesestimates of the accuracy of the retrieved values at each pressure level,allowing the user to select profiles based on the required errortolerances of the application.The purpose of this paper is to describe a procedure to optimallyassimilate highresolution AIRS profile data in a regional analysisforecast model.

L. Strow, S. Hannon, Univ. of MarylandBaltimore CountyThe Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS has been operating onNASAa AQUA satellite since Sept. 2002.  AIRS is a gratingspectrometer with a nominal resolving power of 1200, and wasdeveloped to retrieve atmospheric profiles of temperature and watervapor.  However, since AIRS covers much of the infrared spectrum from3.7 to 15 microns, information on the abundance of several minor gasesis possible.  We will present retrievals of sulfur dioxide and nitric acidusing AIRS and discuss characteristics of the retrieval algorithm andcrossvalidation using the OMI and MLS sensors on the NASA AURAsatellite.  Observations of volcanic dust plumes with AIRS will also bediscussed.656555, Session 11Analysis of SO2 point source emissions using NASAatmospheric infrared sounder dataS. S. Shen, The Aerospace Corp. D. P. Miller, Northrop GrummanCorp. P. E. Lewis, National GeospatialIntelligence AgencyDetermining the extent to which large power plant emission sourcesinteracting with atmospheric constituents affect the environment willplay a significant role in future U.S. energy production policy. Theeffects on the environment caused by the interaction between thepower plant emissions and the atmospheric constituents has not beeninvestigated in depth due to the lack of calibrated spectral data on asuitable temporal and spatial scale. The availability of NASAs spacebased Atmospheric Infrared Sounder AIRS data makes it possible toexplore, and begin the first steps toward establishing, a correlationbetween known emission sources and environmental indicators. Forthis study, a time series of 26 cloudfree AIRS data containing two coalfired power plants in northern New Mexico were selected, acquired, andanalyzed for SO2 emissions. A generic forward modeling process wasalso developed to derive an estimate of the expected AIRS pixelradiance containing the SO2 emissions from the two power plantsbased on published combustion analysis data for coal and availablepower plant documentation. Analysis of the AIRS NER calculated inthis study and subsequent comparison with the radiance values for SO2calculated from the forward model provided essential informationregarding the suitability and risk in the use of a modified AIRSconfiguration for monitoring anthropogenic point source emissions. Thisstudy along with its conclusions and recommendations in conjunctionwith additional research collaboration with the NASA AIRS ScienceTeam in several specific topics will provide guidance for thedevelopment of the next generation infrared spectrometer system thatNASA is considering building for environmental monitoring.656556, Session 11Advanced remotesensing imaging emissionspectrometer ARIES AIRS spectral resolution withMODIS spatial resolutionT. S. Pagano, Jet Propulsion Lab.The Advanced Remotesensing Imaging Emission SpectrometerARIES will measure the primary earth quantities fundamental to thestudy of global climate change including atmospheric water vapor andtemperature, atmospheric composition of key gases, and land andocean productivity.  It will build upon the success of the ModerateResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS and the AtmosphericInfrared Sounder AIRS instruments currently flying on the EOS AquaSpacecraft.  Both MODIS and AIRS are facility instruments for NASAproviding data to thousands of users investigating land, ocean andatmospheric Earth System processes.  ARIES will meet all therequirements of AIRS and MODIS in a single compact instrument, whileproviding the nextgeneration capability of improved spatial andspectral resolution for AIRS and improved spectral resolution forMODIS.The NASA MODIS and AIRS key facility instruments on the EOS Aquaspacecraft have made significant advancements in Earth Science andweather forecasting.  The ARIES instrument concept will not only assurethe continued climate quality observations of MODIS and AIRS forscience research, but offer hyperspectral resolution from the Vis throughthe LWIR at MODIS spatial resolution or better.  This new capability willenable new scientific discovery by the broad community of existingusers of AIRS and MODIS resulting in major contributions to EarthScience for the next decade.  This paper presents the measurementrequirements from ARIES and a concept for meeting the requirements.656557, Session 11Recent progress in neural network estimation ofatmospheric profiles using microwave and hyperspectralinfrared sounding data in the presence of cloudsW. J. Blackwell, F. W. Chen, MIT Lincoln Lab.Recent work has demonstrated the feasibility of neural networkestimation techniques for atmospheric profiling in partially cloudyatmospheres using combined microwave MW and hyperspectralinfrared IR sounding data.  In this paper, the retrieval performance inproblem areas over land, near the poles, elevated terrain, etc. isexamined.  Simulated data generated for these conditions is used tosupplement the data set used in previous experiments, whichunderrepresented the most difficult cases because of data sparsity inthese regions.A novel statistical method for the retrieval of atmospheric temperatureand moisture relative humidity profiles has been developed andevaluated with sounding data from the Atmospheric InfraRed SounderAIRS and the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit AMSU. Thepresent work focuses on the cloud impact on the AIRS radiances andexplores the use of stochastic cloud clearing mechanisms together withneural network estimation. A standalone statistical algorithm will bepresented that operates directly on cloudimpacted AIRSAMSU data,with no need for a physical cloud clearing process. The algorithm isimplemented in three stages.  First, the infrared radiance perturbationsdue to clouds are estimated and corrected by combined processing ofthe infrared and microwave data using a Stochastic Cloud ClearingSCC approach. The cloud clearing of the infrared radiances wasperformed using principal components analysis of infrared brightnesstemperature contrasts in adjacent fields of view and microwavederivedestimates of the infrared clearcolumn radiances to estimate and correctthe radiance contamination introduced by clouds.  Second, a ProjectedPrincipal Components PPC transform is used to reduce thedimensionality of and optimally extract geophysical profile informationfrom the cloudcleared infrared radiance data.  Third, an artificialfeedforward neural network NN is used to estimate the desiredgeophysical parameters from the projected principal components.The performance of this method was evaluated using global ascendingand descending EOSAqua orbits colocated with ECMWF fields for avariety of days throughout 2003 and 2004.  Over 350,000 fields ofConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII258 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssregard 3x3 arrays of footprints over ocean and land were used in thestudy.  Retrieval performance compares favorably with that obtainedwith simulated observations from the NOAA88b radiosonde set ofapproximately 7500 profiles.  The method requires significantly lesscomputation than traditional variational retrieval methods, whileachieving comparable performance.656558, Session 12Using the MODTRANtm5 radiative transfer algorithm forNASA satellite data analyses AIRS and SORCEG.

Acharya, Spectral Sciences, Inc.The opportunity to test MODTRANtm5 MOD5 capabilities againstNASAs satellite stateoftheart radiance and irradiance measurementshas recently been undertaken with the newly cleared code.  New solardata are from  1 SORCE satellite measurements of solar variabilityover solar rotation cycle, and 2 ultranarrow calculation of a new solarsource irradiance, extending over the full MOD5 spectral range, from0.2 um to farIR.  The AIRS data presented at SPIE 2006 have beensimilarly revisited with appropriate channel response functions.MODTRANtm5, MODerate resolution radiance and TRANsmittancecode, has been developed collaboratively by Air Force ResearchLaboratory and Spectral Sciences, Inc., with history dating back toLOWTRAN.  It includes approximations for all local thermodynamicequilibrium terms associated with molecular, cloud, aerosol and surfacecomponents for emission, scattering, and reflectance, including multiplescattering, refraction and a statistical implementation of Correlatedkaveraging.  The band model is based on 0.1 cm1 also 1.0, 5.0 and15.0 cm1 statistical binning for line centers within the interval,captured through an exact formulation of the full Voigt line shape.Spectroscopic parameters are from HITRAN 2004 with userdefinedoptions for additional gases.  Recent validation studies show MOD5replicates linebyline brightness temperatures to within 0.05Kaverage and 1.0K RMS.MOD5 can then serve as a surrogate for a variety of perturbationstudies, including the two modes for the solar source function, Io.Additionally, MOD5 calculations, using the truth data and satellitemeasurements supplied by the AIRS community, provide validation inthe Long Wave Infrared LWIR.  All 2400 instrument spectral responsefunctions ISRFs are expected to be supplied with MODTRANtm5.656559, Session 12Atmospheric correction of offNadir hyperspectralimageryS. M. AdlerGolden, L. S. Bernstein, M. W. Matthew, M. J. Fox, R. L.Sundberg, Spectral Sciences, Inc. A. J. Ratkowski, Air ForceResearch Lab.Compared to nadir viewing, offnadir viewing provides dramaticimprovement in the collection geometries obtainable from a givenremotesensing platform.  However, large offnadir angles lead tounusually large atmospheric absorption and scattering, which can bevery difficult to remove with standard atmospheric correctiontechniques.   To gain insight into the challenges and capabilities of offnadir atmospheric correction, we have recently studied a set ofHyperion hyperspectral images taken at an extreme offnadir angle 9 above the horizontal, performing atmospheric correction using both thefirstprinciples FLAASH method and the empirical QUAC method.Results of this investigation and implications for lessextreme viewinggeometries are discussed, and FLAASH upgrades for improvedhandling of offnadir geometries and other stressing scenarios aredescribed.656560, Session 12Error analysis for a temperature and emissivity retrievalalgorithm for hyperspectral imaging dataC. C. Borel, Ball Aerospace  Technologies Corp.In the hyperspectral thermal data analysis temperatureemissivityseparation has the same function as reflectance retrieval in the visible andshortwave infrared. The problem however is more complicated since in thethermal the surface emits radiation as well which depends on the skintemperature. The measured radiance is a function of the materials surfaceemissivity and temperature, reflected down welling radiance clear sky,clouds environment and the path radiance temperature and gas e.g.water vapor, ozone profiles. The current implementation of the AutomaticRetrieval of Temperature and EMIssivity using Spectral SmoothnessARTEMISS uses lookuptables LUT to compute the best fittingatmosphere which results in the smallest residual. Over last few years wehave developed an endtoend simulation of the hyper spectralexploitation process by generating synthetic data to simulate datasetswith known ground truth, modeling propagation through theatmosphere, adding sensor effects telescope, detector, readoutelectronics, radiometric and spectral calibration, and test the temperatureemissivity separation algorithm. We will present an error analysis where weshifted the band centers, varied the bandwidths FWHM, changed thespectral resolution, added noise and varied the atmospheric model. Wewill also discuss a general method to retrieve the spectral smile as afunction of wavelength and the FWHM from hyperspectral data with onlyapproximate spectral calibration. We found that our algorithm has troublefinding a unique solution when the watervapor exceeds about 3 gcm2and will discuss remedies for this situation. To speedup the LUTgeneration we have developed fast and robust initial atmosphericparameter estimators water vapor, ozone, near surface atmospheric layertemperature based on channel ratios and brightness temperatures inatmospheric absorption regions for the LWIR.656561, Session 12Modeling and estimation of adjacency effects in aerialimagesH. Chandra, Univ. of CaliforniaIrvineThis paper presents a physics based model to estimate the adjacencyeffect in aerial images. Radiations scattered by a ground surface out of thefield of view FOV, sometimes, get scattered by the atmosphere back intothe FOV. The term adjacencyeffect is used to describe this phenomenon. Adjacency effects can leadto image blurs and low contrast in aerial images. This can make thequantitative explanation of surface features difficult. Modeling andestimation of adjacency effects can facilitate improved airborne imageanalysis. A new scenegeometry invariant, physics based adjacencymodel based on Radiative Transfer RT theory is proposed.The model is validated by comparing synthetic aerial image datagenerated using Digital Imaging and Remote Sensing Image GenerationDIRSIG with the real HYperspectral Digital Imagery Collection ExperimentHYDICE image data under various atmospheric and illuminationconditions. We use an error measure, defined as the difference betweenthe actual HYDICE radiance and the predicted HYDICE radiance, toquantitatively compare the two radiance measures, with and without theadjacency effects. For the test scenes, we consider grass background andcalibrated reflectance panels as our target objects. When we do notconsider the adjacency model, we show that the error measure is highnear the targetbackground boundaries whereas the error measure is verylow with the inclusion of the proposed adjacency model.656562, Session 12Correlatedkbased fast accurate bandpass radiance andtransmittance kURT calculations for scenesP. K. Acharya, R. Panfili, A. Berk, S. M. AdlerGolden, SpectralSciences, Inc. A. Wetmore, R. C. Shirkey, Army Research Lab.The ability to rapidly calculate atsensor radiance over a large number oflines of sight LOSs is critical for scene simulations, which are increasinglyConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 259used for sensor design, performance evaluation, and data analysis.  Wehave recently demonstrated a new radiation transport RT capabilitythat combines an efficient multipleLOS multiple scattering algorithmwith a broadbandpass correlatedk methodology called kURTMS.  ThemultipleLOS capability is based on DISORT and exploits the existingMODTRANDISORT interface. kURTMS is a new sensorspecificcorrelatedk ck ultrafast radiative transfer formalism for UVvisible toLWIR wavelengths that is derived from MODTRANs correlatedkparameters.  Scattering parameters, blackbody and solar functions arecast as compact kdependent source terms and used in the radiancecomputations. Preliminary transmittance results are within 2 ofMODTRAN with a twoordersofmagnitude computational savings.Preliminary radiance computations in the visible spectrum  are within afew percent of  MODTRAN results, but with orders of magnitude speedup over  comparable MODTRAN runs.  This new RT capability haspotential applications for hyperspectral scene simulations as well astarget acquisition algorithms for near earth  scenarios.656563, Session 13Analysis of hyperspectral change and target detection asaffected by vegetation and illumination variationsJ. Meola, Air Force Research Lab.This paper covers the use of detection algorithms on hyperspectral dataof a scene collected over several seasons.  The effectiveness of specifictarget detection algorithms on scenes with different illuminationconditions such as shadows, low sun angles, and seasonal vegetationchanges is examined.  Various algorithms are currently employed todetect anomalies within a scene.  Specifically, a simple Mahalanobisdistance measure and spectral matched filter algorithm are oftenemployed on hyperspectral data to detect specific objects within ascene.  These algorithms are limited to use on a single scene acquiredat a specific time.  When hyperspectral data from the same scene atdifferent times is available, more sophisticated algorithms utilizing linearpredictors such as chronochrome and covariance equalization are usedfor detection.  These change detection algorithms attempt to suppressbackground in order to focus on more prominent alterations within thescene.Using a pushbroom style imaging spectrometer mounted on a pan andtilt, visible to near infrared data of a scene containing specific objects isgathered.  Hyperspectral system characterization and calibration isperformed to ensure viable data is produced.  Data collection occursfrom late August 2005 until May 2006 to obtain a wide range ofillumination and vegetation conditions.  After collecting and calibratingthe scene data, the change detection algorithms are employed toassess background suppression for various conditions.  These sceneconditions can include daily illumination change, seasonal illuminationchange, and seasonal vegetation change.  Often, the chronochromeand covariance equalization predictors work well for certain portions ofthe scene but struggle in others.  This result demonstrates how areas ofa scene may undergo different temporal transformations.   In addition,comparing the change detection algorithms to single instance methodsallows for the assessment of any advantages offered by a specificmethod.  Using a signal to clutter ratio, the various algorithms areevaluated and conclusions are drawn.656564, Session 13Use of spectral clustering to enhance cluttersuppressionM. T. Eismann, Air Force Research Lab.Hyperspectral change detection has been shown to be promisingapproach for detecting subtle targets in complex backgrounds.Reported change detection methods are typically based on linearpredictors that assume a spaceinvariant affine transformation betweenimage pairs.  Unfortunately, several physical mechanisms can lead tosignificant space variance in the spectral change associated withbackground clutter, including shadowing and other illuminationvariations as well as seasonal impacts on the spectral nature ofvegetation, and this can lead to poor change detection performance.This paper outlines a methodology to deal with such spacevariantchange using spectral clustering and other related leastsquaresoptimization techniques.  Several specific algorithms are developed andapplied to change imagery captured under controlled conditions, andthe impacts on clutter suppression are quantified and compared.  Theresults indicate that such techniques can provide markedly increasedclutter suppression when the environmental conditions associated withthe image pairs are substantially different.656565, Session 13Resampling approach for anomalous change detectionJ. Theiler, S. J. Perkins, Los Alamos National Lab.We investigate the problem of identifying pixels in pairs of coregisteredimages that correspond to real changes on the ground. Changes thatare due to environmental differences illumination, atmosphericdistortion, etc. or sensor differences focus, contrast, etc.  will bewidespread throughout the image, and the aim is to avoid thesechanges in favor of changes that occur in only one or a few pixels.Formal outlier detection schemes such as the oneclass support vectormachine can identify rare occurrences, but will be confounded bypixels that are equally rare in both images they may be anomalous,but they are not changes.  We describe a resampling scheme we havedeveloped that formally addresses both of these issues, and reducesthe problem to a binary classification, a problem for which a largevariety of machine learning tools have been developed.  In principle, theeffects of misregistration will manifest themselves as pervasivechanges, and our method will be robust against them  but in practice,misregistration is a serious issue, and we will describe efforts toameliorate its effects.656566, Session 13An FPGA implementation of image space reconstructionalgorithm for hyperspectral imaging analysisJ. Morales, N. G. Santiago, A. Fernandez, Univ. de Puerto RicoMayagezThe Image Space Reconstruction Algorithm ISRA has been used inhyperspectral imaging applications to monitor changes in theenvironment and specifically, changes in coral reef, mangrove, and sandin coastal areas. This algorithm is one of the set of iterative methodsused in the hyperspectral imaging area to estimate abundance.However, ISRA is highly computational, making it difficult to obtainresults in a timely manner. In this paper we present the use ofspecialized hardware in the implementation of this algorithm,specifically the use of VHDL and FPGAs. The implementation of ISRAalgorithm has been divided into hardware and software units. Thehardware units were implemented on a Xilinx Virtex II Pro XC2VP30FPGA and the software was implemented on the Xilinx Microblaze softprocessor. This case study illustrates the feasibility of this alternativedesign for iterative hyperspectral imaging algorithms. The mainbottleneck found in this implementation was data transfer.656567, Session 13Maintaining CFAR operation in hyperspectral targetdetectionD. G. Manolakis, D. Zhang, MIT Lincoln Lab.One of the primary motivations for statistical LWIR backgroundcharacterization studies is to support the design, evaluation, andimplementation of algorithms for the detection of various types ofground targets.  Typically, detection is accomplished by comparing thedetection statistic for each test pixel to a threshold. If the statisticexceeds the threshold, a potential target is declared. The threshold isusually selected to achieve a given probability of false alarm. Inaddition, in surveillance applications, it is almost always required thatthe system will maintain a constant false alarm rate CFAR as thebackground distribution changes. This objective is usuallyaccomplished by adaptively estimating the background statistics andadjusting the threshold accordingly. In this paper we propose and studyConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII260 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssCFAR threshold selection techniques, based on tail extrapolation, for amatched filter operating on hyperspectral imaging data. The basic ideais to obtain reliable estimates of the background statistics at low falsealarm rates, and then extend these estimates beyond the rangesupported by the data to predict the thresholds at lower false alarmrates.  The proposed techniques are based on the assumption that thedistribution in the tail region of the matched filter statistics is accuratelycharacterized by a member of the extreme value distributions. We focuson the generalized Pareto distribution. The evaluation of the proposedtechniques will be done with both simulated data and real hyperspectralimaging data collected using the AVIRIS sensor and the Army NightVision Laboratory COMPASS sensor.656569, Session 14Detecting changes in scenes using autonomous smartcamerasH.

Sains MalaysiaMalaysiaThis study determined the relationship between in situ and remotesensing observation to derive an algorithm for PM10 mapping. Themain objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using LandsatTM imagery captured on 17 January 2002 for PM10 mapping overPenang Island, Malaysia. A new algorithm was developed based on theaerosol characteristic for air quality estimation. The correspondingPM10 data were measured simultaneously with the acquisition ofsatellite scene for algorithm regression analysis. Accuracy of theretrieved surface reflectance values is very importance to determine theatmospheric component from the remotely sensed data. In this study,we computed the surface component properties by using ACTOR2 inthe PCI Geomatica 9.1 image processing software. The proposedalgorithm produced high correlation coefficient R and low rootmeansquare error RMS between the measured and estimated PM10 values.A PM10 map was generated using the proposed algorithm. Finally, thecreated PM10 map was geometrically corrected and colourcoded forvisual interpretation. This study indicated the usefulness of remotelysensed data for air quality studies using the proposed algorithm.656571, Session 14PM10 retrieval over the water surface of Penang StraitsH. S. Lim, M. Z. Mat Jafri, K. Abdullah, Univ. Sains MalaysiaMalaysiaIn this study, we used the Landsat TM data captured on 9 March 2006for the retrieval of PM10 over the water surface of Penang Straits,Malaysia. PM10 measurements were collected using a handheldDustTrakTM meter simultaneously with the remotely sensed dataacquisition. The PCI Geomatica version 9.1 digital image processingsoftware was used in all imageprocessing analysis. An algorithm wasdeveloped based on the atmospheric optical characteristic. The digitalnumbers were extracted corresponding to the groundtruth locations foreach band and then converted into radiance and reflectance values.The reflectance measured from the satellite reflectance at the top ofatmospheric,   TOA was subtracted by the amount given by thesurface reflectance to obtain the atmospheric reflectance. Then theatmospheric reflectance was related to the PM10 using regressionanalysis. These atmospheric reflectance values were used forcalibration of the PM10 algorithm. The developed algorithm was usedto correlate the digital signal and the PM10 concentration. Theproposed algorithm produced a high correlation coefficient R and lowrootmeansquare error RMS. The PM10 concentration was generatedusing this algorithm over the water surface of Penang straits.656572, Session 15Framework development for spectral libraries of naturalhyperspectral backgroundsM. A. Glennon, J. J. Cipar, Air Force Research Lab. D. G.Manolakis, MIT Lincoln Lab. R. B. Lockwood, Air Force ResearchLab. P. Grisgby, J. Jacobson, NASICDEKAThe reflectance spectra of natural backgrounds are often assumed tobe drawn from a multivariate normal population, characterized by amean spectrum and covariance matrix.   Recent work has shown thateven for background populations carefully screened using clusteringalgorithms, significant spectral outliers are present.  These outlierssuggest that the normal distribution model is not adequate and thatmore sophisticated distributions are required.  In a prior study, statisticalproperties of natural hyperspectral backgrounds were modeled withdistinct combinations of Gaussian body and telliptically contoureddistributions, representing the heaviness of the tails.  Moreover, intrinsicvariability in hyperspectral backgrounds are required input to realisticmodeling efforts.   For example, performance evaluation of algorithmsfor hyperspectral imaging sensors depends on the characteristics ofbackground distributions.   The goal of this paper is to develop theframework for spectral libraries of natural backgrounds using a smallnumber of parameters and to demonstrate that enough information hasbeen captured to reproduce the full variability of the dataset.We will present examples of background spectral libraries developedfrom lowaltitude AVIRIS imagery along with required metadata.   Next,the spectral statistics of the original reflectance spectra will be used topredict atsensor radiance using the radiative transfer code,MODTRAN.  The challenge will be to ensure that the observed variabilityin the imagery has been captured by the statistics and associatedmetadata.656573, Session 15Random sampling statistical analysis for adaptive targetscaleinvariant hyperspectral anomaly detectionJ. M. Romano, U.S. Army Armament Research, Development andEngineering Ctr. D. S. Rosario, Army Research Lab.The proposed paper focuses on the autonomous clutter backgroundcharacterization ACBC achieved by a random sampling model and aparallel process to mitigate the inclusion of target samples by chanceinto clutter background classes during the process of randomlysampling the input imagery. This method handles underlying difficultiese.g., target scale uncertainties facing the development of autonomousanomaly detection algorithm. Suppose an N number of spectrum setsare randomly collected from the imagery, such that each set is testedagainst spectra from a window that moves across the imagery yieldingN output surfaces from an anomaly detector. These N surfaces arefused by retaining the piecewise minimum at each pixel location,producing a single output surface FMIN. In FMIN, blocks of data in theoriginal imagery that are significantly different from the sampled N setsshould be accentuated with respect to the spatial locations of theclutter background. To minimize the suppression probability of targets inthe imagery by chance, a parallel process is introduced to repeat thissampling process M number of times and to yield a decision surface byadding these M FMIN surfaces. The rationale here is that the likelihoodof suppressing the presence of targets in all M FMIN surfaces is smallbut real, and the motivation for proposing such scheme, rather thancomparing blocks of data across the imagery against data surroundingthese blocks, is that target scales are unknown and may vary in a shortperiod of time for many Army Applications.Conf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 261656574, Session 15A comparative study and analysis between vertexcomponent analysis and orthogonal subspace projectionfor endmember extractionC. Wu, W. Liu, Univ. of MarylandBaltimore County H. Ren, NationalCentral Univ. Taiwan C. Chang, Univ. of MarylandBaltimoreCountyEndmember extraction has received considerable interest in recentyears. Of particular interest is the Pixel Purity Index PPI because of itspublicity and availability in ENVI software. There are also many variantsof the PPI have been developed. Among them is an interestingendmember extraction algorithm EEA, called vertex componentanalysis VCA developed by Dias and Nascimento who extend the PPIto a simplexbased EEA while using orthogonal subspace projectionOSP as a projection criterion rather than simplex volume used byanother wellknown EEA, Nfinder algorithm NFINDR developed byWinter.  Interestingly, this paper will show that the VCA is essentially thesame algorithm, referred to as Automatic Target Generation ProcessATGP recently developed for automatic target detection andclassification by Ren and Chang except the use of the initial conditionto initialize the algorithm. In order to substantiate our findings,experiments using synthetic and real images are conducted for acomparative study and analysis.656575, Session 15Impact of missing endmembers on the performance ofthe OSP detector for hyperspectral imagesP. Bajorski, Rochester Institute of TechnologyIn evaluating the performance of the detectors such as the orthogonalsubspace projection OSP detector, it is often assumed that the modelunder which the detector is constructed is the correct model. However,in practice, the ability to identify all background endmembers might belimited. Consequently, the OSP detector would use only a subset of allbackground endmembers. This clearly creates suboptimality of such adetector. In this paper, we perform analytical calculations that allow usto assess how much of the detection power is lost due to theunidentified background endmembers. An analytical comparison ismade between two OSP detectorsone using only the identifiedendmembers and the other one using even a smaller set ofendmembers in order to simulate the situation when only the smallerset of endmembers is identified.656576, Session 15Statistical models for LWIR hyperspectral backgroundsand their applications in chemical agent detectionD.

We considermodels based on the theory of elliptically contoured distributions andthe theory of extreme value distributions.  Both models can handleheavy tails, which is a key feature of hyperspectral imagingbackgrounds. The paper provides a concise description of theunderlying models, the algorithms used to estimate their parametersfrom the background spectral measurements, evaluation of thegoodnessoffit, and the use of the developed models in the design andevaluation of chemical warfare agent detection algorithms.656577, Poster SessionComparison among some anomaly detectionapproaches for hyperspectral imageryS. R. Soofbaf, H. Fahimnejad, M. J. Valadan Zoej, B. Mojaradi, K.N.Toosi Univ. of Technology IranNowadays the use of hyperspectral imagery specifically automatictarget detection algorithms for these images is a relatively exciting areaof research.An important challenge of hyperspectral target detection is to detectsmall targets without any prior knowledge, particularly when theinterested targets are insignificant with low probabilities ofoccurrence.The specific characteristic of anomaly detection is that itdoes not require atmospheric correction and signature libraries.Recently, several useful applications of anomaly detection approacheshave been developed in remote sensing.With this in mind, in this paper some anomaly detectors such as RXbased anomaly detectors, GaussMarkov random field GMRFmodel,CFT model,as well as adaptive anomaly detectors,are compared.Finally the most efficient method is proposed for implementation in aplanned software system.656578, Poster SessionFast implementation of NFINDR algorithm forendmember determination in hyperspectral imageryA. Chowdhury, M. S. Alam, Univ. of South AlabamaHyperspectral image processing systems require the extraction ofcertain basis spectra, called endmembers, which are assumed to bepure signatures in the image data. NFINDR algorithm is one of themost widely used endmember extraction algorithm. This algorithm isbased on the fact that in L spectral dimensions, the Ldimensionalvolume contained by a simplex formed of the purest pixels is larger thanany other volume formed from any other combination of pixels.Recently developed virtual dimensionality VD algorithm is used todetermine the number of endmembers present in the dataset and anendmember initialization algorithm EIA is used to select an appropriateset of pixels for initialization of the NFINDR technique, which improvesthe performance of the original algorithm. This paper proposes a fastalgorithm to implement the NFINDR technique using the VD algorithmto find the number of endmembers, N. Then we reduce thedimensionality of the hyperspectral dataset to N1 by using maximumnoise fraction MNF technique and then divide all the pixels into Nnumber of classes by using spectral angle mapping. We extract Nnumber of the most pure pixel from each group by classical NFINDRalgorithm but using an exhaustive searching method. Thus we getNN pixels that are most likely to be the endmembers. Classical NFINDR algorithm is then again applied on these selected pixels to findConf. 6565 Algorithms and Technologies for Multispectral, Hyperspectral,and Ultraspectral Imagery XIII262 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssthe final N endmembers. Grouping the pixels into several classes makesthe computation very fast. Since we extract N number of pixels fromeach group by exhaustive search, there is no possibility to loose anyendmember due to classification. The proposed algorithm has muchbetter computational efficiency than all the existing NFINDRalgorithms.656579, Poster SessionImproved forward floating selection algorithm fordetection in hyperspectral imageryS. Nakariyakul, D. P. Casasent, Carnegie Mellon Univ.We consider selecting useful features or wavebands in hyperspectraldata.  Since optimal feature selection algorithms are not feasible inhyperspectral data that contains hundreds of features, we propose thenew quasioptimal improved forward floating selection IFFS algorithm,which is an improvement on the wellknown sequential forward floatingselection algorithm.  Our IFFS algorithm is shown to give a higherperformance rate than other suboptimal feature selection algorithms.We test our IFFS algorithm to detect contamination on hyperspectralpoultry imagery. Our initial results indicate that our method gives anexcellent detection rate and performs better than other suboptimalfeature selection algorithms.656580, Poster SessionTarget detection in highdimensional space using astochastic expectation maximization algorithmM. Karakaya, M. S. Alam, M. I. Elbakary, Univ. of South AlabamaThis paper presents an object detection algorithm based on stochasticexpectationmaximization SEM algorithm. SEM algorithm is based onthe stochastic, expectation, and maximization steps to iterativelyestimate the parameters of the classes in many applications includinghyperspectral data cube HDC. However, the application of SEMalgorithm for classification of hyperspectral imagery becomesimpractical because of the huge amount of data e.g. 512 x 512 x 220.To avoid this problem, we proposed a preprocessing step for SEMalgorithm to fast classify the data cube formulating an Object Detectionalgorithm based on SEM for detecting small objects in hyperspectralimagery. In the proposed preprocessing step, we utilize the exponentialof Euclidian Distance for rapidly separation of data cube into a potentialobject of interest class and a background class. Then, SEM algorithm isemployed to classify the potential object of interest class further intoclasses to detect the object of interest class. In the conductedexperiments using real hyperspectral imagery, the results of theproposed algorithm show comparatively low false alarm rate even witha challenging scenarios.656581, Poster SessionChange detection for hyperspectral imageryA. K. Shaw, K. Vongsy, S. Karimkhan, Wright State Univ. D. Wicker,Air Force Research Lab.Change Detection CD is the process of identifying and examiningtemporal or spectral changes in signals. Detection and analysis ofchange provide valuable information of possible transformations in ascene.  Hyperspectral imaging HSI sensors are capable of collectinghundreds of narrow spectral bands of data. Such sensors provide highresolution spatial and spectrally rich information that can be exploitedfor Change Detection. This paper develops and analyzes various HSIalgorithms for the detection of changes using Hyperspectral images.For the validation and performance comparisons, changes obtained arecompared with the conventional similarity correlation coefficient as wellas traditional change detection algorithms, such as image differencing,image ratioing, and principle component analysis PCA methods.Another main objective is to incorporate Kernel based optimization byusing a nonlinear mapping function. Development of nonlinear versionsof linear algorithms allows exploiting nonlinear relationships present inthe data. The nonlinear versions, however, become computationallyintensive due to the high dimensionality of the feature space resulting inpart from application of the nonlinear mapping function. This problem isovercome by implementing these nonlinear algorithms in the highdimensional feature space in terms of kernels. Preliminary work ondismount tracking using change detection over successive HSI bandshas shown promising results. We study the Kernelization of a similaritycorrelation coefficient algorithm via Hyperspectral change detectionapplications for possible improvement in performance.656582, Poster SessionAutomated recognition and detection of dismounts andvehicles using closein urban hyperspectral imagesA. K. Shaw, S. Karimkhan, K. Vongsy, Wright State Univ. D. Wicker,Air Force Research Lab.Recent advances in Hyperspectral imaging HSI sensor offer newavenues for precise detection, identification and characterization ofmaterials or targets of military interest. HSI technologies are capable ofexploiting 10s to 100s of images of a scene collected at contiguous orselective spectral bands to seek out missioncritical objects. In thispaper, we develop and analyze novel HSI algorithms for detection,recognition and tracking of dismounts, vehicles and other manmadeobjects. Preliminary work on dismountvehicle detection has beenperformed using Principal Component Analysis PCA of visible bandHSI data and the results indicate improved performance with HSI whencompared to traditional EO processing. We plan to incorporate kernelbased optimization methods in order to improve detection andclassification performance. This is done by using what is known as thekerneltrick, which converts a linear classifier algorithm into a nonlinearone, by mapping the original observations into a higherdimensionalnonlinear space so that linear classification in the new space isequivalent to nonlinear classification in the original space. In additionto traditional HSI algorithms, such as PCA, Linear Discriminant Analysismethod LDA and Independent Component Analysis ICA, SpectralInformation Measure SIM, we study the Kernelization of theseapproaches for possible performance improvement.656583, Poster SessionEvaluation of PCA dimensionality reduction techniques inimaging spectroscopy for foreign object detectionO. M. Conde, M. Amado, P. B. GarciaAllende, A. Cobo, J. M.LpezHiguera, Univ. de Cantabria SpainForeign object detection processes are improving thanks to imagingspectroscopy techniques through the employment of hyperspectralsystems such as prismgratingprism spectrographs. These devicesoffer a valuable but sometimes huge and redundant amount of spectraland spatial information that facilitates the classification and sortingprocedures of materials in industrial production chains. Processingtechniques whose aim is the reduction of the number of significantspectral features will be desirable to accelerate the automaticclassification operations and to achieve realtime operation conditions.The spectral correlation that exists between the narrow spectral bandsin the hyperspectral image enables this dimensionality reduction. In thiswork different algorithms of supervised and nonsupervised PrincipalComponents Analysis PCA are thoroughly applied on theexperimentally acquired hyperspectral images. The evaluated PCAversions implement different statistical mechanisms to maximize theclass separability. PCA alternatives methodM, Jmeasure, Sepcor andSupervised PCA are compared evaluating how the achieved spectralcompression affects the classification performance in terms of accuracyand execution time. During the whole process, the classification stageis maintained and comprised by an Artificial Neural Network ANN. Thedeveloped techniques have been probed and successfully checked intobacco industry where detection of plastics, cords, cardboards,papers, textile threads, etc. must be done in order to enter only tobaccoleaves in the industrial chain.

Casasent, Carnegie Mellon Univ.In this paper, we examine the sensitivity of minimum noise and correlationenergy MINACE filters to different types of variations aspect view, scale,depression angle, and thermal state that are typically present in IRimagery.  Prior Minace ATR work has addressed at most twosimultaneous variations  aspect view and depression angle variations forSAR data, and aspect view and thermal state variations for IR data.iNo prior Minace ATR work has addressed scale variations.i  In ourtests, we consider up to three types of simultaneous variations, e.g.aspect view, scale and depression angle variations.  Our goal is todetermine if one Minace filter can handle all aspect view variations, and todetermine the range of scales and depression angles that a Minace filtercan handle before and after training on data at more than one scale and or depression angle.  We use our autoMinace algorithm that uses atraining and a validation set to select the Minace filter parameter ici which selects emphasis on recognition or discrimination and to selectthe training set images to be included in the filter, so that the filter canachieve both good recognition and good confuser and clutter rejectionperformance.  No confuser, clutter, or test set data are present in thetraining or the validation set.  We present test results using both real andCAD IR data we address the recognition of variants and the rejection ofconfuser objects and clutter in our tests.  We also present initial work onthe use of multiple aspect view filters per object.656604, Session 1Automatic aerial target detection and tracking system inairborne FLIR images based on efficient target trajectoryfilteringC. R. del BlancoAdan, F. F. Jaureguizar, L. L. Salgado, N. N. Garca,Grupo de Tratamiento de Imagenes SpainAn automatic detection and tracking system for aerial moving targets inairborne forwardlooking infrared images is presented. When clutter isabsent, so the background is a clear sky, common strategies offeraccurate results for the detection of aerial targets. On the other hand,when clouds and earth regions appear in the background, thosestrategies result in an overdetection which increases very significantlythe false alarm probability. However, the clutter is mainly static andtherefore it can be removed using a motionbased filtering strategy.Nevertheless, this procedure cannot be applied in airborne cameraswhere their movement yield a global motion in the sequences 12. In thiswork, an innovative and efficient target trajectory filtering with globalmotion compensation strategy is proposed, allowing to detect accuratelythe aerial targets and remove the static clutter in images with egomotion.Moreover, this strategy makes special emphasis in low complexityapproaches to implement a realtime system. The global motioncompensation is divided into three processing phases 123. Firstly, aselection of the image regions optimum for the compensation is carriedout. Secondly, the motion is estimated by a predictive diamondpatternsearch blockmatching technique 4, and the obtained motion vectors arefiltered through adaptive thresholding based on the image noiseestimation. Thirdly, a rigid transformation inferred from the motion vectorsfield is used to warp the image. After global motion compensation,potential aerial targets are detected through a combination of gradientand morphology based techniques. Finally, potential targets are trackedby template correlation techniques 5 and their trajectories areanalysed first filtering the data trajectory through a Kalman filter andthen applying a curve fitting technique 6, discarding the objects withno motion o erratic trajectory. Tests using the proposed strategy on realairtoair sequences show a dramatic reduction of the false alarm ratewhile maintaining the detection rate.1 E. Estalayo, L. Salgado, F. Jaureguizar, N. Garca.

Yu, Z. Yue, P. Topiwala, FastVDO LLCAdaBoost may be the most successful method for realtime objectdetection. However, its training procedure is very time consuming.Previous AdaBoost training methods use forward or floating search toselect the best several hundreds features out of millions of rectanglelike Haar feature candidates. The typical training time will be up toseveral weeks. Current greedy selection or float search method didntexploit the huge redundancy among the extracted features. Some264 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssresearcher use postprocessing method to remove the redundancy ofthe selected features after training. However, this wont decrease thetraining time. If most of redundant features can be removed by preprocessing feature selection without training, then the training time willbe greatly reduced. Due to the high dimension of the feature space,general wrapper approaches for feature selection will be extremelyslow. In this paper, we propose a hybrid feature selection method forAdaBoost object detection. First, the feature pool is clustered intosubsets based on the feature similarity. After that, using filter approachwith Fisher discrimant analysis, only partial of each cluster will beselected for training. During training, floating search will be integrated toavoid the nesting effect of forward search. The experimental results willvalidate the feasibility of the proposed feature selection method.Performance comparison will be done with FloatBoost and postprocessing feature selection using SVM.656607, Session 1Lowcomplexity motion analysis and segmentation fortarget detection using portable computing platformsP.

Ansari, Univ. of IllinoisChicagoResearch into methods that efficiently process imagery derived fromremote sensing systems has become exceedingly important due toincreasing data sizes, rates, and bit depths. Wavelets have beenstudied for compression for a number of years to address this needhowever, advanced processing that exploits the hierarchical, statistical,structural, and directional properties of advanced wavelets to facilitatetarget recognition has only recently begun to be explored.  This paperdescribes an algorithm that uses edge information derived fromdirectional wavelet decompositions to detect targets of knowndimension in electrooptical imagery. The decomposition is carried outusing a bank of filters with narrow wedgeshaped passbands that helpextract denoised edges of different orientations in the images. The edgeinformation is refined with the use of morphological operations afterwhich potential target regions are identified and features compared withavailable reference target information.  The approach highlights many ofthe benefits of working with advanced wavelet analysis, versustraditional Fourier and spatial domain processing, for image denoising,detection, and recognition.656609, Session 2Threedimensional passive sensing photon counting forobject classificationB.

Snorrason, Charles River Analytics, Inc.Automatic Target Recognition ATR algorithms are extremely sensitiveto differences between the operating conditions under which they aretrained and the extended operating conditions EOCs in which thefielded algorithms operate. These EOCs can cause a targets signatureto differ drastically from training exemplars, causing an ATR algorithmthat was specifically trained under one set of conditions to perform suboptimally under novel conditions. Rather than trying to create an ATR tohandle all EOCs, we can significantly improve recognition accuracy bydecomposing target recognition into solvable subproblems. Bysubdividing the training data and training a number of classifiers, eachexpert in a specific operating condition, we can leverage the power ofclassifiers to learn specifics about a dataset while limiting the amount ofgeneralization required from any one classifier.We have developed an ATR system, called Realtime AdaptiveClassification Environment using Rules RACER, which subdividestraining data based on characteristics of the data itself. Each subset oftraining samples is used to train an individual classifier, which is anexpert in the conditions represented by that training set. Each classifieradaptively selects the best features for classifying targets under itsspecific conditions. At runtime, RACER uses the same datacharacteristics to determine which conditions are represented in thetest sample. The expert classifier appropriate for the detectedconditions then uses its best features to classify the target. Wedemonstrate performance improvements for this method of adaptiveclassifier selection and discuss a number of design considerations foradaptive ATR systems.656611, Session 2Evaluation of the VIVID confirmatory identificationmoduleK.

Li, ConsultantThe ability of interferoceiver 1 to reveal micro Doppler signatures froma single radar pulse opens a new era in automatic target recognition.The present talk considers a real scenario to illustrate the power of suchability.  In July 3, 1988, a United States Navy battleship in the PersianGulf shot down an Iranian passenger plane.  The Navy said it mistook itfor a jet fighter. The incident killed all 290 people on board thepassenger plane.  The tragedy arose from battleship self defense toeliminate any perceived hostile aircraft within the guarded zone.This is a classical case of misidentification.  Micro Doppler signatures ofa jet fighter are completely different from those of a passenger plane.Conventional Doppler radar receivers, which are based on superheterodyne, cannot distinguish between those differences to avoid theabove tragedy.  It will be shown in the present talk that thedifferentiation can be easily accomplished through interferoceiver.Hence, the tragedy could have been avoided and the safety of thebattleship assured.1.

Gaunaurd, Army Research Lab.A flying platform illuminates a land mine field containing mixtures ofvarious types of landmines i.e., plastic or metallic, buried or on thesurface, etc and some confusers, with an ultrawideband UWB radar.The polarimetric echoes returned by the mine field,   mapped into asynthetic aperture radar SAR image, are then analyzed pixelbypixelby modern timefrequency tf techniques. The echoes of any of thescatterers in the field can be and have been analyzed by a number oftf distributions, which in turn generate twodimensional plots of eachscatterer in tf space. These plots are richer in information than those inthe original SAR image. Some tf distributions are better than others forthe present purpose of target classification. We find that the pseudoWignerVille and the ChoiWilliams distributions provide the bestdiscrimination results. Larger mines such as those here denoted type1 are easiest to identify. Using the above distributions, the distinctionbetween actual mines and clutter objects or confusers becomesclearer, particularly for metallic objects. Numerous images obtainedhere in tf space from realistic battlefield environments confirm theabove conclusions.656617, Session 3Feature extraction for classification of signalspropagating in channels with dispersion and dissipationG. Okopal, P. J. Loughlin, Univ. of PittsburghIn active sonar or radar, if the channel is spatiallyvarying e.g., shallowwater channels, then the received target echo will change withpropagation distance, such that identical target echoes may not beidentified as such if they propagated over different distances. Twocommon propagation effects that induce changes in the signal aredispersion and dissipation or damping, which give rise to frequencydependent velocity of propagation and frequencydependentattenuation, respectively.  We have previously developed a featureextraction process for target echoes in dispersive channels, to obtainmomentlike features that are invariant to dispersion, per mode.Accordingly, even though the target echo changes with propagation in adispersive channel, the dispersioninvariant moment features do not.However, these moment features are affected by damping.  In thispresentation, we consider the case of a channel with dispersion anddamping, and present methods to obtain features that areapproximately invariant to both phenomena.  Results are presentedfrom classification simulations to demonstrate the utility of thesefeatures.656618, Session 3Timevarying spectral moments and distributionsL. Cohen, Hunter CollegeCUNY K. L. Davidson, Office of NavalResearch P. J. Loughlin, Univ. of PittsburghA distribution is uniquely determined by its moments, except forpathological cases.  For timevarying signals many timefrequencydistributions have been defined and applied. Although thesedistributions do not have all of the properties of legitimate distributionsand hence are often called quasidistributions, they do satisfy many ofthese properties. One important property they satisfy is that theirmoments determine the distribution. However, as is the case withstandard probability distributions, a finite set of moments does notdetermine a particular distribution many distributions have the samemoments up to a fixed finite order. We examine the issue of timevarying spectral moments of signals, and address the followingquestions1. For a finite set of moments, how can one characterize the timefrequency distributions having these moments2. From all the possible distributions, which are the most effective inestimating important parameters such as the instantaneous frequencyand group delay, given a finite set of moments3. Which moments are robust to noise4. For the case of random processes, one defines a timevarying powerspectrum in contrast to a distribution. How can one use moments ofrandom signals to characterize the timevarying spectrum5. What are the conditions for a set of timevarying moments to beconsistent with each other the answer is known for the Wignerdistribution but not for other distributions656619, Session 4Pattern recognition in hyperspectral imagery using onedimensional maximum average correlation height filterand Mahalanobis distanceM.

This paper proposes a novel technique for target detection inhyperspectral imagery using one dimensional maximum averagecorrelation height MACH filter. MACH filter is a type of matched spatialfilter which has widely been used for spatial aperture radar, laser radar,forward looking infrared and other classes of twodimensional imagesConf. 6566 Automatic Target Recognition XVII266 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssto train and detect objects. We developed a modified onedimensionalMACH filter which is trained using likely variations of the target spectralsignatures by adding Gaussian noise to a given signature. Each pixelsof the input scene is then compared with the detection filter using theMahalanobis distance. Based on the distance between the trained filterand the pixels of the imagery, two classes are formed, named, thebackground class which does not contain a desired object, and theobject class which contains the desired object. By applying a thresholdboundary, a decision is then made whether a given pixel belongs to thebackground class or to the object class. The simulation results usingreal life hyperspectral imagery show that the proposed technique candetect and classify the desired objects with a high degree of efficiencyeven for very small and scattered targets.656621, Session 4Nonlinear unmixing of hypespectral data using BDRF andmaximum likelihood algorithmM. T. Rahman, M. S. Alam, Univ. of South AlabamaIn this paper, we proposed a non linear unmixing matching algorithmusing Bidirectional reflectance function BDRF and Maximum liklihoodestimation MLE. Spectral unmixing algorithms are used to determinethe contribution of multiple substances in a single pixel of ahyperspectral image. For any kind of unmixing model basic approach isto describe how different substances are combined in a compositespectrum. When a linear reationship exists between the fractionalabundance of the substances, linear unmixing algorithms can determinethe endmembers present in that particular pixel. When the relationshipis not linear rather each substance is randomly distributed in ahomogeneous way the mixing is called nonlinear. Though there areplenty of  unmixing algorithms based on linear mixing models LMM butvery few algorithms have developed to to unmix nonlinear data.

Bottone, C. J. Stanek, DataPath, Inc.Probabilistic graphical models, in particular Bayesian networks, providea consistent framework in which to address problems containinguncertainty and complexity.  Probabilistic inference in highdimensionalproblems only becomes tractable when the system can be mademodular by imposing meaningful conditional independenceassumptions.  Bayesian networks provide a natural way to accomplishthis.  As a combination of probability theory and graph theory, theprobabilistic aspects of a graphical model provide a consistent way ofconnecting data to models, while graph theory provides an intuitivelyappealing interface to express independence assumptions as well asefficient computation algorithms.  There are three main problemsassociated with Bayesian networks 1 Inference given a model, tocompute marginal probabilities on unobserved nodes, given evidenceon some subset of other nodes.  2 Learning probabilities given amodel and some data, to estimate the unknown parameters for thelocal conditional probabilities.  3 Learning structure given data, toestimate the unknown structure of the graph as well as the underlyinglocal probabilities.  Various aspects of Bayesian networks will bedemonstrated with examples taken from sensor data fusion andmonitoring and control of satellite network systems.656624, Session 5Target identification using multiradar fusionI. I. Jouny, Lafayette CollegeThe problem of target recognition using signatures collected by a multiradar system is investigated in this paper. A comparison between theperformance of target recognition systems that fuse the observedsignatures with those that fuse the identification decision is established.Multiradar systems interrogating the same target provide multiaspectsignatures that can enhance, when fused properly, the recognitionperformance. This paper proposes a signatures fusion scheme as wellas a decision fusion mechanism. The recognition performanceassuming a target with unknown azimuth is assessed using bothsystems, and a comparison is established. The performance isassessed using real radar signatures recorded in a compact rangesetting. The paper highlights scenarios where a multiradar systemprovides little advantage for target recognition purposes, and when itcan significantly improve the recognition performance.

Wang, Tempest TechnologiesLLCWe present a novel algorithm for tracking with ladar sensors to aid innavigation, guidance and control systems, suitable for applications tounmanned air vehicles.  The methods we employ are based onBayesian segmentation, optical flow, active contour and Bayesianparticle tracking.The algorithm herein holds several significant advantages overtraditional tracking methods.  The first step in the process is the optimalsegmentation of images to enhance the targets and extract them frombackground clutter and noise.  The Bayesian approach to segmentationallows the use of intensity passive and range active imagery to findtargets. Optical flow generalizes and improves correlation techniquesfor locating objects within a frame, allowing for aspect angle and rangechanges.  With optical flow, we may infer relative velocities on a pixelbypixel basis.  Active contours are ideally suited to both targetsparseand targetrich environments.  The energy approach to determiningcontours allows the merging and separating of potential targets in anautomatic manner.  Bayesian particle tracking techniques are used totrack the contours over time.The algorithm is tested successfully on experimental and simulatedladar data using both intensity and range data as well as sequences ofvideo imageries.  The streamedlined processing, from getting theimage data of size 805x148 pixels to detecting the moving target towrapping an active contour on the target, takes less than one secondsclock time and provides very accurate predictions of the target locationin future frames.Conf. 6566 Automatic Target Recognition XVII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 267656626, Session 5An ensemble approach to data fusion and its applicationto ATRC. Barbu, Tulane Univ. J. Peng, Montclair State Univ. S. R. F. Sims,U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Research, Development andEngineering Ctr.Ensemble methods provide a principled framework in which to buildhigh performance classifiers and represent many types of data. As aresult, these methods can be useful for ATR and making inferencesabout potential targets. We introduce an ensemble method forcombining multiple representations or views. The method is a multipleview generalization of AdaBoost. Similar to AdaBoost, weak classifiersare independently built from each represetation view. However, all datatypes share the same sampling distribution computed from the type ofdata having the smallest error rate. As such, the most consistent datatype dominates over time, thereby significantly reducing sensitivity tonoise. The method is applied to the problem of facial and genderprediction based on biometric traits. The new method outperformsseveral competing techniques including kernelbased data fusion, andis provably better than AdaBoost trained on any single type of data.656627, Session 6Sense and avoid technology for unmanned aircraftsystemsJ.

W. Paglieroni, Lawrence Livermore National Lab.A novel technique for corner detection in images that uses an FFTbased algorithm to match corners modeled as gradient direction fieldsto image gradient direction fields is described.  The signal strength of acorner is discussed in terms of the number of pixels along the edges ofa corner in an image, while noise is characterized by variance ingradient directions along those edges.  The detectionfalse alarm ratebehavior of our corner detector is evaluated empirically by manuallyconstructing maps of corner locations in typical overhead images, andthen generating different ROC curves for models of corners withdifferent leg lengths and thicknesses.  We demonstrate how cornersfound with our algorithm can be used to quickly extract prescribedpolygonal shapes of arbitrary position, size and orientation from images.656629, Session 6Multiple target vehicles detection and classificationbased on lowrank decompositionT. Viangteeravat, A. H. Shirkhodaie, H. Rababaah, Tennessee StateUniv.Considerable interest has arisen in the recent years utilizing inexpensiveacoustic sensors in the battlefield to perform targets of interestidentification and classification. There are many advantages of usingacoustic sensor arrays. They are low cost and have relatively low powerconsumption. They require no line of sight and provide manycapabilities for target detection, bearing estimation, target tracking,classification and identification. Furthermore, they can provide cueingfor other sensors and multiple acoustic sensors responses can becombined and triangulated to localize an energy source target in thefield. In practice, however, many environment noise, timevarying, anduncertainties factors affect their performance in detecting targets ofinterest reliably and accurate. In this paper, we have proposed a novelfeature extraction approach for robust classification and identification ofmoving target vehicles to reduce those factors. The approach is basedon Low Rank Decomposition based   norm. Using Low RankDecomposition based   norm, dominant features of vehicle acousticsignatures are extracted efficiently with respect to vehicle operationalresponses. Then, these feature vectors are employed for robustidentification and classification of target vehicles. The performance ofthe proposed approach was evaluated based on a set of experimentalacoustic data from multiple vehicle testruns. It is demonstrated that theapproach yields very promising results to detect, identify and classifytarget vehicles in the field.656631, Session 6Shape prior active contour model based on curvesimilarityP. Cheng, H. Cao, Huazhong Univ. of Science and TechnologyChinaThis paper present a shape prior active contour model designed forextracting irregularshaped object which does not accuratelycorrespond to the shape prior knowledge. Its main idea is to allowshape prior template deforms to a similar shape space, thus can fit thevariance of the object. We propose curve similarity function based onVector Field analysis to judge the likelihood between a contour and ashape space and embed it to our novel energy function, which makesthe contour prone to approach both the boundary and the shape spacebut not rigidly limited to them, makes it balances between flexibility andshapeinvariance. Experimental results show that the model is able tosustain heavy noise, cluttering background and concave boundary,which exceed the original model, and is easier to focus on deformedand distorted object than most contemporary shape prior activecontours.656632, Session 6Toward a sensorbased threat warning system for patrolsin MOUT scenariosJ. Metzler, D. N. Willersinn, Fraunhofer Institute for Information andDataprocessing GermanyMilitary operations in urban terrain require the capability to perceive andto analyse the situation around a patrol in order to recognize potentialthreats. Human operators can only observe a limited field of regard.Sensors can enhance the field of regard up to 360, but then theamount of data cannot be fully exploited by a human operator anymore. For this reason an intelligent assistance system is required thatmonitors the circumference of a moving platform and warns the driverof a threatening situation. One first processing step of such a system isthe recognition of humans and their behavior from a sequence of videoimages. There are numerous approaches to the analysis of humanaction, mainly from stationary cameras. Moving cameras play a role inthe field of pedestrian protection from a moving road vehicle. There aretwo principal differences to this latter application domain. Firstly, theConf. 6566 Automatic Target Recognition XVII268 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssthreat in a MOUT scenario potentially stems from humans in the scene.Secondly, not only the trajectories of individual pedestrians are relevant,but also the motion and the behavior of groups of pedestrians. As a firststep towards an assistance system that automatically warns drivers in aMOUT scenario, we implemented approaches to the detection ofhumans in video images and applied them to a relevant set of imagessequences taken in a MOUT scenario. In the paper we assess theobtained results and outline further research activities.656648, Session 6Point target detection using superresolutionreconstructionJ. Dijk, K. Schutte, D. J. de Lange, TNOFEL NetherlandsSurveillance applications are primarily concerned with detection oftargets. In electrooptical surveillance systems, missiles or otherweapons coming towards you are observed as moving points. Typically,such moving targets need to be detected in a very short time. One ofthe problems is that the targets will have a low signaltonoise ratio withrespect to the background, and that the background can be severelycluttered like in an airtoground scenario.The first step in detection of point targets is to suppress thebackground. The novelty of this work is that a superresolutionreconstruction algorithm is used in the background suppression step. Itis wellknown that super resolution reconstruction reduces the aliasingin the image. This antialiasing is used to model the specific aliasingcontribution in the camera image, which results in a better estimate ofthe clutter in the background. Using superresolution reconstructionalso reduces the temporal noise, thus providing a better signaltonoiseratio than the camera images. After the background suppression stepcommon detection algorithms such as thresholding or trackbeforedetect can be used.Experimental results will be given which show that the use of superresolution significantly increases the sensitivity of the point targetdetection.656633, Session 7Vehicle ATR with separable correlation filters cued bypose estimatesF. E. McFadden, General Dynamics Advanced Information SystemsSynthetic discriminant functions SDFs were developed to recognizetargets subject to moderate pose variations, but control of false alarmshas been problematic. This work uses a precise pose estimator in orderto narrow the range of poses that must be handled by the SDF, andthus to improve false alarm rates. It is also shown that acceptableclassification performance can be achieved when the precise poseestimator is followed by a separable version of the MACH filter.  In thisway more posespecific filters can be used while conserving memoryrequirements. The pose estimation algorithm is relatively robust to scalevariations, and significantly more precise than previously publishedresults.  The twostep ATR system is demonstrated for MSTAR data,and recommendations are made for the number of components thatcan be used in a separable version of the MACH filters, withoutsignificant loss of performance.656634, Session 7An efficient quadratic correlation filter for automatictarget recognitionW. Mikhael, P. Ragothaman, Univ. of Central Florida R. R. Muise, A.Mahalanobis, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire ControlQuadratic Correlation Filters have recently been used for AutomaticTarget Recognition ATR. Among these, the Rayleigh QuotientQuadratic Correlation Filter RQQCF was found to give excellentperformance when tested extensively with Infrared imagery. In theRQQCF method, the filter coefficients are obtained, from a set oftraining images, such that the response to the filter is large when theinput is a target and small when the input is clutter. The methodexplicitly maximizes a class separation metric to obtain optimalperformance. In this paper, a novel transform domain approach ispresented for ATR using the RQQCF. The proposed approach, calledthe Transform Domain RQQCF TDRQQCF has several advantages. Itconsiderably reduces the computational complexity and storagerequirements, by compressing the target and clutter data used indesigning the QCF. Since the dimensionality of the data points isreduced, this method also overcomes the common problem of dealingwith low rank matrices arising from the lack of large training sets inpractice. Finally, this approach also leads to improved recognitionperformance over the original algorithm. The proposed method is testedusing IR imagery, and sample results are presented which confirm itsexcellent properties.656635, Session 7Data driven training image set selection for compositecorrelation filter banksD. W. Carlson, A. Ramirez, Raytheon Missile SystemsComposite correlation filters have been demonstrated in manyautomatic target recognition ATR applications because of their abilityfor class discrimination and distortiontolerance with shift invariance. Bycombining a subset of the training images into each filter, the filter bankcan recognize a target class across distortions such as target aspectazimuth. However, the selection of training images for each filter in thebank is usually a simple approach resulting in variable performanceacross filters. We investigate different methods of datadriven groupingof target variation which allows for unique combinations of trainingimages into a filter. We introduce a new use of Isometric MappingISOMAP manifold extraction and spanning trees to group the trainingimages for use in composite correlation filter approaches to ATR.ISOMAP is a nonlinear method that reduces the high dimensionality ofdata such as images. Other methods of selecting the training setswithin a filter bank including equallyspaced assignment and kmeansclustering are compared in their impact on target classification. Testresults using the publicly released MSTAR database are shown.656636, Session 7Efficient directional filter bank structures for imagedecompositionR. Ansari, Univ. of IllinoisChicago D. Fennell, ITT Space SystemsLLC A. M. Bagci, Univ. of IllinoisChicago B. J. Chambers, W.Reynolds, Jr., ITT Visual Information SolutionsIn an effort to discover and extract highly directional cues in airbornesurveillance images, we have developed efficient filtering methods fordirectional decomposition of images to aid in target detection. Sinceimages of interest are very large and the filtered images are notdownsampled in the application of interest, conventional filtering can becomputationally extremely demanding and there is a need to explorealternative procedures to make the filtering efficient. In this paper anovel filter bank structure for directional filtering of images is proposedand its design described. The design is carried out by imposingstructural constraints on the filters, which are implemented using ageneralized notion of separable filtering. The structure uses onedimensional 1D filters as building blocks, which are employed in novelconfigurations to obtain filters with narrow wedgeshaped passbands.In the implementation, 1D filtering is performed along directionsdetermined by the passband orientations of the directional filters. Ifdownsampling is desired then the treestructured decomposition lendsitself to a liftingbased implementation. The structures exploit polyphaserepresentations of 1D and 2D filters in combination with horizontal andvertical upsampling and downsampling to obtain wedgeshapedpassband support. The filters are applicable in pyramidaldecompositions and liftingbased wavelet decompositions.  Designprocedures have been developed for constructing 16band, 32band,and 64band partitions starting with either builtin or userspecified 1Dprototypes. Filters generated by the proposed method have beenapplied to airborne surveillance images. Implementations of filters usingthe proposed method show significant improvement compared withconventional implementation, often more by an order of magnitude,which is also supported by a theoretical analysis of the filter complexity.Conf. 6566 Automatic Target Recognition XVII spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 269656637, Session 7Autonomous spacecraft docking using opticalcorrelation techniquesG.

The SLMsprovide rapid optical correlations obtainable at up to 4 KHz.  The 3Danimation software enables the rapid rendering of the 2D filter imagesof the modeled target craft for the neural network training sets.

The performance of the opticalcorrelator for a docking application as well as an analysis of theidentification methods chosen will be discussed.656638, Session 8A novel ROC approach for performance evaluation oftarget detection algorithmsP. Ganapathy, J. A. Skipper, Wright State Univ.Receiver operator characteristic ROC analysis is an emergingautomated target recognition system performance assessment tool. TheROC metric, area under the curve AUC, is a universally acceptedmeasure of classifying accuracy. The detection algorithm output, i.e., aresponse plane RP, must consist of grayscale values wherein amaximum value e.g. 255 corresponds to highest probability of targetlocations. AUC computation involves the comparison of the RP andground truth to classify RP pixels as either true negatives TN, falsepositives FP, true positives TP or false negatives FN. Ideally, thebackground and all objects other than targets are TN. Historically,evaluation methods have excluded the background, and only a fewspoof objects likely to be considered as a hit by detection algorithmswere a priori demarcated as TN. This can potentially exaggerate thealgorithms performance. Here, a new ROC approach has beendeveloped that divides the entire image into mutually exclusive targetTP and background TN grid squares with adjustable size. Based onthe overlap of the thresholded RP with the TP and TN grids, the FN andFP fractions are computed. Variation of the grid size can bias the ROCresults by artificially altering specificity, so assessment of relativeperformance under a constant grid size is adopted in our approach.  Apilot study was performed to assess the methods ability to capture RPchanges under three different detection algorithm parameter settings onten images with different backgrounds and target orientations.  AnANOVAbased comparison of the AUCs for the three settings showed asignificant difference p0.001 at 95 confidence interval.656639, Session 8Evaluation testbed for ATD performance predictionETAPPS. K.

Accurate prediction of ATDperformance would assist in system design and trade studies,collection management, and mission planning. A need exists for ATDperformance prediction based exclusively on information available fromthe imagery and its associated metadata.  The modeling effort consistsof two phases a learning phase, where image measures are computedfor a set of test images, the ATD performance is measured, and aprediction model is developed and a second phase to test and validateperformance prediction. The learning phase produces a mapping, validacross various ATR algorithms, which is even applicable when no imagetruth is available e.g., when evaluating denied area imagery. Ongoingefforts to develop such a prediction model have met with somesuccess. In particular, we have extended previous modeling work tocharacterize the relationship between the current image set and thetraining imagery used to develop the ATD.  Inclusion of this informationsignificantly improves prediction performance. The image measuresemployed in the model include statistics derived from a constant falsealarm rate CFAR processor, the Power Spectrum Signature, andothers.

C. Gross, Air Force Institute of Technology J. A. Wayman II, TheOhio State Univ. G. P. Perram, Air Force Institute of TechnologyMany aspects of detonation phenomena have been well studied overthe last century. However, the transient infrared and visible emissionsfrom detonation fireballs have been poorly understood and hamperedthe robust identification of explosives via remote sensing techniques.Recently, timeresolved infrared spectra 18007000cm, 416cmresolution, 820 Hz of various highexplosive HE detonation fireballshave been collected during several field experiments. The observedspectra are driven by many factors including the explosives chemistryand weight, the method of detonation, interactions with theenvironment, and the casing used to enclose the explosive. Fireballsfrom conventional munitions, which are comprised of HEs such as TNTor HMX and encased in an iron shell, are optically thick and welldescribed as a greybody with a temperature that decays from 1800 Kto ambient within 35 s. A small amount of selective emission is alsopresent and attributable to hot CO2.Detonation of uncased, raw charges of TNT and three types ofenhanced novel explosives ENEs of various weights 10, 50, 100, and1000 kg produce fireballs with more interesting spectral characteristics.A simple model for fireball emissions has been developed whichaccurately describes the observed spectra in terms of the fireballradius, temperature, water and carbon dioxide concentrations, and greyparticulate absorption coefficient. The model affords highfidelitydimensionality reduction and provides physical features which can beused to distinguish the uncased explosives. For example, the observedH2OCO2 concentration ratio is sensitive to the relative amounts ofhydrogen and carbon in the HE. With absolutely calibrated spectra, thetotal number of observed water and carbon dioxide molecules can beused to infer the weight of the explosive material.Conf. 6566 Automatic Target Recognition XVII270 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656642, Session 8Evaluation of object level change detection techniquesJ.

Careful planning, soundexperimental design, and access to suitable imagery with image truthand metadata are critical.656643, Session 8Construction and correction of probability densitiesL. Cohen, Hunter CollegeCUNYOf fundamental importance in automatic target recognition is theestablishment of probability densities for decision making. Theconstruction and correction of probability densities is an old subjectand numerous methods have been developed over the years. Twoclassical results of Edgeworth and GramCharlier series wherecorrections are be made to Gaussian distribuions. We have devised ageneralization of the GramCharlier and Edgeworth series which makesthese methods much more flexible. Our generalization is two fold. Firstone does not only transform from Gaussian distribution but one cantransform from an arbitrary distribution and secondly an arbitraryHermitian operator may be used rather then just the differential operatorof the standard methods. This opens up possibilities for new and moreeffective methods for  construction of probability densities that fits agiven set of data. A number of concrete examples will be given to showthat the generalization works much better then the standard methods.656644, Session 9Human motion tracking using mean shift clustering anddiscrete cosine transformM. F. Islam, M. S. Alam, Univ. of South AlabamaHuman motion tracking is an active area of research in computer visionand machine intelligence. Several motion tracking algorithms have beenproposed for applications to video surveillance and humancomputerinterface systems. However, most of the techniques can only trackmore than one person in a given image. This paper proposes a noveldetection algorithm for tracking a specific person from a crowdedenvironment. Here mean shift clustering procedure is employed in thedifference image to obtain the candidate cluster, which convergeswithin little iteration. The number of clusters and cluster centers areautomatically derived by mode seeking with mean shift procedure.Discrete cosine transform is then applied to each cluster and also to theknown target for extracting the features of the cluster and the target.Finally, the Mahalanobis distance is measured between eachtransformed candidate cluster and the target. The cluster with theminimum distance is then considered as the desired target. Tracking iscarried out by updating the cluster parameters over time using themean shift procedure. Computer simulation is carried out with real lifeimages where an excellent tracking performance is observed.656645, Session 9Visionbased vehicle tracking using image alignmentwith symmetrical functionL. Cheung, Y. Moon, The Chinese Univ. of Hong Kong Hong KongChinaThe large number of rear end collisions due to driver inattention hasbeen identified as a major automotive safety issue. Even a shortadvance warning can significantly reduce the number and severity ofthe collisions. In this paper, we describe an image alignment basedvehicle detection methodology with a single camera as input for use indetecting vehicles approaching the blind spot of a car on highways andcity streets with relative distance and time to contact information.We have developed a methodology optimized for detecting vehicles inthe blind spot of an intelligent vehicle. Generally, the blind spotbecomes only viewable when the driver turns his head. Unfortunately, alot of drivers are often lazy to turn their heads when driving. If a realtime rear vehicle detection system can give an advance warning to adriver when the relative distance or the contact time between a rearvehicle and the camera on the drivers car is too small, significantnumber of automobile collisions can be greatly prevented.Our very first task is to identify the rear vehicles. Many active methodsof obstacle detection such as laser and radar cannot be possible in thehighway due to interference among vehicles. Therefore, it is worthwhileto investigate completely passive approaches, such as vision, forvehicle detection. With the aid of symmetrical function, the region ofinterest in the image can be greatly reduced. It makes the methodologybecomes relatively simple to implement using embedded systemtechnology in the automobile environment.656646, Session 9Facial feature tracking with the super image vector innerproductL. G. Hassebrook, W. Su, B. Hao, D. L. Lau, Univ. of KentuckyWe demonstrate a new and efficient distortioninvariant super imagevector inner product tracker and pose estimator based on linear phasecoefficient composite filter. The super image consists of a weightedsum of training images. These images span the distortion ranges ofrotation, scale, and translation. The superimage vector inner product ismathematically related to composite filter design but, unlike correlationfilters, the super image is implemented using a complex vector innerproduct operation. A super image vector inner product is implementedby elementwise multiplying a super image template by a window ofinterest in the input scene and then summing the elementwiseoperations. The resulting amplitude indicates target detection and theresulting phase indicates the value of scale, orientation or movement ofthe target object.  The design and implementation of the super imagevector inner product are presented and its applications to whole faceand facial feature biometric tracking, such as earlobes, eyes with noseand lower jaw are demonstrated.656647, Session 9Rapid automatic target recognition using generic 3Dsensor and shapefrommotion dataC.

One of the factorslimiting the implementation of these approaches is lag in operationalhardware to provide the type of data required.Neptec has addressed this sensor concern in its 3D ATR software.  Thepreviously reported ATR software has been expanded from proofofconcept groundtoground to include airtoground capabilities.  Thesystem uses a generic 3D model of the target, such as from CAD orscanned from a scale or full sized model which does not need to be aperfect representation.

The need for specific operational 3Dsensing hardware is avoided by using a generic range image format.This capability has been demonstrated using groundbased imaginglidar, airborne pushbroom lidar, scannerless AMcw lidar, and shapefrommotion using a 2D camera.  Multiple data sets can also be fusedto optimize confidence in the recognition and provide measures ofsimilarity between different targets and the data set.This paper presents an overview of the 3D ATR approach and updatesperformance characteristics from a variety of tests that includesynthetic data, lab tests, and field tests.  It is shown that the approachis fast, highly robust, flexible, and is primarily limited by the quality ofsensor data.

C. Stubberud, Anzus, Inc. K. A. Kramer, Univ. of San DiegoThe neural extended Kalman filter is an adaptive estimation techniquethat has been shown to learn online the maneuver model of a targetstrajectory.  This improved motion model can be used to better predictthe location of a target at given point in time especially when the targethas limited maneuvering capabilities such as mortar shell.  In this paper,the neural extended Kalman filter is used to predict impact point andimpact time of a ballisticlike projectile when the drag on the shell wasnot accurately modeled in the motion model using measurement reportsprovided by multiple sensor systems.  In previous work, the neuralextended Kalman filter was shown to work well with a single sensorwith a uniform sample rate.  Multiple sensors incorporate two majormodifications into the complexity of the problem.  The first is to handlea nonuniform update rate of the measurements to the tracking system.While most tracking systems can easily handle this difference, theadaptation of the parameters can be deleteriously affected by suchvariations.  The second modification is that related to the multipleaspect angles and related uncertainty that affects the model adaptation.The changing data accuracies and sensor models can cause transientinstabilities in the feedback adaptation unless properly compensated.In this effort, performance of the neural extended Kalman filter as anadaptive and predictive scheme, with the modifications inimplementation, is shown to provide a quality impact estimate.656702, Session 1Markov chains for the prediction of trackingperformanceP. O. Arambel, M. Antone, BAE Systems Advanced InformationTechnologiesHighly accurate predictions of tracking performance usually require highfidelity Monte Carlo simulations that entail significant implementationtime, run time, and complexity.  In this paper we consider the use ofMarkov Chains as a simpler alternative that models critical aspects ofthe tracking process and provides reasonable estimates of trackingperformance, while maintaining much lower cost and complexity. Wedescribe a general procedure for MarkovChain based performanceprediction, and illustrate the use of this procedure in the context of anairborne system that uses a steerable EOIR sensor to track multipletargets in nonoverlapping fields of view. We discuss the effects of keymodel parameters, including measurement sampling rates, tracktermination, target occlusions, and missed detections. We also presentplots of performance as a function of occlusion length, targetmaneuverability, confuser density, and sensor slew rate, as well asplatform and target geometries.656703, Session 1Two solutions to the localization using time difference ofarrival problemT. Sathyan, T. Kirubarajan, McMaster Univ. CanadaIn this paper, two solutions to the problem of emitter localization usingtime difference of arrival TDOA measurements are proposed. Themaximum likelihood estimation for this problem will result in a nonlinear,nonconvex optimization, and hence is very difficult to solve. Thesolutions presented in this paper consider an alternate formulation,which is based on the sensortarget geometry. Even this formulationresults in nonconvex however, linear optimization problem. The firstsolution presented relaxes the original optimization problem into a semidefinite program SDP. Using the solution to this relaxed SDP, emitter islocalized using a randomization technique. The second solution formsthe Lagrangian dual of the original problem, and it is shown that thedual is a SDP. From the solution to the dual problem a solution to theoriginal problem is found. It has to be noted that this solution to theoriginal problem will be optimal if strong duality holds. This is currentlybeing analyzed. Initial simulation results, however, suggest that boththese solution techniques gives localization accuracies that are betterthan the other techniques found in literature.656704, Session 1Acoustic signature analysis and data fusion of vehiclesbased on acoustic sensor arraysT. Viangteeravat, A. H. Shirkhodaie, H. Rababaah, Tennessee StateUniv.Considerable interest has arisen in the recent years utilizing inexpensiveacoustic sensors in the battlefield to perform targets of interestidentification and classification. There are many advantages of usingacoustic sensor arrays. They are low cost, and relatively have lowpower consumption. They require no line of sight and provide manycapabilities for target detection, bearing estimation, target tracking,classification and identification. Furthermore, they can provide cueingfor other sensors and multiple acoustic sensors responses can becombined and triangulated to localize an energy source target in thefield. In practice, however, many environment noise factors affects theirperformance in detecting targets of interest reliably and accurate. In thispaper, we have proposed a novel approach for detection, classification,and identification of moving target vehicles. The approach is based onSingular Value Decomposition SVD coupled with Particle Filtering PFtechnique.  Using SVD dominant features of  vehicle acoustic signaturesare extracted efficiently. Then, these feature vectors are employed forrobust identification and classification of target vehicles based on aparticle filtering scheme. The performance of the proposed approachwas evaluated based on a set of experimental acoustic data frommultiple vehicle testruns. It is demonstrated that the approach yieldsvery promising results where an array of acoustic sensors are used todetect, identify and classify target vehicles in the field.656705, Session 1Structural and metric correlation of electrooptical andradar generated tracksB. Kovalerchuk, Central Washington Univ.Integration of electrooptical and radar generated tracks is critical forproviding a single integrated picture SIP of the dynamic situation. Thispaper proposes a new, robust, realtime algorithm to i correctlycorrelate data from several sensors and the existing system track, andii identify when the data represent new tracks. The proposed algorithmuses metric data, linear, and area features extracted from optical andradar images. The major novelty of the algorithm is in use of robust andaffine invariant structural relations built on the features for accuratecorrelation. A constructed measure of confidence with the correlationdecision is based on both structural and metric similarities of tracks toestimate both bias and random errors. The similarities are based onconcepts from the abstract algebraic systems, generalized GaussMarkov stochastic processes, and Kalman filters for ndimensional timeseries that explicitly model measurement dependence on k previousmeasurements, Mtt1,t2,...,tk. The algorithm identifies groups oftracks that form a cluster using this measure of confidence. Thesetechniques are combined with the hierarchical matching approach toincrease the overall track accuracy. Only tracks that are notdistinguished in every hierarchical level are clustered into a single track.The proposed search algorithm for track correlationmatching is suitablefor both centralized and distributed computing architecture. spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 273656706, Session 1Tracking partially occluded objects in moving cameras byextended recursive leastsquares filtering with forgettingfactorC. Li, B. Li, J. Si, Arizona State Univ. G. P. Abousleman, GeneralDynamics C4 SystemsMany applications require tracking of moving objects within a movingbackground that is caused by camera motion. One example arises fromairborne video. The task becomes even more challenging when takinginto account additional compounding factors such as noise, modeldeformation, and occlusion. We propose a new tracking system toaddress target tracking in moving backgrounds when the target ispartially occluded. The proposed algorithm comprises three steps  Fastgeometric constraint global motion FGCGM estimation, extendedrecursive leastsquares filter ERLSF with forgetting factor, and directionguided DG search. The FGCGM estimation obtains a more accurateaffine model by reducing the error from moving targets. The objectposition and velocity are formulated by dynamic state and observationequations based on the affine model and the position estimation from theDG search. The ERLSF with forgetting factor can then be used to updatethe position and the velocity estimation simultaneously. The DG searchuses the predicted position and velocity from the filter to construct acompact search region for the next frame. The search result is thenprovided to the filter as an observation. The filter is a key step to provideaccurate velocity estimation in the presence of disturbances. Theadaptive template maintains the consistency between the template andthe current targets appearance. The DG search reduces the probabilityof mismatching between target templates and candidates.  Theproposed recursive algorithm can track objects in video sequencesprecisely and in real time, even if some of the frames are corrupted bynoise, andor the targets are partially or fully occluded in some frames.656707, Session 2Fuzzy decision trees for planning and autonomous controlof a coordinated team of UAVsJ. F. Smith III, Naval Research Lab.A fuzzy logic resource manager that enables a collection of unmannedaerial vehicles UAVs to automatically cooperate to make meteorologicalmeasurements will be discussed.  Once in flight no human intervention isrequired.  Planning and realtime control algorithms determine theoptimal trajectory and points each UAV will sample, while taking intoaccount the UAVs risk, risk tolerance, reliability, mission priority, fuellimitations, mission cost, and related uncertainties.  The control algorithmpermits newly obtained information about weather and other events tobe introduced to allow the UAVs to be more effective.  The approach isillustrated by a discussion of the fuzzy decision tree for UAV pathassignment and related simulation.  The different fuzzy membershipfunctions on the tree are described in mathematical detail.  The threedifferent methods by which this tree is obtained are summarizedincluding a method based on using a genetic program as a data miningfunction.  A second fuzzy decision tree that allows the UAVs toautomatically collaborate without human intervention is discussed.  Thistree permits three different types of collaborative behavior between theUAVs.  A genetic program based method for obtaining this tree is alsosummarized.  The trees relationship to an older fuzzy sum rule isdiscussed.  Simulations illustrating how the tree allows the different typesof collaboration to be automated are provided.  Simulations also showthe ability of the control algorithm to allow UAVs to effectively cooperateto increase the UAV teams likelihood of success.656708, Session 2Random set tracking and entropy based control appliedto distributed sensor networksD. W. J. Stein, J. Witkoskie, S. Theophanis, W. S. Kuklinski, TheMITRE Corp.This paper describes random set based sensor fusion algorithms, andcompanion sensornetwork control algorithms. The sensornetworkcontrol algorithms specify sensor actions designed to minimize theexpected entropy of the variable length multipletarget statevectorGlobal Density, subject to operational constraints.  Our random setapproach to target tracking avoids association ambiguity by statisticallyweighing all possible hypotheses and associations. Additionally, to limitcomputational complexity, our method involves the reparameterizationof the posterior Global Density using a Gaussian mixture approximation,as required.  Specific traditional approaches to multiple target tracking,such as Multiple Hypothesis Trackers MHT and Joint IntegratedProbabilistic Data Association JIPDA trackers are shown to be specialcases of our Random Set Tracker RST.  The computational complexityof the RST is minimized using information theoretic criteria that avoidmany of the limiting assumptions inherent in the MHT and JIPDA.  Aresource management algorithm based on minimizing the expectedentropy of the Global Density defined on the multipletarget statespaceis described in detail. The entropy minimization is performed, subject tooperational constraints on energy expenditure associated with sensoroperation, computation or internode communications. The RST, MHTand JIPDA are applied to a multipletarget roadconstrained trackingproblem to allow comparison of their performance. Field data from asensor network comprised of multiple range radars, and acousticarrays, that measure angle of arrival, are used for this comparison. Theentropy based resource manager is also applied to this trackingproblem, and, for various scenarios, the relationship between energyexpenditure and uncertainty in target statevector estimates, asmeasured by entropy, is also provided.656709, Session 2Adaptive sensor tasking using genetic algorithmsP. J. Shea, J. Kirk, D. Welchons, Black River Systems Co.Todays battlefield environment contains a large number of sensors, andsensor types, onboard multiple platforms. The set of sensor typesincludes SAR, EOIR, GMTI, AMTI, HSI, MSI, and video, and for eachsensor type there may be multiple sensing modalities to select from. Inan attempt to maximize sensor performance, todays sensors employeither static tasking approaches or require an operator to manuallychange sensor tasking operations. In a highly dynamic environment thisleads to a situation whereby the sensors become less effective as thesensing environments deviates from the assumed conditions.Through a Phase I SBIR effort we developed a system architecture anda common tasking approach for solving the sensor tasking problem asapplied to a radar and EOIR sensor mix. Our sensor tasking considersmultiple layers within the task hierarchy ranging from the mission level,where tasking focuses on mission requirements, down to where sensortasking focuses on radar submode and waveform selection. We alsodeveloped a genetic algorithm based task scheduling approach anddemonstrated the ability to automatically task and schedule sensors inan endtoend closed loop simulation. In the proof of concept wedemonstrated the ability to schedule multiple radar sensorssimultaneously. This provides a solid foundation for our future effortsincluding incorporation of EOIR and other sensor types. As we havemoved forward into the second phase of this effort, we are increasingthe fidelity of the simulation and tasking approach by considering otherfactors such as environmental constraints and other sensor limitations.This paper will describe our approach for scheduling using geneticalgorithms as well as our concept for a multilayer architecture. We willalso describe our endtoend closed loop software simulationenvironment. We will conclude with a discussion of results for a sampleproblem and of the path forward.656710, Session 2Distributed sensor resource management and planningD. Khosla, J. Guillochon, HRL Labs., LLCThe goal of sensor resource management SRM is to allocate resourcesappropriately in order to gain as much information as possible about asystem. In our previous paper, we introduced a centralized nonmyopicplanning algorithm called Centralized Sparse Planning CSPLAN thatuses sparse sampling to estimate the value of resource assignments. Inthis paper we extend our approach to a distributed framework andConf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI274 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsspresent the Distributed Sparse Planning DSPLAN algorithm. Sparsesampling is related to Monte Carlo simulation. In the SRM problem weconsider, our network of sensors observes a set of tracks each sensorcan be set to operate in one of several modes andor viewinggeometries. Each mode incurs a different cost and provides differentinformation about the tracks. Each track has a kinematic state and is ofa certain class the sensors can observe either or both of these,depending on their mode of operation. The goal is to maximize theoverall rate of information gain, i.e. rate of improvement in kinematictracking and classification accuracy of all tracks in the Area of Interest.We compare and test the algorithm performance on several trackingand target identification problems to that of other algorithms. Wecompare the performance as well as computational andcommunications costs of CSPLAN and DSPLAN as well as neartermplanners.656711, Session 2Integrated tracking and sensor management based onexpected information gainK. A. B. White, Defence Science and Technology OrganisationAustraliaThe availability of flexible sensors offers new opportunities for enhancedtracking performance. Management of such sensors must considertheir characteristics and the tracking situation picture. Shannonsinformation measure provides a means of quantifying the potential gainsfrom various sensor deployment options.The problem of tracking targets with an electronically scanned arrayradar is addressed. The radar can be commanded to conductsurveillance of the search volume in a manner that is analogous tomechanically scanned radar. In conjunction with the surveillance mode,a revisit mode permits the radar to be commanded to form beams toilluminate a specific volume, such as in the vicinity of a track. Anexpected information gain is computed which is a function of theprobability of detecting the tracked target with the revisit beam. It isalso a function of the predicted track uncertainty in the event that thetarget was not detected, and of the expected fused track uncertainty ifthe target is detected. A high value for the expected information gainoccurs when a measurement is likely to yield a significant improvementin the track uncertainty and there is a sufficiently high probability ofdetecting the target being tracked. Results from implementing theexpected information gain in an integrated tracking and radarmanagement system are presented and discussed.656712, Session 2Distributed simulation of an informationbased sensormanagement systemJ. P. Malachowski, K. J. Hintz, George Mason Univ.A sensor, like any other tool, is wasted in the hands of the ignorant. Itfalls to the responsibility of the sensor manager to utilize the sensor asintelligently as possible.The nonlinear operation and nonstationary stochastic environment ofsensor managers requires the use of simulation techniques to verifytheir behavior. This is particularly evident when comparing theeffectiveness of different approaches to sensor management. It isimportant to consider which possible performance metrics are ofinterest and are useful to the evaluation and comparison of competingdesigns.The simulated environment, sensors, tracking, and fusion simulationmust be generic enough to provide an even playing field for comparingdifferent approaches to sensor management while still having enoughfidelity to be useful and conclusive.This paper talks about the evaluation of an informationbased sensormanagement system. The problems and solutions to the need for a toplevel design, accurate and realistic data, computational complexity,required storage, and intermodular communications are alsodiscussed. Much of the simulation has been written in Matlab underLinux though the design ideas do not necessarily preclude otherenvironments.The paper concludes with a preliminary comparison of the performanceof a conventional rulebased sensor management system to aninformationbased sensor management system.656713, Session 3UAVbased distributed ATR under realistic simulatedenvironmental effectsX. Chen, N. A. Schmid, S. Gong, M. Valenti, West Virginia Univ.Over the past several years, the military has grown increasingly reliantupon the use of unattended aerial vehicles UAVs for surveillancemissions.  There is an increasing trend towards fielding larger and largerswarms of UAVs operating as largescale sensor networks in the air 1.Such systems tend to be used primarily for the purpose of automatictarget recognition ATR, the computer processing of image dataobtained by one or more sensors with the goal of acquiring, identifying,and tracking objects of interest.  These trends have been paralleled byadvances in both distributed detection 2, imagesignal processing anddata fusion techniques. Furthermore, swarmed UAV systems mustoperate under severe constraints on environmental conditions andsensor limitations.In this work, we investigate the effects of environmental conditions ontarget detection and recognition performance in a UAV network.  Weassume that each UAV is equipped with an optical camera, and use arealistic computer simulation to generate synthetic images.  Thedetection algorithm relies on Haarbased features while the ATRalgorithm relies on KBessel and Principal Component Analysisfeatures.  The performance of both algorithms is evaluated usingsimulated images that closely mimic data acquired in a UAV networkunder realistic environmental conditions.  We design a modelbasedfusion technique using principles of classical and modern detectiontheory and analyze both the case of a single observation and the caseof multiple observations of the same target.References1 D.M Hart and P.A.

Yue, P. N. Topiwala, FastVDO LLCReal time object detection is a challenging computer vision problem,especially in uncontrolled environments. Unlike traditional classificationproblems, where the statistical models can be properly described bythe training data, it is much harder to discriminate certain object classfrom rest of the world with limited negative training samples. Due to thelarge variation of negatives, sometimes the intraobject class differencemay be even larger than the difference between objects and nonobjects. Besides this, there are many other problems that obstructobject detection, such as pose variation, illuminance variation andpartial occlusion.Previous studies also demonstrated that infrared IR imagery provides apromising alternative to visible imagery. Detectors using IR imagery arerobust to illumination variations and able to detect object under alllighting conditions including total darkness, while detectors based onvisible imagery generally fail in these situations. However, IR imageryhas several drawbacks 1 It is sensitive to temperature changes in thesurrounding environment, which means IR images should be capturedin a controlled environment. 2 It is sensitive to variation in the heatpatterns of the object. For example, vehicles display different heatpatterns with the engine onoff. 3 IR is opaque to glass.In contrast to IR imagery, visible imagery is more robust to the abovefactors. This suggests a better detection system by fusing theinformation from both visible and IR imagery.Moreover, the object detector needs exhaustive search in both spatialConf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 275and scale domain, which inevitably lead to high computation load.In this paper, we propose to use boosting based vehicle detection inboth infrared and visible imagery. Proper decision level fusion method isintroduced for better performance. Experiments are carried out usingATR helmet device with both EO and IR sensors.656715, Session 3Information theoretic partitioning and confidencebasedweight assignment for multiclassifier decision levelfusion in hyperspectral target recognition applicationsS. Prasad, L. M. Bruce, Mississippi State Univ.There is a growing interest in using multiple sources for automatic targetrecognition ATR applications. The key idea behind such an approach isto take multiple, independent observations of a phenomenon andperform a feature level or a decision level fusion for ATR. This paperproposes a method to utilize these types of multisource fusiontechniques to exploit hyperspectral data when only a small number oftraining pixels are available. Conventional hyperspectral image basedATR techniques project the high dimensional reflectance signature ontoa lower dimensional subspace using techniques such as Fishers lineardiscriminant analysis LDA, subspace LDA and stepwise LDA. Whilesome of these techniques attempt to solve the curse of dimensionality,or small sample size problem, these are not necessarily optimalprojections. In this paper, we present a divideandconquer approach toaddress the small sample size problem. The hyperspectral space ispartitioned into contiguous subspaces such that the discriminativeinformation within each subspace is maximized, and the statisticaldependence between subspaces is minimized. We then treat eachsubspace as a separate source in a multisource multiclassifier setupand test various decision fusion schemes to determine their efficacy.Unlike previous approaches which use correlation between variables forbandgrouping, we study the efficacy of higher order statisticalinformation using average mutual information for a bottomup bandgrouping. We also propose a confidencemeasure based decisionfusion technique, where the weights associated with various classifiersare based on the confidence levels learned from the training data. Theproposed methods are tested using hyperspectral data with knownground truth, such that the efficacy can be quantitatively measured interms of target detection accuracies and false alarm rates.656716, Session 3Applying target shadow models for SAR ATRS. Papson, R. M. Narayanan, The Pennsylvania State Univ.Recent work has suggested that target shadows in SAR images can beused effectively to aid in target classification.  The proposed methodhas four steps  segmentation, representation, modeling, and selection.Segmentation is performed via smoothing operations and theestimation of Gaussian mixture model parameters.  A chain codetechnique is used to represent the shadow boundary hidden Markovmodeling is applied to the chain codes to create a suitable bank oftarget representations.  Finally, an ensemble framework is proposed forclassification.  The proposed selection process searches for an optimalensemble of models based on various configurations of the targetclassification problem.  This framework is one method in which theshadow classification technique can be integrated with more classicaltarget recognition algorithms.  A subset of the MSTAR database is usedfor testing.  Performance is investigated as a function of aspect angle.Since the shadow is a backprojection of the target profile, some aspectangles will contain more discriminatory information then others.Additionally, the case of multiple target looks is considered.  Theperformance is reported not only as a function of the number of images,but also as a function of the configuration.

Gurbuz, Georgia Institute of Technology W. L. Melvin, GeorgiaTech Research Institute D. B. Williams, Georgia Institute ofTechnologyRadar offers unique advantages over other sensors, such as visual orseismic sensors, for human target detection.  In many situations,especially military applications, it may not be possible to place a videocamera or implant seismic sensors in the area being observed due tosecurity or other threats.  However, radar can operate as far away frompotential targets, and funtions during daytime as well as nighttim, invirtually all weather conditions.  In this paper, we examine the problemof human target detection and identification using radar.  The impact ofstationary clutter on detection performance is considered.  Humantargets are discriminated by analyzing the spectrogram of eachpotential target.  It is shown that the spectrogram of every human returnis unique, and can be used not just to identify targets as human, butalso to determine features about the human target being observed,such as size, gender, action, and speed.  A 12point human model,toegether with kinematic equations of motion for each body part, isused to calculate the expected target return and spectrogram.  AMATLAB simulation environment is developed, including ground clutter,human and nonhuman targets, for testing proposed detection andidentification algorithms.  Simulations show human targets can besuccessfully discriminated from other targets, and a classificationscheme is developed to extract features about the target beingobserved.656718, Session 4Improving throughput for temporal target nominationusing existing infrastructureP. G. Raeth, Ball Aerospace  Technologies Corp.Earlier, we reported on predictive anomaly detection PAD, fornominating targets within datastreams generated by persistent sensingand surveillance. This technique is purely temporal and does notdirectly depend on the physics attendant on the sensed environment.Since PAD adapts to evolving data streams, there are no determinacyassumptions. PAD was shown to be general across sensor types,having been demonstrated using synthetic chaotic data and in audio,visual, and infrared applications. Defenseoriented demonstrationsincluded explosions, muzzle flashes, as well as missile and aircraftdetection.As new sensors come on line, PAD offers immediate data filtering andtarget nomination. Its results can be taken individually, pixel by pixel, forspectral analysis and material detectionidentification. They can also begrouped for shape analysis, target identification, and trackdevelopment. Data reduction from PAD analyses is generally around95, depending on target number and size.While PADs code is simple when compared to physics codes, PADtends to build a huge model. Typically, a PAD model for 320 x 640frames contains 14.4 million Gaussian basis functions. PAD modelsgrow linearly with the number of pixels and the frequency content, inthe FFT sense, of the sensed scenarios background data.Work is needed to improve PADs computational throughput whileemploying existing infrastructure, yet allowing for growth in the types ofhardware employed. In this present paper, we discuss a generic clusterinterface for legacy codes that can be partitioned at the data level. Thediscussions foundation is the growth of PAD models to accommodate aparticular scenario and the need to reduce false alarms while preservingall targets. The discussion closes with a view of future software andhardware opportunities.Conf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI276 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656719, Session 4Timefrequency transform techniques for seabed andburied target classificationM. Barbu, E. Kaminsky, R. E. Trahan, Jr., Univ. of New OrleansAn approach for processing sonar signals with the ultimate goal of oceanbottom sediment classification and underwater buried targetclassification is presented this paper. Work reported is based on sonardata collected by the Volume Search Sonar VSS as well as on simulateddata. The technique is based on the Fractional Fourier Transform FrFTand joint timefrequency representations of the signal. The classificationis based on singular value decomposition of the various timefrequencydistributions applied to the impulse response obtained using FractionalFourier transform. The set of the singular values represents the desiredfeature vectors that describe the properties of the signal. The relevantfeatures singular values have been mapped in a reduced dimensionspace where competing techniques for acoustic seabed sedimentclassification have been employed and compared. Of particular interestfor underwater classification applications are long targets such as cablesof various diameters, which need to be identified as different from otherstrong reflectors or point targets. Synthetic test data are used toexemplify and evaluate the technique. Results are presented thatillustrate the processing procedure and show that the algorithm providesan accurate way to classify buried objects with high probability of correctclassification.656721, Session 5A survey of PHD filter related researchR. P. S. Mahler, Lockheed Martin Co.The probability hypothesis density PHD filter has attracted increasinginterest since the author first introduced it in 2000.  Potentially practicalcomputational implementations of this filter have been devised, based onsequential Monte Carlo or on Gaussian mixture techniques.  Researchgroups in at least a dozen different nations are investigating the PHDfilter and its generalization, the CPHD filter, for use in variousapplications.  Some of this work suggests that the PHD filter may, undercertain circumstances, outperform conventional multitarget filters suchas MHT and JPDA.    The purpose of this paper is to summarize theseresearch efforts and their findings.656722, Session 5A unified Bayesian theory of measurementsR. P. S. Mahler, Lockheed Martin Co.Bayesian target detection, tracking, and identification is based on therecursive Bayes filter and its generalizations.  This filter requires thatmeasurements be transformed into likelihood values.  Conventionallikelihoods model the randomness of conventional measurements.  Othermeasurement types involve not only randomness but also imprecision,vagueness, uncertainty, and contingency.  Conventional measurementsand target states are also mediated by precise, deterministic models.But in general these models can also involve imprecision, vagueness, oruncertainty.  This paper describes three major types of generalizedmeasurements and their associated generalized likelihood functions.We also point out that for certain types of generalized measurements,fuzzy, DempsterShafer, and rulebased measurement fusion can berigorously reformulated as special cases of Bayes rule.656723, Session 5Missionbased situational awareness sensor managementand information fusionA.

Chen, Scientific Systems Co., Inc. C. Lee, A. Budhiraja, The Univ.of North Carolina at Chapel Hill R. K. Mehra, Scientific Systems Co.,Inc.Under a United States Army Small Business Technology Transfer STTRproject, we have developed a MATLAB toolbox called PFLib to facilitatethe exploration, learning and use of Particle Filters by a general user. Afilter is implemented as a MATLAB object which operates in thefollowing fashion First, the filter object is created initialized withinformation regarding the specific problem under consideration function handles of the state transition equation and measurementequation, and the statistics of the noises that enter into them additively.After this, the filtering is performed recursively. At each iteration, thefilter object takes as input the newly arrived measurement, conductsinternal computations and updates, and provides readout results of thefiltering, such as sample mean and covariance. The inner working of thefilter is thus encapsulated and need not be programmed by a generaluser, while at the same time the usage of any kind of filter has aconsistent Application Programming Interface API.There are five categories of filters implemented the Extended KalmanFilter EKF, the Bootstrap Particle Filter , the Particle Filter with an EKFtype proposal distribution, the Auxiliary Particle Filter, and theInstrumental Variable Particle Filter. Resampling schemes include None,Simple Resampling, Residual Resampling, BranchandKill, and SystemResampling. Other available choices include sampling frequency,number of particles, and Jacobians.The initialization and filtering described above is achieved throughscripting in MATLAB. To further facilitate a general user, a GraphicalUser Interface GUI is also provided that interactively collects filterchoices and parameters from the user, and then automaticallygenerates corresponding initialization code and sample filtering codethat can be cutandpasted into other scripts.We are planning to release PFLib under a Free Open Source SoftwareFOSS model.Conf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 277656726, Session 6Analytical performance evaluation for autonomoussensor fusionK. C. Chang, George Mason Univ. M. E. Liggins II, The MITRE Corp.A distributed data fusion system consists of a network of sensors, eachcapable of local processing and fusion of sensor data.  There has beena great deal of work in developing distributed fusion algorithmsapplicable to a network centric architecture.  Currently there are at leasta few approaches including nave fusion, crosscorrelation fusion,information fusion, maximum a posteriori MAP fusion, channel filterfusion, and covariance intersection fusion, some of which assume afixed global knowledge of the communications architecture.However, in general, in a distributed sensor system, the communicationarchitecture is not fixed.  Each node has knowledge of only its localconnectivity but not the global network topology.   In those cases, thedistributed fusion algorithm based on information filter type of approachmay not scale due to its requirements to carry a long petigreeinformation for decorrelation.In this paper, we focus on scalable fusion algorithms and conductanalytical performance analysis to compare their performance.  Thegoal is to understand the performance of those algorithms underdifferent operating conditions.  Specifically, we evaluate theperformance of channel filter fusion, Chernoff fusion, Shannon Fusion,and Battachayya fusion algorithms.  We also compare their results toNave fusion and optimal information filter algorithms under a specificcommunication pattern.656727, Session 6A testbed for architecture and fidelity trade studies in theBayesian decisionlevel fusion of ATR productsK. J. Erickson, Jacobs EngineeringDecisionlevel fusion is an appealing extension to automaticassistedtarget recognition ATR as it is a lowbandwidth technique bolstered bya strong theoretical foundation that requires no modification of thesource algorithms. The ATR problem itself provides the main hindranceto fusion, in its high cost and relative scarcity of training data, itsvariability in application, the inability to produce truly random samples,and its sensitivity to context.  Systems utilizing decisionlevel fusion ofATR outputs must characterize the operating environment and exploitATR performance models at levels commensurate with thesophistication of the fusion algorithm. The Air Force ResearchLaboratory AFRL Sensors Directorate ATR Thrust has begun theFusion for Identifying Targets Experiment FITE for the express purposeof examining the tradeoffs inherent among conditions affecting thetarget, the fidelity of the ATR performance model, the accuracy of priorinformation, and the complexity of the fusion algorithm. This papersummarizes the mathematics underlying decisionlevel fusion in theATR domain and describes a MATLABbased architecture for exploringthe trade space thus defined. Experiment definitions suitable for multilook and multisensor fusion systems are presented.656728, Session 6Survey of approaches and experiments in decisionlevelfusion of automatic target recognition ATR productsT. D. Ross, Air Force Research Lab.The limitations in the reliability of singlesource ATR products and thegrowing sensor data collection capabilities of modern armed forceshave made the fusion of ATR products a priority.  This data combinationcould improve the accuracy and detail of information while simplifyingits presentation.  Even when restricting consideration to decisionlevelcombination of identity data a subset of level 1 fusion, as we do in thissurvey, there is a large trade space of fusion approaches.  The properapproach depends on many factors, including the type of informationavailable, the accuracy of that information, and how well the uncertaintyof that information is known.  Similarly, the technology requirements forfusion sources should be driven, at least in part, by what best enablescontributions to a fusion system.  The US Air Force ResearchLaboratory AFRL is exploring this trade space in the Fusion forIdentifying Targets Experiment FITE program.  As part of this program,a survey of decisionlevel fusion approaches and experiments has beenconducted.  This paper reports on the findings of that survey, whichplaces the various studies in a common framework, identifies persistenttrends, and makes recommendations on the additional studies thatwould best inform the trade space of how to fuse ATR products andhow ATR products should be improved to support fusion.656729, Session 6ROC curve formulas for fused correlated classificationsystemsC. M. Schubert, Virginia Commonwealth Univ. S. N. Thorsen, M. E.Oxley, Air Force Institute of TechnologyThe Receiver Operating Characteristic ROC curve can be used toquantify the performance of Automatic Target Recognition ATRsystems.  When multiple classification systems are fused, theassumption of independence is usually made in order to mathematicallycombine the individual ROC curves for each of these classificationsystems into one fused ROC curve.  However, correlation may existbetween the classification systems and the outcomes used to generateeach ROC curve. This paper will demonstrate a method for creating aROC curve of the fused classification systems which incorporates thecorrelation that exists between the individual classification systems.Specifically, we will use the derived covariance between multipleclassification systems to compute the existing correlation and thus thelevel of dependence between pairs of classification systems.  Then,given a fusion rule, two systems, and the correlation between them, theROC curve for the fused system is produced.  We generate the formulafor the Boolean OR and AND rules, giving the resultant ROC curve forthe fused system.  This paper extends our previous work in whichbounds for the ROC curve of the fused, correlated classificationsystems were presented.656730, Session 7Aerial video and ladar imagery fusion for persistenturban vehicle trackingP. L. Cho, D. Greisokh, R. C. Knowlton, MIT Lincoln Lab.Automating Urban Situational Awareness represents an increasinglycritical intelligence objective. A robust capability to continuouslymonitor vehicle activity within complex cities is especially needed touncover ground mover trends. Lincoln Laboratory researchers arecurrently building a persistent video surveillance system which exhibitsimpressive automated tracking ability. But maintaining lock onthousands of cars with aerial video input alone is formidably difficult.In this talk, we report upon incorporating static 3D geometry informationinto the urban vehicle tracking problem. Using recent persistent videodata collected over a city with minimal terrain content, we first quantifysources of automated tracking termination and identify those whichcould be ameliorated by detailed height maps. They include imagerymisregistration 25, roadway occlusion 15 and vehicledeceleration 27. We next develop tractable mathematical models toanalyze the tracking value of spatial geometry knowledge in general andhigh resolution ladar imagery in particular. Simulation and algorithmresults demonstrate how 3D information could eliminate large numbersof spurious tracks passing through impenentrable urban structures.False track rejection would in turn permit Kalman filter coasting times tobe signficantly increased. Track lifetimes for vehicles occluded by treesand buildings as well as for cars turning corners or slowing down atintersections could consequently be prolonged. We find high resolution3D imagery would ideally yield an 83 reduction in the rate ofautomated vehicle tracking failure.Conf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI278 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656731, Session 7Advanced activity reporting in a multilayered unattendedground sensor networkT. Joslin, Harris Corp.Sensor networks are emplaced throughout the world to remotely trackactivity.  Typically, these sensors report data such as target direction ortarget classification.  This information is reported to a soldier basedmonitor or a command center.  The ideal sensor system will have a longmission life capability and will report informationrich actionableintelligence with high data integrity with near realtime latency.  Thispaper discusses a multilayered approach that includes data fusion atthe sensor node, sensor network, and command center layer to createcohesive reports that mitigate false alarms and multiple reports of thesame target while providing accurate tracking data on a situationalawareness level.  This approach is influenced by lowpowerarchitecture, and designed to maximize information density and reduceflooding of sensor networks.656732, Session 7The use of optical RF network for target detection andtrackingM. Li, ConsultantAn optical RF network 1 is comprised of distributed antennasubsystems and a center for processing RF signals.  It is different froman optical communication or computer network.  Although thesenetworks all use optical fibers or direct lasers for networking, they arefundamentally different.  In an optical RF network, the informationcontained in optical signals, which are being sent between antennasubsystems and the center, is usually unknown.  The optical signals willonly reveal the information carried by RF signals after processing at thecenter.  This is not the case for the optical communication or computernetwork.  The information in optical signals, which are being sentbetween communication or computer nodes, is known.What information is contained in an RF signal depends on how it isprocessed.  For instance, a direct conversion from a pulsed RF signal toa digital signal through fast RF digitizers or to an IF signal through superheterodyne only retains a small fraction of the information but themajority of the information is lost.  Hence the RF signal should never beconverted before processing.  The optical RF network will avoid theabove problem.The present talk will discuss the use of optical RF network, includingoptical fiber based radar and optical RF stereo, to advance radartechnology in target detection and tracking.1.

Wei, G. Chen, Intelligent Automation Inc. J. B. Cruz, Jr., TheOhio State Univ.In recent years substantial effort has been dedicated to predictingpossible enemys course of actions COA under hostile environments.Pointpatternbased density models are popular tools for such researchareas. Since it is well known that adversarial actions tend to clusteraccording to geography preferences and timing features, it is natural topay attention to clustering of COAs over the geographical sites andassume such clustering will persist over a long enough time horizon sothat prediction is possible. For example, a most popular andfundamental assumption in crime prediction system is journey tocrime, which believes that COA initiators tend to choosegeographically closer sites to start next COA. This assumption providesthe base for various hotspot prediction techniques, which are allbranches of pointpatternbased density models. Recently the mostwidely used method is the Spatial and Temporal Analysis of CrimeSTAC program that tries to fit crimes points into ellipses. There areadditional hotspot methods, and some of them apply kernel densityestimation and achieve reasonable benefits.One important point is that all these approaches assume that theenemys current tactics pattern or preference will persist over the future.This might be reasonable enough if the enemies are unorganized riotsfor in such cases the strikes approximately follow some probabilitydistribution, such as Poisson distribution. However, intelligent andorganized adversaries will not display random choices when choosingstrategies. They would like to estimate the possible benefits and risksand choose or change strategy purposefully instead of choosingstrategies randomly. Moreover, they might execute surprise attacksdeliberately to violate predictions based solely on probability theory.We propose a game theoretic approach to predict the possible changesof features. This is because the basic logic of game theory is to predictahead via all available information, including past data and possiblechoices at current stage. It has the following advantages 1 No delay. Itdoes not need to wait for the enemys change happening firstly 2 Moretrustable. Such prediction is often selfenforcing ue to the properties ofNash solutions.This paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we will summarize thetechnical approach, which includes problem description, benefitupdating mechanisms, objective functions, and calculation of optimalcontrol strategies. Section III describes the experimental results andexplanations. Section IV provides conclusions for the paper.656735, Session 8Statistical comparison of the hybrid approach with pureand exact inference models for fusion 2K. D. Lee, E. Wiesenfeld, A. Gelfand, Decisive Analytics Corp.One of the greatest challenges in modern combat is maintaining a highlevel of timely Situational Awareness SA.  In many situations,computational complexity and accuracy considerations make thedevelopment and deployment of realtime, highlevel inference toolsvery difficult. An innovative hybrid framework that combines Bayesianinference, in the form of Bayesian Networks, and Possibility Theory, inthe form of Fuzzy Logic systems, has recently been introduced toprovide a rigorous framework for highlevel inference.  In previousresearch, the theoretical basis and benefits of the hybrid approach havebeen developed.  However, lacking is a concrete experimentalcomparison of the hybrid framework with traditional fusion methods, todemonstrate and quantify this benefit.  The goal of this research,therefore, is to provide a statistical analysis on the comparison of theaccuracy and performance of hybrid network theory, with pure BayesianConf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 279and Fuzzy systems and an inexact Bayesian system approximatedusing Particle Filtering.  To accomplish this task, domain specificmodels will be developed under these different theoretical approachesand then evaluated, via Monte Carlo Simulation, in comparison tosituational ground truth to measure accuracy and fidelity.  Followingthis, a rigorous statistical analysis of the performance results will beperformed, to quantify the benefit of hybrid inference to other fusiontools.656736, Session 8Hybrid methodology for situation assessment modeldevelopment within an air operations center domainP. G. Gonsalves, C. D. Call, S. Ho, Charles River Analytics, Inc.Within the dynamic environment of an Air Operations Center AOC,effective decisionmaking is highly dependent on timely and accuratesituation assessment. In previous research efforts the capabilities andpotential of a Bayesian belief network BN modelbased approach tosupport situation assessment have been demonstrated. In our own priorresearch, we have presented and formalized a hybrid process forsituation assessment model development that seeks to amelioratespecific concerns and drawbacks associated with using a BNbasedmodel construct. Specifically, our hybrid methodology addresses thesignificant knowledge acquisition requirements and the associatedsubjective nature of using subject matter experts SMEs for modeldevelopment. Our methodology consists of two distinct functionalelements an offline mechanism for rapid construction of a Bayesianbelief network BN library of situation assessment models tailored todifferent situations and derived from knowledge elicitation with SMEsand an online machinelearningbased mechanism to learn, tune, oradapt BN model parameters and structure. The adaptation supports theability to adjust the models over time to respond to novel situations notinitially available or anticipated during initial model construction, thusensuring that the models continue to meet the dynamic requirements ofperforming the situation assessment function within dynamicapplication environments such as an AOC. In this paper, we apply anddemonstrate the hybrid approach within the specific context of an AOCbased air campaign monitoring scenario. We detail both the initialknowledge elicitation and subsequent machine learning phases of themodel development process, as well as demonstrate modelperformance within an operational context.656738, Session 9Automatic building detection and 3D shape recoveryfrom single monocular electrooptic imageryD. A. Lavigne, Defence RD CanadaValcartier Canada A. Dlugan,N. Goldstein, P. Saeedi, H. H. Zwick, MacDonald, Dettwiler Associates Ltd. CanadaThe extraction of 3D building geometric information from high resolutionelectrooptical imagery is becoming a key element in numerousgeospatial applications. Indeed, producing 3D urban models is arequirement for a variety of applications such as spatial analysis ofurban design, military simulation, and site monitoring of a particulargeographic location. However, almost all operational approachesdeveloped over the years for 3D building reconstruction are semiautomated ones, where a skilled human operator is involved in the 3Dgeometry modelling of building instances, which results in a timeconsuming process. Furthermore, such approaches usually requirestereo image pairs, image sequences, or laser scanning of a specificgeographic location to extract the 3D models from the imagery. Finally,with current techniques, the 3D geometric modelling phase may becharacterized by the extraction of 3D building models with a lowaccuracy level.This paper describes the Automatic Building Detection ABD systemand embedded algorithms currently under development. The ABDsystem provides a framework for the automated detection of buildingsand the recovery of the 3D geometric models from single monocularelectrooptic imagery. The system is designed in order to cope withmultisensor imaging of arbitrary viewpoint variations, clutter, andocclusion. Preliminary results on monocular airborne and spaceborneimages are provided. Accuracy assessment of detected buildings andextracted 3D building models from single airborne and spacebornemonocular imagery of real scenes are also addressed. Embeddedalgorithms are evaluated for their robustness to deal with relativelydense and complicated urban environments.656739, Session 9Application of a dynamic feature selection algorithm tomultisensor image registrationS. P. DelMarco, H. F. Webb, V. T. Tom, D. Lefebvre, BAE SystemsAdvanced Information TechnologiesImage registration is usually a required first processing step for suchactivities as surveillance, video tracking, change detection, and remotesensing. Often, different sensors are used for the collection of the testand reference imagery. The sensor phenomenology differences canpresent problems for automatic selection of registration algorithmparameters because of different crosssensor feature manifestation. Inprevious work involving edgebased multisensor image registration, weapplied a previouslydeveloped automated approach to parameterselection, designed specifically for edge detection. In this work, weadapt and apply a dynamic feature selection algorithm DFSA that werecently developed for use in registration algorithm selection forregistering images with varying scene content type. We adapt and applythe DFSA to the problem of selecting appropriate registration algorithmparameter values in an edgebased registration algorithm. Theapproach involves generating testtoreference feature match scoresover a sampling of the transform hypothesis space. The approach issceneadaptive thereby requiring no a priori information on image scenecontent. Furthermore, in the DFSA we leverage prior match scorecalculation generated in a hierarchical grid search to reduce additionalcomputational expense. We give a brief overview of the registrationalgorithmic framework, and present a description of the dynamic featureselection algorithm. Numerical results are presented for performing testSARtoreference EO image registration to show the registrationconvergence performance improvement resulting from use of the DFSA.Numerical results are generated over images exhibiting different scenecontent types. We also evaluate the effect of match score normalizationon the registration convergence performance improvement.656740, Session 9A verification metric for multisensor image registrationS. P. DelMarco, V. T. Tom, H. F. Webb, D. Lefebvre, BAE SystemsAdvanced Information TechnologiesAccurate geolocation of imagery produced from airborne imagingsensors is a prerequisite for precision targeting and navigation.However, the geolocation metadata often has significant errors whichcan degrade the performance of applications using the imagery. Whenreference imagery is available, image registration can be performed aspart of a bundleadjustment procedure to reduce metadata errors.Knowledge of the metadata error statistics can be used to set theregistration transform hypothesis search space size. In setting thesearch space size, a compromise is often made between computationalexpediency and search space coverage. It therefore becomesnecessary to detect cases in which the true registration solution fallsoutside of the initial search space. To this end, we develop a registrationverification metric, for use in a multisensor image registration algorithm,which measures the verity of the registration solution. The verificationmetric value is used in a hypothesis testing problem to make a decisionregarding the suitability of the search space size. Based on thehypothesis test outcome, we close the loop on the verification metric inan iterative algorithm. We expand the search space as necessary, andreexecute the registration algorithm using the expanded search space.We first provide an overview of the registration algorithm, and thendescribe the verification metric. We generate numerical results of theverification metric hypothesis testing problem in the form of ReceiverOperating Characteristics curves illustrating the accuracy of theapproach. We also discuss normalization of the metric across scenecontent.Conf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI280 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656741, Session 9Detecting small changes in images with parallaxM.

Stein, Univ. of New OrleansIn this work, a target detection technique based on a multiresolutionwavelet scheme is presented for SAR imaging. The technique includes amultiscale singularity detection and characterization step. This step isemployed in order to extract features that identify clutterbased texturalregions, as well as targets. More specifically, clutter regions are areascharacterized by a significantly large number of singularities. On theother hand, targets are described by isolated singularity contours. Insome cases, isolated clutter objects may exhibit properties similar to thatof a target. However, examination of the singularity types though differentscales can differentiate between targets and clutter objects. A significantadvantage of the proposed technique compared to previous targetdetection approaches is that it provides excellent target localization.Therefore, multiple targets in close proximity can be detected.Furthermore, targets located nearby clutter regions can be identified.Several mixtures of targets and clutter regions are considered in order toexamine various realistic scenarios. Experimental results have illustratedthat the proposed technique provides higher percentage of detectionthan the previously introduced CFAR and Extended Fractal models.656744, Session 9Morphological component analysis and STAP filtersH. C. Morris, Modal Research M. De Pass, Claremont Graduate Univ.STAP is an adaptive filtering algorithm that works on spacetime radardata to suppress the effects of clutter and jamming and achieve bothtarget identification and parameter estimation in airborne and spacebased radar. The signals to which STAP processes are applied consist ofthree basic parts target, clutter and jamming. In MorphologicalComponent Analysis MCA, the component signals are separated byassuming that each signal component can be sparsely represented insome suitable dictionary. It is assumed that expansions of a given signalcomponent in the dictionaries of the other signal components, are nonsparse. The MCA algorithm seeks a solution through an optimizationmethod that implements this sparserepresentation concept. Thisapproach has recently been applied to the analysis of ISAR images by H.Morris, M. De Pass. In this paper we consider the basic STAP equationsas a problem in Multichannel Morphological Component AnalysisMMCA. The method is illustrated by application to simulated data withKdistributed clutter.656745, Session 9Highdimensional feature space partitioning usingclassification catch cover digraphsM. A. Ordaz, A. J. Patterson, D. E. Waagen, N. N. Shah, E.Whittenberger, Raytheon Missile SystemsIn highdimensional settings, direct estimation of classconditionedprobability densities is generally constrained in practice by limited classsample sizes and the associated curse of dimensionality. Yet estimatingthe similarities and differences of feature distributions in these spaces isnecessary for evaluating feature utility and ultimately classificationefficacy. Therefore an efficient and effective approach for partitioninghighdimensional spaces into informative regions is of interest. In thisregard, we propose application of the Classification Catch CoverDigraph algorithm for informative feature space partitioning. Anevaluation of the classification efficacy of the partitions produced isdemonstrated in a realworld setting.656746, Session 9A spectral independent morphological adaptive classifierJ. B. Montgomery, C. Montgomery, MM Aviation R. Sanderson, AirForce Research Lab.Effective missile warning and countermeasures continue to be anunfulfilled goal for the Air Force and DOD community.  To make theexpectations a reality, sensors exhibiting the required sensitivity, field ofregard, and spatial resolution are being pursued.  The largest concern isin the first stage of a missile warning system, detection, in which alltargets need to be detected with a high confidence and with very fewfalse alarms.  Typical sensors are limited in their detection capability bythe presence of heavy background clutter, sun glints, and inherentsensor noise.  Many threat environments include false alarm sourceslike burning fuels, flares, exploding ordinance, and industrial emitters.Multicolor discrimination is one of the effective ways of improving theperformance of missile warning sensors, particularly for heavy cluttersituations.  Its utility has been demonstrated in multiple fielded systems.Utilization of the background and clutter spectral content, coupled withadditional spatial and temporal filtering techniques have resulted in arobust adaptive realtime algorithm to increase signaltoclutter ratiosagainst point targets.  The algorithm is outlined and results againsttactical data are summarized and compared in terms of computationalcost expected to be implemented on a realtime fieldprogrammablegate array processor.656747, Session 10A fuzzy rule base system for objectbased featureextraction and classificationX. Jin, S. Paswaters, ITT Visual Information SolutionsIn this paper, we present a fuzzy rule base system for objectbasedfeature extraction and classification on remote sensing imagery. First,the object primitives are generated from the segmentation steps. Objectprimitives are defined as individual regions with a set of attributescomputed on the regions. The attributes computed include spectral,texture and shape measurements. Crisp rules are very intuitive to theusers. They are usually represented as GE greater than, LE lessthan and IB In Between with numerical values. It can be manuallygenerated by query on the attributes and monitoring the resultingselected object primitives. However, the attributes of different featuresare usually overlapping. The information is inexact and not suitable fortraditional digital onoff decisions. Here a fuzzy rule base system is builtto better model the uncertainty inherent in the data and vague humanknowledge. Rather than representing attributes in linguistic variableslike Low, Median, High, we proposed a new method for automaticfuzzification of the traditional crisp concepts GE, LE and IB. Twosets of membership functions are defined to model those concepts.One is based on the piecewise linear functions, the other is based on Stype membership functions. A novel concept fuzzy tolerance isproposed to control the degree of fuzziness of each rule. Theexperimental results on classification and extracting features such asriver, roads and buildings have shown that this new designed fuzzy rulebase system is intuitive to the users and facilitate the users to generatefuzzy rules.Conf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 281656748, Session 10Novel lockin amplifier for identification of luminescentmaterials for authenticationA. D. McAulay, Lehigh Univ.We previously, over the past decade,  constructed and deliveredhandheld low cost electronic signal processing boxes for opticaldetection and identification of phosphors.  We describe and simulate anovel lowcost handheld lockin amplifier based approach, notpreviously proposed to our knowledge,  that uses phosphor stimulationfrequency, emission frequency and lifetime decays to uniquely identify aphosphor at a distance of many feet  in a noisy environment. A pulsedlaser diode stimulates the phosphor at a distance of several feet.  Thenovel receiver based on the lockin amplifier detects weakluminescence generated at a phosphor  in the presence of  daylight,sunlight, electronic noise and reflection of the stimulating beam. As thestimulating collimated beam diverges slowly on reflection, it is millionsof times stronger at the receiver than the signal from the weakluminescence that emits over a 4 Pi beam pattern. Mirrors must bedetected as counterfeit. In addition to relying on the different stimulationand emission frequencies, different luminescing materials aredistinguished from their decay times by a novel matched filter techniqueinside the lockin amplifier.  Reading through cardboard is describedwhere the authentification phosphor is inside a tamper proof package.Applications include pharmaceuticals, paper currency, clothingmaterials, and friend and foe identification from paint and clothing.656749, Session 10Robust modulation classification techniques based onhierarchical neural networksJ. DeClouet, M. NaraghiPour, Louisiana State Univ.The problem of automatic modulation classification is to identify themodulation type of a received signal from the signal parameters.Modulation classification has both military and civilian applications andhas been the subject of intensive research for more than two decades.In this paper we use a hierarchical neural network in which the firstnetwork identifies the modulation class while a second set of networksidentify the constellation size order of that modulation class. The set offeatures we use include normalized standard deviations of amplitude,phase and frequency, as well as the fourth and sixth order cumulants ofthe signal samples. Identifying the constellation size of quadratureamplitude modulation QAM has been particularly difficult in the past. Inthis paper we introduce two new approaches for computing thefeatures of a QAM signal. The first uses the concatenated inphase andquadrature components of the signal to compute the features. Thesecond method maps the inphase and quadrature components to thefirst quadrant of the constellation by calculating the absolute value ofeach separately. The mean of the resulting constellation points is thensubtracted before calculating the features. Simulation results will bepresented for classification of several digital modulation schemesincluding FSK, PSK, ASK and QAM.

The primary goal of theproposed system is to capture incoming stereo vision  feeds, examineand compare targets across the cameras, and using a derived cameracalibration matrix, project them in realworld 3D coordinates, all in realtime.  The system is divided into three main components  Cameracalibration, camera synchronization, and tracking and crosscameraobject matching.  In the proposed  system, algorithms such as 8pointfeature matching form the basis for the camera calibrationposeestimation mechanism, while motion frequency, color, and shape form arobust tracking and crosscamera feature matching stage.  Camerasynchronization issues are also addressed.  The system operates in aninitialization phase and in an analysis phase.  In the initialization phase,the cameras pose estimation, i.e., camera calibration, is performed.   Inthe analysis phase, the object tracking, feature matching, and crosscamera target association are performed.

Elor, RAFAEL Armament Development Authority Ltd. IsraelWe present a model for calculating the Spatial Frequency ResponseSFR for Bayer pattern color detectors. The model is based on thecolor detector response for BW scenes. When a Bayer color detector iscompared to a BW detector, The SFR difference results from theinterpolation process. This process exists only in the Bayer patterndetectors. In this work we ascribe the MTF and the spurious responseto the interpolation process.The model may be applied to any linear interpolation. Although theinterpolation is linear it is not Shift Invariant SI. Therefore, calculatingthe interpolation MTF is not a trivial task. Furthermore, the interpolationcreates a spurious response. In order to calculate the interpolation SFRwe introduced a separable constraint for x and y directions by using ascene that varies only on one axis and is fixed on the other. We furtherassumed that the human eye also integrates in the direction of the fixedaxis. By using these two assumptions, we have been able to separatethe response into two axes and calculate the SFR.For long range scenes, colors saturation decreases, the colors are lessvisible and we mostly sense grey colors. In these cases the JohnsonCriteria can be roughly applied. In order to apply the Johnson Criteria,we need to know the MTF of the sensing system. The sensing systemMTF includes the interpolation MTF. We show that the interpolationprocess degrades the system performance compared to BW sensor.Another application of the model is in comparing different interpolationalgorithms.656753, Session 10Signal processing techniques for heterodyne differentialabsorption lidarJ.

Liang, Sr., B. Li, Sr., J. Wei, Y. Liu, Sr., H. Liu, Shanghai Institute ofMicrosystem and Information Technology ChinaSignal envelope is needed in many applications, for example, in groundmoving target detection algorithm, and demodulation incommunication. Traditional filters are used in many of these algorithms,but there is always envelope delay obtained by traditional filters. Theenvelope delay is deadly harmful to ground moving target detectionalgorithm, so it is necessary to reduce the envelope delay and get a realtime envelope.Much of previous work on obtaining signal envelope is applied in signalprocessing and communication where real time envelope is notnecessary. Further more, previous work mainly focused on thesmoothness of envelope and ignored the delay of envelope which isalso important in many applications, such as target detection in wirelesssensor network where real time is very important.This paper describes an approach which can reduce envelope delayeffectively to improve traditional filter. In some applications, traditionalfilter is applied to get the envelope of signal, but there is long envelopedelay using traditional filter which is not suitable for real time systems,such as ground moving target detection in wireless sensor network.This paper presents a weighted filer approach to reduce envelope delay.656760, Poster SessionAdaptive target segmentation using runtimeweightedfeaturesJ. Jung, H. Lee, D. Park, Korea Advanced Institute of Science andTechnology South Korea C. Park, J. Lee, Samsung Thales Co.,Ltd. South KoreaTarget segmentation plays an important role in the entire target trackingprocess. Pixel by pixel, it decides whether the current pixel belongs tothe target region or not. In the previous works, extracting an intensityhistogram was followed by binarization. The target region was classifiedaccording to whether the intensity of the current pixel is larger than acertain value. Many researches were focused on how to determine aproper threshold. In this paper, we employ more features such as timeaverage of intensity, intensity deviation, distance from the centroid ofthe target and etc., rather than intensity only. Each feature is weightedindividually and summed. Each weighting factor is controlled by theweighting logic and target region is determined by summation ofweighted features. The weighting logic compares the behavior of eachfeature in the target region with that in the background region. Then itgives a higher weight to the feature which has a large differencebetween the target region and the background region. So the proposedsegmentation method can control the priority of features adaptively andis robust to condition changes of various circumstances.656761, Poster SessionRealtime color transfer system for lowlevel light visibleand infrared images in YUV color spaceL.

Cheney, RensselaerPolytechnic InstituteWe present a new receiver design for spatially distributed aperturesaimed at detecting targets in an urban environment. First we expressthe received signal at each receive antennas in terms of the thereceived signal at the first antenna. To this end a distortedwave Bornapproximation is employed when modeling the scattering environment.We use this signal model to formulate a binary hypothesis test for thedetection problem. Finally, we derive the optimal linear receiver as thelinear filter which maximizes the signaltonoise ratio SNR of thecorresponding test statistic. The receiver operation amounts tocorrelating a filtered version of the measurement at the first antennawith measurements made at the other receive antennas. In the freespace case, the filter applied to the measurement reduces to a delayoperator. Here, this freespace receiver is referred to as a delaycorrelator.  We evaluate the  performance of the receiver onexperimental data collected in a multipath and clutterrich urbanenvironment. The experimental results indicate that the delaycorrelatoroffers significant improvement in detection performance compared to aconventional matched filter. This is attributed to the fact that matchedfiltering is more sensitive to inaccuracies in the assumptions about theGreens function than the delaycorrelator.  The delaycorrelator, on theother hand, incorporates the multipath distortion originating from thepath between transmitter and target  even when freespaceassumptions are employed between the target and the receiveantennas.656763, Poster SessionFace and automatic target recognition based on classspecific superresolution subspaceW. Asdornwised, Chulalongkorn Univ. ThailandRecently, superresolution reconstruction method of lowdimensionalface subspaces has been proposed for face recognition. However, thereconstructed features obtained from the facespecific superresolutionsubspace contain no class information. This paper proposes a novelmethod for superresolution reconstruction of classspecific featuresthat aims on improving the discriminant power of the recognitionsystems. Our experimental results on Yale and ORL face databases arevery encouraging. Furthermore, the performance of our approach on theMSTAR database is outperformed several stateoftheart AutomaticTarget Recognition ATR methods.656764, Poster SessionExact message passing algorithm for Bayesian netwrokwith loopsW. Sun, K. C. Chang, George Mason Univ.Distributed message passing algorithm provides exact probabilisticinference for polytree Bayesian networks.  When applying to networkwith loops, a modified method called loopy propagation wasdeveloped.  This loopy algorithm usually can converge and providereasonable approximate solutions.  However, in some cases it willoscillate between answers not necessary close to the true one.  In thisstudy, we propose an exact message passing algorithm for thenetworks with loops.  In such case, the variables involved in computingmessages are not independent as assumed in the original Pearlsmessage passing algorithm.  Instead, we compute the joint distributionsof corresponding variables and encode that in the message to bepassed when there are loops in the network.  We start with networks ofcontinuous variables and show that similar idea can be applied fordiscrete or hybrid networks.Conf. 6567 Signal Processing, Sensor Fusion, and Target Recognition XVI284 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssConf. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIVTuesdayWednesday 1011 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIV656801, Session 1GOTCHA experience report threedimensional SARimaging with complete circular aperturesE. Ertin, C. Austin, R. L. Moses, L. C. Potter, The Ohio State Univ.In this paper, we review the theory of three dimensional imaging withsynthetic aperture radar SAR traversing complete circular aperturesand present our results on the processing of GOTCHA database.GOTCHA data collection at WPAFB used a polarimetric  spotlight SARcovering several complete circular apertures of 360 degrees at variouselevation angles. Circular SAR collection geometry provides wide angleinformation about the nonisotropic  reflectivity of the scattering centersin the scene. In addition, unlike the linear collection geometry circularSAR reveals three dimensional information about the location of thescattering centers in the spotlighted area. The 3D localization capabilityof circular SAR is strongly influenced by the  reflectivity  persistence ofthe scattering centers as a function of the azimuth angle. In this paperwe provide a statistical characterization of persistence of scattererspresent in GOTCHA data and discuss implications on the 3D imageresolution. Second, we discuss sampling and storage requirements forcoherent wideangle circular SAR imagery. Next, we present enhancedimaging algorithms for multielevation circular SAR, which useregularization  to provide a sparse description of the target scene that isconsistent with the collected SAR data to combat sidelobes and noiseartifacts. Finally, we discuss low complexity three dimensionalreconstruction techniques using circular layover of polarimetric featuresto recover contours of vehicles and buildings in three dimensionalspace.656802, Session 1Threedimensional point spread functioncharacterization of a radially displaced scattererM. A. Temple, Air Force Institute of TechnologyFor SAR data collection systems utilizing a circular aperture for targetrecognition, it is important to know how a targets PSF behaves as afunction of various radar functional parameters and target positionalchanges which occur during data collection.  The pivot of this researchis characterizing the three dimensional point spread function 3DPSFbehavior of radially displaced point scatterers for circular syntheticaperture radar CSAR. For an ATR system requiring target identificationwith a higher degree of confidence, CSAR processing represents aviable alternative given it can produce images with resolution less thana wavelength.  When very large CSAR apertures are combined with highdepression angles 300 and higher, an interesting phenomenon occurs.Three dimensional imaging is possible with a single aperture and asingle CSAR pass. Using the backprojection image formation algorithm,we generate point target PSF responses using various point targetlocations, radar bandwidths, depression angles and CSAR aperturesazimuth angle spans.  Consistent with previous studies, the 3DPSFfor a point target located at the image center is cone shaped and servesas the basis for comparing and characterizing the PSFs for radiallydisplaced scatterers.  If this abstract is accepted for full paperconsideration, we will present a complete 3DPSF characterization forpoint scatterers by varying relevant parameters mentioned above.The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do notreflect the official policy or position of the United States Air Force,Department of Defense, or the U.S. Government.656803, Session 1Threedimensional resolution for circular syntheticaperture radarL. J. Moore, L. C. Potter, The Ohio State Univ.Threedimensional 3D spotlightmode Synthetic Aperture Radar SARimage processing is typically performed either by interferometry usingdata collected along identical azimuthal paths at multiple elevationangles or by reconstruction using data collected on a densely sampled3D grid in azimuth and elevation. This paper considers 3D imageformation using a circular SAR geometry with data collected along asingle, circular flight path of 360 degrees azimuth at a constantelevation angle. A closedform expression for the farfield 3D pointspread function PSF, or impulse response function IPR, for circularSAR is derived as a means of evaluating 3D resolution. Traditionally,authors have reported 3D resolution by taking distance to first null fromonaxis cuts of the 3D IPR.  Significantly, for wide apertures a pointscattering assumption is inadequate consequently, the spatialresolution is a function of both aperture and scattering response.New measures of volumetric resolution are presented and evaluated asa function of aperture and scattering persistence. A nonparametricmeasure is given by the volume of level sets from the PSF.  A parametricapproach uses the CramerRao lower bound and quantifies the relativeability to localize reflectors.  The analysis reveals the inadequate andmisleading conclusions drawn from the traditional, onaxis, onedimensional description of threedimensional resolution.  And, theanalysis quantifies 3D position uncertainty as a function of apertureand scattering persistence.656804, Session 1Exploitation of UAV trajectories with perturbation forintelligent circular SAR applicationsA. K. Mitra, T. L. Lewis, L. Willemsen, Air Force Research Lab.This paper outlines a concept for exploiting UAV Unmanned AerialVehicle trajectories for detecting slowly moving targets.   All theanalysis and simulation results are reported under the assumption of acircular UAV trajectory with various degrees of localized perturbations inthe neighborhood of a given circular trajectory.   These trajectoryperturbations are introduced and investigated in order to developintelligent processing algorithms for purposes of detecting slowlymoving targets.   The basic concept is based on collecting subapertures of data over a given set of localized trajectories andintelligently parsing the collected data based on  timevarying angleestimates between the localized UAV trajectory and subsets of  acollection of moving point targets.  This parsed data is intelligentlycombined over large SAR integration subintervals and intervals todevelop a novel approach to detecting moving targets with largevariations in speed and target trajectory.    Simulation results arereported for three different trajectory perturbation functions  1. Asmoothlyvarying or localized sinusoidal UAV trajectory in theneighborhood of a baseline circular trajectory   2.  A moderatelyfastlocalized triangular, or zigzag, UAV trajectory in the neighborhood of abaseline circular trajectory.    3.  A fast localized trajectory thatgenerates perturbations in the form of a shaped square wave in theneighborhood of a baseline circular trajectory.656805, Session 1Synthetic aperture imaging using sources of opportunityC. E. Yarman, Drexel Univ. B. Yazici, M. Cheney, RensselaerPolytechnic InstituteWe consider a Syntheticaperture radar SAR system in which thetransmitter   and receiver are located on different platforms.  Ourapproach applies when the transmitters are either cooperative or noncooperative i.e., are sources of   opportunity. In this work, thetransmitters can be either stationary or moving. We refer to such asystem as a SAR system.Conventional SAR systems correlate the received signal with thetransmitted waveform to suppress noise. For passive SAR, however, thetransmitted waveform is not necessarily known. Instead of theconventional matched filtering, we use the the spatial correlationmethods presented by Attia and Steinberg, and Chan, Kuga andIshimaru. Given a pair of receivers, the spatial correlation method spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 285compares the received signals to identify a target within the illuminatedscene.  We combine this with microlocal techniques used by Nolan andCheney to develop a filtered backprojection FBP type inversion methodfor passive SAR.Our method has the additional advantage that knowledge of the totaltravel time, from transmitter to target to receiver, is not needed. Themicrolocal techniques, moreover, provide approximate FBP typeinversion methods, which are known for their computational efficiency.Additionally, they have the desirable property that the visible edges ofthe scene not only appear at the right location with the right orientationbut also at the right strength in the reconstructed image.We form our images in three steps First correlate the received signalsnext filter the correlated signal and finally backproject the filteredcorrelation signals along certain surfaces. In our final manuscript, we willpresent an analysis of the computational complexity of the proposedmethod and demonstrate its performance in numerical simulations.656806, Session 1Bistatic synthetic aperture inversion for arbitrary flighttrajectoriesC. E. Yarman, Drexel Univ.In this paper we present an approximate analytic inversion method forbistatic synthetic aperture radar. We consider a bistatic syntheticaperture radar BiSAR, where a scene of interest is illuminated byelectromagnetic waves that are  transmitted from positions along anarbitrary, but known, flight trajectory and the scattered waves aremeasured from positions along a different flight trajectory which is alsoarbitrary, but known. Furthermore, we assume that the transmitter andreceiver antennas have poor directivity that the singlescatteringapproximation holds for the radar data and that the ground topographyis known but not necessarily flat.Reconstruction algorithms for monostatic SAR with poor antennadirectivity traversing straight and arbitrary flight trajectories have beendeveloped by various authors, while, to our knowledge, the acquisitiongeometry of bistatic SAR studies for the case of poor antenna directivityare limited to isotropic antennas traversing certain flight trajectoriesstraight or circular flight trajectories over flat topography.In this paper, we focus on bistatic SAR with poor antenna directivity andaddress the image reconstruction problem when transmitter and receiverare traversing arbitrary, but known, flight trajectories over known, but notnecessarily flat, topography. In particular, we use microlocal techniquesto develop a new filteredbackprojection FBP type BiSAR inversionmethod for arbitrary flight trajectories over nonflat topography. TheseFBP type reconstruction methods have the advantage that they arecomputationally efficient. In our final manuscript, we will present ananalysis of the computational complexity of the proposed method anddemonstrate its performance in numerical simulations.656807, Session 1Shadow detectors for moving target focusingF. A. LeeElkin, R. L. Dilsavor, SET Corp. M. McClure, DARPAIn this paper, we explore nontraditional approaches to track and locatemovers. These approaches are enabled by persistent RF sensing. Inparticular, we assume the availability of continuouslook slidingaperture SAR and change detection data streams and explore thefeasibility of tracking vehicle shadows in those data streams. Thosetracks provide accurate vehicle location even though the RF energybackscattered from the moving vehicle itself is smeared and displaced inthe images. Shadow Detectors developed by SET Corp. include anOrder Statistic CFAR, Complex Coherence and NonCoherent Changedetection. The details of the shadow detection techniques will bereviewed and a comparison between various techniques will be made.We also explore the feasibility of using the track kinematics to supportmoving target image formation and featureaided tracking. Theseapproaches provide the potential benefits of highaccuracy continuousrevisit tracking and single mode, single platform, and single channelimplementation that avoids expensive multiplatform coordination andlogistics challenges.656808, Session 1A comparison of nonquadratic regularizationimplementations on the backhoe data setA. S. Kondrath, B. D. Rigling, Wright State Univ.A sparseaperture imaging problem arises in synthetic aperture radarSAR when parts of the phase history data are corrupted or incomplete.The resulting images reconstructed from the sparse aperture SAR aredegraded, with elevated sidelobes. One effective method for enhancingthese images has been nonquadratic regularization. Regularized SARimage formation employs a cost function which contains two terms oneto measure image formation error and a second term  to emphasizefeature enhancement. In the past, a quasiNewtons method was usedto minimize the nonquadratic regularization cost function. We presenttwo alternative approaches which employ a stochastic gradientdescent. In this paper, these three algorithms are applied to corruptedphase history data and evaluated based on output image quality andtime required for image generation. Experiments were performed on thebackhoe data set.656809, Session 1Joint enhancement of multichannel SAR dataN. Ramakrishnan, E. Ertin, R. L. Moses, The Ohio State Univ.In this paper we study iterative methods for joint enhancement ofmultichannel Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR data. Previous work byCetin and Moses introduced nonquadratic regularization methods forimage enhancement using sparsity enforcing penalty terms. ModernSAR system can collect multichannel data providing diversity inelevation and polarization. One approach is to image and enhance eachchannel separately, which can lead to degraded performance inpostprocessing tasks such as SAR Interferometry for height estimation.We propose a method for  joint enhancement  of multichannel SAR datawith additional constraints for stable  postprocessing. We develop twoiterative methods for solving the constrained optimization problems withnonquadradatic sparsity penalty terms and demonstrate theperformance of the proposed methods on IFSAR height extractionproblem from multielevation data using the AFRL Backhoe datadome.Finally, we characterize noise immunity of joint and single channelenhancement methods using simulation studies.656810, Session 1Resolution analysis for wideangle SAR imagingS. He, National Univ. of Defense Technology ChinaIn wide angle synthetic aperture radar WASAR, two problems differentfrom conventional SAR are presented. First, the support region ofimaging is fanlike, not coincident with the rectangle support regionapproximatively assumed in conventional SAR. Second, the resolutionformulation for conventional SAR imaging is not right any more .Basedon the point spread function of the imaging system PSF, the resolutionfor wide angle SAR imaging is defined. And the resolution formulationversus the signal bandwidth and synthesized aperture for wide angleSAR is deduced. Further research implied that the range and crossrange resolution all increased as the increase of synthesized apertureangle,  if only the coherent aperture angle is wide enough even if thesignal bandwidth is narrow, high range resolution can be gotten, as isabsolutely different from the conventional SAR imaging. To furtherexplain the above conclusion, A SAR imaging method for the singlefrequencycarrier and wide angle SAR is simulated. This signal isproduced based on the scattering center model, the scattering centerslocations and amplitudes can be estimated through the signaldecomposition using the RELAX method. Simulation imaging resultsverified the validity of resolution formulation and the imaging algorithmfor wide angle SAR.Conf. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIV286 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656835, Session 1Characterizing geolocation ambiguity responses in SARGMTIM.

Inaebnit, Armasuisse SwitzerlandIn conjunction with measures for target recognition as well as for thecorresponding counteractive measures spatially resolved radarsignatures are of high importance.This contribution discusses new techniques and results which wereconducted and obtained in an indoor measurement range with variouscapabilities for radar signature evaluation from X to Wband. Themeasurement range is realized in a hall of size 30 x 20 x 10 m3 and isequipped with a 7.5 mdiameter target turntable with a 70ton capacity.A crane allows the antennas to be moved along two perpendicularhorizontal axes with very high accuracy 1 mm.The presented concepts aim for a decomposition of the radarbackscattering for a given frequency and aspect direction range intocontributions assigned to resolution cells being considerably smallerthan the overall size of the target. For microwave frequencies e. g. Xband a 3DISAR approach provides resolution cells with lineardimensions below about 3 wavelengths and a deterministicrepresentation of scattering data from the individual resolution cells. Areasonable adoption of this approach in the millimetre wave regime e.g.Wband fails in case of large targets typically linear dimensions .4m due to the enormous increase in the number of resolution cells.Instead spatial resolution is obtained with directive antennas physicalaperture and time gating. Furthermore, scattering of resolution cells isrepresented in terms of statistics.In the main part of the paper results obtained for test targets in the Xband are presented and discussed with respect to their performanceand their potential for radar signature models.656813, Session 2Threedimensional characterization of radar targets bymeans of ISARSAR nearfield imaging techniquesM. John, U. Aulenbacher, C. T. Inaebnit, Armasuisse SwitzerlandRadar detection and identification of airborne and ground targets relieson a detailed knowledge about their backscattering properties. Inversesynthetic aperture radar ISAR imaging techniques based on indoornearfield backscattering measurements turns out to be a powerful toolfor diagnostic purposes in RCS reduction and for deriving farfield RCStarget models, either deterministic in terms of RCS patterns or in termsof statistical parameters.Mostly used backscattering measurement setups with rotatingturntable, but fixed antenna position and beam direction pointingperpendicular to the axis of rotation provide the wellknown highresolution image of the 2D reflectivity distribution RD. Since a twodimensional projection of a threedimensional RD is in case of complextargets as e.g. for ground targets observed by airborne radar sensorsinsufficient, we developed an advanced 3D imaging approach, wherein a novel data collection geometry in addition to the turntable rotationthe antenna is moved along a linear path which is chosen in accordancewith the geometry of the target and the aspect angle of interest.Performance of this imaging system and its dependence on the choiceof various parameters is discussed. The employed reconstructionalgorithm is adopted from the concept of topographic imaging, butmodified with respect to a compensation of the range and angulardependence of the illuminating field. Furthermore, the position in spaceis characterized by a configurationspecific coordinate system. Resultsobtained for an automobile as Xband radar target are presented inorder to assess the features of the imaging system.The presentation is complemented by a critical survey about thepotential and limits of estimating farfield RCS data from reflectivitydistributions which are retrieved from nearfield measurements.656814, Session 2An endtoend simulator for highresolution spaceborneSAR systemsR. H. Speck, P. Turchi, H. Suess, DLR Standort OberpfaffenhofenGermanyThe generation of experimental SAR data representative of newadvanced systems is both expensive and time consuming, particularlywhere parameters and scenarios need to be varied. This is especiallytrue for spaceborne systems. The need for simulation tools for analysisand evaluation is, therefore, essential and necessary. Classical pointtarget simulators are normally used to test the focussing quality and thegeometric fidelity of processing algorithms. However, for an allembracing testing of the SAR systems capabilities the simulated datashould be similar to those detected at real SARmapping. Accordingly,the use of extended threedimensional scenes is required. The purposeof this paper is to present an endtoend simulator for high resolutionspaceborne SAR systems that is capable of simulating realistic rawdata and focussed images of extended threedimensional scenes. Thesimulator is based on precise mathematical modeling of an overall SARsystem chain and generates information on the quality of the imagedata and its suitability to interpret target and background signatures.The principal components of the simulator are the generation of theextended scene, including the fully polarimetric scattering behavior ofthe threedimensional surface and man made objects, and includingtypical SAR effects like overlay, speckle noise, shadowing an accurateSAR sensor simulation antenna, transmit and receive path generationof the raw data depending on the desired SAR mode stripmap,spotlight, hybrid mode image processing and evaluation. The flexibleand modular structure allows for adjustment and extension to fulfilldifferent tasks. The most important modules reflecting the basicphysical models will be described and simulation results will bedemonstrated.656815, Session 2Efficient algorithms for target validation using 3Dscattering featuresA. M. Raynal, The Univ. of TexasAustin R. Bhalla, ScienceApplications International Corp. H. Ling, The Univ. of TexasAustinV. Velten, Air Force Research Lab.In this paper we present efficient algorithms for target validation usingof 3D scattering features.  Building a high fidelity 3D CAD is a key stepin the target validation process.  3D scattering features wereintroduced previously Bhalla, et. al, SPIE 2005 to capture the spatialand angular scattering properties of a target.  The 3D scattering featurefor a target is obtained by using the 3D scattering centers predictedfrom the shooting and bouncing ray technique, and establishing acorrespondence between the scattering centers and their associatedangular visibility.  The 3D scattering feature can be interpreted to be amatched filter for a target, since the radar data projected onto thefeature are matched to the spatial and angular scattering behaviors ofthe target.  Furthermore, the 3D scattering features can be tied back tothe target geometries using the traceback information computedduring the extraction process.   By projecting the measured radar dataConf. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIV spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 287onto a set of 3D scattering features and looking at the associatedcorrelations and traceback information, the quality of the 3D targetCAD used for synthetic signature modeling can be quantified.  Thecorrelation and traceback information can point to regions of targetthat differ from the 3D CAD used for simulations.  Results for varioustargets using the algorithm will be presented.656816, Session 2Image exploitation for MiSARN. F. Heinze, Fraunhofer Institut fr InformationsundDatenverarbeitung Germany M. Edrich, EADS Deutschland GmbHGermany G. M. Saur, W. Krger, Fraunhofer Institut frInformationsund Datenverarbeitung GermanyThe miniature SARsystem MiSAR has been developed by EADSGermany for light weight UAVs like the LunaSystem, which theBundeswehr is operating in Afghanistan. MiSAR adds to these UAVsystems the allweather reconnaissance capability, which is missinguntil now.In a special imaging mode MiSAR generates SAR image sequenceswith approximately 1 Hz framerate. Photo interpreters PI of tacticaldrones, now mainly experienced with visual interpretation, are not usedto SARimages, especially not with SARimage sequencecharacteristics. So they should be supported to improve their ability tocarry out their task with a new, demanding sensor system. We havetherefore analyzed and discussed with military PIs in which tasks SARimage sequences can be used and how the PIs can be supported byspecial algorithms.Considering the results we have developed image processingalgorithms for such SARimage sequences. These algorithms areintegrated into an image exploitation system to improve the imageinterpreters ability to get a better oversight, better orientation andhelping them to detect relevant objects, especially considering flights ofe.g. 2 hours.A main component is the generation of image sequence mosaics to getmore oversight. This algorithm was initially developed to process videoimagery and was adapted to the special characteristics of MiSARimagery. The generation of mosaics is based on the extraction of imagefeatures from successive images and matching of these features. Fromthe matched features the transformation can be estimated and themosaic can be generated. This mosaicing has the advantage that alsonon straight linear flightpaths and varying squint angles can beprocessed.Another component is a screening for manmade objects to markregions of interest in the image sequence. We use a classification basedapproach, which can easily adapted to new sensors and scenes.656818, Session 2SAR data exploitation present and future computationaltechnology for enabling algorithm developmentU.

The power ofHPC clusters, FPGA and GPU systems, and the IBM cell processorspresent new algorithm development possibilities that have not beenfully leveraged. In this paper, we will illustrate the capability of SAR dataexploitation that was impractical last decade due to computinglimitations.  Examples will be provided that show SAR imageryencompassing city size coverage at extremely high levels of fidelityprocessed at nearreal time using the above technologies to empowerthe warfighter access to critical information for the war on terror,homeland defense, and urban warfare.656834, Session 2A comparison between imaging radar and medicalimaging polar format algorithm implementationsL.

Keaffaber, Veridian Inc.The processing of airborne multichannel radar data to cancel theclutter near moving ground targets can be accomplished throughDoppler filtering, with displaced phase center antenna DPCAtechniques, or by spacetime adaptive processing STAP. Typicalclutter suppression algorithms recently developed for moving groundtargets were designed to function with twochannel displaced phasecenter radar data.  This paper reviews the implementation of a twochannel clutter cancellation approach used in the past baselinetechnique, discusses the development of an improved twochannelclutter cancellation algorithm, and extends this technique to threechannel airborne radar data.  The enhanced performance of theimproved dual channel method is expanded upon by exploiting theextra information gained from a third channel. A significant improvementbetween the moving target signature level and the surrounding clutterlevel was obtained with the new KahlerKeaffaber algorithm whencomparing results from dualchannel and threechannel cluttersuppression to the baseline twochannel technique.656820, Session 3Waveform preconditioning for clutter rejectionT. K. Varslot, B. Yazici, C. Yarman, M. Cheney, RensselaerPolytechnic Institute L. L. Scharf, Colorado State Univ.We introduce the idea of preconditioning transmit waveforms foroptimal clutter suppression in pulseecho systems. The procedureinvolves determining a map on the space of transmit waveforms, andthen applying this map to waveforms before transmission.Waveform preconditioning for clutter suppression makes efficient use ofpower and computational resources by distributing power properly overa frequency band and by eliminating clutter filtering in receiveprocessing. Hence, for a given signaltoclutter ratio in the final image,the transmit power may be reduced. Alternatively, the signaltoclutterratio could be improved by boosting the transmit power whichpredominantly produces scattering from the target. The former willmake the transmitter antenna more difficult to detect without degradingthe performance, while the latter will improve performance with thesame total transmitpower constraint.Conf. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIV288 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssThe preconditioning is determined by making the composite target andclutter channel as close as possible to the target channel with respectto an optimality criterion. For radar imaging, we used the minimummeansquareerror criterion MMSE.The work applies to radar, sonar and microwave imaging systems withan arbitrary number of transmit and receiveantenna elements that arenot necessarily colocated.  While we focus our  attention on cluttersuppression specifically, the general idea of preconditioning appliesalso to other problems such as multipath suppression.656821, Session 3Multifrequency space time orthogonal projection MFSTOP radar signal processing algorithm for detectingand discriminating targets in heavy clutterY. Tamrat, C. J. Hatleberg, Apogen TechnologiesThe fundamental problem of detection and discrimination of targets inclutter and noise is to separate the signature of a target from unwantedinterference.  Detection and discrimination of a target in a clutteredbackground is a serious problem for remote sensing if the Radar CrossSection RCS of the target is low relative to the clutter RCS.  Prior todetection and discrimination, the interference must be mitigated.  Thisadvanced multifrequency radar signal processing algorithm addressesthe detection and discrimination of targets including those withunknown motion that are buried in heavy clutter with unknownstatistics.In this paper, we present a method of detection and discriminationbased on a two stage orthogonal projection whereby target parameterscan be extracted in the presence of heavy clutter and noise.  Theproposed technique detects targets within heavy clutter tracked by aradar system.  After targets are detected, motion information isextracted that can be used to discriminate threats such as reentryvehicles from other targets.Target detection is generated in stage one by a combination ofWindowed Short Time Fourier Transform WSTFT processing andPrincipal Component Analysis PCA. Target discrimination is done in asecond stage via Partial Least Squares PLS using a training filterconstructed from the stage one detection.  The target is discriminatedexplicitly by metric criteria such as size or precession. Thesediscriminate features do not have to be known a priori.656822, Session 3Singlepass detection and classification in LF FOPENSARD. Blacknell, QinetiQ Ltd. United KingdomLow frequency SAR is used to achieve foliage penetration thusrevealing targets concealed under vegetation canopies. At UHF, theclutter environment for target detection is quite severe as a result of themany returns from treetrunks in particular. Conventional automateddetection techniques rely on change detection to cancel out the staticclutter returns and hence reveal any targets that have moved into thescene. However, change detection requires scene revisit thus puttingconstraints on mission planning. In this paper, a technique for detectionand discrimination of targets from treetrunk returns is developed andvalidated using real SAR data. The technique exploits the varyingsignature characteristics of targets and treetrunks with changingaspect. The classification problem in LF SAR imagery also posessignificant difficulties since the long wavelengths used reveal little of thetarget structure. Classification techniques using synthetically generatedtraining imagery to classify LF ISAR turntable imagery have beenconsidered. The baseline performance has been established usingcorrelationbased methods. An analysis of dominant scattering eventsin terms of real structures on the targets has also been undertaken andclassification based on the association of dominant scattering eventshas been investigated. The techniques are outlined and the achievableLF target classification performance is discussed.656823, Session 3Motionsegmentation based change detectionW. Ye, D. Wu, W. L. Roberts, J. Li, Univ. of FloridaDetecting regions of change in images of the same scene taken atdifferent times is of widespread interest due to a large number ofapplications in diverse disciplines.  Important applications of changedetection include video surveillance, remote sensing, medical diagnosisand treatment, civil infrastructure, and underwater sensing.   Changedetection usually consists of three steps, namely, 1 geometricadjustment, a.k.a., image registration, to mitigate changes caused bycamera motion, 2 radiometricintensity adjustment to mitigate lightingvariation and noise, and 3 stochastic modeling and hypothesis testing,to decide which pixelarea experiences changes of interest.In this paper, we propose a novel motionsegmentation based approachto change detection.  Under this approach, we do not even need imageregistration since our method is able to separate global motion fromlocal motion object motion.   Hence, it is robust against cameramotion.   The key idea of our approach is as below.   We first estimateoptical flow based on the criterion of mean squared error or mutualinformation then we use optical flow equation to estimate parametersfor all possible motions then we segment the motions based on someclustering or vector quantization method after segmentation, we refinethe estimates of the parameters for all possible motions then wesegment the motions based on new parameter estimates we do thisrecursively until it converges.   Experimental results demonstrate thesuperior performance of our scheme, compared to the existingschemes.656825, Session 4Extraction of 3D attributed scattering center featuresfrom sparse aperturesJ. A. Jackson, R. L. Moses, The Ohio State Univ.Physicallybased attributed scattering feature models have shownpotential in aiding automatic target recognition and scene visualization.Attributed scattering features capture physical scattering geometry,including the limited response of target scattering over wide angles, thatis not discerned from traditional point scatter models.   Development oftools which extract attributed features from SAR data support the needfor accurate target recognition algorithms in difficult environments, suchas urban areas.   A number of collection geometries are currently beingconsidered to address needs of persistent surveillance and surveillanceto support urban operations.  We present recent results on featureextraction from sparse collection apertures that support thesesurveillance needs.  We build on previous work, presented at the 2006SPIE conference, in which we presented algorithms for featureextraction using a pair of fullypolarimetric IFSAR apertures that is,slightly displaced in elevation, and covering a linear azimuthal sweep.In this paper we consider more general apertures, including single,curved apertures that have both azimuth and elevation diversity that is,not straightline apertures.  These more general apertures present anumber of complications.  First, we are no longer able to exploit theenergy compactness of scattering features in the SAR image domain,as was the case in the IFSAR apertures.  On the other hand, thecombined azimuth and elevation diversity permits estimation anddisambiguation of scattering features that were in some casesindiscriminable from IFSAR aperture pairs.  Finally, we present resultson expected accuracy and accuracy bounds for scattering featureestimation uncertainty using these more general measurementapertures.656826, Session 4Improve ATR performance through distance metriclearningY. Sun, M. Xue, J. Li, Univ. of Florida S. R. Stanfill, Lockheed MartinCo.High resolution synthetic aperture radar images usually contain muchredundant and noisy irrelevant information. Eliminating theseConf. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIV spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 289information via feature extraction can greatly enhance ATRperformance, reduce processing time and increase the systemrobustness. Most existing feature extraction methods are eithercomputationally expensive or can only provide adhoc solutions andhave no guarantee of optimality. In this paper, we describe a newfeature extraction algorithm based on distance metric learning. Thealgorithm is based on the local learning strategy and is formulated as aconvex optimization problem. The algorithm is not only capable oflearning the feature significance and feature correlations in a highdimensional space but also very easy to implement and does not sufferfrom a local minima problem. Experimental results based on the MSTARdatabase are presented to verify the effectiveness of the new algorithm.656827, Session 4Coevolutionary feature synthesis for SAR targetclassification using transform featuresZ. He, G. Kuang, National Univ. of Defense Technology ChinaFeatures represent the characteristics of targets. The effectiveness ofthe feature set plays a key role in the performance of target recognition.Ideally, the feature set should contain the fewest features needed tomaximize the separation between classes. There are usually two waysto reach this goal feature selection and feature synthesis. In this paper,we use a coevolutionary genetic programming CGP approach tosynthesis composite features for target recognition. The CGP usesdomainindependent primitive operators to synthesis compositefeatures from primitive ones, which contains the knowledge about theproblem domain. Here, the two dimensional Fourier transform FT,wavelet transform WT and KarhunenLoeve transform KLT areapplied to the synthetic aperture radar SAR imagery to extractprimitive features. The motivation for using CGP is to overcome thelimitations of human experts who consider only a small number ofconventional combinations of primitive features during synthesis. CGP,on the other hand, can try a very large number of unconventionalcombinations and these ones yield exceptionally good results in somecases.An extensive experiment on the MSTAR Moving and Stationary TargetAcquisition and Recognition datasets is put into practice. To evaluatethe performance of the algorithm, the receiver operation characteristicROC curves and confusion matrices are used. The ROC curve showsthe relationship between the percentage of correct detections andpercentage of false alarms. The confusion matrix shows the number oftargets that are correctly recognized, misclassified and rejected. Theexperimental results show that CGP can discover good compositefeatures to distinguish targets belonging to several classes.656828, Session 4Preprocessing of SAR interferometric data usinganisotropic diffusion filterK. Sartor, J. D. Allen, E. Ganthier, Harris Corp. G. B. Tenali, FloridaInstitute of TechnologyThe most commonly used smoothing algorithm in complex dataprocessing is some variant of a blurring function Hanning, Taylorweighting, Gaussian, etc.  Unfortunately, these filters blur the edges ina Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR scene, reduce the accuracy offeatures, and blur the fringe lines in an interferogram.  For the DigitalElevation Model DEM extraction, the blurring of these fringe linescauses inaccuracies in the height of the unwrapped terrain surface. Ourgoal here is to perform spatially nonuniform smoothing to overcomethe above mentioned disadvantages.  This is achieved by using acomplex anisotropic nonlinear diffuser CANDI filter that is a spatiallyvarying.  In particular, an appropriate choice of the convection functionin the CANDI filter is able to accomplish the non uniform smoothing.This boundary sharpeningsmoothing filter acts on interferometric SARdata with noise to produce an interferogram with significantly reducednoise contents and desirable local smoothing.  Results of CANDIfiltering will be discussed and compared with those obtained by usingthe standard filters on simulated data.656829, Session 4A realtime robust featurebased object trackingalgorithmB. Han, D. Wu, J. Li, Univ. of FloridaObject tracking is an important component of many computer visionsystems.  It is widely used in video surveillance, robotics, 3D imagereconstruction, medical imaging, and human computer interface.   Inthis paper, we focus on unsupervised object tracking, i.e., without priorknowledge about the object to be tracked.  To address this problem, wetake a featurebased approach, i.e., using feature points or landmarkpoints to represent objects.  Featurebased object tracking consists offeature extraction and feature correspondence.   Featurecorrespondence is particularly challenging since a feature point in oneimage may have many similar points in another image, resulting inambiguity in feature correspondence.   To resolve the ambiguity,algorithms, which use exhaustive search and correlation over a largeneighborhood, have been proposed.  However, these algorithms incurhigh computational complexity, which is not suitable for realtimetracking.   In contrast, Tomasi and Kanades tracking algorithm onlysearches corresponding points in a small candidate set, whichsignificantly reduces computational complexity but the algorithm maylose track of feature points in a long image sequence.    To mitigate thelimitations of the aforementioned algorithms, this paper proposes anefficient and robust featurebased tracking algorithm.   The key idea ofour algorithm is as below.  For a given target feature point in one frame,we first find a corresponding point in the next frame, which minimizesthe sumofsquareddifference SSD between the two points then wetest whether the corresponding point gives small value under the socalled Harris criterion. If not, we further identify a candidate set offeature points in a small neighborhood of the target point then find acorresponding point from the candidate set, which minimizes the SSDbetween the two points.   The algorithm may output no correspondingpoint due to disappearance of the target point.   Our algorithm iscapable of tracking feature points and detecting occlusionsuncoveredregions.   Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance ofthe proposed algorithm over the existing methods.656830, Session 4Multinomial pattern matching for highrange resolutionprofilesM. L. Koudelka, J. A. Richards, M. W. Koch, Sandia National Labs.Airborne radar using ground moving target indication can track movingvehicles at large standoff distances. Unfortunately, trajectories frommultiple vehicles can become kinematically confused and the trackercan no longer separate the target vehicle from others. We propose theuse of high range resolution HRR profiles and multinomial patternmatching MPM for target fingerprinting and trackstitching.Sandias MPM algorithm is a robust, templatebased identificationalgorithm that has been applied successfully to various targetrecognition problems.  MPM utilizes a quantile transformation to maptarget pixels to a small number of grayscale values, or quantiles.  Thealgorithm relies on a statistical characterization of the multinomialdistribution of these pixelwise quantile values for targets of interest.The quantile transformation and statistical characterization proceduresare extremely well suited to a robust representation of targets for HRRprofiles they are invariant to sensor calibration, robust to targetsignature variations, and lend themselves to efficient matchingalgorithms.In typical HRR tracking applications, target fingerprints must be initiatedon the fly from a limited number of HRR profiles.  Data may accumulateindefinitely as vehicles are tracked, and their templates must becontinually updated without growing unbounded in size or complexity.To address this need, an incrementally updated version of MPM wasdeveloped.  This implementation of MPM incorporates individual HRRprofiles as they are available, and fuses data from multiple aspectangles for a given target to aid in trackstitching.  This paper will providean overview, algorithm details, and experimental results for theincrementally updated version of MPM.Conf. 6568 Algorithms for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery XIV290 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss656831, Session 4Sparse manifold learning applied to building syntheticaperture radar ATR templatesP. L. Busarow, N. N. Shah, D. E. Waagen, Raytheon Missile SystemsV. S. Berisha, Arizona State Univ.In realtime target recognition applications that attempt to find the bestmatch between a test sample and stored reference samples, onboardstorage and throughput limitations dictate that not all training samplescan be stored and processed. It is customary to form templates, eachof which spans some volume of training data, resulting in completecoverage of the training space with a reduced cardinality. For example,in the Synthetic Aperature Radar setting, each template can be apossibly weighted average spanning parameter bins in azimuth,elevation, range, etc. Traditionally the bin sizes have been held constantover the parameter space. For a twoclass problem using the publicrelease MSTAR dataset, we apply a Sparse Manifold Learningtechnique that admits unequal bin sizes. We measure the interclassdivergence for templates built by averaging training samples locatedwithin either equally sized or unequally sized spacefilling bins, as afunction of the number of stored templates.656832, Session 4Objectimage metric properties and applicationsD. G. Arnold, O. L. Mendoza, Air Force Research Lab.Research in the area of objectimage relations has transformed the ATRproblem into a feature extraction and correspondence problem. Thisultimately results in the problem of how to most efficiently search alarge database. In this paper, we explore the properties of the recentlyintroduced ObjectImage OI metric, which provides a metric fordetermining how close an image of an object is to the actual object. Inparticular, a number of search algorithms including exhaustive search,binary search, and other classic search algorithms are applied withinthe framework of an OI metric algorithm. The results are comparedwith previous methods which did not incorporate the OI metric. Theresults indicate the OI metric is a reasonable metric.656833, Session 4Scorebased SAR ATR performance modelsE. M. Lavely, V. Kaufman, BAE Systems Advanced InformationTechnologies T. D. Ross, E. Blasch, Air Force Research Lab.We consider principles and applications of regressionbased SAR ATRmodels for ATR outputs such as score likelihoods, summary scorestatistics and score differentials. Standard performance metrics areeasily computed from these response variables.  The covariatespredictor variables are derived from ancillary measurable operatingconditions e.g., target size and class, depression, etc. and fromsummary statistics of physicsderived scattering center propertiesused for forward image prediction. Key model estimation difficultiesinclude model selection since the functional form is unknown andvariable selection since only a subset of candidate covariates havepredictive utility.  We use a variety of Bayesian methods based onreversible jump MCMC to address these issues. ATR scores are randomvariables due to influences such as sensor noise, physical variations oftargets in the field relative to idealized theoretical models, errors inassumed sensor pose parameters, etc.  The largest discovered scorelikelihood is usually identified as the optimal target hypothesis, butconfusers or similar targets may generate scores very close to or evenlarger than the correct hypothesis score. To capture these effects weuse a Monte Carlo analysis in which birth, death and alterationprocesses are applied to the scattering centers, and forward images aresynthesized for each realization. The synthetic and observed images arethen matched to obtain likelihood scores.  There are many potentialapplications of an ATR performance model, including online sensormanagement and fusion support and offline analyses where ATRperformance may be predicted for an operational scenario.656838, Session 4Diffusion distances and radar data analysisD.

E. Gray, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. A. T. Alouani, TennesseeTechnological Univ.The Raleigh Problem Raleigh1919, Beckmann1987, Barakat1988,originally arose in Lord Raleighs investigations into scatteringacoustical waves off of rough surfaces. The problem was to evaluatethe probability density function PDF of a random sum.Transformations of this type arises in the remote sensing community ina variety of guise such as tracking of targets keep a recursive recordon objects with acoustical or electromagnetic sensors. A typicalexample of this is type of problem is found in target tracking. Targettracking in radar and sonar is done in either spherical or rectangularcoordinates. Often tracking is done in one reference framebla whilefiltering, usually Kalman, is done in another reference frame. It iscommonly assumed that the PDF can be treated the same in bothreference frames BarShalom2001 and Mo1998. An extended Kalmanfilter is used, under the assumption that the converted PDF can beadequately characterized by the mean and standard deviation.If  one treats  the ploar coordinates as   noisy measurements of a targetposition, the objective of this paper is to analytically characterize thePDF of  the measurements in cartesian coordinates and investigate theimpact of approximating the PDF using the mean and standarddeviation on the target track quality.ReferencesBarakat, R., 1988 Probability density functions of sums of sinusoidalwaves having nonuniform random phases and random numbers ofmultipath.

Gray, NavalSurface Warfare Ctr.The use of multiple sensors for state estimation can lead to betterquality estimates than when a single sensor is used. For the samenumber of resources, sensors with different data rates asynchronoussensors can provide better coverage than synchronous sensors. Thelocal estimates produced by asynchronous sensors are not timecoincident. In the presence of communication delays between sensorplatforms and fusion center and in the presence of outof sequencedata, the optimal centralized processing architecture may not befeasible in real time. Recently the authors derived a general track fusionalgorithm that fuses data from an arbitrary number of asynchronoussensors, where communication delays exist between sensors platformand data fusion center and where data may arrive out of sequence ata.Because the derivation is very general, its actual implementation is achallenge.  The objective of this paper is to derive similar fusionalgorithms using constant gain filters instead of the Kalman filter as thelocal processor.  Constant gain filters have been used in real worldtracking systems. Once the general derivation is provided, practicalassumptions will be used to simplify the new fusion algorithm andcompare it to existing synchronous constant gain filters.  The methodfor accomplishing this is to take the derivation of constant gain filterssuch as those found in BarShalom1988, Blackman1986, Gray1989,or Gray2001 to provide a simplified version of our track fusionalgorithm that takes into account more recent work that simplifies thederivation for constant gain filters and provides a comprehensive butsimplified filter Gray2004 and Gray2004a. This paper is organized asfollows. Section sets up the mechanism for the derivation of theconstant gain filter. The changes necessary to make the derivation workfor asynchronous track fusion filter of ata are discussed in Section 3.Section 4 has some discussions and conclusions.ReferencesA. T. Alouani, J. E.

S. SmithCarroll, D. H. McCabe, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.What distinguishes a superior Multiple Model tracking filter design from apoor filter design is the speed with which the switching logic detects andthen responds to a target maneuver by reshuffling the weights to matchthe new target dynamic configuration.  Most Multiple Model MM filterdesigns incorporate a Markov Switching Matrix MSM as part of theirswitching logic.  This matrix, whose values are selected in a generally adhoc manner, has a significant impact on the response time of theswitching logic to a sudden target maneuver.  No optimum methodexists for selecting values with which to populate this matrix.  A set ofvalues that may provide a good tracking performance against a specifictarget type may not yield a good performance against a different targettype.  Since one cannot know in advance what target type is going to beencountered in a given scenario, the filter designer is faced with a designdilemma.  In spite of this, the MM filter structure has won wideacceptance within the academic tracking community.Research was performed on alternative switching mechanisms formultiple model filters that do not require a MSM for their switching logic.For the Alternative Switching Logic ASL studied, evidence shows thatperformance of the ASL is comparable to that offered by the InteractingMultiple Model IMM for the six NSWCDD target trajectories.  Studiesalso indicate that the ASL, which is considerably less complex than theIMM switching logic, shows a 20 percent decrease in run time over thatof the IMM.  The results presented are an important first step ininvestigating alternative design methods for multiple model switchinglogic.  Future work should investigate other types of decision logic suchas DempsterShafer reasoning, fuzzy logic, and possibly neuralnetworks.656905, Session 1Launch point estimation and impact point prediction ofsmall ballistic munitions with an interacting multiplemodel estimatorD. F. Hardiman, U.S. Army Research, Development and EngineeringCommandThe interacting multiple model IMM estimator, which mixes and blendsresults of multiple filters according to their mode probabilities, isfrequently used to track targets whose motion is not wellcaptured by asingle model.  This paper extends the use of an IMM estimator tocomputing launch point estimates LPEs and impact point predictionsIPPs of small ballistic munitions whose motion models change whenthey reach supersonic speeds.  Three approaches for computing LPEsand IPPs are compared.  The first approach propagates only the trackfrom the most likely mode until it impacts the ground.  Since thisapproach neglects inputs from the other modes, it is not desirable ifmultiple modes have nearequal probabilities.  The second approach forcomputing LPEs and IPPs propagates tracks from each model containedin the IMM estimator to the ground independent of each other andcombines the resulting state estimates and covariances on the groundvia a weighted sum in which weights are the model probabilities.  Thethird approach is designed to take advantage of the computationalsavings of the first without sacrificing input from any of the IMMs modes.It fuses the tracks from the models together and propagates the fusedtrack to the ground.  Note that the second and third approaches reduceto the first if one of the modes has a probability of one.  Results from allthree approaches are compared in a highfidelity radar simulation.656907, Session 2Acquisition, tracking, and pointing technologydevelopment for bifocal relay mirror spacecraftJ. J. Kim, T. A. Sands, B. N. Agrawal, Naval Postgraduate SchoolThe purpose of the paper is to develop acquisition, tracking, and pointingtechnologies for the Bifocal Relay Mirror Spacecraft and verify thesetechnologies with the experimental test bed. The Bifocal Relay MirrorSpacecraft utilizes two optically coupled telescopes to redirect a laserfrom the ground, aircraft or spacecraft laser source to distant points onthe earth or in space. Because of the stringent accuracy requirement ofthe laser beam, significant research is needed to develop acquisition,tracking, and pointing technologies for the Bifocal Relay MirrorSpacecraft.In this paper, attitude control methods for the Bifocal Relay MirrorSpacecraft are developed.

Furthermore the type of mission profiles towhich large gimbals are subjected have received limited attention in thisfield of research, so the selection of an appropriate friction model is notobvious.

Chen, L. Zhang, Changchun Institute of Optics, Fine Mechanicsand Physics China1.IntroductionTwoaxis optoelectronic tracking equipments generally use such modethat azimuth and pitch system are independently controlled. It leads tothe two structures completely uncoupled, and reduces the state spacedimension. But the main problem is that the rotational inertia of azimuthis much larger than that of pitch, so to find a more suitable mechanicsand more effective control strategy is necessary, for enhancing trackingperformance of the optoelectronic system. Considering the trackingability, it is possible to uniformly correct the error of both the azimuthand pitch system in real time, and obtain a better control algorithm toboth systems. It is realized by cross coupling control to the azimuth andpitch, with two inputs to ensure the same dimensions in the space.2.Bandwidth Mutual Benefit and Precision Mutual CompensationTwo independent SISO systems azimuth and pitch are cross coupledinto one system, which is called as a MIMO system.

IntroductionWhen an optoelectronic system tracks a fast moving target, theovertune is the main part of the dynamic tracking error. The speed delaycompensation may be used to decrease the error but the stability issacrificed. We put forward the positionleading compensation to checkthe overtune, and the tracking precision is improved greatly.2. The positionleading compensationWe choose a sample transfer function as the positionleadingcompensation section GpsKp STpS1 . Because the differentialmay introduce the noise to the system, it may be changed to a suitableform.  The system with the positionleading compensation is shown inFig.1. Fig.1 The principle system diagram with positionleadingcompensationKp determines the ability to check the overtune, while Tp  the frequencyrange.The system openloop gain has a resonant peak just lower thecrossing frequency with the positionleading compensation. Throughthe system identification, we may explain it with the Robust Controllerwhich is based on the internal principle.3. The simulationsThe system with positionleading compensation shown in MatlabSimulink is shown in Fig.2. The system includes the CCD tracker andprediction, a dynamic hightype controller, the position correction, thespeed correction and object. When the input is the equalized sine withthe accelerate 120s2, the speed 120s, the tracking precision is0.6which is shown in Fig.3.Fig. 2   The simulating diagram with positionleading compensationFig.3   120sin1t  tracking error4. ConclusionThe positionleading compensation can improve the tracking ability forthe fast moving target, but may deteriorate the tracking precision at lowfrequency range. So that, it may be used together with the dynamichightype control. Our experiments are carried out now.656912, Session 3Tunable wavelet target extraction preprocessorD. Yonovitz, Complex Data SystemsThe key measurements of PointingTracking system performance arethe abilities to correctly acquire targets and to maintain low track errorthe error associated with stabilizing the target in the image scene.Good target acquisition and track performance is readily attainableunder nominal conditions, i.e. targets of high Signal to Noise RatioSNR relative to clutter within the image, or targets that have easilydiscernable relative motion with respect to other possible targets orclutter. It is in the absence of these favorable conditions when a TrackPreprocessor is highly advantageous or even necessary to meetperformance requirements e.g. a relatively small, stationary or slowmoving, distant target within a field of view with considerablebackground. This is the thrust of the Tunable Wavelet Target ExtractionPreprocessor TWTEP.The TWTEP enhances the video signal prior to the Track ProcessFunction. The Track Process Function may be of any type correlation,centroid, edge,  that utilizes a video image signal as input. The outputof the TWTEP is either a high SNR image, or a target coordinate. Theoutput image may be of processed input video or synthesized videosuitable for a Track Process Function. In a typical system engineeredconfiguration, the Track Process Function is left unaltered toaccomplish its unobstructed design functionality while scenariodependent processing is accomplished in the TWTEP where therequired flexibility is readily achievable.Different stressful scenarios require that the video be enhanced indifferent ways to meet overall performance requirements. The TWTEP iscapable of meeting this demand by tuning the video enhancement indifferent ways appropriate to meet the varied and critical requirementsof differing scenarios. This objective is performed in Wavelet Transformspace. The tuning of the video refers to algorithms that manipulatefilter the video, in Wavelet space, to either enhance the target andornegate the background clutter video parameters. Tunable filterparameters are calculated to optimize the contributions of individualWavelet bands in both horizontal and vertical directions to a video sum.This process continues over contiguous video images and quicklyconverges to filter the targets video parameters for enhancement andnegation of background. This tuning process is accomplished as quickas the video frame rate or at a rate necessary to meet the dynamics ofthe video scene.A key algorithmic element is the processing to determine a target regionwithin the image, referred to as Target DefinitionExtraction. Possibletarget regions are determined by a PseudoCovariance method. Thismethod defines regions of interest within the video based upon acovariance between Wavelet Subbands. It then makes a determinationof the target region and uses the sensor or simulated video for output tothe Track Process Function. This processing eliminates noise and pixelsthat are not considered significant.The functionality of the TWTEP is composed of Sensor InputProcessing, Wavelet Transform Processing, Wavelet SubBandProcessing, PseudoCovariance Processing, Target DefinitionExtraction Processing, Video Output Processing, and ControlStatusProcessing.The algorithms performed by the TWTEP encompass the objectives oftarget enhancement, background noise reduction, clutter reductionrejection. high SNR output, and object feature determination. Itaccomplishes these objectives in an algorithm environment thatincludes memoryless independent determination output is notdependent upon previous images, is scalable to multispectral sensors,can be configured in a closed loop target definition, and may beimplemented in an automated netcentric or standalone imageexploitation configuration. These objectives are accomplished withoutthe need for gating a target and the target may be of arbitrary shapeand size.Based upon an understanding that valid targets exhibit filterableidentifiable characteristics in different Wavelet SubBands, and that priori target characteristic knowledge andor, a pixel covariance ofWavelet SubBands is a valid measure of significant information, theTWTEP can improve the probability of correct target acquisition andlower track error.656913, Session 3Target tracking based on spatiotemporal fractal errorB.

Theoutputs of both the spatial and the temporal fractal error componentsare combined and presented as input to a kinematic tracking filter.  It isshown that combining the outputs allows for improved trackingperformance in the presence of noise, occlusion, and other movingobjects.  Furthermore, reconciliation of the spatial and temporalcomponents also provides a useful mechanism for detecting andavoiding template drift, a problem that is typically present in correlationConf. 6569 Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing, and Laser SystemsTechnologies XXI294 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssbased trackers.

G. Fitzpatrick, Y. Wang, Tempest Technologies LLCWe present a novel methodology based on the Bayesian framework ofstatistical modeling and data analysis for the optical tracking of activelyilluminated extended targets through turbulent atmosphere.The Bayesian segmentation algorithm models the observed imagery asbeing noisy measurements of an underlying known image.  Themeasurement distribution is a probability distribution on the intensityvalue of each pixel.  In the simplest implementation, measurement isconditioned on whether or not that pixel is a target pixel or,alternatively, a background pixel.  This segmentation is initialized with aprior distribution for each pixel, having two complementary probabilityvalues for the target and the background classification.  The Bayesianmodel keeps up with the probability of each pixel being a target orbackground pixel conditioned on the observations, through the Bayesrule iteration.  Since the turbulence is dynamic, the modeling requires apredictor step of forward modeling, so that the posterior distributiondetermined from the current frame can be used appropriately as thesubsequent frames prior. The primary purpose of this model is toconstruct an enhanced image from which a high quality track signal canbe extracted.The algorithm is tested on experimental and simulated data and showsimprovement of 10 to 50 depending on turbulence strength overthe standard tracking algorithm.  This algorithm can be efficientlyimplemented even on desktop workstations we have obtained framerates of 4950 frames per second on 2Ghz Pentium machines, withframes of 128x128 pixels.656916, Session 3A novel segmentation method for object tracking andrecognitionC. Witte, W. Armbruster, M. Hebel, K. Jger, Forschungsfesellschaftfr Angewandte Naturwissenschaften e.V. GermanyThe increasing demand for the protection of persons and facilitiesrequires the application of sophisticated technologies for surveillanceand object tracking. For this purpose appropriate sensors are used likeimaging IR sensors suitable for daynight operation and laser radarsupplying 3D information of the scenario. In this context there is arequirement of automatic and semiautomatic methods supporting thehuman observer in his decisionmaking process. A prevalent task isautomatic tracking of striking objects like vehicles or individual personsin an image sequence during a time slice. Classical methods are basedon template matching implying certain shortcomings concerninghomogeneous background or passing objects occluding the targetobject. We propose a new concept of generating templates for IR targetsignatures based on the interpretation of laser range data to optimizethe tracking process. Our test bed is realized by a helicopter equippedwith a multisensor suite laser radar, imaging IR, GPS, IMU. The laserscanner itself is an 1.5 m erbium fiber system, derived from the EADSHELLAS family, that covers a fieldofview of 14.4 degrees in horizontaland vertical direction with a resolution of 128x128 pixels and a scanrate of about 4 Hz. The infrared images are taken with an AIM 810 mFPA sensor 640x480 pixels and a slightly wider fieldofview whichoverlaps that of the laser.Results are demonstrated by the analysis of an exemplary data set. Avehicle situated in a complex scenario is acquired by a forward movingsensor platform and tracked robustly by the proposed method.656917, Session 3Video surveillance of pedestrians and vehiclesM. S. Snorrason, D. Gutchess, Charles River Analytics, Inc. V.Ablavsky, Boston Univ. and Charles River Analytics, Inc. A.Thangali, S. Sclaroff, Boston Univ.In this paper, we focus on the problem of automated surveillance in aparking lot scenario. We call our research system VANESSA, for VideoAnalysis for Nighttime Surveillance and Situational Awareness.VANESSA is capable of 1 detecting moving objects via backgroundmodeling and false motion suppression, 2 tracking and classifyingpedestrians and vehicles, 3 detecting events such as person enteringor exiting a vehicle, and 4 recognizing vehicles across space and time.Moving object detection utilizes a multistage cascading approach toidentify pixels that belong to the true objects and reject any spuriousmotion, e.g., due to vehicle headlights or moving foliage. Pedestriansand vehicles are tracked using a multiple hypothesis tracker coupledwith a particle filter for state estimation and prediction. The spacetimetrajectory of each tracked object is stored in an SQL database alongwith sample imagery to support video forensics applications. Thedetection of pedestrians enteringexiting vehicles is accomplished byfirst estimating the threedimensional pose and the corresponding entryand exit points of each tracked vehicle in the scene. A pedestrianactivity model is then used to probabilistically assign pedestrian tracksthat appear or disappear in the vicinity of these entryexit points. Avehicle classification module is used to identify vehicles acrossarbitrarily long time periods. Histogram of Oriented Gradients, or HoGfeatures, are extracted from image chips belonging to vehicles andstored in the database. A cover tree index is constructed over all theHoG feature vectors in the database to perform efficient matching. Weevaluate the performance of motion detection and tracking modules onan extensive data set collected in a challenging realworld scenario.656918, Session 3Zoom techniques for achieving scale invariant objecttracking in realtime active vision systemsE. D. Nelson, J. C. Cockburn, Rochester Institute of TechnologyIn a surveillance system, a camera operator follows an object of interestby moving the camera, then gains additional information about theobject by zooming. As the active vision field advances, the ability toautomate such a system is nearing fruition. One hurdle limiting the useof object recognition algorithms in realtime systems is the quality ofcaptured imagery recognition algorithms often have strict scale andposition requirements where if those parameters are not met, theperformance rapidly degrades to failure. The ability of an automaticfixation system to capture quality video of an accelerating target isdirectly related to the response time of the mechanical pan, tilt, andzoom platformhowever the price of such a platform rises with itsperformance. The goal of this work is to create a system that providesscaleinvariant tracking using inexpensive offtheshelf components.Since optical zoom acts as a measurement gain, amplifying bothresolution and tracking error, a new second camera with fixed focallength assists the zooming camera if it loses fixationeffectivelyclipping error. Furthermore, digital zoom adjusts the captured image toensure position and scale invariance for the higherlevel application.The implemented system uses two Sony EVID100 cameras on a2.8GHz Dual Pentium Xeon PC. This work presents experiments toexhibit the effectiveness of the system.656919, Session 3Passive ranging of boostphase missilesM. Hawks, G. P. Perram, Air Force Institute of TechnologyThe depth of absorption bands in observed spectra of distant, brightsources can be used to estimate range to the source.  Previous effortsin this area have relied on measuring infrared CO2 bands, withdisappointing results.  A novel approach has been developed that usesobservations of the O2 absorption band near 762 nm.  This band wasselected because it is spectrally isolated from other atmospheric bands,Conf. 6569 Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing, and Laser SystemsTechnologies XXI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 295and O2 levels in the atmosphere are easily predicted from simplemeteorology data.  Range is estimated by comparing observed valuesof bandaverage absorption, A , against predicted curves derived fromeither historical data or model predictions.  Accuracy of better than0.5 has been verified in shortrange up to 3km experiments, andmodels are used to predict results at longer ranges.  A notional passivesensor to augment the active ranging sensor on the ABL system is usedto guide parameter selection for this analysis.  Range accuracy of 5 ispredicted for ranges up to 400 km in this scenario.  Performance can bemuch better at shorter ranges or at night.656920, Session 3Results from precision tracking tests against distantobjectsJ. F. Riker, Air Force Research Lab.No abstract available656921, Session 3Optimization of the tomographic scanning TOSCAimagerH. Hovland, Forsvarets Forsknings Institute NorwayThe tomographic scanning TOSCA imager was invented by the authorin 2003. Initially, the system was based on reconstructing an image fromthe signal of a simple single pixel, conical scan FMreticle sensor usingtomographic techniques. Although the system has been used forseveral decades for realtime tracking purposes, the imaging propertiesof the single pixel conical scan reticle system was left undiscovereduntil recently, although multitarget discrimination was demonstratedwith multispectral versions of the system. The initial system presentedby the author demonstrated the ability to discriminate between multiplespots in the field of view in a fairly simple scenario. Advances havebeen made in both theory and technology, mainly with the introductionof the nutating circular aperture in the scanning optics, and the use ofFourier transform ramp filters during reconstruction, and TOSCA is inprinciple found to be a perfect imaging system, only limited by practicalaspects such as the number of angular scans, the spatial sampling,noise and vibration. The simplicity of the hardware, together with therapid advances in high performance, low cost computing means thesystem has a potential for lowcost applications such as in expendablemultispectral thermal imagers.This paper will present the current state of the technology, includingimprovements in algorithms and reticle shapes, and look at artifactsfound in various images due to different geometries, as well as ways tohandle these artifacts. Several noise generating processes and theireffects will be presented and illustrated with results from digitalsimulations. Requirements for image processing in terms of computingpower are investigated, together with the potential for parallelization.656923, Session 4Angel Fire a realtime opensource video trackingsystemB. R. Secrest, J. R. Vasquez, Air Force Institute of TechnologyAngel Fire can be used in either military operations or homelanddefense. Multiple cameras are mounted on an airplane that flies in acircle and point to a central location. The images are preregistered anda single large image is sent to a ground station at the rate of a frame persecond. Although realtime human surveillance of the video providesuseful benefit, it is desired to have realtime automatic target tracking toaid the observer. The first step needed for tracking is measurements.The video undergoes additional registration and processing to producetwoframe motion detections. These measurements are passed to thetracking algorithm. Due to the precise nature of the measurements, weavoid the traditional challenge of clutter, however tracking through anurban environment has its own unique challenges. Targets frequentlycross paths, go behind one another, and go behind buildings or intoshadowed areas where no measurements can be generated.Additional challenges include MoveStopMove, parallax, and trackassociation with highly similar targets. All of these challenges need tobe overcome with a thousand moving vehicles, so processing speed iscrucial. The project is OpenSource to aid in overcoming thesetechnical challenges. Alternative trackers IMM, MHT, features,association methods, trackinitiation and deletion MN or LU, statevariables, or other specialized routines for MoveStopMove, parallax,etc. will be tried and analyzed with representative data. By keeping itOpenSource, any ideas to improve the system can be easilyimplemented and analyzed. This paper presents current findings andstate of the project.656925, Session 4Comprehensive evaluation of tracking systems by nonphotorealistic simulationC. Dubreu, Cedip Infrared Systems France A. Manzanera, coleNationale Suprieure de Techniques Avances France E. Bohain,Cedip Infrared Systems FranceAs more and more research effort is drawn into object trackingalgorithms, the ability to assess the performance of these algorithmsquantitatively has become a fundamental issue in computer vision.Because tracking systems have to operate in widely varying conditionsdifferent weather conditions, background and target characteristics,etc, a large test bed of video sequences is needed in order to obtain acomprehensive evaluation of a tracker across the whole range of itsoperating conditions. However, it is very unlikely that a dataset of realvideo sequences representative of the whole range of operatingconditions of a tracker together with its ground truth could be obtained,and building a realistic synthetic dataset of such sequences wouldrequire costly advanced simulation platforms.In the new evaluation method proposed in this paper, the operationalcriteria of the tracking system are turned into objective measures andused to generate a pseudosynthetic dataset, nonphotorealistic, butstatistically representative of the whole range of operating conditions.The assessment of an algorithm using our method provides both aquantitative evaluation of the algorithm and the borders of its validitydomain. The performance measurement of an algorithm on a pseudosynthetic sequence is shown to be consistent with the measurement ona real sequence with the same criteria. The benefit of this approach istwofold it provides the developer with a way to concentrate on theweaknesses of his algorithm, and helps the system designer to choosethe algorithm that best fits the operating constraints.656926, Session 4A method for tuning a standard Linux kernel to be usedin signal processing systemsR. Herbel, Raytheon Co.There is a desire to be able to use the Linux operating system in realtime applications for sensors and also for a test bed for these system.Normally, there is some acceptable time  system spec between thehardware interrupt and the time the operating system enters theinterrupt handler. If the time is longer than the system spec we can missinterrupts and miss data or we can fail to perform some critical controlfunction in the system. There is also a very large number of places inthe Linux kernel where interrupts are blocked. The majority of theseinvolve device drivers which are not part of your system and are notused. This involves a finding a needle in the haystack problem. Industryhas tried to solve this. One approach is to try to write a microkernelunder Linux to handle interrupts. This is used by RTAI and RTLinux. Inthis approach Linux does not handle the interrupts but is passed downfrom the micro OS. The other approach is to try to make Linux morepreemptable ie reduce the latency. This is used by several companiesTimesys, Montavista etc. This paper presents a new approach whichincludes an investigation technique to determine what interrupt blockingcalls in the Linux kernel are causing the system to fail the interruptlatency requirements of the system. The paper also shows severaltechniques once those areas are identified to modify the kernel to meetthe interrupt latency requirements of the system.Conf. 6569 Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing, and Laser SystemsTechnologies XXI296 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssThe first step of the technique is to identify the areas of the Linux kernelwhich are causing the interrupt latency issues. Blocking interrupt calls inthe Linux kernel are architecture dependent  they are different forpower pc, Intel, etc  . However, the actual interrupt blocking call isnormally in one place in the Linux kernel. This enabled us to add somecode to take a time measurement when the operating system blockedinterrupts and another one when the operating system unblockedinterrupts. We then compared the measured interrupt latency to oursystem requirements and stored the areas which did not meet oursystem requirements. We also captured the memory location of thecalling function so we can then use the Linux memory map to find theoffending area of the Linux kernel. We made this information availablethrough the proc area of the Linux kernel. We now have list offendingarea of the Linux kernel which needs to be tuned to meet our interruptlatency requirements.In addition, There is some benefit that this list may grow our shrinkdepending on the interrupt latency requirements.The next step is to modify those areas to eliminate the interrupt latency.In our project, we had three main areas of improvement. The first areawas to get rid of unneeded functionality of the Linux kernel. We foundan area in SELinux was causing some of our interrupt latency issues.We did not need this functionality so we simply recompiled our kernelremoving this feature. The second was to change a lazy kernel driverwriter. He was writing a device driver where he did not need to block allinterrupts but he did it anyways. We modified this device driver to onlyblock his interrupt and not all. This caused our critical data collectioninterrupt not to be blocked. The next area we had to modify was in thegeneric Ethernet system of the Linux kernel. This area is a little moreinteresting because the kernel writer needed to block all interruptsbecause he was doing some critical list manipulation and didnt wantshis hardware device adding our subtracting from the list. As he waswriting a generic network subsystem, he had no idea what hardwareinterrupt the network subsystem was associated with. In our project, wehad some preknowledge of what interrupts our network device wereassociated with. So, we changed the blocking calls to just block onlythe network interrupts and not our critical data collection interrupt.Using these techniques, We successfully modified a standard Linuxkernel to meet the interrupt latency requirements of our subsystem.656927, Session 4IRLooK an advanced mobile infrared signaturemeasurement, data reduction, and analysis systemT. Cukur, Y. Altug, C. Uzunoglu, ASELSAN Inc. TurkeyDuring the development of countermeasures against infrared threats, itis extremely important to develop high quality infrared signaturedatabases of targets that are intended to be protected from thesethreats. IRLook is a mobile surfacetoair infrared signaturemeasurement system, which is developed to perform infrared signaturemeasurements of infrared countermeasures military and civil platformssuch as fixedrotary wing aircrafts, trackedwheeled vehicles and navyvessels in the field.

The system provides detailed information on the radiantintensities, spectral and spatial characteristics of the targets and thecountermeasures.Both of automatic and manual modes of tracking of target are availableby its high quality field proven twoaxes tracking mount. The tracking isaccomplished by using a passive imaging tracker during day and nighttime operations. The system also includes a high quality meteorologicalstation and field calibration equipment such as cavity and extendedarea blackbodies.656928, Session 4Practical to tactical an evolution of the dual lineofsightexperimentD. J. Riedle, BoeingSVS, Inc.In early 2001 BoeingSVS began an Internal Research and DevelopmentIRAD project, dubbed the Dual Line of Sight DLOS experiment, toperform riskreduction on the development of the control systems andmode logic for a strategic laser relay mirror system.  The DLOSexperiment uses primarily Commercial OfftheShelf COTS hardwareand realtime system software, plus internallydesigned gimbals andflexible mode logic tools to emulate a scalable relay mirror engagement.The highlevel, nominal engagement sequence begins with the lasersource gimbal establishing a line of sight with the relay receiver gimbalby closing passive acquisition and finetracking loops.  Simultaneously,the receiver gimbal closes passive acquisition and finetracking loopson the laser source, and a lowpower 660 nm alignment laser ispropagated through the system.  Finally, the transmitter gimbal closespassive acquisition and finetrack loops on a target, and the systempropagates a simulated highenergy laser on that line of sight ontotarget models.  In total, the DLOS experiment closes 28 control loops.For the strategic scenario, a model rocket target is illuminated with alightemitting diode, and tracked by the BoeingSVS AdvancedReconfigurable Trackers, using a centroid algorithm.  The strategicscenario also uses a 532 nm laser to close an active track loop using aLinux tracker.  To better align with our business capture strategy, theemphasis of the experiment in 2005 has shifted to emulating an urbantactical engagement, and developing weapon system operatorconsoles.656929, Session 5Adaptive filtering and feedforward control forsuppression of vibration and jitterE. H. Anderson, R. Blankinship, L. P. Fowler, R. Glaese, P. Janzen,CSA Engineering, Inc.This paper describes the use of adaptive filtering to reduce vibrationand optical jitter.  Adaptive filtering refers to a class of signal processingtechniques developed over the last 30 years, and applied since toapplications ranging from communications to image processing.  Thepaper applies adaptive filtering methods to feedforward control ofstructures and systems including precision optical assemblies.  Theauthors have fielded several feedforward control systems, andmeasured performance will support concepts and methods presentedin the paper.Active vibration control has have most often been realized via feedbackcontrol, and jitter control for optical systems generally uses feedbackservo architectures.  Such realizations make use of actuators, errorsensors, control system hardware and software, and a variety of controlarchitectures and algorithms.  While feedback designs often incorporateinformation about system disturbance inputs, for example through theuse of weighting filters in H2optimal designs, they are generally notconfigured to process and adapt to changing disturbances in real time.Adaptive filtering methods, beginning with techniques such as the leastmean squares LMS algorithm, have been successful and are usedwidely in signal processing applications.  The extension to processingof measured vibration signals has been demonstrated over the last twodecades.  Recent advances in digital signal processors DSPs andother digital hardware have made realtime adaptive filtering feasible fora broader range of vibration control applications including optical jittercontrol.The paper will review basic concepts in adaptive filtering andfeedforward control, including the relationship between andsimultaneous implementation of feedback and feedforward algorithms.A series of examples in vibration, motion and jitter control will illustratethe effectiveness of the adaptive methods.  These applications makeuse of information and signals that originate from system disturbancesand minimize the correlations between disturbance information andperformance and error measures.  The examples will illustrate a varietyof disturbance types including periodic, multitonal, broadbandstationary and nonstationary.  Control effectiveness with slowlyvaryingConf. 6569 Acquisition, Tracking, Pointing, and Laser SystemsTechnologies XXI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 297narrowband disturbances can be extraordinary, reaching 60 dB ofreduction or rejection.  In other cases, performance improvements maybe only 30, but such reductions are significant in many applications.The paper will provide realistic performance expectations for differentdisturbance types and physical systems.  Physical systems to bediscussed include vehicle interiors, groundbased active optics systems,flight motion simulators, wind turbines and airborne optical beam controlsystems.Adaptive filtering applied to feedforward control is a powerful addition toservo and feedback control methods.  The paper will conclude byhighlighting areas with future potential and will describe themathematical, computational, and physical challenges that must be met.656930, Session 5Realtime optimal sensing strategies for active control ofoptical systemsS. Moon, Adaptive Technologies, Inc. L. P. Fowler, CSA Engineering,Inc. R. L. Clark, Jr., Duke Univ. E. H. Anderson, CSA Engineering,Inc.The pointing and imaging performance of precision optical systems isdegraded by disturbances on the system that create optical jitter. Thesedisturbances can be caused by structural motion of optical componentsdue to vibration sources that 1 originate within the optical system, 2originate external to the system and are transmitted through thestructural path in the environment, and 3 are airinduced vibrations fromacoustic noise. Beam control systems can suppress optical jitter, andactive control techniques can be used to extend performance byincorporating information from accelerometers, microphones, and otherauxiliary sensors. In some applications, offline fixed gain controllers canbe used to minimize jitter. However there are many applications in whicha realtime adaptive control approach would yield improved opticalperformance. Often we would like the capability to adapt in realtime to asystem which is timevarying or whose disturbances are nonstationaryand hard to predict. In the presence of these harsh, everchangingenvironments we would like to use every available tool to optimizeperformance. Improvements in control algorithms are important, butanother potentially useful tool is a realtime adaptive control methodemploying optimal sensing strategies. In this approach, realtimeupdating of reference sensors is provided to minimize optical jitter. Thetechnique selects an optimal subset of sensors to use as referencesfrom an array of possible sensor locations. The optimal, weightedreference sensor set is wellcorrelated with the disturbance and whenused with an adaptive control algorithm, results in improved lineofsightjitter performance with less computational burden compared to acontroller which uses multiple reference sensors. The proposedtechnique is applied to an experimental test bed in which multiple proofmass actuators generate structural vibrations on a flexible plate. Thesevibrations are transmitted to an optical mirror mounted on the plate,resulting in optical jitter as measured by a position sensing detector.Accelerometers mounted on the plate are used to form the set ofpossible optimal reference sensors. Reduction of the structural vibrationof optical components is attained using a fast steering mirror whichresults in a reduction of the corresponding jitter. Experiments werecompleted in the spring of 2006.656931, Session 5Jitter control in actively illuminated laser trackingY. Wang, L. Liu, B. G. Fitzpatrick, Tempest Technologies LLCActively illuminated laser systems operating through turbulentatmosphere suffer from performance limitations and reductions from avariety of sources. Atmospheric jitter, platform jitter, misalignments, andsignaltonoise problems are just a few of the error sources in systemperformance of optical systems. In this paper, we present studies for theuse of adaptive least squares controllers to mitigate the impact of localloop jitter on optical systems.  All of the sensing and control is of anoptical nature  no accelerometer or active vibration control is needed.The jitter control is an augmentation of the track loop controller, adding asignal to cancel the effects of the platform disturbance.  We demonstratethat one additional optical sensor can be integrating into the trackingcontrol loop to eliminate platform jitter with the tracking steering mirror.By this statement we mean that we can recover at least 95 of theidealized strehl, which is computed with no platform jitter. We havestudied the problem of platform jitter for the AirBorne Laser ABL system,using a simulation tool called WaveTrain, developed by MZA Associatesfor the study of optical control systems operating in atmosphericturbulence. When simulating platform jitter without additional control,platform jitter reduced Strehls by more than 50.  The algorithm weemploy is a recursive least squares estimation technique, which works ina manner similar to active noise cancellation methods.  The recursiveleast squares algorithm adaptively constructs an estimate of the jittersignal to remove this noise from the track loop.  The techniquesdescribed herein have also been tested in optical bench experiments andrelay mirror simulations with very promising performance.656932, Session 5Realtime, lowlatency stabilization for microautonomousunmanned vehiclesS. D. Martinez, Honeywell, Inc.Recent advances in small air and groundbased autonomous roboticplatforms equipped with electrooptical and infrared cameras havedemonstrated the utility of video data to enable missions such as IEDdetection and border and port surveillance. Many current UnmannedVehicle Systems UVS also support gimbaled sensors allowing significantflexibility in video stabilization and tracking while moving.Unfortunately, many stabilization systems are heavier and bulkier thandesired for the very small vehicles envisioned for the future. These newplatforms are extremely weight, size and power constrained, forcing eachsensing and processing system to do double and triple duty wherepossible. Current offtheshelf stabilization systems do not support thislevel of integration and many do not control video latency and throughputsufficiently to support real time UVS control requirements.To satisfy this need, an approach involving a combination of smaller, butless capable mechanical stabilization  tracking, in combination withelectronic stabilization purposely designed for these applications iswarranted. Using this approach, suppression of parasitic vehicle motionduring arbitrary but measurable maneuvers while allowing intentionalplatform motion provides an integrated solution satisfying overall systemlevel performance goals. This paper summarizes the real time videostabilization requirements for such an integrated system, developscandidate stabilization algorithmic and hardware approaches for theunderlying functions, presents comparisons and provides descriptions ofa mapping to custom real time hardware environments. Synthetic andrepresentative real data sets are used to evaluate algorithm performanceand hardware mapping efficiency.656933, Session 5Vibration evaluation of a precision inertial reference unitP. H. Merritt, J. Friel, B. Spanbauer, Air Force Research Lab. J.Donaldson, R. E. Walter, BoeingSVS, Inc.Inertial Reference Units IRUs are the basic reference for a precisionpointing system.  These units must provide a very stable inertial lightsource to be used as the reference to align the outgoing laser beam andto reject beam train jitter due to vibrations.  The IRU will be subjected tosix degree of freedom motion at its mounting location, usually very closeto the primary mirror.  The correct operation of an IRU requires it tomeasure the angular motion and not be affected by the linear inputvibration. Testing of these units is a difficult problem since the vibrationinput motion may be perfectly correlated between the angular inputs andthe linear inputs.  This correlation makes it impossible to separate theangular and linear IRU responses during a test, even with perfectmeasurements of the input vibrations.  The solution to this problem is toobtain a vibration test station that can provide linear motion without anyangular motion, and angular motion without linear motion.  The CentralInertial Guidance Test Facility CIGTF at Holloman AFB, NM hasdeveloped a vibration table that can provide this test requirement.  Recenttesting of the linear vibration system indicates that the vibration tablewhen inputting 0.2 gs linear vibration only moves 300 nanoradians inpitch and 6 nanoradians in yaw.

C. Herrick, V. M. Beazel, Air Force Research Lab. S. Gibson, P.Orzechowski, Univ. of CaliforniaLos Angeles M. Mahajan, B. Wen,Teledyne Scientific Co.Optical line of sight stability of an HEL weapon is maintained byemploying a high bandwidth jitter control system. This controller needs aclean measure of beam train line of sight jitter. This is usuallyaccomplished by inserting a stabilized laser beam that passes over mostmirrors in the optical train. The stabilization of this beam is accomplishedby mounting a small fiber fed collimator on an inertially stabilizedplatform. Functionally these devices look a bit like a fast steering mirrorwith gyros and optics attached to the mirror surface. For tacticalsystems which have small apertures, packaging becomes critical andallowable jitter levels are relatively large. For this case a compactapproach is proposed where no mechanical stabilization is attempted. Atransmissve liquid crystal beam dithering device is mounted in front ofthe collimator. The rotational motion of the collimator is measured andfed forward to a beam dithering device to stabilize the emergingalignment beam. This approach is enabled by calibrating the feedforward filter using adaptive techniques. This presentation describes theliquid crystal beam dithering device, the adaptive feedforward filteringand laboratory experiments which assess the performance limits of suchan approach.656906, Poster SessionCollaborative multimodel RaoBlackwellised particle filterfor target tracking in acoustic sensor networksZ. Yu, J. Wei, J. Zhao, H. Liu, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem andInformation Technology ChinaAn energyaware, collaborative target tracking algorithm is proposed foradhoc wireless sensor networks.  At every time step, currentmeasurements from four sensors are chosen for target motion estimationand prediction.  The algorithm is implemented distributively by passingsensing and computation operations from a subset of sensors to another.A robust multimodel RaoBlackwellised particle filter algorithm ispresented for tracking high maneuvering ground target in the sensor field.Not only is the proposed algorithm more computation efficient thangeneric particle filter for highdimension nonlinear and nonGaussianestimation problems, but also it can tackle the targets maneuverperfectly by stratified particles sampling from a set of system models.  Inthe simulation comparison, a high maneuvering target moves through anacoustic sensor network field.  The target is tracked by both generic PFand the multimodel RBPF algorithms.  The results show that ourapproach has great performance improvements, especially when thetarget is making maneuver.656922, Poster SessionIR and CCDbased object tracking using active shapemodelJ. Lee, Samsung Thales Ltd. South KoreaHeterogeneous camera based surveillance systems provide us with amore robust tracking of objects. To take advantage of additionalcameras, it is necessary to establish geometrical relationship betweenthe cameras and relationship between an object and a camera.This paper presents an algorithm that can track a nonrigid objects inrealtime in the night watch system which does not contain sufficientlight.The proposed method adopted hierarchical active shape modelASM forrealtime tracking and adaptive landmark point assignment for reducingcomputational load at each level.Active Shape Model trains contour information of an object usinglandmark points.Active Shape Model is robust for tracking nonrigid objects andovercomes the occlusion, because it changes an average shape of anobject with trained contour information of an object.Therefore Active Shape Model can extract an contour of an object in animage with much noise.Active Shape Algorithm can be divided into 4 steps.v Assigned landmark point on the contour of the object.vi Principal component analysisvii Model fittingviii Modeling a local structureThis proposed tracking algorithm uses the information from CCD sensorfor tracking objects in the day time, and uses the information form IRsensor for tracking objects in the night time.When the perfect occlusion occurs, the proposed algorithm predictsmovements of an object using the historical tracking information and itcan keep the object tracking.Through the results of this experiment, we found out that we can track anobject both day and night with an trained contour information of anobject, and confirm that robust tracking can be done in a perfect and apart occlusion.Therefore, the proposed algorithm we will develop a realtime regionalignment algorithm for a heterogeneous camerabased surveillancesystem under a complex environment.656935, Poster SessionLaserbeam director system monitoring the alignmentstate with a null reflectorY. Kim, H. Kim, Y. Park, E. Kang, Agency for Defense DevelopmentSouth Korea S. Lee, J. Kim, H. Eom, Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd.South KoreaThe Laser Beam Director consists of two mirror telescope and severalrelay mirrors. It has a long optical coude path. So, small  structuraldeformations by operational disturbances or rotational jitter of the turretcan greatly deviate the direction of the laser beam. These effects must bemonitored and corrected. We do this using a null reflector and a positionsensor. Main laser beam is transmitted to the target after reflected off thesecondary and  primary mirror sequentially. While, monitoring laser beamreturns along the same path after reflected off the annular and primarymirror because both mirrors consist of null optics. The annular mirror isattached just outside the aperture of the secondary mirror. Themonitoring HeNe laser beam, which is made annular by two axiconlenses, is collimated and sized to fit the aperture of the annular mirror.The return beam is sensed by quaddetector and gives information aboutthe alignment state of the system. Rotational jitter of the turret can becorrected by the fast steering mirror located between the primary andsecondary mirror. In case of the irreversible structural deformation, theLaser Beam Director must be realigned.656936, Poster SessionImage seeker simulation for shortrange surfacetosurface missileS. Jin, H.

An Internet worm is a selfpropagating program that automatically replicates itself to vulnerablesystems and spreads across the Internet. Most deployed wormdetection systems are signaturebased. They look for specific bytesequences called attack signatures that are known to appear in theattack traffic. Conventionally, the signatures are manually identified byhuman experts through careful analysis of the byte sequence fromcaptured attack traffic. We propose to embed the traffic sequence to ahighdimensional phase space using chaos theory. We have observedthat the signature sequence of a specific worm will occupy specificregions in the phase space, which may be appropriately called theinvariant subspace of the worm. The invariant subspace of the wormseparates itself widely from the subspace of the normal traffic. Thisseparation allows us to construct three simple metrics, each of whichcompletely separates 100 normal traffic streams from 200 worm trafficstreams, without training in the conventional sense. Therefore, themethod is at least as accurate as any existing methods. Moreimportantly, our method is much faster than existing methods, such asbased on expectation maximization and hidden Markov models.657002, Session 1Information fusion and visualization of large complexattack graphs for networks securityH. Chen, G. Chen, Intelligent Automation Inc. M. Kruger, Office ofNaval Research E. Blasch, Air Force Research Lab. D. Penwell,Alion Science and Technology Corp.We propose a comprehensive and innovative approach for analysis andvisualization of large complex multistep cyber attack graphs.  First, weselect the radial spacefilling hierarchy visualization module for largecomplex multistep cyber attack graph due to its strengths in spaceefficiency and ease of interpretation. Once an attack is correlated, theattack notification service retrieves the correlated alerts that comprisethe attack scenario and uses it to instantiate an attack node, bindingformal parameters to arguments along the way. Second, we build ourplan recognition system after a lowlevel alert correlation step thatincludes alert aggregation and alert correlation. Third, we do not requirea complete ordered alert sequence for inference. We have the capabilityof handling partial order and unobserved activity evidence sets. Fourth,we provide advanced approaches to predict potential attacks based onobserved intrusion evidence. Bayesian Network based predication canincorporate prior knowledge of attack transition patterns and handleuncertainty in the correlation process. Moreover, we apply dynamicgames for graphbased attack prediction and response since theintegration of attack graphs and alert correlation graphs provideperfect knowledge about the attackers strategy space which isnecessary to compute Nash equilibriums out of any mathematicalgame.657003, Session 1Summary of results on optimal camera placement forboundary monitoringR. J. Holt, Queensborough Community CollegeCUNY H. Man, J.Wang, I. Mukherjee, R. Martini, R. Netravali, Stevens Institute ofTechnologyWe consider problems of placing cameras so that every point on athreedimensional perimeter is covered while using the smallest numberof cameras.  Taken into consideration are visibility concerns, wherefeatures such as mountains must not be allowed to come between acamera and a boundary point that would otherwise be in a camerasfield of view.One problem involves finding the positions and orientations of camerasso that each boundary point is covered at least once, while using theminimal number of cameras.  Another considers double coverage, withthe camera positions staggered so that they may be calibrated.  We findconfigurations where average or maximum calibration error isminimized.  We provide an iterative algorithm that accomplishes thesetasks.Furthermore, we investigate a joint optimization camera placementproblem.  This involves the placement of a second set of cameras afteran initial minimal configuration where each boundary point is at leastsingly covered.  The second set of cameras is chosen with thesimultaneous aims of minimizing calibration error while using theminimal number of cameras.  In this scenario the user may choose athreshold for the maximum calibration error, and a tradeoff between thenumber of cameras and this threshold ensues.  Again an algorithm isprovided.657004, Session 1Evaluation of data mining techniques for suspiciousnetwork activity classification using honeynets dataA. Grgio, R. Santos, Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas EspaciaisBrazil A. Montes, Ctr. de Pesquisas Renato Archer BrazilAs the amount and types of network services increases, their loganalysis has become a very difficult task. The filtering of relevantinformation by a network administrator is a very time consuming task,which may be impossible to accomplish if the network in question islarge.There are several ways to optimize this hard work in order to provide areduced log for analysis. Some of them are whitelisting or artificialignorance and intrusion detection system tools which only identifypreknown signatures, but all of these techniques require a lot of tuningwork and can still let pass falsenegatives or ignore interesting logentries.Nowadays, researchers are evaluating data miningbased approachesfor intrusion detection in network logs, such as genetic algorithms,neural networks, clustering algorithms, etc. Some of those yield goodresults, but require a very large number of attributes gathered bynetwork traffic to detect useful information.We apply some of those approaches selforganizing maps and decisiontrees in a reduced number of attributes on some log data sets acquiredfrom honeynets to classify traffic logs as normal or suspicious. Ourresults allow us not only to identify unlabeled logs but also to describewhich attributes were used for the decision and which logs fall neither inthe normal or suspicious categories but should be better examinedfor further identification.This approach will provide a very reduced amount of logs to thenetwork administrator, improving the log analysis task and helping todiscover new kinds of attack in their networks.300 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss657005, Session 1Selection of intrusion detection system threshold boundsfor effective sensor fusionC. Thomas, N. Balakrishnan, Indian Institute of Science IndiaThe motivation behind the fusion IDS was the realization that with theincreasing traffic and increasing complexity of attacks, none of thepresent day stand alone Intrusion Detection Systems can meet the highdemands for a very high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. Multisensor fusion can be used to meet these requirements by a refinementof the combined responses of different Intrusion Detection Systems. Inthis paper, we show the design technique of Sensor Fusion to bestutilize the useful response from multiple sensors by an appropriateadjustment of the fusion threshold. The threshold is usually chosenaccording to the past experiences or by an Expert system. In this paper,we show that the choice of the  threshold bounds according to theChebychev inequality principle performs better. This approach is alsohelping to solve the problem of scalability and has the advantage offailsafe capability. This paper theoretically models the fusion IDS for thepurpose of showing its improved performance, supplemented with theempirical evaluation.An experimental Packet Header Anomaly Detector PHAD, thatmonitors the 33 fields of the Ethernet, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols ischosen as one of the sensors  for the combination.Observing theheader fields makes it efficient to detect Probes and DOS attacks. Thesecond IDS chosen is Application Layer Anomaly Detector ALADand itcomplements PHAD in detection by monitoring incoming TCPconnections to well known server ports. ALAD has six attributes fordetection, namely source IP address, destination IP address,destination port, TCP flags, application  keywords and the applicationargument. It detects the R2L attacks with high detection rate since R2Lattacks normally exploits the application layer.The combination of these sensors is shown to detect more attacks thanthe individual components. Since PHAD and ALAD detect sufficientlydifferent attacks, their results can be merged for improved performance.The combination is done in different ways like i taking all the alarmsfrom each system and avoiding the duplicates, ii taking the alarmsfrom each system by fixing  threshold bounds false alarms between100 and 200 and iii rulebased fusion with a prior knowledge of theindividual sensor performance. A number of evaluation metrics wereused, and the results indicate that there is an overall enhancement onthe performance of the combined detector using simple rulebasedfusion and significantly better results using sensor fusion incorporatingthe threshold bounds.657029, Session 1BOT armies as threats to network securityS. B. Banks, Calculated Insight M. R. Stytz, Institute for DefenseAnalysesBotnets, or bot armies, are large groups of remotely controlledmalicious software.  Bot armies pose one of the most serious securitythreats to all networks whether they are civilian or government owned,or carry classified or unclassified message traffic.  Botnets, remotelycontrolled and operated by bot masters or bot herders, can launchmassive denial of service attacks, multiple penetration attacks, or anyother malicious network activity on a massive scale.  While bot armyactivity has, in the past, been limited to fraud, blackmail, and otherforms of criminal activity, their potential for causing largescale damageto the entire internet, for launching largescale, coordinated attacks ongovernment computers and networks, and for largescale, coordinateddata gathering from thousands of users and computers on any networkhas been underestimated.  This paper will discuss the challenges posedby the bot army problem by examining their means for infiltration,operation, control, and cleansing .  At the present time, all bot activity isillegal.  The use, creation, or distribution of bots is an illegal activity as isthe use, creation, or distribution of any of the technologies that botsemploy  except for internet chat, also called internet relay chat IRC.So, this paper will not discuss how to build bots but the threats theypose.In a botnet or bot army, computers can be used to spread spam,launch denialofservice attacks against Web sites, conduct fraudulentactivities , and prevent authorized network traffic from traversing thenetwork.  On the internet in 2004, it was estimated that over 70 of allspam messages are coming from bot armies , the number today isestimated to be higher.  Running a bot army can be highly profitable forexample, in todays civilian bot army economy, a botmaster  couldhave 100,000 machines under his control and will contract to send amillion email.  Because of the number of machines under his control,the bot master will have each machine send out only 10 messages.  Itsvery hard for the owner of a machine that is compromised to know that10 email messages went out on any given day.  As a result, itsvirtually impossible for an average person to know whether or not theirmachine has been drafted into a bot army and is being used fornefarious purposes, and the presence of bots on classified computerscannot, at this time, be ruled out.  Because of the threat posed by botarmies and the possibility that any computer could, at any time, hostone or more bots we have undertaken research to characterize botinfections, bot army tactical and strategic operations, and thetechnologies that bots rely upon.  Our goal is to use this knowledge toprovide better defenses against bots and bot army operations.In the paper we will discuss botnet technology and the technologiesthat underlie this threat to network and computer security.  The firstsection of the paper introduces our research in botnets and motivatesthe need for improved protection against botnets, their technologies,and for further research about botnets.  The second containsbackground information about bot armies and their key underlyingtechnologies.  The third section presents a discussion of the types ofattacks that botnets can conduct and potential defenses against them.The fourth section contains a summary and suggestions for futureresearch and development.A folksy introduction to the topic of bots and bot armies can be foundat httpzine.dal.netpreviousissuesissue22botnet.phpOne exception is rootkit use to protect copyrights, a controversial useof this powerful technology see httpwww.sysinternals.comblog200510sonyrootkitsanddigitalrights.html for more information.The fraudulent activities are becoming more organized and closelyresemble the Mafia in organization, see Httpwww2.csoonline.comblogview.htmlCID23687sourcecsonewswatchSteve Linford as reported byIllett, D.

Lynch, Jr., Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. P. K. Willett, Univ. ofConnecticutIn this paper, unsupervised learning is utilized to mine unknownpatterns in training data when the feature space is correlated 1,2. Theapproach utilized to mine all unknown patterns is based on theBayesian Data Reduction Algorithm BDRA, which has been developedinto a patented system called the Data Extraction and Mining SoftwareTool DEMIST.  The primary contribution of this work will be todemonstrate the impact that correlation has on the ability toautomatically find unknown to the classifier patterns in simulatedtraining data. This will be accomplished by controlling the statisticaldependency between all features, and, for each case, computing theprobability of error in correctly identifying patterns in the data. Note, bycontrolling the correlation between features any interesting trends incomputed error probabilities will reveal explicitly the relationshipbetween statistically dependent features and mining patterns in thedata. Further, results of applying the classifier DEMIST to real worldtraining data will also be illustrated.1 R. S. Lynch, Jr. and P. K.

P. Shah, N. H. Younan, S. S. Durbha, R. L. King, Mississippi StateUniv. and GeoResources InstituteIn general, reflectance and spatial patterns characterize the geospatialdata. Current semanticenabled framework image retrieval systems forgeospatial data extract primitive features based on color, textureSpatial Gray Level Dependency  SGLD matrices, and shape from thesegmented homogenous region. However, the form of extractingtextural information is computationally expensive. The stateoftheartimage mining system for multimedia image archives uses the wavelettransform for feature extraction to quickly and efficiently capture colorand texture information. Since an image consists of three bands, colorinformation is captured by converting the RGB space into HSV space.Thus, a different approach is required to capture the completereflectance pattern, an important characteristic of geospatial data.This work proposes a new method to perform fast coarse imagesegmentation using descriptors obtained by combining the Fouriertransform along the spectral axis and the 2Dwavelet transform alongthe spatial axis to capture color and texture information forsegmentation. These features are later on used for the regionbasedretrieval in the earth observation data archives. This work also developsan approach to adaptively select the number of decomposition levelrequired for the wavelet transform to effectively capture texturalinformation in an image. Initial results show promising use of thesefeatures for image information mining from geospatial data archives.657010, Session 2Genetic programbased data mining of fuzzy decisiontrees and methods of improving convergence andreducing bloatJ. F. Smith III, Naval Research Lab.A data mining procedure for automatic determination of fuzzy decisiontree structure using a genetic program GP is discussed.  A GP is analgorithm that evolves other algorithms or mathematical expressions.Innovative methods of accelerating convergence of the data miningprocedure and reducing bloat are given.  In genetic programming, bloatrefers to excessive tree growth.  It has been observed that the trees inthe evolving GP population will grow by a factor of three every 50generations.  When evolving mathematical expressions much of thebloat is due to the expressions not being in algebraically simplest form.So a bloat reduction method based on automated computer algebrahas been introduced.  The effectiveness of this procedure is discussed.Also, rules based on fuzzy logic have been introduced into the GP itselfto accelerate convergence, reduce bloat and produce a solution morereadily understood by the human user.  These rules are discussed aswell as other techniques for convergence improvement and bloatcontrol.  Comparisons between trees created using a genetic programand those constructed solely by interviewing experts are made.  Agenetic program evolved tree is shown to be superior to one created byhand using expertise alone.  A new coevolutionary method thatimproves the control logic evolved by the GP by having a geneticalgorithm evolve pathological scenarios is discussed.  The effect on thecontrol logic is considered.  Finally, additional methods that have beenused to validate the data mining algorithm are discussed.657013, Session 3Maximizing information recovery from rankorder codesB. B. Sen, S. Furber, The Univ. of Manchester United KingdomThe central nervous system encodes information in sequences ofasynchronouslygenerated voltage spikes, but the precise details of thisencoding are not wellunderstood. Thorpe proposed rankorder codesas an explanation of the observed speed of information processing inthe human visual system. Our work here is inspired by the performanceof SpikeNET, a biologically inspired neural architecture using rankordercodes for information processing. The purpose is to find a means ofextracting the maximum possible perceptually important informationcontained in the rankorder encoded visual stimulus with respect to theoriginal. For this, we simulate a model developed by VanRullen andThorpe which mimics retinal information processing by passing an inputimage through a bank of Difference of Gaussian DoG filters and thenencoding the resulting coefficients in rankorder. To test theeffectiveness of this encoding in capturing the information content of animage, the rankorder representation is decoded to reconstruct theinput. Since the DoG filters are approximately orthogonal functions,they are treated as their own inverses in the reconstruction process. Weuse a slightly modified version of an objective metric proposed byPetrovic and observe that around 75 of the perceptually importantinformation is retained in the reconstructed stimulus with respect to theoriginal. In the present work we reconstruct the input using a pseudoinverse of the DoG filterbank with the aim of improving thereconstruction. We observe that there is an increase of 10  15 in theinformation retrieved from a reconstructed stimulus as a result ofinverting the filterbank.657014, Session 3Impact of information assurance on the performance ofsecure messaging systemsS.

Tsumoto, S. Hirano, Shimane Univ. JapanThis paper presents a cluster analysis method for multidimensionaltimeseries data on clinical laboratory examinatios. Our methodrepresents the time series of test results as trajectories inmultidimensional space, and compares their structural similarity byusing the multiscale comparison technique. It enables us to find theparttopart correspondences between two trajectories, taking intoaccount the relationships between different tests. The resultantdissimilarity can be further used with clustering algorithms for findingthe groups of similar cases.

R. Stytz, Institute for Defense Analyses S. B. Banks, CalculatedInsightThe modeling and simulation community MS continues to strive forincreased fidelity within simulation environments.  However, this quest forincreased fidelity often requires the use of classified information, models,and processing techniques.  The use of classified information andsoftware greatly complicates the development, testing, and use of thesimulation environment.  The problems associated with highfidelitysimulation environments that rely upon classified information andsoftware are compounded by the use of unclassified software,techniques, and data.  The mix of classified and unclassified data,software, and computations further complicates simulation developmentand activities and, typically, results in the classification of the entiresimulation environment.  This approach, while proven and trustworthy, isno longer necessary.  Two technologies are now available that wouldpermit the secure deployment of multilevel security simulationenvironments at only a modest increase in cost and effort above thatrequired for the development of an unclassified simulation environment.The common practice of simply increasing simulation environmentsecurity to the highest classification level of any data or software within itunnecessarily increases simulation development costs and unnecessarilycomplicates simulation environment development.  The two technologiesthat should be used are virtual machine technology and virtual privatenetwork technology.Virtual machine and virtual private network technologies are not new forexample, virtual machine technology was first devised in the 1960s.However, we currently only now have the computational power becomeavailable in conjunction with an ease of use and deployment to permitthese technologies to be efficiently employed in military simulations.Together, they allow the simulation environment designer to developenvironments and applications within them wherein computations areisolated, information is assured to be protected, and informationcommunication between the different computational engines within thecomputer are secure.Briefly, virtual machines and virtual private networks operate in thefollowing manner.  In a virtual machine all components of a givencomputer hardwareoperating system combination are replicated within ahost operating system to provide the computational illusion that allapplications executing within the virtual operating system are running onthe original softwarehardware combination hardware however, thissituation is not the case.  A virtual machine does not add functionality tothe operating systems and applications within them that it hosts butinstead provides functionality and a software interface to them that isidentical to the replicated system and also controls communicationbetween the virtual machines.  In this environment, there is completeprotection of all actual system resources and hardware from each of thevirtual machines each virtual machine is also isolated from all othervirtual machines.  Communication between virtual machines is possible,and is usually patterned upon network communication, an importantpoint to remember as it indicates that the use of virtual private networksis practicable.  A virtual private network VPN uses a public transportsystem  typically the Internet  for private communications by applyingencryption to preserve privacy . VPNs are most commonly used toconnect two networks at different locations.  This technique plugs theremote computers into the local network, consolidating the two physicalnets into a single logical network.   The combination of full participationby all resources coupled with assured privacy networks, while using apublic network link, is the hallmark of a VPN.  The compelling appeal ofthe VPN is that it is inexpensive relative to other forms of providingprivate communication.In this paper we will discuss our approach to the use of virtual machineand virtual private network technology to increase simulation security.The first section of the paper introduces our research area andmotivates the need for improved security for computations and intercomputation communication within simulation environments.  Thesecond contains background information about virtual machines andvirtual private networks.  The third section presents our generalizeddesign for the use of VMs and VPNs in simulation environments andshows how the general design can be used to increase simulationenvironment security.  The fourth section contains a summary andsuggestions for future research and development.1A VPN is typically defined as the emulation of a private wide areanetwork facility using IP technologies.657017, Session 4AutoCorrel II A neural network event correlationapproachM. G. Dondo, P. Mason, Defence Research and DevelopmentCanada Canada N. Japkowicz, R. D. Smith, Univ. of OttawaCanadaWe have successfully implemented a twostage event correlation modelfor IDS alerts. The model is designed to automate alert and incidentsmanagement and reduce the workload on an IDS analyst. We achievethis correlation by clustering similar alerts together, thus allowing theanalyst to only look at a few clusters instead of hundreds or thousandsof alerts. The first stage of this model uses an ANNbasedautoassociator. The autoassociator is trained to reproduce each alert atits output, and it uses the error metric between its input and output tocluster similar alerts together. The accuracy of the system is improvedby adding another machinelearning stage which attempts to combineclosely related clusters produced by the first stage into superclusters.The second stage uses the EM clustering algorithm. The model andperformance of this model are tested with intrusion alerts generated bya Snort IDS on DARPAs 1999 IDS evaluation data as well asincidents.org alerts.This work is a followup of our earlier work, Autocorrel I, in which weattempted to make an IDS analysts job easier by clustering similaralerts together, thereby reducing the number of alerts that an analysthas to deal with. In this work we try to address the shortcomings ofAutocorrel I, in particular the accuracy of the results. In our conclusionsto the Autocorrel I model, we identified the source of our errors was inthe collapsing of a 42tuple input pattern into a single threshold valuewhich was used to perform the clustering. Therefore, in this work weadd a second stage to provide a second layer of clustering. This secondstage combines the threshold heuristic of the first stage Autocorrel Iwith raw attributes from Snort alerts.We propose to use a neural networkbased novelty detection approachand a machinelearning clustering algorithm to identify and clusteralerts into smaller attack categories. In this way, the analysts job ismade significantly easier.657018, Session 4New metrics for blog miningB.

In order tomonitor blogging about foreign policy and terrorism issues, we mustdevelop models and metrics that represent blogs correctly.  Thestructure of blogs requires new techniques for evaluating such metricsas the relevance, specificity, credibility and timeliness of blog entriestechniques that have been developed for standard information retrievalpurposes e.g. Googles PageRank are suboptimal when applied toblogs because of their high degree of exophoricity, quotation, brevity,and rapidity of update.  In this paper, we motivate new approaches toevaluating metrics related to blog entry relevance, specificity, timelinessand credibility and report on the evaluation of a new blog search andanalysis tools we are developing. These tools utilize new blogspecificmetrics and techniques for extracting the necessary information fromblog entries automatically, using some shallow natural languageprocessing techniques supported by background knowledge capturedin domainspecific ontologies.657019, Session 4Adaptive GrahmSchmidt orthogonalization for theprojectionslice synthetic discriminant function filterV. R. Riasati, Boeing Satellite Systems D. Grishin, Univ. ofCaliforniaDavisIn the past, we have used various methods to reduce the data thatrepresent synthetic discriminant function filters, specially, theprojectionslice synthetic discriminant filter PSDF.  One of the primaryreasons for using the PSDF is the inherent data dimension reductionthat is achieved through the use of the projectionslice theorem, PST.The use of the PST allows for a powerful technique to segmentinformational content into lower dimensional spans whilesimultaneously providing a complete and naturally linked data set.Shannon provides a formula for maximum information capacity in achannel that utilizes as the most efficient informational codingindependent data samples, as this spreads the spectrum evenly acrossthe channel band.  This implies that independent information thatrepresent a correlated set contains maximal information if the key thatrepresents the correlatedness of the data is known, otherwise theindependent data are purely random.  By using a novel AdaptiveGrahmSchmidt AGS procedure we form a method that identifiespatterns in correlated data for the removal of the interdependence andthereby maximization of information content.  In this work we subjectthe lowerdimensional data sets in the PSDF to the AGS to maximizethe information content of the PSDF and share some of our findings,results, and deductions.657020, Session 4Semantic search via concept annealingK. A.

The specific representationsdeveloped have been targeted at facilitating highly efficient andeffective semantic indexing and searching.   This new generation ofsearch capability enables additional processing i.e. allsource tracking,relationship extraction, and total system resource management atrates, precisions, and accuracies previously considered infeasible.

DolocMihu, V. V. Raghavan, Univ. of Louisiana at LafayetteThe effectiveness of a CBIR system depends on the choice of visualfeatures and of the similarity metric that models the user perception ofsimilarity. Since the latter is very difficult to model, the current tendencyin the Image Retrieval community is to use both contentbased imageretrieval and textbased image retrieval to enhance the performance ofthe Image Retrieval System. Learning and result merging in this contexthave been a concern of both the Information Retrieval community see3 for a survey and the multimedia database community 4,5.In a CBIR system, there is a question of how to combine or to use theinformation derived about an image based on different feature typese.g., annotation, color, shape, etc.. In this work, we assume that animage is described by multiple feature types, both textual annotationand visual color. In this context, searching for images involves themixture of these different feature types. The problem is that, in real webbased applications, it is not known a priori the importance of eachfeature to the user request. We are interested in effective and efficientmodalities of dynamically learning the weights of the feature typesnecessary to form a final best ranking of the image collection. Our finalgoal is building an effective and efficient Webbased Adaptive ImageRetrieval System.The goal of this work is to investigate the applicability of twoapproaches, namely ThreeWay Aspect Model 8,9 and CoTraining2,7, to our image retrieval problem, when we employ learning viafeedback from user. To our knowledge, similar type of study was donefor text retrieval, with different results on real collections e.g. 7, butnot for images.In the following, we briefly present the framework in which we applythese approaches. In this work, we are using color representations ofimages in RGB color space 256 colors, and annotation obtained byusing same approach as in 1. User gives feedback on images, i.e.querybyexample approach, as relevant and not relevant binaryrelevance.The ThreeWay Aspect Model 8 was proposed in order to unifycollaborative and contentbased approaches for recommendersystems. This probabilistic model extends the aspect model proposedby Hofmann 6 to include threeway cooccurence data among users,documents and document content. Further, the authors extended theirwork to improve this model 9,10. However, to our knowledge, thismodel has not been applied to image collections.In our view, images from our collections can fall under several topics. Acharacteristic of the ThreeWay Aspect Model is that it can handle suchdata, which motivates us to investigate its applicability to our imageretrieval task.In our context, a user gives feedback on a set of imagesXd1,d2,...,dN, which together with the annotations Aa1,a2,...,aMand colors Cc1,c2,...,cS they contain, form observations d,a,c,which are associated with one of the latent variables z inZz1,z2,...,zK. We think of the latent variables as they are representingtopics. An image might pertain to several topics, but an observationbelongs to only one topic latent variable z. Images, annotations, andcolors are assumed independent, given the topic.Conceptually, a user chooses a topic, which generates images and theircontent according to topic specific distributions. Similar to 8,9, modelparameters are learned by using EM algorithm to find a local maximumof the loglikelihood of the training data, and then, not seen images areranked according to Pd,a,c.The CoTraining algorithm 2,7 uses two distinct, assumedindependent, representations of the entire image collection to learn fromseen by the user and not seen images. In our case, the tworepresentations correspond to annotations, and color histograms inRGB.

Ateach iteration, each classifier labels two not seen images, one asrelevant and one as not relevant. For classification, each classifierchooses the image for which it has the highest confidence. Then, eachclassifier learns from the new set of seen images. The process isrepeated until all not seen images are classified in either relevant or notrelevant class.Researchers 2,7,8,10 tested these two approaches for documentretrieval on different collections. The applicability of either methodseems to depend on the collection characteristics. However, to ourknowledge, in case of images a such study is missing. Moreover, onecan notice that both algorithms assume that the image representationsare independent, an assumption which is not realistic for images.Therefore, to study their applicability to real image collections,experiments are necessary.Experimental tests on four image test collection of sizes 5000 and10000 are in progress, and we hope the results will offer useful insightson applicability of either approach to a webbased adaptive imageretrieval system. For both algorithms we use naive Bayes. In ourexperimental study, we also investigate several improvementsregarding both effectiveness and efficiency for both approaches, whichare proposed in the literature, such as the similarity matrix used toovercome the overfitting in TWAPM 9, and the pool size in CoTraining7.REFERENCES1 Ana B.

Ting, W. Yu, Y. Li, Chongqing Univ. of Posts andTelecommunications ChinaGranular Computing GrC is an emerging theory which simulates theprocess of human brain understanding and solving problems. Roughset theory is a tool for dealing with uncertainty and vagueness aspectsof knowledge model. SMLGRC algorithm introduces GrC to classicrough set algorithm, and make the length of the rules relatively short,but it can not process mass datasets. In order to solve this problem,based on the analysis of the hierarchical granular model of informationtable, the method of granular distribution list GDL is introduced togenerate granular, and the granular computing algorithm SLMGrC isimproved. Sample covered factor SCF is also introduced to control thegeneration of rules when the algorithm generates conflicted rules. Theimproved algorithm can process mass datasets directly withoutinfluencing the correction rate of the SLMGrC.

Hao, Harbin Institute of Technology China C. Liu,Capital Normal Univ. ChinaThe data warehouse is a repository of information collected frommultiple, possibly heterogeneous, autonomous, distributed databases.The information stored at the data warehouse is in form of views,referred to as materialized views. The selection of the materialized viewsis one of the most important decisions in designing a data warehouse.Materialized views are stored in the data warehouse for the purpose ofefficiently implementing online analytical processing queries. The firstissue for the user to consider is query response time. So, in this paper,we develop algorithms to select a set of views to materialize in datawarehouse in order to minimize the total view maintenance cost underthe constraint of a given query response time. We call it querycostview selection problem.First, cost graph and cost model are presented. Second, the methodsfor selecting materialized views by using random algorithms arepresented. The genetic algorithm is applied to the materialized viewsselection problem. But with the development of genetic process, thelegal solution produced become more and more difficult, so a lot ofsolutions are eliminated and producing time of the solutions islengthened in genetic algorithm. Therefore, improved algorithm hasbeen presented, which is the combination of simulated annealingalgorithm and genetic algorithm for the purpose of solving the querycost view selection problem. Finally, in order to test the function andefficiency of our algorithms, experiment test is adopted. Theexperiments show that the given methods can provide nearoptimalsolutions in limited time and woks better in practical cases.Conf. 6570 Data Mining, Intrusion Detection, Information Assurance, andData Networks Security 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 305Conf. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion Architectures,Algorithms, and Applications 2007WednesdayThursday 1112 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information FusionArchitectures, Algorithms, and Applications 2007657101, Session 1A novel method to evaluate the performance of pansharpening algorithmsV. P. Shah, N. H. Younan, R. L. King, Mississippi State Univ. andGeoResources InstituteRecently, Alparone et. al. proposed a QNR index to evaluate the jointquality of pansharpened image without using the original highresolution reference image. Their experimental results show that theQNR index for a pansharpened image, obtained by multiplying themultispectral image with a constant, is high compared to few otherstateoftheart techniques, which indicates that this index maybebiased to algorithms that preserve the spectral information. Moreover,the current technique for joint evaluation of spatial and spectral qualitywithout reference does not allow to quantitatively associate importanceto a particular image quality. Pansharpened images are useful in a widevariety of applications. Hence, giving quantitative importance to spatialor spectral quality, depending on the nature of target application, maybe required to yield maximum benefit of pansharpening.This work proposes a novel global index based on harmonic meantheory to jointly evaluate the performance of pansharpening algorithmswithout using a reference image. The harmonic mean of relative spatialinformation gain and relative spectral preservation provide a uniqueglobal index to compare the performance of different algorithms. Thenormalized average information divergence of pansharpened imageand source multispectral image are used to measure the amount ofspectral fidelity. Synthetic pan images are generated from the pansharpened and source multispectral images. Mutual informationbetween the original pan and synthetic pan images is used to calculatethe relative gain. The relative gain helps to quantify the amount ofspatial information injected by the algorithm. The trend of the proposedindex will be compared with other quality indexes using wellknownpansharpening algorithms on high resolution IKONOS and Quickbirdand medium resolution LandSat 7 ETM datasets.657103, Session 1Realtime objectbased image registration usingimproved MRANZ. Yue, P. Narasimha, FastVDO LLC K. Subbarao, M. T. Manry, TheUniv. of TexasArlington P. N. Topiwala, FastVDO LLCThe registration of images from cameras of different types andor atdifferent locations is of great interest for both military and civilianapplications. Most available techniques are pixel level registration anduse intensity correlation to spatially align pixels from the two cameras.Lots of computation is consumed to operate on each pixel of theimages and as a result, it would be difficult to register the images in realtime. Furthermore, images from different types of cameras may havedifferent intensity distributions for corresponding pixels which willdegrade the registration accuracy.In this paper we propose to use improved Minimal Resource AllocationNetwork MRAN to solve the image registration problem from twocameras. Potential features are added to improve the performance ofMRAN. There are two main contributions in this paper  First, weightsgoing directly from inputs to outputs are introduced and theseparameters are updated by including in the extended Kalman filteralgorithm. Second, initial number of hidden units for the sequentialtraining of MRAN are specified and the means of the initial hidden unitsare precalculated using Self Organizing Maps. The experimental resultsshow that the proposed algorithm peforms very well both in speed andaccuracy.657104, Session 1Convergence rate improvement in NMIbasedmultisensor image registrationJ. H. Lee, J. B. Ra, Korea Advanced Institute of Science andTechnology South KoreaRecently, a multisensor image fusion system is widely investigated dueto its growing applications. In the system, robust and accurate multimodal image registration is essential and the fast registration is requiredfor many applications. This paper proposes a fast registration algorithmfor multimodal image sequences that are acquired from two differentelectrooptic EO and infrared IR sensors. In the registration of multimodal images, a normalized mutual information NMI based registrationalgorithm is preferred due to its robust and accurate performance.However, it suffers from a high computational complexity in theoptimization process. The downhill simplex optimization method ispopular in NMI based registration because of its fast convergence rate.However, a reduction of computational complexity is still required in themethod for semirealtime applications. In this paper, we attempt tominimize the computational complexity in the registration process. Wefirst modify the searching methodology for unconstrained functionminimization in the ordinary downhill simplex algorithm. In the modifiedscheme, to reduce the number of function evaluations, we suggest newvertex movements related to the fast vertex contraction and thedirection determination of succeeding simplex. We also minimize thefunction evaluation time by adopting the linearization process of theprojective transformation model in the interpolation routine. Simulationresults show that the proposed algorithm noticeably reduces thecomputational complexity by 30 compared to the conventional NMIbased registration algorithm.657106, Session 2Crosssensor fusion approach for visible and infraredimageryM. Ouendeno, S. P. Kozaitis, Florida Institute of TechnologyWe used a method for combining crosssensor image data thatpreserves sensorunique characteristics of visible and infrared imagery.The basis of our approach is a set of forward wavelet transforms,optimized to preserve the individual information content of each sensorimage followed by a common inverse transform that is designed tosimultaneously preserve the most desirable information characteristicsfrom each image after fusion. We used denoising methods in ourreconstruction to reduce any errors introduced in the reconstructionprocess. Because of the unique nature of our approach we compareddifferent fusion algorithms and reported on the results. We found thatour approach could form the basis of fusion approach when informationbetween sensors is correlated.657107, Session 2Realtime EOIR sensor fusion on a portable computerand headmounted displayZ. Yue, P. Topiwala, FastVDO LLCMultisensor platforms are widely used in surveillance video systems forboth military and civilian applications. The complimentary nature ofdifferent types of sensors e.g. EO and IR sensors makes it possible toobserve the scene under almost any condition daynightfogsmoke. Inthis paper, we propose an innovative EOIR sensor registration andfusion algorithm which runs realtime on a portable computing unit withheadmounted display. The EOIR sensor suite is mounted on a helmetfor a dismounted soldier and the fused scene is shown in the goggledisplay upon the processing on a portable computing unit.

The experimental results on real captured video showthe system works very well both in speed and in performance.657108, Session 2Fusion and kernel type selection in adaptive imageretrievalA. DolocMihu, V. V. Raghavan, Univ. of Louisiana at LafayetteThe goal of this work is to investigate the relationships between featuresrepresenting images, fusion schemes for these features and kernel typesused in an Webbased Adaptive Image Retrieval System. Using theKernel Rocchio learning method, several kernels having polynomial andGaussian forms are applied to general images represented byannotations and by color histograms in RGB and HSV color spaces.Different fusion schemes, which incorporate kernel selectorcomponents based on score distribution models, are proposed and planto be studied through experiments.  Experimental tests on four imagetest collection are in progress, and we hope the results will offer usefulinsights on this issue.657109, Session 2Merging infrared and color visible images with an contrastenhanced fusion methodG. Li, K. Wang, Jilin Univ. ChinaWe propose a contrast enhanced fusion CEF method for merginginfrared and color visible images. The method transforms the originalRGB color visible image into a perceptually decorrelated color space inorder to treat the achromatic and chromatic components separately. Theachromatic component and infrared image are combined by a grayscalefusion scheme, and the original achromatic component is replaced by thegrayscale fused image. Before the data are retransformed back into theRGB color space, the means and variances between the originalachromatic component and the grayscale fused image are matched by alinear remapping. The remapping procedure can fairly enhance thecontrast of the final color fused image. We used the CEF method tomerge long wave infrared and color TV images. The experimental resultsshow that the proposed method can effectively produce a highcontrastcolor fused image with the similar natural characteristics as the originalcolor visible image. In addition, we have also illustrated that hybrid ofsimplecomplex CEF methods can be applied as a region of interest ROIimage fusion solution, which allows ROIs to be fused with better qualitythan the rest of the original images.657110, Session 3Multisensor detection and fusion techniqueA. Bhargave, B. E. Ambrose, F. S. Lin, M. I. Kazantzidis, BroadataCommunications, IncA multisensor detection and fusion technology is described in this paper.The system consist of inputs from three sensors, Infra Red, DopplerMotion, and Stereo Video. This choice of sensors is designed to give highreliability, infra red and Doppler to provide detection ability at night,stereo video has the ability to analyze depth and range information. Thecombination of these sensors has the ability to provide high probability ofdetection and very low false alarm rate. The technique consists of threeprocessing parts corresponding to each sensor data, and a fusionmodule, which makes the final decision based on the inputs from thethree parts. The signal processing and detection algorithms process theinputs from each sensors and provides a specific information to thefusion module. Fusion module is based on bayes belief propagationtheory. It takes the processed inputs from all the sensor modules andprovides a final decision on the presence and absense of objects, as wellas their reliability based on the iterative belief propagation algorithmoperating on decision graphs. A prototype system was built using thetechnique to study the feasibility of intrusion detection for NASAs launchdanger zone protection. The system verified the potential of the proposedalgorithms and proved the feasibility of high probability of detection andlow false alarm rates compared to many existing techniques.657111, Session 3A novel classification fusion technique for improvedperformanceT. Liu, G. A. Lampropoulos, G. Gigli, A.U.G. Signals Ltd. CanadaThe objective of this paper is to present an innovative fusion technique tooptimum fuse the classification results to improve the overallclassification performance.The key innovation is the transformation of static classifiers so that theyadapt to their local clutter environment. This is the adaptation andextension of CFAR detection techniques that adjust both the cluttermodel and target model based on a sampling of the local dataenvironment, so as to maintain the CFAR constraint. It will guide thedevelopment of similar approaches for classification. Based on thestatistics of different classes, the confidence levels will be assigned toeach pixel for all the classes. The confidence levels present theinformation that to what level we can trust this decision. The fusion will beprocessed using not only the decisions resulted from differentclassification algorithms, but also the corresponding confidence levels.There are two general approaches to using all the information. The first islinearly combining the decisions according to their confidence levels tooptimize the final decision. The second approach is to treat all of theoutputs as an intermediate feature space, regardless of the context, andthen train a new classifier on this intermediate feature space.Testing results using hyperspectral data will be presented. Confusionmatrices will be given to show the performance enhancement.Applications in agriculture, forestry, mining and exploration, and themilitary will benefit from the proposed classification fusion system.657112, Session 3Classifier combination and feature selection methods forpolarimetric SAR classificationG.

CanadaTraining classifiers individually, and then fusing their results, has thepotential to improve classification accuracy often, dramaticimprovements are realized. In this paper we examine how trainingclassifiers using multiple polarimetric features such as the CloudePottierdecomposition, even and odd bounce and the Polarimetric Whiteningfilter and then fusing their results affects performance of shipclassification.   We explore and compare two currently competingtechnologies of classifier bagging and classifier boosting for classifierfusion and then detail and compare the results with a new approachwhich conducts a search through solution space to configure an optimalclassifier given a library of classifiers and features.  A related andimportant facet of this work is feature selection and feature reductionmethods. We explore how the selection and removal of different featuresaffects classification performance of the classifier fusion methods andcontrast the efficacy of filter approaches using classifier bagging andboosting with the wrapper technique used by our new approach forclassifier fusion.  We also explore estimates of the classifier error andprovide estimates for noise bounds on the data and compareperformance of the different methods compared to the noise present indata.657113, Session 3Bayesian framework for ATR decisionlevel fusionexperimentsD.

Kahler, General Dynamics L. Goodwon, Air Force Research Lab.Real world Operating Conditions OCs influence sensor data that inturn affects the performance of target detection and identificationsystems utilizing the collected information.  The impact of operatingconditions on collected data is widely accepted, but not fullycharacterized.  OCs that affect data depend on sensor wavelength andassociated scenario phenomenology, and can vary significantlybetween electrooptical EO, infrared IR, and Radar sensors.  Thispaper will discuss what operating conditions might be modeled for eachsensor type and how they could affect automatic target recognitionATR systems designed for their respective sensory data.  The OCs arebroken out into four categories target, sensor, environment, and ATRalgorithm training.  These main categories will further containsubcategories with varying levels  of influence.  The purpose of thiswork is to develop an OC distribution model for the real world thatcan be used to realistically influence the performance of multiple ATRsystems, and ultimately the decision made from the fused ATR results.An accurate OC model will greatly enhance the performanceassessment of ATR and fusion systems.657115, Session 4A fullscale prototype multisensor system for firedetection and situational awarenessC. Minor, Nova Research, Inc. K. Johnson, S. RosePehrsson, J.Owrutsky, S. Wales, U.S. Naval Research Lab. D. Steinhurst, NovaResearch, Inc. D. Gottuk, Hughes Associates, Inc.The need for automated monitoring and assessment of events ofinterest within a space, such as chemical agent dispersal, toxicchemical spills, and fire or flood detection, has been a significantmotivation for the development and use of multisensor, multicriteriasensing systems 1.  Such multimodal sensing platforms offertheoretical benefits over more conventional point detection systems interms of robustness, sensitivity, selectivity, and applicability.Multimodal, spatially dispersed and networkenabled sensing platformscan generate complementary datasets that can be both mined withpattern recognition and feature selection techniques and merged witheventspecific data fusion algorithms to effectively increase the signal tonoise ratio of the system an effect analogous to signal averaging whilealso offering the potential for detecting a wider range of analytes orevents.  Additionally, such systems offer potential for resilience tomissing data and spurious sensor readings and malfunctions that is notpossible with individual sensing units.  In this way, multimodal systemscan provide faster and more accurate situational awareness than can beobtained with conventional sensor implementations.  Finally, a spatially,or even geographically, dispersed array of networked sensors canprovide the necessary platform flexibility to accommodate diverseconfigurations of fixed or mobile, standoff or point sensors to satisfy awide range of monitoring and assessment needs.Advances in communications and sensor technologies in recent yearshave made possible sophisticated implementations of heterogeneoussensor platforms for situational awareness.  However, such networkedmultisensor systems present their own unique set of development andimplementation challenges 2,3,4.  Care must be taken in selectingsensing modalities and sensors that provide complementary informationappropriate to the sensing application being developed.  A suitablenetwork architecture and communications interface must be designedthat is amenable to the differing data formats and interfaces typical ofcommercially developed sensors.  To realize the benefits of amultimodal approach, sensor data must be combined and evaluated ina manner that enhances performance without increasing false positives5.  These challenges are in addition to those common to conventionalsensor implementations  developing pattern recognition and featureextraction algorithms tailored to multiple event recognition andimplementing a realtime data acquisition and analysis and commandand control framework for the sensing system.NRL has recently developed a realtime, remote detection system,called Volume Sensor, for damage control and situational awarenesson U.S. Navy ships.  The new system was developed under theAdvanced Volume Sensor Task, an important element of the U.S. NavysOffice of Naval Research, Future Naval Capabilities, Advanced DamageCountermeasures ADC program, which seeks to develop anddemonstrate improved damage control capabilities for reducedmanning aboard future naval vessels 6.  The objective of the AdvancedVolume Sensor Task was to develop an affordable detection system thatcould identify shipboard damage control conditions and provide realtime threat level information for events such as flaming and smolderingfires, explosions, pipe ruptures, flooding, and gas releases.  VolumeSensor was designed to be a robust, low cost system that eliminatedfalse alarms typical of fire detections systems in industrialenvironments.The Volume Sensor uses a multisensor, multicriteria system approachcombining low cost commercialofftheshelf COTS hardwarecomponents integrated with intelligent software and smart data fusionalgorithms developed at NRL.  A schematic diagram is shown in Figure1.  This effort took advantage of existing and emerging technology inthe fields of optics, acoustics, image analysis and computer processingto add functionality to conventional surveillance camera installationsplanned for in new ship designs.  A diverse group of sensing modalitiesand network components was chosen using criteria that emphasizednot only their capability to provide pertinent damage controlinformation, but also their cost and ability to be integrated into existingship infrastructure.  Various spectral and acoustic sensors, new videoimaging techniques, and image recognition methods were investigatedand evaluated.  The downselected sensing platforms were integratedinto sensor suites that incorporated video cameras, long wavelengthnear infrared filtered cameras, single element spectral sensors, andhumanaudible microphones.  A multisensory data fusion approach wasused to provide overall detection capabilities for standoff identificationof damage control events within shipboard spaces.  Data fusiondecision algorithms were used to improve event detection rates whilereducing false positives and, most importantly, intelligently combine allavailable sensor data and information to provide the best possiblesituational awareness.Implementation of this approach required the development of anefficient, scalable, and adaptable design framework.  A number ofchallenges specific to multisensor systems were addressed duringVolume Sensor development and were met with solutions that areapplicable to heterogeneous sensor networks of any type.  Thesesolutions include 1 a uniform, but general format for encapsulatingsensor data, 2 a communications protocol for the transfer of sensordata and command and control of networked sensor systems, 3 thedevelopment of eventspecific data fusion algorithms, and 4 the designand implementation of modular and scalable system architecture.These solutions are transferable to other monitoring and assessmentapplications such as the detection of chemical warfare agents and toxicchemicals and this approach to multisensor integration can serve as atemplate for heterogeneous sensor integration for situationalawareness.This paper describes the development and evaluation of the fullscale,multicompartment prototype Volume Sensor.  Two Volumes SensorPrototype VSP systems were built and evaluated in a shipboard testseries onboard the Navys fullscale fire test facility, the exUSSShadwell 7.  The performance of the VSPs was compared to twocommercial video image detection VID systems and three spottypefire detection systems that were simultaneously evaluated.  During thistesting, the two prototype Volume Sensor systems demonstrated thecapability to provide highly accurate and timely situational awarenessregarding damage control events while simultaneously imparting anegligible footprint on the ships 100 Mbps Ethernet network andConf. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion Architectures,Algorithms, and Applications 2007308 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssmaintaining smooth and reliable operation in a realtime fashion.Analysis of test results has shown that the two VSPs demonstratedcomparable or better fire detection performance to the commercialsystems, with faster response times and excellent nuisance sourceimmunity.

Shen, G. Chen, Intelligent Automation Inc. J. B. Cruz, Jr., TheOhio State Univ. L. S. Haynes, Intelligent Automation Inc. M. Kruger,Office of Naval Research E. Blasch, Air Force Research Lab.There are increasing needs for research in the area of cyber situationalawareness. The protection and defense against cyber attacks tocomputer network is becoming inadequate as the hacker knowledgesophisticates and as the network and each computer system becomemore complex. Current methods for alert correlation to detect andidentify network attacks rely on data mining approaches that usefeatures or feature sets of network data to discover an attack. Theseapproaches are useful for simple attacks but for complex or coordinatedcyber intrusions, they have various issues such as false positive, limitedscalability, limits on detecting new types of attacks.This paper proposes an innovative information fusion based situationawareness and impact assessment approach for cyber network defense.There are two main parts data fusion module and dynamicadaptivefeature recognition module. Alters generated by Intrusion DetectionSensors IDSs or Intrusion Prevention Sensors IPSs are fed into the L0and L1 data fusion components. The fused objects and related pedigreeinformation are used by a featurepattern recognition module to generateprimitive prediction of intents of cyber attackers. If the observed featuresare already associated with adversary intents, we can easily obtain themby pattern recognition. In some timecritical applications, the primitiveprediction can be used before it is refined by relatively timeconsuminghighlevel data fusion.Highlevel L2 and L3 data fusion based on Markov game model andHierarchical Entity Aggregation HEA are proposed to refine the primitiveprediction generated in stage 1 and capture new unknown features.Markov Stochastic game method is used to estimate the belief of eachpossible cyber attack graph. Game theory can capture the nature ofcyber conflicts the determination of the strategies of attacking force istightly coupled to the determination of the strategies of the defense forceand vice versa. Also it can deal with the uncertainty and incompletenessof the available information.The captured unknown or new cyber attack patterns will be associatedto related L1 results in dynamic learning block, which takes deceptionreasoning, emotion reasoning, trendvariation identification, anddistribution model and calculation into account. Our approach todeception detection is heavily based on the application of patternrecognition techniques to detect and diagnose what we call outofnormal conditions in the cyber environment. The proposed emotionreasoning approach is mainly based on Peircean reasoning, whichrecognizes and articulates the human reasoning process as beingcomprised of three components abduction, deduction, and induction.The results of dynamic learning or refinement shall also be used toenhance L2 and L3 data fusion. This adaptive process may beconsidered as level 4 data fusion process refinement, see JDL model.Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of theMarkov game theoretic data fusion approach for cyber situationalawareness.657117, Session 4Hierarchical highlevel information fusion technologiesfor detection of weapons of mass destruction in a NavalenvironmentA. L. Crassidis, Rochester Institute of TechnologyIn this paper, the progression of Level 23 fusion of informationalcontent to obtain an advanced multiintelligent system for hierarchicalhigh level decision making processes is introduced. The goal is thedevelopment of an information integration mechanism to simplifyhuman decision making solving operational problems.  As technologycontinues to advance, and the proliferation of sensors in all platformincreases, the human decision makers are being overwhelmed withdata.  In this work, a novel approach in the near realtime detection ofhypotheses in asymmetric warfare scenarios i.e. urban warfare isdeveloped.  In particular, we introduce a Hierarchical High LevelInformation Fusion Technologies architecture with the followingobjectives 1 Create three stages of high level fusion local, distributedand network centric so that the amount of data transmitted betweenstages is minimized but remains complete and comprehensive 2 Eachstage will give the corresponding decisionmaker the appropriate levelof information 3 Understand the difference and similarities of thedifferent stages of fusion within each environment ground, maritimeand air 4 Measure the gain and lose of transmitting higher level fuseddata among stages rather than Level 01 data 5 Determine the loss ofgranularity versus the gain in communication efficiencies both from abandwidth perspective as well as the humanintheloop 6 Drive anoptimization set of tools that will manage the sensors from therequirements of the fusion process optional to this program 7Understand the advantages of a pullapproach rather than a pushapproach in data gatheringfusion based on the ultimate needs ofdecisionmakers. We assume all required Level 1 type sensorinformation is available a priori, so that the primary focus of the work isLevel 23 fusion. The hypotheses are tested using a developedsimulation software package with predefined evaluation metrics. Theevaluation metrics include Level 23 fusion assessment tools using arealistic naval threat scenario example. The software model simulates anaval threat from an incoming vessel such as a cargo ship containing aweapon of mass destruction, included in a group of nonthreateningvessels, to access the Level 23 algorithm. The simulation package isused as an evaluation measure and performance platform providing anoperational utility assessment tool.

Many decisionmakingConf. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion Architectures,Algorithms, and Applications 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 309problems can benefit from  and some of them require  simultaneousconsideration of multiple sources, dissimilar in terms of the semanticsof the information they provide.  These sources may be sensors ofmultiple modalities, collocated, spatially distributed, or both, as well assources other than sensors sometimes referred to as context insensing systems.  Inclusion of diverse information modalities offered bydisparate sources  sensors or other types  offers the potential toimprove decisionmaking performance beyond the level attainable byexploiting a single modality, and is particularly desirable in difficultdecisionmaking tasks.  However, fusion of disparate informationsources is not straightforward and remains an open research topic.Fusion of disparate and uncertain multisensor information in the settingof biodefenseoriented decisionmaking is the objective of our ongoingresearch program.  Within this program, we have proposed and aredeveloping a machineintelligence based decisionsupport architecturetermed FLASH Fusion, Learning, Adaptive SuperHybrid.  The FLASHcognitiveprocessing architecture involves multiple machinelearningand reasoning paradigms, integrated in a cohesive hybridofhybridsstructure, as discussed in our previous papers.  The current paperreports on the recent progress of the FLASH effort.  The issues arisingfrom disparate sensing modalities in a multisensor network environmentare discussed.  This includes tradeoffs involving the value of multiplicityand diversity of information sources, and the increased difficulty of therecognition problem due to the presence of such multiple sources.  Theissue of featurelevel fusion vs. decisionlevel fusion is considered.  Theuncertainty estimation problem is investigated and the techniques forgeneration of uncertainty measures are presented.  The backgroundtype determination aspect is discussed.  Results to date are presented.The investigations and results presented are in the context of thebioattack detection application.  However, the FLASH architecture andmethods discussed in the paper are also relevant to other decisionsupport domains and tasks.This material is based upon work supported by the National ScienceFoundation under Grant No. 0329901.

Zhu, Univ. of NebraskaOmaha S. OHara, M. Simon, E. R.Lindahl, 21st Century Systems, Inc.Information fusion, as a field of modern information technology, assistsmilitary commanders by automating the process of combining multiplesets of lower level data from diverse resources into a single set ofhigherlevel meaningful information that is greater than the sum of itscontributing parts for complex situation assessment and decisionmaking. To provide the US military substantially increased combatcapabilities through aligned and integrated information presentation,situation assessments, and awareness, the agentbased data fusionand decision aid system needs to know and understand therelationships among diverse sets of data and the nature of theirresources so as to combine them and produce an actionable result.However, there is a serious disparity in the way humans and automaticsystems perform the intelligence analysis and data integration tasks.For example, most computational tools for handling informationuncertainties are numeric and quantitative, whereas most humanthinking in this aspect is symbolic and qualitative. Moreover, inferencemechanisms on hybrid data sets often do not work together.Approximate inference, such as discretization, has serious limitationswhen applied to the data of geological or categorical symbols.This paper presents a system for Asymmetric Threat Detection ATDthrough fusing large amounts of heterogeneous information collections.The research particularly addresses the near realtime fusion andaggregation of multisource information by applying an interpolativeinference technique, with the goal of revealing potential threatimplications and explicitly quantifying the uncertainties of the situation.The system, called Collective Agents Interpolation Integral CAII,addresses the high level data fusion processes by combining, in amathematically sound manner, the information provided by sets ofdomain experts, called authorities. The authorities may be humanoperators, such as intelligence analysts, or software agents with anability to characterize data from various resources including sensorsautonomously. CAII can pool the judgments and evidence from a set ofdomain experts and generate a consensus opinion that reducesuncertainty and improves decisionmaking effectiveness.One difficulty in the knowledge exploration process of informationfusion is the overabundance of patterns that is, even with properstatistics, it is too easy to find many significant knowledge patterns thatare obvious, redundant, or useless. To remedy this situation, one mayfocus on the changes because obvious patterns will not change, orincorporate rulerefining methods with domain knowledge andheuristics, as well as other techniques. However, as shown in theexisting literature, to avoid the generation of too many pointlesspatterns, a simple but useful technique is to start the process byspecifying what kind of knowledge is sought. In other words, usersshould be allowed to provide criteria or some kind of taskorientedbias as the original goal to guide the direction of discovery from datasets. It is clear that to successfully address the questions the agentsystem has to be equipped with multiple models for representing thedata sets and for reasoning on the input data so as to properly evaluatethe relevant hypotheses and generate correct outputs.The use of the multi model approach in the modeling, analysis andcontrol of nonlinear complex andor illdefined systems was advocatedby many researchers. This approach supposes the definition of a set oflocal models valid in a given region or domain. Different strategies existbased on a partitioning of the nonlinear systems full range ofoperations into multiple smaller operating regimes, each of which isassociated with a locally valid model or controller. However, most ofthese strategies, which suppose the determination of these localmodels as well as their validity domain, remain arbitrary and aregenerally fixed with respect to certain a priori knowledge of the system.Meanwhile, the transition problem between the different models, whichmay use either a simple commutation or a fusion technique, is stillpending.The central problem of this research is to gather, analyze, and integratevast amount of information from diverse data resources in variousheterogeneous types and forms, and to distill from them the valuableintelligence leads or cohesions with respect to asymmetric threatdetection. Under the setting of these requirements, CAII was positionedas an intelligent inference structure that accommodates integration ofhybrid reasoning mechanisms with quantitative accounts of datacertainties and source reliabilities. Key abilities of the CAII are to gatherand combine evidences drawn from multiple sources and performchains of reasoning processes. In this structure, the results of onereasoning process are fed as input to another reasoning processinvolving a different set of hypotheses and internalexternal attributes.The incremental reasoning integration process enables more quicklyrecognizing critical situation and simultaneously evaluatingupdatingmultiple actionreaction alternatives.CAII uses a hybrid inference structure to handle the reasoning andinformation integration on disparate inputs. A major functionality of CAIIis to perform multiple levels of probabilistic reasoning formulated in amultimodel structure of inference. A goaldirected agent autonomouspattern recognition approach is applied to deal with particular reasoningprocesses, which include three basic CAII functions 1 Model definition which refers to defining the functionals and constraints of the modelsusing a priori knowledge and heuristics, 2 Model selection  whichrefers to identifying the models applicable to a given situation by usingbelief measurements such as the KullbackLeibler KL divergence andlikelihood evaluations, and 3 Model integration  which refers tocombining the results from individual models using belief combinationtechniques such as DempsterShafer theory and subjective logics toform a consolidated presentation. CAII provides the following tools andtechnologies leveraged for this effort KRShell knowledgerepresentation module, Interagent communication modules, DatabaseInterface to WordNet, VisionAgentTM autonomous video surveillancemodule, Document characterization agents, and Social Networkcharacterization agents. Agents in CAII are organized hierarchically, sothere may exist multiple levels of agent authorities where each level isan agent that applies a consensus operation on the inputs of multipleinformation sources.The paper will be organized as follows.

De Mouzon, Institut National de Recherche sur lesTransports FranceTransportation systems are motivated to obtain reliable information formonitoring and control operations.  Providing realtime trafficinformation is one of the critical issues for the success of IntelligentTransportation Systems ITS programs and becomes a major challengefor public institutions and private companies FHWA, 2003.Many ITS applications, such as Advanced Traveler Information SystemsATIS and Advanced Traffic Management Systems ATMS, have beenand are still developed in order to improve traffic performance andsafety. They mainly rely on realtime data or, more precisely, indicatorsthat are used to manage traffic flows, react on emergency cases, andinform road users. Nevertheless, most conclusions in the studies andresearches of this field point out that the weak spot of such applicationsis the poor quantity and quality of realtime data available for input.Different automatic data collection techniques are of potential use toapprehend traffic conditions and derive relevant indicators for usersinformation and guidance. The travel time is one of the forms in whichthis information is presented, and a number of systems are based on itsdissemination. This raises the problem of estimating travel times with anacceptable degree of accuracy, within multiple data configuration. As aresult, travel time estimation becomes a typical data fusion problem.This paper concentrates on data fusion for Travel time usingconventional data source and Electronic Toll Collection ETC data. Thedata fusion processes developed aim to provide a consistent andcomprehensive picture of network conditions.657121, Session 5Realtime target tracking simulations in large disparatesensor networksH. Lin, J. A. Rushing, S. J. Graves, E. A. Criswell, S. Tanner, TheUniv. of AlabamaHuntsvilleA parallelized search based data fusion algorithm for large disparatesensor networks using a simulated annealing approach is presented.The simulated networks are composed of large numbers of low fidelitybinary and bearingonly sensors, and small numbers of high fidelityposition sensors, such as radars. The disparate networks can takeadvantage of low cost and high detection precision of the primitivesensors as well as high reliability of the expensive position sensors. Theprimitive sensors provide limited information, not sufficient to locate thetargets the position sensors can report both range and direction of thetargets. The target positions are determined through fusingmeasurement information from all types of sensors. A score function,which takes into account the fidelity of sensors of different types, isdefined and used as the evaluation function during the optimizationsearch. The fusion algorithm is parallelized using spatial decompositionso the fusion process can finish before the arrival of the next sensordata. Simulations for real time target tracking are performed on a Linuxcluster with communication between nodes facilitated by the MessagePassing Interface MPI. The networks have randomly distributedhundreds of thousands of primitive sensors and a few hundreds ofposition sensors over an 800 mile by 800 mile area. The probability ofdetection POD, false alarm rate FAR, and average deviation AVD areused in evaluating the network performance. The input targetinformation for all the simulations is a set of target track data createdfrom a theater level air combat simulation.657123, Session 5Prospects for dynamic ISR tasking and interpretationbased on standing orders to sensor networksA. V. Pantaleev, J. Josephson, The Ohio State Univ.This research is intended to contribute to the development ofautomated and humanintheloop systems for higher level fusion torespond to the information requirements of command decision making.In tactical situations with short time constraints, the analysis ofinformation requirements may take place in advance for certain classesof problems, and provided to commanders and their staff as part of thecontrol and communications systems that come with sensor networks.In particular, it may be possible that certain standing orders can assumethe role of Priority Intelligence Requirements. Standing orders to asensor network are analogous to standing orders to Soldiers. TrainedSoldiers presumably dont need to be told to report contact withhostiles, for example, or to report any sighting of civilians with weapons.Such standing orders define design goals and engineering requirementsfor sensor networks and their control and inference systems. Sincesuch standing orders can be defined in advance for a class ofsituations, they minimize the need for situationspecific human analysis.Thus, standing orders should be able to drive automatic control of somenetwork functions, automated fusion of sensor reports, and automateddissemination of fused information. We define example standing orders,and outline an algorithm for responding to one of them based on ourexperience in the field of multisensor fusion.657122, Session 6Distributed fusion and tracking in multisensor systemsD. Khosla, J. Guillochon, HRL Labs., LLCThe goal of sensor fusion is to take observations of an environmentfrom multiple sources and combine them into the best possible trackpicture. For simplicity, this is usually done by sending all measurementsto a single node whose sole task is to fuse measurements into acoherent track picture. This paper introduces a new framework thatdoes not rely on a single fullawareness node to fuse observations,but rather turns every sensor into a fusion center. Moving a networkfrom a centralized to a distributed architecture complicates sensorfusion, but provides many tangible benefits. Since each sensor is both asource and a sink of information, the loss of any individual componentmeans that only one of many possible information channels has beendestroyed. In this paper, we discuss how to fuse both tracking andclassification observations in a distributed network, and compare itsperformance to a centralized framework. Each track has both akinematic state and a belief state associated with it. Components utilizethe information form of the Kalman filter for kinematic tracking, whiletarget type is determined using a hierarchical belief structure todetermine object classification, recognition, and identification. Eachcomponent in the network maintains its own independent picture of theenvironment, and information is exchanged between components via aqueued messaging system. This paper compares the performance ofcentralized architectures to distributed architectures, and theirrespective communication and computation costs.657125, Session 6Evaluating rankscore diversity to select fusionoperations for SLAMD. M. Lyons, D. F. Hsu, Fordham Univ.In this paper, we evaluate the use of a rankscore diversity measure  forselecting sensory fusion operations for a Simultaneous Localization andMapping SLAM application. It has been shown in previous work thatthis measure is a useful criterion for selecting dynamically between  ascorebased and a rankbased sensory fusion, and for selecting whichfeatures to include in the fusion,  when tracking multiple targets that canundergo mutual occlusions. Our current application involves robotmapping and navigation in an outdoor urban search and rescuesituation in which we have many similar and mutually occludinglandmarks. The robot is a 4wheel direct drive platform equipped withConf. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion Architectures,Algorithms, and Applications 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 311visual, stereo depth and ultrasound sensors. In this paper, we report anexpirement in which rankscore diversity was used to select acombination of visual input features, stereo depth information andultrasound information as input to a SLAM algorithm. We informallyreview and evaluate some of the automatic fusion operation choicesmade during the experiment, and we present a performancecomparison with use of a single, good fusion rule.657126, Session 6Maximum likelihood ensemble filter applied tomultisensor systemsA. Albayrak, M. Zupanski, D. Zupanski, Colorado State Univ.Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter MLEF is an alternativedeterministic ensemble based filter technique that optimizes a nonlinear cost function along with a Maximum Likelihood approach. Inaddition to the common use of ensembles for calculating errorcovariance, the ensembles in MLEF are exploited to efficiently calculateHessian preconditioning and the gradient of the cost function.This study is divided into two segments. The first part presents a onesensor approach, were MLEF is compared to different filters usingLorenz 63 system. These filters are Kalman Filter, Extended KalmanFilter, Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter, and Square Root EnsembleKalman Filter.The second part develops a multisensor system. Here we study amoving particle on an orbit obtained from the same Lorenz system. Weanalyze the information content of MLEFs ensemble subspace for eachsensor and consider the effects of different number of ensembles on thefusion process.In practice, when using ensemble based filtering techniques, a largeensemble size is required to obtain the best results. In this study weshow that MLEF can obtain similar results using a smaller ensemblesize by utilizing an information matrix, where essential characteristicsare captured. This is a vital consideration when working with multisensor data fusion systems.657127, Session 6Digital terrain mapping from multispectral and highresolution satellite data for defense studiesS.

The real time nature of remotelysensed data can be of high value for mapping and analyzing surfaceterrain.This paper explores the application of remote sensing analysis forterrain mapping from high and Multispectral satellite data, the accuracyof digital elevation model has been verified from various surfaceinterpolation algorithms in which contour and point interpolationtechniques were extensively used. The study reveals that digitalinterpretation has become more sharpened on a large scale and terrainmapping with high and multi spectral satellite data along with GPSMobile mapper can be done for any region, through this paper it isproved that sensor can navigate army movements.657129, Session 6Assessing the value of information in a fuzzy cognitivemapK. A. Perusich, Purdue Univ.Fuzzy cognitive maps have been used as a technique for modeling theessential relationships that exist in a multisensor, multiattribute, multidecision environment. By qualitatively capturing the key causeeffectrelationships that subject matter experts believe exist, whether harddata from a sensor or soft data from an analyst about the intent of anadversary, the map synthesizes, i.e. fuses, disparate data into usableknowledge and information about the emerging problem and the impactof various strategies on its resolution. A key feature of the inferenceprocess in a fuzzy cognitive map is that states of attributes arecompared to states of attributes, allowing a variety of different types ofdata to be incorporated seamlessly without the need for a commonmetric. In many instances, not all data will be available when aninference is made. With any architecture for multiattribute informationfusion, it is important to understand how an outcome would change ifadditional data were available. In addition, the acquisition of additionaldata normally will have a cost, in both the time involved and theadditional resources necessary, associated with it. The value ofadditional information then becomes assessing the impact it has on theoutcome versus the cost associated with acquiring it.In this paper, a technique will be presented for establishing the value ofacquiring data on attributes unavailable at the time an initial inference ismade from a fuzzy cognitive map. The technique involves three steps.In the first, an assessment is made of the reachability of unavailableattributes to the final outcomes. This involves determining whether achain of causality from the attribute of interest to the outcome ispresent. If not, the attribute of concern can not affect the outcome andcan be eliminated from further consideration. For those nodes that canaffect the outcome dominance in the chains of causality are determinedwithin the map. This is the second step in the process. If other pathsdominate the chain of interest such that the attribute can not affect theoutcome regardless of its value, then it can also be eliminated fromfurther consideration. In the final step, assuming that the cost ofacquiring the required information has been incorporated into the map,a determination is made of the value of having the additional data.657130, Session 6Sensitivity analysis of OWA operator with respect to theoptimism degreeM. Zarghaami, R. Ardakanian, Sharif Univ. of Technology Iran F.Szidarovszky, The Univ. of ArizonaThe successful design of the Ordered Weighted Averaging OWAmethod as an aggregation operator depends on the efficientcomputation of its order weights. The most popular methods fordetermining the order weights are Quantifier Guided approach and theMinimal Variability method. These methods give different behaviorpatterns for OWA. This paper compares them by using SensitivityAnalysis on the outputs of OWA with respect to the optimism degree ofthe Decision Maker. Sensitivity Analysis requires different approachesfor the different models. A case study is introduced concerning a waterresources management problem. The Quantifier Guided approach givesmore information about the behavior of the OWA outputs in comparisonto the MV method. However in using the Minimal Variability method, theOWA has a linear behavior with respect to the optimism degree andtherefore it has better computation efficiency.657131, Session 6Application of a static and dynamic united decouplingmethod for nongyro inertial measurement unitM. Ding, Q. L. Wang, C. Wang, Harbin Institute of TechnologyChinaMost current inertial measurement units IMU use linear accelerometersand gyroscopes to sense linear the acceleration and angular rate of amoving body respectively. In a nongyro inertial measurement unitNGIMU, accelerometers are not only used to acquire the linearacceleration, but also replace gyroscopes to compute the angular rateaccording to their positions in threedimension space. NGIMU has theadvantages of antihigh g value shock, low power consumption, smallvolume and low cost. It can be applied to some specific occasions suchas tactic missiles, intelligent bombs and so on.Many scholars studied this technique deeply and acquired many fruitfulachievements. They proposed many accelerometer configurations,Conf. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion Architectures,Algorithms, and Applications 2007312 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssalgorithms and practical analysis. But few of them studied the couplingproblem of the system, and also none of the static and dynamicdecoupling methods is reported. A generalized definition of the couplingerror is that the response of an actuation includes the additionalinformation about the other actuation which would not affect theresponse. In a NGIMU system, the coupling error defines that theoutput of a singleaxis accelerometer contains the additionalinformation of other accelerometer in other direction. The coupling erroris mainly arisen from the reasons of the location deviation of the sensingelement in the accelerometer, the location deviation of theaccelerometer in the design and the low manufacture level of the rigidbody.Also, when a NGIMU system is working, the static coupling error andthe dynamic coupling error all exist. That is to say, the accelerometeroutput signal is coupled by not only the static signal but also thedynamic signal. The general decoupling treatment method is first to usethe static decoupling to the accelerometer, and then the dynamicdecoupling. The process is sequential, and the static decouplingmethod and the dynamic decoupling method make up of a serialnetwork. This network makes the accelerometer signal processingcomplex to some extent.In this paper, basing on a nineaccelerometer configuration of NGIMUand the definition of the coupling error, a new static and dynamic uniteddecoupling method is applied to NGIMU. The method overcomes thecomplexity, which is aroused by using the static decoupling methodand dynamic coupling method respectively, and simplifies the followingprocessing system. Finally, a simulation case for estimating the error ofthe angular rate in three axes is investigated. The simulation resultsshow that after the static and dynamic decoupling, the navigationprecision is improved effectively. In addition, the method can be easilyto extend to the coupling situation of many dimensions such as thesituation that three accelerometers with different sensing directions arelocated at one point.657133, Poster SessionMultisensor fusion of images for target identificationA. Muthukumar, G. Anitha, J. Shanmugam, Madras Institute ofTechnology IndiaMultisensor data fusion is an emerging technology applied to defenseand nondefense applications. In this paper, a image fusion algorithmusing different texture parameters is proposed to identify longrangetargets. The method uses a semisupervised approach for detectingsingle target from the input images. The procedure consists of threesteps Feature extraction, Feature level fusion and Sensor level fusion.In this study, two methods of texture feature extraction using cooccurrence matrix and runlength matrix are considered. Textureparameters are calculated at each pixel of the selected training image,and target nontarget pixels identified manually. Some of the texturefeatures calculated at the target position differ from those in thebackground. Discriminant analysis is used to perform feature levelfusion on the training image, which classify target and nontarget pixels.By applying the discriminant function to the feature space of texturalparameters, a new image is created. The maxima of this imagecorrespond to target point. The same discriminant function can beapplied to the other images for detecting the trained targets regions.Sensor level fusion combines images obtained from feature level fusionof visual and IR images. The method was first tested with syntheticallygenerated images and then with real images. Results are obtained usingboth cooccurrence and runlength method of texture feature extractionfor target identification.Conf. 6571 Multisensor, Multisource Information Fusion Architectures,Algorithms, and Applications 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 313Conf. 6572 Enabling Photonic Technologies for Defense, Security, andAerospace Applications IIIMondayTuesday 910 April 2007Part of Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 6572 Enabling Photonics Technologies for Defense,Security, and Aerospace Applications III657201, Session 1DSPenabled coherent optical communicationsG. Goldfarb, G. Li, College of Optics  PhotonicsUniv. of CentralFloridaDigital Signal Processing has recently been used in conjunction withhomodyne phase diversity receivers to allow demodulation of variousmodulation formats. Digital signal processing allows laser phase noiseestimation thus avoiding the need for a phaselockedloop. Moreover,finiteinfinite impulse response filters may be used to provide firstorderchromatic dispersion compensation. The different techniques used forphase noise tracking and dispersion compensation are presented in thispaper.

Mohr, D. A. Becker, A. M. Joshi, DiscoverySemiconductors, Inc.Recently, there has been a renewed interest in coherent opticaldetection. The reasons for this are a coherent optical receivers achievehigh receiver sensitivities b multilevel modulation formats can bedetected very efficiently c optical WDM systems with high spectralefficiency can be implemented and d preservation of the optical phaseallows electrical equalizers to efficiently compensate optical channelimpairments. These advantages of coherent optical detection overdirect detection can be used to overcome some of the obstacles thatlimit the data capacity and the reach of current direct detectionsystems, both fiber and freespace based.The essential part of the coherent optical receiver is the optical localoscillator LO laser. It has to provide a high optical output power withlow linewidth and low relative intensity noise RIN. With a widelytunable LO laser a frequencyagile receiver can be constructed.To determine the best candidates for tunable LO lasers, different lasertechnologies are discussed in terms of output power, power variation,electrical power dissipation, switching time, control leads, packagedimensions, tuning range, linewidth and RIN.A heterodyne receiver to detect 10 Gbs signals has been implementedwith a standard distributed feed back DFB laser. Upgrades of thecoherent receiver with a widely tunable LO will be presented.Experimental comparison of the LO lasers and their impact on thereceiver sensitivity will be shown.657204, Session 1Alloptical phase and amplitude regeneration of phaseshift keyed signalsK. A. Croussore, G. Li, College of Optics  PhotonicsUniv. ofCentral FloridaAlloptical regeneration of phaseshift keyed PSK signals is describedtheoretically and demonstrated experimentally. Differential phaseshiftkeyed DPSK signals can be processed with phasesensitive amplifiersPSAs based on either 2nd or 3rd order optical nonlinearities.Simulations predict, and experiments confirm these devices are capableof providing simultaneous phaseandamplitude regeneration. Theimprovement in both amplitude and phase noise properties by PSAbased regeneration is analyzed for various device architectures. Higherorder PSK signals such as quadrature phaseshift keying QPSK cannot be processed with conventional PSAs, since these will inherentlydestroy information encoded in the quadraturephases. Theamplification and regeneration of these formats using novel forms ofphasesensitive amplification is therefore studied theoretically andthrough numerical simulations, using QPSK as an example.657205, Session 11310 nm WDM transmission of differential phaseshiftkeying DPSK signals using semiconductor opticalamplifiersX.

Villa, Univ. of Connecticut M. J. Hayduk, R. J. Bussjaeger, AirForce Research Lab. E. J. Donkor, Univ. of ConnecticutWe demonstrate a novel scheme for optoelectronic analogtodigitalconverters based on a parallel connection of single decimation electrooptical stages. A single decimation stage consists of a selfsynchronizeroptical circuit that uses a main optical clock optical pulses to generatethree optical signals a primary optical signal having a repetition rate f,and two secondary optical signals each having a repetition rate of f2.One of the secondary signals is in phase with the even optical pulses ofthe primary signal, whereas the other secondary signal is also in phasewith the odd pulses of the primary signal.  The primary signal is used tosample the RF input signal to generate an electrical sampled signal withsampling rate of f. Thereafter, the two secondary optical signals areused to further sample the odd and even pulses of the sampled RFsignal. This second sampled step fold down the sampling rate to f2,and relax the speed requirements for the quantizers. By connectingsuch single stages in parallel and then delaying the main optical clockpulses relative to each one, we are able to switch an array of reversebias photodiodes to generate a group of polypahse sampled signalsthat are in turn fed to interleaving electronics quantizers.In this way Our scheme can currently achieve sampling rates of up to40 GHz with a relaxed quantization rate of 5GHz for interleavingelectronic quantizers. Experimental results for 8 bits of resolutionquatizers were obtained.314 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssConf. 6572 Enabling Photonic Technologies for Defense, Security, andAerospace Applications III657207, Session 2Programmable microwave transversal filter usingacoustooptic tunable filteringF.

Bussjaeger, AFRL R. K. Erdmann,M. L. Fanto, M. J. Hayduk, J. E. Malowicki, Air Force Research Lab.This paper presents the optical implementation of a new method fordynamic, adaptive control of a microwave phased array antenna. It iswell established that optical signal processing methods provide theantenna array designer with unique capabilities generally not availableusing conventional microwave techniques. When compared with an allmicrowave approach, the utilization of optical components, especiallythe incorporation of low loss optical fiber, can provide significantreduction in the size and weight of the system as well as providing ahigh degree of immunity to electromagnetic interference EMI andelectromagnetic pulse EMP effects making them attractive for use withsecure communications and in electromagnetically rich environments.More importantly, however, the extremely broad microwave bandwidthgenerally associated with photonic systems allows for antenna controland processing with RFmicrowave bandwidths that are unobtainableusing allmicrowave processing.Most beamforming systems extant, opticallybased or otherwise fallinto one of two categories delayandsum beamforming or Fourierbased beamforming. Problem posed by these systems include an apriori knowledge of the exact position of where one wishes to steer thearray, precisely specified stable antenna array locations, difficulty inspecifying and generating antenna stable nulls to counteract the effectof interference, and very significantly the inability to account for howatmospheric effects influence array control. This paper examines whatcan be viewed as a paradigm shift in array beamforming with itsassociated optical implementation. First, an RF pulse is transmittedfrom any one array element, with all other elements set to operate in thereceive mode. The backscattered signals from the desired location iscaptured by each array element and is then used to modulate a pulsedlaser source. An electrooptic switch acts as a time gate that caneliminate any unwanted signals such as those reflected from othertargets whose range is different from that of the desired transmitreceivelocation. A chromatic dispersion processor is used to extract the exactarray parameters of the received signal location. Hence, other than anapproximate knowledge of the steering direction, needed only toapproximately establish the time gating, no knowledge of the targetssposition, and hence no knowledge of the array element time delay isrequired. The process is repeated at a rate determined by the repetitionrate of the pulsed laser source. Target andor array elements motion isautomatically accounted for in the adaptation process while alsoautomatically compensating for atmospheric aberrations.This paper will present the details of the photonic processor, analyticaljustification, and simulated as well as preliminary experimental results.The operation of the system with application to microwave arrayantennas, laser radar, and arbitrary waveform generation will bepresented.657209, Session 3Chirp control via differential pumping of a monolithicpassively mode locked quantum dot laserK. C. Brown, B. Wysocki, M. L. Fanto, J. E. Malowicki, Air ForceResearch Lab.A monolithic two section quantum dot semiconductor laser isdifferentially pumped creating nonuniform current injection in the gainregion. We show that the type and amount of chirp in the output signalcan be controlled using this differential pumping method, despite thefact the separately pumped gain regions are not electrically isolated inthis device.  Both negative redshift and positive blue shift frequencychirps were observed during modelocked operation and their effectson pulse duration and peak power are analyzed. In addition, it isdemonstrated that mode locked operation under an expanded set ofinjection current and absorber bias voltage pairs are possible whichwere previously not available with single pad current injection.657210, Session 3Low noise, optical frequency stabilized, semiconductorbased frequency comb source for coherentcommunication and signal processingF.

Wysocki, T.McEwen, Air Force Research Lab.Generation of stable pulses and a frequency stabilized optical comb aretwo key requirements for Fourier Based Arbitrary Waveform GenerationAWG techniques.  The longitudinal mode spacing of the laser mustremain as stable as possible to permit effective isolation and processingof the modes for waveform synthesis.  The short and long termtemporal stability ultimately limit the systems precision as well as itsoperability in fielded systems.  A packaged erbiumdoped waveguideprovided a highly compact gain medium for the harmonically modelocked laser design. Stability was achieved by use of an intracavityetalon for frequency stabilization of the optical comb, a PoundDreverHall PDH method, and an active bias feedback loop for low frequencynoise suppression. The temperature was controlled to limit cavity lengthvariation, and the contribution to stability of each method isquantitatively assessed. The systems stable operating time wasincreased from hours to days, and the timing jitter is demonstrated tobe lower than that of commercially available erbiumdoped fiber laserEDFL systems.

Mohseni, O. G. Memis, S. Kong, A. Katsnelson, NorthwesternUniv. S. Zhang, N. Jin, I. Adesida, Univ. of Illinois at UrbanaChampaignWe present the latest performance of our novel Focalized CarrierAugmented Sensor FOCUS. The principal operation of this device isinspired from the eyes rod cell, and involves compression of photogenerated charges into a nanometer size injector. The device is basedon InP material system, and is processed using conventional ebeamand photolithography, dryetching, metallization and planarizationtechniques. The large change of potential that is resulted from thecondensed charge in the nanoinjector leads to a significant change ofthe injected current. Therefore, the device shows a very high gain at lowbias values of around 1 volt. Unlike avalanche photodiodes, theabsence of the bicarrier gain eliminates excess noise in FOCUS, andthe device shows shotnoise limited performance. Also, the absence ofavalanche multiplication makes the recovery time of FOCUS muchfaster than the avalanche photodiodes. We could measure aninstrument limited recovery time of a few nanoseconds that is morethan three orders of magnitude shorter than conventional avalanchesingle photon detectors.657215, Session 4InGaAsP avalanche photodetectors for nongated 1.06um photoncounting receiversM. A. Itzler, X. Jiang, R. BenMichael, K. Slomkowski, PrincetonLightwave Inc. M. A. Krainak, S. Wu, X. Sun, NASA Goddard SpaceFlight Ctr.The efficient detection of single photons at 1.06 um is of considerableinterest for lidarladar systems designed for remote sensing and rangingas well as for freespace optical transmission in photonstarvedapplications.  However, siliconbased single photon avalanche diodesSPADs used at shorter wavelengths have very low single photondetection efficiency 1  2 at 1.06 um, while InPInGaAs SPADsdesigned for telecommunications wavelengths near 1.5 um exhibit darkcount rates that generally inhibit nongated freerunning operation.  Tobridge this single photon detection gap for wavelengths just beyond 1um, we have developed high performance, large area 80  200 umdiameter InPbased InGaAsP quaternary absorber SPADs optimized foroperation at 1.06 um and based on a highly reliable planar geometryavalanche photodiode structure.  We will show that dark count rates aresufficiently low to allow for nongated operation while achievingdetection efficiencies far surpassing those found for Si SPADs.  At adetection efficiency of 10, 80 um diameter devices exhibit dark countrates below 1000 Hz and photon counting rates exceeding 1 MHz whenoperated at 40 C.  Significantly higher detection efficiencies 30  50are achievable with acceptable tradeoffs in dark count rate.  In thispaper, we will also discuss performance modeling for these devices andcompare their behavior with longer wavelength 1.5 um InPbasedInGaAs ternary absorber SPADs fabricated on a related device designplatform.657216, Session 4Linearmode single photon counting APD arrays withsubnanosecond, afterpulse free performance for ladar,spectroscopy  QKD applicationsL.

Foshee, Air Force Research Lab.Long range ladar, spectroscopy and quantum key distribution systemsrequire single photon photoreceivers with subnanosecond and real timeperformance free of afterpulsing to meet the stringent requirements forlong range, high count efficiency and high sensitivity. Currently availablesingle photon detectors are either incapable of subnanosecond photoncounting, have low quantum efficiency andor have poor reliability. Forexample, Geiger mode APDs can at best count single photons in longpulse durations and are not capable of multiple counts between resets.In addition, other types of photoreceivers, have the drawback ofrelatively large size, weight and power, high deployment costs and poorreliability, which make them unsuitable for DoD platforms such as UAVsand missiles.Epitaxial Technologies has developed a single photon countingphotoreceiver that can operate in the linear mode to avoid thedrawbacks of Geiger mode detectors. The Companys linear singlephoton counting photoreceiver array technology is based on cascadingoptical amplifiers onchip with APDs to enable single photon capabilitybelow the APD breakdown voltage through ultralow noise gain andpreamplification. We have already demonstrated components for thisphotoreceiver that when implemented will have single photonsensitivities for subnanosecond pulses with high photon countingefficiency and without afterpulsing at 1064 and 1550nm.This paper will describe the implementation and the characteristics ofthe photoreceiver . Details, including system concepts, photoreceiverarchitecture, design, implementation, and performance data will bepresented.

S. Guilfoyle, D. A. Louderback, K. Yang, K. M. Patel, X. Jin, J.Cheng, OptiComp Corp.The demand for bandwidth and interconnectivity in aerospace andother defense networks and systems continues to expand.  To meet thisdemand while still satisfying the unique requirements of these systems,innovative approaches are needed.  For future networks to meet thesegoals, they will need to have high bandwidths that are scalable to therequirements of particular applications.  In addition, the networks needto be very fault tolerant, protocol independent, nonblocking, lowlatency, and have low power consumption and small size.  OptiCompCorporation has developed a unique network architecture where thehardware is distributed across the network, allowing the network to beself routing and highly fault tolerant.  This network architecture isenabled by OptiComps integrated optoelectronic technologiesincluding waveguide coupled VCSELs and detectors, compact WDM,SOAs, and hybrid integration.Waveguide grating couplers that enable a VCSEL to be coupledbidirectionally into an internal waveguide and allow a portion of the lightin a waveguide to be tapped off to a detector comprise the core ofOptiComps integrated optoelectronics.  This onchip coupling into andout of a waveguide enables coarse WDM multiplexing anddemultiplexing to be accomplished in a very small area with noadditional packaging, making the structure more compact and rugged.Waveguide coupled device results will be presented, including highspeed data transmission between waveguide coupled VCSELs anddetectors.  Preliminary results on waveguide coupled WDMcomponents will also be discussed.

In this work a modified3D nonlinear Schrdinger equation for the pulse propagation coupledto a rate equation for the plasma density in the dielectric material isused to simulate pulse propagation and plasma formation in a range ofdielectric materials.  We use these simulations to analyze the influenceof pulsewidth, pulseshape and beam geometry on the formation of theelectron plasma and hence damage in the bulk material.  In particular,when possible, we simulate the effect of pulses reconstructed fromexperimental data.  It is expected that a better understanding of thedynamics of laserinduced plasma generation will enable the accuratesimulation of optical damage in a variety of dielectrics, ultimatelyleading to an enhanced control of optical damage to real materials andoptical devices.657227, Poster SessionPulse shape effects on the measurement of temperatureusing a Brillouinbased optical fiber sensorC.

A device or a new configurationthat could achieve a larger distance andor a better spatial resolution isa topic of special interest in the distributed fiber sensing field. Due tothis situation, in this paper it is presented the influence of the probepulse shape in the interaction between the pulsed light and thecontinuous wave laser in a pumpprobe system with the purpose ofimproving the spatial resolution of the measurement without losingstability in the BGS measured.  It is also showed how thebackscattering Brillouin gain is affected by inducing variations on thefinal value of the BGS intensity measurements. This effect is illustratedby using an experimental set up based on the Brillouin optical timedomain analysis BOTDA.

The fiber wasextruded from a preform with 18 inserted rods of lower refractive indexthat form two ring structure in a hexagonal pattern.  The fiber core sizewas approximately 79 m. Both experimental and theoretical evidencesare presented to establish that the fiber is effectively singlemode atwavelength 10.6 m with numerical aperture NA  0.16. The near fieldand far field mode distributions showed no evidence of the structureassociated with higherorder modes. Optical losses measured by cutback method were  2 dBm . Crystalline microstructured optical fibersoffer key advantages over stepindex optical fibers from silver halidecrystals because they may be designed polarizationmaintaining andwith large mode field area.  Silver halide crystals have the widetransmission range of wavelengths 220 m, so microstructuredcrystalline fibers have strong potential for power delivery of CO2 andquantum cascade lasers QCL to inaccessible places giving anopportunity to develop laserbased infrared sensor systems that willhave improved performance with reduced weight, volume and powerconsumption.

Tollaksen, George Mason Univ.This article focuses on timeextended properties that quantummechanics represents as existing at a given moment, but which cannotbe measured at a given moment.Several novel examples are presented in which energy cannot bemeasured in a short time.  The essence of these examples is an attemptto  measure the momenta or the energy of an ideal quantum clock byhaving an interaction that lasts only a short time, where this short timeis defined with respect to the internal time  which is conjugate to thismomenta.  However, this momenta and this time cannot both bedefinite at once. Nevertheless, the momenta can be definite at a definiteexternal parameter time, rather than this internal time. From the internalperspective, however, it is shown that the energy cannot be defined at agiven internal time and therefore, this aspect of timeextension iscompletely quantum in origin, unlike the classical aspect of energy isfrequency.An additional consequence of time extended properties is that theuncertainty is increased for the internal time before and after the energymeasurement.  This suggests that the complementarity between energyand time is deeper than the notion that precise measurements of energytake a long time.Going beyond the negative statements about what cannot bemeasured which characterize most of the discussions of the energytime uncertainty relation,  a positive aspect of Delta E Delta t   1 isdemonstrated in a closed system based on causality.  This positiveaspect is related to a general approach for discovering efficientquantum algorithms by optimizing paths in Hilbert Space.657338, Poster SessionSpeaking of sensing in the language of quantummechanicsJ.

Chong, Univ. of CaliforniaSanta BarbaraOne of the central challenges that remains for the realization of a largescale ion trap quantum computer is the modeling and engineering ofthe interfaces between the large number of physical ions qubitcontainers in the computer and the classical apparatus that controlsthem. A critical highdensity interface is the ionmotionpath, where anelectric signal to the electrodes that trap ions controls the ballisticmotion of the individual ions and hence the transport of quantuminformation across the chip. Largescale ion trap geometries arecomposed of millions of ions trapped in spatially multiplexed trap arraysand may not be able to provide the desired density and access of theclassical control circuitry  which orchestrates the complex pulsesequences needed to move each ion. In this paper we use traditionalcompilerbased techniques to model the scheduling of a multiplexedion trap design to better match the density of the control electronicswith the needed ion density defined as ionsperunitarea  for theindividual components of a largescale chip. More specifically, we adaptthe existing Quantum Physical Operations Scheduler QPOS and builda library of maximally parallelized ionmotion patterns required for thefunctionality of the individual chip components such as memory unitsthat employ concatenated quantum error correcting codes andcomputational units where logical operations and teleportation areperformed. The motion path library is constructed such that the numberof different voltage pulses is minimized and voltages are distributed in aprogrammed manner such that density constraints on the classicalcontrol circuitry are minimized. Such an optimization approach allowsour scheduling algorithm to aid the design of dense iontrap structureswith close to minimal classical control overhead for any given quantumcircuit including memory components that require complex errorcorrection procedures. spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 319657304, Session 1Scattering theory in relation to quantum computingJ.

Kaltchenko, Wilfrid Laurier Univ. CanadaBACKGROUNDThe scaling1 of NMR ensemble computers is currently one of themain obstacles to building largerscale quantum computing  devices. Toachieve scalability, one needs a large number of  highly polarized spinsin liquid nuclearspin systems at finite  temperature. In quantumcomputing terminology, such spinhalf  states are almost pure qubitstates. Producing highly polarized  spins almost pure qubit states outof nonpolarized spins  nonpure qubit states is sometimes calledpurification. From  a thermodynamic point of view, purification can beviewed as  cooling spins to a very low temperature.PREVIOUS RESULTSA compressionbased algorithmic cooling via polarization heat  bathwas proposed in 1 and implemented in 2. A compression  subroutineused in 1,2 is capable of producing m pure qubits  out of n nonpurequbits, where m is upperbounded by the  expression n1  H12 eps2  . Here H. is the binary  entropy function, and eps arises from thequbits density matrix  as follows. The qubit state is given by a diagonal2x2 matrix  with the diagonal elements 1eps2 and 1eps2.The improved compression subroutine was introduced in 3 and atradeoff between the number of cooled spins and the closeness of  theirquantum state to the ideal pure state was studied. The main  result of3 was a lower bound on the probability of cooled  spins to be purestates for large n.OUR CONTRIBUTIONIn this work, we extend the results of 3 as follows. First, we  obtain theprobability distribution of cooled spins as a function  of n, m, and epsfor all, not necessarily large, n. Second, we  analyze how the mismatchthe algorithms computational basis and  the actual eigenbasis of thequbits density matrix will affect  the cooling purification performance.REFERENCES1 P.

Yepez, Air Force Research Lab.A variety of physically relevant quantum lattice gas systems have beenrecently developed by us, and these systems have emergent nonlineareffective field theories governing the timedependent dynamicalbehavior of the long wavelength modes in the quantum system.Satisfying the dual purposes of computational physics and quantumcomputation, these numerical quantum algorithms are unitary modelsuseful for numerically predicting the timedependent solutions ofnonlinear partial differential equations, including the Korteveg deVriesKdV equation, a reduced set of magnetohydrodynamic MHDequations, and various forms of the nonlinear Schroedinger NLSequation, including the Manakov equations for optical solitons and nowthe GrossPitaeskii GP equation for BoseEinstein condensatesBECs.  Here, the quantum lattice gas algorithm is demonstrated to bea practical model of the GP equation for cold atomic gases in the BECground state.  In our quantum latticegas algorithm, the quantum wavefunction of a manybody system of quantum particles is resolved on acomputational grid usually a Bravais lattice.  The finite grid size of thelattice provides a cutoff regulation to the quantum theory, stabilizingthe model by removing high kmodes.  The evolution operatorgoverning the timedependent behavior of the wave function is cast asthe product of three unitary operators locally applied in timestepfashion 1 a homogeneous stream operator for the sitetosite hoppingof the particles, 2 a homogeneous  collision operator for the onsiteparticleparticle interactions, and 3  an inhomogeneous gaugeoperator for particlefield interactions.  With the first two spatiallyindependent homogeneously applied stream and collide operatorsalone, we recover linear quantum theories, both nonrelativistic andrelativistic theories.   The spatially dependent inhomogeneouslyapplied gauge operation allows us to go much further to modelnonlinear quantum systems manybody dynamics in an externalpotential and an internally generated potential.   Consequently, we findthe quantum lattice gas algorithm is well suited to modeling the manybody physics of atomic BECs.

Ghoshal, R. B. Gomez, George Mason Univ. M. O. Lanzagorta,Naval Research Lab. J. K. Uhlmann, Univ. of MissouriColumbiaSome of our previous research showed some interesting resultsregarding the effect of nonzero temperature on a specified quantumcomputation. For example, our analysis revealed that more Groveriterations are required to amplify the amplitude of the solution in aquantum search problem when the system is found at some finitetemperature. We will present a further study on the effects oftemperature on quantum entanglement using a finite temperature fieldtheoretical description. Such a framework could prove to be useful forthe understanding of computational dynamics inside a quantumcomputer.

E. Korepin, Stony Brook Univ.Searching and sorting algorithms enters as a subroutine in manyimportant algorithms. Quantum algorithm can find a target item in adatabase faster than any classical algorithm. One can trade accuracyfor speed and find a part of the database a block containing the targetitem even faster, this is partial search. An example is the followingexact address of the target item is given by a sequence of many bits,but we need to know only some of them. More generally partial searchconsiders the following problem a database is separated into  several blocks. We want to find a block with the target item, not the target itemitself. Partial search was introduced by Mark Heiligman. A partial searchalgorithm was recently suggested by Grover and Radhakrishnan, itworks faster then classical partial search. The author optimized it.Complexity of a search algorithm is measured by number of queries tothe oracle. The author suggests a new version of GroverRadhakrishnanalgorithm which uses minimal number of queries to the oracle. Theauthor also designed partial search in a database with several targetitems. The algorithm can run on the same hardware which is used forthe usual Grover algorithm.657312, Session 3Quantum algorithms for optimal graph traversalsproblemsS. Doern, Univ. Ulm GermanyQuantum algorithms have the potential to demonstrate that for someproblems quantum is more efficiently than classical computation. Thestudy of the quantum complexity for graph problems is a new area inquantum computing. Only for a few graph problems quantumalgorithms are known. The first optimal quantum algorithms for graphproblems were presented by Duerr et al. 2004 for minimum spanningtree, graph connectivity, strong graph connectivity and for the singlesource shortest paths problem. Magniez et al. 2005 constructed aquantum query algorithm for finding a triangle in a graph. Ambainis andSpalek 2006 presented some polynomial time quantum algorithms forcomputing a maximum matching in a bipartite graph and for thenetwork flow problem. We study the complexity of algorithms for graphtraversals problems on quantum computers. More precise, we look ateulerian tour, postman tour, hamiltonian tour, traveling salesmanproblem and project scheduling. We present quantum algorithms andquantum lower bounds for these problems. Our results improve the bestclassical algorithms for the corresponding problems. For the proofs ofour results, we using several techniques Grover search, quantum walksand the quantum running time analysis of classical algorithms.

This method allows the construction ofmachines recognizing a language with bounded error, given analgorithm whose error is not bounded away from 12 for recognizingthat language. A sample construction for such a case is inspected indetail. Using this technique, we construct a 2QFA with equal errorprobability and better state complexity compared to a wellknown 2QFAin the literature for the same language.657314, Session 3Quantum query algorithms for certain functions andgeneral algorithm construction techniquesA. Dubrovska, Latvijas Univ. LatviaQuantum algorithms can be analyzed in a query model to computeBoolean functions where input is given by a black box, but the aim is tocompute function value for arbitrary input using as few queries aspossible.Many authors have studied complexity of quantum query algorithmsand there are a lot of theoretical results regarding various complexitybounds unfortunately, there still are very few examples of quantumalgorithms provided for specific Boolean functions to illustratetheoretical evaluation of the complexity.The main aim of our research was to find new impressive algorithmsand develop general algorithm construction techniques.We have started from 3 and 4 variable functions and succeeded inutilizing quantum parallelism and interference to obtain a gap of 3 vs. 2and 4 vs. 2 queries between classical deterministic and quantum exactalgorithm complexity. Next we used the power of symmetry to extendresults to two sets of functions S3 and S4, where for each function weare able to demonstrate complete exact quantum query algorithmwhich saves the same 1 and 2 queries comparing to best possibleclassical algorithm.To obtain next result we utilized quantum parallelism once again andreceived another two sets of 6variable functions 16 functions in each,where each function can be computed by quantum algorithm withprobability 34 using only 2 queries. Next result  set of functions withclassical query complexity 8, but we can compute them in quantumsettings with the same probability 34 and 2 questions.Finally, we formulate several properties of quantum query algorithmsand introduce general algorithm transformation algorithms, whichallow to construct efficient algorithms with boundederror for complexfunctions using existing exact algorithms for subfunctions.657315, Session 3Information theoretic analysis of the Grover algorithmusing generalized statisticsR. C. Venkatesan, Systems Research Corp. IndiaThe Grover algorithm is studied within the framework of the generalizednonextensive statistics theory of Tsallis. The Grover algorithm employstwo kind of unitary operators to operate on the joint state of the targetand the computer. These are the oracle and nonoracle inversion aboutthe means operators. All operators, oracle and nonoracle, preserve theentropy both extensive and nonextensive of the joint state. Informationtransfer in the Grover iteration is primarily a consequence of oracle callson the computer state. Specifically, identifying the target is posed as aproblem of determining the unitary operators that have the ability totransfer information from the target state to the computer state. This isaccomplished via the formulation of an eigenvalue problem, utilizing theFano inequality and the Holevo bound, expressed within the frameworkof generalized statistics.

M. Bednar, Air Force Research Lab.Quantum information processings objective is to utilize revolutionarycomputing capability based on harnessing the paradigm shift offered byquantum computing to solve classically hard and computationallychallenging problems.  Some of our computationally challengingproblems of interest include the promises for rapid image processing,rapid optimization of logistics, protecting information, secure distributedsimulation, and massively parallel computation.  The implementation ofquantum computers is difficult to realize due to poor scalability andgreat presence of errors.  Therefore, we supported the development ofQuantum eXpress and QuIDD Pro, two quantum computer simulatorsrunning on classical computers for the development and testing of newquantum algorithms and processes.  This paper contrasts differentmethods used by these two quantum computing simulators.  Bothsimulators are reviewed, highlighting each simulators background,interface, and special features.

A. Jaroszkiewicz, The Univ. of Nottingham United KingdomWe present a formalism in which quantum optics experiments ofarbitrary complexity are described in terms of timedependent networksof quantum bits, each qubit representing an elementary informationgateway. The emphasis here is on the signal properties of theapparatus, rather than on the photons being observed. The quantumstates of the theory, the labstates, represent the observers descriptionof the apparatus rather than the photons. This gives a differentconceptual interpretation of quantum processes. The formalism givesan efficient quantum register description strongly related to theformalism of quantum computation. Experiments conventionallydescribed by the PVM and POVM formalisms are treated in identicalterms.There are several advantages in this formalism, one of which is that itprovides an efficient modular approach to quantum optics experiments.Quantum optics experiments of arbitrary complexity can besystematically simulated by series of qubit networks connected inseries andor in parallel. We will discuss the  possibility of encoding ourformalism into a computer algebra package such as MAPLE, whichshould provide a method of performing quantum calculations forquantum optics circuits of unlimited size and unbounded complexity.657319, Session 4Recent MITRE research in quantum sensorsG.

Tollaksen, George Mason Univ.Weak values are the outcomes of weak measurements and werediscovered by studying the timesymmetric aspects of quantummechanics.  This resulted in rich new areas of physics such as thequantum random walk, new approaches to quantum cryptography andnew resources for quantum information. In this article, new nonstatistical aspects of weak measurements are introduced including themost general way to obtain an ensemble on a single system but overtime.  I.e.  a single system is preselected, a weak measurement isperformed, a complementary postselection is performed and thenanother weak measurement is performed using the same device as inthe first weak measurement.  When this is repeated on the same singlesystem, then the measuring device can robustly  yield eccentric weakvalues that are outside the range of eigenvalues.  Contary to pastresults, this outcome is  not rare, suggesting that weak values are aproperty of every individual preandpostselected system.  Finally, it isshown how generic electromagnetic interactions are themselves weakmeasurements and thus automatically record these eccentric weakvalues.657320, Session 5On the security of the Y00 or alphaeta protocolH.

C. Venkatesan, Systems Research Corp. IndiaA systematic strategy to secure covert information code via unitaryprojections into the null spaces of illconditioned eigenstructures of ahierarchy of host statistical distributions, inferred from incompleteconstraints, is presented.   The security of the encryptiondecryptionstrategy is based on the extreme instability of the encoding process.The host pdfs are inferred using the Fisher information as the measureof uncertainty.The process of achieving encryption of covert information with the aidof unitary projections extends previous work in this area 1, 2.   Thehost density reconstruction is governed by a time independentSchrdingerlike equation TISLE.  The TISLE possesses an empiricalpseudopotential characterized by Lagrange multipliers, that aredetermined from a Fisher game. The hierarchy of statistical hostscorrespond to multiple energy states of the TISLE, when solved as aneigenvalue problem.The above extensive model is extended to the case of Tsallisnonextensive statistics, where the governing equation is a nonextensiveTISLE.  A methodology to amalgamate the statistical encryption modelswith a quantum mechanical connotation with existing quantum keydistribution protocols, in order to achieve a selfconsistent hybridstatisticalquantum mechanical cryptosystem using a shared keyconcept, is described for both symmetric and asymmetriccryptography.   Numerical examples exemplify the efficacy of themodels.References1. R. C. Venkatesan, Statistical Encryption of Covert Information intoMultiple Statistical Distributions, To appear, Phys. Lett.

Naqvi, Ctr. of Excellence in Information and CommunicationTechnologies Belgium M. Riguidel, cole Nationale Suprieure desTlcommunications FranceCryptology and information security are set to play a more prominentrole in the near future. In this regard, quantum communication andcryptography offer new opportunities to tackle ICT security. QuantumInformation Processing and Communication QIPC is a scientific fieldwhere new conceptual foundations and techniques are beingdeveloped. They promise to play an important role in the future ofinformation Security. It is thus essential to have a crossfertilizingdevelopment between quantum technology and cryptology in order toaddress the security challenges of the emerging quantum era.In this article, we discuss the impact of quantum technology on thecurrent as well as future cryptotechniques. We then analyse theassumptions on which quantum computers may operate. Then wepresent our vision for the distribution of security attributes using a novelform of trust based on Heisenbergs uncertainty and, building highlysecure quantum networks based on the clear transmission of singlephotons andor bundles of photons able to withstand unauthorizedreading as a result of secure protocols based on the observations ofquantum mechanics. We argue how quantum cryptographic systemsneed to be developed that can take advantage of the laws of physics toprovide longterm security based on solid assumptions. This requires astructured integration effort to deploy quantum technologies within theexisting security infrastructure. Finally, we conclude that classicalcryptographic techniques need to be redesigned and upgraded in viewof the growing threat of cryptanalytic attacks posed by quantuminformation processing devices leading to the development of postquantum cryptography.NB This research is supported by the European Commission fundedproject SECOQC Secure Communication based on QuantumCryptography under reference number IST2002506813.

Wang, Univ. ofConnecticutWe demonstrate the implementation and operation of a multiuser QKDsystem using a bus topology that spans a total distance of 31 km ofstandard telecomgrade optical fiber. The QKD system is based on thetwoway autocompensating scheme and employs the BB84 protocolto allow a network server to establish a secure encryption key with fiveother users on the network at a time. The values of the quantum keyssent by the network server are encoded onto the phase states of highlyattenuated  pulses, with mean photon number 0.1. These pulses aregenerated by modulating a wavelengthtunable continuous wave CWlaser light using an electrooptic modulator, and detected usingavalanche single photon detectors cooled to a temperature of 55 oCand operating in the Geiger mode. Every user on the network isallocated a unique address wavelength channel in the Cband region forcommunication with the network server. Commercial adddropmultiplexer modules OADM perform the necessary photon routing tothe users. These modules transmit photons with the matchingwavelength to the intended recipient and reflects photons at all otherwavelengths onward along the fiber. In this way, the network server isable to selectively address each user on the network. The measuredquantum bit error rate and sifted key rate values are in good agreementwith theory.657327, Session 6A simple secure quantum authorization schemeX. Zhang, X. Xu, K. Tang, A. C.

The description of the scheme is given in details. Theauthorization is accomplished through a quantum channel by one waycommunication. We show that eavesdropper gets no information aboutkey no matter how many times she is listening on the channel. Thescheme is robust against both the passive and active attacks. Byinduction we prove that the scheme is information theoretically secure.657328, Session 6Quantum entanglement assisted key distributionK. Tang, The Graduate Ctr.CUNY P. Ji, John Jay College X. Zhang,The Graduate Ctr.CUNYQuantum correlations or entanglement is a basic ingredient for manyapplications of quantum information theory. One important applicationthat exploits the correlation nature of entangled photon states isquantum key distribution, which is proven unbreakable in principle andprovides the highest possible security that is impossible in classicalinformation theory. However, generating entangled photon pairs is not aConf. 6573 Quantum Information and Computation V spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 323simple task  only approximately one out of a million pump photonsdecay into a signal and idler photon pair. This low rate of entangledphoton pairs is further reduced by the overhead required in order for therectification of the inevitable errors due to channel imperfections orcaused by potential eavesdroppers.  As a consequence, quantum keydistribution suffers from a low bit rate, which is in the order of hundredsto thousands bits per second or below. On the other hand, the classicalpublic key distribution does not impose a tight limit on the transmissionrate. However, it is subject to the risks of eavesdroppers sitting in themiddle of the insecure channel. In this paper, we propose a hybrid keydistribution method which uses public key distribution method togenerate a raw key, and then uses entanglement assistedcommunication to modify the raw key by inserting a number of quantumbits in the raw key. Building upon the foundation of the unconditionalsecurity of quantum key distribution, we use the privacy amplification tomake the affection of inserted bits expand to a whole key. Our quantumentanglement assisted key distribution scheme greatly improves theefficiency of key distribution while without compromising the level ofsecurity achievable by quantum cryptography.657329, Session 7Quantum algorithms for topological quantum computingS.

Frey, Bucknell Univ.A quantity with the properties of a martingale is identified for conclusiveBayesian discrimination of two quantum states subjected to a sequenceof optimal weak measurements. This martingale is solely a function ofthe two system states and their respective probabilities at the time ofeach measurement, and it directly determines the evolving probability ofdiscrimination error. Also, it is constant if and only if the states are pure.For strictly mixed states the martingle is invariant only in an averagesense, with the consequence that, with some probability, the realizeddiscrimination error probability conditioned on prior measurements maybe less than the optimal Helstrom error probability. So for mixed statesconditionally superoptimal discrimination is possible. This is illustratednumerically in an example.657334, Poster SessionQuantum repeaters fundamental and futureY. Li, Y. Liu, J.

Patnaik, D. P. Casasent, Carnegie Mellon Univ.In our previous SAR ATR work, we used a subset of the MSTAR Movingand Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition public database forthe benchmark threeclass problem and we addressed confuser andclutter rejection.  We demonstrated that the test results using ourminimum noise and correlation energy MINACE filterbased classifierwere better than all prior work.  In this paper, we address classificationand rejection tests on the more challenging MSTAR tenclass publicdatabase.  To handle the full 360 range of aspect view in MSTAR data,we use a set of Minace filters for each object each filter should recognizethe object and its variants in some angular range.  We use fewer DIFsper object than prior work did.  We use our autoMinace algorithm thatuses a training and a validation set to select the Minace filter parameter cwhich selects emphasis on recognition or discrimination and to selectthe training set images to be included in the filter, so that the filter canachieve both good recognition and good confuser and clutter rejectionperformance. No confuser, clutter, or test set data are present in thetraining or the validation set. In tests, we do not assume that the testinputs pose is known as most prior work does, since pose estimation ofSAR objects has a large margin of error we address tests with proper useof SAR pose estimates in MSTAR recognition.  We address the use ofmultilook SAR data to improve performance.

Broadly,integrated sensing and processing ISP considers algorithms that areintegrated with the collection of data.  We demonstrate an ISP systemwhich utilizes a near Infrared NIR Hadamard multiplexing imagingsensor.  This prototype sensor incorporates a digital mirror array DMAdevice in order to realize a Hadamard multiplexed imaging system.Specific Hadamard codes can be sent to the sensor to realize innerproducts of the underlying scene rather than the scene itself.

An optical correlator is being considered as anextremely useful and important resource available to military personneland operations in the areas of surveillance and targeting.Recently, we proposed a WaveMACH waveletmodified maximumaverage correlation height filter for inplane and outofplane rotationinvariance. Use of wavelet transform improves performance of theMACH filter by reducing the number of filters required for identifying arotated target and enhances the correlation peak intensity significantly.The output of a hybrid digitaloptical correlator contains twoautocorrelation peaks and a strong dc.

S. Alam, Univ. of South Alabama M. N. Islam, Univ. of WestFlorida A. Bal, Istanbul Univ. TurkeyPattern recognition in hyperspectral imagery often suffers from a numberof limitations, which includes computation complexity, false alarms andmissing targets. The major reason behind these problems is that thespectra obtained by hyperspectral sensors do not produce adeterministic signature, because the spectra observed from samples ofthe same material may vary due to variations in the material surface,atmospheric conditions and other related reasons. In addition, thepresence of noise in the input scene may complicate the situation further.Therefore, the main objective of pattern recognition in hyperspectralimagery is to maximize the probability of detection and at the same timeminimize the probability of generating false alarms. Though severaldetection algorithms have been proposed in the literature, but most ofthem are observed to be inefficient in meeting the objective requirementmentioned above. This paper presents a novel detection algorithm whichis fast and simple in architecture. The algorithm involves a Gaussian filterto process the target signature as well as the unknown signature from theinput scene. A postprocessing step is also included after performingcorrelation to detect the target pixels. Computer simulation results showthat the algorithm can successfully detect all the targets present in theinput scene without any significant false alarm.657407, Session 3A new SVM for distorted IR object tracking andrecognitionY. F. Wang, D. Casasent, Carnegie Mellon Univ.In this paper, we apply our new SVRDM support vector representationand discrimination machine classifier to address ATR tracking andrecognition problems. The SVRDM classifier has good generalization likethe standard SVM does, and it has the added property of a goodrejection ability. In other words, it not only gives very promisingrecognition results on the true target classes, it is also able to reject otherunseen nontarget input. In ATR recognition applications, we are dealingwith a multiclass classification problem, and the targets are present atthe same range and depression angle, but may be present in differentthermal states and aspect views. When the number of target classes islarge, the multiclass classification problem with thermal state and aspectview variations becomes challenging. We apply our hierarchical SVRDMclassifier to address this recognition problem.In ATR tracking, the object is not only present with thermal and aspectview angle variations, its size range also changes as the sensorapproaches the target, and depression angle variations can exist.Therefore, it is important and realistic to know how our SVRDM handlesthese variations. We varied the number of aspect view training images,and we trained our SVRDMs at different sets of ranges, depressionangles, etc. to evaluate the effects of them. Thus, our results are mostunique and worthwhile but are not easily compared to prior work.Recognition, rejection and tracking test results are presented on bothsimulated and real infrared IR data.657408, Session 3Building robust appearance models using online featureselectionR. B. Porter, R. C. Loveland, E. Rosten, Los Alamos National Lab.In many tracking applications, adapting the target appearance modelover time can improve performance. This approach has found widestapplication in high frame rate video applications where latent variables,related to the objects appearance e.g., orientation and pose, varyslowly from one frame to the next. In these cases the appearancemodel and the tracking system are tightly integrated, and latentvariables are often included as part of the tracking systems dynamicmodel. In this paper we describe our efforts to track cars in low framerate data 1 frame  second, acquired from a highly unstable airborneplatform. Due to the low frame rate, and poor image quality, theappearance of a particular vehicle varies greatly from one frame to thenext. This leads us to a different problem how can we build the bestappearance model from all instances of a vehicle we have seen so far.The best appearance model should maximize the future performance ofthe tracking system, and maximize the chances of reacquiring thevehicle once it leaves the field of view. We propose an online featureselection approach to this problem and investigate the performance andcomputational tradeoffs with a realworld dataset.657409, Session 3Fully invariant multiple object recognition and trackingusing MACH and Kalman filtersP. Bone, Univ. of Sussex at Brighton United KingdomA method of recognising and tracking multiple solid objects in videosequences despite any kind of perspective distortion is demonstrated.Moving objects are initially segmented from the scene using abackground subtraction method to minimize the search area of the filter.A variation on the Maximum Average Correlation Height MACH filter isused to create invariance to orientation while giving high tolerance tobackground clutter and noise.  A log r mapping is employed to giveinvariance to inplane rotation and scale by transforming rotation andscale variations of the target object into vertical and horizontal shifts.The MACH filter is trained on the log r map of the target for a range oforientations and applied sequentially over the regions of movement insuccessive video frames to test for target objects.  A Kalman filter isemployed to continuously track the target objects over successiveframes, which has enabled the system to track multiple targets despitetemporary occlusion or intersection.657411, Session 3Advanced correlation filter methods for SHARP ATRP.

Alam, Univ. of South AlabamaHyperspectral imagery are used for a wide variety of military andcommercial applications, including target detection, tacking, agriculturalmonitoring and natural resources exploration. The reason of importanceof hyperspectral images is the fact that the hyperspectral imageryreveals spectral information about the scene that are not obtainable bysingle band. Unfortunately, many factors such as sensor noise andatmospheric scattering degrade the spatial quality of these images.Recently, many algorithms are introduced in the literature to improve theConf. 6574 Optical Pattern Recognition XVIII326 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssresolution compared to Prices algorithm results. In this paper, Pricesalgorithm is revisited to improve the results compared with thetraditional algorithm. The proposed method is dedicated to producehigh resolution bands from low resolution bands that are stronglycorrelated to the corresponding high resolution panchromatic image.The proposed method is based on using the local correlation instead ofusing the global correlation to improve the estimated interpolation in theconstructed high resolution. Using the local correlation significantlyimproved the results compare to the results of the traditional algorithm.The local correlation is achieved in small windows with predefined sizeacross the low resolution image. In addition, in this paper numerousstudies are conducted to compare the effect of the chosen window sizein the image quality. Many experiments are conducted using real lifehyperspectral imagery to evaluate the proposed algorithm and todemonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm.657413, Session 4Dynamic range compression deconvolution using Alawand law algorithmsB. Hajisaeed, S. K. Sengupta, W. D. Goodhue, Univ. ofMassachusettsLowell J. Khoury, C. L. Woods, Air Force ResearchLab. J. Kierstead, Solid State Scientific Corp.In this paper the Alawlaw Dynamic Range Compression algorithmused in telecommunication systems is proposed for the first time fornonlinear Dynamic Range Compression image deconvolution. In theproposed setup, a joint image of the blurred input information and theblur impulse response are jointly Fourier transformed via a lens to aCCD camera which acts as a squarelaw receiver. The output from theCCD camera is sent to the Alawlaw digital or analog receiver. Afternonlinear Alawlaw Dynamic Range compression deconvolution theoutput is sent to an SLM and then the output from the SLM is Fouriertransformed via a lens to produce an edgeenhanced version of thecorrected image and its conjugate.  The output then can be lowpassfiltered to recover the gray level image. The CCD camera is responsiblefor mixing the Fourier transforms of the impulse response and thedistorted image to compensate for the phase distortion and then the Alawlaw nonlinear transformation is responsible for enhancing boththe high frequencies and the signal to noise ratio. The proposedtechnique is supported by computer simulation.657414, Session 4A neural network identification system for spaceborneGCMS pattern recognitionT. T. Lu, T. . Chao, J. Macaskill, M.

The Comanchedatabase contains real IR data of eight targets with aspect view andthermal state variations.  We consider recognition of six of these targetsand we consider rejecting two targets confusers and clutter.  To handlethe full 360 range of aspect view in Comanche data, we use a set ofMinace filters for each object each filter should recognize the object insome angular range.  We use our autoMinace algorithm that uses atraining and a validation set to select the Minace filter parameter cwhich selects emphasis on recognition or discrimination and to selectthe training set images to be included in the filter, so that the filter canachieve both good recognition and good confuser and clutter rejectionperformance. No confuser, clutter, or test set data are present in thetraining or the validation set.  Use of the peaktocorrelation energyPCE ratio is found to perform better than the correlation peak heightmetric.  The use of circular versus linear correlations is addressedcircular correlations require less storage and fewer online computationsand are thus preferable.

The correlator was proposed forrecognition of external scenes illuminated by quasimonochromaticspatially incoherent light. The correlator hardware consists of digitalcamera with plugged in optical correlation filter unit and controlcomputer. The kinoform used as correlation filter is placed in a freespace of the SLR camera body between the interchangeable cameralens and the swing mirror. On the other hand, this correlator can beconsidered as a hybrid opticaldigital imaging system with wavefrontcoding. It allows not only to recognize objects in input scene but torestore, if needed, the whole image of input scene from correlationsignals distribution registered by SLR camera sensor. Linear methodsfor image reconstruction in the correlator are discussed.

C. Hanan, P. Kayathi, Oklahoma State Univ. C. L. Hughlett, ZionLabs. Inc.Recognition error is often situation dependent.  Variables including thesampling rate, object complexity, energy content, clutter, and noise, allplay a role in limiting the precision of recognition.  For a stationarycamera, discrete subjects are typically tracked in motion while thebackground remains constant.  For the rover situation, the backgroundis in motion and may be characterized to provide visual cues on rovertravel such as rate, pitch, roll, and distance to objects of interest orhazards.  Objects in the scene may be used as landmarks, orwaypoints, for such estimations.  As the objects are approached, theirscale increases and their orientation may change.  In addition,particularly on rough terrain, these orientation and scale changes maybe unpredictable.  Thus, without predicting the motion of landmarks, ageneral estimation of confidence in the position of the waypoints andtherefore the position of the rover may be calculated based on thetracking algorithm.  Here, automatic adaptive tracking in realtime fortarget recognition provided autonomous control of a moving platform.The motion platform consists of an autonomous rover testbed forvision based guidance and navigation.  Methods were implemented tomonitor tracking error and ensure a safe, accurate arrival at theintended science target.  Many methods are situation independentrelying only on the confidence error response of the target recognitionalgorithm.  Other methods take advantage of the scenario of combinedmotion and tracking.  In either case, only a single calibrated camerawas needed for position estimation.

S. Aslan, M. S. Alam, M. I. Elbakary, Univ. of South AlabamaKmeans clustering method has been employed in different applicationsof data analysis. This paper develops a target detection system usingthe kmeans algorithm including a preprocessing step based on theEuclidean distance. The preprocessing step reduces the computationalcomplexity of the kmeans algorithm in case of hyperspectral imagery.After reducing the set of pixels in the background from the data byusing the preprocessing step, kmeans algorithm is employed todetermine the clusters in rest of the image data cube. Having obtainedthe clustered data, the objects of interest can easily be detected usingthe known target signature. The proposed clustering algorithm issuccessfully applied to the real life hyperspectral data sets where theobjects of interest can efficiently be detected. The proposed schemeeffectively reduces the convergence time of the kmean algorithmcompared to that required by the traditional kmeans algorithm.657423, Poster SessionExperimental estimation of the recognition reliability inthe optical pattern recognition systemsV.

Lalonde, S. Foucher, L. Gagnon, CRIM Canada A. Janelle,VideoStream Technologies Inc. CanadaThe aim of this work was to develop a software module as an addon toa commercial pantiltzoom surveillance camera that allowsautonomous object detection, recognition and tracking in outdoor urbanenvironment. The module can discriminate between various movingobjects and identify the presence of pedestrians or vehicles, track them,and optionally zoom on them, all in near realtime.The module is composed of three main components 1 backgroundmodeling 2 blob management and 3 tracking. The first componentmaintains a background model that allows it to produce a probabilitymap that gives the probability for a pixel to be part of the background.Group of connected pixels that have a low probability forms a blob ofpotential interest that is further analyzed. The blob managementcomponent involves many operations. Blobs are first segmented basedon the probability map and further tracked on several frames. Each oftheses blobs initiates a candidate trajectory. Blobs are characterized bytheir shape, color and motion and are labeled as pedestrian, vehicle orother. Blobs in successive frame are fused together if there are similar inshape and color. If no matching blob is found, a bootstrap filter isapplied locally in order to find the foreground region the most coherentwith the blob motion and color. Finally, if the bootstrap failed the blob isrejected. Blob position and label are smoothed over time to increaseidentification robustness. Blobs with incoherent motion are rejected asthey most probably refer to noise or stationary objects e.g. tree leavesmoving in the wind. The output is a list of regions of interest containinginformation about the candidate objects label, position, speed,confidence level on the detection, etc.. Finally, the third modulecomponent allows tracking specific object despites changes in camerapoint of view. Tracking uses a particle filtering approach based on colorhistogram information, with the reference signature provided by theblob management component.The module was developed for and integrated into VideoStreamTechnologies VST OneTrack system, an intelligent tracking productusing PTZ cameras. The system includes an API that enablesmodifications to detection and tracking characteristics online duringthe operational mode.657502, Session 1Visual signal processing using flyeyebased algorithm todetect the road edgeN.

A recent report identified that the one cause ofrollovers is the drivers inability to assess rollover threats, such as cliff,soft ground, water, or culvert on the passenger side of the vehicle dueto the vehicles width. To reduce the number of rollover accidents, aroad edge detection and driver warning system is being developed todetect the rollover threats on the passenger side of the vehicle andwarns the driver. This system utilizes a unique, ultrafast imageprocessing algorithm based on neurobiology of insect vision and thestudy of fly vision.  The system consists of a camera system, a longrange, planar laser scanner, a processing module in which a biomimeticimage processor detects edges present in the images in realtime, anda Graphical User Interface GUI which displays the current road image,detected boundaries, and road side terrain steepness.657503, Session 1A progressive deskewing technique for document imageanalysisD. Charalampidis, Univ. of New Orleans J. Haralambides, BarryUniv.Skew detection is an important preprocessing step for severaldocument analysis algorithms, including those in the context of lawenforcement and intelligence scenarios. In this work, we propose a fastmethod that estimates skew angles based on a localtoglobalapproach. Most existing techniques, based on connected componentanalysis, group together pixels in order to form small document objects.Then, a Hough based technique is used to estimate the skew angle.The connected components detection process introduces an undesiredoverhead. Nearest neighbor based techniques examine only local pixelgroups, thus failing to achieve great skew accuracy. Projection basedtechniques create 1D profiles by successively rotating the documentwithin a range of angles. Detection can be accelerated consideringcoarse to fine rotations. However, rotation and projection may exhibitsignificant overheads. The proposed technique is characterized by bothhigh processing speed and high skew estimation accuracy. First, localareas are analyzed for an initial skew estimation by building anglehistograms between pairs of random points or blocks. Following a localregion selection process, a single histogram is obtained. Initiallyestimated angles are progressively refined by examining image objectsat increasingly larger distances. Special attention is given to multiplecolumn documents to eliminate deskew inaccuracies due to text linemisalignments across columns. Experimental results have shown thatthe proposed technique yields superior results in terms of estimationaccuracy and speed compared to recently published techniques.657504, Session 1Applications of adaptive featurespecific imagingJ. Ke, P. K. Baheti, M. A. Neifeld, The Univ. of ArizonaFeaturespecific imaging FSI refers to any imaging system that directlymeasures linear projections of an object irradiance distribution.Numerous reports of FSI also called compressive imaging using staticprojections can be found in the literature. In this paper we will presentadaptive methods of FSI suitable for the applications of a imagereconstruction and b target detection. Adaptive FSI for imagereconstruction is based on principal component features. The adaptivealgorithm employs an updated training set in order to determine theoptimal projection vector after each measurement. Adaptive FSI fordetection is based on a sequential hypothesis testing framework. Theprobability of each hypothesis is updated after each measurement andin turn defines a new optimal projection vector. Both of these newadaptive methods will be compared with static FSI as well asconventional imaging.657507, Session 2Power spectrum weighted edge analysis for targetdetection in imagesH. V. Karvir, J. A. Skipper, Wright State Univ.Edge extraction is a commonly used target detection tool. However,noisy images often yield broken edge lines that lead to misseddetections, and extraneous lines that may contribute to false targetdetections. We present a slidingblock approach for target detectionusing power spectrum analysis. In general, a line in an edge image thatcorresponds to a given frequency band will be represented as a peak inthe Fourier domain at a radius corresponding to that frequency, anddirection corresponding to the orientation of the structure in the spatialdomain. Knowing the line width and spacing, a bandpass filter isdesigned to extract the Fourier peaks corresponding to the target edgelines and suppress noise in the image. These peaks are then detected spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 329by amplitude thresholding. The frequency band width and thesubsequent spatial filter mask size are variable parameters for detectionof target objects of different sizes under known imaging geometries.Many military objects, such as trucks, tanks and missile launchers,produce definite signatures with parallel lines, and the algorithm provesto be ideal for detecting such objects. Moreover, shadowcastingobjects generally provide sharp edges and are readily detected. Theblock operation procedure offers the advantages of significant reductionof noise influence, improved edge detection, faster processing speedand versatility to detect diverse objects of different sizes in the image.With Scud missile launcher replicas as target objects, the method hasbeen successfully tested on terrain board test images under differentbackgrounds, illumination and imaging geometries with cameras ofdifferent spatial resolution and bitdepth.657508, Session 2A local variancebased filtering method for enhancementin superresolution image reconstructionN. Unaldi, V. K. Asari, Old Dominion Univ.A frequency domain approach for registration and bicubic interpolationcombined with a local variance based edge boosting technique for thereconstruction of an enhanced high resolution image from a set of lowresolution images is proposed in this paper. Planar shifts and rotationsin the low resolution images are determined by a phase correlationapproach performed on the polar coordinate representations of theirFourier transforms. Appropriate low pass filtering is performed on theimage set to eliminate aliasing effects. The pixels of the low resolutionimages are expressed in the coordinate frame of the reference imageand the image values are interpolated on a regular highresolution grid.The nonuniform interpolation technique which allows for thereconstruction of functions from samples taken at nonuniformlydistributed locations has relatively low computational complexity. Sincebicubic interpolation produces blurred edges due to its averaging effect,the edges of the reconstructed image are enhanced using a localvariance based approach. The normalized variance image obtainedusing an optimized mask size is scaled and added to the reconstructedimage. Performance of the proposed superresolution algorithm isevaluated by conducting experiments on both synthetic and real imagesets and the preliminary results are encouraging in terms of fidelity,smoothness and computation time.657510, Session 2Local adaptive contrast enhancement for color imagesJ. Dijk, J. G. M. Schavemaker, K. Schutte, TNOFEL NetherlandsA camera or display usually has a smaller dynamic range than thehuman eye. For this reason, objects that can be detected by the nakedeye may not be visible in recorded images. Lighting is an importantfactor improper lighting impairs visibility of details or even entireobjects. When a human is observing a scene with different kinds oflighting, such as shadows, he will need to see details in both the darkand light parts of the scene.For grey value images such as IR imagery, algorithms have beendeveloped in which the local contrast of the image is enhanced byusing local adaptive techniques. In this paper we present how suchalgorithms can be adapted so that the details in color images areenhanced while retaining the color information. We propose to apply thecontrast enhancement to the luminance channel of the color signal. Thecolor coordinates of the signal remain the same.This technique can for instance be used by humans monitoringmovements of people on a display in order to signal suspiciousbehavior. To do this effectively, specific individuals should be as easy torecognize and track as possible. This requires optimal local contrast,and is sometimes much helped by color  for instance, when tracking aperson who is wearing colored clothes. In such applications, enhancedlocal contrast in color images leads to more effective monitoring.657529, Session 2All source adaptive fusion for aided navigation in nonGPS environmentO. Aboutalib, B.

The focus of EM algorithm is that givenunknown data values the distribution from samples can be used todetermine an estimate for the posterior probability of belonging to agiven cluster. This method can be considered as two maximumlikelihood approaches used for mixture analysis. With the variousorientations, shapes and sizes that data clusters represent in featurespace the distribution is improved with the use of mixed models whichrepresent the distribution. The first is the mixture approach whichmaximizes the likelihood over the mixture parameters. The second is byclassification based on maximizing the likelihood over the mixtureparameters and identifying the class of the mixture component originfor each exemplar. The classification is improved with the use of aBayes classification technique which uses the posterior probability,covariance matrix and the mean of the distribution representing thecluster.657511, Session 3Image data representation for efficient optimization ofobjective criterionR. Sundaram, Gannon Univ.Computing architectures to process image data and optimize anobjective criterion are identified. One such objective criterion is theenergy in the error function. The data is partitioned and the errorfunction is optimized in stages. Each stage consists of identifying anactive partition and performing the optimization with the data in thispartition. The other partitions of the data are inactive i.e. maintain theircurrent values. The optimization progresses by switching between thecurrently active partition and the remaining inactive partitions. In thispaper, sequential and parallel update procedures within the activepartition are presented. These procedures are applied to retrieve imagedata from linearly degraded samples. In addition, the local gradient ofthe error functional is estimated from the observed image data usingsimple linear convolution operations. This optimization process iseffective when the dimensions of the data and the number of partitionsincrease. The purpose of developing such data processing strategies isto emphasize the conservation of resources such as availablebandwidth, computations, and storage in present day Webbasedtechnologies and multimedia information transfer.657513, Session 3Fast orthogonal heap transforms theory and applicationin cryptographyA. M. Grigoryan, R. N. Raghunath, The Univ. of Texas at San AntonioIn general, the existent linear unitary transforms, such as the Fourier,Hadamard, and cosine transforms, are defined by matrices withconstant coefficients. The complete systems of basis functions forthese transforms do not use many properties of signals and theirpeculiarities. Many signals are composed by sinusoidal waves, and theFourier transform can thus be applied for signal representation in thefrequency domain. However, it is difficult to imagine that simplerectangular waves or their linear combinations are represented bysinusoidal waves in reality. In the discrete time case, it is also difficult toassume that any Npoint signal has been created by sinusoidal wavesof N different frequencies. This paper presents a novel approach tocompose discrete orthogonal and unitary transforms that are inducedby specified signals, which are considered to be generators of thetransforms. Properties and examples of such transforms, which we calldiscrete heap transforms are given. The transforms are fast, because ofa simple form of decomposition of their matrices, and they can beapplied for signals of any length. Fast algorithms of calculation of thedirect and inverse heap transforms do not depend on the length of theprocessed signals. In this paper, we demonstrate the applications of theheap transforms for transformation, processing, and reconstruction of1D signals and 2D images, as well as in the cryptography, whentransforming the plaintext by very short keys. Different examples ofgenerating transformation and designing their keys are considered.657514, Session 3Wavelet priors for multiframe image restorationP. M. Shankar, M. A.

We exploit this prior knowledge within a novelstatistical framework for multiframe image restoration based on themaximum aposteriori MAP algorithm. We describe an iterativealgorithm for obtaining a highfidelity object estimate from multiplewarped, blurred, and noisy lowresolution images. We compare our newmethod with several other techniques including linear restoration, L1minimization, and minimum total variation. Both performance andcomputational issues will be discussed.657515, Session 3Elastic image registration using subspace constraintsA. S. Elsafi, R. Zewail, N. Durdle, Univ. of Alberta CanadaImage registration is the process of aligning two images or more fromdifferent viewpoints, at different instances, or at different modalities. Inparticular, the main goal of image registration is to determine thedeformation, i.e. the geometric transformation relating images to bealigned. Some of the recent approaches in image alignment employlocal deformation models followed by global regularization proceduresto reject improper translations. In this article, we propose a newframework that incorporates prior deformation knowledge in order toobtain smooth transformation maps. During the training phase, anelastic image registration procedure is used to obtain the deformationfields by modeling the nonrigid deformations as locally affine andglobally smooth flow fields. Next, the estimated geometrictransformation maps are used to obtain a prior deformation model usingtwo subspace projection techniques. The first method is principlecomponent analysis PCA which uses only second order statistics. Thesecond method is independent component analysis which uses higherorder statistics in order to generate the deformation basis. A smoothdeformation is now guaranteed by projecting the locally affinetransformation onto a subspace of allowed deformations. Oneadvantage of our approach is in its ability to guarantee smoothnesswithout the need for iterative regularization. The new algorithm wasvalidated using two databases, the Amsterdam library of images ALOI.Our experiments demonstrate promising results in terms of meansquare error and with significant reduction in computational time.657527, Session 3Data mining within digital imagesT. P. Donovan, Midwestern State Univ.Previous papers have studied the relationship between a bit map digitalimage and a given object, called the search object. In particular, tosignal that it is likely, or not likely, that the search object appears, atleast partially, in the image. Edges in the search object and in the digitalimage are then represented as objects, in the object orientedprogramming sense. Each edge or segment of an edge is representedas a normalized Bezier cubic parameterized curve. The normalizationprocess is intended to remove the effect of size in the edge or edgesegment.  If the edges match and their orientation is the same, then thesystem signals that the object is likely to appear in the image and thecoordinates in the image of the object are returned. The functioning ofthe algorithm is not dependent on scaling, rotation, translation, orshading of the image. This paper attempts to use data miningtechniques together with these representations of edges in a collectionof images to try to establish time and space relationships betweenoccurrences in the various images. These relationships could then beused to advantage in supplying information for defense, corporate, orlaw enforcement intelligence.Conf. 6575 Visual Information Processing XVI spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 331657516, Session 4Taskspecific information an imaging system analysistoolA. Ashok, P. K. Baheti, M. A. Neifeld, The Univ. of ArizonaWe present a novel method for computing the information content of animage. We introduce the notion of taskspecific information TSI inorder to quantify imaging system performance for a given task. Thisnew approach employs a recentlydiscovered relationship between theShannon mutualinformation and minimum estimation error. Wedemonstrate the utility of the TSI formulation by applying it to severalfamiliar imaging systems including a geometric imagers, b diffractionlimited imagers, and c projectivecompressive imagers.

S. DaPonte, T. J. Sadowski, C. Broadbridge, A. Lehman, D.Krishna, L. Marinella, P. Munhutu, M. Sawicki, Southern ConnecticutState Univ.Nanoparticles, particles with a diameter of 1100 nanometers nm, areof interest in many applications including device fabrication, quantumcomputing, and sensing because their size may give them propertiesthat are very different from bulk materials. Further advancement ofnanotechnology cannot be obtained without an increasedunderstanding of nanoparticle properties such as size diameter andsize distribution frequently evaluated using transmission electronmicroscopy TEM. In the past, these parameters have been obtainedfrom digitized TEM images by manually measuring and counting manyof these nanoparticles, a task that is highly subjective and laborintensive.More recently, computer imaging particle analysis has emerged as anobjective alternative by counting and measuring objects in a binaryimage. This paper will describe the procedures used to preprocess aset of gray scale TEM images so that they could be correctlythresholded into binary images. This allows for a more accurateassessment of the size and frequency size distribution ofnanoparticles. Several preprocessing methods including pseudo flatfield correction, FFT band pass filtering and rolling ball backgroundcorrection were investigated with the rolling ball algorithm yielding thebest results. Examples of particle analysis will be presented for differenttypes of materials and different magnifications. In addition, a methodbased on the results of particle analysis for identifying and removingsmall noise particles will be discussed. This filtering technique is basedon identifying the location of small particles in the binary image andremoving them without affecting the size of other larger particles.657518, Session 4An architecture for the efficient implementation ofcompressive sampling reconstruction algorithms inreconfigurable hardwareF. E. Ortiz, E. J. Kelmelis, EM Photonics, Inc.According to the ShannonNyquist theory, the number of samplesrequired to reconstruct a signal is proportional to its bandwidth.Recently, it has been shown that acceptable reconstructions arepossible from a reduced number of random samples, a process knownas compressive sampling.  Taking advantage of this realization hasradical impact on power consumption and communication bandwidth,crucial in applications based on smallmobileunattended platformssuch as UAVs and distributed sensor networks.  Although the benefitsof these compression techniques are selfevident, they require thesolution of nonlinear signal processing algorithms, which limitapplicability in portable and realtime systems.  In particular, 1 thepower consumption associated with the difficult computations offsetsthe power savings afforded by compressive sampling, and 2 limitedcomputational power prevents these algorithms to maintain pace withthe datacapturing sensors, resulting in undesirable data loss.  FPGAbased computers offer low power consumption and high computationalcapacity, providing a solution to both problems simultaneously.  In thispaper, we present an architecture that implements the algorithmscentral to compressive sampling in an FPGA environment.  We start bystudying the computational profile of the convex optimizationalgorithms used in compressive sampling.  Then we present the designof a pixel pipeline suitable for FPGA implementation, able to computethese algorithms.  Performance estimates will be given for thiscomputational kernel, and, finally, realtime video compression will beused as a case study, in order to evaluate the benefits andshortcomings of an FPGAbased computer for the processingassociated with compressive sampling.657519, Session 4Median predictorbased lossless video compressionalgorithm for IR image sequencesR. Saran, H. B. Srivastava, A.

In this paper, wepropose a simple, fast and easy to realizableonhardware losslessvideo compression algorithm that is well suited for IR imageries.Context based median predictor is used for prediction of referencepixels. Three neighboring pixels are used as context for prediction.Interframe coding is performed by encoding the redundant pixels in anefficient way, using one bit code. Finally the arithmetic coder is used asentropy coding. The proposed algorithm is able to operate in imagecompression mode as well as video compression mode. The proposedMPLVC Median Predictor based Lossless Video Compressionalgorithm is compared with JPEGLS Joint Pictures Experts GroupLossless and FELICS Fast and Efficient Lossless Image CompressionSystem for compression performance. The results demonstrate thatproposed algorithm is superior in encoding rate with added advantagein simplicity and ease in realization on hardware.657520, Session 4BTCbased object trackingV. K.

Block Truncation coding BTC is appliedon selected object of image frame and Ntuple pattern is formed.Minimum hamming distance in twodimensional plane is computedwhich is used to evaluate the amount of correlation among the selectedobjects in successive frames. Peak correlation provides the object shift,which is used for object tracking. The method is compared with existingmean based correlation, and transform based correlation techniques. Inaddition, the algorithm can be implemented in real time.657506, Poster SessionObjectively assessing underwater image quality for thepurpose of automated restorationW. Hou, A. D. Weidemann, Naval Research Lab.In order to automatically enhance and restore images, especially thosetaken from underwater environments where scattering and absorptionby the medium strongly influence the imaging results even within shortdistances, it is critical to have access to an objective measure of thequality of images obtained. This contribution presents an approach tomeasure the sharpness of an image based on the weighted grayscaleangle GSA of detected edges. Images are first decomposed bywavelet transform to remove random and part medium noises, toaugment chances of true edge detection. Sharpness of each edge isthen determined by means of regression to determine the slopebetween grayscale values of edge pixels versus locations, which is theConf. 6575 Visual Information Processing XVI332 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsstangent of an angle based on grayscale. The overall sharpness of theimage is the average of each measured GSAs, weighted by the ratio ofthe power of high frequency components of the image from the first leveldecomposition details, to the total power of the image. Adaptivedetermination of edge widths is facilitated by values associated withimage noise variances. To further remove noise contamination, edgewidths less than corresponding noise variances or regression requirementare discarded. Without losing generality while easily expandable, onlyhorizontal edge widths are used in this study. Standard test images aswell as those taken from field are used to be compared subjectively. Initialrestoration results from field measured underwater images based on thisapproach and weakness of the metric are also presented and discussed.657512, Poster SessionImage quality measure using a quadtree homogeneityanalysisE. P. Lam, ThalesRaytheonSystemsImage quality is needed to compare processed images with knownreference images when there is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of animage processing application.  Examples that require image quality arecomparison of compresseduncompressed image with known referenceimage, comparison of reconstructed image with reference image, andcomparison of two images in time.  Objective image quality is a difficultresearch area because there is no widely accepted measure.Historically, image quality is quantified as the mean squared error MSEor peak signal to noise ratio PSNR.  MSE and PSNR are used becausethey are simple to calculate and there is no measure that is widelyaccepted in the image processing community.  MSE and PSNR fail totake into account the human visual system, because they examine onlypixel values.  One needs to look at the big picture of determining what aclose an image is when compared to a reference image.  Structure of theimage is important because this provides global information about imagequality.Quadtree is performed recursively until all regions are homogeneous oruntil number of maximum decomposition is reached.  The homogeneousregions also contain information of the global structure of the image.Edge extraction fails to detect noise.  Quadtree performs more recursivedecomposition because the regions are not as homogeneous with noise.Using edge extraction and quadtree gives a more robust image qualitymetric.An image quality score is derived from edge extraction and quadtreeanalysis.  The edge extraction examine if an image is blurred.  If an imageis blurred, the edges are smeared.  This causes the number of edge pixelsto increase.Quadtree analysis uses the quadtree boundaries.  Quadtree analysisdivides an image into four equalsized quadrants.  If a quadrant isheterogeneous, it is divided into to four equalsized quadrants.  Thedivision of quadrants is terminated when the set number of levels isreached or if a quadrant is homogeneous in pixel values.  This requires aquadrant metric.  Some examples of a quadrant metrics are variance andentropy measures.This presentation demonstrates an image quality metric that examines theimage structure rather than using pixels intensity values.  We examine theoverall structure of the reference image and the analysis image.  This isdone with edge extraction and quadtree decomposition.  Edge extractiongives us the global structure information.  It is these edges that composeobjects in the image.657521, Poster SessionComparison of thresholding techniques on nanoparticleimagesJ. S. DaPonte, T. J. Sadowski, C. Broadbridge, D. Day, A. Lehman, D.Krishna, L. Marinella, P. Munhutu, M. Sawicki, Southern ConnecticutState Univ.Thresholding is an image processing procedure used to convert an imageconsisting of gray level pixels into a black and white binary image. Oneapplication of thresholding is particle analysis. Once foreground objectsare separated from the background, a quantitative analysis thatcharacterizes the number, size and shape of particles is obtained whichcan be of assistance when evaluating a series of nanoparticle samples.Numerous thresholding techniques exist differing primarily in how theydeal with variations in noise, illumination and contrast. In this paper,several popular thresholding algorithms are qualitatively andquantitatively evaluated on transmission electron microscopy TEM andatomic force microscopy AFM images. Initially, six thresholdingalgorithms were investigated Otsu, RiddlerCalvard, Kittler, Entropy,Tsai and Maximum Likelihood. The RiddlerCalvard algorithm was notincluded in the quantitative analysis because it did not produceacceptable qualitative results for several of the images in the series.Two quantitative measures were used to evaluate these algorithms. Oneis based on comparing object area and the other is based on diameterbefore and after thresholding. For AFM images the Kittler algorithmyielded the best results followed by the Entropy and MaximumLikelihood techniques. The Tsai algorithm yielded the top results forTEM images followed by the Entropy and Kittler methods.657523, Poster SessionVisualized measurement instrument based on electricalcapacitance tomography techniqueD. Chen, Harbin Univ. of Science and Technology ChinaThe subject investigated in this paper is oilwater twophase flow.

An ECTmeasurement system of 8electrode oilwater twophase flow is set upthat is comprised of a measurement circuit with straycapacitanceresistance and a 80C32 SCM, both of which control the measurementamong the pole plates and the capture system. The imagereconstruction for oilwater twophase crosssectional image and thecalculating of oilwater twophase water content can be accomplishedby an adaptive threshold image reconstruction algorithm, and theprecision of reconstruction is about 1, which can meet the need ofidentification of flow regime for oilwater twophase flow. Therefore, itoffers a new method for the visualized measurement of oilwater twophase flow parameters.657525, Poster SessionAn approach of key frame extraction based on rough setT. Wang, W. Yu, L.

Rabbani, M. Vafadust, Amirkabir Univ. of Technology IranThe performance of estimators, such as maximum a posteriori MAP, isstrongly dependent on the accuracy of the employed distribution for thenoisefree data and the accuracy of the involving parameters. In thispaper, we select a proper model for the distribution of waveletcoefficients and present a new image denoising algorithm. We modelthe wavelet coefficients in each subband with a mixture of bivariateLaplacian probability density functions pdfs using local parameters forthe mixture model. This model allows capturing the heavytailed natureof the coefficients and to exploit the interscale dependencies of thewavelet coefficients. The empirically observed correlation between thecoefficient amplitudes are locally calculated and used in order tocharacterize the model.

Gimeno Sarciada, H. Lamela, M. Gonzlez, M. Jimnez, M. RuizLlata, Univ. Carlos III de Madrid Spain3D image processing detection and identification of special features inreal time video images is considered to be a very difficult problem tosolve, this is mainly due to the following reasons the large amount ofinformation to be processed in a very short time and the differences inthe shapes and lighting for the different objects to be processed. In orderto process effectively a high amount of generalization is required for theprocessor to recognize the same object under different circumstances.SVM 1 is a possible solution to these problems.Support Vector Machines, SVM are a new promising model for neuralnetworks. They have remarkable properties of generalization and speed.Their performance is higher compared to other more conventional neuralnetworks. One of their advantages is that they seek to lower structuralerror instead of training error putting an upper limit on their generalizationcapabilities. SVM training is the equivalent to solving a quadraticprogramming problem with box inequality restrictions, where the numberof variables equals the number of support vectors.Anguita et all. 2 have shown how a recurrent network can be used tosolve a quadratic programming problem for SVM learning. They alsopresented a hardware scheme for an electronic development based on arecurrent analogue circuit. The scheme in 2 has been implemented in ananalogue circuit with 40 support vectors, showing that analoguequadratic programming has several problems, the main one being thatmost of the actual processing is done by digital machines forcing ananaloguedigital conversion before using the data. However their mainadvantage is their high speed, parallel processing and lower powerconsumption. R. Genov and G. Cawenberghs 3 have developed amixed architecture with analogue processing of a digital input and outputthis overcomes the disadvantages and uses the strengths of analogueprogramming.In this work we propose a new scheme using an optoelectronic matrixvector multiplier using an optical broadcast neural processor 4, 5 thisallows us to speed up the process on a mixed architecture that uses fastspeed neural processing 6.REFERENCES1 V.

Rajan, Defence Research and Development Canada Canada R.Doraiswami, Univ. of New Brunswick CanadaA novel methodology for segmentation of multicomponent signalsburied in additive white noise using singular value decomposition SVDin the joint timefrequency domain is proposed.  The segmentationproblem is formulated using the paradigm of binary statisticalhypothesis testing.  Using the Generalized Likelihood Ratio GLR, theoptimal test statistic is shown to be the sum of squares of the norm ofthe principal components of the signal in the joint timefrequencydomain.  The signaltonoise ratio SNR of the dominant signalfrequencies is assumed to be sufficiently high to determine thebandwidth of the signal components.  This methodology may beapplied in several areas of signal processing including wideband RFsignals, radar signals, audio and speech signals, and biological signals.The proposed segmentation methodology is evaluated on  speech andheart sound signals.To illustrate our approach, we use the Morlet wavelet transform toobtain a transformed signal that has better time and frequencylocalization and also attenuate noise components. The statisticaldecision theory is then applied to segment the components in the timefrequency domain.  The test statistics or the features for isolating thecomponents are the principal components of the wavelet transformedsignal.  This test statistics may be viewed as a mapping from the timedomain to the signal plus noise subspace in the timefrequency domain.The crucial problem of determining the parameters governing the teststatistic and the threshold is solved by using the principal componentanalysis of the signal.  As the requirements for time domain andfrequency domain segmentation are contradictory, a two stagesegmentation scheme time domain and frequency domain, notnecessarily in that order is then used to segment the signals.657622, Session 3Analysis of breast MRI data dased on topographicindependent and treedependent component analysisA.

In DCEMRIthe time related development of the signal intensity after theadministration of contrast agent can provide valuable information abouttissue characteristics at pixel level. The integration of this informationconstitutes an important step in the analysis of DCEMRI data.In this contribution we investigate the applicability of three differentapproaches from the field of independent component analysis ICA forfeature extraction and image fusion in the context of DCEMRI data.Next to FastICA, TreeDependent Component Analysis and TopographicICA are applied to twelve clinical cases from breast cancer researchwith a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis.

While unsupervisedclustering techniques often allow for the detection of interestingpatterns in the data, topographic mapping techniques such as the SelfOrganizing Map SOM or the Topographic Mapping for Proximity DataTMP provide additionally a structured overview of the data.In this contribution we investigate the applicability of two recentlyproposed variants of these algorithms which make use of conceptsfrom nonEuclidean geometry.

K. Chari, C. E. Halford, A. L. Robinson, E. L. Jacobs, Univ. ofMemphisThis paper presents the use of independent component spatiospectralfilters SSF for multispectral infrared image segmentation. The SSFs arethe reconstruction filters generated by applying independentcomponent analysis to multispectral infrared images. It is known thatthese filters of natural visible color images show some form of coloropponency similar to the neurons in the primate visual cortex. Thisstudy determines if any such spectral opponency exists in the SSFsderived from multispectral infrared images. SSFs of natural and manmade materials in the mid wave infrared region are compared andcontrasted. Two approaches are used to obtain feature vectors forimage segmentation. In the first technique separate spatial energyvectors for each band are generated. While in the second methodcombined spatiospectral energy vectors are generated using theopponency associated with the SSFs. When images are filtered withSSFs, the objects in the image tuned spectrally and spatially to thatparticular filter would respond with the highest energy output. Theseenergy vectors are further processed and fed to a clustering algorithmfor image segmentation. These SSFs learn their spectral opponency,spatial frequency and orientation characteristics from the data itself.The advantages of using such filters over gabor filters, discrete wavelettransforms and fractals for multispectral feature vector generation arestudied.657637, Poster SessionA taste of compressed sensingR.

Using this approachcould form the basis of an image fusion approach for a variety ofapplications.657615, Session 5Waveletbased texture image classification using vectorquantizationE. P. Lam, ThalesRaytheonSystemsClassification of image segments on textures can be helpful for targetrecognition.  Sometimes target cueing is performed before targetrecognition. Textures are sometimes used to cue an image processor ofa potential region of interest.  In certain imaging sensors, such as thoseused in synthetic aperture radar, textures may be abundant.  Thetextures may be caused by the object material or speckle noise.  Evenspeckle noise can create the illusion of texture, which must becompensated in image preprocessing.There are many approaches of texture classification.  Some use Fourierbased methods while the recent approaches use a multiple channelapproach.  It was shown in recent works that using waveletdecomposition can perform classification using a twochannel subbandcoder.  Instead of performing a dyadic wavelet decomposition in someimage compression methods, a wavelet packet decomposition can beperformed.  The dyadic wavelet tree does not perform well with textureclassification, because the decomposition approach emphasizes thelower spatial frequency components.  Textures often have mid and highspatial frequency components that make the wavelet packet ideal forthis.In this paper, we will discuss how to perform texture classification butconstrain the number of wavelet packet node decomposition.  Thisallows the decomposition to stop at a finite time.  If not constrained, thenew approach may run indefinitely.  The new approach performs a twochannel wavelet decomposition.  Comparing the strength of each newsubband with others at the same level of the wavelet packet determineswhen to stop further decomposition.  This type of decomposition isperformed recursively.  Once the decompositions stop, the structure ofthe packet is stored in a data structure.  Using the information from thedata structure, dominating channels are extracted.  These are definedas paths from the root of the packet to the leaf with the higheststrengths.  The list of dominating channels are used to train a learningvector quantization neural network.A quadtree based segmentation approach can be employed before useof texture classification.  The size of image chip extracted fromsegmentation can affect texture classification because image energy isaffected by chip size.  Therefore, it may not be possible to compare thefeature vector with the known feature space vectors of textures from thedatabase.  Because of the nature of the feature vector extraction, it ispossible for the feature vector of the unknown texture to be smaller insize, compared to the feature vector size of the database.   The purposeof quadtree segmentation is to achieve homogeneity.Using the wavelet decomposition approach, it is found that the allimages have one common dominant channel.  This dominant channelcorresponds to the low frequency spatial frequencies.  Because we arenot interested in using the energy of the channels, the dominantConf. 6576 Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, UnsupervisedNanoBiomimetic Sensors and Neural Networks V spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 337channel is discarded during the feature extraction.  The dominantchannel is used for further wavelet decomposition, if needed.  Since allimages have this common dominant channel, it does not help indistinguishing between texture classes.657644, Session 5Next gen wavelets downsampling preserving statisticsH. H.

Bhuiyan,The Univ. of AlabamaHuntsvilleCrack evaluation is essential for effective classification of pavementcracks. Digital images of pavement cracks have been analyzed usingtechniques such as fuzzy set theory and neural networks. Bidimensionalempirical mode decomposition BEMD, a new image analysis methodrecently developed, can potentially be used for pavement crackevaluation. BEMD is an extension of the empirical mode decompositionEMD, which can decompose nonlinear and nonstationary signals intobasis functions called intrinsic mode functions IMF. IMFs aremonocomponent functions that have well defined instantaneousfrequencies. EMD is a sifting process that is nonparametric and datadriven it does not depend on an a priori basis set. It is able to removenoise from signals without complicated convolution processes. BEMDdecomposes an image into intrinsic mode surfaces IMS, which are thetwodimensional analogs of IMFs. A synthetic image will be generatedand analyzed with BEMD, before and after the introduction of noise thatmay simulate the existence of a crack. Results of the analysis can helpin crack evaluation for pavement crack classification.657631, Session 9Passive unattended sensorsR. W. Van Dine, DKL International, Inc.DKL is developing sensors to enhance the survivability of ground assetsin an urban combat environment by providing unattended detection ofhuman electromagnetic fields. This will provide the warfighter with apotent tool for force protection and asymmetric warfarecountermeasures. The sensor detects changes in the charge pattern inthe detection area. Specifically, it detects the change in volts permeter in the ultralowfrequency ULF .2 to 10 Hz range.When a person walks into the detection area, the persons ULF electricfield changes the charge pattern on the materials in the detection area.The field of the person couples weakly to the materials in the detectionarea.  The persons movement changes that capacitive charge couplingand creates a charge redistribution on the materials in the detectionarea.  When the volts per meter pattern shift the circuit detects anddisplays the changing voltage pattern.  If the person stands still thecharges equalize and the voltage pattern stabilizes.  With each step orslight movement the person creates another charge redistribution orshift in the voltage pattern. During periods when the charges areequalized the person is not moving the circuit no longer can detect thepresence of that person. The system detects movement only in a totallypassive manner.657633, Session 9Noninvasive methodology for wellness baseline profilingD. W. Chung, Chung Yuan Christian Univ. Taiwan Y. S.

H. MeyerBse, R. Perry, A. MeyerBse, Florida State Univ. A.Vera, M. Pattichis, The Univ. of New MexicoFieldprogrammable gate arrays FPGAs are on the verge ofrevolutionizing digital signal processing. Many frontend digital signalprocessing DSP algorithms, such as FFTs, multichannel filterbanks, orwavelets, to name just a few, previously built with ASICs orprogrammable digital signal processors, are now most often replacedby FPGAs.Design of current DSP applications using stateofthe art multimilliongates devices requires a broad foundation of the engineering skillsranging from knowledge of hardwareefficient DSP algorithms to CADdesign tools. The requirement of short timetomarket, however,requires to replace the traditional HDL based designs by a MatLabSimulinkbased design flow. This not only allows the over 1 millionMatLab users to design FPGAs but also to bypass the hardwaredesign engineer and leads therefore to shorter development time.We have evaluated the AlteraSimulink tool flow used for a Universitydesign environment and present design experience of a semestercourse at FAMUFSU College of Engineering. We talk about requiredbackground knowledge, key target smart firmware for FPGAs andpossible advanced designs, e.g. FFT and multirate filter banks andwavelets designed by students with only basic logic experience.Acknowledgement The project was supported by a NSF CCLI awardNo. 0442600657611, Session 10FPGA wavelet processor design using language forinstructionset architectures LISAU. H. MeyerBse, Florida State Univ. M. Witte, RWTH AachenGermany S. Rao, K. Lenk, Florida State Univ. H. Meyr, RWTHAachen GermanyA fundamental change is taking place in the world of logic design. Anew generation of design tools is empowering software developers totake their algorithmic expressions straight into hardware without havingto learn traditional hardware design techniques. These tools andassociated design methodologies are classified collectively aselectronic system level ESL design, broadly referring to system designand verification methodologies that begin at a higher level ofabstraction than the current mainstream register transfer level RTL.A microprocessor, a much more efficient way of using silicon than adirect hardware implementation of an algorithm,  has become in recentyears one of the most important IP blocks for FPGA vendors. Altera forinstance reported that they sold 10,000 systems of the NIOSmicroprocessor development systems in the first 3 year alone. Xilinxreported a even larger number of Downloads of their MicroBlazemicroprocessors.The design of an microprocessor is a long, tedious, and errorpronetask consisting of typically three design phases architectureexploration, software design assembler, linker, loader, profiler,architecture implementation RTL generation for FPGA or ASIC andverification. The Language for instructionset architectures LISA allowsto model a microprocessor not only from instructionset but also fromarchitecture description including pipelining behavior that allows adesign and development tool consistency over all levels of the design.To explore the capability of LISA processor design platform LPDP wepresent in this paper three microprocessor design that implement a 88wavelet transform processor that is typically used in todays FBIfingerprint compression  database. We have designed a 3 pipelined 16bit RISC processor NanoBlaze, since Xilinx only offer 8 bitmicrocontroller PicoBlaze and 32bit RISC microprocessorMicroBlaze but typical DSP object are more efficient handled by 16 bitprocessor. Although RISC is usually considered a fast processor dueto design concept like constant instruction word size, deep pipelinesand many general purpose register, it turns out that for DSP operationconsume essential processing time in a RISC processor. In a secondstep we have used design principle from programmable digital signalprocessor PDSP to improve the throughput of the DWT processor. Amultiplyaccumulate operation along with indirect addressing operationwere the key to achieve higher throughput. A further improvement ispossible with todays FPGA technology. Todays FPGAs offer a largenumber of embedded array multipliers and it is now feasible to design atrue vector processor TVP. A multiplication of two vector can be donein just one clock cycle with our TVP, a complete scalar product in twoclock cycles. Code profiling and FPGA synthesis results are provided thatdemonstrate the essential improvement that a TVP has compared with atraditional RISC or PDSP design.657617, Session 10Neural dynamic optimization for unmanned aerial vehicletrajectory designP. Xu, A. Verma, Knowledge Based Systems, Inc.Online aerial vehicle trajectory design and reshaping is desired for a classof autonomous aerial vehicles in order to achieve real time decisionmaking and mission planning capability. An aerial vehicle can be modeledas a nonlinear multiinputmultioutput MIMO discrete system. The inputsinclude the control parameters and the current system states describingthe vehicle spatial coordinates and vehicle velocity for each degree offreedom. The outputs are the new system states. Given a task, the goal ofan ideal trajectory design system is to generate a series of controlparameter inputs that satisfy the objectives of the task under variousdisturbances and model uncertainties.Conventional approaches such as Dynamic Programming DP suffer fromthe nonlinearity of the MIMO system and the highdimensionality of thesystem state space. In this paper, we apply a Neural Dynamic OptimizationNDO based approach to overcome these difficulties. A NDO modelconsists of two modules. One module simulates the nonlinear MIMOsystem and the other module, a multilayer perceptron MLP neuralnetwork, generates the control parameters online. The inputs of the MLPare the timevariant states of the MIMO systems. The outputs of the MLP,the control parameters, will be used by the MIMO to generate new systemstates. By such a formulation, a NDO model can approximate the timevarying optimal feedback solution. In addition, the MLP can also receive anoptional reference inputs to force the control parameters to follow them toachieve some desired goal. Our preliminary result on a simplified UAVmodel is promising. We are conducting research on applying the methodon a real vehicle with more inputs.657630, Session 103D map generation for biomimetic applications using a network of multistatic radar sensorsS. L.

J. Dobeck, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr.An asymptotic theory is presented for the analysis of classifiers whosedesigns are based on optimizing a cost function that governs how wellthe classifier estimates class membership from a set of training featurevectors.  This theory gives a fundamental understanding of howdifferent cost functions favor certain subsets of the training data whenapproximating the position of decision boundaries in feature space.Thus one can quantify the limitations that the choice of a specific costfunction imposes on classifier design.  This work extends previous workthat relates classifier design to approximations of the Bayesian aposteriori probability of class membership e.g., Any Reasonable CostFunction Can be Used for A Posteriori Probability Approximation by M.Saerens, et al, IEEE Transactions on NN, September 2002.  The papershows how different cost functions, in concert with the underlying jointclass pdf, determine where class decision boundaries are positioned infeature space.  For example, our analysis shows that mutual informationcriterion positions decision boundaries between dominate class modesof the joint class pdf, while the mean squared error criteria positionsthese boundaries where the conditional class probabilities areapproximately equal.   Therefore, depending on the classificationproblem and what training data is available, some cost functions willConf. 6576 Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, UnsupervisedNanoBiomimetic Sensors and Neural Networks V340 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsslead to a better classifier design than others.  This leads to severalimplications that are discussed.  Several other criteria are analyzed inthe paper including the generic Lp norm for p greater than or equal tozero.  In addition, a finiteversion of the theory is presented that bridgesthe gap between asymptotic theory where the assumption is that thenumber of training samples goes to infinitity and strictly finitesizetraining sets.657625, Session 11Fault tolerant adaptive routing for heterogeneousnetworked embedded systemsX. Huang, C. Liang, Worcester Polytechnic Institute J. Ma, AirSpriteTechnologies, Inc.Continued advances in semiconductor technologies are enabling agrowing number of compact physical devices to be imbued withcomputing and communications capabilities. As microprocessorscontinue to shrink, wireless radios are also becoming more powerfuland compact. Heterogeneous networked embedded systemscomprising a large number of sensing, computing, and communicationdevices are promising with unlimited applications. It also poses a hostof challenges qualitatively different from traditional standaloneembedded computers or mobile adhoc networks, because they will bemore tightly integrated with their environments, more autonomous, andmore constrained in resources. Since the wireless links could beunreliable and the processing nodes could be unavailable, faulttolerance becomes an important issue for networked embeddedsystems. In this paper, we address this issue by presenting a set ofadaptive routing algorithms for execution of distributive computingtasks. A turn model based adaptive algorithm is adopted and modifiedfor networked embedded systems. Turn model shows an acceptablelevel of fault tolerance with existence of disable nodes in the network.Furthermore, virtual channel technique is introduced to improve the faulttolerant capacity for data communications. For a largescale dataintensive collaborative computing task, the simulation demonstratesthat adaptive routing can significantly improves the fault tolerancecapacity and accommodate the dynamically changing networkedenvironment.657628, Session 11Hardware implementation of a neural vision systembased on a neural network using integrated and fireneuronsM. Gonzlez, H. Lamela, M. Jimnez, J. A. Gimeno, M. RuizLlata,Univ. Carlos III de Madrid SpainIn the high level capacity of parallel processing which biologicalsystems display, the connectivity which neurons possess isfundamental. Generally they use their action potential, or pulsations, totransmit the information between themselves, in this way increasing therobustness of the transmission. In the investigative work carried out onthe description of the activity of a population of pulse coupled neurons,the order of connections in such systems is technologically unfeasible,due not only to space requirements but also to power dissipation 1.In the study of different configurations determined by interconnections,simplifications have been demonstrated 48 connections per neuron,conditioning its activation or inhibition 2 or 59, where 48 act asactivators and the rest act as inhibitors under the action of a globalelement designed for this purpose 3. In order to simulate the high levelof connectivity, and inspired by the success of temporal multiplexing incommunications and computational networks, many investigators haveadopted this method to resolve the problems mentioned.If one wants to carry out this method with success, it is necessary todescribe the activity of a population of neurons with an ordered list ofthe spatial  temporal localization, where each coordinate specifies theoccurrence of an event in a particular position, within a determinedtime. The same localization may appear various times while one singletime can only occur once. Nevertheless, if this acquisition is carried outin fixed time spaces, acquiring only the position, the time will bedetermined by itself. This real time representation is called AddressEvent Representation AER 4.The elements used to generate the events, also denominatedintegration and trigger, integrate the current, directly or by the use of atransimpedance element, in such a way that when a determined value isreached a trigger is produced in the system, producing not onlydigitalization of the input signal but also we can generate a signal whichindicates that an event has occurred. Upon asking for access, it isnecessary to restart the system using the recognizing of the event. Thisway we also implement a synchronous protocol called Handshake 15.We present our work, which was carried out to implement the hardwarefor a vision system based on integrated neurons and Fire using aoptoelectronic processor developed within our group for imageprocessing 6 and using a PIC18F252 microcontroller, allowingmanagement of the events.REFERENCES1 D.

Amini, Southern Univ.The radio communication use in recent years has increasedsignificantly.  This increase has created a crowded spectrum.  To avoidinterference and spectral effectiveness in this crowded medium oneneeds to design a waveform for modulation of data far from theinterfering frequencies. One effective approach to identify the interferingfrequencies is by sampling the environment by both the transmitter andthe receiver.  The spectrum of the sampled environment will provide theavailable portion that is clear for transmission.  The effectiveness of thisapproach depends on an accurate estimation of the spectrum of theenvironment.  In some applications, the transmitter and receiver can notafford to sample the environment over a long time for accurateestimation of the spectrum since it impacts the amount of time that isavailable to transmitterreceiver for communication.  Thus, theenvironment is sampled over a short time.  This sampling amounts tomultiplication of the interfering signals by a narrow rectangle window.In the Fourier domain, this amounts to convolution of the FourierTransform of the interfering signals by a wide Sinc function.  Thebroadening effects of the convolution along with introduction of sidelobes may seriously limit the available portion of the spectrum forgeneration of the carrier signal.  In this paper, we propose to use theconstrained iterative spectral deconvolution to remove these effects.We will show that one period of the interfering signal is all that is needto successfully remove all side effects resulting from short time domainsampling of the environment.Conf. 6576 Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, UnsupervisedNanoBiomimetic Sensors and Neural Networks V spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 341657603, Session 13Technique of information hiding based on neural networkL. Xu, G. Tao, North China Institute of Science and TechnologyChinaA neural network algorithm is proposed which can conceal different fileseffectively such as .exe, .com, .doc, .txt and selfdefined file formats.First, the important contents of file are coded into a binary array. Thetotal number of 0 and 1 is N. Second, to make the neural network learnthe sample space, N pixel values and their closely relevant pixel valuesare randomly chosen from a color BMP format image and used to trainthe neural network, thus we get a group of network parameters and itsoutputs Y1. Each element of Y1 is increased 0 or 1 according to thezeros and ones from the array, the increased Y1 is called Y2. Third,using the transmitted parameters, a receiver can restore the neuralnetwork. Network outputs Y3 can also be obtained by simulating therestored neural network with the seed pixel values. Finally, theencrypted information can be decoded by Y2 and Y3.The acquisition of parameters and Y1 is different when the neuralnetwork is trained each time, so the algorithm has the characteristic ofonetime pad, which can enhance the correspondence security.Because the network colligates the chosen pixel values and theirclosely relevant pixel values, a cryptanalyst can not restore the networkparameters and Y3 easily. Without the seed picture and the password,he does not know the encrypted data even if he knows the networkparameters and Y2. If he only has the seed picture, he does not knowthe encrypted contents either, because there is no other information inthe picture, which just is used to train the network.Using the same algorithm, the fragile watermark can be embedded intoY1 simultaneously. Besides telling you whether Y2  or networkparameters has been tampered, the fragile watermark could as well,reflect the distortion status in spatial domain of the tampered image.Therefore, the proposed method is of significance in practice.657605, Session 13Research on the technique of public watermarkingsystem based on wavelet transform and neural networkL. Xu, G. Tao, North China Institute of Science and TechnologyChinaA hybrid algorithm of wavelet transform and neural network ispresented which solves the problems confronted in public watermarkingsystem. First, to get the wavelet coefficients, db1 wavelet is used todecompose the selected image. Second, to ensure a better quality ofthe marked image, some wavelet coefficients and their closely relevantwavelet coefficients are randomly selected from the wavelet coefficientsdecomposed by the low pass filter and used to establish the relationalmodel by using neural network. Third, a bit information of watermark isalso enlarged by increasing the amounts of zeros or ones and then a bitof the results is embedded by adjusting the polarity between a chosenwavelet coefficient and the output value of the model. Finally, a newimage with watermark information is reconstructed by using themodified wavelet coefficients and their relevant wavelet coefficients. Onthe other hand, the process of retrieving watermark is inverse accordingto the embedding process. The embedded watermark can also beretrieved by using the hybrid algorithm and the bits processed functionwithout knowing the original image and watermark. Experimental resultsshow that the proposed technique is very robust against some imageprocessing operations and JPEG lossy compression. Meanwhile, theextracted watermark can be proved by the embedding method.Attribute to the neural network, the proposed method is also robustagainst attack of false authentication. Therefore, the hybrid algorithmcan be used to protect the copyright of one important image.657606, Session 13Arrogance analysis of several typical pattern recognitionclassifiersJ. Chen, S. Xia, W. Hu, National Univ. of Defense Technology ChinaVarious kinds of classification methods have been developed. However,most of these classical methods, such as BackPropagation BP,Bayes method, Support Vector MachineSVM, SelfOrganizing MapSOM are arrogant.A human is being arrogant when their expressed conviction in adecision overstates their actual experience in making similar decisions,even is a mistake. We say that he is arrogant if he frequently makesarrogant decisions. Likewise, some classical pattern classifiersrepresent the similar characteristic of arrogance. Given an input featurevector, we say a classifier is arrogant in its classification if its veracity ishigh yet its experience is low. Typically, for a new sample which isdistinguishable from original training samples, traditional classifiersrecognize it as one of the known targets. Clearly, arrogance inclassification is an undesirable attribute.Conversely, a classifier is nonarrogant in its classification if there is areasonable balance between its veracity and its experience.Inquisitiveness is, in many ways, the opposite of arrogance. In nature,inquisitiveness is an eagerness for knowledge characterized by thedrive to question, to seek a deeper understanding. The human capacityto doubt present beliefs allows us to acquire new experiences and tolearn from our mistakes. Within the discrete world of computers,inquisitive pattern recognition is the constructive investigation andexploitation of conflict in information. Thus, we quantify this balanceand discuss new techniques that will detect arrogance in a classifier.Through analysis on arrogance of several classical pattern classifiers,Recursive SelfOrganizing Mapping RSOM based inquisitive patternrecognition IPR framework is advanced, which will allow one todetermine when a classifier is being arrogant. By compromisingbetween the arrogance and inquisitiveness, the new classifier canautonomously learn new discriminative patterns. The feasibility andvalidity of the method has been proven by several tests on radar targetrecognition and multipose object recognition.657612, Session 13Intellectual property protection of IP cores through highlevel watermarkingE. Castillo, Univ. de Granada Spain U. H. MeyerBse, FloridaState Univ. A. Garca, L. Parrilla, A. Lloris, Univ. de Granada SpainReusebased design methodologies allow to assemble complex systemusing smaller components, reducing system design complexity. Thesestrategies, based in the use of reusable modules or Intellectual PropertyIP cores, are enabling the optimization of company resources due tothe reduced development time and costs. However, sharing IP coresposes significant security risks, one of the main being the intellectualproperty protection of those shared modules. Design reuse has led tothe development of intellectual property protection techniques. It is inthis context where watermarking techniques come to get these goal.We propose a watermarking technique for IPP of FPGA bases systems.The aim is to protect the author rights of reusable IP cores by means ofa digital signature that uniquely identifies both the original design andthe design recipient. The proposed watermarking technique relies on aprocedure that spreads the digital signature in cells of lookup tables atHDL design level, not increasing the area of the system. This signatureis preserved through synthesis, placement and routing processes. Thetechnique includes a procedure for signature extraction requiringminimal modifications to the system. Thus, it is possible to detect theownership rights without interfering the normal operation of the systemand providing high invulnerability. To illustrate the properties of theproposed watermarking technique, both protected and unprotecteddesign examples are compared in terms of area and performance. Theanalysis of the results shows that the area increase is very low whilethroughput penalization is almost negligible.Conf. 6576 Independent Component Analyses, Wavelets, UnsupervisedNanoBiomimetic Sensors and Neural Networks V342 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss657616, Session 13Automatic target recognition method for phased antennaarrays with no passive training mode informationA. Bhargave, F. S. Lin, M. I. Kazantzidis, Broadata Communications,Inc.In this paper, a new selforganizing neural system with IndependentComponent Analysis  for automatic target recognition for phasedantenna arrays is developed. The existing target recognition schemeswith phased antenna arrays consists of passive mode which usessecondary information to estimate parameters which are then used inactive detection mode. The environment often changes andperformance suffers because of the mismatch between the activetesting mode and passive training mode. Hence we pose the targetrecognition problem as a challenging blind detection and recognitionproblem and develop a self organizing neural system for the phasedantenna array radar detection. The new system consist of IndependentComponent Analysis based selforganizing neural scheme. The task ofsignal extraction and separation is formulated as that of maximizing theobjective function of the mutual information between certain variablesof a neural system. We develop a techniques for adjusting the freeparameters synaptic weights of the system so as to optimize thismutual information. An unsupervised learning algorithm based onindependent component analysis is used where the objective of thelearning algorithm is to minimize the KullbackLeibler divergencebetween the probability density function of the output variables andtheir factorial distributions. This is then implemented using a gradientdescent method where the adjustment parameters are appropriatelyapplied to synaptic weights. We apply the scheme to automatic targetrecognition with phased antenna radar arrays to develop a systemwhich does not need secondary information or passive training mode.657649, Session 13Implicit differential analysis for cortical modelsF.

Shih, ChengShiu Univ. Taiwan K. Hsieh, Rightsym InternationalCompany TaiwanZigBee is a lowpower, shortdistance wireless standard that has greatpossibilities in applications from home automation to industrial control.ZigBee is also a wireless standard based on 802.15.4 that wasdeveloped to address the unique needs of most wireless sensing andcontrol applications. Key benefits of the 802.15.4 and ZigBee standardsinclude extended battery life over current wireless standards, mesh andstar network topologies, cost effectiveness, and no line of sight worries.In this paper we present an improvement approach of indoor locationsensing using ZigBee technology. This is a locationsupport systemusing ZigBee tag for inbuilding, mobile, locationdependentapplications. In our experiment, we place four ZigBee terminals at thefour corners of a 10 m10m square space, and then this 10 m10msquare area is divided to 10  10 small squares with 1m1m each. Weplace a ZigBee reference tag to this square array every 1 m insequentially. The average RSSI value delivered to the four ZigBeeterminals from this ZigBee tag will be recorded as a reference vector.When a tracking tag put into this square area, comparing the RSSIvalue of tracking tag delivered to the four ZigBee terminals and thereference vector established for this area, we can estimate where thetracking tag location is.The major advantage of this system is that it improves the overallprecision of locating objects by utilizing array of reference tags andsome mathematic algorithms. Although ZigBee is not designed forindoor location sensing, this algorithm can be used for indoor locationsensing, and added to make ZigBee technologies competitive in thisnew and growing market.657703, Session 1Adaptive binary signature design of code divisioncontrolledMAC in wireless sensor networkL. Wei, S. N. Batalama, D. A. Pados, Univ. at Buffalo B. W. Suter, AirForce Research Lab.Wireless sensor networks WSN are characterized by their architecture,severe energy constraints and asymmetric manytoone data flows. Inthis paper, we consider the problem of signature waveform design ofcode division controlledMAC in WSN. In contract to conventionalrandomly chosen orthogonal codes, an adaptive signature assignmentstrategy is developed under the maximum predetection SINR signal tointerference plus noise ratio criterion. The proposed algorithm utilizesslowest descent cords of the optimization surface to move toward theoptimum solution and exhibits polynomial computational complexitywith respect to signature length. Numerical and simulation studiesdemonstrate the performance of the proposed method and offercomparisons with the conventional signature assignment scheme.657704, Session 1Locationbased route selfrecovery for mobile ad hocnetworksS. R. Medidi, J. Wang, Washington State Univ.Mobile adhoc networks MANET consist of mobile computing deviceswhich communicate with each other through multihop wireless channelwithout the assistance of fixed infrastructures. The internetworkingflexibility of MANET comes with the cost of frequent topology changeswhich bring the challenges for its routing protocol design. Sourceinitiated routing alleviates the need for periodic topology updates, buthas the problems such as delay and broadcast storm.Frequent source discovery incur significant overhead and delay, oneapproach to avoid this is by using route selfrecovery techniques. Itrelies on the assumption that after a route to the destination nodebreaks, the new route cannot be significantly different than the mostrecently used route. Current route selfrecovery techniques introduceadditional overhead for broadcasting, updating link information, etc. Inthis paper, we propose a new sourceinitiated routing protocolcombining route selfrecovery and locationaided broadcast, which isadaptive to the dynamics in network topology and improves the routingoverhead and delay. It avoids reinitiating the route discovery and usesselective rebroadcasting to find a short detour and replace the brokenlinks for route maintenance.Broadcast storm problem has been addressed at MAC layer to preventunnecessary forwarding of duplicates while maintaining a goodbroadcast coverage. In contrast, our protocol addresses the broadcaststorm problem by initiating route selfrecovery phase at networkinglayer and can be used with any of these MAC layer broadcastingschemes to further improve its performance. Simulation results showimprovements in various aspects such as system throughput, routingoverhead, scalability, and usefulness.657705, Session 1Enhancing ad hoc routing with historybased routeselectionS. R. Medidi, P. M. Cappetto, Washington State Univ.Adhoc networks are fundamentally resource constrained in terms ofbattery, cost, and infrastructure, but are attractive for a wide variety ofapplications such as battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring,and emergency response. Battery impoverished nodes may selfishlyelect to not forward packets to conserve their energy. Selfish packetdropping degrades the performance of the network and results inincreased retransmissions. Selecting routes with fewer misbehavingnodes decreases the chance of surreptitious packet drops.The choice of protocols above and below the routing layer affects thedesign of the routing protocol. For example, systems that rely ondetecting whether or not their neighbors forward packets can use linklayer acknowledgments found in protocols such as 802.11. Securerouting can also use upper layer information from the transport layersuch as acknowledgments and timeouts. Our approach takes a moregeneric, layerindependent method that gathers evidence soley from therouting to provide improved performance in the presence ofmisbehaving nodes.Our approach uses locally collected information to select routes withnodes having the best aggregate performance. The packet counts from344 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssConf. 6577 Wireless Sensing and Processing IIboth data and control packets are gathered from the routing layer tohelp identify nodes with good past performance. Nodes use routes withthe best average node rating. Alternately, other route weightingschemes could easily be used. Simulation results using ns2 simulatorconfirm that there is a definite reduction in the routing overhead.Results indicate that the perconnection throughput has increased andthe aggregate number of packet drops have been reduced.657707, Session 2Approximate MLE algorithm for source localizationbased on TDOA measurementsG. Gu, Louisiana State Univ.Passive source localization has been an important research topic in thesignal processing society. This paper considers source localizationbased on TDOA timedifference of arrival measurements that has beenstudied extensively in the literature. Despite the fact that themeasurement noises are additive and Gaussian, such a sourcelocalization problem is nonlinear in nature and the exact MLE maximumlikelihood estimation solution is difficult to compute.In this paper we consider the same passive source localization problemusing the same quasilinear measurement equations. Different from theexisting solution methods, the nonlinear term in the quasilinearmeasurement equations is treated as a constraint which is in fact aquadratic constraint. A numerical procedure based on simultaneousdiagonalization is developed to compute the weighted LS LS solutionunder the quadratic constraint. This new procedure is shown to be anapproximate MLE solution under the assumption that the ratios of thedistances between all but one sensor and the target to the noisevariance in TDOA measurements are suitably large. The assumption israther mild and is satisfied so long as the relative distances among allthe sensors are suitably large and the noise variance is suitably smallwhich hold in practice for localization based on TDOA measurements.Our results are fairly complete and complement the existing ones in theliterature. The simulation results are worked out to illustrate theeffectiveness of the proposed solution procedures that comparefavorably with the existing results.657708, Session 2The constrained Kalman filtering and its application totracking of ground moving targetG. Gu, Louisiana State Univ.Passive source location is investigated based on measurements ofTDOA timedifference of arrival and AOA angle of arrival in which themeasurement noises are assumed to be uncorrelated and Gaussiandistributed. It also assumes the known knowledge of the positions andvelocities of all the UAV unmaned aerial vehicle sensors within the UAVsensor network. The research focus is estimation of the location andtracking of the GMT ground moving target that requires to estimateboth position and velocity of the GMT at each sampled time within thegiven time horizon. The underlying localization and tracking problem isnonlinear in nature for which MMSE minimum mean squarederror isdifficult to achieve. We aim to develop an approximate MMSE algorithmfor the underlying localization and tracking problem based on TDOAand AOA measurements. Based on the pseudomeasurement model inthe existing literature, a statespace model is derived that governs themotion of the GMT and the nonlinear term involved in this model istaken as a part of the state vector. It leads to a nonlinear constraintimposed on the state vector.Randomization of the state vector suggests to replace the hardconstraint by its expectation. We first derive a solution to a similarconstrained MMSE problem that is used to extend the Kalman filteringto develop a linear recursive MMSE estimator subject to the nonlinearconstraint as mentioned earlier which is termed as constrained Kalmanfiltering. A simulation example is carried out the case of two UAVsensors that demonstrate good localization and tracking results.657709, Session 2Direction finding of GPS receiver interference based on ahybrid RFDSP approachJ. Wang, M. G. Amin, Villanova Univ.GPS receivers are subject to jammers, which can assume differentwaveforms and locations. Jammers can compromise the GPS receiverperformance and disallow it to acquire or track the signals.  It is ofinterest to concurrently null and localize interferers.  While nulling canbe performed using adaptive techniques implementing LMS and basedon knowledge of satellite locations, high resolution direction of arrivalestimation can proceed using subspace and eigenstructure methods.Typically, interference mitigation is performed for each satelliteindependently using an adaptive spatial weight vector whose length isequal to the number of antennas. At convergence, these weight vectorsthemselves contain the interference bearing information, which can beextracted using subspace processing.  In this paper, we obtain theinterference angle of arrival by performing singular value decompositionto the adaptive weight matrix. This approach allows the adaptivejammer cancellation to be performed in RF and eliminates the need toseparately formulate the data covariance matrix for angle of arrivalestimation.657710, Session 2MIMObased performance enhancements in widebandrandom noise radar using adaptive beamforming andspatially distributed antennasW. Darsono, R. M. Narayanan, The Pennsylvania State Univ.Wideband signals have been used in radar systems for highresolutionsurveillance and imaging applications. The motivation for using awideband noise signal is that it offers improved spectral efficiency, i.e.,it permits multiple users to occupy and operate within the samefrequency band with minimal crossinterference. Random noise radarhas the inherent covert capability, i.e. the Low Probability of InterceptLPI and Low Probability of Detection LPD. By employing a randomnoise signal in wideband radar, we aim to exploit and combine bothadvantages. The recently developed multipleinput multipleoutputMIMO system is an architecture that employs multiple antennas atboth transmitter and receiver sides to exploit diversity and multipath forimproved system performance. In digital communications, MIMOsystems have been shown to resolve the bottleneck of traffic capacityof the network, and at the same time to exploit the spatial diversity. Thispaper shows the performance enhancement of MIMObased widebandnoise radar system configuration as opposed to the single antennaradar system. The system will also enjoy the inherent advantages ofusing the other technologies, i.e., covert feature of random noise signal,and spectral efficiency of wideband radar system. There are twodifferent antenna arrangements that can be proposed for suchconfiguration. The first configuration is when the radar antennas arecollocated. For this configuration, we will employ adaptive beamformingtechniques in order to properly combine the different waveformstransmitted from different transmitters and gathered by the antennareceivers. It will be shown that the radar system will benefit from thetransmitted signal recovery used to detect the target, and thus this willimprove the signal to noise ratio SNR of the overall system. Anotherconfiguration is when the radar antennas are spatially distributed. In thisconfiguration, we will show that the system will benefit of getting abetter radar cross section RCS of the intended detected target.

NaraghiPour, N. Tayem, Louisiana State Univ.In this paper, a new spectral direction of arrival DOA algorithm isproposed that can rapidly estimate the DOAs of noncoherent as wellas coherent incident signals. The proposed method constructs a date spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 345model which is based on a Hermition Toeplitz matrix whose rank isalways related to the DOA of incoming signals and cannot be effected ifthe incoming sources are noncoherent, partially correlated, or highlycorrelated fully coherent. In addition, our algorithm reconstructs thedata in a way that can extend the dimension of the noise space.Therefore, the signal and noise space can be estimated properly. Whenwe compared the proposed method with the wellknown classicalsubspace algorithms, such as MUSIC, Matrix Pencil MP and ESPRITalgorithm, the proposed method has several advantages. First, theproposed method does not require multiple snapshots but a singlesnapshot observation to estimate DOAs. Hence, it is attractive for realtime applications. Second, no forwardbackward spatial smoothing forthe covariance matrix is needed, whereas the MUSIC and ESPRITmethods require it, which increases the computational load and is timeconsuming. Third, the proposed method can detect the coherentsources, whereas the wellknown MUSIC and ESPRIT methods cannot.The simulation results verify that the proposed method gives moreaccurate estimation and superior performance than the ESPRITalgorithm.657712, Session 3Decoderaided multidata detection of OFDMCDMAwaveforms on HF multipathfading channelsJ.

Choudhary, A. L. Robinson, Univ. of MemphisIn this paper we compare Ultrawideband UWB channel modelsobtained using model selection techniques and hypothesis testing.Unlike narrow band communication, the assumption of Rayleighchannel for UWB communications is not always valid due to the widebandwidths. We first investigate the distribution of UWB channel tapmagnitudes using model selection techniques such as Accumulativepredictive error APE, Akaike information criterion AIC, and Bayesianinformation criterion BIC. To our knowledge APE has not been appliedbefore for channel modeling. The model selection techniques act asmetrics to identify how close a candidate distribution is to the trueunknown distribution. The channel models are also estimated usingKolmogorovSmirov hypothesis testing.  Rayleigh, Weibull, Lognormaland Rician distributions form the candidate distribution models. Thedistributions chosen by the above mentioned techniques are presented.The pros and cons associated with each technique for channelmodeling are examined.

Huang, I. M. Panahi, The Univ. of Texas at DallasDigital fingerprinting is an available method that can identify thecustomer or owner of the digital media image, video, etc and protectthe copyright of the content providers. Fingerprinting system embeds aunique fingerprint, which is the identity of the owner, into each individualcopy of the original content. The monitor can detect the original user ofthe legal copies and track the usage of the copyrighted media contentand analyze the spread of the content. The most serious problem tofingerprinting is how to resist the effective attackcollusion. Collusionis to use some different marked copies of the same original content andgenerate a new version from which the detector cant regain the correctfingerprint. In this paper we use combinatorial theory and constructnonlinear DBBD Differential Balanced Block Design code as fingerprintfor digital media. The code is collusionsecure and has the capability oferror correction which is beneficial to the robustness of the fingerprint.We also present a scheme for combining this collusionsecurefingerprinting code with a multiresolution wavelet based watermarkingmechanism. We use waveletwatermarking techniques to embed andextract the fingerprints, and then use our detection scheme and theerror correction ability of the DBBD code to find the pirates.Experiments show good performance of the scheme.657721, Session 4RFID electronic seal and system using the RFIDelectronic sealS. Shih, ChengShiu Univ. TaiwanTo fulfill the demand of logistics, the goods after being manufacturedare put into the supply chain. The most important information to boththe supplier and the customer is the location of the goods in the supplychain management.  Current cargo tracking systems use an ICintegrated circuit card and GPS global positioning system or mobilephone system to monitor the location of the cargo truck, providing thecargo owner with the information of the number of the license plate ofthe cargo truck, the code number of the cargo container, the currentlocation of the cargo truck, etc. It is, however, impossible to knowwhether the cargo container is opened andor the cargo in the cargocontainer is stolen or switched, nor to prevent such events.RFID radio frequency identification electronic seals are proposed tosolve the above problems.  A typical electronic seal has a structuresimilar to a combination lock to seal the rear door of a cargo truck,allowing the owner of the cargo to acquire the required information.The owner will notice in real time after unauthorized breakage of theRFID electronic seal.   In this work, we present a lowcost and reliableRFID electronic seal that provides evidence once broken by anunauthorized person. Another objective of the present invention is toprovide a reliable RFID electronic seal for sealing a cargo container orfor tightening other goods.  We also present a reliable tracking systemusing an RFID electronic seal so that the owner of a cargo or goods canbe aware of the position of the cargo or goods carrier and status of thecargo or goods as well as breakage of the RIFD electronic seal in realtime.657714, Session 5Sensor networks and network sensibilityM. Li, Univ. of Waterloo Canada H. Lin, J. A. Rushing, S. J. Graves,The Univ. of AlabamaHuntsvilleNetworks with densely distributed inexpensive microsensors arebecoming a reality for monitoring and tracking objects of interest over avery large geographical area in both military and civilian applications.The sensibility of a sensor network depends strongly on how well theregion is covered by the sensors and how much and how accurate theinformation each individual sensor can provide. In case of the primitivesensor networks where each sensor can only provide limitedinformation not sufficient to locate the target, sensor network density oflarger than two is needed. Taking into account the low fidelity of thesensors, this number gets larger in order to provide the desiredaccuracy and robustness against sensor failures. The question of howdensely the sensors should be distributed is crucial in designing anddeploying large scale sensor networks. In this paper, the problem ofhow many randomly distributed sensors are needed over a region isaddressed analytically with the incompressibility method rather than thetraditional probabilistic approach. Under the truly Kolmogorov randomdistribution, the upper and lower bounds of the numbers of sensorsneeded to guarantee 100 that every location of the region of interestcan be sensed by at least k sensors are formulated and proved, andverified with experimental simulations. Here, k is a predefined valuebased on the characteristics of sensors and the requirement of networkdelectability.657715, Session 5A simple hillclimbing technique to place sensors in apolygonal area for increased intrution detection in thepresence of a cognizant intruderS.

Valin, A. Guitouni, E. Bosse, Defence RD CanadaValcartierCanada H. Wehn, R. Yates, H. H. Zwick, MacDonald, Dettwiler Associates Ltd. CanadaDRDC Valcartier has initiated  through a PRECARN partnership project the development of an advanced simulation testbed for the purpose ofevaluating the effectiveness of Network Enabled Operations NEOps in acoastal large volume surveillance situation. The main topics studied aredistributed information fusion architectures and dynamic resources andnetworks configuration management. This article presents therequirements, design and first implementation builds of the testbed, andreports on some selected preliminary results. The testbed allows tomodel distributed nodes performing information fusion, dynamic resourcemanagement planning and scheduling, as well as configurationmanagement, given multiple constraints on the resources and theircommunications networks. Two situations are being simulatedcooperative and noncooperative target search. A cooperative surfacetarget behaves in ways to be detected e.g., rescued, while an elusivetarget attempts to avoid detection. The simulation consists of anetworked set of surveillance assets including aircraft UAVs, helicopters,maritime patrol aircrafts, ships, fixed sensors, ground stations andsatellites.  These assets have scanning radar, electrooptical, infrared andimaging radar capabilities. Since full data sharing over most real worldlinks is not feasible, ownplatform data fusion must be simulated toevaluate implementation and performance of distributed informationfusion. A special emphasis is put on higherlevel fusion concepts usingknowledgebased rules, with level 1 fusion already providing tracks.Surveillance platform behavior is also simulated in order to evaluatedifferent dynamic resource management algorithms. Additionally,communication networks are modeled to simulate different informationexchange concepts. The testbed allows the evaluation of a range ofcontrol strategies from independent platform search, through variouslevels of platform collaboration, up to a centralized control of searchplatforms.  The testbed is being implemented by MDA Inc., Actenum Inc.,Simon Fraser University and the University of Calgary.657803, Session 1An evaluation of casebased classification to supportautomated web service discovery and brokeringE. G. Warner, R. V. Ladner, F. Petry, Naval Research Lab.In this paper we evaluate the use of casebased classification to resolvea number of questions related to information sharing in the context of anIntegrated Web Services Brokering System IWB.  We are developing theIWB to provide automated synchronization with internetintranet WebServices data providers for client applications.  Our approach isintended to support automated discovery of relevant Web Services,automated mediation of client requests and automated transformationof requests and corresponding responses.There has been much interest in the use of ontologies such as OWLSto support Web Services discovery.  This approach usually involves aweb services deployment of an ontology that semantically describesthe service.  The ontology is intended to provide a means forprospective clients to identify whether the services capabilities matchthe clients requirements.  In contrast to this approach, we use casebased classification as a means of automating the IWBs recognition ofrelevant services and operations.  Casebased classification retrievesand reuses decisions based on training data.  We use sample WebService Description Language WSDL files and schema from actualweb services as training data in our approach and do not require theservice to predeploy an OWLS ontology.  We present our evaluation ofthis approach and performance ratings in the context of meteorologicaland oceanographic MetOc Web Services as it relates to the IWB.657804, Session 1Enabling dynamic interoperability with multiple COIsystemsE.

Solving thisissue requires that each network element platform, commander, warfighter, etc. be able to span, dynamically join and leave different COIsystems as operational requirements dictate.The COI Interoperability Agent CIA is the centerpiece of our solution.The Boeing Company in conjunction with the Air Force ResearchLaboratory has developed the CIA concept as a part of EnablingCommand and Tactical Element Dynamic Interoperability with MultipleCOI Systems, which will be demonstrated in December 2006.  It willenable each battle space entity to join, interact with, and leave multipleCOIs. Each CIA consists of a common core containing the InformationRouter, COI Initiator COIN factory, and Platform Initiator PIN factorycomponents along with one or more platform modules and COImodules.  Bidirectional information flow is directed by the InformationRouter.  The COIN enables dynamic connection to a COI. A COINconsists of two parts 1 a Java Jar file containing the COI Module codeestablishing a COI connection and 2 a data component that configuresthe COI Module. The CIA uses the COIN factory to load and configurenew COI Modules.  The PIN factory fills a similar role for PlatformModules.  The Platform Module contains code to link to a specifictactical entity. The CIA concept provides a path for the warfighter todynamically connect to multiple COIs without a priori knowledge ofCOIs that will be needed.657805, Session 1An investigative analysis of information assurance issuesassociated with the GIGs PP architectureB. S. Farroha, R. Cole, Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. D.Farroha, Defense Intelligence AgencyThe Global Information Grid GIG is a collection of systems, programsand initiatives aimed at building a secure network and set of informationcapabilities modeled after the Internet. The GIG is expected to facilitateDoDs transformation by allowing warfighters, policy makers, andsupport personnel to engage in rapid decision making. The roadmap isdesigned to take advantage of converged services of voice, data, video,348 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssand imagery over common data links. The vision is to havecommanders identify threats more effectively, make informed decisions,and respond with greater precision and lethality.  The informationadvantage gained through the GIG and networkcentric warfare NCWallows a warfighting force to achieve dramatically improved informationpositions, in the form of common operational pictures that provide thebasis for shared situational awareness and knowledge, and a resultingincrease in combat power.The GIG Precedence and Preemption PP requirements stem from theneed to utilize scarce resources at critical times in the most effectiveway in support of national security, the intelligence community and thewarfighter.  Information Assurance IA enables all information and datato be available endtoend to support any mission without delay inaccordance to the sensitivity of the task. Together, PP and IA ensuredata availability integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.This study addresses and analyzes the QoS and P  P requirementsand architecture for the GIG.   Threat scenarios are presented and usedto evaluate the reference architectures.  The goal of the study is toassess the Information Assurance concerns associated withimplementing Precedence and Preemption within the GIG and toguarantee an acceptable minimum level of security and protection forDoD networks.657806, Session 1Embedded instrumentation systems architectureN. A. Visnevski, P. C. Sanza, GE Global ResearchMilitary systems in the new century are becoming increasingly complex,network centric, and information intensive.  Existing adhoc test andevaluation TE approaches are facing increasing challenges to copewith these complexities.  This paper describes the operational conceptof the Embedded Instrumentation Systems Architecture EISA that isbeing developed for Test and Evaluation TE applications and isintended to address many of the current TE challenges.  Thearchitecture addresses such future TE requirements as interoperability,flexibility, and nonintrusiveness.  These are the ultimate requirementsthat support continuous TE objectives that are essential for defensetransformation and networkcentric warfare principles.In this paper, we demonstrate that these objectives can be met bydecoupling the Embedded Instrumentation EI system into an anboardand an offboard component.  An onboard component is responsiblefor sampling, preprocessing, buffering, and transmitting data to the offboard component.  The latter is responsible for aggregating, postprocessing, and storing test data as well as providing access to thedata via a clearly defined interface including such aspects as security,user authentication and access control.The power of the EISA architecture approach is in its inherent ability tosupport virtual instrumentation as well as enabling interoperability withsuch important TE systems as Integrated NetworkEnhancedTelemetry iNET, Test and Training Enabling Architecture TENA andother relevant Department of Defense initiatives.657807, Session 1Widely distributed C4ISRD. A. Goughnour, M. J. Salonish, S. D. Allen, ElanTech, Inc.Advances in networking and communications make the dream of ahighly connected mobile war fighter, persistent networked sensors, anddistributed command and control a reality. However, being able tocommunicate is only the first part of the problem. The ability to easilycommunicate with a wide variety of highly distributed sensors andsystems presents significant new problems that need to be addressed.First, an application must discover what services are available andestablish communications with the desired services. Secondly, timesynchronization across all of the networked systems is critical tocorrectly correlating the information into a coherent picture. In addition,maintaining data consistency in a highly distributed environment is anextremely challenging problem. Given the amount of data availableclients must be able to subscribe to specific data in order to avoidinformationsystem overload. Finally the information must be presentedto the user in a form and on a platform well suited to the task at hand.All of these problems, and many more, must be solved in order todeliver a truly effective netcentric C4ISR system.A software architecture will be presented that attempts to solve theissues described above. The architecture inherently includes manyfeatures designed to address these issues. In addition, the user canselect data from a wide variety of services, both local and remote andcontrol how it is accessed, processed, and displayed. A detailedanalysis of each of these techniques and how it impacts theeffectiveness of the system will be discussed.657808, Session 1Methodology for assessing technologies to improve orcompress the kill chainD. K. Bowley, C. Standford, S. James, Defence Science andTechnology Organisation AustraliaOffensive Support OS modelling has generally not been implementedwithin a closed simulation in such a way that its contribution to theoverall mission performance can be captured, measured and integrated.  However the issue of realistically measuring OS performancebecomes more critical as new technologies are proposed to improve orcompress the kill chain, particularly in the context of complexenvironments.  A study is   being conducted to determine andimplement an explicit kill chain in CASTFOREM such that it can beconfigured to use a variety of components and its impact onperformance can be measured and compared.   To assess the kill chainsix Measures of Performance have been adopted from the RoyalAustralian Air Force.  These are Timeliness, Appropriateness, Precision,Discrimination, Orchestration and Survivability, referred to as TAPDOS.These MoP will allow the study to align with accepted standards of OSusage in the Australian joint fires environment, to facilitate the use ofSunbject Matter Experts to support the study and promulgateperformance results.  The outcome of the study will be an enhancedCASTFOREM simulation capable of identifying and reporting specifickill chain events and measures associated with the target performancedemands, system performance availability, system selection andperformance delivered.657809, Session 2Evaluating technologies for tactical informationmanagement in netcentric systemsD. C. Schmidt, Vanderbilt Univ.Future DoD operations will run in netcentric systems characterized bythousands of platforms, sensors, decision nodes, actuators, andoperators connected through heterogeneous networks to exploitinformation superiority and achieve mission objectives. The networks,operating systems, middleware, and applications that populate thisenvironment offer many configuration points for adjusting their resourcerequirements and the quality of service QoS they deliver. For example,the Global Information Grid GIG is intended to organize and coordinatethis technology space to provide DoD planners and warfighters with theright data to the right place at the right time across enterpriseoperational systems and battlefield tactical systems. The enterpriseportion of the GIG relies on commercial Web Services standards,however, that do not yet address the realtime QoS requirements ofDoD tactical information management.To build and evolve tactical information management systems, it isnecessary to develop standardsbased QoSenabled publishsubscribepubsub platforms that enable participants to publish information theyhave and subscribe to information they need in timely manner. Sincethere is little evaluation of the ability of these platforms to meet theperformance needs of tactical information management, this paperprovides two contributions 1 it describes common architectures forthe OMG Data Distribution Service DDS, which is a standard QoSenabled pubsub platform and 2 it evaluates implementations of thesearchitectures to compare their performance with each other and withother pubsub middleware. Our results show that DDS implementationsConf. 6578 Defense Transformation and NetCentric Systems 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 349perform significantly better than nonDDS alternatives and are wellsuited for certain classes of datacritical tactical informationmanagement.657810, Session 2Dynamic policy enforcement in JBI informationmanagement services with the KAoS policy and domainservicesJ. Donnelly, J. Madden, ISX Corp. J. M. Bradshaw, A. Uszok,Institute for Human and Machine CognitionPolicy descriptions are increasingly being used to express rules andconstraints for software systems and enforced dynamically by policymanagement systems.  In this paper, we describe the application of onesuch policy management system, KAoS, to the control of distributedinformation management services defined by the Air Force ResearchLaboratorys Joint Battlespace Infosphere JBI program.  Our researchhas defined the policy ontologies necessary to describe the desiredlimits on the behavior of the participants in the system, both human andsoftware, with one set of welldefined policies.  At the same time, wehave implemented the policy decision points PDPs and policyenforcement points PEPs necessary to implement distributedinterpretation and enforcement of those policies.  As a result, a singleset of tools for the definition, analysis, control, and monitoring of policycan be used to implement access control, service configuration, servicedelivery prioritization, and control of simple software agents known asfuselets.657811, Session 2A QoS management system for dynamicallyinteroperating netcentric systemsJ. P. Loyall, J. Ye, P. Sharma, R. E. Schantz, BBN TechnologiesEffective networkcentric warfare requires information exchange withsuitable quality of service QoS to meet the warfighters needs.Information delivered too late or with the wrong resolution, form, orprecision can be insufficient for the user to perform his role in awarfighting scenario. One of the key characteristics of netcentricwarfare environments, as instantiated by the Global Information GridGIG, is dynamic reconfiguration and interoperability, in whichCommunities of Interest COIs can be formed and reformeddynamically to respond to realtime threats and unfolding situations.There is a need for a QoS management capability that can support thedynamic interoperability and realtime requirements of netcentricwarfare. In order to be effective, this QoS management capability mustmanage the production, delivery, and consumption of information withinavailable resources, mediate competing demands for resources, andadjust to dynamic conditions. In this paper, we describe the architecturefor a QoS Management Service QMS that works alongside InformationManagement Systems IMSs in dynamic COIs. The QMS provides QoSmanagement including resource management and quality ofinformation management in dynamically changing, mission drivenenvironments for interoperating assets within a COI and for assets andresources shared between COIs. The QMS provides mechanisms forQoS policy specification, QoS enforcement and monitoring, dynamicresource allocation, and application adaptation in dynamic COIs. It isbased on a layered architecture that maps mission requirements to QoSpolicies and enforcement. We describe the QMS architecture, prototypeimplementation, demonstration, and evaluation. Based on theseexperiences, we also discuss future research directions.657812, Session 2AIMS taking on roles to support information dominanceP. J. Ceccio, Northrop Grumman Corp.Military solutions to enable information sharing are being developedthat will fundamentally change future concepts of operation.  Thedevelopment of sophisticated approaches to managing this informationis a key element to reliably disseminate valued information to thetactical edge.  This paper will describe the merging of the Air ForceResearch Labs AFRL Joint Battlespace Infosphere ReferenceImplementation JBIRI and the Northrop Grumman AdvancedInformation Architecture AIAtm to support these tactical edge users.The newly formed product is called the Advanced InformationManagement System AIMS.The resulting technology, rooted in a service oriented approach,provides a managed information dissemination approach through theuse of publish, subscribe, and query services.  Information can becollected and shared among Communities of Interest COI withoutspecific involvement from the tactical users.Persistence via archiving to repositories, is a new capability added tothe existing AIAtm.  Extreme care is taken to effective manage theinformation within this dynamic environment. For example, Informationresulting from queries and subscriptions is cached to mitigate potentialbandwidth challenges at critical location within the system.AIMS  improves security by allowing the establishment of roles forretrievalpublishing of information. The access to information iscontrolled not only at the message level but also by specified elementswithin the metadata tags.Lastly, the fortification of AIMS with Web Services allows for a highlycohesive loosely coupled design.  Use of a Universal Description,Definition, and Integration UDDI describes and registers services in thearchitecture.  The UDDI allows implementations outside of AIMS 3rdparty to invoke any of the registered services for use within  their ownapplications.657813, Session 2Managing information sharing in tactical environmentsJ. P. Hanna, V. T. Combs, Air Force Research Lab.In the battlefield environments, new tactical radios that support wirelessInternet Protocol IP are being developed.  Interim solutions to enableIP over existing tactical links are in the process of being deployed.Ubiquitous IPbased interconnectivity will fundamentally change theway that our current soldiers and systems share data. The expectedproliferation of tactical sensor assets and nontraditional ISR assets willbring unprecedented volumes of data to the battlefield.  Sophisticatedapproaches to managing this data, rapidly transforming it intoactionable information, and reliably disseminating it to the war fighter,are the current foci of our research.  This paper will present an inhouseresearch project, named, Hydra, that is developing informationmanagement approaches targeted at addressing a specific set ofchallenges expected to be encountered in tactical deployment.  Webegin by describing the architecture of Hydra and the service orientedmodel that it provides.  Then, we discuss the initial build of Hydra,codenamed Dino, which addresses endtoend publication andsubscription of Managed Information Objects MIOs over intermittent orotherwise disrupted communications infrastructures. Two differentdeployment approaches for Dino are contrasted and performancemetrics are presented and discussed.  Next, results of initial testing onTCPIP networks over 2.4GHz 802.11 and 900MHz modems arepresented.  Finally, we describe the research objectives of the nextplanned build, codenamed BammBamm, and its expectedcapabilities.  We close the paper with a broader perspective for thefuture research goals of Hydra and briefly discuss our vision of TacticalInformation Dominance.657814, Session 2iFUSE a development environment for composable,easytoassemble information transformsR. A. Joyce, Architecture Technology Corp.New YorkA crucial component of a netcentric information management systemis a set of simple programs or scripts  fuselets  that effect smalltransformations on available data.  Individual fuselets can perform taskssuch as filtering, aggregation, monitoring, format conversion, andsimple image manipulation.  The global effect of a collection ofcooperating fuselets is to add value to the system to transform datainto knowledge.  Fuselets are also adept at bridging heterogeneousConf. 6578 Defense Transformation and NetCentric Systems 2007350 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdsssystems, providing consumers the data they need in the format theyrequire  not necessarily the format that was convenient for the originaldata producer.  ATCNY has created an extensible fuselet developmentenvironment, iFUSE, that provides the support fuselet developers needin order to create and discover fuselets, avoid design and efficiencypitfalls, and ensure the appropriate factorization of fuselet code.  Forthe individual fuselet, iFUSE lets the user focus on the information beingtransformed, not the code needed to implement the transformation.iFUSE also helps the designer understand the environment in which thefuselet operates, automatically detecting potential data flow problemsand providing visualization tools such as fuselet slicing, which allowsfuselet authors and infosphere maintainers to assess the effects ofadditions and changes in context.  In this talk, we review theaccomplishments and lessons learned from the recentlycompletediFUSE research and development effort and present promising futuredirections for fuselet research.657815, Session 2Semantic mediation and transformation servicesJ. R. Milligan, Air Force Research Lab.Semantic interoperability is becoming an increasingly importantproblem as user communities seek to interact over and acrossinformation spaces such as those that ride on the Global InformationGrid GIG.  Semantic interoperability can be defined as the ability oftwo or more systems services to exchange data on the basis of anagreed vocabulary ontology that guarantees the same interpretationsemantics or meaning of notions concepts and their interrelationshipsfor the users of the interoperating systems. Semanticallyaware crossdomain information and service mediation capabilities are needed toimprove interactions between Communities of Interest COIs and theapplications that service them.  One goal is to augment systems andservices with flexible information transformation capabilities that aredynamically responsive to changing enduser needs without imposingmajor impacts to existing and legacy systems. These capabilitiesproduce quality information that is of value to the context of the enduser through information assessment, correlation, aggregation, andother mediation services.  This leads to an improvement in theefficiency and effectiveness of decisionmakers by transforming a seaof data into actionable information.  Another goal is to provide agilemediation services between applications and services to promotedevicelevel interoperability between operational and tacticalinformation producers and consumers.  This leads to informationexchange that may be transparent to people but critical to the successof processes and workflows needed to accomplish the mission of joint,coalition, and multiagency operations.  Semantic representations ofindividuals, systems, services, processes, domains, and organizationsand the relationships between them are foundational to agileinformation transformations that enable dynamic mediation servicesand interoperability.  Planned and current areas of investigation includepedigree management, transformation logic production and executionenvironments, mediation service workflow orchestration, andontological contextualization of information.  This paper describes ongoing and future areas of research being conducted by the Air ForceResearch Laboratory located in Rome, NY.657816, Session 2Pedigree management and assessment in a netcentricinformation management environmentM. M. Gioioso, D. McCullough, C. Marceau, R. A. Joyce,Architecture Technology Corp.New YorkModern Defense strategy and execution is increasingly netcentric anddistributed, allowing more information to be made available in a timelymanner.  In this environment, the commander or warfighter mustdistinguish decisionquality information from potentially inaccurate, oreven conflicting, pieces of information collected from multiple sources.If the decisionmaker had access to information about the sources ofthe information as quickly and easily as to the information itself, hecould make quick and informed decisions based on the availableresources.The Pedigree Management and Assessment Framework PMAFenables the publisher of information to record standard pedigree, suchas information about the source, manner of collection, and the chain ofmodification of that information as it passed through other processingor assessment.  In addition, the publisher can define and include otherrelated information relevant to quality assessment, such as domainspecific information about sensor accuracy or organizational structureof agencies.  PMAF stores this potentially enormous amount ofinformation in a volumeefficient manner and presents the informationto the user in an intuitive graphical format, together with PMAFgenerated assessments that allow the user to quickly estimateinformation quality.  PMAF has been created for a netcentricinformation management system it can access pedigree informationacross communitiesofinterest and across network boundaries and willbe implemented in a Web Services environment.  Currently, we havedemonstrated volumeefficiency, extensibility of pedigree content, andthe ability to reach across different protocols to gather information tosupport quality decisions.657817, Session 2Composition modeling framework CMFG. R. Staskevich, J. R. Milligan, Air Force Research Lab.In 1999, the Committee to Assess the Policies and Practices of theDepartment of Energy DOE characterized stovepipe systems assystems procured and developed to solve a specific problem,characterized by a limited focus and functionality, and containing datathat cannot be easily shared with other systems.   Traditionally,software systems werent built with interoperability in mind primarilybecause there was no immediate need for different systems to talk toeach other.  The introduction of ARPANET in the late 1960s marked thebeginning of the Internet as we know it today,   and over the evolutionof information technology since then, organizations and people have anincreasing desire to use information in ways not possible thirty yearsago.  Since people often use the Internet to get and share information, itstands to reason that they might also desire the software applicationsthat they use in their daily activities to get and share information overthe network with the software applications of the other people theywork with.  Just as communication over the network would not bepossible without adherence to common networking protocols andstandards, we suggest that the dynamic sharing of information betweensoftware applications on behalf of the people working together andusing them will not be possible until standardsbased informationsharing protocols and methods are established for Communities ofInterest COIs.  For our purposes, we define a COI as the collection ofpeople and systems that are concerned with the exchange ofinformation and data to achieve a common goal.   To help enabledynamic information sharing between one software application andanother without hardcoding specific brittle interfaces, it is ourproposition that the envisioned information sharing protocols will needto be based in part on the ability to describe and encode machinereadable representations of the meaning of the data that needs to beexchanged and translated between the applications that serve one ormore COIs. This article will describe a method we apply using currentinternet and semantic web technologies including XML , XML Schema ,and OWL  in a prototype developed for the semiautomated generationof semantic models of COI information spaces.  Providing a semanticunderstanding of COI information spaces to software applicationsthrough use of such models is the next logical step in trying to meet theultimate challenge of making extinct the stovepipe systems that are stillin such rich abundance today.  Specifically presented is a CompositionModeling Framework CMF and prototype implementation thatdemonstrates the CMF method to capture the structure, meaning andabstract implementation of the underlying information space thatservices a COI, providing a basis for dynamic interoperability betweensoftware applications which are designed or augmented to usesemantic protocols.Conf. 6578 Defense Transformation and NetCentric Systems 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 351657818, Session 3CUGSS communicationsG.

The primary goal isto enable and enhance threat detection, validation and mitigation forfuture battlespace and battlespace situational awareness operations bygraphical game theory and advanced knowledge infrastructures forinformation fusion. To achieve this goal, we will develop a frameworkthat consists of three closely coupled systems 1 An advancedInformation Manager automates the processing and integration ofinformation from disparate sources to produce an integrated objectstate for use by a multihypothesis track grouping capability thatidentifies groups of cooperating objects which are performing commontasks.

In this paper,we will assess the throughput performance of four 802.11g wirelessnetwork interface cards NIC performing in adhoc mode and in anoutdoor environment.  This assessment is based on characteristics ofNICs, such as chipset, amplification, and antenna diversity over variousoperating distances.

Ganguly, S. Finn, J. McLamb, W. Bynoe, L. Veytser, I. Pedan, S.A. Davidson, MIT Lincoln Lab.The concept of NetworkCentric Warfare NCW has gained wideacceptance as a transformational effort within the Department ofDefense. The Airborne Network Definition AND project is a researcheffort aimed at defining and proving a highly capable battlefield networkarchitecture, enabling seamless data sharing between elements. Thenetwork is designed to be missiondefined and seeks to enhancewarfighting capabilities by providing new and improved pathways toshare data.One of the key components in the goal of achieving NCW capability isthe development of the Small Combat Network SCN architecture.Roughly speaking, an SCN os the network infrastructure deployed in asingle battle unit, and its associated connections to backboneinfrastructure. The SCN shouldProvide highly connected data pathways between the SCN membersfor tactical data exchange. Be mission oriented, and designed for thecombat environment. Be selfcontained and not dependent on theGlobal Information Grid GIG, but should provide connectivity to theGIG when availableneeded. Be a transitional step toward IPconverged reliable battlefield connectivity, while still leveraging legacysystems.Our goal is to develop an endtoend network architecture, with aspecific focus on developing an effective SCN architecture. Thearchitecture provides reliable connectivity, topology, routing and controlalgorithms for achieving the network design.The architecture must network surface, air and space segments, whichvariously contain fighting platforms, fighting support platforms,command and control infrastructure, and telecommunicationinfrastructure. The key technical contribution of the AND effort isovercoming the heterogeneity of the communicating entities inside thetheater.This paper presents the SCN architecture we are developing, andhighlights its features and key design choices. We describe an exampleof an operation that the proposed SCN architecture supports, and howthe network is instantiated inside the scenario. We show simulationresults in terms of Measures of Performance MOPs and Measures ofEffectiveness MOEs of actual warfighting applications. Our resultsshow that the proposed architecture supports key data sharing in thisoperation that tangibly enhance warfighting capabilities.

The Improving WarFighting Effectiveness through Integrationof a Tactical Strike Fighter with the Global Information Grid or GIG Clientprogram was undertaken to carryout the DOD goal of GIGenablingweapon systems. The technology was demonstrated through liveflighttest flights using the Boeing Companys F15E aircraft flying on two testflights in early February 2006.Through the developed GIG Client technology, a liveflight F15E aircraftwas connected with the GIG via its fielded Link16 network and an offboard agent called the Platform Adaptor.

E. Santos, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.While much work in NCONCW has focused on developing thecomponents based on information sharing and cross awareness e.g.conceptual models for cooperability and the common operating pictureCOP, the lynchpin is a robust network infrastructure. However, little isknown about the overall effectiveness and performance of NCONCWnetworks in general. Determining how robust or stable an existinginfrastructure network will be and to pinpoint weaknesses or faultinessis an important and critical concern, especially since these networksneed to be able to be employed in an adaptive and dynamicenvironment. Determining if an existing NCONCW networkinfrastructure is indeed robust and reliable is a major undertaking due tothe inherently largescale and complex nature of interaction. Employingtheoretical models which can be used to analyze and predictperformance e.g. scalability, reliability, etc is particularly important inorder to design a realistically deployable network.As such, in this paper we will present the design of a rigoroustheoretical framework to assess and predict the effectiveness andperformance of networks and their loads for deployment in NetworkCentric Operations NCO and Network Centric Warfare NCW. Theframework is imbued with the ability to pinpoint bottlenecks andsuggest corrections and modifications leading to more effective anddeployable networks.

Narayanan, The Pennsylvania State Univ.To support network centric operations for battlespace surveillance,communication technologies are heavily dependent on effectivesynchronization mechanisms. We consider multiple separately locatedradar system nodes that configure a covert communication channelbetween the nodes using random noise signals. Such radars form aneffective networkcentric system that has intrinsic properties such aslow probability of intercept LPI and low probability of detection LPD,along with its data dissemination capabilities. The idea of usingfrequencynotched noise spectra combined with embedded OFDMConf. 6578 Defense Transformation and NetCentric Systems 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 353data symbols as a communications signal between noise radars hasalready been demonstrated. However, its performance is severelylimited due to the fact that this noisedata signal is affected byfrequencyoffsets and timing offsets. The receiver in such systemsdepends heavily on the IDFT window for detecting the OFDM symbolsembedded in the noise waveform. Synchronization errors bringunwanted noise into this window in the form of ISI, ICI, etc. It thereforebecomes crucial that these errors are corrected before decoding theincoming signal. In this paper, we propose unique packet detection andtiming estimation techniques for the noisedata signal used forcommunications between the random noise radars. These techniquesare unique in the sense that they are not applied to traditional OFDMsignals, but to OFDM symbols embedded within ultrawideband UWBnoise. Another aspect of this technique is that does not use trainingsymbols, pilots, or repeated symbols for synchronization. Without anypreprocessing required in the transmitter, the correlation property ofbandlimited white noise is used to achieve the desired results. Theprominent advantage envisioned is the development of a more reliableand covert communication system, allowing effective datadissemination in our networkcentric applications.657831, Session 4Passive RF tags for radar channel communications usingfrequencynotched noise waveformsK. D. Kim, R. M. Narayanan, The Pennsylvania State Univ.In military operations, especially in the battlefield, information about thewarfighters situation and surroundings is very important in deciding thenext steps of tactical operations. However, owing to its unique situation,communications ability is very limited and is greatly compromised if thewarfighter transmits any kind of signal. Therefore, the passive RF tag,similar to those used in RFIDs, is an attractive solution to providelimited communications and signaling in a concealed manner. A newtechnique to induce covertness in the RF tag channel with noisewaveforms for radar communications is under investigation. Theproposed solution uses noise waveforms for covertness because theyhave low probabilityofdetection LPD and low probabilityofinterceptLPI properties. The radar system transmits bandlimited noise signalsand the RF tag on the warfighters vehicle retransmits a modified noiselike waveform back towards the radar using a prearranged circuitstructure. The noiselike waveform is a frequencynotched version ofthe received radar waveform. The probability density function PDF ofthe notched waveform is not very different from that of the original noisewaveform if the amount of notch is 10 of the entire band. The actuallocation of the notch frequency conveys a specific message. When theradar receives the signal from the tag, it correlates the received signalfrom tags with the expected signal response for specific messages andfinds the proper tag locations depending on the results. To providebattlefield situation information, warfighters modify the tags to inducethe frequency notches. For example, if they are in a dangerous situationthey may send TagA signal asking for reinforcement, and if they wantto convey that they are in a position to maintain their current operations,they may send TagB signal, etc. As a result, the distant radar canachieve situational awareness and do necessary actions.  Althoughsuch communications through radar channels is limited in scope, itachieves covertness while providing information about several criticalbattlefield situations.This work is supported by Air Force Office of Scientific ResearchAFOSR through Contract  FA95500610029.657832, Session 4A networkcentric robust resource allocation strategy forunmanned systems stability analysisK. Khorasani, Concordia Univ. CanadaIt is widely believed that communications will be the critical technicalfactor in designing large scale unmanned networks consisting of a largenumber of heterogeneous nodes that may be configured in adhocfashions and incorporating intricate architectures. In fact, one of thechallenges to this field is to recognize the entire network as aheterogenous collection of physical and information systems withcomplicated interconnections and interactions. Using high data ratesthat are essential for their realtime interactive command and controlsystems, these networks require the utilization of optimal integration oflocal feedback loops into a scheduling and resource allocation systems.This integration becomes particularly problematic in the presence oflatencies and delays.Given that dynamics of a network of unmanned systems could easilybecome unstable and unmanageable depending on theinterconnections between their nodes, in this paper we study howstability of the resulting timedelayed dependent controlled network canbe compromised based on configuration changes. We also formallyinvestigate and study the necessary conditions on our proposed robustresource allocation strategies to be able to cope with theseinterconnections and timedelays in an optimal fashion.Our timedelayed dependent network consists of three nodes that canbe configured into different architectures. To model our traffic andnetwork we use a fluid flow model that is of low order and simpler thana detailed Markovian queueing probabilistic models. Using the slidingmodebased variable structure control SMVSC techniques that enjoyrobustness capabilities, we design on the basis of an inaccurateuncertain model our proposed robust nonlinear feedbackbased controlapproaches. The results presented in this paper are analyzedanalytically to guarantee for different configurations the stability of ourknownunknown timedelayed dependent network of unmannedsystems.657833, Session 4Node compromise attacks and network connectivityK. S. Chan, F. Fekri, Georgia Institute of TechnologyNetcentric warfare requires widespread, highly reliablecommunications even in the face of adversarial influences. Maintainingconnectivity among network entities is vital towards mission readinessand execution. We examine required communications range of nodes ina wireless sensor network. Several parameters of these networks arestudied in terms of how they influence overall network connectivity suchas key predistribution schemes and node compromise attacks.Communications in wireless sensor networks is important due to thelimited resources available in these situations. In many battlespacesituations for networks of unmanned ground sensor nodes,communication range is limited by resources, hardware ability andunpredictable terrain. Additionally, networks attempt to minimize thetransmission power of each node to conserve power, as the radio isoftentimes the largest drain on available energy resources. Furthermore,such networks are vulnerable to physical node compromise and attackby an adversary and destroy connectivity in these situations. What isstudied here is overall network connectivity and its relationship to keypredistribution schemes and node compromise attacks. In networkingsituations with an adversarial presence, it may be possible to continueto mission objectives properly with the remaining uncompromisednetwork resources with some reconfiguring of network parameters.

Reimann, G. Vachtsevanos, Georgia Institute of Technology J.Ge, L. Tang, A. Liberson, Impact Technologies H. Chang, U.S. ArmyResearch OfficeIn future urban warfare scenarios, the expectations placed onunmanned vehicles in terms of autonomy, reliability and cooperation willbe significantly increased. This paper introduces an innovative solutionto the multiplayer differential pursuitevasion game problem, in whichmultiple pursuing unmanned vehicles attempt to intercept severalevading targets in minimum time. To reduce the complexity of themultiplayer game, it is decomposed into several simple twoplayergames. Each player is modeled using simple vehicle dynamics to limitthe complexity of the twoplayer games, and each game is solvedefficiently using the fast marching method. Based on the set of twoplayer game solutions, collaboration between the pursuers isreintroduced by assigning each pursuer the task of either containing orintercepting a target. In addition to reducing the overall complexity ofthe differential pursuitevasion game, the decomposition approach alsoallows for rapid online replanning thereby enabling the pursuers toadapt rapidly to possible changes in the game parameters. Severaldifferent multiplayer scenarios are simulated to illustrate theeffectiveness of the differential game approach.657837, Session 5Agentbased multiplatform control, collaboration, andtarget handoffN. P. Coleman, U.S. Army Armament Research, Development andEngineering Ctr. J. Robbins, B. Tirabassi, Technical Solutions, Inc.Deploying a world wide force that is strategically responsive anddominant at every point on the spectrum of conflict involves thecooperative system development and use of advanced technologiesthat yield revolutionary capabilities to support the warfighters needs.This presentation describes an agent based control architecture andprototype implementation developed by ARDEC that enables commandand control of multiple unmanned platforms and associated missionpackages for collaborative target handoffengagement. Currentprototypes provide the ability to remotely locate, track and predict themovement of enemy targets on the battlefield using a variety of sensorsystems hosted on multiple, nonhomogeneous SUAVs and UGVs.These technologies, including integrated mission packageplatformcontrol, agent collaboration, asset employment, target tracking, geolocation, target monitoring and prediction, path planning and targethandoff capabilities, have been developed and integrated as API basedcomponent plugins into the unique multimodal interface MultiPlatform Controller. These capabilities provide an enhanced SituationalAwareness, while greatly increasing the Soldiers lethality andsurvivability for improve mission success. Component technologieshave been developed by several different companies using the ARDECsponsored and developed Weapons System Operating EnvironmentWSOE Software Development Kit SDK for Decision Aids as asoftware service for easy inclusion by lead system integrators intofuture Army systems.Field tests have successfully demonstrated the MultiPlatformController deploying and commanding multiple ground and aerialrobotic platforms. Live video captured from Unmanned Aerial VehiclesUAVs is displayed on the MPC for target tracking and monitoringtasks. Applications developed using the SDK provide Gap Identification,Path Prediction and Planning, and Geolocation services on thetargeted tracks. The execution of plans on these tracks areaccomplished by converting them to Joint Architecture for UnmannedSystems JAUS and NATO 4586 command streams for execution byboth ground and air assets and sent to and from the Soldiers manwearable computer via tactical internet in Variable Message FormatVMF protocol as required to employ the asset.657838, Session 5Formation control in multiplayer pursuit evasion gamewith superior evadersX. Wang, The Ohio State Univ. G. Chen, Intelligent Automation Inc.J. B. Cruz, Jr., The Ohio State Univ. H. Chang, U.S. Army ResearchOffice E. Blasch, Air Force Research Lab.In this paper, we consider a multipursuer multievader pursuit evasiongame where some evaders maximal speeds are higher than those of allpursuers. We call such evaders as superior evaders to emphasize thefact that they have comparatively more advantageous controlresources. In multiplayer pursuit evasion game, hierarchical frameworkis applied widely in order to decompose the original complicated multiplayer game into multiple small scale games, i.e. onepursuer oneevader games and multipursuer singleevader games. The latter isespecially required for superior evaders. Although usually onlysuboptimal results are obtained, the resulting decentralized approachesare favored by researchers from the point view of communicationaspect for practical applications. For the autonomous systems ofpursuers in multipursuer singlesuperiorevader games, how to exploitthe cooperation between pursuers so that the superior evader can becaptured successfully in the shortest time is the main problem. Basedon our previous work, for a multipursuer singlesuperiorevader gameon a plane, we first study the number of pursuers necessary for thecapture. Regarding each player as a mass point, a moving planarcoordinate system is fixed on the evader. Then formation control is usedfor pursuers in their pursuit strategies so as to 1 avoid collisionbetween pursuers 2 reduce the distance between each pursuer andthe evader over the evolution of the game 3 keep the pursuersformation shape invariant relative to the evader during the pursuitprocess and enclose the superior evader within the union of eachpursuers capture domain at the end of the game.657839, Session 5Collaborative multitarget tracking using networkedrobotic vehiclesS.

Applications of such a framework would include multiagent intrusion detection, networkcentric asset coordination forintruder tracking, and other collaborative weapon engagementscenarios. The key idea of the developed framework is to designwireless vehicular network protocols that are customized forcollaborative multitarget tracking applications. The paper will compriseof the following components. First, the architectural details of a SwarmCapable Autonomous Vehicle SCAV system that is used as the mobileplatform in our target tracking application will be presented.

M. Moreland, U.S. Army Research, Development and EngineeringCommandSince the inception of powered flight, manned aerial vehicles have beena force multiplier on the battlefield. With the emergence of newtechnology, the structure of the military battlefield is changing. Onesuch technology, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles UAVs has emerged as avaluable asset for todays war fighter. UAVs have traditionally beenoperated by ground control stations, yet minimum research has beentargeted towards MAV  UAV connectivity. Airborne Manned UnmannedSystem Technology Baseline AMUSTBaseline was a concept thatdemonstrated the battlefield synergy gained by Manned and UnmannedVehicle teaming. AMUSTBaseline allowed an Apache Longbows AH64D copilot gunner CPG to have Level IV, control of a Hunter fixedwing UAV. Level IV control of a UAV includes flight control, payloadcontrol, and direct data receipt.  With the success of AMUSTBaseline,AATD, Lockheed Martin, and the Boeing Company are working towardsenhanced Manned and Unmanned connectivity, through a technologyinvestment agreement. This effort named Airborne Manned UnmannedSystem Technology Demonstration AMUSTD will focus on theconnectivity between two manned platforms, Apache Longbow AH64D and Command and Control C2 Blackhawk, and Hunter UAV. It willallow robust communication from the UAV to each platform throughTactical Common Data Link TCDL. AMUSTD will use decision aidingtechnology developed under the Rotorcraft Pilots Associate RPAAdvanced Technology Demonstration ATD to assist in control of theHunter UAV, as well as assist the pilot in regularly performed duties.Through the use of decision aiding and UAV control, the pilot andcommander will be better informed of potential threats, thus increasinghis situational awareness. The potential benefits of improved situationalawareness are increased pilot survivability, increased lethality, andincreased operational effectiveness and efficiency.Two products are being developed under the AMUSTD program, theWarfighters Associate WA which will be integrated onto the ApacheLongbow, and the Mobile Commanders Associate MCA which will beintegrated onto the A2C2S.  In this paper we will discuss what WA andMCA provides to the warfighter, and the results from the HSKT groundand flight test.657841, Session 7UrbanScapeB. S.

R. Hieb, M. J. Pullen, George Mason Univ. M. W. Powers, H. Yu,U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Ctr.Terrain and weather effects represent fundamental battlefieldinformation supporting situation awareness and the decisionmakingprocesses for netcentric operations. Realization of the promisedpotential of netcentric operations is challenging with respect to theseeffects, since these effects can both enhance or constrain force tacticsand behaviors, platform performance ground and air, systemperformance e.g. sensors and the soldier. We define four issues in thisarea as viewed from the perspective of the geospatial community. First,the size of geospatial data and information products enabling BattleCommand processes can be quite large requiring sensitivity to thefrequency of network use, the packet size of products and distributeddata and information provisioning.  Secondly, computationalrequirements for geoprocessing and analysis in the creation ofactionable geospatial information and the computational burden impactstrategies for netcentric geospatial solutions.  Third the tenants ofMetcalfs Law influence the design of information products for a netcentric Battle Command Environment.  Finally, interoperability betweenforce elements nodes must address not only syntactic consistency,but consistency of both a lexical and semantic representation if we areto realize shared, coherent awareness.  This paper presents a systemicapproach for successful resolution of these challenges.657844, Session 7Airborne data to actionable intelligence in minutesM. Phipps, P. P. Hed, M.

Enemy tactics now take conflicts into urban areas.Complex urban terrain, defined by its concentration of humanity withaccompanying buildings and infrastructure, diminishes thetechnological superiority of Command, Control, Communications,Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance C4ISRsystems.   Simultaneously, urban terrain is a force multiplier forinsurgents who exploit the cultural camouflage that provides themcover and concealment until the battlespace is shaped to theiradvantage.  The complexity and dynamic nature of this environmentgenerates unprecedented demands for preparedness and operationalagility at all echelons.Missions can transition between humanitarian assistance, stability andsupport, or armed combat instantaneously.  The demand for timely,accurate and precise Actionable Geospatial Intelligence is at apremium.  Yet the increase in both volume and frequency of suchintelligence in its raw forms could actually hamper decisionmakers asthey try to assimilate myriad information feeds.

Yuan, Univ. of OklahomaThis paper reviews key GIS approaches to geographic dynamicsunderstanding and event prediction, and the review will synthesizerecent developments and critical issues that hamper effectivespatiotemporal reasoning. Geographic domains exhibit diversedynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Such diverse andcomplex geographic dynamics challenges means to connect relevantinformation and infer the underlined processes. Central to the paper isthe idea that forms in space and time offer clues to the underlinedgeographic processes and events. Connections of forms and patternscaptured by spatiotemporal data to the responsible processes andevents serve as the conceptual and methodological foundations forgeographic dynamics understanding and event prediction.Reviews in the paper will investigate how geospatial forms and patternsmay suggest the underlined processes and events. Statistical methodshave long been established to examine if a point distribution should becategorized as random, clustered, or dispersed. When a pointdistribution is determined not random, the distribution is then assumedto be resulted from certain geographic events or processes. However,theoretical bases for random distributions of lines or polygons are notyet available, and statistical bases are lacking to evaluate linear orpolygonal patterns against random distributions. Nevertheless,alternative methods are being developed to connect geospatialdistributions of lines or polygons to geographic processes and events,especially in tracking, climate, and hydrology. The review, syntheses,and critics in the paper will draw new insights into theoretical andmethodological foundations for the study of geographic dynamicsunderstanding and event prediction.657848, Session 8Incorporating uncertainty with geospatial forecasts forterror eventsJ.

We discuss the variationcontributing factors, impacts theyhave on forecasts, and show the results from tests of a few of thefactors. Preliminary results when analyzing variation of the position ofreported historical event locations show numerical uncertainty withvalues ranging up to 100 m has a negligible effect on the forecastshowever, values exceeding 1 km may have significant impact bytranslocation of threat hotspots up to several blocks away.

Jacquez, BioMedware, Inc.and Univ. of MichiganMethods for analyzing geographic clusters of disease typically ignorethe spacetime variability inherent in epidemiologic datasets, do notadequately account for known risk factors e.g., smoking andeducation or covariates e.g., age, gender, and race, and do not permitinvestigation of the latency window between exposure and disease.Our research group recently developed Qstatistics for evaluatingspacetime clustering in cancer casecontrol studies with residentialhistories, computed using TerraSeers STISTM software.  This techniquerelies on timedependent nearest neighbor relationships to examineclustering at any moment in the lifecourse of the residential histories ofcases relative to that of controls.  In addition, in place of the widelyused null hypothesis of spatial randomness, each individualsprobability of being a case is instead based on hisher risk factors andcovariates.  Casecontrol clusters will be presented using residentialhistories of 220 bladder cancer cases and 440 controls in Michigan.  Inpreliminary analyses of this dataset, smoking, age, gender, race andeducation were sufficient to explain the majority of the clustering ofresidential histories of the cases.  Clusters of unexplained risk, however,were identified surrounding the business address histories of 10industries that emit known or suspected bladder cancer carcinogens.The clustering of 5 of these industries began in the 1970s and persistedthrough the 1990s.  This systematic approach for evaluating spacetime clustering has the potential to generate novel hypotheses aboutenvironmental risk factors.  These methods may be extended to detectdifferences in spacetime patterns of any two groups of people, makingthem valuable for security intelligence and surveillance operations.Conf. 6578 Defense Transformation and NetCentric Systems 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 357657852, Session 9GEOINT for MDAC.

Dufaux, M. Ouaret, T. Ebrahimi, cole Polytechnique Fdrale deLausanne SwitzerlandVideo surveillance systems are becoming omnipresent nowadays, dueto high criminality and terrorist threats. Large surveillance systems aredeployed in strategic places such as airports, public transportation anddowntown. Thanks to the improve performance and reducing cost ofcameras, a trend towards dense networks of cameras is expected. Thewireless camera sensor network is one example of such as system,which consists of a large number of nodes that are densely deployed,each node being an independent, lowpower, smart device withsensing, processing and wireless communication capabilities.Hereafter, we consider a network of multiple cameras which arecapturing overlapped images from the same scene with differentviewing positions, referred to as multiview. Because many visionbasedtechniques can benefit from multiview, such as object recognition,event detection, target tracking and view interpolation, multiview imageand video processing has attracted increasing attention recently. Therange of applications for multiview systems is very wide and coversdifferent areas such as homeland security and military, but alsoenvironment monitoring and healthcareOn the other hand, the amount of data captured in multiview imaging isoften tremendous. This makes data reduction a key issue. If thecameras were allowed to communicate with each other, it would beeasy to exploit this correlation in full and transmit only the necessaryinformation to the receiver. However, such collaboration is usually notfeasible since it would require a complex internode communicationsystem that would be power consuming. Furthermore, due to the strongcorrelation between images acquired by different cameras, multiviewdata reduction has its own characteristic that differs significantly fromtraditional imagevideo compression. It is therefore necessary todevelop compression algorithms that are able to exploit this correlationwithout requiring any cooperation amongst the cameras. As a result, anincreasing amount of work on multiview sampling and compressionhas been proposed in recent years.MPEG is conducting work in 3D AudioVideo 3DAV for MultiviewVideo Coding MVC. It is based on the recent Advanced Video CodingAVC standard. MVC performs blockbased predictive coding acrossthe cameras in addition to predictive coding along the time axis of eachcamera, hence achieving high compression efficiency. However, theencoder requires high computational power to perform predictivecoding. In addition, it calls for communication between the cameras,which is not feasible in practice.Distributed source coding DSC is a new coding paradigm based ontwo Information Theory theorems SlepianWolf and WynerZiv.Theoretically, it states that the optimal rate achieved when performingjoint encoding and decoding of two or more correlated sources can bereached by doing separate encoding and joint decoding. In otherwords, a single decoder is used to perform joint decoding exploiting thestatistical dependencies. Based on DSC, a new video coding paradigm,referred to as distributed video coding DVC is defined. In a practicalscenario such as a network of surveillance cameras, DVC allows for lowpower  low complexity cameras as well as no communication betweenthe cameras, which are major advantages.In multiview DVC, side information can be generated either bytemporal extrapolation within a camera sequence, or by interviewextrapolation from the side cameras. In this paper, we discuss somerecent advances in multiview DVC. In particular, we consider theproblem of view prediction across cameras and fusion strategy tooptimally combine temporal and interview side information. Results arepresented in terms of coding efficiency as well as complexity.657902, Session 1Memoryefficient contourbased regionofinterestcoding of arbitrarily large imagesN. G. Sadaka, Arizona State Univ. G. P. Abousleman, GeneralDynamics C4 Systems L. J. Karam, Arizona State Univ.In this paper, we present a memoryefficient, contourbased, regionofinterest ROI algorithm designed for ultralowbitrate compression ofvery large images. The proposed technique is integrated into a userinteractive waveletbased image coding system in which multiple ROIsof any shape and size can be selected and coded efficiently. The codingtechnique compresses regions of interest and background informationindependently by allocating more bits to selected targets and fewer bitsto the background data. This allows the user to transmit large images atvery low bandwidths with lossylossless ROI coding, while preservingthe background content to a certain level for contextual purposes.Extremely large images e.g., 65000 X 65000 pixels with multiple largeROIs can be coded with minimal memory usage by using intelligent ROItiling techniques. The foreground information at the encoderdecoder isindependently extracted for each tile without adding extra ROI sideinformation to the bit stream. The arbitrary ROI contour is downsampled and differential chain coded DCC for efficient transmission.ROI wavelet masks for each tile are generated and processedindependently to handle any size image and any shapesize ofoverlapping ROIs. The resulting system dramatically reduces the datastorage and transmission bandwidth requirements for large digitalimages with multiple ROIs.657903, Session 1Realtime superresolutionenhanced ultralowbitratevideo codingW. Chien, Arizona State Univ. G. P. Abousleman, General DynamicsC4 Systems L. J. Karam, Arizona State Univ.This paper presents a softwareonly, realtime video coderdecodercodec with superresolutionbased enhancement for ultralowbitratecompression.  The codec incorporates a modified JPEG2000 core andinterframe predictive coding, and can operate with network bandwidthsof less than 1 kbitssecond.   Highly compressed video exhibits severecoding artifacts that degrade visual quality.  To lower the level of noiseand retain the sharpness of the video frames, we build on our previouswork in superresolutionbased video enhancement and provide newextensions so that it can be employed in realtime video codingsystems.  The adopted superresolutionbased enhancement uses aconstrained set of motion vectors that is computed from the originaluncompressed video at the encoder.  Artificial motion is also added tothe difference frame to maximize the enhancement performance.  Theencoder can transmit either the full set of motion vectors or theconstrained set of motion vectors depending upon the availablebandwidth.  At the decoder, each pixel of the decoded frame isassigned to a motion vector from the constrained motion vector set.L2norm minimization superresolution is then applied to the decodedframe set previous frame, current frame, and next frame.  A selectivesuperresolution scheme is proposed in order to prevent ghostingwhich, otherwise, would result from the adopted superresolutionenhancement scheme when the motion estimation fails to findappropriate motion vectors.   Results using the proposed systemdemonstrate significant improvement in the visual quality of the codedvideo sequences. spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 359657904, Session 1Signal compression via coordinate logic transformsE. E. Danahy, K. A. Panetta, Tufts Univ. S. S. Agaian, The Univ. ofTexas at San AntonioWhile the number of mobile devices in use is steadily increasing, so isthe demand for more complex multimedia content.  With this comes anadditional need for advanced signal processing techniques to quickly,efficiently, and accurately manipulate the data.  One area where this ismost evident is in signal compression, where the necessity for reducingthe size of signals being streamed and presented is essential toadequate playback.  However, as the quality of the devices also riseslarger screens, higher resolution audio, faster playback, the quality ofthe stored or transmitted data cant suffer due to compression, as anyerrors and sacrifices become more apparent to the end user.Coordinate logic CL filters are a method for applying basic logicoperations to signals, and have been used in several image processingareas from edge detection to noise filtering.  Presented here is analternate method for calculating the CL filters through the use of logicaltransforms, eliminating the need for the logic operations.  Termedcoordinate logic CL transforms, they presents the possibility of asimpler hardware implementation, as algorithmic parallelism is presentthat can be exploited through application specific circuits.  This paperuses CL transforms to introduce a new method for signal compression,leading to a reduction in bandwidth and therefore the possibility ofhigher throughput during transmission.  Applicable to a wide range ofsignal types for all types of applications, compression via CL transformsis demonstrated on several binary and grayscale digital images.  Theresults, compared with JPEG a commonly used compressionalgorithm, show that this technique is able to achieve competitivelevels of compression coupled with a limited introduction of errors, bothdesired aspects for the use of multimedia in mobile devices.657905, Session 1A predictivetransform PT sidelobe canceller foradaptive radar systemsE.

Jassim, Univ. of Buckingham United KingdomMalicious nodes can seriously damage wireless ad hoc networks as aresult of different actions such as packet dropping, 1. Secure routes aredefined as the shortest path to the destinationhost while every node onthe route is trusted even if not known. In this paper we shall reviewexisting techniques for secure routing and propose to complement theroute finding with creditability scores. Each node saves a creditscore listfor its immediate neighbors. Each node monitors its neighbors and storesinformation about their behavior. Credits are reviewed and updatedregularly. The level of trust in any route will be based on the creditsassociated with the neighbors belonging to the discovered route.Malicious nodes will have significantly lower credit scores than othernodes, due to packet dropping behavior, and can be avoided whenlooking for the best route.We shall evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by modifyingour simulation system so that each node has a credit list of itsneighbors which are updated according to the neighbors behaviors.Secure routefinding algorithms will be based on the proposedmechanism. We shall conduct a series of simulations with and withoutthe proposed scheme and compare the results.1 Fanzhi Li, Xiyu Shi  Sabah Jassim, The Effects of Malicious Nodeson Performance of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks, Proceedings of SPIE 6250,May 2006657910, Session 2A sobering look at topology constraints in network sensorsystemsG.

C. Cherukuri, S. S. Agaian, The Univ. of Texas at San AntonioSteganography is an art of hiding the very presence of communicationby embedding message into harmless digital media.  Hence, it can betechnically referred as the means of secret communication.  Asteganographic should posses the following properties a good visual statistical imperceptibility for the security of hidden communication bsufficient payload for ensuring that a large quantity of data can beconveyed.  Joint Photographic Experts Group JPEG is lossycompression, which means that the reconstructed image is very nearlythe same as the original but not the exact duplicateIn this article, we present a new algorithm using the switching theory forhiding the secured information into a given JPEGcompressed images.In brief, the algorithm identifies the smooth, texture, edge block basedfor the relation between the between the DC coefficient and ACcoefficients.  This helps in analyzing the statistical nature of each blockthus minimizing the distortion and enhancing the security of theembedded information.  The embedding mechanism is switched basedon the blocks statistical characteristics.  Thus, the proposed systemoffers high capacity while simultaneously withstanding visual andstatistical attacks.The comparisons with the existing embedding algorithms such F5 andModel Steganographic algorithms are presented in terms of themaximum embeddable data and corresponding embedding efficiency.And robust of the proposed system in terms of  RMS error and securityissues with reference to existing stego detection algorithms will bepresented.657912, Session 3New quantization matricesbased JPEG steganographyY. O. Yildiz, K. A. Panetta, Tufts Univ. S. S. Agaian, The Univ. ofTexas at San AntonioModern steganography is a secure communication of information byembedding a secretmessage within a cover digital multimediawithout any perceptual distortion of the cover media, so the presence ofthe hidden message is indiscernible.  Modern steganography has drawnbroad interest in the past decade. The availability of varioussteganographic algorithms, together with existing digital multimedia andInternet, has made covertsecure communications a reality in this digitalage.  JPEG images are popular cover media due to their visualresilience to steganographic intrusion and JPEGs widespread use.Recently, several transform based steganographic methods for datahiding in JPEG have been developed JSteg 1993, With maximum capacity of 13 and with embeddingefficiency of 2, F5 A.Westfeld, 2001, With maximum capacity of 13 and withembedding efficiency of  1.5, Outguess  N.Provos, 2001 With maximum capacity of 6 and withembedding efficiency of 1.

Huang, W. Yen, Y. Chen, Tatung Univ. TaiwanOne of the great challenges of the existing watermarking methods istheir limited resistance to the extensive geometric attacks. Geometricattacks can be decomposed into two classes global distortion such asrotations and translations and local distortion such as the StirMarkattack. We have found that the weakness of multiple watermarkembedding methods that were initially designed to resist geometricattacks is the inability to withstand the combination of geometricattacks. In this paper, the watermark is used in the grayscaleauthentication image. We propose a robust image watermarkingscheme that can withstand the geometric attacks by using local trimesh feature points. Our proposed method can resynchronize theattacked images and is independent of the embedding andauthentication process. The geometric invariant scheme is combinedwith the complementary modulation embedding strategy to enhancethe resistance of geometric attacks. The experimental results verify thatthe proposed scheme is effective for geometric attacks.657915, Session 3Steganography anomaly detection using simple oneclass classificationB. M. Rodriguez II, G. L. Peterson, Air Force Institute of TechnologyS. S. Agaian, The Univ. of Texas at San AntonioThere are several security issues tied to multimedia when implementingthe various applications in the cellular phone and wireless industry.  Oneprimary concern is the potential ease of implementing a steganographysystem.  Traditionally, the only mechanism to embed information into amedia file has been with a desktop computer.  But, as the cellularphone and wireless industry matures, it becomes much simpler for thesame techniques to be performed using a cell phone.  In this paper twomethods are compared that classify cell phone images as either ananomaly or clean, where a clean image is one in which no alterationshave been made and an anomalous image is one in which informationhas been hidden within the image.  An image in which information hasbeen hidden is known as a stego image.  The main concern in detectingsteganographic content with machine learning using cell phone imagesor otherwise is that training targets specific embedding procedures todetermine if the method has been used to generate a stego image.  Thisleads to a possible flaw in the system when the learned model of stegois faced with a new stego method which doesnt match the existingmodel.  The proposed solution to this problem is to develop systemsthat detect steganography as anomalies, making the embeddingmethod irrelevant in detection.  The classification methods beingcompared are self organizing map SOM and Parzenwindows used foranomaly detection of steganographic content.Conf. 6579 Mobile MultimediaImage Processing For Military And SecurityApplications 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 361657916, Session 4Data hiding based on FibonacciHaar transformF. Battisti, Univ. degli Studi di Roma Tre Italy K. O. Egiazarian,Tampere Univ. of Technology Finland M. Carli, A. Neri, Univ. degliStudi di Roma Tre ItalyIn this work, we propose a wavelet domain watermarking system basedon the Fibonacci numbers. The generalized Fibonacci psequence isdefined by A.P. Stakhov. Fibonacci 1numbers are 1, 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21,..., that is the classical Fibonacci sequence. Using the Fibonacci psequence, it is possible to define a new transform domain, having astructure similar to the Haar wavelet decomposition with asymmetries inthe subbands. Eskicioglu proposed a robust watermarking methodbased on SVD. In this contribution, we present the results obtainedadopting that SVD method. The main feature of this algorithm is thepossibility to embed four different marks or four versions of the samemark at the same time. The strength of each mark is tuned to theparticular subband and to the lsequence. Without knowing the actualvalue of the l parameter, it is not possible to determine thedecomposition used, adding a further level of security to the system.For each l, a new decomposition is available we are investigating thepossibility to relate the values of l to the content of the image, tomaximize the embedding capacity of the system while preserving theinvisibility of the mark. The perceptual aspect of the proposedwatermarking scheme have been considered and measured byevaluating both the PSNR and the WPSNR.  To test the robustness ofthe embedding procedure, the watermarked image has been modifiedwith different attacks and mark has been extracted. The maincontributions of this approach are the use of  the FHT for hidingpurposes, the flexibility in data hiding capacity, lth  keydependentsecrecy of the used transform, and its robustness against the mostcommons attacks.657917, Session 4A chaotic cipher Mmohocc and its security analysisX.

The designs of its majorcomponents are discussed. The cryptographic properties of period,auto and crosscorrelations, and the mixture of Markov processes andspatiotemporal effects are investigated. The cipher is resistant to therelatedkeyIV attacks, TimeMemoryData tradeoff attacks, algebraicattacks, and chosentext attacks. The keystreams successfully passedtwo batteries of statistical tests and the encryption speed is comparablewith RC4 and CTRAES. We suggest that this cipher will be suitable forwireless and multimedia communication scenarios.657919, Session 4Reversible data hiding by exploiting structureinformation in block transform domainH. Cai, S. S. Agaian, The Univ. of Texas at San AntonioTraditional data hiding schemes tend to permanently distort the covermedia while the hidden information is extracted. Despite minor orinvisible in some circumstances, the distortion in the cover mediacannot be allowed in a variety of important applications, such asmilitary uses, medical diagnosis, law enforcement and remote sensing.Reversible or lossless data hiding methods have been developed toalleviate this problem by preserving the original information. The currentreversible data hiding algorithms are developed in the spatial domainand transform domain using wavelet and the DCT. The limits of thesemethods exist, for example, they cannot achieve low distortion for highcapacity embedding information. It is intriguing to develop newalgorithms which can combine the advantages of spatial and transformdomains.In this paper, we present a novel reversible data hiding technique whichutilizes the features of DCT and wavelet transforms to achieve lowdistortion and high capacity of information hiding. Our test dataachieved 00.5 bpp embedding size for the grayscale images of512x512x8 and the PSNR is higher than 50dB. In the presentedalgorithm, the wavelet multilevel structure and the corresponding DCTpositions are chosen as the coefficients to embed the hiddeninformation. This algorithm can be readily extended to JPEGJPEG2000format images. While the proposed reversible data hiding algorithm isapplied to the still images, it is straightforward to be implemented toMPEG images.657920, Session 5Biometric authentication system with watermarkingbased signatures protectionP. Campisi, E. Maiorana, A. Neri, Univ. degli Studi Roma Tre ItalyIn the last few years we have witnessed a constant increase of theutilization of biometricsbased authentication systems due to severalinherent advantages they offer over classic methods. However, in abiometric system the issue of data security and integrity is extremelycritical. Encryption and watermarking are among the possiblecountermeasures to attacks. While encryption does not provide securityanymore when the data are decrypted, watermarking can be used tosecure and authenticate unencrypted data. Watermarking basedsecuritization approaches involve embedding biometric information intothe host data, which can be even biometric data. Some approachesembedding fingerprints into host images, face features into fingerprints,iris features into faces, have already been proposed. We propose asignaturebased biometric system, using watermarking to keep secretsome signature features in a signature image. A signature is intrinsicallydifferent from other commonly used biometric data. Being a behaviouralbiometric, it possesses dynamic properties as well as statisticalcharacteristics, unlike fingerprints and faces, which can not be derivedfrom a still signature image. The proposed method aims at embeddingand keeping hidden the dynamic features and the overall statisticaldescription, belonging to the user or to a certification authority, in astatic representation of a signature, and using them for authentication.The used watermarking technique is tailored to images with sharpenededges, just like a signature picture, to obtain a robust method able tohide relevant data while keeping the original structure of the host figure,thus leading to low visibility of the embedded signal.657921, Session 5The problems of using ROC curve as the sole criteria inpositive biometrics identificationY.

ROC curve hasbeen served as a golden criteria in measuring the accuracy ofbiometrics system for positive biometrics identification. However, in thispaper, we will analyze the problems of using ROC curve as the solelycriteria in positive biometrics identification. Such as the sample size willdetermine the effectiveness of the ROC curve. From the view ofdetection and estimation theory, ROC curve only took concerns ofsystem variance, and would not be able to detect the system bias,which could result the big problem in accuracy. We will use irisrecognition as an example. At the end, we will discuss the solution tosolve these problems.657922, Session 5Waveletbased face detection for face recognitionN. AlJawad, S. A.

The Discrete Wavelet Transform DWT isa special case of the WT which provides a compact representation of asignal in the time and frequency domain. In particular, wavelettransforms are capable of representing smooth patterns as wellanomalies e.g. edges and sharp corners in images. In thispresentation, we are focusing using wavelet transforms for facial featuredetection.There are a number of different wavelet image decomposition schemes.The most commonly used scheme is the pyramid scheme, which wehave adopted.  At a resolution depth of k, the pyramidal schemedecomposes an image I into 3k1 frequency subbands LLk, HLk, LHk,HHk,..., HL1, LH1, HH1. the lowestpass subband LLk  representingthe k  level resolution approximation of the image I, while the other highfrequency subbands highlight the significant image features at differentscales. While the distribution of the LL coefficients is an approximationof that of the original image pixels, the coefficients in each of the othersubbands have a Laplacian also called generalised Gaussiandistribution. In this paper we shall propose a facial projection profile thatexploits the statistical properties and parameters of the nonLLsubbands to be used to locate and detect faces in imagesvideos. Weshall present test results to measure the performance of thesetechniques using benchmarked audiovisual imagesvideo.657923, Session 5Secure access control to hidden data by biometricfeaturesM. Cancellaro, M. Carli, Univ. degli Studi di Roma Tre Italy K. O.Egiazarian, Tampere Univ. of Technology Finland A. Neri, Univ.degli Studi di Roma Tre ItalyIn this paper a data hiding system, driven by biometric data, isproposed. Data hiding is a technique commonly used to protect thecopy right of digital information, by hiding some data the mark into theobject to be protected the cover data. To be effective, the embeddingprocedure should not be noticeable and should resist to the attacksaiming to remove the mark. One of the main vulnerabilities of theexisting embedding systems is the public knowledge of the embeddingdomain. Fridrich has proposed a keydependent basis function schemeto increase the overall security of the watermarking applications.Obviously, the secrecy of the key and the modality of its generation, arethe core points of this augmentedsecurity watermarking system.  Inthis work, we propose the use of biometric data to generate the secretkey. These values  determine the particular  basis functions that  will beused to decompose the image. In particular, the Tree Structured Haartransform,  based on non uniform  sampling of the time interval splitting,has been chosen as transform domain. Among all the biometrictechniques, for this experiment we have selected the  fingerprint.  Afingerprint is made of a series of ridges and furrows on the surface ofthe finger. The uniqueness of a fingerprint can be determined by thepattern of ridges and furrows as well as the minutiae points. Minutiaepoints are local ridge characteristics that occur at either a ridgebifurcation or a ridge ending. A subset of minutiae is used to generatethe key.657924, Session 5Logpolarbased framework for mobile vehicle trackingwith road followerP. Melnyk, R. A. Messner, Univ. of New HampshireA new computationally efficient framework for vehicle tracking on amobile platform is proposed. The principal component of the frameworkis the logpolar transformation applied to video frames captured from astandard camera. The logpolar transformation provides two majorbenefits to realtime vehicle tracking from a vehicle moving along asingle or multilane road. First, it significantly reduces the amount ofdata required to be processed since it collapses the original Cartesianvideo frames into logpolar images with much smaller dimensions.Second, the logpolar transformation is capable of mitigatingperspective distortion due to its scale invariance property.  This secondaspect is of interest for vehicle tracking because the target vehicleappearance is preserved for all distances from the observer camera.This works however only if the center of logpolar transformation iscoincident with the vanishing point of perspective view. Therefore, aroad following algorithm is proposed to keep the center of logpolartransform on the vanishing point at every video frame compensating forthe carrying vehicle movements. Since the algorithm is intended to beused in the mobile embedded devices, it is developed to achieve bothmathematical simplicity and algorithmic efficiency while avoidingcomputationally expensive mathematical functions. The use oftrigonometric and exponential functions is minimized comparing to thelogHough transform traditionally used in logpolar space.  This newalgorithm focuses on straight radial line fragments, thus shifting itsmathematical engine to the linear equations domain.657925, Session 6Human visualsystembased image enhancementE. J. Wharton, K. A. Panetta, Tufts Univ. S. S. Agaian, The Univ. ofTexas at San AntonioMany current techniques for image enhancement perform poorly whenthe image contains regions of improper illumination or are overunderexposed.This paper presents a method of image enhancement using an adaptivethresholding method based on the human visual system.  We utilize anumber of different enhancement algorithms applied selectively to thedifferent regions of an image to achieve a better overall enhancementthan applying a single technique globally.  The presented method isuseful for images that contain various regions of improper illumination.It is also practical for correcting shadows.  This thresholding systemallows various enhancement algorithms to be used on different sectionsof the image based on the local visual characteristics.  It further allowsthe parameters to be tuned differently for the specific regions, giving amore visually pleasing output image.We demonstrate the algorithm and present results for several highquality images as well as lower quality images such as those capturedusing a cell phone camera.  We then compare and contrast our methodto other stateoftheart enhancement algorithms.657926, Session 6Wavelet library for constrained devicesJ. H. Ehlers, S. A. Jassim, Univ. of Buckingham United KingdomWavelet transforms are becoming an essential tool of imagevideoprocessing and analysis. This paper is concerned with core waveletbase image processinganalysis tasks that are suitable forimplementation on constrained devices and or demanding conditions,such as mobile phones or other similar devices. These devices have inmost cases limited memory and no support for floatingpointcalculations plus the fact that they should provide a realtime response.Different applications benefit more from different wavelet transforms,different decomposition schemes, even different subbands. Yet thedemands are the same in terms of speed and efficiency.  Taking intoaccount the different combinations of several computing environmentsand context demands we designed and developed a wavelet librarycalled Heat Wave which is based on using the lifting scheme to createinteger wavelet coefficients within fixed bit length range.We will focus on two different requirement conditions and test theperformance of the Heat Wave library. The first condition was where afast biometric verification model was required and the second conditionrelates to video compression where memory is severely limited. Furthermore each condition we shall present test results for the performance ofthe various wavelets in the Heat Wave library in terms of speed ofprocessing and efficiency ratios.  In the case biometrics, efficiencyratios are based on verification accuracy and compression rates.Conf. 6579 Mobile MultimediaImage Processing For Military And SecurityApplications 2007 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdss 363657927, Session 6Efficient ROI recognitionbased CBIR for large databasewith parallel distributed RSOMS. Xia, X. Lv, J. Liu, W. Hu, National Univ. of Defense TechnologyChinaWe humans describe an image by extracting subjective concepts likesky, clouds, fowers, cars, etc. This however cannot be done by acontemporary CBIR system, where instead the image is interpreted inthe form of primitive features. These low level features are computedfrom pixels or patches. There is a gap between these lowlevelrepresentations and the highlevel concepts, popularly known as thesemantic gap. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a novel regionbased indexing and retrieval scheme.First thousands of images are segmented into a galaxy of meaningfulROIs, called imageprimitive. Thereafter, all imageprimitives arestandardized as imagekeywords. Each image primitive, with its lowlevel feature vector being extracted, is combined with one or morebasic semantic concepts. Then a Rescursive SOMRSOM tree , aspecial kind of hierarchical cluster tree and composed of multiSOMnets, can be supervisingly trained. In such an RSOM tree, the featurevector of each imageprimitive is recognized as one or more results,namely the semantic concepts, meanwhile they are separatelyassociated with one or multi image documents. Finally, because anRSOM tree incorporates the cluster representation into the indexstructure, it provides a practical solution to index clustered data setsand supports the retrieval of nearestneighbors effectively and efficientlywithout having to linearly search a highdimensional large database ofROIfeatures. Consequently, all images are converted to textdocuments containing multikeywords, so they are further indexed andretrieved using modifed elastic bucket tries.As a complementarity, considering the properties of a large anddynamic database, and the structure characteristics of the RSOM tree,an incremental RSOM treebased distributed parallel clustering andrecognizing algorithm was advanced.The performance of the proposed scheme has been tested on largeimage database.657928, Session 6Interactive and adaptive image segmentation algorithmfor CBIRX. Lv, S. Xia, National Univ. of Defense Technology ChinaImage segmentation is critical for contentbased image retrievalCBIR.When an image is automatically segmented with traditional regiongrowing method, a satisfactory performance is usually not guaranteed.Since humans are the ultimate users of most CBIR systems, it isimportant to obtain segmentations that can be used to organize imagecontents semantically, according to categories that are meaningful tohumans. As a state of the art, it is very difficult to reach this goalautomatically. Since we humans can quickly capture the information ofan image, this can be a kind of very reliable prior information. Byutilizing this in a humanmachine interactive way, a new approach thatis based on lowlevel features for color and texture, is proposed. Itcombines knowledge of human perception in order to segment naturalscenes into perceptuallysemantically uniform regions.The proposed approach is based on two types of spatially adaptivelowlevel features. The first describes the local color composition interms of spatially adaptive dominant colors, and the second describesthe spatial characteristics of the grayscale component of the texture. Inthe procedure of segmentation, the morphological operator dilation isused to fill inner small holes in segmented object regions andmorphological erosion to remove some wrong or unuseful edges, theimage enhancing technique is also used to enhance the homogeneity ofa single object region and the gap between two adjacent object regionsin visual feature. Together with as less human operations as possible,the proposed algorithm used to obtain robust, accurate segmentations.The resulting segmentations convey semantic information that can beused for CBIR. The performance of the proposed algorithms isdemonstrated in the domain of photographic images.657913, Poster SessionFourier phase domain steganography phase binencoding via interpolationE. L. Rivas, S. S. Agaian, The Univ. of Texas at San AntonioThe art of writing in cipher, or steganography, has been used forcenturies in various media including in written form and, more recently,in audio and image electrical signals. Most of the existing modernsteganographic methods can be classified into two major classes, timedomain and transform domain techniques.  Any steganographictechnique must achieve a balance between the following three primaryconstraints1 Perceptibility of the secret message within the carrier2 Robustness to host perturbation or distortion3 Message bandwidth or densityOne of the most broadly covered techniques is that of the LeastSignificant Bit, or bitplane, encoding. While this technique allows ahigh message bandwidth and randomizes the signal to appear as noise,thereby decreasing perceptibility, it can also be very sensitive toattacks.In this paper, we present a new steganographic technique for hidingsecured data into the phase coefficients in the transform domain.  Inbrief, the cover is converted to the Fourier domain and the target phasebin is replaced by a value which itself is the linear interpolation of thetwo neighboring bins. Then a phase shift is added to or subtracted fromthe interpolated value. The motivation of this process is to minimize theerror induced by bin manipulation while maintaining a system that isrobust to distortion due to audio compression and noise. Comparisonof error rates due to noise and audio compression is made with asimilar technique, relative phase encoding.657930, Poster SessionA robust digital watermarking scheme by use of integralimaging techniqueD.

WhileImpulse Radio UWB IRUWB is obtained by the transmission of ultrashort impulses, Multi Band UWB MBUWB is based on OrthogonalFrequency Division Multiplexing OFDM technology.In this paper we propose an OFDM UWB system with a physical layerbuiltin security management algorithm. In brief, M of the N used OFDMfrequencies, are used to transmit the data, while the remaining NMsubbands carry the data encryptedhash version. An LPSK PhaseShift Keyng modulation is adopted on each career.The mth  dataconstellation, 1mM, changes its starting phase phimevery symbol time T while all the encryptedhash constellations haveConf. 6579 Mobile MultimediaImage Processing For Military And SecurityApplications 2007364 spiespie.org  Tel 1 360 676 3290  spie.orgeventsdssthetam0 M1mN. The phasehopping sequence phi1, phi2, ...,phim for the kth symbol period, is decided by the encryptedhash bittransmitted during the k1th time T. Thus the data during the firstperiod T must be transmitted without any hoppingsequence.The encryptedhash MD2 128 bit Message Digest algorithm works likea FEC Forward Error Correction, and at the same time provides arobust data protection. Moreover, since the constellation keys changevery rapidly, they are also difficultly detectable by a hypothetic attacker.Simulations results verify the superior performance of the proposedapproach, also in terms of BER, due to the encrypted hash, withrespect to a standard PSKOFDM system.657932, Poster SessionQuantify similarity with measurement of enhancement byentropyE. A. Silva, K. A. Panetta, Tufts Univ. S. S. Agaian, The Univ. ofTexas at San AntonioIn this paper we show that a modified version of the measurement ofenhancement by entropy EME can be used as an image similaritymeasure, and thus an image quality measure.  Until now, EME hasgenerally been used to measure the level of enhancement obtainedusing a given enhancement algorithm and enhancement parameter.The similarityEME SEME is based on the EME for enhancement.Image similarity assessment is closely related to image qualityassessment in that quality is based on the apparent differencesbetween the degraded image in question and the original, unmodifiedimage.  Automated evaluation of image compression systems relies onaccurate quality measurement.  The importance of high qualitycompression systems increases as the applications for such systemsincrease, e.g. in medical imaging.  Current algorithms for measuringsimilarity include mean squared error MSE, peak signaltonoise ratioPSNR, and structural similarity SSIM.  We will compare SEME toexisting measures over a set of images judged by humans.657933, Poster SessionThe evolution of ambient learning and ambient learningin a mobile worldR. Creutzburg, Fachhochschule Brandenburg GermanyDuring the last years a lot of new technologies for distance and elearning have been developed. Several new terms and notions havebeen created dlearning, elearning, mlearning, ubiquitous learning,ambient learning, .... The aim of this paper is to give an overview ofthese developments and analyse the terms carefully. Furthermore, anoverview of the new developments and the new paradigms in elearningthat result in future ambient learning in a mobile world is given.Conf. 6579 Mobile MultimediaImage Processing For Military And SecurityApplications 2007
