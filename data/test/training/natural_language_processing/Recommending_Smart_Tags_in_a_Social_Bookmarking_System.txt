Abstract. Collaborative tagging systems are harnessing the power of online
communities, making the task of knowledge contribution more attractive to a
broader audience of Web users. In particular, social bookmarking systems have
shifted the organization of bookmarks from an individual activity performed on
a personal desktop to a collective endeavor over the Web. In such a context,
suggestive tagging has proved to be helpful in consolidating the usage of tags,
leading to a quick convergence to a folksonomy.
In a social bookmarking system, users' annotations can be regarded as a reliable
indicator of interests and preferences. A recommender system is able to learn
user interests and preferences during the interaction in order to construct a user
profile.
In this paper, we propose a smart tag recommender able to learn from past user
interaction as well as the content of the resources to annotate. The aim of the
system is to support users of current social bookmarking systems by providing a
list of new meaningful tags. The proposed system is based on ITem
Recommender, a content-based recommender previously used in a Digital
Library scenario.

1   Introduction
Since Tim Berners-Lee's inceptive Semantic Web vision [2], online communities
have taken an active role in the task of knowledge contribution on the Web. Users are
no longer passive information consumers, but active participants working in close
collaboration to create new content and share it, using the Web as the underlying
platform. The phenomenon of Web 2.01 has led to the development of several tools
which have succeeded in making this task more attractive to a broader audience.

Powerful tools for lightweight metadata creation, such as collaborative tagging
systems, harness the power of virtual communities and have been shown effective in
gathering quickly large amounts of information directly generated by users.
Collaborative tagging systems, also known as folksonomies [8], allow people to
organize a set of resources, annotating them with tags via a web-based interface.
Unlike top-down centralized approaches, folksonomies have revealed a noteworthy
ability in adhering to the personal way of thinking [7]. The opportunity of using free
tags with no restrictions allows users to express their own perspective on the
annotated resource. Therefore, these annotations can become a reliable indicator of
interests and preferences of active participants in such systems.
On the other hand, recommender systems [5] are able to learn user interests during
the interaction in order to construct (and update) a user profile that can be later
exploited for information filtering. A recommender system can be improved by the
sheer size of the content available on the Web and the diverse expectations of its user
base. Web applications need to combine all available knowledge in order to provide
personalized and user-friendly services. Over the years, personalized Web
applications and services have been developed, which exploit Web Mining
technologies to discover shallow patterns hidden within masses of transactional,
navigational, and content-structural data. In addition, knowledge-based recommender
systems are able to exploit domain knowledge by integrating domain ontologies.
We think that combining the strengths of Web Mining with the benefit of deeper
semantic and the attractiveness of collaborative tagging systems can be a first step to
bridge the gap between Semantic Web and Web 2.0.
In this paper we propose an approach to improve an existing recommender system
with the purpose of exploiting the information about users’ interests provided in form
of tags by del.icio.us2, the most popular social bookmarking system. Our aim is to
support users of current collaborative tagging systems by providing tag
recommendations based on both the annotations already performed and the content to
annotate. The contribution is twofold: A semantic suggesting feature in a social
bookmarking system can foster the tag convergence, useful for example to limit the
synonymy issue; furthermore, suggesting meaningful tags to a user according to the
interests stored in her profile can significantly improve the user experience,
augmenting the number of active participants in the collaborative system.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents background
information about tag recommendation in social bookmarking systems. An illustrative
user scenario motivating our approach is provided in Section 3, while Section 4
describes how we plan to extend our recommender system. Finally, Section 5 draws
conclusions and points out some challenges we are going to address in the near future.
2   Related Work
Previous studies on bookmarks use showed that main motivations for creating
bookmarks are based on personal interests and quality of the content, high frequency

of current use, as well as a sense of potential reuse [1]. The most familiar approach to
store markers for re-finding information on the Web has been through the use of
personal bookmarks, supported by almost all browsers. In the last few years, social
bookmarking systems have shifted the organization of bookmarks from an individual
activity performed on a personal desktop to a collective endeavor over the Web.
Although bookmark collections are personal, the opportunity of accessing to such
personal collections from any Web-connected machine (together with the use of free
multiple tags, helpful in overcoming the limitation of the traditional hierarchically
organized folders) have led to a wide spread of these social systems. Even though
contributions are motivated by the private need to easily organize personal items, they
also aggregate at a higher level via a collaborative tagging endeavor, that allows the
shaping of social networks [13]. Furthermore, some tagging support features, such as
suggestive tagging [11], have proved to be helpful in improving the user experience
as well as fostering an emerging consensus on the meaning of the terms rising up in
the folksonomy [6].
Among the different social bookmarking systems, del.icio.us, one of the earliest
and most popular ones, is the only application that illustrates some remarkable
suggestive tagging features. When a user saves a bookmark in del.icio.us, she can
manually enter as many tags as she would like, but she can also be supported by a list
of suggested tags (Figure 1). Popular tags are what other people have tagged this page
as, and recommended tags are a combination of tags user has already used and tags
that other people have used.


Figure 1. Saving a bookmark in del.icio.us

Rather than recommendations based on some underlying analysis, this kind of
suggestions can be regarded as a selection of tags in the sense that the system has to
choose a small number of tags to display among the sheer size of terms already
associated to an item. According to the tag selection approach, Sen et al. [16]

investigate how different algorithms for selecting tags to display, influence users’
personal vocabularies while annotating movies in a movie recommendation system.
On the other hand, as an evidence of the lack of social bookmarking systems that
exploit actual tag recommendations (as far as we know), there is few work on such a
topic published via the scholarly literature.
Xu et al. [17] define a set of general criteria for a good tagging system to identify
the most appropriate tags, while eliminating noise and spam. These criteria, identified
through a study of tag usage by real users in My Web 2.0, cover desirable properties
of a good tagging system, including high coverage of multiple facets to ensure good
recall, least effort to reduce the cost involved in browsing, and high popularity to
ensure tag quality. The authors then propose a collaborative tag suggestion algorithm
that adopts those criteria to recommend appropriate tags.
Hotho et al. [9] propose an adaptation of both a data mining and information
retrieval approach to detect emergent semantics within a collaborative tagging system.
The first adaptation lies in reducing the three-dimensional folksonomy to a two
dimensional formal context in order to apply association rule mining techniques.
Discovered association rules can be then exploited in a recommender system which
supports the user in choosing useful tags. The latter is an adaptation of the PageRank
algorithm [3] to the tripartite hypergraph structure of a folksonomy. The algorithm,
named FolkRank, incorporates the idea that a node is important if there are many
edges from other nodes pointing to it and if those nodes are important themselves, and
applies the same principle to the tripartite graph of the folksonomy. The FolkRank
algorithm is then used to rank users, tags, resources by their importance. Authors
suggest that such rankings can be exploited to generate recommendations for each
user about new potential resources of interest, related tags and other users possibly
interested on analogous topics.
3   Motivating Scenario
We consider del.icio.us as reference system because of the huge number of registered
users and the richness of suggestive tagging. In our scenario, John is a novice user,
who has just registered into the system and has no stored bookmarks yet. When John
is going to save his first bookmark, the current system suggests popular tags, i.e.,
terms heavily used by other users to annotate the same resource. A recommender
system cannot suggest anything, until the user provides enough information to
generate a profile delineating personal interests. However, the use of del.icio.us as an
underlying platform makes it possible to support John with popular suggested tags,
until the recommender becomes able to actually learn John’s interests on the strength
of his personal bookmarks and tags.
After John has been using del.icio.us for a while, he has progressively built a large
bookmark collection, as well as a rich vocabulary of personal tags that can be
exploited by the Smart Tag Recommender system.
When John wishes to save a new bookmark in his personal space, he has a chance
to reuse some tags previously used, but he might also enter new tags according to the
subject of the resource he is going to annotate. This time the Smart Tag

Recommender can analyze the content of the resource selected by John in order to
obtain a collection of concepts describing the bookmark. The output of the content
analysis can be then used to retrieve similar bookmarks already annotated by John and
find out which tags John has previously used to store such references.
According to the concepts extracted by the analyzer and the tags associated to
existing similar bookmarks in John’s user profile, the Smart Tag Recommender can
now suggest meaningful tags for the resource John wishes to store. The Smart Tag
Recommender is not intended to replace the existing del.icio.us recommender, since it
provides a new layer of recommendation based on personal profiles and not on
popularity.
4   Recommender Architecture
The proposed scenario can be supported by a service that relies on a content-based
recommender system, such as ITem Recommender (ITR) [10]. Indeed, this system is
able to induce a profile of the user by learning from the content of documents she
annotated with a feedback according to her preferences. The induced user profile is a
structured representation of user interests which is then exploited to decide whether a
new document fits in with the user's preferences. In our case, we consider the problem
of learning user profiles as a binary text categorization task [14]: Each document has
to be classified as interesting or not with respect to the user preferences. Therefore,
the set of categories is C = {c+, c-}, where c+ is the positive class (user-likes) and c-
the negative one (user-dislikes). ITR uses a Naïve Bayes method to text
categorization; in this way the learned probabilistic model is used to classify a
document di by selecting the class with the highest probability. As a working model
for the Naïve Bayes classifier, we use the multinomial event model [12] to estimate
the a posteriori probability, P(cj|di) of document di belonging to class cj.
In order to capture the semantics of the user interests, learning is performed on
documents that have been previously analyzed by advanced Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (implemented in the Content Analyzer module in Figure
2) able to discover relevant concepts representing the content of the documents. The
key step in this process is Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), which is the task of
assigning a word with the most appropriate meaning, by taking into account the
context (a set of words that precede and follow the word to be disambiguated) in
which the word appears.  To sum up, documents are represented by concepts instead
of keywords, as in the classical vector space model [4]. In order to recognize correctly
the meaning of the words, the WSD procedure relies on the WordNet lexical database,
in which the set of all possible meanings for each word is maintained. Moreover, the
WSD procedure will be integrated with an Entity Recognizer module in order to
identify Named Entities that do not occur in WordNet. More details on the ITR
system and the WSD procedure are reported in [15].
The ITR system can be easily adapted to the scenario of del.icio.us tags
recommending. Indeed, ITR can be used to build a user profile able to support the
user in the task of annotating resources by suggesting tags on the basis of previously
tagged documents. Given T = {t1, t2, …, tn}, the set of all tags employed by the user in

her "tagging history", the idea is to include a set of n binary classifiers, each classifier
ck corresponding to tag tk, in the user profile. Any new document d is then matched
against the user profile so that each classifier ck in the profile can predict whether d
should be annotated with tk. The final outcome of the matching process is the set  of
tags recommended by the classifiers in the user profile.
The set of documents used to train ITR is the set of all the documents previously
annotated by the user. Each training document tagged with tk is considered as a
positive example for ck, while the set of negative examples for ck is represented by all
documents that have not been tagged with tk.
Figure 2 shows the conceptual architecture of the Smart Tag Recommender
system. Full rows indicate the learning step, while dotted rows indicate the
classification step.:
a) Learning step: An annotated documents is processed by the Content Analyzer in
order to obtain the Bag-Of-Synsets (BOS) model of the document. To this
purpose, NLP techniques, including WSD, are exploited. After that, for each tag
tk the Profile Extractor builds the corresponding classifier ck, that will be part of
the User Profile.
b) Classification step: A new document (New Doc) is processed by the Content
Analyzer, then the Recommender uses User Profile to select the most
appropriated tags for the document. Specifically, for each tag tk New Doc is
classified using the corresponding classifiers ck. The output of this process is the
list of recommended tags.

5   Conclusions and Future Work
Web 2.0 applications provide chance to semantically exploit the sheer size of user
generated content. Tags in a social bookmarking system can reveal users’ interests
and preferences. However, current systems suggest a lot of irrelevant tags, either on
the basis of personal recent use or because of their popularity among the community.
Our aim is to combine the strengths of Semantic Web and Web 2.0 in order to provide
better personalized tag recommendations.
In this paper, we have described a strategy to design an intelligent recommender
system which is able to learn from both past user interaction and the content of the
resources to annotate. The system is based on an existing content-based
recommender, that has been previously used in a Digital Library scenario. The main
idea is presented in the context of del.icio.us, the most popular social bookmarking
system. As future work, we plan to complete the development of the new
recommender system and perform an experimental evaluation within del.icio.us,
having the basic suggested tagging feature as a control group.
