We work on automatic document clustering and topic extraction, document categorization and document segmentation, with a focus on scalability and multi-modality. Multi-linguality : We have considerable expertise in machine translation, and its deployment in business processes, including domain adaptation and quality estimation of translation. More broadly, our information access tools can be extended to work multi and cross-lingual, by mapping several languages into a common space. We also develop computer-aided authoring tools to compose documents in a language you don't speak.
