Become a Programmer, Motherfucker Manifesto Become a Programmer, Motherfucker Buy a T-Shirt, Asshole! Become a Programmer, Motherfucker If you don't know how to code, then you can learn even if you think you can't. Thousands of people have learned programming from these fine books: Learn Python The Hard Way Learn Ruby The Hard Way Learn Code The Hard Way I'm also working on a whole series of programming education books at learncodethehardway.org . These are works in progress, and feedback is welcome.
