Coreference resolution is a foundational yet challenging natural language processing task which, if performed successfully, is likely to enhance such systems significantly. In this paper, we propose a semantically oriented, rule-based method to resolve sortal anaphora, a specific type of coreference that forms the majority of coreference instances in biomedical literature. The method addresses all entity types and relies on linguistic components of SemRep, a broad-coverage biomedical relation extraction system. It has been incorporated into SemRep, extending its core semantic interpretation capability from sentence level to discourse level. Results We evaluated our sortal anaphora resolution method in several ways. The first evaluation specifically focused on sortal anaphora relations. Our methodology achieved a F 1 score of 59.6 on the test portion of a manually annotated corpus of 320 Medline abstracts, a 4-fold improvement over the baseline method. Investigating the impact of sortal anaphora resolution on relation extraction, we found that the overall effect was positive, with 50 % of the changes involving uninformative relations being replaced by more specific and informative ones, while 35 % of the changes had no effect, and only 15 % were negative. We estimate that anaphora resolution results in changes in about 1.5 % of approximately 82 million semantic relations extracted from the entire PubMed. Conclusions Our results demonstrate that a heavily semantic approach to sortal anaphora resolution is largely effective for biomedical literature. Our evaluation and error analysis highlight some areas for further improvements, such as coordination processing and intra-sentential antecedent selection. Keywords Natural language processing Sortal anaphora resolution Biomedical literature Semantic relation extraction Background Coreference can be defined as the relation between textual mentions that refer to the same real-world entity [ 1 ]. Coreference resolution is the natural language processing (NLP) task that is concerned with identifying such mentions and linking them to form coreference chains (clusters). While a key task in natural language understanding, coreference resolution remains far from being solved. Without reliable coreference resolution, NLP systems focusing on advanced semantic tasks such as relation extraction, automatic summarization, and question answering are likely to suffer. Consider the fragments of a MEDLINE abstract (PMID 21349396) in Example (1). The first two sentences begin the abstract and the third sentence concludes it. (1) Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare and progressive disease of the pulmonary arterial circulation …. There are currently 3 classes of drugs approved for the treatment of PAH: prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors . … Although definitive evidence will require randomized and properly controlled long-term trials, the current evidence supports the long-term use of these drugs for the treatment of patients with PAH.   The underlined mentions form a coreference cluster: {3 classes of drugs approved for the treatment of PAH, {prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors}, these drugs} . Pairwise relation representation (such as {{prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors}, these drugs} ) can also be used to represent coreference. In the absence of coreference resolution, a relation extraction system could extract the following, not very informative, relation from the concluding sentence in Example (1) above: Drugs-TREATS-PAH On the other hand, with successful coreference resolution, the system would be able to extract the following relations, which are more specific and informative. Prostacyclin analogues-TREATS-PAH Endothelin receptor antagonists-TREATS-PAH Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors-TREATS-PAH In doing so, the system would also be able to move beyond sentence level processing to discourse level processing, bringing us closer to discourse understanding, the ultimate goal in NLP. Several types of coreference are often distinguished. For example, anaphora is a coreference relation in which a coreferential mention ( anaphor ), such as these drugs above, refers to a previously mentioned entity ( antecedent ) in text. Cataphora refers to a relation in which the coreferential expression ( cataphor ) refers to an entity subsequent to the expression in text ( consequent ). Broader views of coreference also consider relation types such as bridging and appositive . Different types of coreference can be indicated with mentions of varying types. For example, a major type of anaphora ( pronominal anaphora ) is indicated by pronouns, such as it, their, itself . In Example (1), the anaphor these drugs is a demonstrative noun phrase, therefore the anaphora relation can be referred to as nominal anaphora . Nominal anaphora is sometimes also referred to as sortal anaphora since such anaphors carry semantic type (sort) information, in contrast to pronominal expressions. For instance, in Example (1), the antecedents of these drugs can only be drug or drug class instances. In the studies focusing on coreference resolution in biomedical literature, sortal anaphors have attracted most attention, since they occur more frequently than other types. Castaño and Pustejovsky [ 2 ] found that approximately 60 % of anaphora instances in their corpus of MEDLINE abstracts were sortal. This was confirmed by Gasperin and Briscoe [ 3 ], who found that the majority of anaphora instances involved definite and demonstrative noun phrases in their corpus of full-text articles about Drosophila melanogaster . SemRep semantic interpreter SemRep [ 4 ] is a natural language processing tool that extracts semantic relations, also referred to as predications, from biomedical literature. Each predication is a logical subject-predicate-logical object triple, whose elements are drawn from the UMLS knowledge sources [ 5 ]; the subject and object are concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus and the predicate is a relation type from an expanded version of the UMLS Semantic Network. SemRep extracts a wide range of predicates regarding clinical medicine (e.g., TREATS, DIAGNOSES, ADMINISTERED_TO), substance interactions (e.g., STIMULATES, INHIBITS), genetic basis of disease (e.g., CAUSES, PREDISPOSES), and pharmacogenomics (e.g., AUGMENTS, DISRUPTS). From the input sentence in Example (2a), SemRep generates the three predications in Example (2b). Mentions corresponding to the predication arguments are underlined and those corresponding to the predicates are in bold. (2) The antiviral agent amantadine has been used to manage Parkinson’s disease or levodopa-induced dyskinesias for nearly 5 decades. Amantadine-ISA-Antiviral Agents Amantadine-TREATS-Parkinson Disease Amantadine-TREATS-Levodopa-induced dyskinesias   SemRep processing relies on the UMLS SPECIALIST Lexicon [ 6 ], MedPost part-of-speech tagger [ 7 ], and underspecified syntactic analysis, and it is supported by MetaMap [ 8 ] for normalizing noun phrases to UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. Entrez Gene [ 9 ] serves as a supplementary source to the UMLS Metathesaurus with respect to gene/protein terms. Indicator rules are used to map lexical and syntactic phenomena to predicates. Indicators include lexical categories, such as verbs, nominalizations, and prepositions, and syntactic constructions, such as appositives or modifier-head structure in the simple noun phrase. For instance, in Example (2), the ISA predicate is indicated by the fact that its arguments are in a restrictive appositive construction ([ antiviral agent ][ amantadine ]), while TREATS is lexically indicated by the verb manage . Using an ontology engineering approach [ 10 ], SemRep has been extended to domains that are outside the scope of the UMLS, such as disaster information management and public health. It has also been the basis for the Semantic MEDLINE web application [ 11 ] and SemMedDB, a PubMed-scale repository of semantic predications [ 12 ]. Overview In the current study, our goal has been to extend semantic interpretation capabilities of SemRep through anaphora resolution. Based on the observed prominence of sortal anaphora in biomedical literature [ 2 , 3 ], we focused specifically on sortal anaphora resolution. Our rule-based methodology has a linguistic orientation and makes heavy use of UMLS semantic knowledge. A major contribution of our work is that our approach is not restricted to certain entity types, in contrast to other biomedical coreference resolution studies that focus on certain types of biomedical entities (e.g., chemicals, genes, cells [ 2 ], gene/proteins [ 13 , 14 ]). Our study is also distinct in its focus on the impact of anaphora resolution on relation extraction at a large scale. To refine and evaluate our approach, we annotated a set of 320 MEDLINE citations (titles and abstracts) for sortal anaphora. We evaluated our approach in several ways: Evaluation of sortal anaphora resolution on our annotated corpus Partial evaluation of sortal anaphora resolution on the Protein Coreference Dataset used in the BioNLP 2011 shared task [ 15 ] Evaluation of the impact of anaphora resolution on SemRep predications, for which we compared SemRep results with and without anaphora resolution on a separate set of 300 sentences Estimation of the quantitative effect of anaphora resolution at a larger scale, for which we compared the number of predications and relation types extracted by SemRep using anaphora resolution with that extracted without anaphora resolution on 1 million MEDLINE citations The results show that our semantic approach is effective in recognizing sortal anaphora relations and that its incorporation into SemRep allows it to replace generic and uninformative relations with more specific and informative ones. We have incorporated our resolution approach into SemRep, making it an option in semantic processing. The annotated corpus of MEDLINE citations is available at http://skr3.nlm.nih.gov/SortalAnaphora/ . Related work Pioneering work in coreference resolution in general English focused on the interaction of pronominal anaphora with syntactic structure and discourse constraints [ 16 – 18 ]. Availability of corpora annotated for coreference, such as MUC7 [ 19 ], led to the prominence of supervised learning approaches for this task [ 20 – 22 ]. More
