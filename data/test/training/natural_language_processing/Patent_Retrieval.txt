Without going into any controversial issuesregarding the patent system, we approach a very real and growingproblem searching for innovation. The target collection for this taskdoes not consist of patent documents only, but it is in these documentsthat the main difference is found compared to web or news informationretrieval. In addition, the issue of patent search implies a particularuser model and search process model. This review is concerned withhow research and technology in the field of Information Retrieval assistsor even changes the processes of patent search. It is a survey of workdone on patent data in relation to Information Retrieval in the last2025 years. It explains the sources of difficulty and the existing document processing and retrieval methods of the domain, and provides amotivation for further research in the area.1IntroductionInnovation is at the core of technological and societal developments.New ideas on how to make things better, faster, cheaper, and morereliable, or simply on how to make totally new things, are the result ofmany different economical, managerial, and cultural factors. In addition to all these factors, it stands to reason that technology movesforward on the basis of prior technology, and that therefore societyas a whole benefits from public availability of detailed descriptions oftechnical innovation. For this reason, the patent system has been created to encourage inventors to share their knowhow, in exchange fora temporary monopoly. Without approaching any controversial topic,this review looks, from the perspective of Information Retrieval IRresearchers, at methods for benefiting from this amount of information.The search for innovation, as expressed in patent documents, andfor the purposes of obtaining new patents, has two facets the searchfor content and the search for legal information. Most of us, as scientists, are very familiar with the search for content. While performed fordifferent purposes, at its core lies the need to understand a technicalprocess or entity. We achieve this by finding references to similar processes or entities, by analyzing its components and the more general21.1 History and Present 3categories of processes or entities of which it is part. Second, there isthe search for legal information related to the protection granted to theinventor for a specific invention. The two facets often intermingle in thedifferent search use cases described in Section 1.4, but this review willfocus on the former.We begin the introduction with a brief description of the past andpresent of the patent system, in order to provide a context for everything that will be discussed further on. This will also give the readerthe understanding of the specific terminology used in the followingsections. We continue with an overview of the content of patent documents in Section 1.2, illustrated by analyzing an example of a patentin Section 1.3. Section 1.4 gives a description of the most importantpatent search types. Finally, Section 1.5 gives a brief overview of patentresearch in the IR community, and the sources of patent documents.1.1 History and PresentThe term patent stems from the Latin verb patere and means layingopen. As a noun, it is the short form of letters patent, an officialdocument used in the middle ages by an authority to assign specificrights to a person or group. The first patent law in the sense thatwe would imagine it today, i.e., pertaining to inventions, was issuedin Venice in 1474 138, followed by the British Statute of Monopoliesof 1623, the United States in 1790, and France in 1791 11. The fullhistory of the patent law is certainly not the focus here, but rather thepoint that, when approaching this particular field, one has to take intoaccount centuries of practice. The sideeffect of this public disclosure ofinventions is a library of cultural heritage documenting the developmentof human technologies from the middleages to the present day. All this,and more, is priorart to any new patent application.The different laws in different countries result in several possibledefinitions of a patent. According to the World Intellectual PropertyOrganization WIPO 3,a patent is the right granted to an inventor by aState, or by a regional office acting for several States,4 Introductionwhich allows the inventor to exclude anyone else fromcommercially exploiting his or her invention for a limited period, generally 20 years.The conditions under which such a right may be granted may alsoshow slight differences between authorities, but generally four conditions have to be met 11novelty The invention must not have been described or used beforethe applicationinventive step The invention must also not be a new but obviouscombination of existing processes or entitiesindustrial applicability It must be possible to build or use it inpractice e.g., no patent for a perpetuum mobilenonexcluded material It must not refer to areas explicitlyexcluded by law from patenting e.g., natural productsThe modern practice of patent law starts with the Paris Conventionof 1883 207. At the time of writing, there were 174 nations listed ascontracting parties, the latest one being Thailand in 2008. The ParisConvention is the first in a series of international agreements that aimto make the patent system a truly global one. For even though mostlaws take prior art to be any public data anywhere in the world, thepractice is essentially a national one, with only one true multinationalauthority, the European Patent Office EPO.1The Paris Convention lays down one of the fundamental propertiesof the current patent system, the priority. In essence, the Conventionallows the inventor to claim priority on an invention at any patentoffice of a signatory country, based on a prior application heshe madein any other signatory country, generally within 12 months. This system results in the creation of links between documents issued by different patent offices, in different languages, essentially covering the sameinvention. It is a fundamental property that, as we will see in the following sections, has found its utility not only in the search methods,1Even in the case of the EPO, the actual patents are issued by national offices, but theprocedure is greatly simplified.1.1 History and Present 5but also in machine translation, network analysis and evaluation of IRsystems.Priorities create the possibility of building patent families  the setof patents describing the same invention. Depending on how flexible oneis in linking the documents based on their priority references, the families can describe a very specific invention, or a general technical field.Families are however not a legal concept, and just to illustrate this flexibility, let us note that the WIPO, in its Handbook of Industrial Property Information and Documentation 206, identifies five types simple,complex, extended, national, and artificial, while the EPO, on its information Web site,2 gives three definitions and provides links to how somecommercial providers define their understanding of patent families.This difference in definition notwithstanding, there are at least250,000 common applications per year among The Five IP OfficesIP53 i.e., the same application filed at more than one IP5 office 141.This amounts to a considerable body of comparable multilingual data.And, given the way the patent system currently works i.e., applicationsfor the same invention made and examined at different patent offices,a set of independent searchers are creating relevance judgments in anadhoc poolinglike way.4The size of patent corpora is relatively small when compared to thecurrent web corpora ClueWeb09 is 25 terabytes compressed 1, whilenone of the patent corpora available reach the 1 terabyte mark. However, the research issues are still abundant. This review covers the vastmajority of the research already done, as well as points out potentialavenues for the future. When talking to a patent expert, it emergesthat the work still needing to be done for patent retrieval is a mixtureof technology features and legal or administrative issues. While thisreview certainly focuses on the former, the two are surprisingly difficult to extricate from each other. Often enough, procedures are put in2httpwww.epo.orgsearchingessentialspatentfamiliesdefinitions.html3Five patent offices that have agreed to a tighter collaboration in patent prosecution European Patent Office EPO, United States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO, JapanPatent Office JPO, Korean Intellectual Property Office KIPO, and State IntellectualProperty Office of the Peoples Republic of China SIPO.4There are international efforts underway to eliminate this apparent work duplication inorder to speedup patent prosecution.6 Introductionplace to do a good job of searching with the technology of the 1980sor even earlier. A classical example of this would be the creation ofextremely long and complex Boolean queries 24. These proceduresthen become part of what the community generally defines as patentsearch and research is done to adapt to this particular scenario. Thisis a factor to keep in mind when looking beyond the restricted confinesof the described use cases.Adams, in his presentation to the WIPO in 2009 8 and later inhis keynote at the Patent Information Retrieval Workshop in 2011,5identified three areas of development for improving search1 Search strategy development  the human factor2 Database creation and maintenance3 Search engines and information navigation toolsThe three areas all interact with and are dependent on each other, butthe Human Factor and the Database creation and maintenance are notthe subject of this survey. However, it is important for the IR community to understand that although the core algorithm, its supplementaryfeatures and its interfaces are very important, they are just a third ofthe complete process. Furthermore, studies on information navigationand visualization in the IR community are sparse. We will briefly coverthem in Section 4.5.The need for better search engines is however particularly acutenow, as the number of patent applications grows and, together withit, the backlog of patent offices. For instance, as of January 2011, theUnited States Patent and Trademark Office USPTO had a backlogof 1.2 million patent applications 34.1.2 Domains within a DomainA common understanding of a domainspecific search engine is that itlimits its index to pages corresponding to a particular subject area, publisher or purpose 183. This definition covers all aspects of what onemay define as domainspecific search, provided we are slightly liberal5httpifs.tuwien.ac.atpair20111.2 Domains within a Domain 7in its interpretation. The subject area component refers to domainssuch as scientific publications, healthcare, biomedicine, chemistry, etc.The publisher could be perceived as a publicationspecific medium.Text hyperlinked or not, images, and combinations thereof such asnews feeds, blogs or twitter search are examples that come to mind inthis sense. Finally, purpose is better understood as users or use casedomains and implies a connection to the user performing the searchand his or her motivations and objectives. Let us therefore rephrasethis definitionDefinition 1.1. Domainspecific search engine  process is asearch engine  process that fixes one or more of the following threedimensions1 subject area e.g., chemical, biomedical, healthcare2 publication form or medium e.g., blogs, microblogs,books3 users or use case domain e.g., patent search, culturalheritage, expert searchIt should be noted that in reality the three axes are not quite orthogonal. Some use case domains require specific subject areas or publication forms. The lack of perfect orthogonality has however never been anobstacle in IR and we should take this definition in this spirit as well.Figure 1.1 shows a graphical representation of the three axes. As anillustration of a domain, a volume of the space can be used to representa domain in a qualitative way. The domain of healthcare is shown asan example of a domain that covers a more limited subject area, buttargets a large number of users and user scenarios both medical professionals and nonprofessionals regularly search for health and medicalinformation in a large number of scenarios. In contrast, the patentdomain covers chemistry, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and practically all other domains of industry applicable humanknowledge, but focuses on a relatively small number of users and usecases. We develop the discussion on these use cases in the patent domainin Section 1.4.8 Introduction users and usecaseshealthcarechemistryengineering ... textimages...Medical searchPatent searchFig. 1.1 The patent domain cuts across many scientific and technical domains.1.3 A Patent ExampleBefore moving on with this survey, it is worth taking a closer look at thepatent documents that we will often mention in later sections. As withany example, it does not cover all types of patents and aspects of thepatenting process, but it provides the basic understanding necessaryfor subsequent sections. The reader familiar with the domain may skipthis section.Figure 1.2 shows two pages of the US patent application 10256716,related to a very wellknown consumer product. It is clear fromFigure 1.2b that this patent application refers to the navigation modeof an iPod. The title Method and apparatus for accelerated scrollingand generally the first page is much less clear. In fact, this particular application was filed on September 26, 2002, after the first iPodwas released, yet there is no mention of the device by its name inthe text of the application. Instead, this patent application provides adetailed technical description of how the scrolling mechanism for theiPod works. For obvious reasons, we do not reproduce here the full textof the description, but it is available online.6 The application requests6http1.usa.govOq0Wr71.3 A Patent Example 9a The first page b Page 12 of 28Fig. 1.2 Two pages of patent application 10256716.protection for a set of ideas, which it describes in 59 claims. Here arethe first five1 A method for scrolling through portions of a data set, said methodcomprising receiving a number of units associated with a rotational userinput determining an acceleration factor pertaining to the rotationaluser input modifying the number of units by the acceleration factordetermining a next portion of the data set based on the modified numberof units and presenting the next portion of the data set.2 A method as recited in claim 1, wherein the data set pertains to a listof items, and the portions of the data set include one or more of theitems.3 A method as recited in claim 1, wherein the data set pertains to a mediafile, and the portions of the data set pertain to one or more sections ofthe media file.4 A method as recited in claim 3, wherein the media file is an audio file.5 A method as recited in claim 1, wherein the rotational user input isprovided via a rotational input device.As we can see, the claims are written in a particular style, sometimesreferred to as patentese 19, resembling the language of many legal10 Introductioncontracts. In practice this is almost always the case. What one can alsosee from this example is that there are a number of internal referencesbetween claims. In practice, a claim which does not reference any otherclaim is called an independent claim and all others are called dependent claims. In the example above, Claim 1 is independent, while thefollowing four are all dependent, forming a tree of references.Following examination, this patent application was granted a patentin the United States, namely US7,312,785, issued over 5 years afterthe initial application. In this process, the examining office i.e., theUSPTO, in this case published over a hundred documents, covering mostly the communication between the office and the applicants,as well as some procedural notes from the office. Among them, themost interesting for IR researchers are probably the Examiners searchstrategy and results, the list of references cited by the examiner, andthe series of decisions made by the office. In the end, the granted patentUS7,312,785 contains 40 claims only. Figure 1.3 shows two examplesof documents published by the USPTO in relation to this application.a Examiners strategy b List of citationsFig. 1.3 Some documents published by the USPTO in relation to patent application10256716.1.3 A Patent Example 11The US patent offers the owner a monopoly over the manufactureand licensing of the invention only in territories under the US jurisdiction. This is why, 20 days after filing the application with the USPTO,another application was filed with the WIPO WO03036457 on October 16, 2002. Even though the WIPO is not a patent office i.e., it doesnot grant patents, it is the entry point to the so called PCT Route,which is a system designed to facilitate the acquisition of protection indifferent jurisdictions. The name of the route comes from the PatentCooperation Treaty PCT, which establishes the procedures underwhich an application filed with the WIPO reaches the national patentoffices which can grant patents. Without going into the full details ofthe system,7 here is the brief description of the route1 an application is filed with the WIPO2 an International Search Report ISR is created by a SearchAuthority an accredited search organization, generally anational patent office, and published. This phase is referredto as Section 13 an optional further search is performed by a Search AuthoritySection 24 the applicant decides, based on the search reports, whetherto proceed to the national phase. This means that the patentapplication is passed to the set of offices where the applicantdesires protection they are called designated states5 upon receiving the application, the national patent officesstart their own examination procedures, optionally takinginto account the ISR created in the previous steps.Whether the application goes through the PCT route or not, insituations where protection is sought in different jurisdictions for thesame invention, a socalled family of patents results. Figure 1.4 showsthe European and Japanese patents corresponding to the US patentdiscussed before.7Full details about the PCT and PCT applications are available at httpwww.wipo.intpcten. The details of the PCT route are much more complicated than the five bulletpoints presented here.12 Introductiona European granted patent b Japanese applicationFig. 1.4 Family members of US patent 7,312,785.All of the application and granted patent documents will generallyhave the same structure, consisting of Bibliographical data title, metadata related to the specific publication at hand, the inventors, assignees, agents orapplicants, as well as relations to other documents Abstract a very brief summary of the invention Description a detailed description of the invention, including prior work, examples, related technologies Claims the legal description of the invention. Adams 11defines the claims as a Sequence of paragraphs at theend of a patent application defining the scope of monopolysought. After substantive examination, the same section ofthe granted patent defines the legal rights of the proprietor.We will often make references to these sections in the coming sections.1.4 Patent Search Processes 131.4 Patent Search ProcessesWhile, in principle, the search process is always about finding relevantdocuments to satisfy a particular information need, patent search hasspecialized into different processes, differentiated as a function of theinput an idea, a disclosure of innovation, a patent application, a claim,a granted patent and the needed output a large set of scientific publications covering a domain, a set of patents, a single patent. In relationto patent search one will therefore often hear names such as State ofthe art, Prefiling patentability, Novelty, Freedom to operate, Validity, orDue diligence search. Their precise names and definitions vary betweendifferent practitioners.8 Alberts et al. 16 describe in detail five of thesesearch types, but also demonstrate the variability in the definition, byproviding a table with seven search types. Adams 11 adds anothertype of search Alerting and slightly regroups the rest.Generally, these types of search are also related to eDiscoverybecause of their legal nature, which puts a large emphasis on findingall relevant documents. The greatest difference between the practiceof patent searchers and legal staff is perhaps the amount of metadataavailable to patent searchers. As we have seen in the previous example,each published patent document is the result of a specific process andcomes associated with a rich set of metadata.The different types of patent search are summarized in Table 1.1,which shows the type of search and alternative names for it, as well asthe search specification what the search begins from and the corporain which the search is conducted. A short description of each search typeis given in italic text. Figure 1.5 shows the lifecycle of an innovation,with the searches that are directly related to it. The figure describesthe path from having an idea to do something new, i.e., an innovation, to obtaining and defending a patent. It follows four of the sixtypes of search described in Table 1.1, in the order in which they occur,and shows the most important documents that are a result of this process. The rectangles denoting the searches also indicate who typically8By practitioners, we understand here all those who deal with patents in their professionallife. This generally includes corporate librarians, information specialists, private patentsearchers, patent examiners at any patent office, and patent lawyers.14 IntroductionTable 1.1.

Note that a search represented by a rectangle couldtake place over a number of hours or even weeks. The diamonds represent decision points, at which the question Relevant items found isasked, relating to the search just performed. If the response is positive,then a previous step in the process must be repeated.Figure 1.5 does not show the Freedom to operate and Patent portfolio because, as can be seen from Table 1.1, these use cases do not1.4 Patent Search Processes 15Fig. 1.5 Highlevel view of the lifecycle of a patented idea.have a document at the basis of their request for information. Thesetwo types of search can in fact be performed at any time in the courseof the development of an idea into a patented product, as well as anytime thereafter.Finally we should note that in Table 1.1, we refer to all public documents as a particular corpus, but what should be clear to the readeris that theoretically any publicly disclosed knowledge, not necessarilyin written form, can be used to invalidate a patent.The IR scientist reader may by now realize that for the core IRengine design, these different types of patent search do not appear tomake a difference. The principal differences, as we have listed them,have to do with the target data collection or the form in which therequest for information is expressed. The differences lie in the attitudewith which the search process is conducted and the tools that assistthe user in achieving the different objectives of these different patentsearches.Understanding these processes is important for the success ofthe resulting search system and surveys among professional patentsearchers have been conducted in this sense. Hansen 77 have interviewed patent examiners at the Swedish patent office. Tseng andWu 191 have interviewed 43 patent searchers, 18 of which agreedto a followup experimental observation of their search behavior. Mostrecently, Azzopardi et al. 20 followed up with an online survey whichreceived 81 responses. Characteristically, the set of patent search types16 Introductionidentified was also different from the sets of Alberts et al. 16 andAdams 11 mentioned before.Based on these and similar surveys in the context of the PROMISEproject9 94 Participative Research labOratory for Multimedia andMultilingual Information Systems Evaluation, the scenario outlined inListing 1.1 has been crystallized to model the prior art search performedby a patent examiner. This is perhaps the most common type of search,if we do not take into account the technology survey done in the contextof research environments. Nevertheless, the patent examiner at a patentoffice is not the only actor in the field. As Figure 1.5 and Table 1.1indicate, scientists, librarians, and lawyers are also potentially involved.Such user studies reveal aspects that the previous taxonomy did notidentify. The different types of search identified by patent experts themselves have to do, as we have seen, with the final objectives of the searchtask. From an IR researchers point of view, however, the different tasksListing 1.1. Prior Art Search use case.9httpwww.promisenoe.eu1.5 Patents in the IR Community 17are distinguished by the formulations of the queries Boolean, keywordsonly, full text, metadata, images, by the number of sessions requiredin the process, and by the level of collaboration in achieving the desiredgoal. The core difficulty for the IR scientist has to do with the patentdocuments themselves, even if many search types require the corpus tobe the entire, publicly available, human knowledge.1.5 Patents in the IR CommunityThis section reviews the beginnings of IR research in the patent domain,and lists a number of sources of information on IR in the patent domain,as well as sources of patent collections for use in IR research. The firstrecognition of the IR community of the need for special attention tobe dedicated to the issues of patent retrieval was in the organizationof the first Workshop on Patent Retrieval by Kando and Leong 97.However the subject had been approached before by Sheremetyevaand Nirenburg 171 and by Larkey 110. Other studies, for specificdomains particularly chemistry 32, 99 and for business analysis forexample, 42 had appeared even before, but outside of the core IR field.1.5.1 Sources of KnowledgeWork in this domain has been encouraged through evaluation campaigns, first through the NII10 Test Collection for IR SystemsNTCIR 57, 60, 93, 145, 146, and later through the Text RetrievalConference TREC for the chemical domain 129 and continuing atthe moment of writing this review, through the CrossLanguage Evaluation Forum CLEF 156, 157, 158, 161.This survey relies heavily on the proceedings of the SIGIRWorkshopon Patent IR in 2000 97 the ACL workshop on Patent Corpus Processing 4 the special issue of the Information Processing  Management journal 59 the PaIR series of workshops 5, generally colocatedwith the International Conference on Information and KnowledgeManagement CIKM the Advances in Patent Information RetrievalAsPIRe Workshop 76 colocated with the European Conference on10National Institute of Informatics Japan.18 IntroductionInformation Retrieval ECIR in 2010 as well as the reports from theevaluation campaigns mentioned above. A number of other articles haveappeared in various journals, specific to the technology described, andat least another survey has appeared in the World Patent InformationWPI journal 35. The WPI journal is an important source of domainrelated information and while its audience is mostly made up of patentinformation professionals, the IR researcher interested in the domainwould find its articles interesting. Most recently, in 2011, an edited bookhas collected a series of articles focusing on the patent domain 127.A number of other symposia do not have proceedings, but publish the slides online. The Information Retrieval Facility11 IRF hasorganized a symposium between 2007 and 2010, bringing together IRresearchers and IP professionals.12 The various patent offices also organize information events and training sessions.131.5.2 Sources of DataWorking in the patent domain implies having access to collections ofpatent data. Aside from those made available in the various evaluationcampaigns already mentioned previously, patent data can be obtaineddirectly from the patent offices, or from research collections.While all patent offices make available patent data it is one of theircore responsibilities, it is not always easy to obtain it. The USPTOhas its full text database available online14 for manual search, and forbulk download via Google.15 The European Patent Office16 is one ofthe most active in this area, offering both researchers and commercialorganizations free access to their data as well as data they have collectedfrom other offices, via their Open Patent Services OPS.17 A fairusepolicy applies in this case.11httpwww.irfacility.org12httpwww.irfs.at13httpwww.wipo.intmeetingsenindex.jsp, httpwww.epo.orglearningevents.html,httpwww.uspto.govproductseventsindex.jsp14httppatft.uspto.gov15httpwww.google.comgooglebooksuspto.html16httpwww.epo.org17httpops.epo.org1.6 Structure of the Survey 19The Matrixware Research Collection MAREC, first made available by the IRF, consists of approximately 19 million patent documentsin XML format, covering four patent offices USPTO, EPO, JPO, andWIPO. MAREC is now available for download under a Creative Commons license.18 Further sources are the datasets, queries, and relevancejudgments made available in the NTCIR patent track, and CLEFIPand TRECCHEM evaluation campaign tracks.1.6 Structure of the SurveyThe rest of this survey looks in detail at the various aspects of IR in thepatent domain. After this introductory section, we continue in Section 2with a detailed description of evaluation best practices in the field. Wedo this because, on one hand, evaluation is based on the understandingof search processes just described, and, on the other hand, becausein this way we lay the ground for the discussions of results in futuresections. The main focus of the survey is in Section 3, on text indexingand retrieval. We cover there both bagofwords approaches, as wellas those supported by Natural Language Processing NLP methods.Section 4 follows up on the text retrieval discussion with details onmetadata associated with patent documents and how such metadataassists the search process. We cover both existing metadata, as well asexperiments on creating new metadata.Section 5 moves away from textual information and introduces thespecific issues related to image and chemical structure retrieval in thepatent domain. We discuss the importance of the information containedin the nontextual parts of the patent, as well as algorithms that havebeen developed to make use of this information in search.Finally, we summarize the domain in the Conclusions section, andprovide a set of research and development trends observed in recentyears in relation to patent IR.18httpwww.ifs.tuwien.ac.atimpmarec.shtml2EvaluationLaboratorystyle evaluation of search algorithms is a wellestablishedpractice in the IR Community 78. This style of evaluation has beensupported for IR in the patent domain through the organization ofpatent IR tracks in the CLEF, TREC, and NTCIR evaluation campaigns, with the corresponding availability of corpora, queries, and relevance judgments.Throughout all the papers reviewed, numerical results of evaluationexperiments are cited to demonstrate the quality of the new methods,or of their applicability to this particular domain. It is not new in IR toask ourselves to what extent these numbers are significant for the practice of the end users 167. In the patent domain however, the users playperhaps a greater role than in the web or news domain. The usual arguments for laboratorystyle and userbased evaluations apply perfectlywell to this domain, but it is important to realize that here the user isa person who will use the search system as the primary tool in orderto do his or her job. In most cases, the user would have also attendedsome training on how to use a particular system most effectively. Thedecision to change to a new system will not be taken lightly and is nottransparent at all. If in the case of a web search engine, the developer2021may change the ranking scheme without necessarily informing the enduser, changing the retrieval engine behind a patent search service mayhave significant practical and potentially legal consequences.We have recently discussed this gap and complementarity betweenthe practitioners perspective on evaluation and that of the IR community 124. This is not to say that the practitioners do not supportevaluation campaigns such as those organized at NTCIR, CLEF, orTREC. On the contrary  such campaigns would in general not evenbe possible without the support and guidance of patent experts.The question is how do we know what exactly is needed Whatare the factors that lead to a positive assessment of a system Theanswer begins with the word system. If we look at the literature published by professional users assessing search services, it tends to mixtogether, within the same pool of judgments, distinct factors like collection coverage, search performance, efficiency, and usability 18, 52, 140.The most common practice of assessing a system, or demonstratingits performance, is through the very unscientific way of showing anexample. An example has the benefit that it is concise, easy to follow,and conveys a clear message. But this is hardly the way to make adecision.In the PROMISE project, the research partners started from theseexamples and scenarios, and, through interviews and use case modelling, designed more appropriate, and yet still laboratorystyle, evaluation campaigns. Some aspects remain particularly difficult to model.Trippe and Ruthven 189 for instance, answer the very fundamentalquestion of What is success with risk minimization. The argumentis that what the searcher is ultimately trying to achieve is to minimizethe risk of having a patent application rejected, infringing on someone elses in force patent, being excluded from a market because of anew patent, etc. They map the fundamental metrics of IR effectiveness, precision and recall, to the different search tasks and how theyare ordered on the risk scale. They observe that precision is moreappropriate as a match, insofar as it orders the tasks in the same wayas the importance of risk minimization.This is to some extent surprising as the common mantra of PatentIR requires high recall. It is however an expression that only in the22 Evaluationmind of the IR researcher is tightly connected to low precision. Forthe professional searcher, as for any user for that matter, desirable ishigh recall and high precision i.e., that the set of results is ordered byrelevance 160. What makes the user needs of a patent search systemspecial, compared with a generaly search engine, is the lower toleranceto errors in this ranked list. In the practice of patent search, the wayto achieve high precision and high recall is often through a set of highprecision queries. This may explain for instance the popularity thatBoolean search systems still enjoy.In this section, we provide an overview of approaches to bothlaboratorystyle and usercentered evaluation in the patent domain.2.1 Laboratorystyle EvaluationWith patent related tasks in NTCIR, TREC, and CLEF, there is nowa significant amount of data about how IR systems perform on suchcorpora and there are a number of test collections for the evaluationof future systems 58. This section describes the approaches to obtaining relevance judgments and the evaluation metrics used in patent IRevaluation campaigns.2.1.1 Relevance JudgmentsFor the patent domain, it is rarely feasible to obtain manual relevancejudgments from patent search experts. With ever increasing backlogs,the patent offices have few resources to assist research, while privatepractice tends to be outside the budget of research centers. An alternative is to use surrogate relevance judges, for example the use ofchemistry students in the TRECCHEM campaign. More commonlyhowever, approaches have been devised to make use of the citationinformation provided by patent examiners in search reports for thecreation of relevance judgments.With the exception of the NTCIR3 patent retrieval task 93 andthe Technology Survey TS task of TRECCHEM 20092011 126,129, all adhoc retrieval tasks on the patent domain have used theexamination report provided by the patent office as a source of relevancejudgments.2.1 Laboratorystyle Evaluation 23The requests for information in the NTCIR3 patent retrieval taskstarted from a newspaper article and consisted, among others, of fourtext fields article the original newspaper article that generated therequest for information supplement additional information to the article description a short description of the request for information narrative a long description of the request for informationTherefore, the relevance assessments had to be created manually.For the Technology Survey task of TRECCHEM, the desire toinclude scientific articles meant that manual evaluations had to be doneanyway, for even though scientific articles may also be cited in relationto a patent application or even a granted patent, there are technicaldifficulties in extracting and therefore using these citations, since thereis no universal format for referring to nonpatent literature 82. Forall other campaigns however, evaluation is based on citations, but onlypatent citations.The use of citations from the examination reports is probably notoptimal. The examiner is only required to find one relevant documentwhich invalidates the claims in the application, even if hundreds mayexist. This, added to the fact that practice and language familiaritymay restrict the search of the examiner, results in a clearly incompleterelevance judgment set.In a recent study 134, Magdy et al. looked at the number of wordsthat a given patent application had in common with its citations. Theyobserved that the percentage of applications which have no words incommon with any of their cited documents is higher than the percentage of applications which have no words in common with the top fivenonrelevant i.e., not cited documents returned by a system. Thismay seem surprising, but it is part of the features of the collection.In fact, the study above does not take into account the fact that not alldocuments in patent test collections contain all sections, nor that thewords used in a patent describe a technology which obtained a common24 EvaluationTable 2.1. Sources and types of citations for patent documents.Source Type RelevanceApplicant Prior work, which does not destroy novelty. Relevance level 1Examiner A Found by the examiner, but still not novelty destroying.Relevance level 1Examiner Y Partially novelty destroying. In combination with other citationsmay render the new invention obvious and thus notpatentable. Relevance level 12Examiner X Novelty destroying citations. Will generally imply a change inthe claims of the patent application. Relevance level 23Opposition A citation introduced through an opposition procedure aftergrant. Relevance level 23name long after the patent was published for example, touchscreenversus capacitive sensing device.Documents cited in relation to a patent may come from differentsources and these sources may come with assigned levels of relevance.Table 2.1 shows the different sources and types. The relevance levelsmentioned in the table are for indicative purposes only, with a highervalue indicating higher relevance.The opposition citations are particularly interesting because theyare, as a rule, extremely accurate. The opposition procedure is availableat most of the major patent offices to account for the fact that the examiner might have missed significant documents. Practically, it crowdsources the examination. As competitors monitor the IP landscape inwhich they operate, they will put in effort to oppose a granted patent.At the same time, opposing a patent without success will strengthenthe patent and make it much more difficult to litigate after a failedopposition. The procedure is therefore not taken lightly and the citations submitted by the competitor are, in general, extremely relevant.The problem in using them for an evaluation campaign is that they arecomparatively rare.To increase the number of citations, the CLEFIP 161 and TRECCHEM campaigns have used patent families to identify related documents to both the citing and cited documents. This is particularlyuseful if the task at hand is a general stateoftheart search, whereeven tangentially related documents are interesting for the searcher. Interms of ranking systems however, the use of expanded citations with2.1 Laboratorystyle Evaluation 25patent family members has not been shown to produce significantlydifferent rankings compared to those obtained in evaluations based onlyon direct citations 128.When citations are not available, either because the topic is not apatent document as in NTCIR3 or the results are expected to bemore than patents TRECCHEM TS task, manual relevance judgments must be created, and bestpractices of standard evaluation campaigns should be followed 166.2.1.2 MetricsOne of the questions in doing the evaluation is to what extent existingmetrics apply to the new domain.In general, the patent domainfocused evaluation campaigns organized so far have used wellknown metrics. Practically all have reportedresults in terms of Mean Average Precision MAP, and precision andrecall at different levels. The different relevance levels have been takeninto account by also reporting nDCG values Normalized DiscountedCumulative Gain. The incompleteness of the citation lists has lead tothe reporting of bpref binary preference values aswell. For the invaliditytask, a more appropriate metric might beMean Reciprocal Rank MRRas, in principle, only one document is needed to invalidate a claim.While all of these metrics are informative and useful, there hasalso been an attempt to introduce a more specific metric. The PatentRetrieval Evaluation Score PRES 133, 132 is a recallfocused evaluation metric, designed to map the recalloriented perception of patentretrieval effectiveness into a numeric value. It takes into account thefact that a professional patent searcher is likely to go deeper into the setof results to find a relevant document, and therefore does not penalizeas heavily as MAP or MRR the existence of nonrelevant documents atthe top ranks, but instead penalizes systems that return fewer relevantdocuments more heavily.The problem with all of the metrics is that we still do not know howwell they correlate to user satisfaction in this particular domain. A verysmall study was presented in 128, but the results were inconclusivebecause only 12 topics could be manually evaluated by experts.26 Evaluation2.2 Humans in the LoopUserbased evaluation is important in any IR evaluation study, butnotoriously difficult to do. The problem is intensified in this domain,where privacy and confidentiality is paramount, hourly costs are inline with lawyers practices, and communication between end users andresearchers is limited and difficult.Despite these difficulties, there have been initial steps, both inincluding users in the evaluation of laboratorystyle campaigns andin designing interactive campaigns such as the PatOlympics 125.The PatOlympics invited research teams to present their patentretrieval systems in a competitivedemo session, where patent expertsuse the systems to answer a particular request for information. Thecomparability of the results in the end is supported by the provision ofa common corpus for all participants, the equal opportunity to interactwith the patent expert, and the pooling of results identified as relevantduring the event itself. The disadvantages are first, the experts perception of the topic changes as he or she sees more documents, so if ateams turn to interact with an expert is at the end of the event, theexpert will be more likely to know exactly what to look for. This ismitigated by the fact that the teams and experts interact in a roundrobin fashion, so all teams will experience both the advantage and thedisadvantage of this change in an experts familiarity with the topic.Second, and most significant, the number of topics is extremely limited25 topics due to the limited time available for such an event.Finally, let us observe that humans are in the loop in the adoptionof techniques in practice. While getting insights into internal companysystems is practically impossible, recently some systems based on published research have been made available to the public 85. Their success, and implicitly evaluation, remains to be decided by the users theyattract.2.3 SummaryThe definitions of success given by the IR researchers and the IP professionals differ. They are not conflicting, but complementary. The patent2.3 Summary 27domain is not unique in its need to consider the needs of the users, butin this case, the users are knowledgeable about the data, the searchsystems and even the expected results 16. If in web or newswire searcheach of us can, with reasonable accuracy, imagine what the user doesand needs, patent searchers are trained professionals, whose searchresults are difficult to replicate with adhoc search. That being said,the need to clearly identify the real performance of core componentsis as present as ever, and there is a huge number of resources at ourdisposal. The examination reports, performed at patent offices aroundthe world, are invaluable. Only the peerreview process of scientific literature comes close to it, but it lacks the structure and unique globalidentifiers that the patent system has.The importance of users in this domain has lead to systems beingevaluated by comparison with best practices in the field. This opensup a difficult modelling problem changes and improvements in searchtechnology, as triggered by evaluation campaigns, lead to changes inbest practices. The users are always right, but a balance is to be foundbetween a tradition of best practice, and innovative practices.3Text RetrievalText retrieval is the core business of many in the IR community andconsequently this particular approach to patent retrieval has seen a lotof attention in the past 10 years. This section discusses the differencesbetween general text retrieval problems and we refer here to weband news corpora examples and those in the patent domain.Before we begin, we need to observe that full text search is a relatively new experience in the patent retrieval systems. The incumbentshere are manually created indices of semantic data and it is important to understand the difficulties that a fulltext search system hasto face in improving existing practice 9, 10. The manually createdindices, such as summaries, keywords or chemical lists, cannot copewith an ever growing amount of data, but from the users perspective,they are extremely important because they provide a level of qualitystill unmatched by automated processes. The requirements for Information Retrieval systems are therefore very demanding, particularly inthe areas of query syntax and information extraction.This section begins with a discussion on the differences betweenpatent and nonpatent literature and of the challenges in the processingof patent literature. This is followed in Section 3.2 by a review of current283.1 Patent versus Nonpatent Literature 29approaches to processing and indexing patent documents. Finally, theimportant topics of query syntax and multilinguality are discussed inSections 3.3 and 3.4, respectively. We should note that although it istechnically still text, the extensive metadata associated with a patentand its use in patent processing and search are not discussed here, butin Section 4.3.1 Patent versus Nonpatent LiteratureThe motivation of this survey is the need to process patent documentsdifferently from other collections. In the first section, we have seen thebackground of this problem i.e., the legal patent system and its motivations. We have seen that this background generates specific searchtasks which define what patent retrieval means for the practitioner.This section explores the effects of this background on the text itselfand, indirectly, on the Information Retrieval researcher and the methods he or she develops to tackle the problem at hand. We compare thetext of a patent collection with that of a general corpus consisting, forexample, of news or web data.3.1.1 Term DistributionsThe largely empirical methods of Information Retrieval rely heavily onassumptions about the relationship between the frequency of occurrence of terms in a document and the topic of the document. It hasoften been said, and there are many anecdotal examples, that patentdocuments are more difficult than other documents used in IR tests.We start by looking at the collection term frequencies. It is well knownthat term frequencies follow a Zipfian distribution, and that the plot offrequencies against ranks on logarithmic axes should be, approximately,a line. Figure 3.1 shows this plot for the CLEFIP 2011 corpus 157and for the American National Corpus ANC19 88. For the latter, thefrequency figures are provided by the corpus creators online. Althoughthe figures vary between the two corpora,20 the plot is made such that19httpamericannationalcorpus.org20Technically, the CLEFIP is not a corpus, but just a collection of documents, since itdoes not have any linguistic annotations.30 Text Retrieval100101102103104105100 101 102 103 104100101102103104105106107108100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107ANC Collection frequency logscaleCLEF Collection frequency logscaleANC Rank logscaleCLEF Rank logscaleAmerican National CorpusCLEFIP 2011 English CorpusFig. 3.1 Term frequencies in patents versus standard American English.the two extremes top left corner and lower right corner match. Theyappear to be similar, but we should not forget that these are logarithmic plots. What matters here is the second derivative of the curves therate at which the frequency changes. Compared to a corpus of regular American English, the patent corpus decreases the frequency muchfaster. This means that it is rich both in high frequency and low frequency terms, but poor in average frequency terms. One of the reasonsfor this is the presence of text obtained by Optical Character Recognition OCR in the corpus 185 and the errors introduced by the OCRprocess, but also the nature of the text. As is often the case in legaltexts, the authors of the Claims sections do not shy away from repeating the same term over and over again, wherever deemed necessary toclarify the object or procedure being claimed.The second aspect to observe is the specificity of the terms used inthis corpus. Given the relationship between term specificity and document frequency DF 96, we can make an inference about the specificity of each section by looking at the average DF of the terms within it.Figure 3.2 shows the distribution of the average document frequency ofterms in the three sections of a patent document, as a percentage of thetotal number of sections of that type. For comparison, the figure alsoshows the average DF in documents of the Open American National3.1 Patent versus Nonpatent Literature 31100101102103104105106 0  20  40  60  80  100Number of documents log scaleAverage DF of terms in section, as percentage of total documentsAbstractsClaimsDescriptionsAmerican National CorpusFig. 3.2 Average Document Frequency distribution, per sectionss.Corpus the free version of the ANC. Extreme cases are visible in thepatent data, such as those four documents whose average DF is 80of the total number of documents. Even without these extremes, mostDescription sections have an average DF of over 25 of the size of thecorpus.3.1.2 Natural Language Processing IssuesIn addition to the issues related to the frequency and distributionof terms, a text processing method may need to take into accountthe structure of the sentences, the frequency and distribution of nounphrases NP rather than terms, and the frequency of outofvocabularyterms.Among the research done in this area, most emphasis was placed onthe Claims section of patents. This has two reasons first, the claims arethe legally binding description of the invention second, because theyare legally binding, they are written in the patentese mentioned in theIntroduction. Claims tend to have longer sentences, a complex structure and use uncommon terms 173. While these facts about claimshave been mentioned consistently in numerous publications, numericalobservations about them are given in 150, 197.32 Text RetrievalVerberne et al. 197 used a set of 67,292 Claims sections extractedfrom the 400k patent document corpus made available for the AsPIReworkshop 76, to which they applied a sentence splitter using both thefull stop and the semicolumn as delimiters, followed by the AEGIRdependency parser 106. They compared their results with statisticsfrom the British National Corpus BNC 112. They found that theaverage Claims sentence has 53 words, while the median is 22. Comparing with the BNC, where the peak of the distribution is at 10 words,patent claim sentence length distribution peaks at 20 words per sentence. To put a figure on the outofvocabulary issue, they comparedthe coverage of the patent corpus by the CELEX lexical database 22.In terms of token coverage, this was found to be better 96 than a general corpus 92. However, in terms of types i.e., unique tokens, thecoverage dropped to 55, suggesting that there is a high tokentotyperatio. This observation was later detailed by the authors in a followuparticle 150. We will come back to this shortly. This issue is not specificto English or western patenting practices. A similar observation wasmade about Japanese claims by Shinmori et al. 173, though withoutan extensive study. An extensive comparison of issues between Englishand Japanese in patent practice and language is presented by Lise 117.Interestingly, Verberne et al. did not find significant differencesbetween the lexical frequencies of ambiguous words in this case, wordswhich can be assigned multiple parts of speech. Instead, they foundthat multiword terms in patent claims tend to not appear even inspecialized dictionaries we found that fewer than 2 of the twowordNPs from specialist occurs in the marec subcorpus.21 This againsupports the intuition that patent claims, by definition, describe inexisting, common words, new things, the expression of which is therefore not found in existing dictionaries.A third challenge mentioned by Shinmori 173 is the complicatedsyntactic structure of the claims. While the results here are obtainedfrom a small set of 100 short sentences, and therefore are inconclusive, Verberne et al. argue that the main cause of failure for syntactic21The specialist lexicon is a lexicon covering both common English terms and biomedicalvocabulary 37.3.1 Patent versus Nonpatent Literature 33analyzers is that the claims are not mainly formed of clauses i.e., donot always have a subject and a predicate, but rather noun phrases.This is a feature of patent practice because of the restriction of theUSPTO that the claims have to consist of a single sentence 2. Theresulting text is not always easy to read, and often difficult to processautomatically. The subject and predicate are often in the title of theclaims section, which can be I claim or We claim.3.1.3 Document Length IssuesFinally, we observe that patent documents tend to be quite lengthyin nature. Iwayama et al. 92 use the test collections of NTCIR3 tocompare a patent corpus consisting of Japanese patent applications anda news corpus consisting of Mainichi newspaper articles. Their resultsshow that the patent documents have approximately 24 times as manyterms as news documents. At the same time, the standard deviationof the distribution of lengths for patent documents is 20 times that ofnews articles.Length normalization methods have, however, been available forover 15 years, and a version thereof is part of the standard BM25model for a full discussion, see 159. Iwayama and colleagues do notin fact observe a difference in the relative performance of the nineretrieval models they try on the two collections. The question is therefore only if there are ways to better manage huge documents in orderto increase the absolute retrieval scores. We will examine this problemin more detail in the next section on patent document processing, butit is worth taking a moment to understand why patent documents arelonger.As discussed in 159, increased length of a document may come fromone of two sources either the document talks about a unitary topic,but is verbose in doing so or the document covers more topics. Theassumption in patents is that they are simply verbose. This is supportedby the idea that a patent covers one invention and therefore one topic.However, we should not forget that what exactly an invention is maybe differently understood at different patent offices. For instance, theUSPTO allows an application to be amended by the applicant with a34 Text Retrievalsocalled ContinuationinPart application CIP.22 The EPO does nothave such an option, and in this case the applicant is generally advisedto file a new application altogether. Additionally, each examiner maydecide whether a document describes a single invention or not, in whichcase it is possible that one invention is assigned one patent by one officeand multiple patents by another. This means that, despite the intuitionthat a patent should cover a single invention, and that therefore theissue of long patents is only related to the verbosity of the text, we dohave to consider the other variant as well. Namely, we have to take intoaccount that a patent document may be discussing sufficiently differenttopics to consider each as a separate piece of information.3.2 Patent Document ProcessingBased on the observations above, in this section we will discussapproaches to process the documents to improve retrieval. In the courseof doing so, we will mention the results obtained by various researchgroups, but the reader should note that often these are based on different collections, and are therefore rarely comparable. Also by processing, we understand here weighting in the case of Vector Space ModelsVSM or Probabilistic Models PM, or model creation in the case ofLanguage Models LM.We follow, in large, the structure of the previous section, focusingfirst on bagofwords approaches, followed by NLPbased approaches.Before we begin however, we should note that stateoftheart Information Retrieval models are not easy to improve upon. In 196, Verberne and Dhondt use the text of the claims in an offtheshelf Lemurinstance using TFIDF, and rank 6th and 35th in the 70 runs submitted to CLEFIP 2009, according to normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain nDCG and Mean Average Precision MAP, respectively.Figure 3.3 shows the result obtained by an equally offtheshelf SolrLucene instance in the CLEFIP 2011 test collection outside of the officially submitted runs. Both the LemurIndri and SolrLucene resultsshow that even a basic IR instance can achieve an average, or22A CIP application follows up on a previous application and is generally used to protectenhancements of a previously disclosed method or device.3.2 Patent Document Processing 350 20 40 60 80 100Ni.2Ni.1Ni.3Hy.2Hy.1Lu.1Lu.3Lu.2Lu.4Ch.2Ch.1Ch.4Hy.5Hy.6Wi.2Wi.1Wi.7Wi.5Ch.6Ni.4Ch.5Hp.1bprefCLEF 2011 runsLucene ab14.78 Lucene abdescclm47.36 Fig. 3.3 SolrLucene performance on the CLEFIP 2011 test collection, when using thefull text, as well as just the abstracts.

This figure shows the bpref value similar plots had been obtained for MAP, which is appropriate for thesearch reportbased qrels used in the patent domain, as described inSection 2.1.2.3.2.1 Bagofwords ApproachesBefore we talk about words, we need to mention tokenization. Mostarticles cited in the following do not identify specific changes to thetokenization procedure, although this is arguably important. Particularly in chemistry patents 129, the tokenization procedure must takecare not to include artificial tokens extracted from textual representation of chemical formulae into the general index.Iwayama et al. 93 are the first in presenting a study comparingdifferent weighting techniques and their results as applied to patentand news corpora. Table 3.1 shows the nine scoring functions used23common notations, see 93 for details.23 It is unclear why BM25F was not used in this case, as fields are always present in thetarget documents.36 Text RetrievalTable 3.1.

Also to note from their experiments isthat using the full text of the patent documents in the search process,rather than restricting to specific sections claims, abstracts24 improvesresults. This was also subsequently observed in 50, 61, 68. The onlyreversal of ranking that grabs attention is that when using the originalarticle that generated the topic see the description of NTCIR topics inSection 2.1.1, aided by the supplementarymemorandum added by thetopic creators, the ranking of the top two performing models is reversed.In fact, it decreases the performance of BM25 by almost 40. The difference must lie in the fact that while the article and supplementary datawerenotwrittenwith a search task inmind, thedescription andnarrative,added by Iwayama and colleagues, was more specific.Fujita 61 continues this analysis by comparing a BM25variantweighting with a language modelling approach with different smoothing methods Dirchlet or JelinekMercer and priors documentlengthor IPC25. This particular study focuses on the effects of the document24The article does not show results for using the description section of the patents.25 International Patent Classification, see Section 4.2.3.2 Patent Document Processing 37length on the scoring of the retrieval model. In the end, Fujita concludes that in both cases probabilistic and language model, retrievalis improved when the model penalises long documents. In the case ofthe BM25, this is done by setting the b parameter to larger values 0.9to 1 is suggested here for the patent domain, compared to just 0.3 to0.4 for news corpora.A number of subsequent systems have used TFIDF 74, 83,BM25F 28, 56, 68, 136, 154, language modelling 95, 134, 215, or acombination thereof 214. Comparing them directly is not always possible. An exception is made by the systems participating in or using thecollections of evaluation campaigns. Even in these cases however, theymost often combine some form of similarity metric or term weighting, with some form of query generation. We discuss the latter inSection 3.3.3.2.2 Latent Semantic AnalysisBefore moving forward, we also mention distributional semantics, ofwhich Latent Semantic Indexing LSI is the posterchild. The aim ofsuch technologies is to discover patterns between terms, or betweenterms and documents, and use them in the ranking process.Latent semantic indexing is known to improve retrieval effectiveness 62, but in the patent domain its effects are still unclear. Whilethere exists at least one provider who uses it 163,26 LSI has not beenshown to improve results in the patent domain. In fact, there are fewstudies in this sense. Chen et al. 43 observed that their system, basedon Differential LSI DLSI, a variant proposed earlier by them, does notperform well and suggest a scheme to use DLSI as a firstlevel filteringscheme and apply a dynamic programming method to find syntactictemplates matching the query. No effectiveness results are presentedhere, but a later study confirmed that LSI did not improve resultscompared to the standard VSM 139. Instead, Latent Semantic Analysis may find its way as an assisting technology, rather than relyingfully on its ability or inability to detect document similarity 64.26At the time of writing of this review however, no reference to LSI was to be found on thecompanys Web site httpwww.freepatentsonline.com.38 Text RetrievalA possible problem with distributional semantics methods, as wellas with the bagofwords approach in the patent domain, is whatexactly should be considered as a word. As mentioned in the previoussection, at least in the Claims section, but also in the other parts of apatent document, multiple, common words are used together to definea new concept. Tseng et al. 190 propose a method to generate wordngrams by traversing backwards through the text after tokenizationand keeping maximally repeated sets of words. A set is taken to bemaximal if none of its ordered subsets of length at least two occursmore frequently than itself. The proposed processing also includesthe use of stopwords and stemming, but it is unclear which stopwords were used. In general, a domain specific stopword list would bepreferable 33.The expansion from bagofwords to larger indexing units is particularly tempting in this domain. As Dhondt et al. 51 observe, thismay become too specific and damage recall. Nonetheless, given thatsyntactic structures are, as we observed in the previous section, someof the most distinctive characteristics of patent documents, the nextsection lists some of the approaches in this sense.3.2.3 Natural Language ProcessingThe use of NLP techniques to enhance retrieval is certainly not anattempt specific to the patent domain. The inherent problems of thebagofwords model and the potential of NLP have been discussed atlength. We found the tutorial of Smeaton at ESSIR95 useful for anoverview 176. This particular section deals with the applications ofsuch processing for the purposes of indexing e.g., tokenization andweighting.Given that parsers are even less likely to provide reliable results onthe complex syntactic structure of patent documents and in particularof patent claims, the question is what to expect of NLP techniques inthis domain, and in particular for retrieval. This being said, experiments at the University of Hildesheim 28 do show improvements inrecall when using phrases rather than terms, but still are outperformedby other systems not using phrases 158.3.2 Patent Document Processing 39A central focus in the research community is on processing theclaims section of a patent, as that is where one has both the legallybinding content and the most differences with respect to newswireor web corpora. The purpose is, on one hand, to improve retrieval,but often to simply make the claims readable to the public withouta degree in Law. Surprisingly enough, one of the first research publications in this area handled not the problem of understanding thewritten claims, but rather that of writing them. As Sheremetyeva indicates, the difficulty of the task is not constrained only by syntax andstyle. A claim must be composed so as to make patent infringementdifficult 171, 172. This means that the claim must be neither toorestrictive, nor too broad, neither too clear, nor too opaque. The existence of such an automated system to generate claims would indicate that perhaps the claims are still not as difficult as commonlythought. If they can be generated automatically, maybe they can alsobe reverseengineered to the core concepts. Unfortunately, reading justa few claims is enough to understand that this is not the case. Whilethe patent claim generation system that resulted from this research isavailable commercially as AutoPat,27 it is unclear to what extent it isadopted, and to what extent an applicant would have to change theoutput of the system to adapt it to their needs.Making the claim text more understandable to the reader involvestwo aspects. First, the structure of the claim section needs to be madevisible. Second, terms may need explanations.The claim section of a patent generally includes several claims,which are often connected to each other in a dependence relationship. As mentioned in Section 1.3, a claim is said to be independentif it does not make reference to another claim and dependent otherwise. The process of uncovering the structure of the claim sectionresults in a tree potentially a forest, with independent claims asroots, and dependent claims as intermediary or leaf nodes. This kindof structure leads to the use of rhetorical structure theory in orderto link cascading definitions 170, 173. Furthermore, this tree can berefined by using claimspecific cue words in order to recognize lists or27httpwww.lanaconsult.comindex.html40 Text Retrievalrelationships between terms. Both Shinmori et al. 173 and Sheremetyeva 170 use such keywords. Shinmori first identifies six types of relations in claims procedure, component, elaboration, feature,precondition, and compose and then identifies for each a set of cuewords. Sheremetyeva first identifies the cue words and then associatesa range of morphological, semantic and syntactic properties to them.In both cases, a combination of dependency parsers and context freegrammars is used to generate the enriched claim structure.Later, Parapatics and Dittenbach 153 took advantage of developments in the area and used an offtheshelf parser 49 to obtain ahigh percentage of successful parses, after a claim segmentation processsimilar to the ones just mentioned. In the process, they describe a verycomprehensive list of types and patterns in claims.As mentioned, the utility of such techniques is not found in retrieval,but rather in making the claims understandable to the common reader.While all the articles of the previous two paragraphs mention paraphrasing and summarization as applications, the articles do not showspecific results. BouayadAgha et al. 36 make this step in the context of the PatExpert project.28 Alternatively, the conceptual graphsextracted by the methods just described may be compared automatically, as in 211. The utility of this latter approach for the patent usersis however still to be determined.NLP methods may also be used to identify more precisely terms ofinterest. Such terms may carry particular information, and may needfurther explanation for the reader. In relation to the claim structuredetection method, Shinmori et al. 173 also propose the use of thedescription section to provide context to specific terms. They use afairly intuitive method based on heuristic rules to identify the terms,and keyword search on the description section to extract context.One of the issues observed in attempting to process claims usingparsers is that a specific lexicon is needed. Sheremetyeva had generatedone, but did not provide details of coverage 170. Oostdijk et al. 151create such a lexicon semiautomatically, and show that it covers 86.528httpwww.patexpert.org3.3 Query Creation, Modification, and Enhancement 41of the types found in the MAREC patent corpus, compared to only60.4 coverage obtained by a general purpose lexicon.3.3 Query Creation, Modification, and EnhancementRegardless of how well the indexer manages to process the patentcollection, the ultimate results will also depend on asking the rightquestions, or, in this case, on generating the most effective queries.The nature of the domain, where a typical use case scenario impliesbeginning the search upon receiving a patent application, increases thenecessity to process the request for information e.g., a full patent application, an innovation disclosure in order to be able to efficiently searchthe index.Sometimes however, some documents may not be retrieved at all,by any query. This is the study of Findability, first introduced to thepatent domain by Azzopardi and Vinay 21 and expanded by Bacheand Azzopardi 23. The idea is that the index of a particular documentmay be such that, regardless of the terms used in the query, there willalways be other documents obtaining a higher score, given a specificranking function. The relationship between the queries and the differentretrieval methods is explored in depth by Bashir and Rauber 27.As a rule, all papers describe some form of query generation whendiscussing patent retrieval. Even the offtheshelf Lucene implementation used in the generation of Figure 3.3 incorporates within its MoreLike Thisfunctionality a term selection mechanism. It is clear thatquery generation is significant, but there are only a handful of studieswhere the matter is specifically targeted. For the rest, we can hypothesize that the query generation method played a specific part in themore or less successful runs, but it remains impossible to tell whichcomponent of the retrieval system had the most significant impact onthe results.We can hypothesize, for instance, that some approaches may be toosimplistic. For instance, Wanagiri et al. 202 use the top 10 keywordsaccording to the TFIDF version of Salton and Buckley 165. Thisappears to be provide too little information and most likely also toocorrupted by the direct use of the term frequency in the weight. We can42 Text Retrievallearn more from Xue and Croft 208, 209 who cover more weightingschemes and different fields. In particular, they find that the optimalquery length, for their test collection, is around 30 terms. However,since the collection used is not a standard one, results are not comparable. At the same time, Xue and Croft show that using a particularfield of the US patent format, the brief summary of the invention,achieves the best results, followed by using the full text. This field isunfortunately only a feature of the US patent applications.Prior to these, Itoh et al. 89 attempt to weight terms in the querybased on their perceived significance in the target corpus, combinedwith their significance in the query. To measure this significance, different term weighting schemes are used. The proposed method doesnot take into account the fact that some terms, while being importantto the definition of the request for information, may not necessarilyappear in the target set at all. For query term selection purposes, itwould seem more useful to weight them based only on the genre towhich the query belongs, rather than the genre of the target collection.An enhanced version of this is to use language models for both thequery and the target collection. PerezIglesias et al. 154 select thequery terms based on the difference between the language model of thetopic document and the collection. They consider of interest the termswhich appear frequently in the query, but not so frequently in the collection. Results are average. A similar approach was taken by Mahdabiet al. 136, although here the language model was more refined.The problem with having a full document as a query is that, asdescribed in Section 3.1.3, it might refer to multiple topics. Even inthe case of a single invention, different components of the new deviceor process may have their own prior art and generating one query forall may produce poor results for all. This is particularly important inthe case of technology survey tasks, where all aspects of a field arerequested though arguably, in this case, the queries will be generatedby humans. Mahdabi et al. continued their study using language modelling for the query and collection with a study on applying a summarization technique, a version of TextTiling, and generating a model foreach summary 135. The results reported are however inconclusive. Theproblem is that splitting the request for information and recombining3.3 Query Creation, Modification, and Enhancement 43the search results obtained for each such subrequest introduces a newset of parameters to be investigated. The subtopics discovered in apatent application may be of different significance. It is perfectly reasonable that the Description section talks in detail about existing work,but none of the relevant documents for such a subtopic is likely to becited in the examination procedure as invalidating the application athand. Takaki et al. 182 show that with different weights assigned tothe different topics, the retrieval results can be improved. Even withoutweighting however, Ganguly et al. 63 obtain good results by segmenting the Description section using TextTiling, as Mahdabi before, butalso using the Title, Abstract, and Claims sections as additional subqueries. The difference here is that they add, for each of the subqueries,a pseudorelevance feedback loop. We will come back to this shortly.We return briefly to the use of natural language processing techniques, discussed in the previous section, to note that while all thequery generation methods mentioned so far rely on terms, encouragingresults have been recently obtained using phrases. An early result waspresented by Osborn et al. 152 in the late 90s, when they showedthat using an NLPbased grouping of terms results in a performanceincrease compared to the bagofwords approach, even if the increaseis smaller than in a nonpatent collection i.e., Tipster in their experiments. Later, Dhondt et al. 51 use a query term extraction based ontriples generated after a dependency parser was run on the topic document. Verma and Varma use keyphrase extraction techniques basedon the results of a partofspeech tagger 199.A less strict version of the query generation methods describedabove would be to simply allow the user to select the terms 116. Evenmore, complex Boolean queries may be automatically suggested to theprofessional used to this form of interaction with the system 100.Finally, there are those methods that not only use the request forinformation or the target data to select a proper query, but also theresults obtained in a first try, i.e., pseudo relevance feedback methods.Adaptations of the original Rochio method, as well as a new method,capable of taking into account the degree of relevance, are applied to theNTCIR3 test collection 101. The results do not show an improvementin retrieval performance in this case. This may be traced back to the fact44 Text Retrievalthat patent retrieval does appear to produce less good results than aretrieval method applied on a general domain, since a pseudorelevancefeedback PRF method will only enhance what is found in the topretrieved documents. However, it may be that the documents are toolong and cover too many topics, as discussed in Section 3.1.3. This issuggested by Ganguly et al. 63, who first use a query segmentationprocedure, based on TextTiling, similar to that of 135, and applyPRF on the results of each subquery. Then, they merge the resultsvia roundrobin. In this case, the PRF method is also quite standard,so we can assume with some degree of confidence that the significantimprovements shown are due to the more precise queries. A good surveyof query expansion techniques, including PRF, as applied to the patentdomain, is presented by Magdy and Jones 131.A final note on a method not reviewed in the above survey, but stillof interest, despite the poor results. Sahlgren et al. 164 used RandomIndexing to identify terms to use for query expansion in Japanese.While the method had performed well in nonpatent CrossLanguageInformation Retrieval CLIR, it is unclear still whether its failure inthe context of the NTCIR patent retrieval task comes from the patentdomain or from the lack of familiarity of the authors of this particularstudy with the Japanese language. We move on to the issues of multiplelanguages next.3.4 MultilingualityAs mentioned in Section 1, the patent system is an essentially multilingual one. Hence, machine translation and crosslingual InformationRetrieval CLIR are essential. This is reflected in the focus given toCLIR in two evaluation campaigns NTCIR and CLEFIP. As a result,there are a number of systems available for searching patents in differentlanguages. Also as a result, there exist lexicons and parsers dedicatedto the patent domain in several widely used languages, such as English,Japanese, Spanish, French, and German 36, 151, 173. Essentially theproblem of handling different languages is not a patent specific one,but the specific genre see Section 3.1.2 is an additional factor on topof everything else that has been discussed in the literature 149.3.4 Multilinguality 45So far, language specific studies are extremely limited. Among nonAsian languages, one of the features that exists only in some languagesbut not in others notably, not in English is compound words. German,Dutch, and the Nordic languages use such words, which consist of morethan one constituent e.g., Patentamt DE  Patent office EN.Using decompounding is found to help retrieval performance both forSwedish 17 and German 113. Jochim et al. 95 compare the useof phrase and term translations for retrieval, and find that the firstimproves French topics, while the second German ones. The explanation is that without decompounding, terms in German have the informational content of phrases in English or any other noncompoundinglanguage.The familiar approach of query translation is extensively used inthe patent domain as well. Fujii and Ishikawa use it for JapaneseEnglish CLIR 56 in the context of NTCIR3. Additionally, they haveused patent families to return a document different to the one actuallyretrieved, but within the same area of technology. In fact, the use ofpatent families for creating parallel or comparable corpora for statistical machine translation has found a considerable appreciation 122. Asummary of all other crosslingual experiments at NTCIR3 is in 102.However, all of these observations would potentially apply to anyother domain, and a comprehensive book on CLIR provides contextto all of them 149. What is specific to the patent domain, but hasnot been thoroughly analyzed in any of these works, is how good thetranslation is. Statistical Machine Translation SMT systems are onlyas good as the training data they are trained on, and they must beadapted to the patent domain 41. But perhaps a fullblown SMT isnot necessary for query translation. After all, what is needed is notnecessarily a properly formed sentence, but the correct keywords. Sucha bilingual thesaurus may be learned directly from the corpus at hand,using hypernym and hyponym relations 148.Query translation is not the only option for crosslingual retrieval.Recently, Li and ShaweTaylor presented a study, also on the NTCIR3collection, using Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis KCCA 115.The retrieval results show indistinguishable MAP values compared tomonolingual runs.46 Text RetrievalFinally, let us note that translation may not necessarily be betweenlanguages, but also between genres 147. The same method used byNanba et al. 148 to learn a bilingual thesaurus is used again by theteam, in conjunction with references between patents and scientific articles, to learn the different ways of expressing the same thing in the twodifferent genres. For instance, their method is able to learn that a TVCamera may be referred to in a patent as a photographic device,image shooting apparatus, or image pickup apparatus.3.5 SummaryFrom the use of moreorless offtheshelf IR models, methods or tools,we have seen that the bagofwords approach, without any enhancement related to metadata present in the patent, stands its ground.What seems to consistently work is using the full text of the document, but using different fields using here the Lucene terminology forthe different sections. This means that the term weighting is done perfield and this makes perfect sense considering the different genres inthe different sections of the document. Additionally, the studies presented in this section have provided ambiguous results in terms of theutility of using metadata IPC, inventors, assignees, etc. in the searchprocess. However, this deserves a more careful analysis, and we look inmore depth at the use of metadata in Section 4.Latent semantic methods, although apparently used in a few commercial services, show inconclusive results. Given their success in otherIR domains, their study should be encouraged in order to clearly assesstheir utility in the case of patent search.In terms of query generation, there are positive results that significantly improve retrieval performance, but also negative experiences.Interestingly, Zhao and Callan 216 indirectly reflect on one of the fundamental properties of patent retrieval systems the experience of theprofessional searcher. They describe how Indri performed better usingautomated queries than using manual queries generated by an inexperienced user. While the study is only on the six topics of the TechnologySurvey task of TRECCHEM 2011 126, and an additional one fromPatOlympics 125, it shows both that a stateoftheart search system3.5 Summary 47is able to assist the casual searcher, but must allow the experiencedone full flexibility.The most visible difference between patent and nonpatent literature was observed in the application of NLP methods. The studiesmentioned in this section indicate that the nature of the genre usingmany common words, but in new combinations, together with relatively many hapax terms is a probable cause of the perceived reducedeffectiveness of both bagofwords and distributional semantics methods, when compared with results on web or newswire corpora. Suchlinguistic studies are unfortunately rather sparse, as they require a significant amount of manual annotation and text analysis, together withpotentially large computational resources.In fact, an issue that was not directly addressed in this section isthat of scalability. The global set of patent documents is large. Estimates for the total number of patent documents available worldwideare difficult to make, but commercial collections claiming worldwidecoverage range in the area of 7090 million documents.29 This is notlarger than the web collections that the IR community is currently handling, and scalability becomes a particular issue here only insofar as themethod at hand is running significantly more complex algorithms thanthose of standard IR. For instance, Klampanos et al. 103 and Urbainand Frieder 193 propose distributed systems in order to manage morecomplex processing probabilistic logic in the first case, and chemicalinformation extraction in the second. These are problems that are notspecific to the patent domain and which receive a well deserved largeshare of attention in the community.29Precise numbers are not available, and these are estimates we obtained in private conversations.4MetadataOne of the main characteristics of patent search is the availability of arich metadata, created in the granting process by both the applicantsand the examiners. We start with a description of this metadata, andof the uses one can make of it for retrieval. We then continue with abrief survey of technologies which assist in creating additional metadata, such as classification and information extraction. We concludethis section with a section on visualizations for patent retrieval.4.1 Existing MetadataIn Section 3, and particularly in Section 3.2 on patent document processing, we have presented a number of systems that use various IRmodels to calculate similarities between queries and documents. Wehave carefully avoided however discussing those enhancements whichuse metadata in this process. We come back to this now and start byshowing in Table 4.1 a list of common fields generally present in allpatent documents. This kind of information is generally not present ingeneral purpose IR collections, and has been indicated by patent searchprofessionals to be very useful in patent retrieval.484.1 Existing Metadata 49Table 4.1. Metadata generally associated with a patent document.Field ExplanationID Unique, global identifierFamily ID An identifier for the family to which the current documentbelongsPublication Number Potentially the same as the ID, unless the emitting authorityhas a different practicePublication Date Date when the present document was made publicApplication Number Many authorities assign a number upon receiving a patentapplication, and another number to the published documentdescribing that applicationApplication Date The date when the application was receivedPriority One or more patent IDs indicating prior applications for thisinvention, according to the Paris ConventionEarliest Priority Date Earliest application date of the set aboveIPC International Patent Classification LabelECLAFtermsother Other classifications, as assigned by national patent officesTitle Language Language of the titlePatent Citations List of patent IDs cited by the applicant, examiner or in anopposition procedure, in relation to the current documentNonPatent Citations As above, but for nonpatent literatureApplicant Name Name of the individual or company that applied for the patentAssignee Name Name of individualcompany owning the patentInventor Name Name of the individuals who invented the object or processdisclosedAgent Name Name of the individual or company acting on behalf of theaboveAbstract Language Language in the abstractDescription Language Language in the descriptionClaims Language Language in the claimsA very simple way to increase effectiveness in the case of Noveltyor Validity searches is to make sure that, unless the collection alreadyrestricts the date range we are searching on, we do it ourselves 215.For validity search in particular, considerable attention must be paid towhen the potentially invalidating document was published. Any document, regardless of its topical relevance, will be irrelevant if madepublic after the earliest priority date of the patent whose validity weare now verifying.50 MetadataOne of the most complex, but also most useful, metadata are theclassification fields IPC, ECLA, etc.. These are covered in more detailin the next section.4.2 ClassificationPatents are classified by the patent offices into large hierarchical classification schemes based on their area of technology. The use of patentclassification has two major benefits 6. The first is that the classifications provide access to concepts rather than words, such that evenif the same word or phrase is commonly used in two technology areas,patent classifications will provide the context of its use. In effect, theyallow the search space of patents to be reduced, by allowing the userto exclude from the search process patents in classes not related tothe search topic at hand. The second major benefit is the languageindependence provided by classifications, as classification symbols canbe mapped to multiple languages. This allows patent searchers to conduct reasonably effective retrieval even in languages that they do notunderstand. At present, a large amount of the patent classification inpatent offices is done manually, although due to the ever increasingnumbers of applications, the use of automated systems is becomingmore attractive.A patent classification scheme must be able to classify the wholebody of technological knowledge. As the technological knowledge ofthe world is continuously developing and expanding, a classificationscheme must also be able to include devices or ideas that did not existwhen it was created. Furthermore, patent classification schemes areperiodically revised to take the changes to technological knowledge intoaccount. The changes can involve both creating new categories as wellas fusing categories that have received little use.At present, a number of patent classification schemes are in use.The International Patent Classification30 IPC is a hierarchical patentclassification system maintained by the WIPO. This scheme will bedescribed in more detail, as it is widely used and also forms the basis of30httpwww.wipo.intclassificationsipcen4.2 Classification 51other patent classification schemes. Other patent classification schemeswill then be briefly described.4.2.1 International Patent ClassificationAt the top level, the IPC has 8 Sections indicated by the letters Ato H, shown in Table 4.2. The names of the remaining four levels ofthe IPC hierarchy are shown on the left of Table 4.3, along with thetotal number of categories at each level. An example of a path downthe hierarchy, along with the symbols used to represent the path, isshown on the right of the table.Many of the categories also have notes guiding the classification,specifying exactly what is covered and what is not covered by thecategory. For example, subclass G04G electronic timepieces has thenote This subclass does not cover electronic timepieces with movingTable 4.2. The eight IPC sections.Section DescriptionA Human necessitiesB Performing operations TransportingC Chemistry MetallurgyD TextilesE Fixed constructionsF Mechanical engineering Lighting, Heating,Weapons, BlastingG PhysicsH ElectricityTable 4.3. The five levels in the IPC hierarchy, with the total number of categories ineach level in the second column. On the right of the double line is a specific exampleof the codes and corresponding titles for a single path down the hierarchy.No. of ExampleLevel categories symbol Example titleSection 8 G PhysicsClass 129 G04 HorologySubclass 631 G04D Apparatus or tools specifically designed formaking or maintaining clocks or watchesMain group 7392 G04D 300 Watchmakers or watchrepairers machinesor tools for working materialsSubgroup 62493 G04D 304 Devices for placing bearing jewels, bearingsleeves, or the like in position52 Metadataparts, which are covered by subclass G04C. Categories also have references to other categories that are related, for example, subclass G04Dshown in Table 4.3 has the references machine tools in general B23,B24 hand tools in general B25.The IPC also provides categories to take into account the possibilityof emerging technology not covered by any of the existing categories.For example, G04D 9900 is Subject matter not provided for in othergroups of this subclass. This provides a challenge for automated classification algorithms, as these categories are defined not by positiveexamples of their members, but by documents that do not fit intoother categories.The IPC is periodically revised. The first edition of the IPC cameinto force in 1968. Until 2005, it was revised every five years, but therevisions are now taking place more often.4.2.2 Other Patent Classification SchemesThe European Classification system ECLA is built on top of the IPCit is identical down to the main group level and maintained by theEPO. The ECLA contains around twice as many categories as the IPCaround 140,000 at main group and subgroup level, and hence hasnarrower categories allowing more finegrained classification. The fileindex FI used by the JPO is also an extension of the IPC, having atotal of 170,000 categories 168. The Fterms classification, also usedby the JPO, is a completely independent classification system and isused in addition to the IPC and FI classifications. It allows documentsto be classified from a number of technical viewpoints by assigningterm codes to them 168. A document to be classified is first assigneda theme, of which there are over 2,500, each of which is mapped toa set of FI codes. Each theme has a defined collection of viewpointsfor specifying possible aspects of the inventions under the theme e.g.,material, operation, product, purpose, etc., and each viewpoint has alist of possible elements that can be assigned to it. An Fterm consistsof a pair of a viewpoint and its element 91.The United States Patent Classification USPC system maintainedby the USPTO is an exception in that it is not based on the IPC.4.2 Classification 53Adams 6 has pointed out that even though both EPO and USPTOpatents are also classified into IPC categories, there can be significantdifferences in the IPC categories assigned to an EPO patent and itsUSPTO equivalent. This is because USPTO patents are first classified by the USPC system, and then automatically assigned to IPCcategories by a mapping between the systems, which most likely hasshortcomings. However, a recent initiative of the EPO and USPTO tocreate a common classification system for technical documents resultedin the Cooperative Patent Classification31 CPC. The CPC is basedon the ECLA, containing more than 200,000 categories. It has beenunder development since October 2010, and was officially launched onJanuary 2, 2013. From January 2015, it is planned to be the only classification scheme used by both patent offices.4.2.3 Uses for Automated Patent ClassificationAutomated patent classification in patent offices may reduce the workload of human classifiers. Due to the nature of the patent field e.g.,extensive use of neologisms, rapid technological development, complexdefinitions of some classes, fully automating the classification is a challenge. There are however many opportunities to support the manualclassification 29, 178. For instance, preclassification is the task of distributing the incoming patent applications among the various possiblegroups of examiners based on their contents, which could be seen as aclassification at class level of the IPC. This task has a high potentialfor success, as the number of classes is on the order of 100, and errorsin the initial routing can be caught at the more detailed classificationdone manually at the next step. In interactive classification, the systemproposes classes to the examiner and then allows the examiner to refinethe classification. An example of such a system is the IPCCAT32 provided by the WIPO. A third application for patent offices is in the reclassification of patent documents. After the periodic reorganizationsof the patent classification schemes, all patents in the database of apatent office must be reclassified using the new scheme. This task31httpwww.cooperativepatentclassification.org32httpswww3.wipo.intipccat54 Metadatais currently done manually, and can require a long time to complete,making it attractive for automated assistance in the classification.Classification codes are usually applied to patent documents at twolevels. Earlier, this was usually in the form of a single code for themain classification the main area to which the invention belongs,and potentially some codes for the other classifications or secondaryclassifications, relating to other aspects expressed in the patent 14,53. Furthermore, earlier IPC classifications were done based mainly onthe claims of the patent document 205. With the reform of the IPCin January 2006, it is recommended to classify additionally based oninventive aspects found in the description, examples, or drawings. Thesefeatures are classified with one or more codes referred to as inventioninformation, superseding the single IPC code of themain classification.Other content of documents, which is of lesser importance but still hassearch value, can be classified as additional information 205.A final promising application is automated classification of nonpatent documents into a patent classification scheme. These documents,including scientific literature and even web pages, should also be takeninto account in prior art searches. Their lack of classification into theschemes used by the patent offices makes it cumbersome for professionalusers to narrow down the search space. Automated classification ofthese documents could lead to more effective retrieval of nonpatentprior art by patent examiners.4.3 Generating MetadataIn addition to the metadata already associated with a document, thereis ample space to automatically create new metadata, correct existingmetadata, or to assist the user in associating metadata to a particulardocument. Automated patent classification is the area of metadata generation that has received the most attention, due to the importance ofthe applications it has in patent offices and among patent searchers, asdescribed in the previous section. Therefore, we focus now on textbasedpatent classification. We will then continue in Section 4.3.2 with a discussion of information extraction technologies for populating ontologiesspecific to the patent domain.4.3 Generating Metadata 554.3.1 Textbased Patent ClassificationPatent document classification is challenging for the following reasons1 there is a large imbalance in the distribution of documents in categories, as the number of inventions varies in different parts of thetaxonomy 2 most patents are assigned to multiple categories  amulticlassification task and 3 the codes are assigned at two levels ofimportance  primary categories and secondary categories.In 19992000, the EPO carried out tests for preclassification ofpatents. They provided data to research groups and companies for testing their classification systems. The summary report of these tests 213does not give a comparison of the systems participating but names someof them 87, 107.In 2002, the WIPO made publicly available a dataset for trainingand testing IPC classification the WIPOalpha dataset,33 containingover 75,000 patent documents in English.34 This dataset was introduced in 53, and results for singlelabel classification into the IPCmain classification for each patent, using common approaches such asSupport Vector Machine SVM, nave Bayes and kNearest Neighbourclassifiers, were presented. This dataset was mostly used for the development of singlelabel classifiers that take the hierarchical structure ofthe class labels into account 186, with many papers focusing on thedevelopment of kernel methods for this task 39, 162, 169, 192, 200.Unfortunately, the majority of the latter papers only report experimental results on the subset of the dataset classified in Section Dof the IPC, making it unclear what the scalability of these methodsto the full dataset is. The task of multilabel classification  assigning more than a single class to a patent document  is done usingSVMs in 40, in which classification results for each IPC Section arereported individually. The only paper that considers the problem ofdifferent levels of importance of the categories in multilabel classification the preferential text classification task is 14. It begins byproposing a new metric for evaluating preferential text classification,33httpwww.wipo.intclassificationsipcenITsupportCategorizationdataset34The WIPOde dataset, available on the same webpage, contains over 110,000 patentdocuments in German.56 Metadataformulates baseline solutions for this task in terms of well establishedclassification problems, and finally adapts the Generalized PreferenceLearning Model 13, 15 to the task. Experiments on the WIPOalphadataset for preferential classification at subclass level show the advantage of explicitly modeling the primary categories as being in competition with the secondary categories. A study focusing on the scalabilityof the SVM and Balanced Winnow classification algorithms on a corpusof 1.2 million patent applications is presented in 30.In recent years, IR evaluation campaigns have organized patentclassification evaluation tasks. Such a task was first introduced in theNTCIR5 with the task of classifying patents by Fterms 91, with twosubtasks the first subtask was to classify the patent into a theme andthe second to classify a patent for which the theme has been providedusing Fterms. The Fterm subtask was run again in the NTCIR6 90,with the same training data but different test data. The classificationof a patent by Fterm given a theme is more difficult than the classification by theme  the highest MAP for classification by theme inNTCIR5 was 0.69, obtained using a kNearest Neighbour kNN classifier. The highest MAP for classification by Fterms for exact matchto the Fterms in NTCIR5 was 0.50 obtained by a kNN classifier, andin NTCIR6 was 0.49 obtained by a group of nave Bayes models.The NTCIR7 campaign investigated a crossgenre classificationtask the classification of research publications into the IPC, basedon training with patent data. This task continued in NTCIR8 146.English and Japanese patent data were provided for training, and testswere done on both English and Japanese research papers. Both monolingual same training and test language and crosslingual classification evaluation was done. In NTCIR7, only classification at subgrouplevel was evaluated, while in NTCIR8, classification at three levels wasevaluated. The best Japanese monolingual runs in NTCIR8 had thefollowing MAP values 0.80 at subclass level, 0.64 at main group level,and 0.45 at subgroup level. All were obtained using various refinementsof the kNN algorithm, including the additional use of a learning to rankalgorithm.The 2010 CLEFIP track included a new task on patent classification 158, which was run again in 2011 157. In these tasks, over4.3 Generating Metadata 571 million patents were provided as training data. The aim was to classifypatent documents in the test set at IPC subclass level. The results fromthe 2011 task show that systems are able to assign a single subclass toa patent effectively, with the best runs, obtained using the Winnowclassifier, having a precision1 of between 0.82 and 0.85. A recall5of over 0.85 was also obtained, but with a correspondingly low precision5 of around 0.55. A second classification task added in 2011 issimilar to the Fterm classification task in the NTCIR5 and 6  giventhe IPC subclass for a patent, return the groupsubgroup classifications. Unfortunately only one group participated in this task, but asfor the NTCIR task, this task proved difficult, with the best run havinga precision1 of only 0.54 using a kNN approach.4.3.2 Information ExtractionIn addition to all the metadata already available in a patent corpus,there are large numbers of entities present in the text, entities which, ifidentified, assist not only the search process, but also the user in understanding the document. The process of information extraction will ofteninvolve NLP methods, some of which were presented in Section 3.2.3,but is not limited to them.The domain of patents, as mentioned in the Introduction, coversmany technological domains, each of which has, presumably, its owncomplex ontological system. A general approach can be taken, usinggazetteers, rulebased systems or machine learning, to extract a common denominator consisting of measures and units, places and names ofpeople, publication venues or organizations 12. Such information canthen be integrated into a complex retrieval system to allow retrieval onboth the full text and the semantic data 46.A deeper focus on specific domains is likely to be more useful, particularly since companies, as well as individual users of a patent searchsystem, are also specialized on one or a small number of technologyareas.For most domains there are only few publications targeting thepatents for information extraction. There is more work in scientific publications, which provide useful methods to create semantic data from58 Metadatafulltext. In some domains there is a lot more explicit semantics thanin others. For instance, in the biomedical and healthcare domain, thereare a number of works using the data available from PubMed Centralor Medline 44, 143. The lessons learned from these studies, such as linguistic patterns predominantly used in these domains, can be applied,in particular contexts, to the patent domain 108. We will discuss moreabout biochemical information extraction methods in Section 5.4 in thecontext of nontextual information.All the information extracted from the text, in combination withthe existing metadata, can be put together to create a patent domainspecific ontology, such as the one attempted in the PatExpert project.35The PatExpert ontology represents both the explicit metadata alreadypresented in the previous sections, as well as any other data that couldbe extracted directly from the text, or assigned to specific entities viaa classifier, or, more generally, a machine learning method 65, 66.Taduri et al. build on this work, but opt for a simpler ontology, whichcan be used to map several sources of domain knowledge 179, 180, 181.However, the adoption in practice of these methods and tools is stillunclear.4.4 The Use of MetadataWhether manually or automatically created or a combination thereof,the metadata can be used inside the retrieval process in addition tobeing available to the user for navigation. Here, we review such uses,as described in the literature.4.4.1 The Use of CitationsThe most successful use of metadata to date is that of the citation listsin order to learn patterns of relevance. This was used for the first timeby Fujii in the context of the NTCIR6 55. Fujii used the citationnetwork as a voting mechanism similar to PageRank and showed moderate, but significant improvements in comparison with textonly basedretrieval. Lopez and Romary in the 2009 CLEFIP campaign 121 also35httpwww.patexpert.org4.4 The Use of Metadata 59used the citations and achieved a vastly superior effectiveness scorecompared with all other methods. The proposed system, PATATRAS,is however much more complex than just using the citations and yetagain it is difficult to distinguish where exactly the significant performance boost comes from. Given that other components had been usedbefore or concurrently in other systems, it is reasonable to assume thatthe use of citations had a positive effect in this case as well. As a consequence of these results, the use of citations has been adopted by othergroups as well, with similarly positive results 68, 72.The method was further enhanced in the following year 120 with,among others, a machine learning method to expand the list of citationsexplicitly mentioned as metadata, with citations occurring in the textof the patent application itself 119.The use of citations in the retrieval process may be disputed, andit has been in the various fora where these methods were presented,because the evaluation of the system also uses citations as relevancejudgments. Of course, these relevance judgments were not part of thetraining set for any of the systems, and in our view the use of citationsfor system training or result reranking is valid scientific practice aslong as care is taken not to mix the training set with the evaluation setinadvertently, via long citation chains.4.4.2 The Use of ClassificationsAnother component that was a part of the PATATRAS system 121, aswell as of many others, was the use of classification codes. The principleis very simple and goes back again to the multitude of subdomainswithin the patent domain it is perhaps not useful to search for priorart to an aquatic toy US Patent 3113517 among the chemical patents.Then again, this intuition is not always true. Perhaps the aquatic toyjust mentioned was floating because of a particular material it wasmade of and which might therefore have prior art in chemistry.The use of IPC codes can be particularly useful in the case of amultilingual collection, since the codes themselves are language independent 50. A similar observation was made by several other participants in the CLEFIP campaign 61, 69, 83, 98, 199. In general,60 Metadatathe participants use the IPC annotations, as they are the only setthat is common across different patenting authorities, but Harris et al.investigated the different utility of the IPC, USPC, and ECLA systems 79, 80, 81. The observations made indicate that the IPC is infact less useful for retrieval than the other classifications. This is, inhindsight, expected, since the IPC is designed for uniformity acrossdifferent patenting authorities and practice, while the national classifications are designed for retrieval.4.5 VisualizationsVisualization of complex data is a general problem, not particularlyspecific to the patent domain. That being said, the patent domain hasoften used it, in combination with text mining, particularly in the fieldof business analytics 38, 42, 175, 203. Such visualization tools canbe divided into patent graphs that use structured data, such as themetadata described earlier, and patent maps that use unstructured textdata 190.Some patent graph examples are shown in Figures 4.1 to 4.3, kindlyprovided by MCAM Inc. Figure 4.1 shows a visual tracking of theFig. 4.1 Cited and citing patents, grouped by applicant.4.5 Visualizations 61citation relationships between cited prior art, the subject patent andsubsequent cited art. Figure 4.2 depicts the prosecution history of theissued patents examined in the context of the subject patent. The barsat the bottom of the graphic use unstructured data to display the innovation space around the subject patent, which was not cited by theapplicant or examiner. Finally, Figure 4.3 provides a geographic visualization of a patents family data allowing comparison across countryinformation.Fig. 4.2 The prior and current art of a patent, including cited documents.Fig. 4.3 A global view of the patent family.62 MetadataAn example of patent maps are the selforganizing maps usedin 109 to assist the user in the analysis of a patent collection. Ingeneral however, a professional user is likely to take advantage of bothgraphs and maps 67, 105.There are however many more tools for visualization in the commercial space, to which we have little access, and even fewer possibilities to evaluate. A sample of these tools is described and evaluated byprofessional users in 212. Their conclusions are sometimes surprising,as they are extremely practical and have little to say about the coreeffectiveness of any method. The perceived strengths are phrased in afairly general way e.g., Sophisticated semantic analysis or Patentmapping, clustering and citation analysis while the potential limitations obviously come from practical needs and constraints e.g.,Requires inhouse training high cost or Difficult to understandThemescape labels. This again illustrates the gap between the understanding of evaluation in the IR and IP communities, as discussed inthe introduction to Section 2.4.6 SummaryThe patent domain compensates its use of complex texts with the presence of extensive metadata. Searches in patent collections were donewell before modern Information Retrieval established itself, and a consequence of this is the existence of detailed information about whoinvented, wrote or owns the intellectual property described, when protection was sought, as well as what other similar disclosures exist bethey patent or nonpatent literature and the kind of technology itdescribes. All this information has been shown to help increase theeffectiveness of the search methods, and in some cases it is vital.In addition to content specific knowledge representations, recentworks attempt to model the patent domain itself the documents, theauthors and other parties involved, the different dates and priorities,etc. as an ontology on which to build data exploration tools. Amongthese tools, visualization methods assist the user in tasks where thesearch target is not necessarily very clearly defined e.g., patent landscape search.4.6 Summary 63Automated classification of patents has a number of importantpractical applications, and is of immense interest to patent offices asa means of increasing efficiency in the face of a mounting number ofpatent applications. Automated classification at levels of the classification hierarchies with fewer classes e.g., IPC subclass has acceptable performance, but automated classification at the levels with morenumerous classes e.g., IPC groupsubgroup is still a challenge. Theadoption by the EPO and USPTO of the CPC, with over 200,000 categories, makes the classification task even more challenging.Results from the NTCIR and CLEF evaluation campaigns show thatsimpler classification algorithms kNN and Winnow produce the bestresults. These algorithms are also suitable as they can be easily appliedto large amounts of data. The kNN approach can be implemented byindexing and retrieving similar patents from the training data, whilethe Winnow approach has a very simple model. The main disadvantageof a more complex model such as an SVM is that it requires more timefor training 30, 198 and hence does not scale well with the size of thedata. None of the evaluation campaigns have yet evaluated the taskof classifying a patent into primary and secondary classes preferential classification  it would be interesting to test the scalability ofpreferential classification algorithms to large amounts of data and withmany classes.5Beyond TextThe majority of the work on patent retrieval has focused on thetext and metadata of the patent. However, patents also contain nontextual information in the form of images, or, as they are referred toin the patent domain, drawings. The USPTO Nonprovisional Utility Patent Application Filing Guide36 makes the following statement,strongly encouraging applicants to include drawingsA patent application is required to contain drawings,if drawings are necessary to understand the subjectmatter to be patented. Most patent applications containdrawings. The drawings must show every feature of theinvention as specified in the claims. Omission of drawings may cause an application to be considered incomplete and no application filing date will be granted bythe USPTO.In some cases, key information may be only in the drawingsand not in the text. For example, in mechanical gearing and power36httpwww.uspto.govpatentsresourcestypesutility.jsp645.1 Characteristics of Drawings in Patents 65transmissions, inventions often involve the relative orientation of various known parts, and the information is typically conveyed by referenceto drawings 178. This underlines the importance of the drawing content in the information contained in the patent, although this contenthas largely been ignored in patent IR systems.Chemical structures can be represented in multiple ways in a patent,including a number of methods of encoding them in text as well asin drawings. To assist in searching, it is essential that these variousrepresentations are converted to comparable chemical entities.After an introduction to the characteristics of drawings in patents,we review the work that has been done in patent drawing retrieval,patent drawing classification and the retrieval of chemical structures.5.1 Characteristics of Drawings in PatentsDrawings in patents are usually in black and white, as patent officesoften make the submission of color drawings a more complex process.The USPTO, for example, requires an explanation of why the colordrawings are necessary and the payment of an additional fee.Patents contain different types of figures. The patent drawing ontology created by Vrochidis et al. 201, shown in Figure 5.1, specifies thefive classes of figure that occur in patents photo, diagram including block, state, and circuit diagrams, flowchart, technical drawing,and graph. For the CLEFIP 2011 patent image classification task,nine classes of patent image were identified by analyzing the MARECFigurePhoto DiagramBlockDiagram State CircuitFlowchart TechnicalDrawingPlaneView SideViewBottomView TopViewElevationalView SectionalViewGraphWaveformResponse TimeChartFig. 5.1 Patent Drawing Ontology from 201.66 Beyond Textdataset abstract drawing, graph, flowchart, gene sequence, programlisting, symbol, chemical structure, table, and mathematics. Examples of these are shown in Figure 5.2. Drawings in older patents areoften done by hand, although the increasing use of computerized drawing packages is leading to more homogeneous drawing styles in morerecent patent applications. In electronic versions of older patents, thequality of the drawings is usually poor, due to the less advanced scanning techniques available when they were scanned. Even in more recentpatents that have been submitted electronically, workflows in somepatent offices lead to a loss of the vectorized images and their replacement by bitmap images.There is a strong association between patent drawings and patenttext. As in the majority of technical documents, drawings are numberedconsecutively and referred to as FIG. x in the text note that tablesare usually also considered to be drawings. However, the figure numberindication is usually part of the drawing, so the relation is not alwayssimple to extract automatically due to the widely varying fonts usedin the drawings, as demonstrated in the examples in Figure 5.3. Somepatents also contain a section headed Brief Description of the Drawing ,which contains the brief captions of the drawings, for example, FIG. 2is a partial view of a cutting head assembly. Further linking betweendrawings and text is provided by part numbers. These part numbersare referenced in the text  applicants are discouraged by the patentapplication guidelines from including words in the drawing in the caseof the EPO, this is to allow the straightforward reuse of drawings intranslated versions of the patent. For example, for the drawing in thetop row of Figure 5.2, the first part of the corresponding passage fromthe description isAs FIG. 2 shows in detail, each membrane support plate6 comprises a frame, for example rectangular frame 14made of profiled tubes or bars. The frame 14 is, in thecase shown, mounted on a support base 15 . . .List 118 presents the current challenges faced in searching drawings in patents from a patent search professionals points of view  at5.1 Characteristics of Drawings in Patents 67Fig. 5.2 The nine classes of patent drawing used in CLEFIP 2011.68 Beyond TextFig. 5.3 A collage of drawing identification labels from patent drawings from 75.present the majority of drawingbased search is done by manual visualcomparison of the drawings. Adams 7 describes the crucial role thatnontextual information plays in patents. He points out that physicalscale models were required to be submitted with early US patents, andthat the complexity of many inventions is poorly captured by the stackof black and white crosssection drawings on paper required today.He argues that it would make sense for patent offices to accept electronic 3D models and other electronic supplementary material to makethe invention disclosures more intelligible and hence make the patentsearching process more effective. Areas in which the submission of 3Dstructural data is useful include mechanical devices, chemistry, andbiology. Many patent offices already accept or are considering accepting 3D ComputerAided Design CAD models and structural modelswith patent applications 194.5.2 Computeraided Patent Drawing RetrievalThe search for similar patent drawings is mostly based on references andthe text in the captions. Some work has been done on automaticallylinking text in drawings e.g., figure numbers to paragraphs in thepatent text 114, 130 to make it easier for a reader to switch betweendrawings and their descriptive text.As described above, patent drawings are in general binary. Themajority of work done on image similarity retrieval focuses on5.2 Computeraided Patent Drawing Retrieval 69photographs, and uses features such as color and texture 48, 177,which are not applicable to patent drawings in a useful way. Nevertheless, the classic ContentBased Image Retrieval CBIR approachis usually adopted for drawing retrieval systems for patents a featurerepresentation is chosen and this is applied to calculate the distancebetween all drawings in a patent database, irrespective of the type ofdrawing.Some early work focused on developing feature representations specific to binary drawings in patents 86, 187. This early work was however only tested on small datasets of around 200 drawings. More recentwork on drawing search in patents has been done in the PatExpert37project 204, in which the PatMedia38 system was developed 174, 201.A new hierarchical feature representation for the patent drawings wasdeveloped and shown to perform well on a dataset of 2,000 patent drawings, outperforming three earlier methods for binary image retrieval219, 137, 210. The PatViz system for applying visual analytics topatent search makes use of the PatMedia system for image similaritycalculation 105.Beyond binary drawings, approaches have been described specifically aimed at design patents 217 and at flower patents 47. Thelatter patents covering new families or subfamilies of flowers is anarea in the patent domain to which common color and texturebasedimage retrieval approaches are applicable due to the use of color photosof flowers.A drawback of all published papers on patent drawing retrieval isthe relative small scale of their experiments, not representative of thehuge number of drawings that need to be searched through in the patentdomain. In 2011, for the first time, a patent drawing retrieval taskwas offered in CLEFIP 157. A total of 23,444 patent documents inXML format from three IPC subclasses were provided to participantstogether with their 291,566 image files i.e., an average of 12.5 imagesper patent. The three IPC subclasses were chosen to limit the set ofdrawings to a reasonable number, and were chosen based on input from37httpwww.patexpert.org38httpmklabservices.iti.grpatmedia70 Beyond Textpatent searchers as to which classes often require visual comparison ofdrawings to locate prior art. Participants had the choice of using eithervisual information, textual information or combined visual and textualinformation in the retrieval experiments. As queries, 211 patents alongwith their drawings were provided. The common CLEFIP approachof creating relevance judgments based on citations was followed. Unfortunately only one group, Xerox Research Centre Europe, participated45. As feature representation for the patent drawings, they used theFisher vector representation 155. Experiments were done using imagefeatures only, text features only, and a combination of text and imagefeatures. As is to be expected, the performance of the retrieval usingonly image features was poor, giving a best MAP of 0.035. The textonly runs significantly outperformed the imageonly retrieval, producing a best MAP of 0.203. The fusion of the text and image runs with alate fusion approach did result in an improved MAP of 0.212, demonstrating the usefulness of including visual information in the rankingdetermination.5.3 Image ClassificationFor the work on patent drawing retrieval presented above, a globalimage feature representation was chosen for all drawings. However, asalready mentioned in Section 5.1, patents contain different classes ofdrawings with different characteristics. It was pointed out in 75 thata large amount of work on the classes of drawings found in patentshas been done on technical documents in general. This includes workon technical drawings 188, 2D plots 123, and charts 218. A moredetailed review of the approaches applied to these drawing types is in31. A promising approach to improve drawing retrieval in patents isto adapt the analysis and matching to each class of patent drawing,for example compare flowcharts to each other with a similarity metricdesigned for flowcharts.In order to accomplish this, it is necessary to classify each patentimage by type. Vrochidis et al. 201 do such a classification based on thetext in the drawing captions, but the caption does not always containthe name of the image class. In order to evaluate the classification5.4 Chemical Structure in Patents 71of patent drawings into classes based on visual information, an imageclassification task was organized in CLEFIP 2011 157. The task wasto classify images into the nine classes depicted in Figure 5.2 using onlyvisual information. As training data, 38,087 images preclassified intothe nine classes were provided. 1,000 images were later released as testdata. Two groups participated 45, 142, with the best true positiveclassification rate obtained being 91. This was obtained by makinguse of the Fisher vector representation mentioned above followed by alinear classifier.5.4 Chemical Structure in PatentsChemical patents, which are of key importance to the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries, have to contain information about thechemical molecules of interest. This information can be represented in anumber of formats. Formats that can be represented by text include themolecule name, SMILES Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification, InChI International Chemical Identifier, and a connectiontable. The structure can also be represented in an image, as shown inthe second row of Figure 5.2 84. Chemical structures are made up ofa limited set of symbols, reducing their variability. Therefore, while itis still challenging to interpret these structures, it is simpler than interpreting a mechanical drawing, or even a plot, in which there is muchmore flexibility as to the objects depicted 75.Recently, the extraction of chemical structures from images inpatents has attracted particular interest 54, 195. To evaluate howwell chemical structure information can be extracted from images, anImagetoStructure task was organized in TRECCHEM 2011 126.Overall, all participants correctly recognized over 60 of the structureimages, with the best runs recognizing over 90.The difficulty in interpreting chemical structures lies more in mapping the discovered structure to known compounds, or to other, similar representations of the same compound. These techniques are animportant component of chemoinformatics which is concerned withthe application of computational methods to tackle chemical problems,with particular emphasis on the manipulation of chemical structure72 Beyond Textinformation 111. This process can be assisted by information presentin the text. In fact, the chemical domain is to a large extent a privilegeddomain in terms of the resources that patent searchers have at theirdisposal. The advantage of searchers in this domain is the long historyand practice of chemical retrieval. The importance of chemistry in allaspects of human life led to the appearance, over 50 years ago, of amanually created index, which is now part of the Chemical AbstractsService CAS.39 Efforts on making this process automatic have alsobeen extensive 99.More recently, Klinger and his colleagues at Fraunhofer SCAIexplored the detection of chemical formulae in text using ConditionalRandom Fields CRF 104, and then the same research group usedit successfully in the TRECCHEM campaign 71, 72, 73. The resultsshow that using the chemical entities in the retrieval process alwaysimproves results. They do not say, however, what was the effectivenessof the entity recognition process. We may assume that it was similar tothe one on scientific articles, since that study 104 briefly mentioned asmaller test on a handselected collection of patents. But even Klingerand his colleagues were surprised at the apparent small loss in F1 values, given that scientific articles and patents still present some considerable distinctions in terms of presence of chemical and biomedicalentities 144.As Klinger before, Grego et al. 70 use CRF on a patent collectionconsisting of European patents, with manual annotations as the goldstandard. They also use Oscar3, a general purpose chemical information extraction engine developed in the Peter MurrayRust group inCambridge.40 They show lower F1 scores than Klinger, to some extentconfirming our expectation that the patent corpus is more difficult. Thecomparison cannot be made conclusively, since they looked for partiallydifferent forms of entities Klinger et al. looked exclusively at IUPACnames, while Grego et al. at more general chemical entities, and theyhave slightly different definitions of what a match is particularly withrespect to partial matches.39httpwww.cas.org40httpwwwpmr.ch.cam.ac.ukwikiOscar35.5 Summary 73The systems presented so far do not approach the patent collectionany differently from the scientific articles. Some finetuning of thesemethods may be needed for the patent domain, but the difference liesmainly after the entity recognition phase, in the search and use of thesofound entities. Chemical patent search requires the system to allowfor partial structures in the queries. This is for two reasons First,because patents, in their desire to cover as many structures as possible,use a form of regular expressions for the patent domain  Markushstructures 25, 26  to represent possibly infinite sets of chemicalformulae. Second, because innovation is never totally new, especiallyin a field as old as chemistry, and therefore there may always be a set ofsubstructures that would be easy to combine to invalidate the noveltyof a new structure. An excellent overview of these issues has recentlybeen written by Holliday and Willet 84.5.5 SummaryThe use of nontext information in patent IR has received relativelylittle attention. Image retrieval systems that have been developed forpatents have tended to process each drawing in the same way, regardlessof its content. A promising route to improving patent drawing retrievalis to make use of the work that has been done on figure analysis andretrieval for specific types of figures in technical documents. This willrequire that a preclassification by type of the patent drawings be done,but good results in the CLEFIP 2011 drawing classification task haveshown that this is feasible. As this task used only visual features fromthe drawings, adding text from the drawing captions has the potentialto improve the drawing type classification further. For drawings such ascircuit diagrams, chemical structures and flowcharts, which are built ona limited vocabulary of symbols, automatically extracting the meaning of the drawing is feasible. However, in many cases, it is extremelydifficult to automatically extract the complex semantic concepts represented from the abstract drawings available as 2bit depth bitmaps inpatents.In the chemical domain, advantage can be taken of the large amountof work done in the area of cheminformatics. However, beyond the74 Beyond Textgeneral problems of chemical information processing and retrieval,the patent domain introduces here a form of regular expressions Markush structures  designed to cover many potentially infinitecompounds with similar functionality. Calculating similarity based onthese structures can be a computationally expensive task.Until now, the separate modalities in the patents have generallybeen retrieved separately. For example, individual images are retrievedfrom multiple patents based only on image similarity. Taking both information about text and images into account by modality fusion in theretrieval has produced promising results in the CLEFIP 2011 evaluation. There remains much research to be done on multimodal retrievalof patents. In particular, a representation for all of the modalities ofa patent that would allow similarity to be calculated at patent levelshould be developed. The importance of the various modalities in calculating patent similarity and how this changes with respect to queryand search type should also be investigated.The potentially increasing use of digital 3D models in patents willrequire the use of methods for retrieving such models based on theircontent. A recent survey of these methods is available in 184.6ConclusionsThis survey serves two purposes. First, it reviews the work alreadydone in the field of patent IR. Second, it introduces the specificitiesand peculiarities of this domain to IR researchers looking for a newchallenge for their methods and algorithms.We have covered as much as possible of the research focused onpatent data, and provided the reader with a reference guide for the different aspects of this domain. We have naturally focused on InformationRetrieval issues, but touched on other aspects related to informationmanagement, such as classification, information extraction, and visualization. We did not cover business aspects of patent research, such asthose aiming to evaluate patents and patent portfolios.In the end, we observe, without surprise, that systems that performwell on general IR test data also perform well on patent data, in relativeterms. In absolute values, they all perform apparently less well on thepatent data. Such values cannot be directly compared, but practice andthe experience of professional searchers corroborate such a tentativeconclusion. The lower effectiveness figures are, on the one hand, theresult of the genre and domain of patent documents. On the other hand,they are also a result of the very specific use cases on which they are7576 Conclusionsevaluated. In practice, several other factors than topical relevance areconsidered, particularly in such specific searches as validity or patentlandscape search.For such use cases, a combination of metadata analysis, informationextraction and ontologies including classifications are used to boosteffectiveness scores. Such explicit semantic methods are particularlyinteresting because they have the potential to assist the user in evaluating the risk present in each search, in a similar way to what Booleansearch is now doing i.e., providing visible proof of why a documenthas been retrieved. While evaluation campaigns are excellent at predicting average performance of many queries, the patent professionalneeds guarantees on each individual search result, and often the bestguarantee is an understanding of the limits of the search system.The case of image search and processing for the patent domain isparticularly difficult. While for text there are a number of options thathave been explored and which show promising results, the semanticgap between the 2bit color depth abstract drawings and the complexconcepts they depict is still extremely large. Only in certain specificcases, like chemical structure images, has some progress been made.6.1 Adoption of IR TechnologiesBased on the current survey, we can see a large increase in the production of research results using patent data, and in addressing patentsearch issues. To what extent these results are adopted by the industry and incorporated in endproducts is unclear. Certainly, there areeconomic and business reasons that lead to the adoption by a certainprovider of a particular technology. There is however a more significant issue which surfaced repeatedly in our discussions with patentprofessionals the searchers professional success relies on the searchsystem. With existing systems, the searcher is, through practice andexperience, able to understand their weak points and compensate. Thisis for instance the attractiveness of Boolean search results the reasons for the presence or absence of documents in the search resultsare easy to understand, and the results can therefore be calibratedthrough professional experience. The IR engines present in academia6.2 Trends in Patent IR 77have demonstrated their performance improvements over the long termthrough averages over many queries, but are difficult to debug for anyindividual query.Another aspect which is not necessarily viewed with great enthusiasm by the professional searcher is the lack of repeatability of results.A Boolean system will return the same set of documents when thecollection changes plus or minus the documents changed. A modernIR system will return mostly the same documents, but its capacity toadapt the term weights and the similarity function makes it such thatthe result is not guaranteed to be the same. Professional searchers are,in some cases, liable for the quality of their search and they might needto show that a previous search did not produce a particular document.Modern IR systems as opposed to IR engines need to cater to thisneed as well.6.2 Trends in Patent IRWe have hinted already at interesting issues to focus on for futureresearch and development. Let us now put them in a list. They are theresult of going through the many papers covered in this review, but alsoof the many interactions we have had with patent searchers from different companies or patent offices, and of following discussions in patentsearch fora. We have tried to order the issues directly proportionalto our perception of their importance for the domain, and inverselyproportional to the amount of research already carried out, but thisis still our subjective ranking. This should not be taken to implythat further study in all of the issues mentioned in this survey is notimportant.Information Fusion. The information available in one patent document is multilingual and multimodal. The professional searcher adaptsto this situation by using several different tools or simply going manually through sets of patents to identify images of interest. Our initialattempt to encourage the combination of these two domains by proposing a task at CLEFIP 2011 157 showed that there are extremely fewresearch groups able to tackle this challenging task. More consideration of nontextual information combined with textual information is78 Conclusionstherefore needed. The general research question in this case would beIs it possible and useful to treat all of the components text, image,metadata, etc. of a patent document as a single entity in the similarity calculation, instead of, for instance, calculating similarity of singleimagesTwo refinements of this information fusion issue deserve specialmention. First, we remember from Section 5 that not all images areequal in this domain, and that similarity must take into account thespecificities of these different types if it is to be of significant use. Second, while the use of citations and other metadata is mentioned inseveral works and discussed here, it is unclear from these initial studieswhether their use has already been optimized, or if there is still spaceto optimize further.Federated Search. As opposed to the previous issue, where theresearch problem assumes availability of all data in one site, the practice of patent search often requires searching in different databases. Inmost cases, such databases cannot be merged perhaps less for technicalthan for policy or commercial reasons. There is a significant amountof work in distributed IR, but its application to the patent domain isnot very visible. Some issues which may require special attention whenadapting to this domain are the different genres of the patent documents versus the nonpatent literature and the links between thesedatabases i.e., citations from one collection to another.User Modeling. Precisely understanding the needs of the user andthe processes that heshe goes through to satisfy those needs is generally important for IR. An effort to model the patent searcher is alreadyundergoing in the context of the PROMISE project mentioned in previous sections. Based on this experience, we can say that there is stilla substantial amount of work to be done in this sense.User Interfaces and Collaborative Search. Based on the currentunderstanding of the search processes, and that which will still be developed in the future, better interfaces should be designed. The amountof work available in this sense is particularly limited, because the vastmajority of systems used by professional searchers are commercial systems, and, as discussed, their evaluation is generally done via very6.2 Trends in Patent IR 79narrow examples. An exhaustive study in this sense would be highlydesirable, to complement effectiveness evaluation campaigns such asCLEF, TREC, or NTCIR.In some cases, the interfaces must allow for several users to collaborate on a search. Particularly in cases of very high importance to acompany, it is not uncommon for an information specialist to collaborate with a domain specialist a chemist, for instance and a lawyerspecialised in a particular jurisdiction. How exactly to optimize thisprocess is largely unclear.Unit of retrival. Finally, we should not forget that patent search isalso about assisting the searcher in understanding a domain or a document. In addition to document retrieval, identifying important paragraphs within each document, as well as important concepts and theirlinks is still an issue in patent search, again due to the complexity ofthe documents to be processed.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the Information Retrieval Facility IRF, in particular JohnTait, for initiating and guiding the research on patent retrieval that hasled to a significant amount of progress in the field. We are also gratefulto our colleagues at the IRF and subsequently at the Vienna Universityof Technology for inspiring discussions and collaboration on the subjectof patent retrieval Linda Andersson, Florina Piroi, Giovanna Roda,and Mike Salampasis.We are particularly grateful for extensive information on the IPdomain and professional patent searching from Stephen Adams, RosaAlentorn, Pierre Buffet, Barrou Diallo, Carlos Faerman, Monika Hanelt,Maike Houtrouw, Frasier Kennedy, Jane List, Teresa Loughbrough,Madeleine Marley, Susan McKee, Henk Thomas, Tony Trippe, and Gerard Ypma.The work on this review has been partially funded by the followingprojects PROMISE Network of Excellence FP7258191, funded bythe European Commission IMPEx 825846, funded by the AustrianResearch Promotion Agency FFG and PLuTO ICTPSP250416,funded by the European Commission.80Notations and AcronymsANC American National CorpusBNC British National CorpusCLEF CrossLanguage Evaluation ForumCLEFIP CLEF Intellectual Property TrackCLIR CrossLanguage Information RetrievalCPC Cooperative Patent ClassificationCRF Conditional Random FieldDF Document FrequencyDLSI Differential Latent Semantic IndexingECLA European Classification SystemEPO European Patent OfficeFI File Index JPO classification schemeIDF Inverse Document FrequencyIPC International Patent ClassificationIP Intellectual PropertyIP5 The Five IP OfficesIR Information RetrievalISR International Search ReportJPO Japan Patent Office8182 Notations and AcronymsKCCA Kernel Canonical Correlation AnalysisKIPO Korean Intellectual Property OfficekNN kNearest NeighborLM Language ModelLSI Latent Semantic IndexingMAP Mean Average PrecisionMAREC Matrixware Research CollectionMRR Mean Reciprocal RanknDCG normalized Discounted Cumulative GainNII National Institute of Informatics JapanNLP Natural Language ProcessingNP Noun PhraseNTCIR NII Test Collection for IR SystemsOCR Optical Character RecognitionPM Probabilistic ModelPRF PseudoRelevance FeedbackPROMISE Participative Research labOratory forMultimedia and Multilingual InformationSystems EvaluationSIPO State Intellectual Property Office of the PeoplesRepublic of ChinaSMT Statistical Machine TranslationSVM Support Vector MachineTF Term FrequencyTREC Text Retrieval ConferenceTRECCHEM TREC Chemical IR TrackTS Technology SurveyUSPC United States Patent ClassificationUSPTO United States Patent and Trademark OfficeVSM Vector Space ModelWIPO World Intellectual Property OrganizationReferences1 The clueweb dataset, httplemurproject.orgclueweb09.phpindex.php.2 Manual of patent examination procedure, section 608.01m, Revision July2010, httpwww.uspto.govwebofficespacmpepindex.htm.3 Understanding intellectual property, httpwww.wipo.intaboutipen.4 PATENT 03 Proceedings of the ACL2003 Workshop on Patent Corpus Processing.
