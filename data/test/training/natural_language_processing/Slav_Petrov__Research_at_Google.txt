Hall Kuzman Ganchev Lukasz Kaiser Michael Collins Michael Ringgaard Oriol Vinyals Oscar TÃ¤ckstrÃ¶m Peter Norvig Pi-Chuan Chang Ryan McDonald Uri Lerner I am a researcher at Google leading teams that conduct natural language processing and machine learning research with applications to question answering, machine translation and information extraction. We recently released SyntaxNet/Parsey McParseface and his Cousins . Here is a high-level talk about my work in general. I also teach Statistical Natural Language Processing at New York University. I completed my PhD at UC Berkeley, where I worked with Dan Klein . Here is a vaguely current curriculum vitae . I grew up in Berlin, Germany, but I am originally from Sofia, Bulgaria. I therefore consider myself a Berliner from Bulgaria. Whenever Bulgaria plays Germany in soccer, I support Bulgaria. Some awards I have received: Outstanding Paper Award at ACL 2016 Meta-Net Seal of Recognition 2016 John Atanasoff Award by the President of Bulgaria 2014 Google Citizenship Award 2013 Best Paper Award at NAACL 2012 Best Paper Award at ACL 2011 World Champion at RoboCup 2004 See also my personal webpage for more information (including presentation slides).
