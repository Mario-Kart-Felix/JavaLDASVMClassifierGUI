Finding important actors, discovering cohesive groups or communities, or identifying actors that are similar in some way are all examples of analysis that can be done for social networks.   Building on its strong graph capabilities, the Wolfram Language allows you to model and analyze networks in a flexible and powerful way. Social networks are accessible from a variety of sources, including directly from social media (Facebook, Twitter, … ). High-level functions make it easy to detect communities, find cohesive groups, and visualize the results. A full suite of social network measures makes it possible to explore networks, rank actors from their centralities, or provide recommendations based on similar actors.
