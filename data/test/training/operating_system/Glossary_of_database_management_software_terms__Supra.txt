Database Management Terms   client/server ― Client/server describes the relationship between two computer programs in which one program, the client, makes a service request from another program, the server, which fulfills the request. Although the client/server idea can be used by programs within a single computer, it is a more important idea in a network. In a network, the client/server model provides a convenient way to interconnect programs that are distributed efficiently across different locations. data integration ― Data integration involves combining data residing in different sources and providing users with a unified view of these data. This process becomes significant in a variety of situations both commercial (when two similar companies need to merge their databases) and scientific (combining research results from different bioinformatics repositories, for example). Data integration appears with increasing frequency as the volume and the need to share existing data explodes. database ― A database consists of an organized collection of data for one or more uses, typically in digital form. One way of classifying databases involves the type of their contents, for example: bibliographic, document-text, statistical. Digital databases are managed using database management systems, which store database contents, allowing data creation and maintenance, and search and other access. database management system ― A Database Management System (DBMS) is a set of computer programs that controls the creation, maintenance, and the use of a database. It allows organizations to place control of database development in the hands of database administrators (DBAs) and other specialists. A DBMS is a system software package that helps the use of integrated collection of data records and files known as databases. hierarchical database ― A hierarchical database is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. The structure allows repeating information using parent/child relationships: each parent can have many children but each child only has one parent (also known as a 1:many ratio ). All attributes of a specific record are listed under an entity type. high-performance database ― Linux System z database ― Linux on System z is the collective term for the Linux operating system compiled to run on IBM mainframes, especially System z machines. Other terms with the same meaning include Linux on zEnterprise 196, Linux on System z10, Linux on System z9, Linux on zSeries, Linux/390, zLinux, z/Linux, etc. mainframe data warehouse ― A data warehouse (DW) is a database used for reporting. The data is offloaded from the operational systems for reporting. The data may pass through an Operational Data Store (ODS) for additional operations before it is used in the DW for reporting. mainframe database ― A database residing and managed on a mainframe, a large computer supporting typically 100 to 500 users at a time. The IBM 370 and IBM 3081 are examples of mainframe computers. Contrast with Minicomputer, Microcomputer, and Personal Computer (PC), all of which are much smaller than a mainframe. OpenVMS database ― A database residing and managed in the OpenVMS environment. OpenVMS (Open Virtual Memory System) is a high-end computer server operating system that runs on VAX, Alpha and Itanium-based families of computers. relational database ― A relational database matches data by using common characteristics found within the data set. The resulting groups of data are organized and are much easier for many people to understand. For example, a data set containing all the real-estate transactions in a town can be grouped by the year the transaction occurred; or it can be grouped by the sale price of the transaction; or it can be grouped by the buyer’s last name; and so on. Such a grouping uses the relational model (a technical term for this is schema). Hence, such a database is called a “relational database.” UNIX database ― A database residing and managed in the UNIX environment. UNIX is a computer operating system originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT&T employees at Bell Labs. Today’s UNIX systems are split into various branches, developed over time by AT&T as well as various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations. UNIX operating systems are widely used in servers, workstations, and mobile devices. The Unix environment and the client–server program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers. z/OS database ― A database residing and managed in the z/OS environment. z/OS is a 64-bit operating system for mainframe computers, produced by IBM. It is the successor to OS/390, which in turn followed a string of MVS versions and combined a number of formerly separate, related products. z/VSE database ― A database residing and managed in the z/VSE environment. z/VSE (Virtual Storage Extended) is an operating system for IBM mainframe computers, the latest one in the DOS/360 lineage, which originated in 1965. It is less common than prominent z/OS and is mostly used on smaller machines.   Go To Top » Home Order Products PDM Tools Success Stories Services/Support Resource Library Blog Glossary Cincom Contact Us Legal Notice Privacy Policy Terms of Use Anti-Spam Policy Subscribe ©2017 Cincom Systems Inc.
