Following a career as a trendsetting R&B/Jazz musician, James spent the next 20-years as a high-level strategist and program manager on mission critical Human Capital, ICT, Process Improvement and Organization Development initiatives at the New York Stock Exchange, Panasonic North America -- and for diverse private clients.   James holds a Ph.D. in Socio-Technical Systems from Stevens Institute of Technology. and an MBA from The Johnson School at Cornell University.   He has also completed a comprehensive profile of executive education, including programs at Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, MIT, Carnegie Mellon and Bell Labs.  Research interests include : - The intersection of Human Capital, Social Capital, Entrepreneurship, and Economic Development as a Complex Adaptive Socio Technical System - Design and Validation of large-scale Social Entrepreneurship Networks   - Development Intervention Systems Engineering - Human Capital Supply Chain - Global Diaspora Entrepreneur Networks - Strategy Formulation and Execution for the Extended Enterprise - Business Intelligence and Knowledge Management Systems - Integrated Multi-method Simulation Modeling (Agent Based, Systems Dynamic, Discreet Event)   1 References addressing the scope & substance of Enterprise Systems as a discipline: Enterprise Systems Engineering (SEBOK) Wikipedia: Enterprise Engineering Wikipedia: Enterprise Systems Engineering Wikipedia: Business Engineering   Post, J.
