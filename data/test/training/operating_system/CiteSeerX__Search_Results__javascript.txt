Abstract - Cited by 621 (36 self) - Add to MetaCart Abstract DBpedia is a community effort to extract structured informa-tion from Wikipedia and to make this information available on the Web. DBpedia allows you to ask sophisticated queries against datasets derived from Wikipedia and to link other datasets on the Web to Wikipedia data. We describe the extraction of the DBpedia datasets, and how the resulting information is published on the Web for human- and machine-consumption. We describe some emerging applications from the DBpedia community and show how website authors can facilitate DBpedia content within their sites. Finally, we present the current status of interlinking DBpedia with other open datasets on the Web and outline how DBpedia could serve as a nucleus for an emerging Web of open data. 1 Crowds: Anonymity for Web Transactions by Michael K. Reiter, Aviel D. Rubin - ACM Transactions on Information and System Security , 1997 "... this paper we introduce a system called Crowds for protecting users' anonymity on the worldwide -web.

Abstract - Cited by 835 (12 self) - Add to MetaCart this paper we introduce a system called Crowds for protecting users' anonymity on the worldwide -web. Crowds, named for the notion of "blending into a crowd", operates by grouping users into a large and geographically diverse group (crowd) that collectively issues requests on behalf of its members. Web servers are unable to learn the true source of a request because it is equally likely to have originated from any member of the crowd, and even collaborating crowd members cannot distinguish the originator of a request from a member who is merely forwarding the request on behalf of another. We describe the design, implementation, security, performance, and scalability of our system. Our security analysis introduces degrees of anonymity as an important tool for describing and proving anonymity properties. Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures by Roy Thomas Fielding , 2000 "...

Abstract - Cited by 1087 (1 self) - Add to MetaCart The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software. LabelMe: A Database and Web-Based Tool for Image Annotation by B. C. Russell, A. Torralba, K. P. Murphy, W. T. Freeman , 2008 "...

Abstract - Cited by 672 (47 self) - Add to MetaCart We seek to build a large collection of images with ground truth labels to be used for object detection and recognition research. Such data is useful for supervised learning and quantitative evaluation. To achieve this, we developed a web-based tool that allows easy image annotation and instant sharing of such annotations. Using this annotation tool, we have collected a large dataset that spans many object categories, often containing multiple instances over a wide variety of images. We quantify the contents of the dataset and compare against existing state of the art datasets used for object recognition and detection. Also, we show how to extend the dataset to automatically enhance object labels with WordNet, discover object parts, recover a depth ordering of objects in a scene, and increase the number of labels using minimal user supervision and images from the web. Bigtable: A distributed storage system for structured data by Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Mike Burrows, Tushar Chandra, Andrew Fikes, Robert E.

Abstract - Cited by 996 (3 self) - Add to MetaCart Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable. Ontologies: Silver Bullet for Knowledge Management and Electronic Commerce by Dieter Fensel , 2007 "...

Abstract - Cited by 643 (46 self) - Add to MetaCart Currently computers are changing from single isolated devices to entry points into a world wide network of information exchange and business transactions called the World Wide Web (WWW). Therefore support in the exchange of data, information, and knowledge exchange is becoming the key issue in current computer technology. Ontologies provide a shared and common understanding of a domain that can be communicated between people and application systems. Therefore, they may play a major role in supporting information exchange processes in various areas. This book discusses the role ontologies will play in knowledge management and in electronic commerce.

Abstract - Cited by 499 (23 self) - Add to MetaCart Today’s smartphone operating systems fail to provide users with adequate control and visibility into how third-party applications use their private data. We present TaintDroid, an efficient, system-wide dynamic taint tracking and analysis system for the popular Android platform that can simultaneously track multiple sources of sensitive data. TaintDroid’s efficiency to perform real-time analysis stems from its novel system design that leverages the mobile platform’s virtualized system architecture. TaintDroid incurs only 14 % performance overhead on a CPU-bound micro-benchmark with little, if any, perceivable overhead when running thirdparty applications. We use TaintDroid to study the behavior of 30 popular third-party Android applications and find several instances of misuse of users ’ private information. We believe that TaintDroid is the first working prototype demonstrating that dynamic taint tracking and analysis provides informed use of third-party applications in existing smartphone operating systems.
