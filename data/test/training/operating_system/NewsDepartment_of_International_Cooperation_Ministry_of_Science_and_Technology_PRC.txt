It was checked and accepted in June 1996. The headquarters of the Center resides in the high and new tech development zone in Beijing, whose director is Professor Jin Yilian --a well-known computer expert and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. The Center aims to develop commercialized parallel computer systems and to gradually form an industry of HPCs and eventually brings its products to both domestic and overseas markets. Computing Technology Institute of the Chinese Science Academy and Jiangnan Institute of Computing Technology are the two entities that the Center relied on. Established in the 1950s, these two prominent computer institutes are both comprehensive research organizations for computer science and technology. Various types of computers were developed in different period of the country’s computer development history. Both of them contributed a lot to the development of our national parallel computer technology. Technologically supported by those two giants, the Center has converted many R&D achievements into commercialized products that remain leading at home and advanced in the world. Major Engineering Development Fields ● Develop parallel computer hardware and system software; Establish our own HPC architectures based upon international advanced general components; Independently develop and produce parallel computers; Develop operating systems and parallel language compilers which are suited for our home-made parallel computers, with reference to international advanced overseas system software. ● Develop new application software and application systems and transplant them into domestic computer systems; Import advanced overseas application software such as numerical computation, data processing, graphics and image, database and so on; Study parallel algorithms for parallel computers and transplant these imported application software onto our home-made parallel computers. ● Develop series parallel computer products including large-sized, medium-sized and small-sized commercialized parallel computers; Develop various peripheral devices such as disk array and provide with a great variety of application software and software products such as application platforms and tools. Major Achievements ● In January 2001, Shanghai Supercomputing Center was founded, which takes the second  “SunWay- Ⅰ ” parallel supercomputer as the main computer system. The founding of this center will extend the wide range of applications of HPC to various fields in the eastern China, as well as make great contributions to the development of intellectual economy. ● In October 1999, the first “SunWay- Ⅰ ”supercomputer was installed in the State  Meteorological Agency to serve the weather forecasting, and on the basis of this system, the Beijing HPC Application Center was founded.    “SunWay” supercomputer is a large-scale scalable parallel computer system, with the peak speed of 384GFLOPS, which is listed at the 48 th place in the TOP 500 HPC commercial supercomputers. The system’s principal technical indexes come up to advanced world standard. The successful development of “SunWay ” supercomputer enables China to register as the third country with the ability to develop large-scale HPC systems following the steps of the U.S. and Japan. Those two “SunWay ” supercomputers in Beijing and Shanghai will provide a great number of system resources and computing abilities for the whole society free of charge within the coming two years. Different fields with large-scale computing demands are welcomed to contact us, so that the resources of  “SunWay” supercomputers can be fully made use of to develop our national economy as well as science and technology. ● The development of application system is much fruitful. Since the founding of the Center, nearly 100 items of large-scale and medium-scale application software have been developed for dozens of entities in the fields of petroleum industry, meteorology, aviation, life science, science research and national defense and etc. Great achievements have been made, which were impossible in the days of non-large scale computing. ● Serialized production lines are formed in the aspects of peripheral devices and information security, such as disk array, security router, encryption equipment and firewall. Those products have been applied to various fields and they are now taking most important roles in their own application. Technological Superiority and Correlated Services In the fields of the development of parallel computers, the research of parallel algorithms, the parallelization of the serial programs and the design of the application software based on the massively parallel processors (MPP) system, the Center is not only leading at home but also advanced in the world. The Center is dedicated to provide assistances and correlated high-grade technical services for solving large-scale computing problems confronted by various industries and scientific research fields. The NRCPCET will do his best to enhance china’s parallel computing technology, expand the application of parallel computer in various fields, and accelerate the self-development of our national parallel computer industry.
