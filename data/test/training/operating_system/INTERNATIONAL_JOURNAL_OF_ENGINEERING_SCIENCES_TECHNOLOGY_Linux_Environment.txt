NIS server used for high security in LINUX or another environment. NIS, or Network Information Systems, is a network service that allows authentication and login information to be stored on a centrally located server. This includes the username and password database for login authentication, database of user groups, and the locations of home directories 1. We use NIS services in centralized Network between client and server. For accessing the NIS server services in centralized Network we hafiles at the client end and server end. We will use the LINUX operating system. Keywords Centralized Network, NIS server, Linux operating system Introduction The Network Information System NIS is a safe environment for sharing data among large number of network Internet or intranet users. Also, this environment provides a secure and controlled access to the shared data2. The Network information Service NIS provides a robust and reliable naming service that holds information on network users, groups, host machines, servers, and generally all information necessary to operate a network. We use these services in Centralized network. Limitations The original NIS design was seen to have inherent limitations, especially in the areas of scalability and security, so other technologies have come to replace it.NIS used to have a major security flaw It left your password file readable by virtually anyone in the entire Internet, which made for quite a number of possible intruders. As long as an intruder knew your NIS domain name and the address of your server, he could simply send it a request for the password . Byname map and instantly receive all your systems encrypted passwords. With a fast passwordcracking program like crack and a good dictionary, guessing at least a few of your users passwords is rarely a problem. This is what the secure nets option is all about. It simply restricts access to your NIS server to certain hosts, based on their IP addresses or network numbers. The latest version of ypserv implements this feature in two ways. The first relies on a special configuration file    ISSN 2277                                                                                                               L OF ENGINEERING SCIENCES  RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY Linux Environment         Chaudhary1, Poonam Kshtriya2 cience, Banasthali Vidyapith University, Rajasthan, India.truptiverlekaryahoo.com  Abstract ve to configure the client and server configuration  .   called  etcypserv.

NIS allows a central server to manage password authentication, host, services, etc which would normally be provided by the local files. 2. A NISYP system maintains and distributes a central directory of user and group information, hostnames, eother textbased tables of information in a computer network. 9655 625628 n  from etchosts.allowand  .   mail aliases and  Chaudhary, 23 March, 2013   ISSN 22779655                                                                                                                http  www.ijesrt.com         C International Journal of Engineering Sciences  Research Technology625628  3. NIS adds another global user list which is used for identifying users on any client of the NIS domain. 4. NIS server is set up in a single system and configured to hold user accounts and their passwords and access information. Then any user on that network can login to hisher account that is set up in the NIS server from any system with nis client running on that configured network. This gives a look and feel that the user is logged into hisher own system. But actually its the account on the NIS server that is mounted on the local sytem on user login .  Installation At the LINUX environment, we have to install the client and server packages. For installing the client and server package we have to used some commands which are given below  Client Installation ypbind ypbind finds the server for NIS domains and maintains the NIS binding information. The client normaly the NIS routines in the standard C library could get the information over RPC from ypbind or read the binding files. The binding files resides in the directory varypbinding and are conventionally named  domainname. version. The supported versions are 1 and 2. There could be several such files since it is possible for an NIS client to be bound to more then one domain.  Server Installation 1ypserv The ypserv daemon is typically activated at system startup. ypserv runs only on NIS server machines with a complete NIS database. 2rpcbind The rpcbind utility is a server that converts RPC program numbers into universal addresses. It must be running on the host to be able to make RPC calls on a server on that machine. When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which it is listening, and the RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve. When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it first contacts rpcbind on the server machine to determine the address where RPC requests should be sent. The rpcbind utility should be started before any other RPC service. Normally, standard RPC servers are started by port monitors, so rpcbind must be started before port monitors are invoked. When rpcbind is started, it checks that certain nametoaddress translationcalls function correctly. If they fail, the network  configuration databases may be corrupt. Since RPC services cannot function correctly in this situation, rpcbind reports the condition and terminates.  Configuration In centralized network, we configure the client and server by using several files in LINUX which are given below Client Configuration After installation we have to configure many files which are given below  aetcsys.confignetwork The etcsysconfignetwork file is used to specify information about the desired network configuration. The following values may be used NETWORKINGvalue, where value is one of the following boolean values yes  Networking should be configured. no  Networking should not be configured. HOSTNAMEvalue, where value should be the Fully Qualified Domain Name FQDN, such ashostname.expample.com, but can be whatever hostname is necessary. GATEWAYvalue, where value is the IP address of the networks gateway. GATEWAYDEVvalue, where value is the gateway device, such as eth0. Configure this option if you have multiple interfaces on the same subnet, and require one of those interfaces to be the preferred route to the default gateway. NISDOMAINsits,where value is the NIS domain name. NOZEROCONFvalue, where setting value to true disables the zeroconf route.  betcsysconfigauthconfig The etcsysconfigauthconfig file sets the authorization to be used on the host. It contains one or more of the following lines USEMD5value, where value is one of the following yes MD5 is used for authentication. no MD5 is not used for authentication. USEKERBEROSvalue, where value is one of the following yes Kerberos is used for authentication. no Kerberos is not used for authentication. USELDAPAUTHvalue, where value is one of the following yesLDAP is used for authentication. noLDAP is not used for authentication.  cetcyp.conf ypbind  finds  the server for NIS domains and maintains the NIS binding        information. The client normaly the NIS routines  in  the  standard  C   Chaudhary, 23 March, 2013   ISSN 22779655                                                                                                                http  www.ijesrt.com         C International Journal of Engineering Sciences  Research Technology625628  library could  get  the  information over RPC from ypbind or read the binding files. The binding files resides in the directory varypbinding and are conventionally named domainname.version. The supported versions are 1 and 2.  There could be several such files since it  is        possible for an NIS client to be bound to more then one domain. After  a binding  has been established, ypbind will send YPPROCDOMAIN requests to the current NIS server  at  20  seconds  intervals. If  it doesnt get an response or the NIS server reports that he doesnt have       this domain any longer, ypbind will search for a new NIS server. All 15 minutes ypbind will check  to  see  if the current NIS server is the fastest. If it find a server which answers faster, it  will  switch  to        this server.  You could tell ypbind to use network broadcasts to find a new server, what is insecure, or you could give it  a  list  of  known secure  servers. In  this case ypbind will send a ping to all servers and binds to first one which answers.       Unless the option debug is used, ypbind detaches itself from the  controlling  terminal  and puts itself into background.  ypbind uses syslog3 for logging errors and warnings. At startup or  when  receiving signal SIGHUP, ypbind parses the file etcyp.conf and tries to use the        entries for its initial binding. Valid entries are domain nisdomain server hostname.      Use server hostname for the domain nisdomain. You  could  have more than one entry of this type for a single domain.      domain nisdomain broadcast Use broadcast on the local net for domain nisdomain. ypserver hostname Use server server for the local domain. A   broadcast   entry  in  the  configuration  file  will  overwrite  a ypserverserver entry and a ypserverserver  entry  broadcast.  If  all        given server are down, ypbind will not switch to use broadcast. Ypbind will try at first etchosts and then DNS for resolving the hosts names from etcyp.conf.  If ypbind couldnt reconfigure the search order, it will use only DNS.  If DNS isnt available,  you  could only  use  IP      addresses  in  etchosts.   ypbind  could  only reconfigure the search order with glibc 2.x.  If the broadcast option is specified, ypbind will ignore the configuration file.  If the file does not exist or if there are no valid entries, ypbind exit.       This ypbind is a special version which uses pthreads.  It will start 2 more threads. The master process services RPC requests asking for binding info. The first thread initializes the binding and checks it        periodically.  Upon failure, the binding is invalidated and the process tries again to find a valid server. The second thread will handle all the signals.  detcnsswith.conf The operating system uses a number of databases of  information  about  hosts,  users  passwdshadow, groups and so      forth.  Data for these can come from a variety of sources hostnames  and  addresses,  for  example,  may be found in etchosts, NIS, NIS or DNS.  One or more  sources  may  be      used  for  each database the sources and their lookup order are specified in the etcnsswitch.conf file.  eetcpam.dsystemauth The purpose of these configuration files are to provide a common interface for all applications and service daemons calling into the PAM library. The systemauth configuration file is included from nearly all individual service configuration files with the help of the include directive.The passwordauth fingerprintauth smartcardauth configuration files are for applications which handle authentication from different types of devices via simultaneously running individual conversations instead of one aggregate conversation.  Server Configuration avarypMakefile Makefile is used for change the MERGE GROUPfalse in line no. 42 and in line no. 117 we replace group by shadow and remove the mail option.  bvarypsecurenets NIS listens to all networks, if the varypsecurenets file is blank or does not exist as is the case after a default installation. One of the first things to do is to put netmasknetwork pairs in the file so that ypserv only responds to requests from the proper network. Below is a sample entry from a varypsecurenets file             255.255.255.0192.168.0.0  cetchosts The hosts file is one of several system facilities that assists in addressing network nodes in a computer network. It is a common part of an operating systems Internet Protocol IP implementation, and serves the function of translating humanfriendly hostnames into numeric protocol addresses, called IP addresses, that identify and locate a host in an IP network. In some operating systems, the hosts files content is used preferentially to other methods, such as the Domain Name System DNS, but many systems implement name service switches e.g., nsswitch.conf for Linux and Unix to provide customization. Unlike the DNS, the hosts file is under the direct control of the local computers administrator.

Here we have to give the domain name of the server side and server IP address and click on OK button. After completing this process NIS server binding completed. After that we switch the user using su command.      su subh                                           After that we can accesss the any account and permissions like reading, writing and executing. By using the ypcat command we can check all users of the server side. In the above figure we can see many user account like rom, mom, jyoti, ram, subh, devil, non, redhat, pransh and jyoti. bSteps are followed for server Above server configuration steps are followed for making the server.  Conclusion Security is the major  problem in the centralized network. Authentication gives the best security in the network. In LINUX, NIS server is used for authentication services. NIS server hold the all client information and client can access the all account information and use it without any workload. Without having information of the server client can not aacess the information or user account of the server.But NIS does not send the information in encrypted form, so this is the main flaw of the NIS server.This can be solved by LDAP serverLight Directory Access Protocol. LDAP server, we will implement in future.  Future Work Some drawbacks we are facing in the implementation like NIS server is not secure. Transfered information is not in encrypted. LDAP light directory access protocol removes the limitations. We will authenticate the centralized network by using LDAP.
