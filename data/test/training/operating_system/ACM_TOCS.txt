Zhao, Elizabeth S. Yang Modern storage technology (solid-state disks (SSDs), NoSQL databases, commoditized RAID hardware, etc.) brings new reliability challenges to the already-complicated storage stack. Among other things, the behavior of these new components during power faults—which happen relatively frequently in data centers—is an important yet mostly...

We present ix, a dataplane operating system that provides high I/O performance and high resource efficiency while maintaining the...

Lee Computational sprinting is a class of mechanisms that boost performance but dissipate additional power. We describe a sprinting architecture in which many, independent chip multiprocessors share a power supply and sprints are constrained by the chips’ thermal limits and the rack’s power limits. Moreover, we present the computational...

Unfortunately, Web applications often incur large performance overhead, directly affecting user quality-of-service (QoS) experience. Traditional techniques in improving mobile processor performance has mostly been adopting desktop-like design techniques such as increasing single-core microarchitecture complexity and aggressively integrating more cores. However, such a desktop-oriented strategy is likely coming to an end due to the stringent energy and thermal constraints that mobile devices impose. In this paper, we propose to combine hardware customization and specialization techniques to improve the performance and energy efficiency of mobile Web applications. We first perform design-space exploration (DSE) and identify opportunities in customizing existing general-purpose mobile processors, i.e., tuning microarchitecture parameters. The through DSE also lets us discover sources of energy inefficiency in customized general-purpose architectures. To mitigate these inefficiencies, we propose two new domain-specific specializations, called the Style Resolution Unit and the Browser Engine Cache. Our optimizations boost performance and energy efficiency at the same time while maintaining general-purpose programmability. As emerging mobile workloads increasingly rely more on Web technologies, the type of optimizations we propose will become important in the future and are likely to have long-lasting and widespread impact. Reining in Long Tails in Warehouse-Scale Computers with Quick Voltage Boosting using Adrenaline Chang-Hong Hsu (University of Michigan); Yunqi Zhang (University of Michigan); Michael A. Laurenzano (University of Michigan); David Meisner (Facebook Inc); Thomas F. Wenisch (University of Michigan); Ronald G. Dreslinski (University of Michigan); Jason Mars (University of Michigan); Lingjia Tang (University of Michigan) Reducing the long tail of the query latency distribution in modern WSCs is critical for improving performance and quality-of-service of workloads such as Web Search and Memcached. Traditional turbo boost increases a processors voltage and frequency during a coarse-grain sliding window, boosting all queries that are processed during that window. However, the inability of such a technique to pinpoint tail queries for boosting limits its tail reduction benefit. In this work, we propose Adrenaline, an approach to leverage finer granularity, 10s of nanoseconds, voltage boosting to effectively rein in the tail latency with query-level precision. Two key insights underlie this work. First, emerging finer granularity voltage/frequency boosting is an enabling mechanism for intelligent allocation of the power budget to precisely boost only the queries that contribute to the tail latency; and second, per-query characteristics can be used to design indicators for proactively pinpointing these queries, triggering boosting accordingly. Based on these insights, Adrenaline achieves up to a 2.50x tail latency improvement for Memcached and up to a 3.03x for Web Search over coarse-grained DVFS given a fixed boosting power budget. By using the carefully chosen boost thresholds, Adrenaline further improves the tail latency reduction to 4.82x over coarse-grain DVFS.
