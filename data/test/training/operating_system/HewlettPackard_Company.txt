1.1 What You Need to Know First
For this release of HP Fortran, HP provides two separate compilers (HP Fortran
and HP Fortran 77) under one license and one name (HP Fortran). You can
choose to install and/or use either compiler or both compilers
By default, the FORTRAN command invokes the HP Fortran compiler, which
supports the Fortran 90 and 95 standards as well as older versions of the
Fortran language. If you choose to also install the older HP Fortran 77 compiler
programmers can request the HP Fortran 77 compiler by using the OLDF
qualifier on the FORTRAN command line
You can install the Compaq Extended Math Library (CXML) separately from HP
Fortran, which allows you to call the CXML routines from either HP Fortran or
HP Fortran
You can install CXML either before or after you install HP Fortran. See
Chapter
1.2 Reading the Release Notes
You can extract the HP Fortran release notes to a file and type or print them
before starting HP Fortran installation. The HP Fortran release notes are also
installed on your system after installation
For information about using the CDMENU utility and locating the appropriate
media CD-ROM, see the first few steps in Section
For information about reading the online release notes before installation, use
the PRODUCT EXTRACT RELEASE_NOTES command described in Section
(step
Preparing for HP Fortran Installation
HP strongly recommends that you read the release notes before installing HP
Fortran. They contain information about changes to the installation and use
of HP Fortran, such as the minimum version of the OpenVMS Alpha operating
system required for this release of HP Fortran
After installation, the release notes are installed as text and PostScript form in
SYSHELPFORTRANRELEASENOTES
SYSHELPFORTRANRELEASENOTESPS
Release notes for CXML are provided separately. After CXML installation, the
CXML release notes are installed in
SYSHELPCXMLVRELEASENOTESTXT
The CXML Reference Guide is also provided in PostScript form in the SYSHELP
directory
1.3 Required Operating System Components
HP Fortran Version 8.2 requires the OpenVMS Alpha operating system Version
7.3-2 or higher
Future HP Fortran releases may require higher versions of the operating system
as described in the release notes or the cover letter
The OpenVMS operating system comes with a variety of support options or
components). To use HP Fortran, your system should be running a version of the
OpenVMS operating system that includes the base component and the following
other components
• Programming support
• Utilities
For a complete list of the required components, see the HP Fortran Software
Product Description (SPD) on the media CDROM
1.4 License Registration
Before you install and run HP Fortran Version 8.2 on a newly-licensed node or
cluster), you must first register a License Product Authorization Key License
PAK), using the License Management Facility (LMF). CXML does not require a
License PAK
Ths specific LMP product names used by HP Fortran are
• FORTRAN or FORTRAN90: Unlimited or Personal-Use License
• FORTRAN-USER or FORTRAN90-USER: Concurrent-Use License
The HP Fortran and HP Fortran 77 compilers will each accept either a
FORTRAN(-USER) or FORTRAN90(-USER) PAK. It is not required that
PAKs for both product names of a given license type be loaded
The License PAK may be shipped along with the kit if you ordered the license
and media together. Otherwise, it is shipped separately to a location based on
your license order. If you are installing HP Fortran as an update on a node or
cluster already licensed for this software, you have already completed the License
PAK registration requirements
1–2 Preparing for HP Fortran Installation
If you are installing prerequisite or optional software along with HP Fortran
review the PAK status and install the PAKs for any prerequisite or optional
software before you install HP Fortran
You must register and load your license for HP Fortran before you start the
installation in order to run the Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) and use
the software
Log in to a privileged account, such as the system manager’s account, SYSTEM
You have a choice of two ways to register a license
• Invoke the SYS$UPDATE:VMSLICENSE.COM procedure. When it prompts
you for information, respond with data from your License PAK
• At the DCL prompt, enter the LICENSE REGISTER command with the
appropriate qualifiers that correspond to License PAK information
If you plan to use HP Fortran on more than one node in a cluster, you will need
to perform a license load on the other nodes after you complete this installation
See Section
For complete information on using LMF, see the HP OpenVMS License
Management Utility Manual
1.5 Installation Procedure Requirements
After you have registered and loaded the license PAK and read the appropriate
parts of this installation guide, the installation takes approximately 2 to
minutes, depending on your system configuration
1.5.1 Installation Account Privileges and Disk Space
To install HP Fortran or CXML, you must be logged in to an account that has at
least the following privileges enabled
• BYPASS
• CMKRNL
• SYSLCK
• SYSPRV
Table 1–1 lists HP Fortran’s requirements for free disk storage space

To determine the number of free disk blocks on the current system disk, enter the
following DCL command
$ SHOW DEVICE SYSSYSDEVICE
Preparing for HP Fortran Installation
1.5.2 System Parameters
Installing HP Fortran (both compilers) requires certain system parameter
settings
The minimum number of free global pagelets (512-byte subpage unit) and global
sections needed is eleven (11) global sections and approximately 20,000 contiguous
free global pagelets, plus a sufficient number of contiguous free global pagelets to
contain the file SYS$LIBRARY:DCLTABLES.EXE. (See Section
If the optional Compaq Extended Math Library is installed, an additional
global sections and 50,000 contiguous free global pagelets are required
These values represent the number of free global pagelets and global sections
required for the installation, not the total number you need to run your system
and other software
Note
If you do not ensure that your system has the necessary global pagelets
and global section SYSGEN parameters for the installation, the DCL
tables can become corrupted in some situations
1.5.2.1 Calculating Values for GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS
To install and run HP Fortran, you must have sufficient free global pagelets and
global sections
Enter the following DCL command to determine the number of global pagelets
required by SYSLIBRARYDCLTABLESEXE
$ DIRECTORY/SIZE SYSLIBRARYDCLTABLESEXE
This command returns the size (in blocks) of SYSLIBRARYDCLTABLESEXE
As an approximation, use this figure as the number of global pagelets for the file
You can use the WRITE command with the F$GETSYI lexical function to find the
number of free contiguous global pagelets and free global sections. The following
example shows how to get this information at your terminal (the default for
SYSOUTPUT
$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT FGETSYICONTIGGBLPAGES

$ WRITE SYS$OUTPUT FGETSYIFREEGBLSECTS

If the value of free global pagelets or global sections is less than the required
value (see Section 1.5.2), you must increase the system parameter setting
Section 1.5.2.2 describes the procedures for increasing these values using
AUTOGEN
1.5.2.2 Changing System Parameter Values with AUTOGEN
If you do not have enough free global pagelets or free global sections to install
HP Fortran, you can use the AUTOGEN command procedure to increase the
GBLPAGES or GBLSECTIONS system parameters
AUTOGEN automatically adjusts values for parameters that are associated with
the values you reset manually. To change system parameters with AUTOGEN
edit the following file
1–4 Preparing for HP Fortran Installation
SYSSYSTEMMODPARAMSDAT
To change a parameter value listed in this file, delete the current value associated
with that parameter and enter the new value
To add a new parameter, add a line to the file that specifies the name of the
parameter and its value. To modify incremental parameters such as GBLPAGES
and GBLSECTIONS, use the ADD_ prefix
After you make all your changes, exit from the editor
When you execute the AUTOGEN procedure to recalculate your system
parameters, AUTOGEN uses the information in your MODPARAMS.DAT file
and also can automatically adjust some of the SYSGEN parameters based on the
consumption of resources since the last reboot
For information about using AUTOGEN and its command-line parameters, see
the HP OpenVMS System Manager’s Manual, Volume 2: Tuning, Monitoring, and
Complex Systems
1.6 Backing Up Your System Disk
HP recommends that you do a system disk backup before installing any software
Use the backup procedures that are established at your site. For details on
performing a system disk backup, see the Using VMS BACKUP manual
1.7 Recovering from Installation Errors
Errors can occur during the installation if any of the following conditions exist
• The operating system version is incorrect
• The privileges or disk space for successful installation are insufficient
For descriptions of error messages generated by these and related conditions
see the OpenVMS Alpha documentation on system messages and software
installation or the online HELP/MESSAGE command. Take the appropriate
action described in the message
For information on system requirements for installing HP Fortran, see
Section
For a list of problems that can cause an unsuccessful installation, see Section
To report a problem to HP, see Section
Preparing for HP Fortran Installation

2.1 How to Install HP Fortran
The installation procedure loads HP Fortran product distribution files on to the
system disk on the system where you perform the installation
Follow these steps to install HP Fortran from the OpenVMS Alpha Software
Products Library CD-ROM set
1. Log in to a privileged account on the system (or cluster) where you will install
HP Fortran. This account must have the following privileges enabled
• BYPASS
• CMKRNL
• SYSLCK
• SYSPRV
If your process has the SETPRV privilege, you can enable these privileges by
entering the following command
$ SET PROCESSPRIVILEGEBYPASSCMKRNLSYSLCKSYSPRV
To check whether your process has these privileges enabled, enter the
following command
$ SHOW PROCESSPRIVILEGES
2. To obtain the kit directory location of the HP Fortran product distribution
files on the appropriate OpenVMS Alpha Software Product Library CDROM
(media CD-ROM), do one of the following
• Use the CDMENU utility provided on the media CDROM
• View the CD-ROM master index file on the media CDROM
• Contact the appropriate system manager
3. To determine whether the appropriate media CD-ROM is already mounted on
your system, enter the following command
Installing HP Fortran
$ SHOW DEVICE DKA
Note
DKA400 is the device name used in examples in this document to show
where the appropriate media CD-ROM has been mounted
4. If the media CD-ROM containing the HP Fortran installation files is not
mounted, either contact the appropriate system manager or insert the
appropriate media CD-ROM (write down the volume label) into an available
CD-ROM drive. Enter the appropriate MOUNT command to mount the media
CD-ROM (omit the /FOREIGN qualifier), such as the following
$ MOUNT DKA400 label
Where label is the volume label of that media CDROM
5. To check that you have located the correct CD-ROM device and directory, use
the following DIRECTORY command
$ DIRECTORY PCSICOMPRESSED
Directory DKAdirsubdir
DECAXPVMSFORTRANVnnnnxPCSICOMPRESSED
DECAXPVMSFORTRANVnnnnxPCSICOMPRESSEDESW
Total of 2 files
6. Check that the HP Fortran compiler product distribution files copied from
the HP Internet FTP area and decompressed are available on your local node
or cluster. If it is not already mounted, mount the disk (MOUNT command
containing the HP Fortran product distribution files. Refer to the field test
cover letter for FTP copying and decompressing instructions
7. To extract the HP Fortran online release notes before you install HP Fortran
enter the following command
$ PRODUCT EXTRACT RELEASE_NOTES FORTRAN /SOURCE=disk:[dir]
FILEFORTRANRELEASENOTES
In this command, disk:[dir] is the specification of the disk and directory
containing the product installation files. If your process default directory
is the directory on the CD-ROM that contains the HP Fortran product
distribution files, you can specify the /SOURCE directory as /SOURCE=[
You can view or print the file FORTRAN.RELEASE_NOTES before you
continue with the installation (next command). For example
$ TYPE/PAGE FORTRANRELEASENOTES
8. If DEC Fortran 90 Version 2.0 was previously installed on this system, it
must be removed before HP Fortran is installed. To determine if DEC Fortran

The HP Fortran Installation Verification Procedure (IVP) runs automatically
during HP Fortran installation. Similarly, the Compaq Extended Math Library
(CXML) IVP runs during CXML installation
If system problems occur, you should run the HP Fortran IVP separately to
ensure the integrity of the installed files. To run the IVP, enter the following
command
$ SYSTESTFORTIVPCOM
If any problems are encountered, a message such as the following appears
HP Fortran Version 8.2 TEST FAILED
Similarly, you can run the CXML IVP after installation, or at other times, to
ensure the integrity of installed files if system problems have occurred. You
need system privileges to run the CXML IVP. To run the CXML IVP, execute the
following command procedure
$ SYSTESTCXMLIVPCOM
If the IVP runs successfully, you will see the following display
CXML-I-IVP> Completed CXML Vnnnn Installation Verification Procedure
After Installing HP Fortran
3.2 Modifying the System-Wide Startup Command Procedure
Add the following lines to the system-wide startup file (if you have not done
so previously), such as the file SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM or a
command procedure that it invokes
$ SYSSTARTUPFORTSTARTUP
$ SYSSTARTUPCXMLSTARTUP
These command procedures install HP Fortran and CXML images in memory and
perform related actions
The Fortran startup procedure line does not take any parameters arguments
The CXML startup procedure line lets you specify certain parameters to
• Control the default CXML link library
• Specify names of CXML shareable images to be installed as shared images
• Specify names of CXML shareable images to be installed as resident images
Among other things, inserting this line in the startup procedure makes the
correct CXML library available automatically, eliminating the need for the user
to explicitly specify the CXML link library on the LINK command line
In addition, individual users can select a user-specific default CXML link library
by executing the SYS$LIBRARY:CXML$SET_LIB command procedure
For more information on the CXML startup procedure arguments and specifying
a user-specific default CXML link library, see Section
3.3 Making the Product Usable on a VMScluster
If you want to run HP Fortran on multiple nodes of a VMScluster, first check
to see that you have the appropriate software license (see Section 1.4). Then
perform the following steps after you install HP Fortran
1. Issue the LICENSE LOAD command, as described in the HP OpenVMS
License Management Utility Manual, to activate the license on each node in
the VMScluster on which HP Fortran is to be executed
2. The commands in this step should be executed on all cluster nodes, whether
or not they are licensed to use HP Fortran; failure to do so may cause
unexpected errors for users
Note
If you are using a dual-architecture (VAX and Alpha systems
heterogeneous cluster, before executing these commands, make sure
the appropriate logical names have been set to define the scope of the
SYSMAN DO commands. For more information, see the HP OpenVMS
System Manager’s Manual
3. While logged in as SYSTEM, or as another username that has the CMKRNL
and SYSPRV privileges enabled, use the OpenVMS SYSMAN utility to make
the new versions of shareable images available, as follows
3–2 After Installing HP Fortran
$ RUN SYSSYSTEMSYSMAN
SYSMAN> SET ENVIRONMENTCLUSTER
%SYSMAN-I-ENV, current command environment
Clusterwide on local cluster
Username SYSTEM will be used on nonlocal nodes
SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REPLACE SYSLIBRARYDCLTABLESEXE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REPLACE SYSLIBRARYDECFORRTLEXE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
SYSMAN> DO INSTALL REPLACE SYSLIBRARYDPMLSHREXE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
If any of the INSTALL commands fail, reboot the affected node
The SYSMAN utility will cause each DO command to be executed on all nodes
of the local cluster
4. The SYS$STARTUP:FORT$STARTUP.COM file installs the compilers as a
known image. This command procedure file should be executed on all cluster
nodes using the following DO command
SYSMAN> DO SYSSTARTUPFORTSTARTUP
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
%SYSMAN-I-OUTPUT, command execution on node NODE
5. Finally, exit from SYSMAN
SYSMAN> EXIT

3.4 Making the FORTRAN Command Available After Installation
HP Fortran is now installed and can be invoked by all users with the FORTRAN
command
The installation procedure modifies the DCL command table so that the
FORTRAN commands are recognized and processed. However, the previous
command table is still in effect for those users who are currently logged in
All logged-in users who want to use the FORTRAN command must log out and
log in again, or use the following DCL command
$ SET COMMAND TABLESSYSLIBRARYDCLTABLES
3.5 Setting User Account Quotas
No special privileges are needed to use HP Fortran. There is no benefit from
installing the compilers with privileges
To use HP Fortran, a user account does not need to meet any special quota
requirements. However, for users who will be compiling very large programs
(many program units compiled together) or running very large performance
critical programs, consider the adjusting working set (WSDEF, WSQUOTA
WSEXTENT) and page file (PGFLQUOTA) account quotas to improve
performance
Use the OpenVMS Authorize Utility from a suitably privileged account to change
the process quotas in the user authorization file (UAF). Some sites may restrict
the use of the Authorize Utility to certain accounts or people
After Installing HP Fortran
After the quotas for the account have been changed, the user should log out of the
account and log in again for the new quotas to take effect
For information on using the Authorize Utility, see the HP OpenVMS System
Manager’s Manual, Volume 1: Essentials
3.6 Enhancing HP Fortran Performance
This section includes information on system tuning and explains how to install
HP Fortran as a shared image
After you install HP Fortran, you might want to adjust your system to enhance
performance or lower the use of some system resources
If users will be compiling very large programs (many program units compiled
together) or running very large performance-critical programs, consider the
following
• Check that adequate page file space exists. Large programs need more
virtual memory during compilation and execution than small programs. Use
the INSTALL command to extend an existing page file or create one or more
new page files
• The SYSGEN parameter virtual page count is related to the total amount of
page file space. If you create more page file space, review the virtual page
count parameter and increase it if necessary
• The SYSGEN parameter maximum working set (WSMAX) might also be
checked if a larger process working set is needed
For more information on page file use and SYSGEN parameters, see the HP
OpenVMS System Manager’s Manual, Volume 2: Tuning, Monitoring, and
Complex Systems. For information about system tuning and performance
investigation, see the Guide to OpenVMS Performance Management
3.7 Removing HP Fortran
To remove HP Fortran from the system, use the following command
$ PRODUCT REMOVE FORTRAN
You may be asked if you would like to also remove the FORRTL product. HP
recommends that you answer NO to this prompt
After removing HP Fortran from the system, remove the call to
SYS$STARTUP:FORT$STARTUP.COM from your system startup procedure
To remove Compaq Extended Math Library from the system, use the following
command
$ PRODUCT REMOVE CXML
After removing Compaq Extended Math Library from the system, remove the call
to SYS$STARTUP:CXML$STARTUP.COM from your system startup procedure
3–4 After Installing HP Fortran
3.8 Performing CXML Postinstallation Startup Tasks
As part of the post-installation process described in Section 3.2, you need to add
the following line to your system’s startup procedure
SYSSTARTUPCXMLSTARTUP
Among other things, inserting this line in the startup procedure will make the
correct CXML library available automatically, eliminating the need for the user
to explicitly specify the CXML link library on the LINK command line
In addition, individual users can select a user-specific default CXML link library
by executing the SYS$LIBRARY:CXML$SET_LIB command procedure, as
described in Section
This command procedure has three system-wide default parameters, which you
can optionally change (as described below). The default parameters control the
following things
• The first parameter sets the default CXML link library. Its default value is
IEEE
• The second parameter is a list of the names of CXML shareable images to be
installed as shared images. Its default value is " " none
• The third parameter is a list of the names of CXML shareable images to be
installed as resident images. Its default value is " " none
If the default parameter values described above are acceptable, you can skip the
rest of this step
If you want to change any of these parameters, use the following instructions
3.8.1 Setting CXML System-Wide Parameters
The first parameter controls the default CXML link library. If it has the
value "IEEE", the library of routines using IEEE floating-point format will
be designated as the default CXML link library. If its value is "VAX", the library
of VAX floating-point format routines will be designated as the default CXML link
library. The default value of this first parameter is "IEEE". If it does not have
the value "VAX" or "IEEE", an error message will be given
The second parameter is a list of the names of CXML shareable images to be
installed as shared images. Its default value is
The third parameter is a list of the names of CXML shareable images to be
installed as resident images. Its default value is
The list entries are not case-sensitive. If more than one name appears in a list
the names are separated by commas. The list may contain only the above names
and comma(s). If a CXML shareable image name appears in both lists, it will be
installed as a shared image
For example, the following command will set the default CXML link library to
be the one using IEEE floating-point format and will install the IEEEformat
COMMON shareable image along with all the IEEE-format BLAS shareable
images as resident images. No other CXML shareable images will be installed
$ @SYS$STARTUP:CXML$STARTUP IEEE ""
$_ IEEEBLASIEEEBLASEIEEEBLASIEEEBLASIEEECOMMON
After Installing HP Fortran
To install CXML images, your system must have sufficient resources available
Refer to the following tables to obtain the total number of global resources
required
If you are installing images as a /SHARED resource, add all relevant entries
under the columns GBLPAGES and GBLSECTIONS. Then check that your
system is configured with a sufficient number of free global pages and free global
sections to accommodate the images to be installed
If you are installing images as /RESIDENT resources, add all relevant entries
under the column GH_RSRVPGCNT. Check that your system has sufficient free
pages in the resident image code area of the granularity hint region
3.8.2 Select a User-Specific Default CXML Link Library
Individual users can change the CXML link library by changed by invoking
SYS$LIBRARY:CXML$SET_LIB from their process
The system-wide default CXML link library is set using the system startup file
SYS$STARTUP:CXML$STARTUP, as described in Section 3.8.1. In addition
individual users may change their own specific default library by invoking
SYS$LIBRARY:CXML$SET_LIB themselves. For example, the following
command alters the default CXML link library for the current user to the
VAX format library
$ @SYS$LIBRARY:CXML$SET_LIB VAX
For information on using CXML, see the Compaq Extended Math Library
Reference Guide or the Web site at
httpwwwhpcomtechserverssoftwarecxml
3.9 Troubleshooting the Installation
If your installation is not successful, check for the following possible problems
• The appropriate PAK must be available to the user performing the
installation. The PAK must be registered and loaded before you can install
HP Fortran. For information about registering a PAK, see Section 1.4. Then
reinstall HP Fortran
• The DCLTABLES.EXE file should be in the SYSCOMMONSYSLIB
directory. There should not be a copy of DCLTABLES.EXE in
SYSSPECIFICSYSLIB
If a copy of DCLTABLES.EXE is found in a SYS$SPECIFIC root, rename it to
DCLTABLES.OLD, do an INSTALL REPLACE SYSLIBRARYDCLTABLES
then reinstall HP Fortran
• The system logical name SYS$SYSROOT should not be modified from the
preset definition provided by the OpenVMS Alpha operating system
3.10 Getting Help and Reporting Problems
If an error occurs while HP Fortran is in use and you believe the error is caused
by a problem with HP Fortran, do one of the following
• If you have a Software Product Services Support Agreement, contact your
Customer Support Center (CSC) by telephone (in the United States,
354-9000) or by using the electronic means provided with your support
3–6 After Installing HP Fortran
agreement. You can use DSNlink or other electronic means to report the
problem to the CSC
• If you do not have a service contract, you can arrange for per-call CSC
support
When you initially contact the CSC, indicate the following
• The name and version number of the operating system (OpenVMS Alpha) you
are using
• The name (HP Fortran) and version number of HP Fortran you are using
• The hardware system you are using (such as a model number
• How critical the problem is
• A very brief description of the problem (one sentence if possible
When you submit information electronically or are speaking on the phone to the
appropriate support specialist, you can provide more detailed information. This
includes the specific commands used to compile and link the program, the error
messages displayed, and relevant detailed information (possibly including source
program listings). Ttry to narrow the cause of the problem to a specific source
module or lines of code
CSC personnel may ask for additional information, such as listings of any
command files, INCLUDE files, relevant data files, and so forth. If the
program is longer than 50 lines, submit a copy of it electronically or provide
machine-readable media (floppy diskette or magnetic tape
Experience shows that problem reports sometimes do not contain enough
information to duplicate or identify the problem. Concise, complete information
helps HP give accurate and timely service to software problems
To obtain information about purchasing HP support services, contact your local
sales representative

Installation Messages
This appendix lists the more common diagnostic messages you might see during
product installation. If you encounter a message not shown here, use the
HELP/MESSAGE command to display information about it. If you add the LOG
qualifier to the PRODUCT INSTALL command, many additional informational
messages will be displayed, which can be ignored
FAILCONF, failed to resolve conflicting requirements for objecttype
objectname
Explanation: More than one product supplies a managed object of the same
name, type, and scope. They cannot coexist because of a
conflict in the objects’ properties. Files, directories, and
library modules are examples of managed objects
User Action: If you are installing the FORRTL kit on OpenVMS 7.1, ignore this
message and continue the installation. Otherwise, report the
problem to HP
INSTALLERR, error executing DCL INSTALL command
Explanation: The POLYCENTER Software Installation utility installs a file
as a known image by having the DCL command INSTALL execute in
a subprocess. The INSTALL command failed
User Action: Take action based on the accompanying messages. If you specify
the /TRACE qualifier when you retry the operation, you can
view the command sent to the subprocess
IVPFAILURE, test procedure completed with an error status
Explanation: The installation verification test procedure for the product
completed with an exit status that indicates a failure. If you
were executing a PRODUCT INSTALL command, the product has been
completely installed, but its test procedure failed
User Action: Take action based on the accompanying messages. If you specify
the /TRACE qualifier when you retry the operation, you can
view the commands sent to the subprocess and the output
generated when these commands are executed
RETAIN, ’object’ ’object-name’ was not replaced because object
from kit does not have higher generation number
Explanation: During installation of a software product (or a patch to
a software product), the specified object (either a file
or a library module) was not copied from the kit to the
destination disk. The installation utility found an object
with the same name already installed on the destination disk
and that object’s generation (sequencing) number was the same
or greater than the generation number of the object from the
kit. Therefore, the object with the latest generation number
(the previously installed item) was left on your destination
disk
Installation Messages B
This condition typically occurs when you install multiple
patches or updates to the same product. The installation
utility performs conflict detection and resolution so that
your system will always retain the most current files even if
updates are not installed in chronological order
User Action: None
