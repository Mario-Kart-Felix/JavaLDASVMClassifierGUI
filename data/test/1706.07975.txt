Sparsity-Based STAP Design Based on Alternating
Direction Method with Gain/Phase Errors
Zhaocheng Yang, Member IEEE, Rodrigo C. de Lamare, Senior Member IEEE, and Weijian Liu Member IEEE
Abstract—We present a novel sparsity-based space-time adap-
tive processing (STAP) technique based on the alternating di-
rection method to overcome the severe performance degradation
caused by array gain/phase (GP) errors. The proposed algorithm
reformulates the STAP problem as a joint optimization problem
of the spatio-Doppler profile and GP errors in both single and
multiple snapshots, and introduces a target detector using the
reconstructed spatio-Doppler profiles. Simulations are conducted
to illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm.
I. INTRODUCTION
Ground moving target detection (GMTD) in surveillance
airborne radar is a crucial task for many military and civilian
applications. The technique of moving target indication (MTI)
exploits the differences of the Doppler frequencies between the
targets and clutter for the detection of targets [1]. However,
targets are often obscured by the spreading Doppler spectrum
of the clutter due to the moving airborne platform, which leads
to severe detection performance degradation. Unlike MTI,
space-time adaptive processing (STAP) separates the target and
clutter from a joint spatio-Doppler dimension, and exploits
significantly more degrees of freedom (DoFs) than MTI to
mitigate clutter while preserving target energy [1], [2].
Because of the large number of space-time DoFs, full rank
STAP techniques have a slow convergence and requires a
large number of independent and identically distributed (IID)
training snapshots (e.g., twice the system DoFs according
to the Reed-Mallett-Brennan rule [1], [2]), which is difficult
to satisfy in real scenarios, especially in nonhomogeneous
environments [1], [2]. For example, to ensure a loss less
than 3dB, it requires the ground with the range of 6 kilo-
meters to satisfy the homogeneity for a range resolution
of 30 meters (corresponding to a bandwidth of 5MHz), 10
antenna elements and 10 pulses. When the observation area
is the city or the sea, the above requirement is very dif-
ficult to be satisfied. Reduced-dimension and reduced-rank
methods [9]–[15], [17]–[29], [29]–[36], [38]–[40], [40]–[59].,
including the principle-components (PC) methods [3], joint-
domain localized approach [4], cross-spectral metric method
[5], multistage Wiener filter [6], auxiliary-vector filtering [7],
and joint interpolation, decimation and filtering algorithm

[60], have been developed to counteract the slow convergence
of full rank STAP. The parametric adaptive matched filter
(PAMF) based on a multichannel autoregressive model [61]
and sparse space-time beamformers exploiting the sparsity
of the received data and filter weights [62], [63] provide
alternative solutions to reduce the number of required IID
snapshots. Recently, knowledge-aided (KA) STAP techniques,
which aim at exploiting environmental knowledge, have been
developed to enhance the detection performance especially in
the case of nonhomogeneous environments (see, e.g., [64]–
[69] and the references therein). However, the exact form
of prior knowledge is still problem-dependent and hard to
derive. Moreover, how to effectively use the prior knowledge
remains a topic for further investigation. Direct data domain
least-squares (D3-LS) STAP approaches use only the received
data in the cell under test (CUT) and require no training
data, thereby avoiding estimation distortion caused by different
statistics of the training data [70], [71]. However, this benefit
comes at the cost of a reduced system DOFs resulting in
degraded performance.
More recently, motivated by compressive sensing tech-
niques, sparsity-based STAP has been applied to GMTD and
its basic idea is to formulate the observing scene with the target
and clutter [72]–[76], [78], [79], only the clutter [67], [79]–
[87] or only the target [79], [88]–[90] estimation problem as
a sparse recovery/representation (SR) problem or a low-rank
matrix estimation problem [84]. Compared with conventional
reduced-dimension and reduced-rank STAP algorithms, the
sparsity-based STAP algorithms provide high-resolution of the
scene and exhibit much better performance in a very small
training support, or even in a single snapshot. However, this
approach relies on the accuracy of the sparse model and
suffers performance degradation due to the model mismatches
caused by array errors or the intrinsic clutter motion (ICM)1. A
sparsity-based D3 STAP algorithm with the covariance matrix
taper (CMT) has been proposed to overcome the model mis-
matches caused by the ICM [78]. A sparsity-based STAP with
array gain/phase (GP) error self-calibration has been developed
in [87], which iteratively solves an SR problem and an LS
calibration problem. Since it requires to repeatedly recover
the scene in every iteration, the computational complexity is
high.
1One point worth mentioning is that standard STAP is relative robust
because these errors are captured in the adaptively estimated space-time
covariance matrix if assuming that they are constant over the coherent
processing interval and things are suitably narrowband. The only impact to
detection is a potential loss of the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) from steering vector mismatch.
2
In this paper, we focus on the GMTD using the sparsity-
based STAP in the presence of array GP errors. We first
build the sparse measurement model by taking array GP
errors into account. Under the framework of the alternating
direction method (ADM) [91], [92], we add a constraint to
the array GP errors, and transform the conventional sparsity-
based STAP problem into a joint optimization problem of the
spatio-Doppler profile and the array GP errors. Different from
the conventional sparsity-based STAP, the proposed algorithm
simultaneously estimates the spatio-Doppler profile and array
GP errors resulting in adaptation to practical situations. Unlike
the approach in [87], the proposed algorithm only requires the
recovery procedure once, leading to a reduced computational
complexity. Furthermore, we propose iterative approaches
to solve the above problem with both single snapshot and
multiple snapshots. A median constant false alarm (CFAR)
detector based on the reconstructed spatio-Doppler profiles is
developed for target detection. Finally, simulations are carried
out to illustrate the performance and computational complexity
of the proposed algorithm.
The work is organized as follows. Section II introduces the
STAP signal model in the presence of array GP errors for
airborne radar systems. Section III builds the sparse signal
model, and details the sparsity-based STAP using the ADM
framework. Simulated airborne radar data are used to evaluate
the performance of the proposed algorithm in Section IV.
Section V provides the summary and conclusions.

II. SIGNAL MODEL
The airborne radar system under consideration employs a
uniform linear array (ULA) consisting of M antenna elements
with half wavelength inner spacing da = λc/2 (where λc is the
carrier wavelength), as shown in Fig.1. Each element receives
N pulses in a coherent processing interval (CPI) with the pulse
repetition interval (PRI) of Tr. At the receiver, each antenna
element has its own low-noise amplifier (LNA), mixer and
AD converter (ADC). After these, all samples (NM ) from the
same CPI are combined for sequential processing. In general,
the target detection problem for airborne radar can be stated
in the context of binary hypothesis testing as given by
H0 : x = xu
H1 : x = xt + xu, (1)
where xt is the target component, xu is the disturbance
component, H0 and H1 denote target-absence and target-
presence, respectively. In reality, as the external environment
changes, such as temperature and humidity, the consistency of
the amplifiers of the array multi-channel receivers is hard to
keep. This inconsistency of the amplifiers is usually modeled
as the array GP errors [2]. Hence, for a point target, xt can
be written as
xt = αtvd(f
t
d)⊗
(
c⊙ vs(f
t
s)
)
= αtCv(f
t
d, f

where c = [c1, · · · , cM ]
T is the M × 1 array GP error
vector, C = IN ⊗ diag(c), IN is an identity matrix of size
N , vd(f
t
d) denotes the N × 1 temporal steering vector at
the target Doppler frequency f td, vs(f
t

steering vector in the direction provided by the target spatial
frequency f ts , and v(f
t
d, f
t
s) = vd(f
t
d)⊗ vs(f
t
s) is the space-
time steering vector without array GP error. For the ULA, the
steering vectors vs(f
t

t
d) are given by
vs(f
t
s) = [1, exp

The disturbance vector xu is composed of the clutter compo-
nent xc and the thermal noise component n, i.e., xu = xc+n.
It is usually assumed that the clutter can be adequately
approximated by a summation of individual clutter patches
over the iso-range of interest, given by
xc =
Nc
∑
k=1
αc,kvd(f

)
= C
Nc
∑
k=1
αc,kv(f
c
d,k, f
c
s,k),
(5)
where Nc denotes the number of independent clutter patches,
αc,k is the random complex amplitude of the kth clutter patch,
and f cs,k and f
c
d,k are the spatial and Doppler frequencies,
respectively, of the kth clutter patch. Moreover, it is assumed
that the clutter amplitudes αc,k, k = 1, 2, · · · , Nc, are IID
mean-zero complex Gaussian random variables with variance
σ2c,k. Hence, the corresponding clutter covariance matrix can
be represented by
Rc = C

σ2c,kv(f
c
d,k, f
c
s,k)v
H(f cd,k, f
c
s,k)C
H . (6)
Additionally, we assume that the clutter spectral characteristics
follow the local homogeneity. In the following, we will use
this local homogeneity to estimate the clutter-plus-noise power
level for target detection. Since the thermal noise comes from
the receiver electronics and is added to the return after it passes
through the antenna array, it is not affected by the array errors.
Here, we assume the thermal noise n is independent from
element to element and from pulse to pulse and follows the
zero-mean Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix Rn =
σ2nINM .
III. PROPOSED SPARSITY-BASED STAP IN THE PRESENCE
OF ARRAY GP ERRORS

the presence of array GP errors, and then detail the sparsity-
based STAP algorithm under the framework of ADM.

A. Sparse Signal Model
One notes that the clutter return in (5) is a function of the
Doppler frequency and spatial frequency. Let us discretize the
whole spatio-Doppler plane into a large number of grid points
(where Ns = ρsM , Nd = ρdN , ρs, ρd > 1, Ns and Nd are the
discretized number of grid points along the spatial and Doppler
frequencies, respectively) [72]. A nonzero element from any
such grid point would suggest the presence of a scatterer at
that particular spatial and Doppler frequencies. We denote the
discretized spatial and Doppler frequencies of all grid points as
Ψ = {(fd,1, fs,1), (fd,1, fs,2), · · · , (fd,Nd , fs,Ns)}. Therefore,
the spatial and Doppler frequencies of the Nc clutter patches
can be seen as a subset of Ψ, termed as Ψc. Hence, similar to
(5), the clutter return can be expressed by
xc = CΦαc, (7)
where αc = [α1,1, α1,2, · · · , αNd,Ns ]
T denotes the NdNs × 1
spatio-Doppler profile with nonzero elements representing the
clutter, and the NM × NdNs matrix Φ is the over-complete
space-time steering dictionary, as given by
Φ = [v(fd,1, fs,1),v(fd,1, fs,2), · · · ,v(fd,Nd , fs,Ns)], (8)
The clutter sparsity can be understood from the following
two points: (a) it is well known that, the relationship between
the Doppler frequency and the spatial frequency is a one-to-
one mapping. For example, the shapes of the clutter ridge
are straight lines for the side-looking ULA. Compared with
the whole discretized place (corresponding to the size of the
set Ψ), the number of the nonzero elements in the spatio-
Doppler profile occupied by the clutter (corresponding to
the size of the subset Ψc) is quite small. (b) It is proved
that for the case of side-looking radar with a ULA, constant
PRF, constant platform velocity and no crab angle, there is
a group of space-time steering vectors (whose number is
equivalent to the clutter rank) that can approximately represent
the clutter subspace [81]. That is to say the clutter sparsity
is much lower than the system DoFs and far lower than
NdNs (since the clutter rank is much lower than NM and
NM ≫ NdNs). Similar conclusions are also obtained by
L. Bai [77]. Moreover, according to [8], the clutter rank can
be estimated by counting the number of resolution grids that
are occupied by the significant clutter spectrum components.
Therefore, there is a high degree of sparsity of the clutter in
the spatio-Doppler profile.
When a target is present in the CUT, corresponding to H1
hypothesis, the target’s return is just like the response of a
nonzero element in the spatio-Doppler profile. If we assume
the target’s spatial and Doppler frequencies are from the grid
points Ψ, then, the target return can be written as
xt = CΦαt, (9)
where αt denotes the target amplitude. Thus, the total return
in the presence of target can be represented by
x = xt + xc + n = CΦα+ n, (10)
where α = αt + αc represent the amplitudes from both the
clutter and the target. Because of the limitation of the number
of targets, it results in sparsity of the spatio-Doppler profile.
B. Problem Formulation via the Framework of ADM
For simplicity and convenience, we rewrite the expression
of (10) as
Tx = Φα+ n′. (11)
where T = IN ⊗ diag(t), t = [t1, · · · , tM ]
T tm = c
−1
m , 1 ≤
m ≤ M , and n′ = Tn. Here, we assume that the unknown
array GP errors are nonzeros. Exploiting the sparsity of α,
the spatio-Doppler profile can be approximately estimated by
4
solving the so-called basis pursuit denoising (BPDN) problem,
described by
min
α
‖α‖1 +
1
2ρ
‖Tx −Φα‖
2
2 , (12)
where ρ > 0 is the positive regularization parameter that
provides a trade-off between the sparsity and total squared
error. With an auxiliary variable r = Tx − Φα, the above
BPDN problem can be reformulated as
min
α,r
‖α‖1 +
1
2ρ
‖r‖
2
2
s.t. Φα+ r = Tx
(13)
Then, the augmented Lagrangian function of this problem
is given by [91], [92]
min
α,r,λ,t
L′ (α, r,λ, t) = min
α,r,λ,t

{
λ
H (Φα+ r−Tx)
}
+
β
2
‖Φα+ r−Tx‖
2
2
(14)
where λ ∈ CNM is a Lagrange multiplier and β > 0 is a
penalty parameter. Note that the matrix T of (14) depends on
the array GP error vector c (t), which is unknown and should
be estimated from the data. Given the snapshot x and the
over-complete space-time steering dictionary Φ, we can obtain
the spatio-Doppler profile α, the auxiliary variable r and the
array GP error vector c by applying alternating minimization
to solve (14).
With the above formulation, we observe that the problem
(14) is an unconstrained convex optimization problem. How-
ever, it is trivially satisfied for zeros of vectors t and α. To
avoid this trivial solution, we introduce a convex normalization
constraint
∑M
m=1 tm = ς , where ς ∈ C is an arbitrary constant
scale. Therefore, the cost function L′ (α, r,λ, t) in problem
(14) can be rewritten as
L (α, r,λ, t) = ‖α‖1 +
1

}
+
β
2
‖Φα+ r−Tx‖
2
2
(15)
where γ is a Lagrange multiplier. The actual array GP error
vector is recovered after the optimization using cm = 1/tm,
m = 1, · · · ,M . One should also note that the estimated array
GP error vector scales to the true one because of the constant
scale ς in the constraint.
C. Jointly Iterative Estimation of the Spatio-Doppler Profile
and Array GP Error
In this subsection, we estimate the spatio-Doppler profile
and array GP error vector iteratively. For α = αp, λ = λp,
and t = tp fixed (()p denotes the pth iteration), the minimizer
of (15) with respect to r∗ is given by
rp+1 =
ρβ
1 + ρβ
(
λ
p
β
−Φαp +Tpx
)
. (16)
Similarly, for r = rp+1, λ = λp, and t = tp fixed, the
minimization of (15) with respect to α∗ is equivalent to
min
α
‖α‖1 +
β

Φα+ rp+1 −Tpx−
λ

2
2
. (17)
Then, the solution of the problem (17) can be approximately
given by [91], [92]
α
p+1 = soft
(
α
p − τgp,
τ
β
)

α
p − τgp
|αp − τgp|
,
(18)
where all the operations in (18) are performed component-wise
(usually known as shrinkage), 00 = 0, τ > 0 is a proximal
parameter and
gp = ΦH
(
Φαp + rp+1 −Tpx−
λ
p
β
)
. (19)
Given r = rp+1, λ = λp and α = αp+1, the minimization
of (15) with respect to t∗ can be simplified as
min

For simplicity, we denote zp = Φαp+1+rp+1− λ
p
β
, Tx = Qt
and Q = diag(x)(1N ⊗IM ). Then, (28) can be rewritten with
the form of

p −Qt‖
2
2 −ℜ
{
γ∗
(
∑M
m=1 tm − ς
)}
. (21)
By taking the gradient of the cost function in problem (21)
with respect to t∗ and γ∗, equating the terms to zero, and
solving for t, we obtain (the detailed derivations are given in
Appendix A)
tp+1 =
[
b1 + γ
a1
,
b2 + γ
a2
, · · · ,
bM + γ
aM
]T
, (22)
where bm, am and γ, (m = 1, 2, · · · ,M ) are defined by (41),
(42) and (43) in Appendix A.
Finally, minimizing (15) with respect to λ
∗
, we obtain the
update of the multiplier λ as
λ
p+1 = λp − β
(
Φαp+1 + rp+1 −Tp+1x
)
. (23)
In short, the proposed approach iteratively updates (16),
(18), (22) and (23) to obtain estimates of the spatio-Doppler
profile and array GP error vector.
D. Application to Multiple Snapshots
It is reasonable to suppose that the array GP errors are
identical for different snapshots from adjacent range bins in
the same CPI. By using multiple snapshots, we can expect
to improve the accuracy of the estimated array GP errors
and spatio-Doppler profiles. In the following, we apply the
proposed ADM algorithm to the multiple snapshots case. For
5
L snapshots, xl, l = 1, 2, · · · , L, the problem of (15) can be
reformulated as
min

,
(24)
where αl, rl and λl denote the corresponding variables of the
lth snapshot.
Let us define Υ = [α1,α2, · · · ,αL], Γ = [r1, r2, · · · , rL],
Λ = [λ1,λ2, · · · ,λL], and X = [x1,x2, · · · ,xL]. Similar to
the derivations in the previous subsection, we can subsequently
obtain the updates of Υ, Γ and Λ as
Γp+1 =

where
Gp = ΦH

E. Target Detection
Since the main purpose of this paper is to improve the
spatio-Doppler profiles’ estimation by using the joint estima-
tion approach, in this subsection, we only consider using a
simple detector for illustration purposes. Furthermore, follow-
ing the ideas in [74], we focus on target detection based on the
estimated spatio-Doppler profiles. It is reasonable to assume
that the reconstructed clutter peaks at a few (say, 10) adjacent
range bins are nearly the same, and the target peaks are not so
“dense” in range [74]. Therefore, as shown in Fig.2, we first
exclude some snapshots around the CUT (namely the guard
cells) for avoiding target canceling, and then perform a moving
test window to the estimated spatio-Doppler profile α̂CUT
at the CUT with the size of a spatio-Doppler resolution cell
(i.e., 1/N and 1/M for the Doppler and spatial frequencies,
respectively). When we conduct the detection procedure, we
should determine the presence/absence of the target for every
single angle and every single Doppler frequency. Since the
airborne radar transmitter usually keeps a high gain in the
observing angle for a CPI, we only require to conduct the
detection procedure by fixing the spatial frequency of detection
to the main-lobe f t0s and varying the Doppler frequency within
a set of possible values. Specifically, for a possible target
Doppler frequency f td, the range of the moving test window
is (f td − 1/2N, f
t
d + 1/2N) and (f
t0
s − 1/2M, f
t0
s + 1/2M).
Then, we pick out the elements that belong to the moving
test window from α̂CUT, and arrange them into a new vector
α̃CUT, as given by
α̃CUT =
{
α̂CUT,k,i

,
fs,i ∈
(
f t0s −
1

, f t0s +

)}
,
(34)
Similarly, for the same moving test window, we form L
secondary samples α̃l, l = 1, 2, · · · , L, by
α̃l =
{
α̂l,k,i

IV. PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
In this section, we evaluate the performance of the proposed
JIE-ADM algorithm in terms of qualities of the reconstructed
spatio-Doppler profiles and the probability of detection (PD)
using simulated data. For comparison purposes, we also
show the performance of the proposed JIE-ADM algorithm,
conventional D3-LS STAP [70], ADM [91], basis pursuit
using interior-point method (BP-IPM) [94], and IAA [74]
and ADMT (using the ADM reconstructs the spatio-Doppler
profile with the known array GP errors).
The parameters of the simulated radar platform are shown in
Table II. In addition, for each range bin, the [−π/2, π/2] AOA
interval was divided into 361 clutter patches, whose single
channel, single pulse clutter-to-noise ratio (CNR) is 30dB. The
thermal noise power for each channel and each pulse is set
to unit. The gain error and phase error are both assumed to
follow a uniform distribution [68], [87]. Specifically, we can
denote the mth entry of the array GP error vector as cm =
(1 + ǫm)e
jφm , m = 1, 2, · · · ,M , where ǫm and φm follow a

and ADM algorithms, β = 0.1, ρ = 0.01, ζ = 10−4 and
the maximum iteration number 500. For the BP-IPM, the
noise allowance parameter is set to 10−3 and the maximum
iteration number 500. For the IAA, the stopping criterion is
decided by both the preset limit relative change of the solutions
between two adjacent iterations 10−4 and the maximum iter-
ation number 20. Moreover, the whole spatio-Doppler plane
is discretized into Nd × Ns = 5N × 5M grid points for all
algorithms.

In the first example, we focus on the spatio-Doppler profile
reconstructions considering different cases of array GP errors:
case 1, no array GP error, i.e., ǫmax = 0 and φmax = 0;
case 2, ǫmax = 0.05 and φmax = 0.05π; case 3, ǫmax = 0.1
and φmax = 0.1π. In addition, we assume that there are three
targets in the boresight at the range bin of interest: target 1
with the normalized Doppler frequency equal to −0.13 and the
input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) set to 0.2dB; target 2 with the
normalized Doppler frequency equal to 0.11 and the target’s
input SNR set to −3.8dB; and target 3 with the normalized
Doppler frequency equal to 0.41 and the target’s input SNR
set to −3.8dB. Here, we set a larger target’s input SNR for
target 1 because it stands for a slow target and is not well
recovered when in small input SNR. As shown in Fig.??, we
see that the spatio-Doppler profiles can be well reconstructed
for the ADMT when the array GP errors are known. It is
also observed that more and more pseudo peaks are present
in the spatio-Doppler profiles using the ADM, BP-IPM and
IAA algorithms, as the increase of the array GP errors. On
the contrary, the spatio-Doppler profiles using the proposed
JIE-ADM algorithm keep nearly the same qualities as those
using the ADMT.
To better illustrate the performance of the proposed algo-
rithm, we conduct simulations with a large number of pulses
(i.e., 100). The reconstructed spatio-Doppler profiles with
array GP errors ǫmax = 0.1 and φmax = 0.1π are shown
in Fig.3. The whole spatio-Doppler plane is discretized into
Nd×Ns = 2N×5M grid points. Other parameters are same as
those of the first example. From the images, we note that the
reconstructed spatio-Doppler profiles of all considered algo-
rithms show better performance than those when transmitting
a small number of pulses (i.e., 10) in Fig.??. Again, we still
note that the proposed algorithm exhibits similar performance
with the ADMT, and much better quality than the ADM, BP-
IPM and IAA algorithms. This illustrates that the proposed
algorithm outperforms other algorithms, which are without
array GP errors estimation, when the target is at a low speed.
Additionally, one should note that the fine characteristics of
clutter spectrum are important for the sparsity-based STAP
algorithms. Specifically, it might have different influences on
different algorithms.
In the second example, we assess the detection performance
of the proposed algorithm. The false alarm rate Pfa is set to
10−3, and the target is in the boresight with the normalized
Doppler frequency 0.36. First, in Fig.4, we show the impacts
of array GP errors on the detection performance of the
conventional D3-LS STAP and the existing SR algorithms,
i.e., ADM, BP-IPM and IAA. In the figure, AMF-Optimum
represents the detector of the adaptive matched filter (AMF)
with clairvoyant knowledge of the space-time covariance ma-
trix of the interference as well as the space-time steering
vector of the target (including any “errors”). The results in
Fig.4 illustrate that: (1) the detection performance of the
existing SR algorithms are better than that of the conventional
D3-LS STAP when there are no array GP error, which are
coincident with conclusions in [76], [78]; and (2) the detection
performance of the conventional D3-LS STAP and the existing
SR algorithms are significantly degraded in the presence of

ǫmax = 0.05 and φmax = 0.05π; case 4, ǫmax = 0.1 and φmax = 0.1π;
case 5, ǫmax = 0.15 and φmax = 0.15π; and case 6, ǫmax = 0.2 and
φmax = 0.2π.
the array GP errors, and the proposed method achieves the
best detection performance. Additionally, the performance of
a typical statistical STAP method, i.e., PC, with AMF, (namely,
AMF-PC) is also shown in Fig.4. The rank and the number
of training snapshots used for the AMF-PC are set to 28 and
60, respectively. It illustrates that the AMF-PC is not sensitive
to the array GP errors. However, statistical STAP methods
require significantly more training snapshots than the sparsity-
based STAP. Furthermore, in the following simulations, when
the array GP errors increase, the performance of AMF-PC
becomes worse than the proposed algorithm (see Fig.6).
Next, we show the detection performance of the proposed
JIE-ADM algorithm and ADMT against the input SNR in
Fig.5. Here, we consider six different cases of GP errors:
case 1, no array GP error; case 2, ǫmax = 0.025 and
φmax = 0.025π; case 3, ǫmax = 0.05 and φmax = 0.05π;
case 4, ǫmax = 0.1 and φmax = 0.1π; case 5, ǫmax = 0.15 and
φmax = 0.15π; and case 6, ǫmax = 0.2 and φmax = 0.2π. It is
seen from Figs.4 and 5 that the proposed JIE-ADM algorithm
provides slightly worse performance than the ADMT, but
is more robust to the array GP errors and obtains much

better performance than the conventional D3-LS STAP and
existing SR algorithms. This is because the proposed JIE-
ADM algorithm provides more accurate estimate of the spatio-
Doppler profile and is much more robust to the array GP errors.
To further investigate the performance of the proposed
JIE-ADM algorithm, in Fig.6, we examine the detection
performance with different Doppler frequencies at a level
of array GP errors ǫmax = 0.1 and φmax = 0.1π, by
showing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curvers.
Here, slow, median speed and relative fast moving targets are
simulated with the normalized Doppler frequencies of 0.13,
0.23 and 0.36, respectively. The corresponding input target’s
SNRs are fixed to 0.2dB, −3.8dB and −3.8dB, respectively.
The results in Fig.6 highlight that the proposed JIE-ADM
algorithm considerably outperforms the conventional D3-LS
STAP and existing SR algorithms in presence of array GP
errors regardless of the detection of the slow, median speed
or relative fast moving targets. It should be pointed out that
the detection performance of the proposed algorithm degrades
for the slow moving target. This can be roughly understood
from Fig.?? that the difficulty to separate the target and the
clutter increases when the target is close to the clutter ridge.
As the target’s input SNR increases, the detection performance
improves.
Fig.7 plots the average running time of the sparsity-based
STAP algorithms versus sizes of dictionary for estimating one
spatio-Doppler profile. Here, the simulations are operated on
a standard desktop computer with a 3.6GHz CPU (dual core
with Matlab’s multithreading option enabled) and 4GB of
memory. The size of one CPI is changed from 16 to 144,
corresponding to the number of columns of the dictionary
from 400 to 3600. The curves indicate that the computational
complexity of the proposed JIE-ADM algorithm is close to that
of the ADM and ADMT algorithms. That is to say, the added
array GP errors estimation step of the proposed algorithm costs
very little, which can be also concluded from the estimation
equations, i.e., (40), (41), (42) and (43).
V. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, a novel sparsity-based STAP algorithm has
been presented for airborne radar. In order to avoid the
performance degradation caused by array errors, the proposed
algorithm reformulated the sparsity-based STAP as a joint
optimization of the spatio-Doppler profile and array errors
by employing the framework of ADM. By solving the above
problem iteratively, we developed a median CFAR detector
using the reconstructed spatio-Doppler profiles. The perfor-
mance of the proposed algorithm was tested and compared
with that of the conventional D3-LS STAP and other existing
sparsity-based STAP algorithms. Results show that the pro-
posed algorithm is robust to array errors and yields significant
improvement in detection performance over the conventional
D3-LS STAP and other existing sparsity-based STAP algo-
rithms. Additionally, the proposed algorithm adds very little
computational complexity compared with the ADM without
array error estimation. In our future work, we will investigate
fast sparsity-based STAP algorithms with jointly estimating the
spatio-Doppler profile and array errors. Moreover, the detector
design based on the spatio-Doppler profiles and its statistics
will be considered and analyzed.
