Two Raster Display Devices (CRT and LCD)
Graphics Card Selection 
 Graphics card is as important as the CPU, RAM and 
hard drive for CAD, video, or graphics applications;
 The default graphics cards (GPU) listed by the 
computer manufacturer is mainly for regular business 
applications or video gaming, and is not appropriate 
for heavy graphics usage;
 Low-cost (under $200) graphics cards or cards from 
unknown manufacture do not provide full OpenGL 
support that is required by CAD or graphics 
applications, affecting the performance and stability of 
the CAD and graphics application;
 CAD software vendors normally provide a constantly 
updated list of tested graphics cards and drivers.

Flat Panel Display (FPD)Technology
 LCD (Liquid-Crystal Display) 
 Plasma Display
 DLP™ (Digital Light Processing™) 
 Organic LED or OLED (Organic Light-emitting Diode)
Future Display Technologies – 3D Display 
9
Notes:
Plasma will outperform LCD by providing lots of  dark and better contrast, 
but LCD outperforms plasma in brightness and color. 
Cost of  Plasma for larger size screen is lower, but it suffers from burn-in.
DLP shows its advantage for very large projection screens.
OLED represents future FPD technology.
Gas-Plasma Display
10
Plasma display employs neon and xenon gases which are 
trapped between two thin layers of  glass to create a digital 
image. 
A small electric pulse is applied to each pixel to excite the 
gases to produce the color information and light. 
These rare gases actually have a life and fade over time. The 
life of  these phosphors is around 25,000 to 30,000 hours (not 
replaceable). 
LCD (Liquid-Crystal Display)
 A matrix of thin-film transistors (TFTs) supplies voltage to liquid crystal-
filled cells sandwiched between two sheets of glass.
 A trio of red, green, and blue cells make up one pixel.
11
 When hit with an electrical charge, the 
crystals "untwist" to an exact degree to 
filter light generated by 
 fluorescent or LED array backlight behind 
the screen (for flat-panel LCDs) 
 LCD has an expected life between 50,000 
and 75,000 hours, as long as the 
backlight (often replaceable)
 (first appeared in calculators in 1970s 
reflected light from back mirror)
DLP™ (Digital Light Processing™)
12Computer-Aided Design
 A semiconductor-based display, 
from Texas Instruments (1993) 
 A panel of micromirrors are 
mounted on tiny hinges that 
enable them to tilt either toward 
or away from the light source in 
a DLP™ projection system 
(ON/OFF) - creating a light or 
dark pixel on the projection 
surface. 
 The white light generated by the 
lamp in a DLP projection system 
passes through a color wheel as 
it travels to the surface of the 
DMD panel - 1-chip system
 3-chip DLP™ projection system 
has three light sources (RGB) 
and no color wheel. 
Light Valve Display
13
Organic Light-emitting Diode (OLED),
 OLED, also Light Emitting Polymer (LEP) 
 The whole display can be built on one sheet of glass or plastic with a 
light emitting layer (rigid or flexible)
 The light emitting layer contains a polymer substance on which a layer 
of organic compounds are deposited/printed.  
 It provides better performance at lower costs and use much less 
power.
 It displays full-color, video-rate imagery with much faster response 
times, wider viewing angles, and brighter, more saturated colors. 
14
Key Technical Terms
 Traditional
 Refresh Rate of CRTs is refers to how often the screen is redrawn per 
second. With low refresh rates you can get screen flicker and eye strain. Aim 
for a rate of 75 Hz for a monitor up to 17 inches in size and 85 Hz for any 
larger monitor. 
 LCDs are basically flicker free so refresh rates are not as important. 
 Dot Pitch is the distance in millimeters between phosphors of the same color. 
The smaller the dot pitch, the sharper the image. Opt for a dot pitch of 0.26 
mm or smaller (usually quote horizontal dot pitch). 
 New
 Brightness: LCD monitors have several backlights that provide 
illumination. Brightness is measured in units called nits. The majority of 
LCDs produce 150-200 nits which is fine for most users. The backlights in 
a LCD are good for 10 to 50 thousand hours of operation.
 Native Resolution (Display Capability of the Hardware)
 Dynamic Contrast Ratio (and True Contrast Ratio)
 Response Time (Better LCD TVs operate at 120 Hz refresh rate for fast 
moving objects)

Stereoscopic Technology (3D Display)
Common 3D display technology for projecting stereoscopic 
image pairs to the viewer include:
 Anaglyphic 3D (with passive red-cyan glasses)
 Polarization 3D (with passive polarized glasses)
 Alternate-frame sequencing (with active shutter 
glasses/headgear)
 Autostereoscopic displays (without glasses/headgear)
19
Anaglyphic 3D 
Anaglyph images are used to provide a stereoscopic 3D effect,
when viewed with 2 color glasses (each lens a chromatically
opposite color, usually red and cyan). Images are made up of two
color layers, superimposed, but offset with respect to each other
to produce a depth effect.
Colour rendering is not very accurate with this method.
20
Anaglyphic 3D 
 A pair of eyeglasses with two filters of the same colors, once used on 
the cameras (or now simulated by image processing software 
manipulations) is worn by the viewer. In the case above, the red lens 
over the left eye allows only the red part of the anaglyph image through 
to that eye, while the cyan (blue/green) lens over the right eye allows 
only the blue and green parts of the image through to that eye. Portions 
of the image that are red will appear dark through the cyan filter, while 
portions of colors composed only of green and blue will appear dark 
through the red filter. Each eye therefore sees only the perspective it is 
supposed to see.
21
Polarization 3D 
Polarized 3D glasses create the illusion of three-dimensional
images by restricting the light that reaches each eye.
Light reflected from a motion picture screen tends to lose a bit of its polarization, but this
problem is eliminated if a silver screen or aluminized screen is used.
o A pair of aligned DLP projectors, some polarizing filters, a silver
screen, and a computer with a dual-head graphics card can be
used to form system for displaying stereoscopic 3D data
simultaneously to a group of people wearing polarized glasses.
o In the case of RealD a circularly polarizing liquid crystal filter
which can switch polarity many times per second is placed on
front of the projector lens. Only one projector is needed, as the
left and right eye images are displayed alternately.
o Polarized images can be obtained also on TVs with the use of a polarized screen.

Linear Circular Elliptical
Alternate-Frame Sequencing  (Eclipse Method)
 With the eclipse method, a mechanical shutter blocks light from 
each appropriate eye when the converse eye's image is projected 
on the screen. The projector alternates between left and right 
images, and opens and closes the shutters in the glasses or 
viewer in synchronization with the images on the screen.
 A variation on the eclipse method is used in LCD shutter glasses. 
Glasses containing liquid crystal that will let light through in 
synchronization with the images on the computer display or TV, 
using the concept of alternate-frame sequencing.
24
Autostereoscopic displays (without glasses/headgear)
 Lenticular screens. 
Both images are projected onto a high-gain, corrugated screen which 
reflects light at acute angles. In order to see the stereoscopic image, the 
viewer must sit within a very narrow angle that is nearly perpendicular to 
the screen, limiting the size of the audience.
25
Autostereoscopic displays (without glasses/headgear)
 Parallax Barrier
Placed in front of the normal LCD, it consists of a layer of material with a 
series of precision slits, allowing each eye to see a different set of pixels, 
so creating a sense of depth through parallax. A disadvantage of the 
technology is that the viewer must be positioned in a well defined spot to 
experience the 3D effect.

Graphical Input Devices: Touch Screen
 Resistive:
A resistive touchscreen panel is composed of several layers, the most 
important of which are two thin, electrically conductive layers separated 
by a narrow gap. When an object, such as a finger, presses down on a 
point on the panel's outer surface the two metallic layers become 
connected at that point.This causes a change in the electrical current, 
which is registered as a touch event and sent to the controller for 
processing.
35
Graphical Input Devices: Touch Screen
 Capacitive
A capacitive touchscreen panel is one which consists of an insulator 
such as glass, coated with a transparent conductor such as indium tin 
oxide (ITO). As the human body is also a conductor, touching the 
surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen's electrostatic 
field, measurable as a change in capacitance. Different technologies 
may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location is 
then sent to the controller for processing.
