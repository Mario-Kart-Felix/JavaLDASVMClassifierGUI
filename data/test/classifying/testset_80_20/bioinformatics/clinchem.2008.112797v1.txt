BACKGROUND: Currently, a lack of consensus exists on
how best to perform and interpret quantitative real-
time PCR (qPCR) experiments. The problem is exac-
erbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in
many publications, which impedes a reader’s ability to
evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or
to repeat the experiments.
CONTENT: The Minimum Information for Publication
of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE)
guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure
the integrity of the scientific literature, promote con-
sistency between laboratories, and increase experimen-
tal transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that de-
scribe the minimum information necessary for
evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to
accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to
the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental
conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can as-
sess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of
all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is neces-
sary to enable other investigators to reproduce results.
MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated
form or as an online supplement.
SUMMARY: Following these guidelines will encourage
better experimental practice, allowing more reliable
and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.

The fluorescence-based quantitative real-time PCR
(qPCR)15 (1–3 ), with its capacity to detect and mea-
sure minute amounts of nucleic acids in a wide range of
samples from numerous sources, is the enabling tech-
nology par excellence of molecular diagnostics, life sci-
ences, agriculture, and medicine (4, 5 ). Its conceptual
and practical simplicity, together with its combination
of speed, sensitivity, and specificity in a homogeneous
assay, have made it the touchstone for nucleic acid
quantification. In addition to its use as a research tool,
many diagnostic applications have been developed, in-
cluding microbial quantification, gene dosage determi-
nation, identification of transgenes in genetically mod-
ified foods, risk assessment of cancer recurrence, and
applications for forensic use (6 –11 ).
This popularity is reflected in the prodigious
number of publications reporting qPCR data, which
invariably use diverse reagents, protocols, analysis
methods, and reporting formats. This remarkable
lack of consensus on how best to perform qPCR ex-
periments has the adverse consequence of perpetu-
ating a string of serious shortcomings that encumber
its status as an independent yardstick (12 ). Techni-
cal deficiencies that affect assay performance include
the following: (a) inadequate sample storage, prep-
aration, and nucleic acid quality, yielding highly
variable results; (b) poor choice of reverse-transcription
primers and primers and probes for the PCR, leading to
inefficient and less-than-robust assay performance;

and (c) inappropriate data and statistical analyses, gen-
erating results that can be highly misleading. Conse-
quently, there is the real danger of the scientific litera-
ture being corrupted with a multitude of publications
reporting statistically insignificant and conflicting re-
sults ( 13 ). The publication (14 ) and retraction (15 ) of
a Science “Breakthrough of the Year 2005” report pro-
vides a disquieting warning. The problem is exacer-
bated by the lack of information that characterizes
most reports of studies that have used this technol-
ogy, with many publications not providing sufficient
experimental detail to permit the reader to critically
evaluate the quality of the results presented or to
repeat the experiments. Specifically, information
about sample acquisition and handling, RNA quality
and integrity, reverse-transcription details, PCR ef-
ficiencies, and analysis parameters are frequently
omitted, whereas sample normalization is habitually
carried out against single reference genes without
adequate justification.
The aim of this document is to provide authors,
reviewers, and editors specifications for the minimum
information, set out in Table 1, that must be reported
for a qPCR experiment to ensure its relevance, accu-
racy, correct interpretation, and repeatability. MIQE
(Minimum Information for Publication of Quantita-
tive Real-Time PCR Experiments, pronounced mykee)
is modeled on similar guidelines drawn up for DNA
microarray analysis (16 ), proteomics experiments
(17 ), genome sequence specification (18 ), and those
under discussion for RNA interference work (19, 20 )
and metabolomics (21 ), all of which are initiatives co-
ordinated under the umbrella of MIBBI (Minimum
Information for Biological and Biomedical Investiga-
tions, http://www.mibbi.org) (22 ). Compulsory inclu-
sion of a common reporting language to allow data
sharing is not proposed, although it is envisaged that a
future update of these guidelines could include such a
recommendation. Rather, these guidelines target the
reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the
scientific literature, promote consistency between lab-
oratories, and increase experimental transparency.
They should be read in conjunction with recent publi-
cations that deal in depth with the issue of qPCR stan-
dardization (23–26 ).
1. Nomenclature
A few terms require standardization to ensure
clarification:
1.1 We propose that the abbreviation qPCR be used
for quantitative real-time PCR and that RT-qPCR
be used for reverse transcription– qPCR. Applying
the abbreviation RT-PCR to qPCR causes confu-
sion and is inconsistent with its use for conven-
tional (legacy) reverse transcription–PCR.
1.2 Genes used for normalization should be referred to
as reference genes, not as housekeeping genes.
1.3 TaqMan probes should be referred to as hydrolysis
probes.
1.4 The term FRET probe (fluorescence resonance en-
ergy transfer probe) refers to a generic mechanism
in which emission/quenching relies on the interac-
tion between the electron-excitation states of 2 flu-
orescent dye molecules. LightCycler-type probes
should be referred to as dual hybridization probes.
1.5 The Oxford English Dictionary lists only quantifica-
tion, not quantitation; therefore, the former is the
proper word.
1.6 The nomenclature describing the fractional PCR
cycle used for quantification is inconsistent, with
threshold cycle (Ct), crossing point (Cp), and take-off
point (TOP) currently used in the literature. These
terms all refer to the same value from the real-time
instrument and were coined by competing manu-
facturers of real-time instruments for reasons of
product differentiation, not scientific accuracy or
clarity. We propose the use of quantification cycle
(Cq), according to the RDML (Real-Time PCR
Data Markup Language) data standard (http://
www.rdml.org) (27 ).
2. Conceptual Considerations
To explain and justify the guidelines, we find it useful
to review a number of key issues surrounding qPCR
experiments:
2.1 Analytical sensitivity refers to the minimum num-
ber of copies in a sample that can be measured
accurately with an assay, whereas clinical sensitivity
is the percentage of individuals with a given disor-
der whom the assay identifies as positive for that
condition. Typically, sensitivity is expressed as the
limit of detection (LOD), which is the concentra-
tion that can be detected with reasonable certainty
(95% probability is commonly used) with a given
analytical procedure. The most sensitive LOD the-
oretically possible is 3 copies per PCR (28 ), assum-
ing a Poisson distribution, a 95% chance of includ-
ing at least 1 copy in the PCR, and single-copy
detection. Experimental procedures typically in-
clude sample-processing steps (i.e., extraction)
and, when required, reverse transcription. If the
volume changes and the efficiencies of these steps
are accounted for, the most sensitive LOD theoret-
ically possible can be expressed in units relevant to
the experiment, such as copies per nanogram of
tissue. Experimental results less than the theoreti-

MIQE Guidelines for qPCR Reviews

cally possible LOD should never be reported. It
also follows that results of “0” are meaningless and
misleading. LOD estimates in qPCR analyses are
complicated by the logarithmic nature of Cq, be-
cause Cq is undefined when the template concen-
tration is zero. Appropriate determination and
modeling of the LOD in the qPCR is the focus of
continued research (26 ).
2.2 Analytical specificity refers to the qPCR assay de-
tecting the appropriate target sequence rather than
other, nonspecific targets also present in a sample.
Diagnostic specificity is the percentage of individu-
als without a given condition whom the assay iden-
tifies as negative for that condition.
2.3 Accuracy refers to the difference between experi-
mentally measured and actual concentrations,
presented as fold changes or copy number
estimates.
2.4 Repeatability (short-term precision or intraassay
variance) refers to the precision and robustness of
the assay with the same samples repeatedly ana-
lyzed in the same assay. It may be expressed as the
SD for the Cq variance. Alternatively, the SD or the
CV for copy number or concentration variance
may be used. CVs should not be used with Cqs,
however (29 ).
2.5 Reproducibility (long-term precision or interas-
say variance) refers to the variation in results
between runs or between different laboratories
and is typically expressed as the SD or CV of
copy numbers or concentrations. Cq values gen-
erated from different runs are subject to inher-
ent interrun variation (30 ); hence, reporting in-
terrun Cq variation is not appropriate.
Publications describing mRNA concentrations for
target genes should make it clear precisely what the
targets are. The transcripts of most human genes and
many genes in other multicellular organisms are alter-
natively spliced (31, 32 ), and these splicing variants
specify alternative protein isoforms, with variation in
splicing patterns reported in different tissues or at dif-
ferent developmental stages. Consequently, single
exon– based RT-qPCR assays may detect a number of
splice variants, whereas intron-spanning primers may
be more selective but may miss some splice variants
altogether. Most recently, autosomal nonimprinted
genes that display allelic imbalance in their expression
have been described (33 ). Taken together, these find-
ings imply that use of an RT-qPCR assay that simply
targets one or at most 2 exons of an mRNA is no longer
sufficient to describe the expression level of a particular
gene. Consequently, sequence information for primers
must be provided together with an assessment of their
specificity with respect to known splice variants and
single-nucleotide polymorphism positions docu-
mented in transcript and single-nucleotide polymor-
phism databases. For primer sets selected from the
RTprimerDB database (34, 35 ), this is easily done by
consulting the RTprimerDB Web site (http://www.
rtprimerdb.org), which contains all the relevant infor-
mation. For commercial assays, lot information and
the providers’ experimental validation criteria are re-
quired. The reporting of results for nonvalidated com-
mercial assays and assays that have been validated only
in silico are strongly discouraged.
It must be remembered that detection of the pres-
ence of an mRNA provides no information on whether
that mRNA will be translated into a protein or, indeed,
whether a functional protein is translated at all.
Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, or
other protein-quantification methods are not always
able to corroborate quantitative cellular mRNA data.
It is now well established that there is frequently a
lack of concordance between mRNA- and protein-
concentration data (36 ), which is particularly true for
mRNAs that specify proteins that are part of multi-
function protein complexes (37 ). Finally, it has be-
come clear that knowledge of the presence and func-
tion of specific microRNAs is as important to
understanding gene expression as being able to quan-
tify the mRNA species (38 ).
It is also necessary to be aware that most quantita-
tive RNA data are not absolute, but relative. Thus, the
reference genes or materials used for standardization
are critical, and any assessment of the validity of an
RT-qPCR experiment must also consider the appropri-
ateness of the relative-quantification reference. There-
fore, the development of universal reference DNA and
RNA calibration materials, although very helpful
(39, 40 ), will not be a universal panacea (41, 42 ).
Much of the variance in reported expression val-
ues produced in RT-qPCR experiments is not simply
due to variation in experimental protocols but is
caused by corrections applied by various data-
processing algorithms, each of which makes its own
assumptions about the data. Consequently, although
qPCR has frequently been proclaimed a touchstone or
a gold standard, in practice this “standard” is a variable
one, and the reporting of results requires considerable
sophistication of analysis and interpretation (43 ).
3. Research vs Diagnostic Applications
Applications of qPCR technology can be broadly di-
vided into research and diagnostic applications. Re-
search applications usually analyze a wide range of
targets with a fairly low throughput and many dif-
ferent sample types. The main parameters that need
to be addressed relate to assay analytical sensitivity
Reviews
4 Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009)
and specificity, which in this context refer to how
many target copies the assay can detect and whether
the no-template controls (NTCs) are reliably nega-
tive, respectively.
In contrast, diagnostic applications usually ana-
lyze a limited number of targets, but require high-
throughput protocols that are targeted at only a few
sample types. Although all of the considerations that
apply to research applications also apply to diagnostic
assays, clinical-diagnostic assays have a number of ad-
ditional requirements that need to be considered.
These requirements include information on analytical
sensitivity and specificity that in this context refers to
how often the assay returns a positive result when a
target is present and how often it is negative in the
absence of the target. Furthermore, the accuracy and
precision within and between laboratories is often
monitored by external QC programs. Additional clin-
ical laboratory requirements include criteria for gener-
ating reportable results, whether repeated measure-
ments are made on samples, data on the resolution of
false-positive/false-negative data, and the similarity of
results from multiple laboratories that use the same
and different technologies. Thus far, only a couple of
interlaboratory comparisons have been performed,
and both of these studies emphasized the need for stan-
dardization of qPCR diagnostic assays (44, 45 ). An-
other interlaboratory exercise is planned within the Eu-
ropean Framework 7 project: SPIDIA (Standardisation
and Improvement of Generic Pre-analytical Tools and
Procedures for In-Vitro Diagnostics; http://www.
spidia.eu).
4. Sample Acquisition, Handling, and Preparation
Sample acquisition constitutes the first potential
source of experimental variability, especially for exper-
iments targeting RNA, because mRNA profiles are eas-
ily perturbed by sample-collection and -processing
methods. There is some suggestion that fresh tissue can
be stored on ice without major effects on RNA quality
and concentration (46 ), but although this supposition
may be true for some mRNAs and tissues, it may not be
universally applicable. Hence, it is better to be cautious.
Consequently, it is important to report in detail where
the tissue sample was obtained and whether it was pro-
cessed immediately. If the sample was not processed
immediately, it is necessary to report how it was pre-
served and how long and under what conditions it was
stored.
A brief description of the sample is also essential.
For example, microscopical examination of a tumor
biopsy will reveal what percentage of the biopsy is made
up of tumor cells, and this information should be
reported.
Nucleic acid extraction is a second critical step.
Extraction efficiency depends on adequate homogeni-
zation, the type of sample (e.g., in situ tissue vs log-
phase cultured cells), target density, physiological sta-
tus (e.g., healthy, cancerous, or necrotic), genetic
complexity, and the amount of biomass processed.
Therefore, it necessary that details of the nucleic acid–
extraction method be provided and that the methods
used for measuring nucleic acid concentration and as-
sessing its quality be described. Such details are partic-
ularly crucial for RNA extracted from fresh frozen
laser-microdissected biopsy samples, because varia-
tions in tissue-preparation procedures have a substan-
tial effect on both RNA yield and quality (47 ).
5. QC of Nucleic Acids
5.1. RNA SAMPLES
Quantification of RNA in the extracted samples is im-
portant, because it is advisable that approximately the
same amounts of RNA be used when comparing differ-
ent samples. There are several quantification proce-
dures in common use, however, including spectropho-
tometry (NanoDrop; Thermo Scientific), microfluidic
analysis (Agilent Technologies’ Bioanalyzer, Bio-Rad
Laboratories’ Experion), capillary gel electrophoresis
(Qiagen’s QIAxcel), or fluorescent dye detection (Am-
bion/Applied Biosystems’ RiboGreen). The methods
produce different results, making it unwise to try to
compare data obtained with the different methods
(48 ). The preferred method for quantifying RNA uses
fluorescent RNA-binding dyes (e.g., RiboGreen),
which are best for detecting low target concentrations.
In any case, it is advisable to measure all samples with a
single method only and to report this information.
It is also important to test for and report the extent
of genomic-DNA contamination and to record the
threshold cutoff criteria for the amounts of such con-
tamination that are tolerable. It is essential to report
whether the RNA sample has been treated with DNase
(including the type of DNase used and the reaction
conditions) and to report the results from a compari-
son of Cqs obtained with positive and no–reverse tran-
scription controls for each nucleic acid target.
It is also essential to document the quality assess-
ment of RNA templates. The only situation in which
this requirement does not apply is when the quantity of
total RNA extracted is too low to permit quality assess-
ment. This situation arises when RNA is extracted from
single cells, plasma, other cell-free body fluids, some
laser-captured samples, or clarified tissue culture me-
dium. It also applies in cases in which extraction and
RT-qPCR steps are performed as a continuous, single-
tube experiment. Key information to report includes
data on RNA quantity, integrity, and the absence of
MIQE Guidelines for qPCR Reviews
Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009) 5
reverse transcription or PCR inhibitors. It is worth re-
membering that RNA degrades markedly in vivo, ow-
ing to the natural regulation of mRNAs in response to
environmental stimuli (49 ). This source of RNA deg-
radation is beyond the control of the researcher; one of
its manifestations is that even high-quality RNA sam-
ples can show differential degradation of individual
mRNAs.
The A260/A280 ratio must be measured in a buffer
at neutral pH, but such measurement is not sufficient if
the nucleic acid is to be used for quantitative analysis,
especially when the aim is to measure minor differ-
ences (10-fold) in cellular mRNA concentrations.
The absorbance ratio does provide an indication of
RNA purity, because the presence of DNA or residual
phenol alters the ratio. Instead, one should provide gel
electrophoresis evidence at the least or, better yet, re-
sults from a microfluidics-based rRNA analysis (50 ) or
a reference gene/target gene 3:5 integrity assay (51 ).
The advantage of the use of a Bioanalyzer/Experion
system to calculate an RNA integrity number or an
RNA quality indicator number is that these measures
provide quantitative information about the general
state of the RNA sample. It is important to bear in
mind, however, that these numbers relate to rRNA
quality and cannot be expected to be an absolute mea-
sure of quality. Use of a 3:5 assay requires that the
PCR efficiencies of both assays be virtually identical
(51 ) and not be subject to differential inhibition. This
assay also necessitates the establishment of a threshold
criterion that delineates the RNA quality sufficient to
yield reliable results. Ideally, the assay should target a
panel of “integrity reference genes,” probably without
introns, with a 3:5 threshold ratio of approximately
0.2–5. Clearly, further work is required to generate a
universally applicable, cost-effective, and simple pro-
tocol for assessing RNA integrity.
Absence of reverse-transcription activity or PCR
inhibition should be checked by dilution of the sample
(preferably) or use of a universal inhibition assay such
as SPUD (52, 53 ). If the RNA sample is shown to be
partially degraded, it is essential that this information
be reported, because the assay’s sensitivity for detecting
a low-level transcript may be reduced and relative dif-
ferences in the degradation of transcripts may produce
incorrect target ratios.
5.2. DNA SAMPLES
In general, degradation is much less of an issue with
DNA; however, it is important to be able to assess the
extent of DNA degradation for forensic applications,
i.e., in cases in which harsh environmental conditions
at scenes of crimes or mass disasters or at sites involving
missing-person cases may have degraded the chemical
structure of DNA. The small amplicon size of qPCR
assays helps to minimize assay-related problems, but
methods have been developed that provide a quantita-
tive measurement of DNA quality (54 ) and should be
considered for such specialized purposes.
The potential for inhibition is a more generally
applicable variable that must be addressed in a publi-
cation, and it is important to ensure that no inhibitors
copurified with the DNA will distort results, e.g.,
pathogen detection and their quantification (55 ). Al-
though such approaches such as spiking samples with
positive controls (52 ) can be used to detect inhibition,
different PCR reactions may not be equally susceptible
to inhibition by substances copurified in nucleic acid
extracts (56, 57 ). Consequently, it is better to routinely
use dilutions of nucleic acids to demonstrate that ob-
served decreases in Cqs or copy numbers are consistent
with the anticipated result and to report these data.
6. Reverse Transcription
The reverse-transcription step introduces substantial
variation into an RT-qPCR assay (58, 59 ). Hence, it is
essential that a detailed description of the protocol and
reagents used to convert RNA into cDNA be provided.
This documentation must include the amount of RNA
reverse-transcribed, priming strategy, enzyme type,
volume, temperature, and duration of the reverse-
transcription step. It is recommended that the reverse-
transcription step be carried out in duplicate or tripli-
cate and that the total RNA concentration be the same
in every sample (58 ).
7. qPCR
The following information must be provided for
qPCR assays: database accession numbers of each
target and reference gene, the exon locations of each
primer and any probe, the sequences and concentra-
tions of each oligonucleotide, including the identi-
ties, positions, and linkages of any dyes and/or mod-
ified bases. Also required are the concentration and
identity of the polymerase, the amount of template
(DNA or cDNA) in each reaction, the Mg2 concen-
tration, the exact chemical compositions of the
buffer (salts, pH, additives), and the reaction vol-
ume. The investigators must also identify the instru-
ment they used and document all of the PCR cycling
conditions. Because the consumables used affect
thermal cycling, it is necessary to identify the use of
single tubes, strips, or plates, and their manufactur-
ers. The degree of transparency of the plasticware
used, e.g., white or clear, is also important, because
different plastics exhibit substantial differences in
fluorescence reflection and sensitivity (60 ). When
plates are used, the method of sealing (heat bonding
Reviews
6 Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009)
vs adhesives) can affect the evaporation of samples
at the plate perimeter and should therefore be
documented.
Because PCR efficiency is highly dependent on
the primers used, their sequences must be published.
This requirement is perfectly feasible even with com-
mercial primers, because there is a precedent for
companies to make their primer and probe se-
quences available (http://www.primerdesign.co.uk/
research_with_integrity.asp).
In addition, submission to public databases
such as RTprimerDB is strongly encouraged; over
time, these databases could become universal
clearinghouses.
7.1. SECONDARY STRUCTURE
The structure of the nucleic acid target (e.g., stem and
loop secondary RNA structure) has a substantial im-
pact on the efficiency of reverse transcription and the
PCR. Therefore, the positions of primers, probes, and
PCR amplicons must take the folding of RNA tem-
plates into consideration. Sequences should be checked
with nucleic acid–folding software, e.g., mfold for DNA
(http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/dna-form1.cgi) or
RNA (http://frontend.bioinfo.rpi.edu/applications/
mfold/cgi-bin/rna-form1-2.3.cgi). Ideally, the folding
structures should be made available to reviewers.
7.2. SPECIFICITY
In silico tools such as BLAST or equivalent specificity
searches are useful for assay design. Any appreciable
homology to pseudogenes or other unexpected targets
should be documented and provided as aligned se-
quences for review; however, specificity must be vali-
dated empirically with direct experimental evidence
(electrophoresis gel, melting profile, DNA sequencing,
amplicon size, and/or restriction enzyme digestion).
Algorithms for predicting an oligonucleotide’s
melting temperature (Tm) are useful for initial design,
but the practical optimum temperature for annealing
must be determined experimentally. Although primer
optimization has become unfashionable, it is clear that
poor annealing optimization has a large effect on assay
quality (51 ). A marked presence of primer dimers pro-
duces a lower PCR efficiency in probe-based assays and
may generate false positives in assays based on SYBR
Green I. Some evidence for primer optimization
should be provided to reviewers, ideally in the form of
annealing temperature or Mg2 gradients, and be pre-
sented as Cq values, plots of fluorescence vs cycle num-
ber, and/or melting curves (61 ).
7.3. CONTROLS AND QUANTIFICATION CALIBRATORS
In addition to the no–reverse transcription control in
RT-qPCR assays mentioned above, additional controls
and/or quantification calibrators are required for all
qPCR reactions. NTCs detect PCR contamination
when probes are used and can also distinguish unin-
tended amplification products (e.g., primer dimers)
from the intended PCR products in SYBR Green I re-
actions. NTCs should be included on each plate or
batch of samples, and conditions for data rejection be
established. For example, NTCs with Cqs 40 could be
ignored if the Cq for the unknown with the highest
value is 35.
Positive controls in the form of nucleic acids ex-
tracted from experimental samples are useful for mon-
itoring assay variation over time and are essential when
calibration curves are not performed in each run.
Quantification calibrators may be purified target
molecules, such as synthetic RNA or DNA oligonucle-
otides spanning the complete PCR amplicon, plasmid
DNA constructs, cDNA cloned into plasmids, RNA
transcribed in vitro, reference RNA pools, RNA or
DNA from specific biological samples, or internation-
ally recognized biological standards (as they become
available). Dilutions should be carried out into defined
concentrations of carrier tRNA (yeast or Escherichia
coli at 10 –100 ng/L). For detection of human patho-
gens, calibrators can be diluted into negative control
sample RNA or DNA, or they can be diluted into
healthy human plasma, after which lysis may be carried
out in the presence of carrier tRNA. Serial dilutions of a
particular template can be prepared as stock solutions
that resist several freeze–thaw cycles. A fresh batch
should be prepared when a Cq shift of 0.5–1.0 is de-
tected. Alternatively, solutions for calibration curves
can be stored for a week at 4 °C and then discarded.
For diagnostic assays, the qPCR should include an
independently verified calibrator, if available, that lies
within the linear interval of the assay. Positive and neg-
ative extraction controls are also recommended.
7.4. ASSAY PERFORMANCE
The following assay performance characteristics must
be determined: PCR efficiency, linear dynamic range,
LOD, and precision.
7.4.1. PCR efficiency. Robust and precise qPCR assays
are usually correlated with high PCR efficiency. PCR
efficiency is particularly important when reporting
mRNA concentrations for target genes relative to those
of reference genes. The Cq method is one of the
most popular means of determining differences in con-
centrations between samples and is based on normal-
ization with a single reference gene. The difference in
Cq values (Cq) between the target gene and the refer-
ence gene is calculated, and the Cqs of the different
samples are compared directly. The 2 genes must be
amplified with comparable efficiencies for this com-
MIQE Guidelines for qPCR Reviews
Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009) 7
parison to be accurate. The most popular method is not
necessarily the most appropriate, however, and alter-
native, more generalized quantitative models have
been developed to correct for differences in amplifica-
tion efficiency (62 ) and to allow the use of multiple
reference genes (30 ).
PCR amplification efficiency must be established
by means of calibration curves, because such calibra-
tion provides a simple, rapid, and reproducible indica-
tion of the mean PCR efficiency, the analytical sensitiv-
ity, and the robustness of the assay. Amplification
efficiency should be determined from the slope of the
log-linear portion of the calibration curve. Specifically,
PCR efficiency  101/slope  1, when the logarithm of
the initial template concentration (the independent
variable) is plotted on the x axis and Cq (the dependent
variable) is plotted on the y axis. The theoretical max-
imum of 1.00 (or 100%) indicates that the amount of
product doubles with each cycle. Ideally, the CIs or SEs
of the means of estimated PCR efficiencies are reported
from replicated calibration curves.
Calibration curves for each quantified target must
be included with the submitted manuscript so that this
information can be made available to the reviewers;
slopes and y intercepts derived from these calibration
curves must be included with the publication. Differ-
ences in PCR efficiency will produce calibration curves
with different slopes. As a consequence, differences be-
tween the Cq values of the targets and the references
will not remain constant as template amounts are var-
ied, and calculations of relative concentrations will be
inaccurate, yielding misleading results.
Cq values 40 are suspect because of the implied
low efficiency and generally should not be reported;
however, the use of such arbitrary Cq cutoffs is not
ideal, because they may be either too low (eliminating
valid results) or too high (increasing false-positive re-
sults) (26 ).
7.4.2. Linear dynamic range. The dynamic range over
which a reaction is linear (the highest to the lowest
quantifiable copy number established by means of a
calibration curve) must be described. Depending on
the template used for generating calibration curves, the
dynamic range should cover at least 3 orders of magni-
tude and ideally should extend to 5 or 6 log10 concen-
trations. The calibration curve’s linear interval must
include the interval for the target nucleic acids being
quantified. Because lower limits of quantification are
usually poorly defined, the variation at the lowest con-
centration claimed to be within the linear interval
should be determined. Correlation coefficients (r2
values) must be reported, and, ideally, CIs should be
provided through the entire linear dynamic range.
7.4.3. LOD. The LOD is defined as the lowest concen-
tration at which 95% of the positive samples are de-
tected. In other words, within a group of replicates con-
taining the target at concentrations at the LOD, no
more than 5% failed reactions should occur. Low-copy
PCRs are stochastically limited, and LODs of 3 copies
per PCR are not possible. If multiple reactions are per-
formed, however, accurate quantification of lower
concentrations can be obtained via digital PCR
(29, 63, 64 ). Indeed, concentration calibrators can be
checked by limiting dilution to show that the percent-
age of failed and successful reactions follows a Poisson
distribution.
7.4.4. Precision. There are many explanations for vari-
ation in qPCR results, including temperature differ-
ences affecting the completion of annealing and/or de-
naturation, concentration differences introduced by
pipetting errors, and stochastic variation. Precision in
qPCR typically varies with concentration, decreasing
with the copy number. Ideally, intraassay variation (re-
peatability) should be displayed in figures as SD error
bars or as CIs on calibration curves with replicate sam-
ples. CVs should not be used with Cqs (29 ) but can be
used to express the variance in copy numbers or con-
centrations. This technical variation should be distin-
guished from biological variation. Biological replicates
can directly address the statistical significance of differ-
ences in qPCR results between groups or treatments.
For diagnostic assays, it may also be necessary to report
interassay precision (reproducibility) between sites
and different operators.
7.5. MULTIPLEX qPCR
The ability to multiplex greatly expands the power of
qPCR analysis (65, 66 ), particularly when applied to
the simultaneous detection of point mutations or poly-
morphisms (67 ). Multiplexing requires the presenta-
tion of evidence demonstrating that accurate quantifi-
cation of multiple targets in a single tube is not
impaired, i.e., that assay efficiency and the LOD are the
same as when the assays are run in uniplex fashion.
This concern is of particular importance when targets
of appreciably lower abundance are coamplified with
highly abundant targets.
8. Data Analysis
Data analysis includes an examination of the raw data,
an evaluation of their quality and reliability, and the
generation of reportable results. Various data-
collection and -processing strategies have been de-
scribed, and a systematic evaluation has revealed that
qPCR data-analysis methods differ substantially in
their performance (68 ).
Reviews
8 Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009)
Detailed information on the methods of data anal-
ysis and confidence estimation is necessary, together
with specification of the software used. The methods of
identifying outliers and the disposition of such data
must be specified. Documenting assay precision re-
quires identification of the statistical methods used to
evaluate variances (e.g., 95% CIs) and presentation of
the corresponding concentrations or Cq values. Such
information should include both repeatability and re-
producibility data, if available. As discussed above, re-
porting of CVs for Cqs is inappropriate (29 ), because
Cqs will always be lower (and therefore potentially mis-
leading) than CVs calculated for copy numbers. Infor-
mation must be provided on the methods used for as-
sessing accuracy, including the statistical significance
of reported differences between groups.
8.1. NORMALIZATION
Normalization is an essential component of a reliable
qPCR assay because this process controls for variations
in extraction yield, reverse-transcription yield, and ef-
ficiency of amplification, thus enabling comparisons of
mRNA concentrations across different samples. The
use of reference genes as internal controls is the most
common method for normalizing cellular mRNA data;
however, although the use of reference genes is com-
monly accepted as the most appropriate normalization
strategy (69 ), their utility must be experimentally vali-
dated for particular tissues or cell types and specific
experimental designs. Unfortunately, although there is
an increased awareness of the importance of systematic
validation and although the potentially highly mislead-
ing effects of the use of inappropriate reference genes
for normalization are widely known, these consider-
ations also are still widely disregarded (70 ). Conse-
quently, many molecular analyses still contain qPCR
data that are still poorly normalized.
Normalization involves reporting the ratios of the
mRNA concentrations of the genes of interest to those
of the reference genes. Reference gene mRNAs should
be stably expressed, and their abundances should show
strong correlation with the total amounts of mRNA
present in the samples.
Normalization against a single reference gene is
not acceptable unless the investigators present clear ev-
idence for the reviewers that confirms its invariant ex-
pression under the experimental conditions described.
The optimal number and choice of reference genes
must be experimentally determined and the method
reported (71–73 ).
8.2. VARIABILITY
The inherent variability of biological systems may rival
or exceed experimental differences between groups.
This variation is often observed when many biological
replicates are used to increase the statistical significance
of the experiment. Although differences between bio-
logical replicates may be large, sufficient numbers may
allow smaller experimental differences to be discerned.
A recent publication provides a textbook example for
handling such data and how to salvage biologically
meaningful data from assays subject to high biological
variation (74 ). Many factors contribute to experimen-
tal variation and influence the number of biological
replicates necessary to achieve a given statistical power.
Consequently, power analysis is useful for determining
the number of samples necessary for valid conclusions.
8.3. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
The use of the PCR to detect merely the presence of a
nucleic acid template, rather than to quantify it accu-
rately, is referred to as qualitative PCR, which is widely
used in pathogen diagnostics. The problem with qual-
itative/quantitative stratification of PCR methods is
that an accurate yes/no answer requires information
about the low-end sensitivity of the PCR assay. Conse-
quently, even a qualitative assay should provide infor-
mation about the assay’s performance characteristics,
especially with respect to the points discussed in sec-
tions 7.4.2. and 7.4.3.
Conclusions
The necessity for ensuring quality-assurance measures
for qPCR and RT-qPCR assays is well recognized
(25, 44, 75– 86 ). The main difference between qPCR
and conventional (legacy) PCR assays is the expecta-
tion of the former’s potential to quantify target nucleic
acids accurately. This difference must be clearly recog-
nized, and one cannot assume that legacy PCR assays
can translate directly into the qPCR format. Table 1
provides a checklist for authors preparing a report of a
qPCR study. Items deemed essential (E) are required to
allow reviewers to evaluate the work and other investi-
gators to reproduce it. Items considered desirable (D)
are also important and should be included if possible,
but they may not be available in all cases. Certainly, it is
important to apply common sense: Compliance with
all items on the checklist is not necessary for initial
screening of expression signatures targeting hundreds
of targets. Once a more limited set of targets (fewer
than 20) has been identified, however, assay perfor-
mance should be described as detailed by the checklist,
which is hosted on http://www.rdml.org/miqe/.
In summary, the purpose of these guidelines is
3-fold:
1. To enable authors to design and report qPCR exper-
iments that have greater inherent value.
MIQE Guidelines for qPCR Reviews
Clinical Chemistry 55:4 (2009) 9
2. To allow reviewers and editors to measure the tech-
nical quality of submitted manuscripts against an
established yardstick.
3. To facilitate easier replication of experiments de-
scribed in published studies that follow these
guidelines.
As a consequence, investigations that use this widely
applied technology will produce data that are more uni-
form, more comparable, and, ultimately, more reliable.
