Batteries are currently 
being developed to power 
an increasingly diverse 
range of applications, from 
cars to microchips. How 
can scientists achieve the 
performance that each 
application demands? 
How will batteries be able 
to power the many other portable devices that 
will no doubt be developed in the coming 
years? And how can batteries become a sus-
tainable technology for the future?
The technological revolution of the past few 
centuries has been fuelled mainly by varia-
tions of the combustion reaction, the fire that 
marked the dawn of humanity. But this has 
come at a price: the resulting emissions of car-
bon dioxide have driven global climate change. 
For the sake of future generations, we urgently 
need to reconsider how we use energy in every-
thing from barbecues to jet aeroplanes and 
power stations. 
If a new energy economy is to emerge, it 
must be based on a cheap and sustainable 
energy supply. One of the most flagrantly 
wasteful activities is travel, and here battery 
devices can potentially provide a solution, 
especially as they can be used to store energy 
from sustainable sources such as the wind and 
solar power. 
Because batteries are inherently simple in 
concept, it is surprising that their development 
has progressed much more slowly than other 
areas of electronics. As a result, they are often 
seen as being the heaviest, costliest and least-
green components of any electronic device. It 
was the lack of good batteries that slowed down 
the deployment of electric cars and wireless 
communication, which date from at least 1899 
and 1920, respectively (Fig. 1). The slow prog-
ress is due to the lack of suitable electrode mat-
erials and electrolytes, together with difficulties 
in mastering the interfaces between them. 
All batteries are composed of two electrodes 
connected by an ionically conductive material 
called an electrolyte. The two electrodes have 
different chemical potentials, dictated by the 
chemistry that occurs at each. When these elec-
trodes are connected by means of an external 
device, electrons spontaneously flow from the 
more negative to the more positive potential. 
Ions are transported through the electrolyte, 
maintaining the charge balance, and electrical 
energy can be tapped by the external circuit. In 
secondary, or rechargeable, batteries, a larger 
voltage applied in the opposite direction can 
cause the battery to recharge. 
The amount of electrical energy per mass 
or volume that a battery can deliver is a func-
tion of the cell’s voltage and capacity, which 
are dependent on the chemistry of the sys-
tem. Another important parameter is power, 
which depends partly on the battery’s engi-
neering but crucially on the chemicals the bat-
tery contains. Hundreds of electrochemical 
couples were proposed during the nineteenth 
and early twentieth centuries, the most nota-
ble primary battery being Zn–MnO2, with 
lead–acid and Ni–Cd being the most common 
secondaries1.
The stored energy content of a battery can 
be maximized in three ways: (1) by having 
a large chemical potential difference between 
the two electrodes; (2) by making the mass (or

Figure 1 | Revisiting the past. In 1899 a Belgian car, La jamais contente (top left), equipped with lead–
acid batteries, reached a speed of 30 metres per second (ref. 26). In the same year, at a car competition 
in Paris, the only petrol-driven car was disqualified for having unpractically high consumption. Inside 
the United States, between 1900 and 1920, the proportion of electrical cars produced fell from 60% 
to 4% of the total. One century later, fully electrical cars, such as the Tesla roadster (bottom left), are 
coming back into the picture. Meanwhile, the first wireless communication took place in Pennsylvania 
in 1920 (top right, after ref. 27). Nearly 100 years later, the latest mobile phones (bottom right) can 
perform a wide range of functions.

volume) of the reactants per exchanged electron as 
small as possible; and (3) by ensuring that the 
electrolyte is not consumed in the chemistry of 
the battery. This final condition was not true of 
the three principal battery technologies devel-
oped in the twentieth century, but holds for the 
more recent Ni–MH and lithium-ion batteries. 
One of the key elements of these two batteries 
is that the same ion (H+ for Ni–MH and Li+ for 
lithium-ion batteries) participates at both elec-
trodes, being reversibly inserted and extracted 
from the electrode material, with the concomi-
tant addition or removal of electrons. Ni–MH 
batteries are used to power hybrid vehicles 
and cheaper electronics, whereas lithium-ion 
batteries have conquered high-end electronics 
and are now being used in power tools. Lith-
ium-ion batteries are also entering the hybrid 
electric-vehicle market and are a serious con-
tender to power the electric cars of the future. 
 The lithium-ion battery, first commercial-
ized by Sony in 1991, owes its name to the 
exchange of the Li+ ion between the graphite 
(LixC6) anode and a layered-oxide (Li1−xTMO2) 
cathode2, with TM being a transition metal 
(usually cobalt but sometimes nickel or man-
ganese). The energy it stores (≈180 Wh kg−1) 
at an average voltage of 3.8 V is only a factor 
of 5 higher than that stored by the much older 
lead–acid batteries. This may seem poor in the 
light of Moore’s law in electronics (according 
to which memory capacity doubles every 18 
months), but it still took a revolution in materi-
als science to achieve it. 
Billions of lithium-ion cells are produced 
for portable electronics, but this is not sustain-
able as cobalt must be obtained from natural 
resources (it makes up 20 parts per million of 
Earth’s crust3,4). In addition, there are safety 
concerns, as the presence of both combus-
tible material and an oxidizing agent carries 
a risk of run away reactions resulting in fires 
or explosions. Improvements in the electro-
lyte composition could make the chemistry 
safer, but accidents are mainly a result of fierce 
cost-cutting and attempts to cram more active 
material in the same volume, causing internal 
short-circuits. As a result, improvements in 
monitoring and management are essential if 
lithium-ion batteries are to fulfil their potential 
in the automotive market. 
Lithium-ion batteries would also need to 
reduce their carbon footprint, which is cur-
rently about 70 kg CO2 per kWh (ref. 5). The 
carbon-related benefits of electric vehicles or 
‘plug-in hybrids’ become apparent only after 
around 120 recharges with respect to electric-
ity from coal, assuming a power-plant effi-
ciency of 35% and that the batteries replace a 
petrol engine in which 20% of the heat from 
combustion is converted into useable energy. 
However, these break-even numbers need to 
be reduced. 
Replacing each of the world’s 800 million 
cars and lorries with electric vehicles or plug-
in hybrids powered by 15-kWh lithium-ion 
batteries would use up to 30% of the world’s 
known reserves of lithium. But lithium is also 
found in unlimited quantities in sea water3,4, 
and concentrating it from brines is much 
greener (requiring just solar energy) than 
conventional mining. The demand for lith-
ium could also be eased by recycling, which 
has already proved its value with lead–acid 
batteries. All these problems must be overcome 
if lithium batteries are to take their place as the 
batteries of the future (Fig. 2). 
The nanotechnology revolution
Most attempts to improve the design of lithium-
ion batteries have tackled the problem at the 
macroscopic scale, but work is now focusing 
on the nanoscale. Nanomaterials were slow to 
enter the field of energy storage because the 
effective increase in the electrodes’ surface area 
raised the risk of secondary reactions involving 
electrolyte decomposition. Only as recently as 
2000 was it realized that such reactions could 
be controlled by coating the electrodes to pro-
tect the electrolyte from unwanted oxidation 
or reduction by the electrode materials. The 
arrival of nanomaterials gave lithium-ion bat-
teries a new lease of life6 and provided benefits 
in terms of capacity, power, cost and materials 
sustainability that are still far from being fully 
exploited. 
Electrode kinetic issues can be circumvented 
by switching to nanomaterials combined with 
carbon ‘nano-painting’7, in which the grains 
are coated with a thin layer of carbon to bring 
the required conductivity to individual grains, 
whose small size shortens the diffusion path 
for ions and electrons. Moreover, by accom-
modating the strains associated with lithium 
insertion/removal reactions, as the volume 
can expand or contract several-fold, this has 
also made it possible to use materials with large 
volume changes on reaction with lithium, such 
as alloys. But there are pitfalls, the most impor-
tant being the poor packing density of elec-
trodes based on nanomaterials, which limits 
Figure 2 | Battery 
chemistry over the 
years. Present-day 
battery technologies 
are being outpaced 
by the ever-
increasing power 
demands from new 
applications. As well 
as being inherently 
safe, batteries of the 
future will have to 
integrate the concept 
of environmental 
sustainability.

the energy that can be stored per unit volume 
or mass because there is a larger proportion of 
‘inert’ components such as current collectors 
or electrolyte.
Another advantage of nanomaterials is that 
they can change the reaction pathway, afford-
ing high capacities, rechargeability and gener-
ality to a range of battery systems8. One such 
reaction pathway is referred to as a ‘conversion’ 
from transition-metal oxides:
TMxOy + 2ye− + 2yLi+ →← x[T
M]0 + yLi2O;
the final product consists of a homogeneous 
distribution of metal nanoparticles ([TM]0, 
where the superscript 0 indicates the metal-
lic form) embedded in a Li2O matrix (Fig. 3). 
The drawback with this mechanism, however, 
is that the large voltage difference between 
charge and discharge results in poor energy 
efficiency. This problem is being addressed 
by studies of both the material chemistry and 
morphology and the electrode configuration. 
The hunt is also under way for materials that 
can undergo conversion reactions involving 
multiple electrons at high potential, for use as 
cathode materials. However, the full impact 
of nanomaterials on living cells has yet to be 
appraised, although the risk is minimal when 
they are produced in situ, as they are for the 
conversion reaction.
Solid electrolytes were quicker to benefit 
from the use of nanomaterials9. The addition 
of ‘nano-fillers’ (nano-grains dispersed in 
a polymer, such as Al2O3 or TiO2) to simple
polyether-based electrolytes increases the con-
ductivity several-fold at 60–80 °C, but there is 
no advantage at room temperature. Organ-
izing the polymer strands in such a way as to 
increase the order locally (using crystalline 
whorls, stretching or even chirality) can also 
provide benefits, by increasing conductivity at 
low temperatures, and further work is needed 
to assess the merits of using block co-polymers 
(AB or ABA)10. The phase separation inherent 
to these systems results in good mechanical 
properties, but also offers a way of increasing 
dissociation by partitioning anions and cations 
in the two sub-phases. Giving the two phases 
different wetting or adhesion properties can 
help by avoiding grain growth as the polymer’s 
nano-domains will determine the partitioning 
of space. 
True polymer batteries may still be some 
way off, but in the meantime we will see more 
attempts to use ionic liquids as either solvents 
for lithium salts or plasticizers for polyether-
based electrolytes. Ionic liquids have exceed-
ingly low vapour pressures, are non-flammable 
and have high conductivities, making them 
serious contenders for safer batteries. But it 
remains to be seen whether they can be pro-
duced cheaply enough, at the desired purity, with 
sufficient conductivity at low temperature. 
Beyond nanomaterials
The components of today’s lithium-ion 
batteries, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, are not 
produced from renewable energy resources 
but from ores, and extracting the raw materials
and manufacturing the electrodes will require 
increasing amounts of energy as they become 
scarcer. Will the lithium-ion battery, which is 
so energetically expensive to fabricate, remain 
attractive and viable in the long term? In 50 
years, if all cars become electric and rely on 
these scarce materials, might we face stag-
gering price increases like those recently 
seen with fossil fuels? Not if we find a way 
of making lithium-ion batteries sustainable 
while maintaining or exceeding the perform-
ance of today’s batteries. One option is to 
use renewable electrodes made from natural 
resources, just as fuel cells can use hydrogen 
or (m)ethanol made from biomass. But what 
would these electrodes be like? 
Inspired by nature
When scientists need new approaches, they 
often turn to the chemistry of life, with its 
virtually unlimited and incredible reaction 
mechanisms. The battery’s insertion reac-
tion may have no real equivalent in the living 
world, but the materials themselves could be 
fabricated in living cells. Phosphate species are 
manipulated to make DNA and ATP, so it is 
not so hard to envisage an enzyme-mediated 
synthesis of LiFePO4, especially as the pH for 
the precipitation is close to the physiological 
value of 7. The same outlook applies to con-
version reactions, as preliminary work11 has 
demonstrated the synthesis of hydrated Co3O4 
and MnO2 with the help of a virus and a bac-
terium, respectively. 
Perhaps the ultimate in conversion reactions 
also comes from living systems. The protein 
apoferritin, which encloses a small crystal of 
iron oxide (Fe2O3.nH2O), can either grow or 
dissolve the particle according to the organism’s 
current need for iron12. So could polymers with 
properties rather similar to proteins, adsorbed 
on the surface of a conversion electrode, con-
trol the growth or dissolution of the TMxOy and 
Li2O crystals, the reversible formation of which 
is key to increasing the energy efficiency?
Regarding the feasibility of using electro-
chemically active organic molecules as cathode 
materials, the use of polyaniline13 and other 
redox polymers14 has been much hyped over 
the years, but development has been disap-
pointing. However, because lithium-exchang-
ing materials do not involve the electrolyte in 
their redox processes, substituting the cath-
ode for an organic material might boost the 
capacity. The feasibility of using active LixC6O6 
organic molecules that can be prepared from 
natural sugars common in living systems 
(Fig. 4) is currently under investigation15. In 
the light of such findings, we can speculate on 
the use of hypericine (a polyquinone-based 
active ingredient of St John’s wort) or the con-
densation polymers of malic acid as potential 
high-capacity cathode materials.
The close relationship between carbo-
hydrates and their oxidized polyketone forms 
makes the former the logical starting point 
for the design of new electrode materials.

Poly ketones can be obtained from natural 
sources and are unlimited because sugars can 
be made by living species or artificially in green 
chemistry16. Nor have sugars been overlooked 
for use in bio fuel-cells, a much improved ver-
sion of which has recently been unveiled17. 
Although complex and unlikely to yield 
instant results, the search for electroactive 
organic molecules synthesized from biomass 
could pave the way for the next generation 
of lithium-based batteries. Organic materials 
have already made considerable inroads into 
the semiconducting industry, in light-emitting 
diodes, solar cells and transistors, and they are 
expected to penetrate the energy field in the 
coming decades. However, it would be foolish 
to ignore the fact that organic materials have 
several disadvantages in terms of their lim-
ited thermal stability, low specific gravity and 
appreciable solubility in electrolytes. 
Lithium–oxygen batteries
Air electrodes and metal–air battery tech-
nologies have already been used in primary 
systems such as fuel cells, but the use of lithium 
instead of zinc as the metal will increase the 
energy output eightfold. An oxygen electrode 
proceeding in tandem with lithium according 
to the reaction 2Li + O2 → Li2O2 can deliver a 
capacity of 1,200 mAh g−1. The first lithium–air 
cell was successfully assembled and discharged 
in 1996 (ref. 18), but attractive rechargeability 
was demonstrated only recently19. 
It could be argued that such a system unites 
within the same device the two most promi-
nent failures of battery and fuel-cell technolo-
gies, namely the inability to master lithium 
and oxygen electrodes. These perceived issues 
have prevented the practical use of lithium–air 
batteries. However, one advantage of such a sys-
tem is the formation of Li2O2 without cleaving 
the O–O bond, which has limited both kinetics 
and rechargeability in aqueous systems because 
there is a large activation energy and platinum 
catalysts are often required.
Improving energy storage and preventing 
Li2O2 from clogging the electrode require a 
better understanding of the reaction mecha-
nism of the oxygen electrode. Engineering and 
chemical advances are also required to pre-
vent the ingress of either CO2 or H2O, which 
could react with either Li2O2 or lithium metal. 
But there are reasons for optimism. The use 
of nanomaterials makes it possible to design 
porous, catalysed, three-dimensional elec-
trodes20 (Fig. 5) with improved kinetics and 
energy efficiency. The use of ionic liquids, 
which can be made hydrophobic, will put an 
end to problems caused by the entry of water. 
However, if ionic liquids are to be used as elec-
trolytes, they must be combined with a highly 
hygroscopic Li salt, so preparing them remains 
a serious challenge. 
Lithium has been the anode of choice for 
years, but much more work is still needed. 
When used with liquid electrolytes and gels, 
the metal is redeposited unevenly in the form 
of dendrites, leading to inherently unsafe cells 
with a short lifetime. It has been suggested 
that the cause lies in current inhomogenei-
ties induced by the passivation layer present 
on the surface of lithium metal21. Using dry 
polymer electrolytes instead keeps the prob-
lem at bay for the first 600 cycles, but does 
not solve it. The classic strategy22 to get uni-
form microcrystalline metal deposition in 
an aqueous solution from anionic complexes 
(for example, silver metal from Ag(CN)2−) 
has not been applied to the lithium elec-
trode. In this strategy, the surges in local 
current result in a drift of the negative ions 
from the interface, leading to a depletion of 
the plating species and hindering the forma-
tion of metal dendrites. The same principle 
could be applied to lithium systems by using 
charged chelating complexes of the LiX2− type, 
formed, for instance, using bidentate ligands 
of the 1,3-dione family (acetyl acetone) and 
having K+ as a counter-cation (see Fig. 6). 
Another approach would be to use unipolar
electrolytes, in which only the cations carry 
charge, but these have never been seriously 
studied in the context of plating lithium metal. 
This is surprising because polyelectrolytes with 
fixed negative charges attached to a macromole-
cule are the only way to avoid the depletion or 
over-concentration of salt arising from the

mobility of the anions. These two strategies 
(anionic lithium salts and unipolar conductivity) 
should be further explored to ensure that all 
avenues towards making the lithium-metal 
electrode viable have been exhausted. 
Alternatives to lithium 
Although we have focused on lithium, there 
are several alternatives for use as electrodes 
(Table 1). The metals worth considering are 
magnesium (ref. 23) and aluminium (ref. 24) 
because of their light weight, but they deliver 
less voltage, undermining their use as anodes, 
and repetitive plating of these metals is dif-
ficult using most electrolytes. Similarly, only 
high-capacity cathode materials can be consid-
ered, which narrows it down to oxygen or sul-
phur for magnesium, or graphite fluoride for 
aluminium, to harness the metal’s high affinity 
for fluorine. However, little is known about the 
kinetics of electrode reactions involving the 
motion of multivalent species, and addressing 
these challenges would need extensive collabo-
ration between organometal researchers and 
electrochemists.
Proton-based battery technologies have 
been well studied, but do they still have any-
thing to offer? Even with the best air electrode, 
to be competitive with lithium-ion batteries, a 
hydrogen system, with a voltage of 1.0–1.5 V, 
requires the anode to have an extremely low 
equivalent mass, far below that of conventional 
hydrogen-storing alloys. The only candidates 
are light elements, given that C–H bonds are 
too covalent and cannot (yet) be activated for 
reversible room-temperature systems. Another 
alternative for the negative electrode would be 
to exploit the reversibility of the N–H bond in 
semiconjugated polymers (see Fig. 6). These 
low-potential (V versus H2/H+) materials could 
be used as high-capacity electrodes, although 
their low electronic conductivity could prove 
problematic. 
Miniature powerhouses
As well as large-scale applications, such as elec-
tric vehicles, batteries must also be developed 
to satisfy recent advances in microelectronics. 
These require miniature power sources, such 
as solid-state, lithium-based, thin-film bat-
teries. Much of the work has focused on flat, 
two-dimensional configurations, but these 
are limited in terms of energy output, and the 
need for greater performance has recently led 
microbattery researchers to explore the third 
dimension25. This might seem relatively easy, 
given the spectacular three-dimensional cir-
cuitry that the silicon microelectronic industry 
now has to offer. However, microlithography 
processes have proved both awkward and 
costly to transfer to batteries. 
A combined chemical–electrochemical 
approach has much to offer as a way of man-
ipulating materials at the atomic scale, and 
could be used to develop ‘skyscraper’ batteries 
(Fig. 7). Similarly, adding a third dimension 
opens the way to a larger variety of configura-
tions (such as the assembly of positive–negative 
electrodes and electrolyte) while maintaining 
a short diffusion length for electrodes and 
ions, which is essential if a battery is to have 
the required power. 
Conclusions
It is not yet clear whether the next generation 
of batteries could be successfully integrated 
into an energy market that is currently linked 
to global warming. Fame and fortune certainly 
await anyone who can come up with a viable 
alternative to fossil fuels. Furthermore, it is dif-
ficult to see how the performance gap between 
the internal-combustion engine and lithium-
ion batteries will be filled using only new bat-
tery technology; other approaches, such as 
fuel cells, will be needed, but here a complete 
overhaul of present systems will probably be 
required. 
In our journey into the future we have 
re investigated existing systems and suggested 
new trends and ideas that require much work 
to become a reality. Designing green and sus-
tainable battery systems is essential, so criteria 
such as life cycle, abundance of raw materials 
and electrode recycling are becoming cru-
cial. For these reasons, much is expected of 
the lithium–air system, which offers a great 
improvement in energy density, and lithium-

based systems that use electroactive organic 
molecules, which could be obtained from 
biomass using green chemistry. Yet it seems 
incon gruous to insist that batteries are sus-
tainable while the car or appliance they drive 
is not.
The next generation of lithium-ion batter-
ies fully based on nanomaterials will soon be 
here, followed by lithium–air batteries and 
others using organic materials. And there is 
plenty to inspire us in the living world, as long 
as we can capture the function of each molecule 
in a cumulative sequential process, which is not 
an easy task. Both biofuel cells and high-volt-
age liquid-electrolyte microbatteries inspired 
by electric eels have already been demon-
strated. We all live on organic-based energy, 
so why shouldn’t our appliances and vehicles 
use it too? 
One thing is clear, however. Solving the 
remaining challenges will require researchers 
from a range of disciplines, and their success 
will depend on the efficiency of their cross-
fertilization. ■

Figure 7 | Entering the third dimension. Schematic representation of a 
three-dimensional, integrated, solid-state lithium-ion battery. The surface 
area of the battery has increased 25-fold compared with a two-dimensional 
thin-film battery with the same footprint surface area, and will therefore be 
able to provide enough energy to power smart autonomous network devices 
related to sensing applications. (Courtesy of P. H. L. Notten, R. A. H. Niessen
