Unmet Needs for Analyzing Biological Big Data: 
A Survey of 704 NSF Principal Investigators 
 
Lindsay Barone,∗ Jason Williams,* and David Micklos* 
 
Abstract 
In a 2016 survey of 704 National Science Foundation (NSF) Biological Sciences Directorate 
principle investigators (BIO PIs), nearly 90% indicated they are currently or will soon be 
analyzing large data sets. BIO PIs considered a range of computational needs important to their 
work—including high performance computing (HPC), bioinformatics support, multi-step 
workflows, updated analysis software, and the ability to store, share, and publish data. Previous 
studies in the United States and Canada emphasized infrastructure needs. However, BIO PIs said 
the most pressing unmet needs are training in data integration, data management, and scaling 
analyses for HPC—acknowledging that data science skills will be required to build a deeper 
understanding of life. This portends a growing data knowledge gap in biology and challenges 
institutions and funding agencies to redouble their support for computational training in biology.  
 
Background 
Genotypic data based on DNA and RNA sequence have been the major driver of biology’s 
evolution into a data science. The current Illumina HiSeq X sequencing platform can generate 
900 billion nucleotides of raw DNA sequence in under three days—four times the number of 
annotated nucleotides currently stored in GenBank, the U.S. “reference library” of DNA 
sequences (1, 2). In the last decade, a 50,000-fold reduction in the cost of DNA sequencing (3) 
has led to an accumulation of 9.3 quadrillion (million billion) nucleotides of raw sequence data 
in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). 
The amount of sequence in the SRA doubled on average every 6–8 months from 2007–16 (4). It 
is estimated that by 2025, the storage of human genomes alone will require 2–40 exabytes (5), 
where an exabyte of storage would hold 100,000 times the printed materials of the U.S. Library 
of Congress (6). Beyond genotypic data, Big Data are flooding biology from all quarters—
phenotypic data from agricultural field trials, patient medical records, and clinical trials; image 
data from microscopy, medical scanning, and museum specimens; interaction data from 
biochemical, cellular, physiological, and ecological systems—as well as an influx of data from 
translational fields such as bioengineering, materials science, and biogeography. 
 
A 2003 report of an NSF blue-ribbon panel, headed by Charles Atkins, popularized the term 
cyberinfrastructure to describe systems of data storage, software, HPC, and people that can solve 
scientific problems of the size and scope presented by big data (7). The Atkins Report was the 
impetus for several cyberinfrastructure projects in the biological sciences—including the NSF’s 
CyVerse, the Department of Energy’s KBase, and the European Union’s ELIXIR. The report 
described cyberinfrastructure as the means to harness the data revolution and to develop a 
“knowledge economy.” Although people were acknowledged as active elements of 
cyberinfrastructure, few published studies have assessed how well their computational and 
cyberinfrastructure needs are being met.

In 2006, EDUCAUSE surveyed 328 information technology (IT) professionals, primarily chief 
information officers, at institutions in the U.S. and Canada (8). When asked about preferences for 
funding allocation, respondents rated training and consulting (20%) a distant second to 
infrastructure and storage (46%). This suggested that “training and consulting get short shrift 
when bumped against the realities of running an IT operation.” Infrastructure and training 
emerged as similarly important in a study done as part of the 2015 University of Illinois’ “Year 
of Cyberinfrastructure” (9).  Faculty and graduate students responding to a survey (n = 327) said 
they needed better access to data storage (36%), data visualization (29%), and HPC (19%). 
Although it was not directly addressed in the survey, training—on a range of technologies and 
across skills levels—emerged as a major need in focus groups (n = 200).  
 
Over the last four years, CyVerse has taken the computational pulse of the biological sciences by 
surveying attendees at major professional meetings. Consistently, and across different conference 
audiences, 94% of students, faculty, and researchers said that they currently use large data sets in 
their research or think they will in the near future (n = 1,097). Even so, 47% rated their 
bioinformatics skill level as “beginner,” 35% rated themselves “intermediate,” and 6% said they 
have never used bioinformatics tools; only 12% rate themselves “advanced” (n = 608). Fifty-
eight percent felt their institutions do not provide all the computational resources needed for their 
research (n = 1,024). These studies suggest a scenario of big data inundating unprepared 
biologists.  
 
Methods 
In summer 2016 we expanded upon our previous studies with a purposive needs assessment of 
principal investigators (PIs) with grants from the National Science Foundation Directorate of 
Biological Sciences (BIO). Working from a list of 5,197 active grant awards, we removed 
duplicate PIs and those without email addresses to produce a final list of 3,987 subjects. The 
survey was administered in Survey Monkey using established methods (10). An initial email 
invitation with a link to the survey was sent to each subject in June 2016, with three follow-up 
emails sent at two-week intervals. Surveys were completed by 704 PIs, a response rate of 17.7% 
that provided a +/-3.35% margin of error at the 95% confidence level. 
  
The respondents were asked to consider 13 computational elements of research—including data 
storage, discovery, analysis, and sharing. For each need, PIs were asked to reflect on their current 
use, their anticipated future requirements, and the institutional resources available to meet the 
need. Data were analyzed in IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. “I don’t know” responses were 
eliminated from the analysis of computational needs questions. Frequencies were calculated for 
each of the affirmative and negative responses in the computational needs matrix. Chi-square 
tests for independence were used to determine if there were significant differences in 
computational needs across three dimensions: 1) NSF BIO division, 2) research area 
(bioinformatics/computational biology versus all others), and 3) research group size (groups of 
less than five versus groups with more than five).

Results 
The respondents were relatively 
evenly dispersed among four 
major BIO divisions: Division 
of Biological Infrastructure 
(DBI), Division of 
Environmental Biology (DEB), 
Division of Integrative 
Organismal Systems (IOS), and 
Division of Molecular and 
Cellular Biosciences (MCB). 
These BIO PIs worked with a 
variety of data—with sequence, 
image, phenotype, and 
ecological data predominating 
(Figure 1). The vast majority 
(87%) said they are currently 
using big datasets in their research or will within the next three years. This is slightly lower than 
in our previous studies of meeting attendees, a large proportion of whom had a genomics focus 
or were students or early career researchers.

statistically significant chi square result between groups (bioinformaticians versus others; large research groups versus small). 
More than half of the PIs said that 11 of the 13 computational needs are currently important to 
their research. The proportions increased across all needs—to 82–97%—when PIs considered 
what would be important three years in the future (Figure 2). Significantly more PIs who 
identified themselves as bioinformaticians said nine of the current needs are important compared 
to PIs from all other disciplines. Significantly more PIs from larger research groups (> five 
people) said seven of the current needs are important compared to those from smaller groups. 
Most of the differences between bioinformaticians and larger research groups persisted in their 
predictions of future needs (Table 1). 
 
Significantly more PIs funded by DEB said five of the current needs are important compared to 
PIs funded through the other three NSF research divisions. However, differences between the 
four NSF divisions disappeared for predictions of future need—suggesting that computational 
needs will converge across all fields of biology in the future (Table 2).

A majority of PIs—across bioinformatics/other disciplines, larger/smaller groups, and the four 
NSF programs—said their institutions are not meeting nine of 13 needs (Figure 3). Training on 
integration of multiple data types (89%), on data management and metadata (78%), and on 
scaling analysis to cloud/HP computing (71%) were the three greatest unmet needs. High 
performance computing was an unmet need for only 27% of PIs—with similar percentages 
across disciplines, different sized groups, and NSF programs.

Discussion 
This study fills a gap in the published literature on the computational needs of biological science 
researchers. Respondents had all been awarded at least one peer-reviewed grant from the BIO 
Directorate of NSF and thus represent competitive researchers across a range of biological 
disciplines. Even so, a majority of this diverse group of successful biologists did not feel that 
their institutions are meeting their needs for tackling large data sets. 
 
This study stands in stark contrast to previous work, including one with a very different 
audience, which identified infrastructure and data storage as the most pressing computational 
needs. BIO PIs ranked availability of data storage and HPC lowest on their list of unmet needs.   
This provides strong evidence that the NSF and individual universities have succeeded in 
developing a broadly available infrastructure to support data-driven biology. Hardware is not the 
issue. The problem is the growing gap between the accumulation of many kinds of data—and 
researchers’ knowledge about how to use it effectively. The biologists in this study see training 
as the most important factor limiting their ability to best use the big data generated by their 
research.  
 
Closing this growing data knowledge gap in biology demands a concerted effort by individual 
biologists, by institutions, and by funding agencies. We need to be creative in scaling up 
computational training to reach large numbers of biologists and in measuring the impact of our 
educational investments. Metrics for a super computer are readily described in terms of petaflops 
and CPUs, and we can facilely measure training attendance and “satisfaction.” However, 
answering unmet training needs will require a better understanding of how faculty are attempting 
to meet these needs—and how we can best assess their outcomes (11). For example, datasets 
available at the SRA provide almost unlimited entry points for course-based undergraduate 
research experiences (CUREs), which scale up discovery research in the context of for-credit 
courses. Participation in CUREs significantly improves student graduation rates and retention in 
science–effects that persist across racial and socioeconomic status (12, 13). However, many 
biologists acquire skills for big data analysis on their own. Software Carpentry and Data 
Carpentry (14) are volunteer-driven organizations that provide a cost-effective, disseminated 
model for reaching biologists outside of an academic classroom. 
 
Reflected in the top two unmet needs of BIO PIs is the looming problem of integrating data from 
different kinds of experiments and computational platforms. This will be required for a deeper 
understanding of “the rules of life” (15, 16)—notably the genotype-environment-phenotype 
interactions that are essential to predicting how agricultural plants and animals can adapt to 
changing climates. Such integration demands new standards of data management and attention to 
metadata about how these data are collected. The BIO PIs in this study are anticipating a new 
world of pervasive data in which they will need to become data scientists.
