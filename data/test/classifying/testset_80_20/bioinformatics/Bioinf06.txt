ABSTRACT
Summary: RAxML-VI-HPC (randomized axelerated maximum likeli-
hood for high performance computing) is a sequential and parallel pro-
gram for inference of large phylogenies with maximum likelihood (ML).
Low-level technical optimizations, a modification of the search
algorithm, and the use of the GTR+CATapproximation as replacement
for GTR+G yield a program that is between 2.7 and 52 times faster than
the previous version of RAxML. A large-scale performance comparison
with GARLI, PHYML, IQPNNI and MrBayes on real data containing
1000 up to 6722 taxa shows that RAxML requires at least 5.6 times
less main memory and yields better trees in similar times than the best
competing program (GARLI) on datasets up to 2500 taxa. On datasets
4000 taxa it also runs 2–3 times faster than GARLI. RAxML has been
parallelized with MPI to conduct parallel multiple bootstraps and infer-
encesondistinct starting trees. Theprogramhasbeenused to compute
ML trees on two of the largest alignments to date containing 25057
(1463 bp) and 2182 (51 089 bp) taxa, respectively.

1 INTRODUCTION
Phylogenetic inference with the maximum likelihood (ML) method
is NP-hard (Chor and Tuller, 2005). Despite the algorithmic com-
plexity and the high-computational cost of ML, significant progress
has been achieved with the release of fast and accurate programs
such as PHYML (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003), IQPNNI (Minh
et al., 2005), MrBayes (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003),
GARLI (Zwickl, 2006) and RAxML (Stamatakis et al., 2005).
Most of these programs allow for inference of 1000 taxon trees
on a single CPU in <24 h.
This paper describes the new version of RAxML [Randomized
axelerated maximum likelihood for high performance computing
(RAxML-VI-HPC, v2.0.1)], which is significantly faster than the
previous versions of RAxML due to simple, yet very efficient tech-
nical optimizations and a slight alteration of the search algorithm. In
addition, RAxML has been parallelized with MPI to enable parallel
bootstrapping and multiple inferences on distinct starting trees on
PC clusters. Moreover, it implements bifurcating and multifurcating
constraint trees and the capability to assign and estimate separate
model parameters1 for individual genes of multi-gene alignments
(mixed/partitioned models).
The main focus is on the computation of huge trees (1000 taxa)
for real-world data and the comparative performance study with
GARLI, IQPNNI, MrBayes and PHYML. Since the efficiency of the
novel optimizations in RAxML-VI-HPC increases with the number
of taxa, less significant performance improvements will be observed
on smaller datasets. Performance comparisons of RAxML with
other popular ML programs on smaller datasets, including simu-
lated alignments, can be found in Hordijk and Gascuel (2005),
Stamatakis et al. (2005) and Zwickl (2006). Finally, the experi-
mental study also shows that the GTR+CAT approximation [see
Stamatakis (2006) for a detailed description] can be efficiently
deployed as a replacement for the significantly more compute-
and memory intensive GTR+G model.
Some of the largest published ML-based analyses to date have
been conducted using RAxML (Robertson et al., 2005; Ley et al.,
2005, 2006). On-going work includes the computation of a back-
bone tree for Bacteria with 9000 taxa, a phylogeny for Acer with
582 taxa, and the analysis of a mammalian multi-gene alignment
comprising 2182 sequences.
2 OPTIMIZATIONS OF RAxML
A detailed description of the optimizations listed below is provided
in the on-line supplement. The main improvements cover:
 An efficient mechanism to store and re-store topologies and
branch lengths via rearrangement descriptors.
 A consequent re-use of partial likelihood vectors.
 A dynamic adaptation of the rearrangement distance.
 Low-level optimization of the GTR+CAT and GTR+G likeli-
hood functions.
 An efficient re-implementation of Maximum Parsimony
starting tree computations.
An important and generally applicable insight from those optim-
izations is that storing and re-storing an unrooted tree topology
with 2n3 branch lengths and 2n2 nodes can become a major
1CAT and G cannot be used simultaneously in the same analysis.

performance bottleneck for trees with >1000 taxa. It is thus import-
ant to store alternative topologies as a sequence of topological
changes applied to the current topology rather than as complete
data object. Only the consequent avoidance of storage operations
reveals the actual power of the Lazy Subtree Rearrangement (LSR)
mechanism introduced in Stamatakis et al. (2005).
Another issue which becomes important for huge trees is to
determine a ‘good’ rearrangement distance, i.e. re-insertion radius
for the LSR moves. In RAxML-VI the algorithm initially determ-
ines the best rearrangement distance by applying distances of 5,
10, . . . , 25 for one iteration of LSRs, to the starting tree. The min-
imum rearrangement distance which yields the best likelihood
improvement on the starting tree is then selected for the inference.
Despite the extra computations which are performed, a ‘good’
rearrangement distance pays off in terms of likelihood units for
huge alignments with large evolutionary diameters (e.g. the 6722
and 7769 taxa alignments, see Supplementary Table 2).
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The exact experimental set-up as well as the results are described in
detail in the on-line supplement. Table and Figure numbers also
refer to the on-line supplement.
Results in Supplementary Table 2 show that RAxML-VI-HPC
clearly outperforms RAxML-V in terms of inference times. In addi-
tion, due to the usage of a ‘good’ rearrangement setting it also yields
significantly better log-likelihood values on the larger and more
diverse datasets 4000 taxa. Supplementary Figure 3 shows the
significant computational advantages of the GTR+CAT over the
GTR+G implementation in RAxML-VI.
Supplementary Tables 3–6 indicate that RAxML-VI-HPC out-
performs other current sequential phylogeny programs, on huge
datasets with respect to inference times, memory consumption as
well as final log-likelihood values. In addition, the performance
advantage with respect to run-times increases with growing align-
ment size (Supplementary Table 5). Another important result is that
the GTR+CAT approximation (Supplementary Table 3) can be used
to significantly reduce memory consumption and still yield signi-
ficantly better GTR+G likelihood values (Supplementary Table 4)
than competing programs.
GARLI terminated within approximately the same time as
RAxML-VI-HPC on the six smaller datasets and yielded the
second-best likelihood score in all cases. This is an astonishing
achievement for several reasons: GARLI implements a genetic
search algorithm and was executed under GTR+G. Moreover, it
maintains a whole population of trees in memory, including
some intelligently selected (Zwickl, 2006) partial likelihood vectors
as well as all tree topologies. Thus, it is expected to be slower than
the RAxML hill-climbing algorithm. This extraordinary perform-
ance is due to the sophisticated implementation of the likelihood
function and promising algorithmic ideas (Zwickl, 2006) such that
the forthcoming publication about GARLI is surely something to
look forward to. Note that, the parallel genetic search algorithm of
GARLI performs a distinct and more thorough search, that yields,
e.g. better final trees on the 1000 taxon alignment (Zwickl, 2006).
However, the focus of the current study is on the strictly sequential
versions of all programs.
The performance of the new version of MrBayes is also remark-
able. Given that it has to maintain four distinct Markov chains, the
relatively lowmemory consumption in combination with acceptable
likelihood values after 60 h under GTR+G, the performance is quite
impressive. As Bayesian inference conceptually differs from pure
ML-based inference, a comparison based on likelihood scores is
certainly not fair since it usesMrBayes as anML heuristic. MrBayes
has mainly been included owing to its popularity.
IQPNNI and PHYML both suffer from a relatively inefficient
technical implementation. The high memory consumption of
IQPNNI and PHYML is due to a different memory organization
which uses two likelihood vectors per branch (3n 6 vectors)
instead of one per inner node (n 2 vectors).
Moreover, PHYML uses NNI moves which only exploit a very
small fraction of the search space. A solution to this problem has
been proposed by Hordijk and Gascuel (2005). However, the
respective program is currently only available as proof-of-concept
implementation (W. Hordijk and O. Gascuel, personal communica-
tion) and cannot be used for large trees owing to numerical problems.
In the final analysis, it can be stated that technical implementation
aspects are becoming increasingly important and can yield signi-
ficant performance improvements. In addition, in all programs there
exist excellent algorithmic ideas which in the optimal case could
significantly advance the field, when merged into one program.
4 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The new version VI of RAxML has been presented, which incor-
porates efficient technical optimizations, parallel OpenMP- and
MPI-based implementations, and a mixed model implementation.
A thorough experimental study on large real-world datasets shows
that RAxML can find better trees with a significantly lower memory
consumption within similar or less time than the best competing
program.
Future work will mainly cover the development of new methods
for rapid bootstrapping. Despite the fact, that RAxML and GARLI
allow for inference of huge trees with ML in reasonable times,
conducting a full biological analysis still requires at least 100 or
1000 bootstraps which places the computational burden much
higher than for the inference of a single ML tree.
