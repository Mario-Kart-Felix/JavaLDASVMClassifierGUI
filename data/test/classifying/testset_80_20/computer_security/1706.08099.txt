Abstract
The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of encryption was invented
in 1976, and it is currently one of the most commonly used mode. In our
previous research works, we have proven that the CBC mode of operation
exhibits, under some conditions, a chaotic behavior. The dynamics of this
mode has been deeply investigated later, both qualitatively and quantita-
tively, using the rigorous mathematical topology field of research. In this
article, which is an extension of our previous work, we intend to compute
a new important quantitative property concerning our chaotic CBC mode
of operation, which is the Lyapunov exponent.
1 Introduction
Blocks ciphers, like Data Encryption Standard (DES) or Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES), have a very simple principle: they do not treat the original
text bit by bit but they manipulate blocks of text. More precisely, the plaintext
is broken into blocks of N bits. For each one, the encryption algorithm is applied
to obtain an encrypted block that has the same size. Then, we put together
all of these blocks, which are separately encrypted, to obtain the full encrypted
message. For decryption, we proceed in the same way, but now starting from
the ciphertext, in order to obtain the original one employing the decryption
algorithm in place of the encryption function. So it is not sufficient to put
anyhow a block cipher algorithm in a program. We can, instead, use these
algorithms in various ways according to their specific needs. These ways are
called block cipher modes of operation. Indeed, there are several modes and
each one of them differs from others by its own characteristics, in addition to its
specific security properties. In this article, we are only interested in the Cipher
Block Chaining mode and we will quantify its chaotic behavior thanks to the
Lyapunov exponent. To do so, we first show that such mode of operations can
be considered as dynamical systems.
Indeed, some dynamical systems are very sensitive to small changes in their
initial condition. Both constants of sensitivity to initial conditions and of expan-

sivity illustrate that [1, 2]. However, these variations can quickly take enormous
proportions, grow exponentially, and none of these constants can measure such a
behavior. Alexander Lyapunov has examined this phenomenon and introduced
an exponent that measures the rate at which these small variations can grow.
Definition 1 Let f : R −→ R. The Lyapunov exponent of the system defined
by x0 ∈ R and xn+1 = f(xn) is:
λ(x0) = lim
n→+∞
1
n
n∑
i=1
ln
∣∣ f ′ (xi−1)∣∣.
Consider a dynamical system with an infinitesimal error on the initial con-
dition x0. When the Lyapunov exponent is positive, this error will increase
(situation of chaos), whereas it will decrease if λ(x0) 6 0.
Example 1 The Lyapunov exponent of the logistic map x0 ∈ [0, 1], xn+1 =
µxn(1− xn) [3] becomes positive for µ > 3, 54, but it is always smaller than 1.
The tent map [4, 5] and the doubling map of the circle [6], two other well-known
chaotic dynamical systems, have a Lyapunov exponent equal to ln(2).
Sometimes, instead of trying to prove directly the properties on the system
itself, it is preferable to reduce the initial problem to another whose character-
istics are known or seem to be accessible. Such a reduction tool is called, in the
mathematical theory of chaos, the semi-conjugacy.
Definition 2 The discrete dynamical system (X , f) is topologically semi-conjugate
to the system (Y, g) if it exists a function ϕ : X −→ Y, both continuous and
onto, such that:
ϕ ◦ f = g ◦ ϕ,
that is, which makes commutative the following diagram [7].
X f−−−−→ X
ϕ
y yϕ
Y −−−−→
g
Y
In this case, the system (Y, g) is called a factor of the system (X , f).
Various dynamical behaviors are inherited by systems factors [7]. They are
summarized in the following proposition:
Proposition 1 Let (Y, g) a factor of the system (X , f). Then:
1. for all j 6 k, p ∈ Perk(f) =⇒ ϕ(p) ∈ Perj(g), where Pern(h) stands for
the set of points of period n for the iteration function h.
2. (X , f) regular =⇒ (Y, g) regular,
2
3. (X , f) transitive =⇒ (Y, g) transitive.
So if (X , f) is chaotic as defined by Devaney, then (Y, g) is chaotic too.
Having these materials in mind, it is now possible to measure the Lyapunov
exponent of some CBC mode of operations. Do do so, we will follow the canvas
described hereafter. In Section 2, some basic reminders are given. The semicon-
jugacy allowing the exponent evaluation is described in Section 3. In the next
one, the consequences of such a semi-conjugacy are outlined, and the exponent
is computed. This article ends by a conclusion section where our contribution
is summarized and intended future work is outlined.
2 Basic Recalls
2.1 The Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode
The CBC block cipher mode of operation presents a very popular way of en-
cryption that is used in numerous applications, despite the fact that encryption
in this mode can be performed only using one thread. Cipher block chaining is
a block cipher mode that provides confidentiality but not message integrity in
cryptography. The operating principle of this mode is to add XOR each sub-
sequent plain-text block to a cipher-text one that was previously received, see
Figure 1. Each subsequent cipher-text block depends on the previous one. Fi-
nally, the first plain-text block is added XOR to a random Initialization Vector
(commonly referred to as IV). This vector has the same size as all plain-text
blocks.
To decrypt cipher-text blocks, one should add XOR output data from de-
cryption algorithm to previous cipher-text blocks. The receiver knows all cipher-
text blocks just after obtaining encoded the message, thus he can decrypt the
message using many threads simultaneously. If one bit of a plain-text mes-
sage is damaged (for instance, because of some earlier transmission error), all
subsequent cipher-text blocks will be damaged and it will be never possible to
decrypt the cipher-text received from this plain-text. As opposed to that, if one
cipher-text bit is damaged, only two received plain-text blocks will be damaged.
Finally, note that a message that is to be encrypted using the CBC mode,
should be extended until being as long as a multiple of a single block length.
2.2 Modeling the CBC mode as a dynamical system
Our modeling follows a same canvas than what has be done for hash functions [8,
1] or pseudo-random number generation [9]. Let us consider the CBC mode of
operation with a keyed encryption function εk : B
N → BN depending on a
secret key k, where N is the size for the block cipher, and Dk : BN → BN is
the associated decryption function, which is such that ∀k, εk ◦Dk is the identity
function. We define the Cartesian product X = BN × SN, where:
• B = {0, 1} is the set of Boolean values,
3
(a) CBC encryption mode (b) CBC decryption mode
Figure 1: CBC mode of operation
• SN = J0, 2N−1KN, the set of infinite sequences of natural integers bounded
by 2N − 1, or the set of infinite N-bits block messages,
in such a way that XN is constituted by couples of internal states of the mode of
operation together with sequences of block messages. Let us consider the initial
function:
i : SN −→ J0, 2N − 1K
(mi)i∈N 7−→ m0
that returns the first block of a (infinite) message, and the shift function:
σ : SN −→ SN
(m0,m1,m2, ...) 7−→ (m1,m2,m3, ...)
which removes the first block of a message. Let mj be the j-th bit of integer,
or block message, m ∈ J0, 2N− 1K, expressed in the binary numeral system, and
when counting from the left. We define:
Ff : B
N × J0, 2N − 1K −→ BN
(x,m) 7−→ (xjmj + f(x)jmj)j=1..N
This function returns the inputted binary vector x, whose mj-th components
xmj have been replaced by f(x)mj , for all j = 1..N such that mj = 0. In case
where f is the vectorial negation, this function will correspond to one XOR
between the clair text and the previous encrypted state.
Denote by f0 the vectorial negation. So the CBC mode of operation can be
rewritten n a condensed way, as follows.{
X0 = (IV,m)
Xn+1 = (Ek ◦ Ff0 (i(Xn1 ), Xn2 ) , σ(Xn1 ))
(1)
For any given g : J0, 2N−1K×BN −→ BN, we denoteGg(X) = (g(i(X1), X2);σ(X1))
(when g = Ek ◦Ff0 , we obtain one cypher block of the CBC, as depicted in Fig-
ure 1). So the recurrent relation of Eq.(1) can be rewritten in a condensed way,
as follows.
Xn+1 = GEk◦Ff0 (X
n) . (2)
4
With such a rewriting, one iterate of the discrete dynamical system above cor-
responds exactly to one cypher block in the CBC mode of operation. Note that
the second component of this system is a subshift of finite type, which is related
to the symbolic dynamical systems known for their relation with chaos [10].
We then have defined a distance on XN as follows: d((x,m); (x̌, m̌)) =
de(x, x̌) + dm(m, m̌), where [11]:

.
in which δ(x, y) = 1 if x = y, else it is 0. Using this modeling, we have been
able to prove that [11],
Theorem 1 The CBC mode of operation GEk◦Ff0 is chaotic, as defined by De-
vaney [12], on the topological space (X , d). This means that GEk◦Ff0 has on
(X , d) the properties of:
• regularity: its set of periodic points is dense in XN (for any point x in XN,
any neighborhood of x contains at least one periodic point).
• topologically transitivity: for any pair of open sets U, V ⊂ XN, there exists
an integer k > 0 such that GkEk◦Ff0
(U) ∩ V 6= ∅.
• sensitive dependence on initial conditions: there exists δ > 0 such that,
for any x ∈ XN and any neighborhood V of x, there exist y ∈ V and n > 0
such that
d

> δ.
This result has been extended in [13], in which both expansivity and sensibility of
symmetric cyphers have been regarded in the case of the CBC mode of operation.
However, all these results of qualitative and quantitative disorder have been
stated on an exotic phase space XN, equipped with a distance d very different
from the usual Euclidian one. Our objective is now to translate them in a more
usual situation, namely the real line equipped with its usual order topology. To
do so, a topological semi-conjugacy must be introduced. Such a formulation
will make it possible to evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of the CBC mode, as
the latter will be described by a differentiable function on R.
3 A Topological Semi-conjugacy
3.1 The phase space is an interval of the real line
3.1.1 Toward a topological semi-conjugacy
We show, by using a topological semi-conjugacy, that CBC mode can be de-
scribed on a real interval. In what follows and for easy understanding, we will

assume that N = 10. However, an equivalent formulation of the following can
be easily obtained by replacing the base 10 by any base N.
Definition 3 The function ϕ : S10 ×B10 →
[
0, 210
[
is defined by:
ϕ : X10 = S10 ×B10 −→
[
0, 210
[
((S0, S1, . . .); (E0, . . . , E9)) 7−→ ϕ ((S,E))
where (S,E) = ((S0, S1, . . .); (E0, . . . , E9)), and ϕ ((S,E)) is the real number:
• whose integral part e is
9∑
k=0
29−kEk, that is, the binary digits of e are
E0 E1 . . . E9.
• whose decimal part s is equal to s = 0, S0 S1 S2 . . . =
∑+∞
k=1 10
−kSk−1.
ϕ realizes the association between a point of X10 and a real number into
[
0, 210
[
.
We must now translate the CBC process GEk◦Ff0 on this real interval. To do
so, two intermediate functions over
[
0, 210
[
must be introduced:
Definition 4 Let x ∈
[
0, 210
[
and:
• e0, . . . , e9 the binary digits of the integral part of x: bxc =
9∑
k=0
29−kek.
• (sk)k∈N the digits of x, where the chosen decimal decomposition of x is the
one that does not have an infinite number of 9: x = bxc+
+∞∑
k=0
sk10
−k−1.
6
e and s are thus defined as follows:
e :
[
0, 210
[
−→ B10
x 7−→ (e0, . . . , e9)
and
s :
[
0, 210
[
−→ J0, 9KN
x 7−→ (sk)k∈N
We are now able to define the function g, whose goal is to translate the CBC
mode GEk◦Ff0 on an interval of R.
Definition 5 g :
[
0, 210
[

[
0, 210
[
is defined by:
g :
[
0, 210

[
0, 210
[
x 7−→ g(x)
where g(x) is the real number of
[
0, 210

• its integral part is the number, encrypted by εk, whose binary decompo-

i = 1
• whose decimal part is m10, . . . ,m19, m20, . . . ,m29,m30, . . . ,m39, . . .
In other words, if x =

k=0

k=0
sk 10−k−1, then:
g(x) =

k=0
sk+110−k−1.
3.1.2 Defining a metric on
[
0, 210
[
Numerous metrics can be defined on the set
[
0, 210
[
, the most usual one being
the Euclidean distance ∆(x, y) =
√
y2 − x2. This Euclidean distance does not
reproduce exactly the notion of proximity induced by our first distance d on
X . Indeed d is finer than ∆. This is the reason why we have to introduce the
following metric:
Definition 6 Let x, y ∈
[
0, 210
[
. D denotes the function from
[
0, 210
[2
to R+
defined by: D(x, y) = De (e(x), e(y)) +Ds (s(x), s(y)), where:
De(E, Ě) =
9∑
k=0
δ(Ek, Ěk), and Ds(S, Š) =
∞∑
k=1
|sk − Šk|
10k
.
Proposition 2 D is a distance on
[
0, 210
[
.
7
Proof The three axioms defining a distance must be checked.
• D > 0, because everything is positive in its definition. If D(x, y) = 0,
then De(x, y) = 0, so the integral parts of x and y are equal (they have
the same binary decomposition). Additionally, Ds(x, y) = 0, then ∀k ∈
N∗, s(x)k = s(y)k. In other words, x and y have the same k−th decimal
digit, ∀k ∈ N∗. And so x = y.
• D(x, y) = D(y, x).
• Finally, the triangular inequality is obtained due to the fact that both δ
and |x− y| satisfy it.
The convergence of sequences according to D is not the same than the usual
convergence related to the Euclidean metric. For instance, if xn → x according
to D, then necessarily the integral part of each xn is equal to the integral part
of x (at least after a given threshold), and the decimal part of xn corresponds to
the one of x “as far as required”. To illustrate this fact, a comparison between
D and the Euclidean distance is given in Figure 2. These illustrations show
that D is richer and more refined than the Euclidean distance, and thus is more
precise.
3.1.3 The semi-conjugacy
It is now possible to define a topological semi-conjugacy between XN and an
interval of R which makes possible to translate the action of the CBC encryption
on a message in the form of a recurrent sequence on the interval
[
0, 210
[
.
Theorem 2 CBC mode on the phase space XN are simple iterations on R,
which is illustrated by the semi-conjugacy of the diagram below:(
S10 ×B10, d
) GEk◦Ff0−−−−−→ ( S10 ×B10, d )

0, 210
[
, D
)
−−−−→
g
( [
0, 210
[
, D
)
Proof ϕ has been constructed in order to be continuous and onto.
In other words, XN is approximately equal to
[
0, 2N
[
.
3.1.4 Comparing the metrics of
[
0, 2N
[
The two propositions below allow us to compare our two distances on
[
0, 2N
[
:
Proposition 3 The identity function Id:
( [
0, 2N
[
,∆
)
→
( [
0, 2N
[
, D
)
is not
continuous.
Proof The sequence xn = 1, 999 . . . 999 constituted by n 9’s as digits, is such
that:
8
• ∆(xn, 2)→ 0.
• But D(xn, 2) > 1, so D(xn, 2) does not converge to 0.
The sequential characterization of the continuity allows us to conclude the
proposition.
A contrario:
Proposition 4 Id:
( [
0, 2N
[
, D
)
→
( [
0, 2N
[
,∆
)
is continuous.
Proof On the one hand, if D(xn, x) → 0, then De(xn, x) = 0 at least after
a given rank, because De produces only integers. So, after a given rank, the
whole integral parts of xn are equal to the one of x.
On the other hand, Ds(x
n, x) → 0, so ∀k ∈ N∗,∃Nk ∈ N, n > Nk ⇒
Ds(x
n, x) 6 10−k. Which means that for all k, it exists a rank Nk after which
all the xn’s have the same k first digits, which are the ones of x. We can deduce
from all these aspects that ∆(xn, x)→ 0, which leads to the claimed result.
We can conclude from the previous propositions that the introduced metric
is more precise than the Euclidean distance. In other words:
Proposition 5 The distance D is finer than the Euclidean distance ∆.
This proposition can be reformulated as follows:
• The topology generated by ∆ is inside the one generated by D.
• D has more open sets than ∆.
• Figuratively, D allows a better observation, leading to more details than
∆.
• Finally, it is harder to converge with the topology τD generated by D,
than with the one generated by ∆, and denoted τ∆.
3.1.5 Impact of the topology
To alleviate notations, let us denote by Xτ the topological space (X , τ), and by
Vτ (x) the set of all neighborhoods of x when considering the τ topology. When
there is no ambiguity, we will simply use the notation V(x).
Theorem 3 Let XN be a set, and τ, τ ′ two topologies on XN such that τ ′ is finer
than τ . Let f : X → XN be a function continuous for both τ and τ ′.
If (Xτ ′ , f) is chaotic according to Devaney, then (Xτ , f) is chaotic too.
Proof Let us firstly introduce the transitivity of (Xτ , f).
Let ω1, ω2 be two open sets of τ . Then ω1, ω2 ∈ τ ′, as τ ′ is finer than τ .
But f is τ ′−transitive, so we can deduce that ∃n ∈ N, ω1 ∩ f (n)(ω2) = ∅. As a
consequence, f is τ−transitive.
9
Let us now establish the regularity of (Xτ , f), i.e., for all x ∈ XN, and for all
τ−neighborhood V of x, a periodic point for f can be found in V .
Let x ∈ XN and V ∈ Vτ (x) a τ−neighborhood of x. By definition of the
neighborhood notion, ∃ω ∈ τ, x ∈ ω ⊂ V .
But τ ⊂ τ ′, so ω ∈ τ ′, and as a consequence, V ∈ Vτ ′(x). As (Xτ ′ , f) is
regular, it exists a periodic point for f in V , and the regularity of (Xτ , f) is
proven.
3.2 CBC mode described as a real function
We will now show that the g function is a piecewise linear one: it is linear on
each interval having the form
[
n
10
,
n+ 1
10
[
, n ∈ J0; 210 × 10K and its slope is
equal to 10.
Proposition 6 CBC mode g defined on R have derivatives of all orders on[
0, 210
[
, except on the 10241 points in I defined by
{ n
10
/
n ∈ J0; 210 × 10K
}
.
Furthermore, on each interval of the form
[
n
10
,
n+ 1
10
[
, with n ∈ J0; 210×10K,
g is a linear function, having a slope equal to 10: ∀x /∈ I, g′(x) = 10.
Proof Let In =
[
n
10
,
n+ 1
10
[
, with n ∈ J0; 210 × 10K. All the points of In have
the same integral part e and the same decimal part s0: on the set In, functions
e(x) and x 7→ s(x)0 of Definition 4 only depend on n. So all the images g(x) of
these points x:
• Have the same integral part, which is εk(e), except probably the bit num-
ber s0. In other words, this integer has approximately the same binary
decomposition than εk(e), the sole exception being the digit s0 (this num-
ber is then either εk(e+ 2
10−s0) or εk(e−210−s0), depending on the parity
of s0, i.e., it is equal to εk(e+ (−1)s0 × 210−s0)).
• A shift to the left has been applied to the decimal part y, losing by doing
so the common first digit s0. In other words, y has been mapped into
10× y − s0.
To sum up, the action of g on the points of I is as follows: first, make a
multiplication by 10, and second, add the same constant to each term, which is
1
10
(
εk(e+ (−1)s0 × 210−s0)
)
− s0.
Remark 1 CBC mode is then an element of the large family of functions that
are both chaotic and piecewise linear (like the tent map [4, 5]).
We are now able to evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of our chaotic CBC mode,
which is now described by the iterations on R of the g function introduced in
Definition 5.
10
4 Disorder generated by CBC formulated on R
4.1 Devaney’s chaos on the real line
We have established in [11] that the CBC mode of operation
(
GEk◦Ff0 ,Xd
)
satisfies the Devaney’s definition of chaos. From the semi-conjugacy, we can
deduce that it is the case too for the mode of operation on R with the order
topology, as:
•
(
GEk◦Ff0 ,Xd
)
and
(
g,
[
0, 210
[
D
)
are semi-conjugated by ϕ,
• ϕ
(
g,
[
0, 210
[
D
)
is a chaotic system according to Devaney, because the
semi-conjugacy preserves such a character [7].
• But the topology generated by D is finer than the one generated by the
euclidean distance ∆ – which is the order topology [5].
• According to Theorem 3, we can deduce that the CBC mode of operation
g is chaotic, as defined by Devaney, for the usual order topology on R.
We can formulate this result as follows.
Theorem 4 The CBC mode of operation g on R satisfies the Devaney’s chaos
property, when R is equipped with its usual topology (the order one).
Indeed this result is weaker than Theorem 1, that established the chaos of
iterates on a finer topology. This can be explained in the following figurative
manner. By using tools that are usual in the discrete dynamical system field,
we can only observe disorder in the iterations of the CBC mode of operation
(Theorem 4). And even if we considered an higher resolution, and more powerful
tools than the ones that are commonly used, we still fail in finding order in such
a chaos (Theorem 1).
Result of Theorem 4 is still precious. Indeed, we have started to formulate
the mode of operation on a set different from the one commonly considered
(XN instead of R), to be as close as possible to the computer machine (dealing
with bounded integer), and so to prevent from losing disorder properties when
switching from theory to computer program. It is to be feared that this intro-
duction of discrete iterations can only be paid by the obtention of disorders of
lower quality. In other words, perhaps we moved from a situation of a good
disorder lost when computed on finite state machines, to a disorder preserved
but of poor quality. Theorem 4 shows exactly the contrary of this claim.
4.2 Evaluation of the Lyapunov Exponent
Let L =
{
x0 ∈
[
0, 210
[ /
∀n ∈ N, xn /∈ I
}
, where I is the set of points in the
real interval where g is not differentiable (as it is explained in Proposition 6).
We have the following result.
Theorem 5 Let us consider the CBC mode of operation with block size of N .
Then, ∀x0 ∈ L, its Lyapunov exponent is equal to λ(x0) = ln(N).

Proof The function g is piecewise linear, with a slop of 10, as g′(x) = 10 where
g is differentiable. Then ∀x ∈ L, λ(x) = limn→+∞

Remark 2 The set of initial vectors for which this exponent is not defined is
countable. This is indeed the initial conditions such that an iteration value will
be a number having the form
n
10
, with n ∈ N. We can reach such a real number
only by starting iterations on a decimal number, as this latter must have a finite
fractional part.
Remark 3 For a system having N cells, we will find, mutatis, an infinite un-
countable set of initial conditions x0 ∈
[
0; 2N
[
such that λ(x0) = ln(N).
So, it is possible to make the Lyapunov exponent of our CBC mode as large
as possible, depending on the size of the block message.
5 Conclusion and Future work
We have available now a new quantitative property concerning the CBC mode
of operation: its Lyapunov exponent is equal to ln(N), where N is the size of
the block message. This exponent allows to quantify how the ignorance on the
exact initial vector increases after several iterations of the mode of operation.
It illustrates the disorder generated by iterations of such a process, reinforcing
its chaotic nature.
Using the semi-conjugacy described here, it will be possible in a future work
to compare the topological behavior of various modes of operation on XN and on
R. This semi-conjugacy can be used to investigate various interesting directions,
as to have a new understanding of the modes of operations while considering
them as iterations on the real line. Their dynamics can be better understood
thanks to the use of mathematical analyzis tools. Finally, elements of compari-
son with usual iteration ways can be provided too, as we will consider the same
iteration set, namely the real line.
