1 A story
Mr Holt, the kindergarten teacher, gives his class these instructions:
Hello class, The Metropolitan Museum of Art is at a sudden shortage
of sculptures and needs several new ones to fill its shelves. Please break
into groups so that each group can build a Lego tower. The director of
the museum will be here in an hour to pick up the towers and put them
in the museum with your names on them. Please do the best job you
can; you don’t want to be professionally embarrassed.
Each kindergartener wants to be in a group with her friends, but she also wants
her friends to be happy in the group; she don’t want her friends to be miserable.
The graph below is a map of who is friends with who in the small class. See a
would have more friends in the group {a, b, c, d, e} than {a, b, c, d}, but maybe a
doesn’t want to e to be in the group because a knows it will make b, c, and d
less happy. Strangely, a prefers {a, b, c, d} to {a, b, c, d, e}.
You can imagine that the kindergarteners might try to choose the best group
in some other way. The class would split into groups one way, but then people
would be unhappy and keep changing. How can we model all this? How could
we easily visualize all this?
2 Hedonic games
Below is the original definition of a hedonic game. Hedonic games were invented
to model the formation and deformation of groups.

Definition 1. Banerjee, Konishi, and Sönmez [2] A coalition formation game
is a pair G = (N, (i)i∈N ), where N is a finite set of players and for every i ∈ N ,
i is a reflexive, complete, and transitive binary relation on N i = {C ∈ 2N :
i ∈ C}. Strict preference relation and the indifference relation are denoted by 
and ∼ respectively.
Definition 2. [2] A coalition structure Γ = {C1, . . . , Ck} is a partition of
N . The coalition containing a player i ∈ N is denoted Γ (i). Any subset of N is
called a coalition.
That’s a very minimal definition, and these most general hedonic games don’t
have many computationally useful properties. For that reason, several subclasses
of hedonic games have been invented and studied.
2.1 The core
There are ways you can ask the question “Is this coalition formation stable?”
Seven good ways of asking are considered by Nguyen et al. [4]. One of the most
important ways to ask the question (and the focus of a survey by Woeginger [5])
is “Is this this coalition formation core-stable?”.
Definition 3. In a hedonic game G with a partition Γ , if there is a nonempty
set C ⊆ N where ∀i ∈ C : C i Γ (i), then we say that C blocks Γ , or C is a
blocking coalition in Γ . If Γ cannot be blocked, then it is called core-stable.
The set of core-stable partitions for a game G is called the core of G.
3 Varieties of Hedonic Games
In the below paragraphs, n = |N | is the number of players, i is a player in N ,
and C,D ∈ N i are coalitions which contain i.
3.1 Fractional Hedonic Games
Aziz, Brandt, and Harrenstein [1] In fractional hedonic games, i assigns
some real value vi(j) to every player j ∈ N . It’s assumed that vi(i) = 0. We say
C FRi D if uFRi (C) ≥ uFRi (D), where
uFR(C) =
∑
j∈C
vi(j).
Aziz et al. show that even in simple (vi(j) ∈ {0, 1}) and symmetric (vi(j) =
vj(i)) fractional hedonic games, the core is sometimes empty and that checking
core emptiness is Σp2 -complete.
3.2 Friend and Enemy Oriented Hedonic Games
Dimitrov, Borm, Hendrickx, and Sung [3] In both of these kinds of games, i
splits the other players in N into a set of friends, Fi, and a set of enemies, Ei.
In friend-oriented games, i prefers coalitions with more friends and breaks
ties by considering the number of enemies. In other words,
C FOi D
⇐⇒ |C ∩ Fi| > |D ∩ Fi| ∨ (|C ∩ Fi| = |D ∩ Fi| ∧ |C ∩ Ei| ≤ |D ∩ Ei|)
⇐⇒ uFOi (C) ≥ uFOi (D)
where uFOi (C) = n|C ∩ Fi| − |C ∩ Ei|.
So if C has 8 friends and 600 enemies and C has 7 friends and 0 enemies, then
i would still rather be in C.
In enemy-oriented games, i tries to minimize enemies and only considers
friends to break a tie. In other words,
C EOi D
⇐⇒ |C ∩ Ei| < |D ∩ Ei| ∨ (|C ∩ Ei| = |D ∩ Ei| ∧ |C ∩ Fi| ≥ |D ∩ Fi|)
⇐⇒ uEOi (C) ≥ uEOi (D)
where uEOi (C) = |C ∩ Fi| − n|C ∩ Ei|.
Dimitrov et al. show that the core is guaranteed to be non-empty in both
kinds of games. However, finding a core-stable partition is NP-hard in enemy-
oriented games1 but polynomial in friend-oriented games.
3.3 Altruistic Hedonic Games
Nguyen, Rey, Rey, Rothe, and Schend [4] Also in altruistic hedonic games, i
divides the other players into friends, Fi, and enemies, Ei. The idea is that a
player wouldn’t want to be in a coalition where his friends were miserable, even
if he had a large number of friends.
Three levels of altruism are considered. Let avg(S) =
∑
x∈S x/|S| denote the
average of a multiset of numbers. And, like above, the ui(C) for each category
means C i D ⇐⇒ ui(C) ≥ ui(D).
In selfish-first altruistic games, a player cares most about his own hap-
piness and uses his friends’ preferences to break ties. ‘Happiness’ here means
the friend-oriented score. This is distinct from friend-oriented games in that a
tightly connected coalition C with 6 friends and 3 enemies is preferred to a sparse
coalition with D 6 friends and 3 enemies, because i’s friends in C are happier
than i’s friends in D.
uSFi (C) = n
5uFOi (C) + avg(u
FO
j (C) : j ∈ C ∩ Fi).
1 More precisely, if you could find a core-stable coalition structure in polynomial time,
then you could find the largest clique in a simple graph in polynomial time.
In equal-treatment altruistic games, a player takes his and all his friends’
opinions into equal account when evaluating a partition:
uEQi (C) = avg(u
FO
j (C) : j ∈ C ∩ Fi ∪ {i}).
And in altruistic-treatment altruistic games (i.e. truly altruistic games), a
player prefers coalitions where his friends are happy and breaks ties by consid-
ering his own happiness.
uALi (C) = u
FO
i (C) + n
5avg(uFOj (C) : j ∈ C ∩ Fi).
Nguyen et al. show that selfish-first altruistic games always have an nonempty
core. Whether equal-treatment altruistic games and truly altruistic games ever
have empty cores is an open question. I suspect that the core is always nonempty
in both games.
4 The Simulator
I wrote software to simulate hedonic games and put in on the internet. You can
draw graphs, choose partitions, choose several different player types, and check
the stability of the partition under several different measures. Hopefully this will
help others and myself quickly understand different hedonic games and speed up
the process of finding stable partitions.
