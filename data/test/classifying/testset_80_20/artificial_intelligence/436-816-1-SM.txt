Abstract. Artificial Intelligence is a part of computer science concerned with designing intelligent computer 
systems that exhibit the characteristics used to associate with intelligence in human behavior. Basically, it define 
as a field that study and design of intelligent agents. Traditional AI approach deals with cognitive and biological 
models that imitate and describe human information processing skills. This processing skills help to perceive 
and interact with their environment. But in modern era developers can build system that assemble superior 
information processing needs of government and industry by choosing from large areas of mature technologies. 
Soft Computing is an added area of AI. It focused on the design of intelligent systems that process uncertain, 
imprecise and incomplete information. It applied in real world problems frequently to offer more robust, 
tractable and less costly solutions than those obtained by more conventional mathematical techniques. This 
paper reviews correlation of artificial intelligence techniques with soft computing in various areas. 
Keyword. Artificial intelligence; Soft computing; Correlation; Engineering and science. 
 
INTRODUCTION 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) [1, 2] is intelligence exhibited by machines. It is a human-like intelligent models for 
decision making. It perceives its own environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some 
goal. According to the father of AI, John McCarthy, it is the science and engineering of making intelligent 
machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled 
robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think. The most important 
element of AI is an agent that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success 
and reduce the complexity of system. It helps to solve real world problems by coping uncertainty of reasoning 
into incomplete knowledge to make strong analytical and planning systems. During solving the problem its 
deals with several phases such as planning, learning, perception and ability to move and manipulate target 
entity. Whereas Soft Computing (SC) [3, 4] is a sub-discipline of AI. It is used in unpredictable situation where 
uncertainties related to information is more. It is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and 
approximation. Correlation of AI techniques with SC is a broad class of statistical relationships that involves 
dependency though in common usage of constituent elements of AI with SC techniques.

WORKING PRINCIPLE OF AI 
Computers making decisions in real-world problems by the helps of AI. It has an intelligent behaviour with 
perception. We perceive the world around us by the helps of five basic senses shown in Fig. 1. But in AI first 
three are the main elements. When we perceive some signal may be sound or light then we properly respond that 
signal. To generate proper response we must categorize or analyse that signal. Machine do same as human by 
applying and formulating design information with human intelligence and finally solve the real world problem. 
This process illustrates in Fig. 2.

CORRELATION OF AI TECHNIQUES WITH SC TECHNIQUE 
Correlation of AI with SC become a tool that has strong ability to deal any real world problem efficiently. A 
major thrust of this correlation in industrial and engineering applications that it associated with computer 
function with human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem solving. In modern era, it become 
most growing part of our societies. It’s rapidly growing areas which illustrates in Fig. 3. The application areas of 
AI increases day by day. In Fig. 3 the dotted line indicates that its area expanded in future also.

MATHEMATICAL MODELLING FOR CORRELATION OF AI TECHNIQUES WITH SC 
Mathematical model for correlation of AI techniques with SC is illustrated in Fig. 4. Description of this model is 
given below. 
 
Figure 4. Mathematical modelling of correlation of AI with SC. 
Let AIT, SCT, HCT and HBT are different sets for Artificial Intelligence Techniques, Soft Computing 
Techniques, Hard Computing Techniques and Hybrid Computing Techniques. All sets and its correlation are 
given in Eq. 1 to Eq. 4. 
AIT = {a1, a2, a3, . . . . . . . . , an}   (1) 
SCT = {s1, s2, s3, . . . . . . . . , sn}   (2) 
HCT = {h1, h2, h3, . . . . . . . . ,hn}   (3) 
HBT = {b1, b2, b3, . . . . . . . . ,bn}   (4) 
Relation among four sets are given as Eq. 5 to Eq. 8. 
SCT  AIT     (5) 
HBT  HCT     (6) 
HBT  SCT     (7) 
HBT  HCT ∩ SCT    (8) 
The above correlation highlight that area of HBT increases based on new domain problems. Hence, area of SCT 
and AIT. 
SEVERAL AI TECHNIQUES WITH SC IN VARIOUS AREAS 
The correlation of AI techniques with SC components helps to solve the complex problems in more human like 
fashion and in relatively very less time than a human takes. This technique are increases rapidly in numerous 
areas such as Agriculture, Civil engineering, Computer engineering, Industrial automation and manufacturing, 
Management and finance, Medical computing, Robotics, Short term load forecasting, Transportation, Water 
resource management, Material science, Fault diagnosis, Signal processing etc. Some constituent techniques are 
defined below. 
EXPERT SYSTEM 
Expert system is also known as decision maker. It is computer program that attempts to act like a human expert 
on a particular subject area to solve particular unpredictable problem. Sometime it is often used to advise non-
