ABSTRACT
IEEE 802.11 based wireless networks have seen rapid growth
and deployment in the recent years. Critical to the 802.11
MAC operation, is the handoff function which occurs when
a mobile node moves its association from one access point to
another. In this paper, we present an empirical study of this
handoff process at the link layer, with a detailed breakup of
the latency into various components. In particular, we show
that a MAC layer function - probe is the primary contributor
to the overall handoff latency. In our study, we observe
that the latency is significant enough to affect the quality
of service for many applications (or network connections).
Further we find a large variation in the latency with from
one handoff to another and also among APs and STAs used
from different vendors. In this study, we account for this
variation and also draw the guidelines for future handoff
schemes.

1. INTRODUCTION
IEEE 802.11 based wireless local area networks (WLANs)
have seen immense growth in the last few years. The pre-
dicted deployment of these networks for the next decade re-
sembles that of the Internet during the early 90s. In public
places such as campus and corporations, WLAN provides
not only convenient network connectivity but also a high

speed link up to 11 Mbps (802.11b). In this paper, we are
concerned with the IEEE 802.11b network which operates
in the 2.4 GHz range.
The IEEE 802.11 network MAC specification [4] allows for
two operating modes namely, the ad hoc and the infras-
tructure mode. In the ad hoc mode, two or more wireless
stations (STAs) recognize each other and establish a peer-
to-peer communication without any existing infrastructure,
whereas in infrastructure mode there is a fixed entity called
an access point (AP) that bridges all data between the mo-
bile stations associated to it. An AP and associated mobile
stations form a Basic Service Set (BSS) communicating on
the unlicensed RF spectrum.
A collection of APs (connected through a distribution sys-
tem DS) can extend a BSS into an Extended Service Set
(ESS refer figure 1).
A Handoff occurs when a mobile station moves beyond the
radio range of one AP, and enters another BSS (at the
MAC layer). During the handoff, management frames are
exchanged between the station (STA) and the AP. Also
the APs involved may exchange certain context information
(credentials) specific to the station. Consequently, there is
latency involved in the handoff process during which the
STA is unable to send or receive traffic.
Because of the mobility-enabling nature of wireless networks,
there is opportunity for many promising multimedia and
peer-to-peer applications (such as VoIP [3], 802.11 phones,
mobile video conferencing and chat). Also, many believe
that WLANs may become or supplement via hot spots the
next generation 4G wireless networks. Unfortunately, the
network connection as perceived by the application can suf-
fer from the jittery handoff latencies. As a matter of fact,
our measurements not only show that the latencies are very
high, but also show that they vary significantly for the same
configuration of STAs and APs.
Despite the growing popularity of WLANs, there has been
no prior measurement based analysis of the handoff pro-
cess. There is prior work on performance measurement in
ATM-based wireless networks ( [12], [8], [15] ) and cellular
wireless networks ([13]). In [2], Balachandran et. al. present
an empirical characterization of user behavior and network
performance in a public wireless LAN where they show the
varying number of handoffs with time. There has been work
on new handoff schemes in [14], [10],[11] and [7] focusing on
reducing WLAN handoff latency, but none of these efforts
have measured the current handoff latency.
In this study, we conduct experiments to accurately mea-
sure the handoff latency in an in-building wireless network.
The measurements are done on two co-existing wireless net-
works (utilizing APs from two popular vendors), and using
three wireless NICs from different vendors. We analyze the
handoff latencies by breaking down the whole process into
various phases to assess the contribution of each phase to
the handoff latency. Our results show that the probe phase
is the significant contributor to the handoff latency and the
variations in the probe-wait time account for the large vari-
ations in the overall handoff latency.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives
details about the handoff process as specified by the stan-
dard. Section 3 explains the methodology used for taking
the measurements. We present the analysis and results in
section 4. Section 5 concludes the study.
2. THE HANDOFF PROCESS
The handoff function or process refers to the mechanism or
sequence of messages exchanged by access points and a sta-
tion resulting in a transfer of physical layer connectivity and
state information from one AP to another with respect to the
station in consideration. Thus the handoff is a physical layer
function carried out by at least three participating entities,
namely the station, a prior-AP and a posterior-AP. The AP
to which the station had physical layer connectivity prior to
the handoff is the prior-AP, while the AP to which the sta-
tion gets connectivity after the handoff is the posterior-AP.
The state information that is transferred typically consists
of the client credentials (which allow it to gain network ac-
cess) and some accounting information. This transfer can
be achieved by an (currently draft [5]) Inter Access Point
Protocol(IAPP), or via a proprietary protocol. For an IEEE
802.11 network that has no access control mechanism, there
would be a nominal difference between a complete associa-
tion and a handoff / reassociation. Looking at it another
way, the handoff-latency would be strictly greater than as-
sociation latency as there is an additional inter-access point
communication delay involved.
2.1 Logical steps in a handoff
The complete handoff process can be divided into two dis-
tinct logical steps:(i) Discovery and (ii) Reauthentication as
described below. Later we shall see that the actual sequence
of messages exchanged perform either one of these two func-
tions.
1. Discovery: Attributing to mobility, the signal strength
and the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal from a station’s
current AP might degrade and cause it to loose connectivity
and to initiate a handoff. At this point, the client might not
be able to communicate with its current AP. Thus, the client
needs to find the potential APs (in range) to associate to.
This is accomplished by a MAC layer function: scan. Dur-
ing a scan, the card listens for beacon messages (sent out
periodically by APs at a rate of 10 ms), on assigned chan-
nels. Thus the station can create a list of APs prioritized
by the received signal strength.
There are two kinds of scanning methods defined in the stan-
dard : active and passive. As the names suggest, in the ac-
tive mode, apart from listening to beacon messages (which is
passive), the station sends additional probe broadcast pack-
ets on each channel and receives responses from APs. Thus
the station actively probes for the APs.
2. Reauthentication: The station attempts to reauthenti-
cate to an AP according to the priority list. The reauthenti-
cation process typically involves an authentication and a re-
association to the posterior AP. The reauthentication phase
involves the transfer of credentials and other state infor-
mation from the old-AP. As mentioned earlier, this can be
achieved through a protocol such as IAPP [5]. In the ex-
periments detailed in this paper, we do not have the draft
standard IAPP communication setup but the proprietary
inter-access point communications were allowed (between
APs of the same vendor). Thus the authentication phase
is just a null authentication in our experiments.

1. Probe Delay: Messages A to E are the probe mes-
sages from an active scan. Consequently, we call the
latency for this process, probe delay. The actual num-
ber of messages during the probe process may vary
from 3 to 11.
2. Authentication Delay: This is the latency incurred
during the exchange of the authentication frames (mes-
sages E and F ). Authentication consists of two or
four consecutive frames depending on the authentica-
tion method used by the AP. Some wireless NICs try
to initiate reassociation prior to authentication, which
introduces an additional delay in the handoff process
and is also a violation of the IEEE 802.11 [4] state
machine.
3. Reassociation Delay: This is the latency incurred
during the exchange of the reassociation frames (mes-
sages G and H ). Upon successful authentication pro-
cess, the station sends a reassociation request frame to
the AP and receives a reassociation response frame and
completes the handoff. Future implementations will
include additional IAPP messages during this phase
which will further increase the reassociation delay.
As a note, according to our analysis presented above, the
messages during the probe delay form the discovery phase,
while the authentication and reassociation delay form the
reauthentication phase. Apart from the latencies discussed
above, there will potentially be a bridging delay caused
by the time taken for the MAC address updates (using the
IEEE 802.1d protocol) to the ethernet switches which form
the distribution system (the backbone ethernet). The results
in our experiments will not reflect this latency. In the next
section we describe the details of the experiment.

cent AP
3. DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENT
As mentioned earlier, the experimental setup consists of two
in-building wireless networks, a mobile wireless client, and
a mobile sniffer system. As shown in figure 3 , the basic
methodology behind the experiments, is to use the sniffer
Figure 5: Handoff Latencies - Cisco STA with Lucent
AP
Figure 6: Handoff Latencies - ZoomAir STA with
Lucent AP
(physically well within RF range of the client at all times)
to capture all packets related to the client for the analysis.
Wireless Network Environment: All the experiments
were done in the A.V. Williams Building at the University of
Maryland, College Park campus. The building hosts two co-
existing wireless networks namely cswireless and umd. The
experiments were done in the overlapping coverage area of
both networks. The cswireless network consists primarily of
Lucent APs while the umd network consists of Cisco APs.
The cswireless network density is approximately 6 APs per
floor of the building while that of umd is approximately 8
APs per floor. The channel allocation for the networks is
done so that there is no interference between adjacent APs
i.e. the proper channels are set for the radio transmission
and reception of APs so that no adjacent APs are using the
same channel. In this experiment, channel 1, 6 and 11 are
used for the wireless communication.
Client Setup: For the mobile station, we used OpenBSD
3.1 on a HP Omnibook 500 with Pentium III 700 MHz and
384 MB RAM. The following wireless cards were used at
the mobile station during the experiment: Lucent Orinoco
Gold, Cisco Aironet 340 and ZoomAir Prism 2.
Figure 7: Handoff Latencies - Lucent STA with Cisco
AP
Figure 8: Handoff Latencies - Cisco STA with Cisco
AP
The experiments were done in the following manner. A per-
son with the mobile station walks through the building fol-
lowing a fixed path of travel (to minimize effects from the
layout of APs) during each run. The duration of the walk,
which is the duration of a single run of the experiment is ap-
proximately 30 minutes. Each experiment is characterized
by the (i) Wireless NIC used at the mobile station and (ii)
the Wireless network used. The mobile client sends negligi-
ble periodic ICMP messages to the network to maintain and
display connectivity. Thus as the station moves, it performs
handoffs as it leaves a BSS and enters another.
Collection of Data: During a handoff, a set of manage-
ment frames such as probe, authentication and reassociation
frames, are exchanged between the APs and the mobile sta-
tion. By collecting every management frame from the RF
medium (with timestamps) we compute the handoff delay as
the interval between the first probe request frame and reas-
sociation response frame (figure 2). Also the time spent for
each phase such as probe, authentication and reassociation
phase was obtained. This analysis is done offline.
In order to capture every management frame in the RF
medium we designed a separate IEEE 802.11 sniffing sys-
tem that is also mobile and in close proximity so that they
Figure 9: Handoff Latencies - ZoomAir STA with
Cisco AP
share the same RF medium with the client. Since neigh-
boring APs are using different channels, the sniffing system
should be able to capture frames in all three channels used,
i.e, 1, 6 and 11, simultaneously.
The wireless cards based on the Intersil Prism 2 chipset have
a monitor mode [1] which enables applications to read raw
IEEE 802.11 frames on one particular channel. Thus by
capturing traffic from three cards (on channels 1, 6, 11),
we are able to sniff all packets transmitted by participating
entities in the common RF medium. Other approaches that
use one wireless NIC and hop among channels, are bound
to miss up to an upper bound of 66% of the traffic. During
our experiments using the Cisco Aironet card to capture
packets [9], we observed a miss-rate of around 30% (from
experiments by sending parallel traffic on all three channels).
To sniff multiple channels, we set up two Linux machines,
one with one wireless card and the other with two wireless
cards which sniff three different channels independently. To
preclude the inaccuracy caused by the inconsistencies of the
system clock in the two machines, we synchronized their
times using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) through an
ethernet connection between the machines. Throughout the
experiment, we maintained a clock accuracy of 80 µs or
better between the machines (an error of less than 0.08%
for latency of 100 µs ). These linux machines we used are
IBM ThinkPad laptops with Pentium III 866 MHz and 256
MB RAM. A network sniffer program, ethereal and Prism
2 wireless cards in Hostap1 mode are used for sniffing the
IEEE 802.11 management frames.

Figure 10: The Handoff Procedure as observed using
ZoomAir wireless NICs.
1. Probe delay is the dominating component: Look-
ing at the six graphs, (figures 4,5,6,7,8,9) its clear that
the probe delay accounts for more than 90% of the
overall handoff delay, regardless of the particular STA,
AP combination. Also even in the number of mes-
sages exchanged between the STA and the APs in-
volved, the probe phase accounts for more than 80%
of these in all cases. Thus any handoff scheme that
uses techniques/heuristics that either cache or deduce
AP information without having to actually perform a
complete active scan clearly stand to benefit from the
dominating cost of the scan process.
2. The wireless hardware used (AP,STA) affects
the handoff latency: Looking at the differences in
the Y scale among the six graphs, one can readily draw
this conclusion. We can warrant this conclusion by
observing two facts. Firstly, keeping the AP fixed, we
can see that the client wireless card affects the latency.
Figure 11 compares the average values of the latency
among all six configurations. In each half of the figure
(i.e keeping the AP fixed), we can see a maximum
average difference of 335.53 ms (Lucent STA and Cisco
STA with Cisco AP). This is a huge variation by just
changing the client card being used. Secondly, keeping
the client card fixed, the AP also affects the latency
but to a much lower extent (around 50% less). This
can be inferred by looking at figure 11 and noting that
the maximum average difference (between the two APs
Figure 11: The average values of handoff latencies
among all configurations.
Figure 12: The standard deviation of handoff laten-
cies among all configurations.
for any fixed client) is 186.47 ms (Lucent AP vs Cisco
AP for ZoomAir STA) (and a minimum of 52.64ms).
3. There are large variations in the handoff la-
tency: Apart from the variations in the latency with
different configurations, we can see significant varia-
tions in the latency from one handoff to another within
the same configuration. Figure 13 shows the maximum
difference between any two latency values within a par-
ticular AP-STA configuration ( i.e. the |Max−Min|).
Also 12 shows the standard deviation values of the
handoff latencies for all configurations. From these
graphs, it is again clear that the particular AP-STA
being used affects the extent of variations. For exam-
ple, the maximum variation for a fixed AP (i.e max-
imum of |Max −Min|) happens between Lucent and
ZoomAir STAs with Lucent AP (a variation of 178.96
ms). Also for the same STA, we can see that the Cisco
APs have a lower variation (standard deviation) than
the Lucent APs.
4. Different wireless cards follow different sequence
of messages: This is an observation from looking at
the traces offline. We found that the ZoomAir Prism
2 cards follow a slightly different procedure than the
rest, as shown in figure 10. The figure shows that the
card sends a reassociate message prior to authentica-
tion which it does when the AP sends a deauthenti-
cation message. The figure also shows the modified
semantics of the reassociation delay and the authen-
Figure 13: The Max-Min for various handoff laten-
cies.
Figure 14: The Effect of the Number of Probe Re-
sponses on the Probe-Wait Time (Cisco STA and
Cisco AP)
tication delay for the ZoomAir cards. This sequence
of messages for a reauthentication, violates the IEEE
802.11 state machine as specified in the standard [4].
The probe delay being accountable for the high handoff la-
tency and the variations, we present further analysis of this
process. The probe is essentially an active scan (the wireless
NICs do by default), and hence an analysis of the messages
and latencies in the active scan is discussed below.
The probe function: The probe function is the IEEE
802.11 MAC active scan function and the standard specifies
a scanning procedure as follows (modified for brevity):
For each channel to be scanned,
1. Send a probe request with broadcast destination, SSID,
and broadcast BSSID.
2. Start a ProbeTimer.
3. If medium is not busy before the ProbeTimer reaches
MinChannelTime, scan the next channel, else when
ProbeTimer reaches MaxChannelTime, process all re-
ceived probe responses and proceed to next channel.

sponses on the Probe-Wait Time (Cisco STA and
Cisco AP) - Bar Graph
Figure 16: The Effect of the Number of Probe Re-
sponses on the Probe-Wait Time (Lucent STA and
Cisco AP)
Figure 18 shows the messages in a probe phase. The STA
transmits a probe request message and waits for responses
from APs on each channel. Let Probe-Wait latency be the
time an STA waits on one particular channel after sending
the probe request. We measure this as the time difference
between subsequent probe request messages. Thus accord-
ing to the above procedure, the traffic on the channel and
the timing of probe response messages affects the probe-
wait time, i.e. the probe-wait time should be expected to
be distributed between a MinChannelTime and a MaxChan-
nelTime value. For the probe phase analysis, we study two
experiments with the following setup : (i) Cisco STA and
Cisco AP, and (ii) Lucent STA and Cisco AP.
Figure 14 shows the various probe-wait times with respect
to the number of probe response messages received by the
STA. This plot is for the Cisco STA and Cisco AP combi-
nation. The scatter-plot shows two clusters being formed,
which more-or-less correspond to the MinChannelTime and
MaxChannelTime values from the above active scan proce-
dure. This clustering is further elucidated in figure 15 which
shows that the probe-wait time tends to be within 0 and
20ms for less than 2 probe response messages, otherwise it
tends to be within a short interval of 35 to 40ms. Thus the
number of probe response messages can create a difference
of atleast 15ms (and an average of 25ms) per channel. This

explains the high standard deviation that we observe in the
overall handoff latencies.
To compare with Lucent STA and Cisco AP combination,
figure 16 shows the variation in the probe-wait time with the
number of probe responses. This graph shows that there is
a positive correlation between the two quantities, but also
there is large variation in the probe-wait time for the same
number of probe responses. Figure 17 shows the overall
probe delay with the number of probe responses. Thus on
the overall, for Lucent STAs and Cisco APs, there is a posi-
tive correlation between number of probe responses and the
probe delay. Contrasting with the earlier experiment, we do
not find any clusters that correspond to the MinChannel-
Time and MaxChannelTime values, but rather we find an
almost uniform distribution. Also the probe-wait times for
the Lucent STA are on an average less than the correspond-
ing values for Cisco STA with respect to Cisco APs. Albeit
the contrasting results, we can see a maximum difference of
around 18 ms among the various probe-wait times for the
same number of probe responses and a maximum difference
of around 25 ms regardless of the probe responses. This vari-
ation is similar to that seen in the earlier experiment and
accounts for the large overall variation in the probe delay.
From the above analysis we can draw the following conclu-
sions :
1. The distribution of the probe-wait time has a defi-
nite positive correlation (in direct proportion) with the
number of probe response messages received (figure 16
and 17).
2. For the same number of probe responses, the distribu-
tion of the probe wait time depends on the particu-
lar heuristic used by the client card. For instance, the
Cisco card has values clustered around two parameters
while the Lucent card has a near-uniform distribution
(figure 16 and 17).
There are some guidelines for handoff heuristics that one
can deduce after looking at the results. Primarily, heuristics
that require the least number of active scans will perform
the best. The following methods (or a combination of them)
might be used to design heuristics and these are all attempts
to avoid an active scan:
1. Query an external agent that provides hints on the
neighboring APs and channels i.e a map of the APs
based on the location. Pack et. al. in [11], [10] propose
a technique in this category.
2. Interleave scan messages with data during normal con-
nectivity and use that information to perform a partial
active scan (or no scan at all) during the handoff. Also
passive scanning (listening for beacon messages) might
be performed during normal connectivity to build up
the list of APs.
3. Since the probe-wait time depends on the number of
probe responses received, another strategy might be
to create an ordering among the APs such that a sin-
gle AP or a small set of APs is responsible for probe
requests (i.e. the number of probe responses is a con-
stant).
5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The primary contribution of this work is a detailed analysis
of the handoff process, the factors that bring about the high
latency and the variation and the various messages/steps in-
volved. We find that out of the three basic functions (probe,
authentication and reassociation), carried out by the STA,
the probe phase has the dominant latency regardless of the
AP-STA being used.
We also present a detailed analysis of the probe phase, and
account for the large variation to the probe-wait time which
essentially depends on the particular heuristic employed by
the wireless client NIC being used.
In our experiments we used wireless PC cards from three
vendors, namely Lucent Orinoco, Cisco Aironet, and ZoomAir
and the APs from Lucent and Cisco. This gives us enough
diversity in our experiments and we find that there is large
variation in the latency with the particular AP-STA hard-
ware being used. Also we find that the sequence of messages
exchanged during the handoff process can also differ with the
STA being used.
One of the more interesting results of our work is that cur-
rent WLAN equipment will not meet the expectations (re-
placing or augment 4G systems) that many have. This is
because the handoff latencies we measured far exceed guide-
lines for jitter in voice over IP (VoIP) applications where
the overall latency is recommended not to exceed 50ms [6].
In the future, we plan to investigate methods to add a robust
authentication mechanism to WLAN handoffs and reduce
the overall latency of the handoff within acceptable bounds
for VoIP applications.
