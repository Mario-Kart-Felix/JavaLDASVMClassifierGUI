Genome-wide association study of 14,000 cases of seven
common diseases and 3,000 shared controls
The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium*
Abstract
There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful
approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint
GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British
population, which has examined ~2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set
of ~3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at
P<5×10-7: 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn’s disease, 3 in rheumatoid
arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication
studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We
observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some
loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large
number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10-5 and 5×10-7)
likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was
confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a
thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared
control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease
phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common
diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European
ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally
modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important
disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other
investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.
Despite extensive research efforts for more than a decade, the genetic basis of common
human diseases remains largely unknown. Although there have been some notable
successes1, linkage and candidate gene association studies have often failed to deliver
definitive results. Yet the identification of the variants, genes and pathways involved in
particular diseases offers a potential route to new therapies, improved diagnosis and better
disease prevention. For some time it has been hoped that the advent of genome-wide
association (GWA) studies would provide a successful new tool for unlocking the genetic
basis of many of these common causes of human morbidity and mortality1.
Three recent advances mean that GWA studies that are powered to detect plausible effect
sizes are now possible2. First, the International HapMap resource3, which documents
patterns of genome-wide variation and linkage disequilibrium in four population samples,
greatly facilitates both the design and analysis of association studies. Second, the availability

of dense genotyping chips, containing sets of hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that provide good coverage of much of the human genome, means
that for the first time GWA studies for thousands of cases and controls are technically and
financially feasible. Third, appropriately large and well-characterized clinical samples have
been assembled for many common diseases.
The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) was formed with a view to
exploring the utility, design and analyses of GWA studies. It brought together over 50
research groups from the UK that are active in researching the genetics of common human
diseases, with expertise ranging from clinical, through genotyping, to informatics and
statistical analysis. Here we describe the main experiment of the consortium: GWA studies
of 2,000 cases and 3,000 shared controls for 7 complex human diseases of major public
health importance—bipolar disorder (BD), coronary artery disease (CAD), Crohn’s disease
(CD), hypertension (HT), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and type 2
diabetes (T2D). Two further experiments undertaken by the consortium will be reported
elsewhere: a GWA study for tuberculosis in 1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, sampled from
The Gambia; and an association study of 1,500 common controls with 1,000 cases for each
of breast cancer, multiple sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis and autoimmune thyroid disease,
all typed at around 15,000 mainly non-synonymous SNPs. By simultaneously studying
seven diseases with differing aetiologies, we hoped to develop insights, not only into the
specific genetic contributions to each of the diseases, but also into differences in allelic
architecture across the diseases. A further major aim was to address important
methodological issues of relevance to all GWA studies, such as quality control, design and
analysis. In addition to our main association results, we address several of these issues
below, including the choice of controls for genetic studies, the extent of population structure
within Great Britain, sample sizes necessary to detect genetic effects of varying sizes, and
improvements in genotype-calling algorithms and analytical methods.
Samples and experimental analyses
Individuals included in the study were living within England, Scotland and Wales (‘Great
Britain’) and the vast majority had self-identified themselves as white Europeans (153
individuals with non-Caucasian ancestry were excluded from final analysis—see below).
The seven conditions selected for study are all common familial diseases of major public
health importance both in the UK and globally4, and for which suitable nationally
representative sample sets were available. The control individuals came from two sources:
1,500 individuals from the 1958 British Birth Cohort (58C) and 1,500 individuals selected
from blood donors recruited as part of this project (UK Blood Services (UKBS) controls).
See Methods and Supplementary Table 1 for sample recruitment, phenotypes and summary
details for each collection.
We adopted an experimental design with 2,000 cases for each disease and 3,000 combined
controls. All 17,000 samples were genotyped with the GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set
(Affymetrix chip), which comprises 500,568 SNPs, as described in Methods. The power of
this study (estimated from simulations that mimic linkage disequilibrium patterns in the
HapMap Caucasian sample (CEU), see Methods) averaged across SNPs with minor allele
frequencies (MAFs) above 5% is estimated to be 43% for alleles with a relative risk of 1.3,
increasing to 80% for a relative risk of 1.5, for a P-value threshold of 5×10-7
(Supplementary Table 2).
We developed a new algorithm, CHIAMO, which we applied to simultaneously call the
genotypes from all individuals (see Methods and Supplementary Information). Cross-
platform comparison showed CHIAMO to outperform BRLMM (the standard Affymetrix

algorithm) by having an error rate under 0.2% (Supplementary Table 3), and comparison of
108 duplicate genotypes in our study gave a discordance rate of 0.12%.
We excluded 809 samples after checks for contamination, false identity, non-Caucasian
ancestry and relatedness (see Methods and Supplementary Table 4); 16,179 individuals
remained in the study.
Genome-wide, 469,557 SNPs (93.8%) passed our quality control filters (described in
Methods) giving an average call rate of 99.63%. Of those, 392,575 have study-wide MAFs >
1% (45,106 have MAFs < 0.1%; see also Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Initial analyses of
the polymorphic SNPs suggest that patterns of linkage disequilibrium in our samples are
very similar to those in HapMap (Supplementary Fig. 3). Therefore, we expect genome
coverage with the Affymetrix 500K set in this study to be similar to that estimated for the
HapMap CEU panel2.
All SNPs passing quality control filters were used in the association analyses, although
power is very low for SNPs with low MAFs (unless they have unusually large effects). On
visual inspection of the cluster plots of SNPs showing apparently strong association, we
removed a further 638 SNPs with poor clustering.
Control groups
Our main purpose in using two control groups was to assess possible bias in ascertaining
control samples. In addition, noting that DNA sample processing differed between these
groups, comparison of control groups also provides a check for effects of differential
genotyping errors as a result of differences in DNA collection and preparation. Figure 1a
shows the results of 1-d.f. Mantel-extension tests5 for differences in allele frequencies of
SNPs between subjects from the 58BC and UKBS collections, stratified by 12 broad regions
of Great Britain (see Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Fig. 4 for region
definitions). The associated quantile-quantile plot (see Methods for background) in Fig. 1b
shows good agreement with the null distribution (similar results are obtained for tests that do
not stratify by geography, data not shown). The fact that we see few significant differences
between these two control groups despite the fact that they differ in population groups
sampled, DNA processing, and age, indicates that there would be little bias due to use of
either sample as a control group for any of the case series, and justifies our combining of the
two control groups to form a single group of 3,000 subjects for our main analyses.
One consequence of using a shared control group (for which detailed phenotyping for all
traits of interest is not available) relates to the potential for misclassification bias: a
proportion of the controls is likely to have the disease of interest (and therefore might meet
the criteria for inclusion as a case) and some others will develop it in the future. However,
the effect this has on power is modest unless the extent of misclassification bias is
substantial; for example, if 5% of controls would meet the definition of cases at the same
age, the loss of power is approximately the same as that due to a reduction of the sample size
by 10%6. Even for the higher prevalence conditions examined by the WTCCC (such as HT,
CAD and T2D), the precise ascertainment schemes used here (which enriched for more
extreme phenotypes and/or strong family history) will have limited the proportions of
controls meeting case criteria to low levels (for example, to <5%). Although a study design
which used ‘hypercontrols’ (that is, selection of control individuals from the lower extremity
of the relevant trait distribution) would generally be the most powerful approach in a study
focusing on one disease, the merits of such an approach need to be weighed against the
additional costs associated with the need to phenotype and genotype each control sample.

Geographical variation and population structure
An additional cause of false positive findings is hidden population structure. Case and
control samples may differ in the distribution of their ancestry, either owing to control
sampling effects, as discussed above, or to confounding when different ancestries carry
higher disease risk and are, as a result, over-represented in cases. Even after exclusion of
individuals with evidence of recent non-European ancestry, the British population is
heterogeneous, having been shaped by several waves of immigration from southern and
northern Europe. Whether the differences between these incoming populations are
sufficiently large to distort the findings of population-based case-control studies is an open
question.
We first examined our samples for non-European ancestry, using multidimensional scaling
after ‘seeding’ our data with those from the three HapMap analysis panels (see
Supplementary Fig. 5 and Methods), and excluded 153 individuals on this basis. We next
looked for evidence of population heterogeneity by studying allele frequency differences
between the 12 broad geographical regions (defined in Supplementary Fig. 4). The results
for these 11-d.f. tests and associated quantile-quantile plots are shown in Fig. 2. Widespread
small differences in allele frequencies are evident as an increased slope of the line (Fig. 2b);
in addition, a few loci show much larger differences (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6).
Thirteen genomic regions showing strong geographical variation are listed in Table 1, and
Supplementary Fig. 7 shows the way in which their allele frequencies vary geographically.
The predominant pattern is variation along a NW/SE axis. The most likely cause for these
marked geographical differences is natural selection, most plausibly in populations ancestral
to those now in the UK. Variation due to selection has previously been implicated at LCT
(lactase) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)7-9, and within-UK differentiation at
4p14 has been found independently10, but others seem to be new findings. All but three of
the regions contain known genes. Aside from evolutionary interest, genes showing evidence
of natural selection are particularly interesting for the biology of traits such as infectious
diseases; possible targets for selection include NADSYN1 (NAD synthetase 1) at 11q13,
which could have a role in prevention of pellagra, as well as TLR1 (toll-like receptor 1) at
4p14, for which a role in the biology of tuberculosis and leprosy has been suggested10.
There may be important population structure that is not well captured by current
geographical region of residence. Present implementations of strongly model-based
approaches such as STRUCTURE11,12 are impracticable for data sets of this size, and we
reverted to the classical method of principal components13,14, using a subset of 197,175
SNPs chosen to reduce inter-locus linkage disequilibrium. Nevertheless, four of the first six
principal components clearly picked up effects attributable to local linkage disequilibrium
rather than genome-wide structure. The remaining two components show the same
predominant geographical trend from NW to SE but, perhaps unsurprisingly, London is set
somewhat apart (Supplementary Fig. 8).
The overall effect of population structure on our association results seems to be small, once
recent migrants from outside Europe are excluded. Estimates of over-dispersion of the
association trend test statistics (usually denoted λ; ref. 15) ranged from 1.03 and 1.05 for
RA and T1D, respectively, to 1.08-1.11 for the remaining diseases. Some of this over-
dispersion could be due to factors other than structure, and this possibility is supported by
the fact that inclusion of the two ancestry informative principal components as covariates in
the association tests reduced the over-dispersion estimates only slightly (Supplementary
Table 6), as did stratification by geographical region. This impression is confirmed on
noting that P values with and without correction for structure are similar (Supplementary

Fig. 9). We conclude that, for most of the genome, population structure has at most a small
confounding effect in our study, and as a consequence the analyses reported below do not
correct for structure. In principle, apparent associations in the few genomic regions
identified in Table 1 as showing strong geographical differentiation should be interpreted
with caution, but none arose in our analyses.
Disease association results
We assessed evidence for association in several ways (see Methods for details), drawing on
both classical and bayesian statistical approaches. For polymorphic SNPs on the Affymetrix
chip, we performed trend tests (1 degree of freedom16) and general genotype tests (2
degrees of freedom16, referred to as genotypic) between each case collection and the pooled
controls, and calculated analogous Bayes factors. There are examples from animal models
where genetic effects act differently in males and females17, and to assess this in our data
we applied a
Box 1
Significance levels in genome-wide studies
There has been much debate concerning interpretation of significance levels in genome-
wide association studies and whether, and how, these should be corrected for multiple
testing. Classical multiple testing theory in statistics is concerned with the problem of
‘multiple tests’ of a single ‘global’ null hypothesis. This, we would argue, is a problem
far removed from that which faces us in genome-wide association studies, where we face
the problem of testing ‘multiple hypotheses’ (for a particular disease, one hypothesis for
each SNP, or region of correlated SNPs, in the genome) and we thus do not subscribe to
the view that one should correct significance levels for the number of tests performed to
obtain ‘genome-wide significance levels’. Nonetheless, our aim is to keep the false
positive rate within acceptable bounds and this still leads to the view that very low P
values are needed for strong evidence of association. But the factor determining the
threshold is not the number of tests performed, but the a priori probability that there is
likely to be a true association at any specified location in the genome. Of course, we
cannot know this prior probability from objective evidence, but we can perhaps estimate
an order of magnitude.
There are two linked questions. The first concerns the choice of an appropriate
‘threshold’ for reporting possible associations as likely to be genuine. Here the
mathematics is quite straightforward if we make the simplifying assumption that we have
the same power to detect all true associations. Then we have18
That is, for a given significance threshold, the probability of a true association depends
on the prior odds and, crucially, the power. A plausible estimate for the prior odds of true
association at any specified locus might be of the order of 100,000:1 against, for
example, on the basis of 1,000,000 ‘independent’ regions of the genome and an
expectation of 10 detectable genes involved in the condition. (Other plausible estimates
might vary from this by an order of magnitude or so in either direction.) Then, assuming
a power of 0.5 and a significance threshold of 5×10-7, the posterior odds in favour of a
‘hit’ being a true association would be 10:1. However, if we relax this significance
threshold by a factor of ten, or alternatively if the power were lower by a factor of 10, the
posterior odds that a ‘hit’ is a true association would also be reduced by a factor of ten.

This simple mathematical analysis is little affected by allowing for the fact that true
associations come in various sizes with varying power to detect them; the above formula
is simply modified by interpreting ‘power’ as the mean power.
The above discussion concerns ‘average’ properties of ‘hits’ achieving given significance
levels. After the association data are available, a related but different question is whether
a particular positive finding is likely to be a true one. For that calculation, the prior odds
must be multiplied by the Bayes factor, the ratio of the probability of the observed data
under the assumption that there is a true association to its probability under the null
hypothesis. As in power calculations, the calculation of Bayes factors requires
assumptions about effect sizes (see Methods for details).
A key point from both perspectives is that interpreting the strength of evidence in an
association study depends on the likely number of true associations, and the power to
detect them which, in turn, depends on effect sizes and sample size. In a less-well-
powered study it would be necessary to adopt more stringent thresholds to control the
false-positive rate. Thus, when comparing two studies for a particular disease, with a hit
with the same MAF and P value for association, the likelihood that this is a true positive
will in general be greater for the study that is better powered, typically the larger study.
In practice, smaller studies often employ less stringent P-value thresholds, which is
precisely the opposite of what should occur.
sex-differentiated test which is sensitive to associations of a different magnitude and/or
direction in the two sexes.
Our study also allows us to look for loci which may have an effect in more than one disease.
To assess this, we compared our common controls with all cases in each of three natural
groupings of diseases: CAD+HT+T2D (metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes with
potential aetiological overlap, for example, involving defects in insulin action); RA+T1D
(already known to share common loci); and CD+RA+T1D (all autoimmune diseases).
To help to capture putative disease loci not on the Affymetrix chip we used a new
multilocus method in which a population genetics model is applied to our genotype data and
the HapMap reference samples to simulate, or impute, genotype data at 2,193,483 HapMap
SNPs not on the Affymetrix chip. These imputed, or in silico, genotypes are then tested for
association in the same ways as SNPs genotyped in the project.
Before detailing the principal results for each disease, we first summarize our main
observations. Table 2 details the findings from the WTCCC scan for the 15 variants for
which there was strong prior evidence of association with one or more of the diseases
studied, based on extensive replication studies. All but two of these show associations in our
study, with the magnitude of the evidence generally consistent with their effect sizes as
estimated from prior studies. One of the signals for which we failed to obtain evidence of
replication (APOE in CAD) is poorly tagged by the Affymetrix 500K chip. The other (INS
in T1D) is represented by a single SNP that marginally failed our study-wide quality control
filters (overall missingness 5.2%) but which was nonetheless strongly associated with T1D
when examined. Quantile-quantile plots for the trend test for each of the seven disease show
only very minor deviations from the null distribution, except in the extreme tails which
correspond to associations reported below (Fig. 3). The quantile-quantile plots and the
results at positive controls (Table 2) give confidence in the quality of our data and the
robustness of our analyses.
Our genome-wide results for the trend test are illustrated in Fig. 4. The single-disease trend
and genotypic tests for SNPs on the chip identified 21 signals across the 7 diseases that

exceeded a threshold of 5×10-7 (Table 3). For each of these SNPs (except those within the
MHC), cluster plots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 10 and ‘signal plots’ in Fig. 5. These
signal plots estimate the likely demarcation of the hit region and show the signal at
genotyped and imputed SNPs together with local genomic context. Four further strong (with
P<5×10-7) associations were revealed by the other primary analyses described (Table 3).
One locus (in RA) was revealed by the sex-differentiated analysis, two through multilocus
approaches (both for T1D) and one through an analysis which combined cases from more
than one autoimmune disease (signal plots in Supplementary Figs 11, 12 and 13,
respectively).
All of these signals were subjected to visual inspection of cluster plots, and in all cases (with
one exception noted below) nearby correlated SNPs also showed a strong signal (see signal
plots). Thus, genotyping artefacts are unlikely to be responsible for these associations.
Indeed, at the time of writing, 12 of these 25 strong signals represent replications of
previously reported findings (only those with extensive prior replication are reported in
Table 2). Of the remainder, follow-up studies (reported elsewhere) have confirmed all but
one of the loci (ten in total) for which replication has been attempted10,19-24. The other
replication study gave equivocal results. Of the 18 loci implicated in autoimmune disease, 5
show associations (P<0.001) to more than 1 condition, leading to a number of further
potential new associations, at least one of which has also been replicated10.
It is likely that further susceptibility genes will be identified through follow-up of other
signals for which the evidence from our scan is less conclusive (see below for some specific
examples). For example, there are 58 further signals with single-point P values between 10-5
and 5×10-7 for which inspection of cluster plots verifies CHIAMO calls (Table 4). As
described below, analyses which make use of selected case samples to expand the reference
group should also provide a useful route to the prioritization of such putative signals for
further analysis. For convenience, the strongest association results are presented separately
for each disease in Supplementary Table 7.
Several general points are relevant to interpretation of these disease-association data. First,
replication studies are required to confirm associations from GWAs. For the reasons given
in the box, we regard very low P values (say P<5×10-7) in our comparatively large sample
size as strong evidence for association, and indeed all or most of the loci we find at this level
are either already known or have now been confirmed by subsequent replication. Such
replication studies are also the substrate for efforts to determine the range of associated
phenotypes and to identify and characterize pathologically relevant variation.
Second, failure to detect a prominent association signal in the present study cannot provide
conclusive exclusion of any given gene. This is the consequence of several factors
including: less-than-complete coverage of common variation genome-wide on the
Affymetrix chip; poor coverage (by design) of rare variants, including many structural
variants (thereby reducing power to detect rare, penetrant, alleles)25; difficulties with
defining the full genomic extent of the gene of interest; and, despite the sample size,
relatively low power to detect, at levels of significance appropriate for genome-wide
analysis, variants with modest effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) < 1.2).
Third, whereas the association signals detected can help to define regions of interest, they
cannot provide unambiguous identification of the causal genes. Nevertheless, assessments
on the basis of positional candidacy carry considerable weight, and, as we show, these
already allow us, for selected diseases, to highlight pathways and mechanisms of particular
interest. Naturally, extensive resequencing and fine-mapping work, followed by functional

studies will be required before such inferences can be translated into robust statements about
the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved.
We turn now to a discussion of the main findings for each disease, focusing here only on the
most significant and interesting results from the analyses described above, and consideration
of an expanded reference group, described below.
Bipolar disorder (BD)
Bipolar disorder (BD; manic depressive illness26) refers to an episodic recurrent
pathological disturbance in mood (affect) ranging from extreme elation or mania to severe
depression and usually accompanied by disturbances in thinking and behaviour: psychotic
features (delusions and hallucinations) often occur. Pathogenesis is poorly understood but
there is robust evidence for a substantial genetic contribution to risk27,28. The estimated
sibling recurrence risk (λs) is 7-10 and heritability 80-90%27,28. The definition of BD
phenotype is based solely on clinical features because, as yet, psychiatry lacks validating
diagnostic tests such as those available for many physical illnesses. Indeed, a major goal of
molecular genetics approaches to psychiatric illness is an improvement in diagnostic
classification that will follow identification of the biological systems that underpin the
clinical syndromes. The phenotype definition that we have used includes individuals that
have suffered one or more episodes of pathologically elevated mood (see Methods), a
criterion that captures the clinical spectrum of bipolar mood variation that shows familial
aggregation29.
Several genomic regions have been implicated in linkage studies30 and, recently, replicated
evidence implicating specific genes has been reported. Increasing evidence suggests an
overlap in genetic susceptibility with schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder with many
similarities to BD. In particular association findings have been reported with both disorders
at DAOA (D-amino acid oxidase activator), DISC1 (disrupted in schizophrenia 1), NRG1
(neuregulin1) and DTNBP1 (dystrobrevin binding protein 1)31.
The strongest signal in BD was with rs420259 at chromosome 16p12 (genotype test
P=6.3×10-8; Table 3) and the best-fitting genetic model was recessive (Supplementary Table
8). Although recognizing that this signal was not additionally supported by the expanded
reference group analysis (see below and Supplementary Table 9) and that independent
replication is essential, we note that several genes at this locus could have pathological
relevance to BD, (Fig. 5). These include PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2), which is
involved in stability of key nuclear structures including chromatin and the nuclear matrix;
NDUFAB1 (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1, alpha/beta subcomplex, 1), which
encodes a subunit of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain; and DCTN5
(dynactin 5), which encodes a protein involved in intracellular transport that is known to
interact with the gene ‘disrupted in schizophrenia 1’ (DISCI)32, the latter having been
implicated in susceptibility to bipolar disorder as well as schizophrenia33.
Of the four regions showing association at P<5×10-7 in the expanded reference group
analysis (Supplementary Table 9), it is of interest that the closest gene to the signal at
rs1526805 (P=2.2×10-7) is KCNC2 which encodes the Shaw-related voltage-gated
potassium channel. Ion channelopathies are well-recognized as causes of episodic central
nervous system disease, including seizures, ataxias and paralyses34. It is possible that this
may extend to episodic disturbances of mood and behaviour.
Amongst the other higher ranked signals in the BD data set (Supplementary Table 7), there
is support for the previously suggested importance of GABA neurotransmission (rs7680321
(P=6.2×10-5) in GABRBI encoding a ligand-gated ion channel (GABA A receptor, beta

1))35, glutamate neurotransmission (rs1485171 (P=9.7×10-5) in GRM7 (glutamate receptor,
metabotropic 7))35 and synaptic function (rs11089599 (P=7.2 × 10-5) in SYN3 (synapsin
III)36).
We note that a broad range of genetic and non-genetic data point to the importance of
analyses that use alternative approaches to phenotype definition, including symptom
dimensions31. Although beyond the scope of the current paper, such analyses will be
required to maximize the potential of the current BD data set.
Coronary artery disease (CAD)
Coronary artery disease (coronary atherosclerosis) is a chronic degenerative condition in
which lipid and fibrous matrix is deposited in the walls of the coronary arteries to form
atheromatous plaques37. It may be clinically silent or present with angina pectoris or acute
myocardial infarction. Pathogenesis is complex, with endothelial dysfunction, oxidative
stress and inflammation contributing to development and instability of the atherosclerotic
plaque37.
In addition to lifestyle and environmental factors, genes are important in the aetiology of
CAD38. For early myocardial infarction, estimates of λs range from ~2 to ~7 (ref. 39).
Genetic variation is thought likely to influence risk of CAD both directly and through effects
on known CAD risk factors including hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia.
Genome-wide linkage studies have mapped several loci that may affect susceptibility to
CAD/myocardial infarction40 although for only two of these has the likely gene been
identified (ALOX5AP (arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein) and LTA4H
(leukotriene A4 hydrolase))41,42. Association studies have identified several plausible
genetic variants affecting lipids, thrombosis, inflammation or vascular biology but for most
the evidence is not yet conclusive40. We did not find evidence for strong association at any
of these genes within our study (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10).
The most notable new finding for CAD is the powerful association on chromosome 9p21.3
(Table 3; Fig. 5). Although the strongest signal is seen at rs1333049 (P=1.8×10-14),
associations are seen for SNPs across>100 kilobases. This region has not been highlighted in
previous studies of CAD or myocardial infarction40,43. The region of interest contains the
coding sequences of genes for two cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors, CDKN2A (encoding
p16INK4a) and CDKN2B (p15INK4b), although the most closely associated SNP is some
distance removed. Both genes have multiple isoforms, have an important role in the
regulation of the cell cycle and are widely expressed44, with CDKN2B known to be
expressed in the macrophages but not the smooth muscle cells of fibrofatty lesions45,46. It
is of interest that expression of CDKN2B is induced by transforming growth factor beta
(TGF-β) and that the TGF-β signalling system is implicated in the pathogenesis of human
atherosclerosis45,46. Besides CDKN2A and CDKN2B, the only other known gene nearby is
MTAP which encodes methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, an enzyme that contributes to
polyamine metabolism and is important for the salvage of both adenine and methionine.
MTAP is ubiquitously expressed, including in the cardiovascular system47. Further work is
required to determine whether the CAD association at this locus is mediated through
CDKN2A/B, MTAP or some other mechanism. The same region also shows replicated
evidence of association to T2D in the WTCCC and other data sets19,21,22, though different
SNPs seem to be involved.
None of the loci showing more modest associations with CAD (Table 4) includes genes
hitherto strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD. A potentially interesting
association is at rs6922269 (P=6.3×10-6), an intronic SNP in MTHFD1L, which encodes
methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+-dependent) 1-like, the mitochondrial

isozyme of C1-tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase48,49. C1-THF synthases interconvert the
one carbon units carried by the biologically active form of folic acid, C1-tetrahydrofolate.
These are used in a variety of cellular processes including purine and methionine
synthesis48. Another enzyme in the same pathway, methylene THF reductase (encoded by
MTHFR) is subject to a common mutation which influences plasma homocysteine level50
and has been associated with increased risk of coronary and other atherosclerotic disease51.
The possibility of a link between variants in MTHFD1L and CAD risk is supported by
evidence that MTHFD1L activity also contributes to plasma homocysteine52 and that
defects in the MTHFD1L pathway may increase plasma homocysteine level48,53.
An intronic SNP in ADAMTS17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
motifs 17), which showed modest association (rs1994016; P=1.1×10-4) in our primary
analysis, showed a much stronger association in the expanded reference group analysis (see
below and Supplementary Table 9). Although the specific function of ADAMTS17 has not
been determined, other members of the ADAMTS family have been implicated in vascular
extracellular matrix degradation, vascular remodelling and atherosclerosis54,55.
Crohn’s disease (CD)
Crohn’s disease is a common form of chronic inflammatory bowel disease56. The
pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood, but probably involve a dysregulated immune
response to commensal intestinal bacteria and possibly defects in mucosal barrier function
or bacterial clearance57. Genetic predisposition to CD is suggested by a λs of 17-35 and by
twin studies that contrast monozygotic concordance rates of 50% with only 10% in dizygotic
pairs58,59.
A number of CD-susceptibility loci have previously been defined, and all of these generate
strong signals in our data (Table 2). In 2001, positional cloning identified CARD15 (caspase
recruitment domain family, member 15; NOD2) as the first confirmed CD-susceptibility
gene60,61. In the present study, this locus is represented by rs17221417 (P=9.4×10-12). A
second association, on chromosome 5q31 (ref. 62) has been widely replicated, although the
identity of the causative gene is disputed owing to extensive regional linkage
disequilibrium63. Here, the previously described risk haplotype is tagged by rs6596075
(P=5.4×10-7).
More recent studies have identified four further CD-susceptibility loci, all of which are
strongly replicated in the present study. The association between CD and SNPs within
IL23R (interleukin 23 receptor)63 is here represented by a cluster of associated SNPs,
including rs11805303 (P=6.5×10-13). The strongest signal for CD in the present scan (at
rs10210302; P=7.1×10-14) maps to the ATG16L1 (ATG16 autophagy related 16-like 1) gene
and is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2=0.97) with a non-synonymous SNP (T300A,
rs2241880) associated with CD in a German non-synonymous SNP scan64. The third is a
locus at chromosome 10q21 around rs10761659 (P=2.7×10-7) and represents a non-coding
intergenic SnP mapping 14-kb telomeric to gene ZNF365 and 55-kb centromeric to the
pseudogene antiquitin-like 4—a recently detected signal65. Finally, strong association with
a cluster of SNPs around rs17234657 (P=2.1×10-13) within a 1.2 Mb gene desert on
chromosome 5p13.1, recapitulates the finding of a recent GWA study66.
The current study identifies four further new strong association signals in CD, located on
chromosomes 3p21, 5p33, 10p24 and 18p11 (Table 3; Fig. 5). Successful replication for all
four loci is reported elsewhere23.
The first of these includes several SNPs around IRGM (immunity-related guanosine
triphosphatase; the human homologue of the mouse Irgm/Lrg47), the strongest singal being

at rs1000113 (P=5.1×10-8). IRGM encodes a GTP-binding protein which induces autophagy
and is involved in elimination of intracellular bacteria, including Mycobacterium
tuberculosis67. Reduced function and/or activity of this gene would be expected to lead to
presistence of intracellular bacteria, consistent with existing models of CD pathogenesis57
and the recent ATG16L1 association64 (see above).
The second novel CD association is seen at rs9858542 (P=7.7×10-7), a synonymous coding
SNP within the BSN (bassoon) gene on chromosome 3p21. BSN is thought to encode a
scaffold protein expressed in brain and involved in neurotransmitter release; a more
plausible regional candidate is MST1 (macrophage stimulating 1), which encodes a protein
influencing motile activity and phagocytosis by resident peritoneal macrophages68.
The third novel association involves a cluster of SNPs around rs10883365 (P=1.4×10-8) on
chromosome 10q24.2. The most credible candidate here is the NKX2-3 (NK2 transcription
factor related, locus 3) gene, a member of the NKX family of homeodomain-containing
transcription factors. Targeted disruption of the murine homologue of NKX2-3 results in
defective development of the intestine and secondary lymphoid organs69. Abnormal
expression of NKX2-3 may alter gut migration of antigen-responsive lymphocytes and
influence the intestinal inflammatory response.
The final novel association, at rs2542151 (P=4.6×10-8) maps 5.5-kb upstream of PTPN2
(protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2) on chromosome 18p11. PTPN2 encodes
the T cell protein tyrosine phosphatase TCPTP, a key negative regulator of inflammatory
responses. The same locus also shows strong association with T1D susceptibility (trend test
P=1.9×10-6) and a consistent, though weaker, association with RA (P=1.9×10-2), supporting
the existence of overlapping pathways in the pathogenesis of very distinct inflammatory
phenotypes (combined trend test P value for all three diseases = 9×10-8) (Table 3; ref. 10).
Several further loci generating less strong evidence for association are of interest on the
basis of their biological candidacy (Table 4). For example, rs9469220 (P=8.7×10-7) mapping
to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system class II region was detected in the ‘second
tier’ of associations (Table 4). This suggests a significant contribution of HLA to CD-
susceptibility, though less marked than seen in classical autoimmune conditions such as
RAand T1D. Another interesting candidate flagged in Table 4 is TNFAIP3 (TNFα induced
protein 3), the closest gene to rs7753394 on chromosome 6q23. The protein product inhibits
TNFα-induced NFκB-dependent gene expression by interfering with RIP- or TRAF-2-
mediated transactivation signals—hence interacting with the same pathway as CARD15
(NOD2). Markers with lower levels of significance include rs6478108 (P=9.0×10-5) within
TNFSF15 (tumour necrosis factor super family, member 15), previously reported associated
with CD70; and rs3816769 (P=3.1×10-5) which maps within STAT3 (signal transducers and
activator of transcription, member 3). On the X chromosome rs2807261 (P=1.3×10-7) maps
50-kb from the gene CD40LG (CD40 ligand—previously known as TNF superfamily,
member 5), implicated in the regulation of B-cell proliferation, adhesion and
immunoglobulin class switching71. As described in the section on T1D, a modest
association between CD and SNPs in the vicinity of the PTPN11 gene on chromosome
12q24 (P=1.5×10-3) probably reflects a locus influencing general autoimmune
predisposition.
An emerging theme from molecular genetic studies of CD is the importance of defects in
authophagy and the processing of phagocytosed bacteria. A number of other specific
components within innate and adaptive immune pathways are also highlighted.

Hypertension (HT)
Hypertension refers to a clinically significant increase in blood pressure and constitutes an
important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (http://www.who.int/whr/2002/en/; ref. 72).
Lifestyle exposures that elevate blood pressure, including sodium intake, alcohol and excess
weight73 are well-described risk factors. Genetic factors are also important74,75. Estimates
of λs are approximately 2.5-3.5.
Experimental models have highlighted a number of quantitative trait loci but these have yet
to translate into insights into human hypertension76. Linkage studies are consistent with
susceptibility genes of modest effect size77 and well-replicated findings have yet to emerge
from association approaches.
None of the variants previously associated with HT showed evidence for association in our
study although we note that some, such as promoter of the WNK1 (WNK lysine deficient
protein kinase 1) gene78,79, are not well tagged by the Affymetrix chip.
For HT there were no SNPs with significance below 5×10-7 (Table 3) but the number and
distribution of association signals in the range 10-4 to 10-7 was similar to that of the other
diseases studied (Table 4 and Supplementary Table 7). There are several possible
explanations. First, HT may have fewer common risk alleles of larger effect sizes than some
of the other complex phenotypes. If so, then identification of susceptibility variants for HT
is likely be reliant on the synthesis of findings from multiple large-scale studies. Second, the
present study may have failed to detect genuine common susceptibility variants of large
effect size they happened to be poorly tagged by the set of SNPs genotyped in the current
study. If so, further rounds of genotyping using resources that offer increased density (or
complementary SNP sets), and/or improved analytical methods (for example, imputation-
based) should facilitate their discovery. Third, study of HT may be more susceptible than
other phenotypes to the diluting effects of misclassification bias due to the presence of
hypertensive individuals within the control samples. If so, power can be improved in future
studies by use of controls specifically screened to exclude individuals with elevated blood
pressure.
The most strongly associated SNPs (Table 4) do not identify genes from physiological
systems previously implicated by clinical or genetic studies in hypertension. The strongest
signal overall is with rs2820037 on 1q43 (genotypic test, P=7.7×10-7). The closest genes are
RYR2 (encoding the ryanodine receptor 2), mutations in which are associated with stress-
induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia80,81; CHRM3, encoding the cholinergic receptor muscarinic 3, a member of the
G protein-coupled receptor family32; and ZP4, the product of which is zona pellucida
glycoprotein 481. The strong association signals on the X chromosome using an expanded
reference group (see below and Supplementary Table 9) are of substantial interest but they
do not identify known genes of obvious relevance to HT.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the
synovial joints resulting in severe disability, particularly in patients who remain refractory to
available therapies82. Susceptibility to, and severity of, RA are determined by both genetic
and environmental factors, with λs estimates ranging from 5-10 (ref. 83).
An association between RA and alleles of the HLA-DRB1 locus has long been
established84. Despite extensive linkage85-87 and association studies, only one other RA
susceptibility locus has been convincingly identified in Caucasians. In common with several
autoimmune diseases including T1D, carriage of the T allele of the rs2476601 SNP in the

PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22) gene has been reproducibly
associated with RA, conferring a genetic relative risk of approximately 1.8 (refs 88, 89).
These known associations with HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22 explain around 50% of the
familial aggregation of RA.
Both these previous associations emerge strongly here (Table 2). The most associated
marker within PTPN22 (rs6679677: chromosome 1p13) is perfectly correlated (HapMap
CEU data r2=1) with the functionally relevant SNP (rs2476601) described previously, and
the effect size is consistent with previous estimates89. Amongst other putative RA
susceptibility genes, two SNPs mapping to CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated 4)
rs3087243 and rs11571300 were only nominally significant (P=0.085 and P=0.034,
respectively) (Supplementary Table 10.)
RA was the sole disease for which the sex-differentiated analysis generated a strong signal
due to different genetic effects in males and females. The SNP rs11761231 (chromosome 7)
generates a P value of 3.9×10-7 for the 2-degrees of freedom (d.f.) sex-differentiated test
which combines trend tests in males and females (Table 3). (The trend test ignoring the sex
of the individuals has a P value of 1.7×10-6.) This genotype has no effect on disease status in
males, but a strong apparently additive effect in females (P value in a logistic regression
model with additive log-odds is 0.68 in males and 6.8×10-8 in females, additive OR for
females 1.32), and may represent one of the first sex-differentiated effects in human
diseases. Cluster plots for this SNP seem good, but it is surrounded by recombination
hotspots and has no other SNPs on the Affymetrix chip with r2>0.1 (Supplementary Fig.
11). Some caution is therefore required, but this represents a potentially interesting finding
which warrants further investigation, particularly given the sex-related prevalence difference
characteristic of this condition.
None of the 9 SNPs with nominal P values in the range 10-5 to 5×10-7 (Table 4) map to loci
previously associated with RA. Of particular interest is the association of SNPs mapping
close to both the alpha and beta chains of the IL2 receptor (rs2104286 in the case of IL2RA;
rs743777 and IL2RB). The IL2 receptor mediates IL2 stimulation of T lymphocytes and is
thereby thought to have an important role in preventing autoimmunity. A rare 4-base-pair
deletion of IL2RA has been associated with development of severe autoimmune disease90,
and there is evidence (from previous data91, and from this study and its follow-up) that
SNPs within the IL2RA gene region are associated with T1D (see also T1D section).
Several of the SNPs with nominal significance in the range 10-4 to 10-5 (Supplementary
Table 7) map to genes with plausible biological relevance. Examples include SNPs within
genes implicated in the TNF pathway (for example, rs2771369 in TNFAIP2 (tumour
necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 2)) or in the regulation of T-cell function (rs854350 in
GZMB (granzyme B) and rs4750316 in PRKCQ (protein kinase C, theta)). The association
with rs10786617 in KAZALD1 (Kazal-type serine protease inhibitor domain-containing
protein 1 precursor), a gene whose product is known to have a role in bone regeneration
after injury, may be relevant to the development of bone erosions in RA.
RA and T1D were already known to have two disease susceptibility genes in common: at the
MHC, and PTPN22. As detailed elsewhere, our study provides data indicating that this list
can be extended to include variants around IL2RA (chromosome 10p15), PTPN2
(chromosome 18p11) and the chromosome 12q24 region (Supplementary Table 11), all
apparently novel in RA.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D)
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune disorder with onset usually in childhood92. The λs
for T1D is ~15 and twin data suggest that over 85% of the phenotypic variance is due to
genetic factors93. There are six genes/regions for which there is strong pre-existing
statistical support for a role in T1D-susceptibility: these are the major histocompatibility
complex (MHC), the genes encoding insulin, CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated
4) and PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22), and the regions around
the interleukin 2 receptor alpha (IL2RA/CD25) and interferon-induced helicase 1 genes
(IFIH1/MDA5)94. However, these signals can explain only part of the familial aggregation
of T1D. Five of these previously identified associations were detected in this scan (P≥0.001)
(Table 2 and Supplementary Table 10), the exception being the INS gene discussed above.
In this study, single-point analyses revealed three novel regions (on chromosomes 12q13,
12q24 and 16p13) showing strong evidence of association (P<5×10-7; Table 3). Four further
regions attained similar levels of significance either through multilocus analyses
(chromosomes 4q27 and 12p13: Table 3, Supplementary Fig. 12), or through the combined
analysis of autoimmune cases (chromosomes 18q11 and the 10p15 CD25 region: Table 3,
Supplementary Fig. 13). The associations with T1D for chromosomes 12q13, 12q24, 16p13
and 18p11 have been confirmed in independent and multiple populations10.
The two signals on chromosome 12 (at 12q13 and 12q24) map to regions of extensive
linkage disequilibrium covering more than ten genes (Fig. 5). Several of these represent
functional candidates because of their presumed roles in immune signalling, considered to
be a major feature of T1D-susceptibility. These include ERBB3 (receptor tyrosine-protein
kinase erbB-3 precursor) at 12q13 and SH2B3/LNK (SH2B adaptor protein 3), TRAFD1
(TRAF-type zinc finger domain containing 1) and PTPN11 (protein tyrosine phosphatase,
non-receptor type 11) at 12q24. For these signal regions in particular, extensive
resequencing, further genotyping and targeted functional studies will be essential steps in
identifying which gene, or genes, are causal95. Of those listed, PTPN11 is a particularly
attractive candidate given a major role in insulin and immune signalling96. It is also a
member of the same family of regulatory phosphatases as PTPN22, already established as an
important susceptibility gene for T1D and other autoimmune diseases94,97. Indeed, the
12q24 variant most associated with T1D also features in both the CD and RA scans,
generating a combined signal for all autoimmune cases of 9.3×10-10 (Supplementary Table
11).
In contrast, available annotations suggest that the 16p13 region contains only two genes of
unknown function, KIAA0350 and dexamethasone-induced transcript (Fig. 5). Also, the
region of association identified on 18p11 (Supplementary Fig. 14), which seems to confer
susceptibility to all three autoimmune conditions studied (combined trend test P=9×10-8,
P=4.6×10-8 for CD, 1.9×10-2 for RA, and 1.9×10-6 for T1D: Supplementary Table 11), maps
to a single gene, PTPN2 (protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2), a member of
the same family as PTPN22 and PTPN11 and involved in immune regulation96.
Our scan found associations with SNPs within the chromosome 10p15 region containing
CD25, encoding the high-affinity receptor for IL-2. This is consistent with a previous report
of associations of this region with T1D91. The CD25 region has previously been shown to
be associated with Graves’ disease98 and the present study also provides evidence of
association with RA (combined trend test P=5×10-8, P=~7×10-6 for RA and T1D separately,
Supplementary Table 11). This finding has clear biological connections to the evidence of
association between T1D and a region of 4q27 revealed by the multilocus analysis
(Supplementary Table 12, Supplementary Fig. 12). This region contains the genes encoding
both IL-2 and IL-21. Together with studies in the NOD (nonobese diabetic) mouse model of

T1D, which have shown that a major non-MHS locus (Idd3) reflects regulatory variation of
the Il2 gene99, our results point to the primary importance of the IL-2 pathway in T1D and
other autoimmune diseases.
One further region deserves comment. In the multilocus analysis, there was increased
support for a region on chromosome 12p13 containing several candidate genes, including
CD69 (CD69 antigen (p60, early T-cell activation antigen)) and multiple CLEC (C-type
lectin domain family) genes. In contrast to the chromosome 4 region where the effect of
impuation is to tip an already-strong signal (5.01×10-7 for typed rs17388568, trend test) over
the arbitrary threshold of 5×10-7, the 12p13 locus involves a more marked change between
imputed and actual (7.2×10-7 for rs11052552, general test). Replication studies of this
imputed SNP to date have produced equivocal results (for details see ref. 10).
Type 2 diabetes (T2D)
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder typically first diagnosed in the middle to late
adult years100. Strongly associated with obesity, the condition features defects in both the
secretion and peripheral actions of insulin101. The appareciable familial aggregation of T2D
(an estimated λs of ~3.0 in European individuals)73 reflects both shared family environment
and genetic predisposition. Heritability values vary widely with most estimates between 30
and 70%101.
To date, robust, widely replicated associations in non-isolate populations are limited to
variants in three genes: PPARG (encoding the peroxisomal proliferative activated receptor
gamma; P12A102), KCNJ11 (the inwardly-rectifying Kir6.2 component of the pancreatic
beta-cell KATP channel; E23K103) and TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2; rs7903146
(refs 104, 105)).
All three of these signals are detected here with effect-sizes consistent with previous reports
(Table 2). A cluster of SNPs on chromosome 10q, within TCFL2, represented by rs4506565
(trend test, OR 1.36, P=5.7×10-13) generates the strongest association signal for T2D (Table
3, Fig. 5). Rs4506565 is in tight linkage disequilibrium (r2 of 0.92 in the CEU component of
HapMap) with rs7903146, the variant with the strongest aetiological claims104,106. In fact,
our imputation analysis confirms that rs7903146, though unrepresented on the chip, is
responsible for the strongest association effect in this region (Fig. 5). TCF7L2 acts within
the WNT-signalling pathway, and effects on diabetes risk seem to be mediated
predominantly through beta-cell dysfunction107.
As expected, given existing effect-size estimates, the signals associated with variants within
the other established T2D-susceptibility genes, KCNJ11 (rs5215, r2 of 0.9 with rs5219,
E23K) and PPARG (rs17036328, r2 of 1 with rs1801282, P12A) are less dramatic (trend
test, OR 1.15 and 1.23 respectively, both P=~0.001). These examples illustrate how genuine
disease-susceptibility variants can generate association signals which would not attract
immediate attention for follow-up in the genomewide context.
Apart from TCF7L2, the scan reveals two signals for T2D with P values less than 5×10-7
(Table 3, Fig. 5). The first of these maps within the FTO (fat-mass and obesity-associated)
gene on chromosome 16q. Several adjacent SNPs (including rs9939609, rs7193144 and
rs8050136) generate signals characterized by a perallele OR for T2D of ~1.25 and a risk-
allele frequency of ~40% in controls. As recently described in follow-up studies prompted
by this finding, the effect of these variants on T2D-risk has been replicated and is mediated
entirely by their marked effect on adiposity24.

The third association signal (chromosome 6p22) features a cluster of highly associated SNPs
(including rs9465871) with risk-allele frequencies between 18 and 35%, mapping to intron 5
of the CDKAL1 (CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1-like 1) gene. Although the
function of CDKAL1 is not known, it shares homology at the protein domain level with
CDK5 regulatory subunit associated protein 1 (CDK5RAP1). CDK5RAP1 is known to
inhibit the activation of CDK5, a cyclin-dependent kinase which has been implicated in the
maintenance of normal beta-cell function108. Our own follow-up studies, and scans by other
groups have shown strong replication of this finding19-22. The effect of this variant on
T2D-risk shows significant departures from additivity (Supplemantary Table 8).
One notable inclusion amongst the variants with more modest association signals is a cluster
of SNPs on chromosome 10 including rs10748582 and rs7923866, which generate trend test
P values between 10-4 and 10-5. This cluster maps in the vicinity of the HHEX (homeobox,
hematopoietically expressed) and IDE (insulin-degrading enzyme) genes, in a region
recently highlighted in a GWA scan for T2D performed in 1363 subjects of French
origin109. The SNPs showing association in our data are proxies for those reported in the
French study and generate similar effect-size estimates for T2D.
Of the three other regions highlighted by the French scan109, none can be confirmed by our
data. The SNP in SLC30A8 associated with T2D in the French report (rs13266634) is poorly
correlated with SNPs on the Affymetrix chip (r2<0.01), and extensive recombination events
in the region limit the value of data-imputation methods. Coverage of the LOC387761 and
EXT2 signals is considerably better, but, for these, neither genotyped nor imputed SNPs
show evidence fo association with T2D.
WTCCC data contributed to identification of two additional robustly replicating T2D
signals, mapping to the 1GF2BP2 gene and CDKN2A/CDKN2B regions19,21,22, although
neither generated impressive P values on the primary scan analysis (neither single-point P
was <10-4). The latter signal maps to the same region as the CAD signal on chromosome 9
though different SNPs are involved. The other SNPs in Table 4 do not map to genes or
regions previously implicated in T2D pathogenesis, and replication efforts to date have not
identified any confirmed signals19.
Expanded reference group analyses
For a fixed number of cases, power of a case-control study can be increased by enlarging the
reference group. Our main analyses used a control:case ratio of 1.5:1 for each disease. The
availability of the other 6 disease data sets gave us the opportunity to expand the reference
group up to a ratio of ~7.5:1, with potential reciprocal benefits for the analysis of each
disease. For BD and T2D the expanded reference group comprised the 58C and UKBS
controls supplemented by the other 6 disease sets; for CAD and HT this expanded reference
group was reduced to exclude HT and CAD respectively; for CD, RA and T1D, the
reference group was augmented only by the cases from the non-autoimmune diseases.
The utility of the expanded reference group approach was demonstrated by increased
evidence for association at most of the loci that received strongest support from our primary
analysis, including many of the signals at loci known to show robust association in T1D,
T2D and CD (Supplementary Table 9). Additionally, this analysis elevated several loci with
modest levels of statistical significance in the primary analysis, to the top tier of statistical
significance (P<5×10-7).
Our data indicate that this approach may be a useful adjunct to conventional analysis and
that loci identified as highly significant should be considered for follow up. There are two
important caveats. First, susceptibility genes that influence both the test disease and one or

more of the diseases included in the reference group will cause loss of power. Second, a
‘mirror-image’ effect could occur whereby a strong association within the expanded
reference sample (for example, HLA in autoimmune diseases) causes spurious association
with the opposite allele in the test disease. Thus, a positive association using an expanded
reference group must be interpreted within the context of association findings in the diseases
included within the reference group.
Disease models
It is of interest to consider which statistical models best describe the data at and between loci
that are strongly associated with disease status. Biological interpretation of these statistical
models is not straightforward but they can help in choosing more powerful statistical tools
for detecting associations.
First, consider separately each of the 19 non-MHC SNPs showing strong evidence for
association on either the trend or genotypic test in Table 3. For four of these 19, the P value
on the 2-d.f. genotypic test was smaller than that on the 1-d.f. trend test (Table 3). When
comparing disease models, these were also the four SNPs with evidence for departure from a
simple model in which odds of disease increase multiplicatively with the number of copies
of the risk allele (Supplementary Table 8). This supports our view that the genotypic test
should be carried out in addition to the trend test, although should perhaps be viewed more
cautiously for two reasons: it is more susceptible to genotyping errors; and (on the basis of
our findings) experience does not favour strong dominance effects.
A separate question relates to the best models for the way in which different loci combine to
affect susceptibility to a disease, and as a consequence on the extent to which methods
explicitly allowing interactions between loci should be employed to detect associations110.
None of the analyses reported here includes such interactions, so we are not well placed to
address the general question. Nonetheless, within each collection with multiple associated
regions (CD, T1D and T2D) we considered all pairs of non-MHC SNPs in Table 3 and
looked for a departure from the model in which the two loci combine to increase log-odds in
an additive fashion. We found suggestive evidence of a departure from multilocus additivity
between rs1000113 and rs10761659 in CD (unadjusted P value = 0.002) and between
rs9465871 and rs4506565 in T2D (unadjusted P value = 0.004). Further investigation of this
question, preferably on unbiased sets of disease loci found through the application of single
locus and interaction-based approaches, would seem warranted.
Discussion
We have studied seven common familial diseases by genome-wide association analysis in
16,179 individuals. Our findings inform understanding of the genetic basis of the diseases
concerned and provide methodological insights relevant to the pursuit of GWA studies in
general.
A simple but important observation is that GWA analysis provides a highly effective
approach for exploring the genetic underpinnings of common familial diseases. Our yield of
novel, highly significant association findings is comparable to, or exceeds, the number of
those hitherto-generated by candidate gene or positional cloning efforts. For many of the
compelling signals, replication has already been obtained, including regions on
chromosomes 3p21, 5q33, 10q24 and 18p11 for CD23, 12q13, 12q24, 16p13 and 18p11 in
T1D10 and 6p22 and 16q12 in T2D19-22,24. For others, replication is required to establish
a definitive relationship with disease. Additional findings of particular interest include the
identification of several loci that seem to influence susceptibility to multiple autoimmune
diseases, and the suggestion of a novel locus for RA which shows sex-specific effects.

Our study enables us to make several general recommendations relevant to GWA studies.
The first relates to the importance of careful quality control. In such large data sets, small
systematic differences can readily produce effects capable of obscuring the true associations
being sought111,112. We implemented extensive quality control checks to minimize
differences in sample DNA concentration, quality and handling procedures and combined a
new genotype-calling algorithm (CHIAMO) with a set of filtering heuristics to select SNPs
for further analysis. Given that infallible detection of incorrect genotype calls is not yet
possible, the criteria used for SNP exclusion need to strike a compromise between
stringency (which may discard true signals or generate spurious positives through
differential missingness) and leniency (with the danger that true signals are swamped by
spurious findings due to poor genotype calling). As such, systematic visual inspection of
cluster plots for SNPs of interest remains an integral part of the quality control process.
The potential for population structure to undermine inferences in case-control association
studies has long been debated113 but limited empirical data have been available to assess
the issue. Our study highlighted several loci, some known and some new, which
demonstrate substantial geographical variation in allele frequencies across Britain (Table 1),
most probably due to natural selection in ancestral populations. Outside these loci, the
effects of population structure are relatively minor, and do not represent a major source of
confounding, provided that individuals with appreciable non-European ancestry are
excluded. Although these conclusions may not generalize to studies in other locations, this
finding reinforces the logistical and economic benefits of the case-control design over
alternatives (such as family-based association studies).
Our study allowed us to address another important methodological issue: the adequacy, or
otherwise, of using a common set of controls, rather than a sample recruited explicitly for
use with a defined disease sample. It is often assumed that failure to match cases and
controls for socio-demographic variables will lead to substantial inflation of the type I error
rate. Our study demonstrates that, within the context of large-scale genetic association
studies, for British populations at least, this concern has been overstated. A related argument
against use of population controls relates to the perceived impact of misclassification bias
when a proportion of controls meet the criteria used to define cases. However, the
consequent loss of power is modest unless the trait of interest is very common6. Given the
above, the present study provides a compelling case for both the suitability and efficiency of
the common control design in Britain and warrants its serious consideration elsewhere.
Further benefits can be expected from use of this common control genotype data set in
future GWA studies in Britain. Finally, in failing to detect significant differences in
performance between the epidemiological sample (58C) and that derived from blood donors
(UKBS), we validate the use of the latter samples for cost-effective, large-scale control
DNA provision.
In terms of general biological insights, the most profound relate to inferences about the
allelic architecture of common traits. The novel variants we have uncovered are
characterized by modest effect size (that is, per-allele ORs between 1.2 and 1.5) and even
these estimates are likely to be inflated114. We identified no additional common variants of
very large effect (akin to HLA in T1D: Supplementary Fig. 15). The observed distribution of
effect sizes is consistent with models based on theoretical considerations and empirical data
from animal models87,115,116 that suggest that, for any given trait, there will be few (if
any) large effects, a handful of modest effects and a substantial number of genes generating
small or very small increases in disease risk.
There are several important corollaries. Notwithstanding the incomplete coverage afforded
by the genotyping reagents employed, most of the susceptibility effects yet to be uncovered

for these diseases (at least those attributable to, or tagged by, common SNPs) are likely to
have effects of similar or smaller magnitude to those we have highlighted. Beyond the
signals with the strongest evidence for association, most of which are likely to be real (and
many of which have already been confirmed), there will be many additional susceptibility
variants for which the WTCCC provides some evidence, but for which extensive replication
will be required to establish validity. PPARG and KCNJ11 provide examples of proven
susceptibility genes (for T2D) that generated only modest evidence for association within
the WTCCC, and which would only have been revealed by such replication efforts. Given
the likely preponderance of susceptibility variants of small effect, the potential for
identifying further loci is limited only by the clinical resources available for replication
(assuming suitable study design, accurate genotyping and appropriate analysis and
inference). Provided the attribution of a causal relationship with the trait of interest is robust,
even variants of very small effect can offer fundamental biological insights.
The patterns of allelic architecture uncovered mean that replication efforts will need to
feature comparably large sample sizes: even if one accepts more relaxed significance
thresholds given the prior evidence, one has to consider the inflation in effect-size estimates
in the primary study. Caution is required in reaching negative conclusions on the basis of a
single failed attempt at replication, or any set of replication attempts that are inadequately
powered.
One of our major design considerations was sample size. We set out to include samples
larger than those previously examined for genome-wide association, and our results suggest
that such large sample sizes were necessary. Even with 2,000 cases and 3,000 controls,
adequate power is restricted to common variants of relatively large effect (see
Supplementary Table 2). We carried out an experiment to see which SNPs showing strong
evidence of association in the full data (that is, signals outside MHC with trend test
P<5×10-7), would have been detected at that same threshold in only a subset of our data
(Fig. 6). Because it focuses on a particular but arbitrary P-value threshold, some care is
needed in interpreting the figure. Nonetheless, for subsamples of 1,000 cases and 1,000
controls, of the 16 loci detected in the full study, we would have been certain of seeing only
2, with an expectation of about 6; for subsamples of 1,500 cases and 1,500 controls, we
could expect to have seen about 9. These figures provide stark evidence that the larger the
study sample, the more loci can be expected to reach threshold significance values. Indeed,
given the likely distribution of effect sizes for most complex traits (see above), there are
strong grounds for the prosecution of GWA studies on an even larger scale than ours, and,
wherever possible, combining the results from existing GWA scans performed for the same
trait. To assist such efforts, individual level data from this study will be widely available
through the Consortium’s Data Access Committee (follow links from http://
www.wtccc.org.uk).
In our study, T1D and CD, the conditions showing strongest familial aggregation (as
quantified by their sibling relative risks, λs), generated the largest number of highly
significant associations. This relationship was not sustained in comparisons between the
other five diseases. It is important to recognize that the association signals so far identified
account for only a small proportion of overall familiality. There is a disparity in scale
between the modest locus-specific λs effects attributable to the identified associations (for
instance, the prominent TCF7L2 signal for T2D translates into a λs of only 1.03) and the
estimates of overall familiality that reflects the combined effects of all genes and shared
family environment. These estimates demonstrate the limited potential of the variants thus
far identified (singly or in combination) to provide clinically useful prediction of
disease117,118

The identification and characterization of the aetiological variants that underlie replicated
associations will necessitate extensive fine-mapping and functional validation. We view the
WTCCC study and data set as an important first step towards harnessing the powerful
molecular genomic tools now available to dissect the biological basis of common disease
and translating those findings into improvements in human health.
METHODS SUMMARY
A detailed description of materials and methods is given in Methods. The work-flow and
organization of the project are given in Supplementary Fig. 16. Case series came from
previously established collections with nationally representative recruitment: 2,000 samples
were genotyped for each. The control samples came from two sources: half from the 1958
Birth Cohort and the remainder from a new UK Blood Service sample. The latter collection
was established specifically for this study and is a UK national repository of anonymized
DNA samples from 3,622 consenting blood donors. The vast majority of subjects were self-
reported as of European Caucasian ancestry. All DNA samples were requantified and tested
for degradation and PCR amplification. Genotyping was performed using GeneChip 500K
arrays at the Affymetrix Services Lab (California): arrays not passing the 93% call rate
threshold at P=0.33 with the Dynamic Model algorithm were repeated. CEL (cell intensity)
files were transferred to WTCCC for quantile normalization, and genotypes called using a
new genotyping algorithm, CHIAMO, developed for this project. QC/QA measures included
sample call rate, overall heterozygosity and evidence of non-European ancestry (809
samples excluded; 16,179 retained for analysis). SNPs were excluded from analysis because
of missing data rates, departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and other metrics
(31,011 excluded; 469,557 retained). Standard 1-d.f. and 2-d.f. tests of case-control
association were supplemented with bayesian approaches, multilocus methods (data
imputation) and analyses with combined data sets, either as additional cases (to detect
variants influencing multiple phenotypes) or as an expanded reference group (to increase
power). Results for each SNP for all analyses reported will be available from http://
www.wtccc.org.uk, as will details allowing other researchers to apply for access to WTCCC
genotype data. Software packages developed within the WTCCC are available on request
(see Methods for details).

METHODS
BD phenotype description
BD cases were all over the age of 16 yr, living in mainland UK and of European descent.
Recruitment was undertaken throughout the UK by teams based in Aberdeen (8% of cases),
Birmingham (35% cases), Cardiff (33% cases), London (15% cases) and Newcastle (9%
cases). Individuals who had been in contact with mental health services were recruited if
they suffered with a major mood disorder in which clinically significant episodes of elevated
mood had occurred. This was defined as a lifetime diagnosis of a bipolar mood disorder
according to Research Diagnostic Criteria119 and included the bipolar subtypes that have
been shown in family studies to co-aggregate for example29: bipolar I disorder (71% cases),
schizoaffective disorder bipolar type (15% cases), bipolar II disorder (9% cases) and manic
disorder (5% cases). After providing written informed consent, all subjects were interviewed
by a trained psychologist or psychiatrist using a semi-structured lifetime diagnostic
psychiatric interview (in most cases the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in
Neuropsychiatry120 and available psychiatric medical records were reviewed). Using all
available data, best-estimate ratings were made for a set of key phenotypic measures on the
basis of the OPCRIT checklist (which covers both psychopathology and course of
illness)121,122 and lifetime psychiatric diagnoses were assigned according to the Research
Diagnostic Criteria119. The reliability of these methods has been shown to be
high119,123,124. Further details of clinical methodology can be found in Green, 2005 (ref.
123) and Green, 2006 (ref. 124).
CAD phenotype description
CAD cases had a validated history of either myocardial infarction or coronary
revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary angioplasty)
before their 66th birthday. Verification of the history of CAD was required either from
hospital records or the primary care physician. Recruitment was carried out on a national
basis in the UK through a direct approach to the public via (1) the media and (2) mailing all
general practices (family physicians) with information about the study, as previously
described125. In an initial pilot phase, potential participants were also identified and
approached through local CAD databases in the two lead centres (Leeds and Leicester).
Although the majority of subjects had at least one further sib also affected with premature
CAD, only one subject from each family was included in the present study.

CD phenotype description
CD cases were attendees at inflammatory bowel disease clinics in and around the five
centres which contributed samples to the WTCCC (Cambridge, Oxford, London, Newcastle,
Edinburgh). Ascertainment was based on a confirmed diagnosis of Crohn’s disease (CD)
using conventional endoscopic, radiological and histopathological criteria126. We included
all subtypes of CD as classified by disease extent and behaviour and the collection was not
specifically enriched for family history or early age of onset. The median age of diagnosis
was 26.1 yr and 62% of the collection had undergone CD-related abdominal surgery. A
small proportion had previously been recruited as members of multiply affected families but
only one affected individual was included per family.
HT phenotype description
HT cases comprised severely hypertensive probands ascertained from families with
multiplex affected sibships or as parent-offspring trios. They were of white British ancestry
(up to level of grand-parents) and were recruited from the Medical Research Council
General Practice Framework and other primary care practices in the UK77. Each case had a
history of hypertension diagnosed before 60 yr of age, with confirmed blood pressure
recordings corresponding to seated levels >150/100 mm Hg (if based on one reading), or the
mean of 3 readings greater than 145/95 mm Hg. These criteria correspond to the threshold
for the uppermost 5% of blood pressure distribution in a contemporaneous health screening
survey of 5,000 British men and women in 1995 (N. Wald and M. Law, personal
communication). We excluded hypertensive individuals who self-reportedly consumed >21
units of alcohol per week and those with diabetes, intrinsic renal disease, a history of
secondary hypertension or co-existing illness. Cases did not undergo systematic genetic
screening to exclude the (rare) known monogenic causes of HT. We focused on the
recruitment of hypertensive individuals with body mass indices <30 kg m-2. The probands
were extensively phenotyped by trained nurses (see http://www.brightstudy.ac.uk for
standard operating procedures, additional phenotypes and study questionnaires). Sample
selection for WTCCC was based on DNA availability and quality.
RA phenotype description
RA cases were recruited to studies coordinated by the ARC (Arthritis Research Campaign)
Epidemiology Unit. All subjects were Caucasian over the age of 18 yr and satisfied the 1987
American College of Rheumatology Criteria for RA127 modified for genetic studies128. Of
the cases, 404 were recruited as part of the arc National Repository of Family Material129:
of these, 301 were probands from affected sibling pair families and 103 were cases from trio
families, having both parents or one parent and one unaffected sibling available for study. A
further 109 cases were recruited from the Norfolk Arthritis Register, a primary care-based
inception collection130. All other cases (n=1348) were recruited from NHS Rheumatology
Clinics throughout the UK. Samples for WTCCC were selected from the various studies on
the basis of the quality and availability of DNA.
T1D phenotype description
T1D cases were recruited from paediatric and adult diabetes clinics at 150 National Health
Service hospitals across mainland UK. The total T1D case data set (n=~8,000) from which
the WTCCC cases were selected, represents close to half the T1D cases seen in such clinics.
Nationwide coverage was achieved through the voluntary efforts of members of the British
Society for Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetes, who recruited about half of cases, the
rest coming from peripatetic nurses employed by the JDRF/WT GRID project (http://www-
gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/todd/)131. To establish a positive diagnosis of T1D (and, in particular,
to distinguish it from the more common, but later onset T2D), we required all cases to have

an age of diagnosis below 17 yr and insulin dependence since diagnosis (with a minimum
period of at least 6 months). However, a very few subjects were subsequently discovered to
be suffering from rare monogenic disorders, such as maturity onset diabetes of the young
(MODY), and latterly permanent neonatal diabetes (PNDM): these were excluded.
T2D phenotype description
The T2D cases were selected from UK Caucasian subjects who form part of the Diabetes
UK Warren 2 repository. In each case, the diagnosis of diabetes was based on either current
prescribed treatment with sulphonylureas, biguanides, other oral agents and/or insulin or, in
the case of individuals treated with diet alone, historical or contemporary laboratory
evidence of hyperglycaemia (as defined by the World Health Organization). Other forms of
diabetes (for example, maturity-onset diabetes of the young, mitochondrial diabetes, and
type 1 diabetes) were excluded by standard clinical criteria based on personal and family
history. Criteria for excluding autoimmune diabetes included absence of first-degree
relatives with T1D, an interval of ≥1 yr between diagnosis and institution of regular insulin
therapy and negative testing for antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD).
Cases were limited to those who reported that all four grandparents had exclusively British
and/or Irish origin, by both self-reported ethnicity and place of birth. All were diagnosed
between age 25 and 75. Approximately 30% were explicitly recruited as part of multiplex
sibships132 and ~25% were offspring in parent-offspring ‘trios’ or ‘duos’ (that is, families
comprising only one parent complemented by additional sibs)133. The remainder were
recruited as isolated cases but these cases were (compared to population-based cases) of
relatively early onset and had a high proportion of T2D parents and/or siblings134. Cases
were ascertained across the UK but were centred around the main collection centres (Exeter,
London, Newcastle, Norwich, Oxford). Selection of the samples typed in WTCCC from the
larger collections was based primarily on DNA availability and success in passing Diabetes
and Inflammation Laboratory (DIL)/Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) DNA quality
control.
1958 Birth Cohort Controls (58BC)
The 1958 Birth Cohort (also known as the National Child Development Study) includes all
births in England, Wales and Scotland, during one week in 1958. From an original sample of
over 17,000 births, survivors were followed up at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33 and 42 yr (http://
www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/studies.asp?section=000100020003)135. In a biomedical examination at
44-45 yr136 (http://www.b58cgene.sgul.ac.uk/followup.php), 9,377 cohort members were
visited at home providing 7,692 blood samples with consent for future Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV)-transformed cell lines. DNA samples extracted from 1,500 cell lines of self-reported
white ethnicity and representative of gender and each geographical region were selected for
use as controls.
UK Blood Services Controls (UKBS)
The second set of common controls was made up of 1,500 individuals selected from a
sample of blood donors recruited as part of the current project. WTCCC in collaboration
with the UK Blood Services (NHSBT in England, SNBTS in Scotland and WBS in Wales)
set up a UK national repository of anonymized samples of DNA and viable mononuclear
cells from 3,622 consenting blood donors, age range 18-69 yr (ethical approval 05/
Q0106/74). A set of 1,564 samples was selected from the 3622 samples recruited based on
sex and geographical region (to reproduce the distribution of the samples of the 1958 Birth
Cohort) for use as common controls in the WTCCC study. DNA was extracted as described
below with a yield of 3054 ± 1207 μg (mean ± 1 s.d.).

Protocol for DNA extraction
White blood cells were isolated from the filters by first pushing 10 ml air through the filter
in contra direction to the initial blood flow through the filter, followed by 40 ml PBS,
collecting into a 50 ml centrifuge tube, and centrifugation (2.000 r.p.m., 10 min, 20
°C).Cells were lysed by adding 40 ml Lysis buffer (320 mM Sucrose, 1% Triton-X-100, 4.9
mM MgCl2, 1 mM TRIS-HCl pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation (2,500 r.p.m., 15 min,
4 °C). Pellets were frozen before extraction. Pellets were digested overnight at 37 °C with
5.25 M GuHCl, 490 mM NH4Ac, 1.25% Na Sarcosyl and 0.125 mg ml-1 Proteinase K and
then mixed with 2 ml chloroform to form a white emulsion. The aqueous layer was
separated by centrifugation (2,500 r.p.m., 3 min) and DNA was precipitated in ethanol
overnight at -20 °C. DNA was further precipitated by rotation (40 r.p.m., 5 min) and then
pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 r.p.m., 15 min). Pellets were washed twice by rinsing with
2 ml 70% ethanol, followed by centrifugation (3,000 r.p.m., 5 min). DNA pellets were air-
dried before re-suspension in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 0.1 mM EDTA).
Sample handling
Each participating sample collection was issued unique WTCCC barcode labels and a
spreadsheet with unique sample identifiers for logging information on case/control status,
DNA concentration (requested at 100 ng μl-1), DNA extraction method, sex, broad
geographical region and age at requirement. Each collection supplied 10 μg aliquots of
anonymized samples in bar-coded, deep 96-well plates. On receipt, samples had their DNA
concentration measured by Picogreen (triplicate measurements), were checked for DNA
degradation on a 0.75% agarose gel, and genotyped with up to 38 SNPs arranged in two
multiplex reactions using the MassExtend (hME) and/or iPLEX37 assay. The above SNPs
served for obtaining a molecular fingerprint (25 of the 38 SNPs were present on the
GeneChip 500K) and experimentally confirming the sex of each sample.
Samples with concentrations ≥50 ng μl-1 showing limited or no degradation, having a
minimum of 7/10 (hME reaction) and/or 14/23 (iPLEX reaction) SNPs typed, and having
the sex markers in agreement or not violating the supplied information were deemed fit for
whole genome genotyping. Note that the hME set was replaced with a second iPLEX
reaction in the course of the project to increase marker density. We selected 2,000 and 1,500
samples from each disease and control collection respectively. Selected samples were
normalized to 50 ng μl-1 and re-arrayed robotically into 96-well plates so that each plate was
composed of 94 samples representing at least two different collections at a ratio of 1:1. For
each collection, the selected samples were balanced first for sex and then geographical
region (see above).
Genotyping
SNP genotyping was performed with the commercial release of the GeneChip 500K arrays
at Affymetrix Services Lab. A modified version of the genotyping assay developed for the
100K Mapping Array137 was used. In brief, two aliquots of 250 ng of DNA each are
digested with NspI and StyI, respectively, an adaptor is ligated and molecules are then
fragmented and labelled. At this stage each enzyme preparation is hybridized to the
corresponding SNP array (262,000 and 238,000 on the NspI and StyI array respectively).
Samples were processed in 96-well plate format, each plate carried a positive and a negative
control, up to the hybridization step. Individual arrays not passing the 93% call rate
threshold at P=0.33 with the Dynamic Model algorithm138 were repeated (fresh aliquot of
initial end-labelled reaction). Samples failing twice at the hybridization stage were
reprocessed using a fresh DNA aliquot. Affymetrix delivered successful samples as those
having a Dynamic Model call rate of 93% at P=0.33 for each array, over 90% concordance

for the 50 SNPs that are common to the two arrays, both arrays agreed on gender, and
showed over 70% identity to the Sequenom genotypes supplied by WTCCC.
CEL files provided the intensities of the various probes on each chip. Initially, genotypes
were called with the Dynamic Model138 algorithm. Affymetrix subsequently developed an
improved algorithm, BRLMM (Bayesian Robust Linear Model with Mahalanobis distance
classifier139,140). This processes batches of samples and uses clustering techniques to call
genotypes (the ‘mismatch’ probe intensities are not used). In Affymetrix’s standard protocol
it is applied in batches of 96 samples (plates). This is, of course, a very small sample size
and, for some SNPs, some clusters will contain few, if any, observations. This might be
countered by combining information about cluster location over a large number of SNPs.
Throughout, physical coordinates refer to NCBI build-35 of the human genome. Alleles are
expressed in the forward (+) strand of the reference human genome (NCBI build-35).
Power calculations
We assessed power of the Affymetrix 500K chip using the following simulation experiment.
Separately for each SNP with MAF >5% in the 10 HapMap ENCODE regions, we assumed
the SNP was causative and simulated genotype data at all SNPs in the same region as the
putative disease SNP in case-control panels of 2,000 cases and 3,000 controls with linkage
disequilibrium patterns that match those in HapMap. For controls, these simulations were
based on the imputation algorithm described below (with all genotype data initially set to
missing in the 3,000 control individuals). For cases, the assumed effect size was first used to
calculate genotype frequencies in cases (via Bayes’ theorem), and genotypes in cases at the
putative SNP were then simulated independently from theses calculated frequencies.
Genotypes at all other SNPs in the region in cases were then simulated using the imputation
algorithm described below (with all data other than the genotypes at the causative SNP
initially set to missing in the cases). For each such simulated case-control panel, trend tests
were performed at each of the SNPs in the region that are actually on the Affymetrix chip,
and if any of these reached the stated P-value threshold the putative disease SNP was
deemed to be detected, and otherwise to be undetected. Power estimates are then calculated
as the proportion of putative disease SNPs with MAFs>5% across the HapMap ENCODE
regions that are detected at the given P-value threshold. There are various approximations
here. Actual numbers of cases and controls for each disease are slightly smaller than the
3,000:2,000 values used in the simulations, but in the other direction, our simulations ignore
the possibility that a disease SNP might be detected by a genotyped SNP outside its
ENCODE region. The accuracy reported below of the imputation algorithm in imputing
genotypes leads us to believe these simulations should be a reasonable proxy for real data.
Some such simulation is needed if power calculations are to take account of the fact that any
given putative disease SNP could typically be detected by several SNPs on the chip.
Exploitation of this simulation approach to assess power across different platforms and SNP
chips and for different experimental designs will be reported elsewhere.
CHIAMO
We developed a new genotype calling algorithm, CHIAMO, which is applied after quantile
normalization of the data from each sample. A complete description is given in
Supplementary Information. We briefly summarize some features here. Normalized
intensities for each genotype were mapped to a two-dimensional intensity vector and then
we applied CHIAMO, which uses a bayesian hierarchical 4-class mixture model to call
genotypes for the whole project. We used optimization based on 12 random starts to find the
set of parameters  that maximize the posterior distribution of the model. This parameter
set was used to calculate the maximum a posteriori estimates of the probabilities of each

genotype call, , where Zij∈{0, 1, 2, 3}≡{AA, AB, BB, null} is the genotype
call for individual j in collection i. All CHIAMO genotype calls analysed in this paper were
based on an a posteriori probability threshold of 0.9 for making a call, following our analysis
of the relationship between concordance and missing data rates (data not shown). CHIAMO
differs from BRLMM in several respects: (1) it uses a different transformation of the CEL
files to give the two-dimensional summary for each individual at an SNP leading to better
defined clusters; (2) it makes use of mis-match probe signals; (3) it uses a different method
for fitting the clusters; and (4) it allows the data for all samples to be called simultaneously,
thus allowing better estimation of cluster location and shape parameters, while making
allowance for possible differences in these parameter values between case/control groups
that could arise as a result of differences in DNA quality. This is achieved using a
hierarchical statistical model that specifies the joint distribution of the three cluster centres,
their spread, and likely allele frequencies (using HapMap) and genotype frequencies
(centred on Hardy-Weinberg proportions but allowing some variation).
CHIAMO improved both call rate and accuracy in comparison to BRLMM, the current
standard Affymetrix calling algorithm (Supplementary Table 3)—it roughly halved missing
data rates and discordance rates with another platform. See Supplementary Information for
full details, discussion of some challenges for genotype calling, and example cluster plots
(Supplementary Figs 10 and 17).
Quantile-quantile plots
Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots are constructed by ranking a set of values of a statistic from
smallest to largest (the ‘order statistics’) and plotting them against their expected values,
given the assumption that the values have been sampled from a distribution of known
theoretical form (in our case, the chi-squared distribution, usually on one degree of freedom
—for example, the distribution of our trend tests under the null hypothesis). Deviations from
the line of equality indicate either that the theoretical distribution is incorrect, or that the
sample is contaminated with values generated in some other manner (for example, by a true
association). To aid interpretation of such plots we have also calculated 95% ‘concentration
bands’ (shaded grey in all Q-Q plots). These are formed by calculating, for each order
statistic, the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the distribution of the order statistic under random
sampling and the null hypothesis (for details see ref. 141). We should add two notes of
caution. First, concentration bands are calculated point by point and, although there are very
strong correlations between nearby order statistics, the probability that a real quantile-
quantile plot will stray outside the concentration band at some point is some bit larger than
5%. Second, the theoretical chi-squared distribution is an approximation, valid for large
samples; it is not clear whether this approximation continues to hold into the extreme right
hand tail of the distribution explored in a GWA study (although the indications are that it is
probably not far wrong for a study as large as ours).
Data quality control
Of samples for which Affymetrix returned CEL files, a total of 809 were excluded from the
analysis. A complete breakdown by collection is given in Supplementary Table 4. Missing
data rate per sample acts as an indicator of low DNA quality. Most samples had very low
rates of missing data (study-wide average 0.00925, standard deviation 0.0187) and we chose
to exclude 250 samples with >3% missing data across all SNPs (Supplementary Fig. 18, and
Supplementary Tables 4 and 13). We also set empirical thresholds on genome-wide
heterozygosity (excess heterozygosity in particular may indicate contamination). Six
samples with >30% heterozygosity and a further three with <23% heterozygosity were
excluded (see Supplementary Fig. 18). We excluded 16 samples with discrepancies between

WTCCC information and external identifying information (such as genotypes from another
experiment, blood type or incorrect disease status). We sought to detect individuals with
non-Caucasian ancestry using multi-dimensional scaling to provide a two-dimensional
projection of the data whose axes represent geographic genetic variation. In the interest of
computational efficiency and to avoid confounding of the multi-dimensional scaling by
extended linkage disequilibrium we thinned the data to a set of 71,458 SNPs, within which
no pair were correlated with r2>0.2. For this set of nearly independent SNPs we computed
genome-wide average identity by state (sum of the number of identical-by-state alleles at
each locus divided by twice the number of loci) between each pair of individuals in each
sample collection along with the 270 HapMap samples. We converted these identity by-
state-relationships to distances by subtracting them from 1, and the matrix of pairwise
identity by state values was used as input to multi-dimensional scaling. The projection onto
the two multi-dimensional scaling axes is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5. We excluded 153
samples that were clearly separate from the main cluster of WTCCC individuals. Exclusion
of these individuals resulted in a substantial reduction in estimates of over-dispersion in test
statistic distributions (data not shown). We also excluded 295 duplicated (>99% identity)
and 86 related (86-98% identity) samples from the analysis.
Filtering out suboptimal markers depends on both the platform and the genotype calling
algorithm. We experimented with various quality metrics for CHIAMO calls, for example,
based on the location and/or separation of the clusters, but found that the best indicator of a
SNP being difficult to call was the amount of missing data in its calls: CHIAMO
consistently marked many individuals missing for SNPs with poorly defined or overlapping
clusters, whereas it successfully called genotypes for nearly all individuals on high-quality
SNPs (data not shown). We excluded 26,567 SNPs with a study-wide missing data rate >5%
(Supplementary Fig. 19), or >1% for SNPs with a study-wide MAF<5%. We additionally
excluded 4,351 SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg exact P value <5.7×10-7 in the combined set of
2,938 controls, and 93 SNPs with P value <5.7×10-7 for either a one- or two-degree of
freedom test of association between the two control groups (corresponding to a 1 d.f. chi-
squared statistic of about 25). See Supplementary Fig. 20 and Fig. 1 respectively for the
empirical distributions of these statistics used to motivate the thresholds above.
Overall, we found that the 809 excluded individuals (which represent 4.8% of the study
samples) accounted for 35.6% of the missing data at non-excluded SNPs. In total, 469,557
SNPs passed the quality control filters.
Supplementary Fig. 20 shows the effect of quality control filters, and visual inspection of the
cluster plots of SNPs showing apparently strong association, on quantile-quantile plots for
one disease (T2D, others are similar), and the success of these filters in excluding poorly
performing SNPs. The figure (panel d) also shows the marked effect on the tails of the
distribution of test statistics of regions of genuine association (for this disease the three
regions removed because of strong evidence of association have all been independently
replicated, see main text). The aim in filtering is to exclude poor SNPs but without removing
genuine associations. No single criterion will do this. In order not to exclude possible
genuine associations, we chose to apply relatively light quality control filters but then to
subject all apparently associated SNPs to visual inspection of cluster plots (see
Supplementary Information). Around 100 cluster plots were assessed per disease.
We used X-chromosome SNPs to check for sex discrepancies with the sample files
(Supplementary Fig. 21). These were fed back to disease groups for amendment and
verification. The ~80 samples where it was not possible to discern the source of the
discrepancy were left in the study for analysis, on the grounds that mishandling was
considered unlikely to have introduced samples with altogether different phenotypes.

DNA quality between cases and controls could result in false-positive associations through
differential effects on genotype calling111. DNAs in our study came from various sources
between, and in some cases within, case and control series, but with the combination of
centralized sample quality control, simultaneous genotype calling with CHIAMO (which
explicitly allows for differences between collections), and inspection of cluster plots for
SNPs with very small P values, our study did not experience such difficulties.
Comparing linkage disequilibrium
Two questions which have been raised about the HapMap data are how well it describes
linkage disequilibrium in populations other than the ones that were sampled, and whether
the sample sizes in HapMap (60 Caucasian individuals, for example) are adequate to
describe patterns of linkage disequilibrium. With data on 2,938 controls and 16,179
individuals in total at around 400,000 polymorphic SNPs, we are well placed to address this
for the British population. Initial analyses suggest that patterns of linkage disequilibrium in
our samples are very similar to those in HapMap. As an example, Supplementary Fig. 3
compares patterns of linkage disequilibrium in HampMap CEU individuals and our 58C
sample at SNPs on the Affymetrix chip across 22× 1 Mb regions of the genome and they
seem almost identical. We calculated r2 values directly from the phased haplotypes available
in HapMap, but using unphased genotype data from our study. Note that visual
representations of linkage disequilibrium in this form can be very sensitive to SNP density
so comparisons across regions is difficult without correction for SNP density, and direct
comparison of linkage disequilibrium patterns at all HapMap SNPs with those at the subset
of SNPs on the Affymetrix 500K chip is not straightforward.
Geographical variation and population structure
Principal component analysis was performed as a two-stage process: we formed a matrix of
estimated correlations (formally, the inner product measure of similarity) between all pairs
of individuals, and then computed the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of that matrix. We
estimated the correlation between two individuals as described by14. We identified
components that reflected genome-wide structure in two ways. First, we created two subsets
of the data containing SNPs from the odd- and even-numbered chromosomes, repeated the
PCA on each of these, and inspected scatter plots of pairs of components between the two
subsets of the data. A component which is due to a region of linkage disequilibrium on a
chromosome (as opposed to genome-wide structure) will appear only when analysing the
data set containing SNPs from that chromosome. Second, we computed the score of every
SNP on the components. For a component that is due to a region of linkage disequilibrium,
there will be a spike of high SNP scores only in that region. To minimize the contribution
from regions of extensive strong linkage disequilibrium, the correlation estimates were
based on a subset of 197,175 SNPs that were spaced at least 0.001 cM apart (HapMap
estimates) and specifically excluded the MHC region.
To assess the level of over-dispersion in each collection we first created a very clean set of
data to ameliorate the effects of over-dispersion due to calling problems and missing data. In
addition to the main filters described above, we filtered out all SNPs that had a clear
genotype-calling problem revealed by visual inspection, SNPs with a study-wide missing
data rate >1% and SNPs with study-wide minor allele frequency <1%. Around 360,000
SNPs passed these filters. Estimates of λ were calculated using an estimator based on the
median test statistic15. Estiamtes of λ were also calculated from tests that conditioned on
the scores for each individual along the two estimated principal components described
above. The tests (1 d.f. and 2 d.f.) were carried out by including the scores as additional
covariates in a logistic regression model fit.

Bayes factors
The box in the main text makes the point that understanding the strength of evidence
conveyed by a particular P value also requires knowledge of power. In contrast, the Bayes
factor (BF) provides a single measure of the strength of the evidence for an association, and
we report these in addition to P values (Supplementary Table 14). As for power, calculation
of Bayes factors requires assumptions about effect sizes. The assumptions underlying our
calculations are given below and in Supplementary Information.
There is broad agreement between the way in which P values and our Bayes factors rank
SNPs, except for SNPs with low MAFs (Supplementary Fig. 22). This is intuitive: unless
one believed, a priori, that rare causative SNPs have substantially larger effect sizes, there
will be reduced power for these SNPs and hence weaker evidence for association than for
common SNPs with the same P value.
One perspective on GWAs is that in practice they will be used to prioritize SNPs for further
study or additional typing. In addition to BFs providing a single quantity that can be directly
compared between SNPs, it is also straightforward for investigators to give different a priori
weights to different classes of SNPs, such as non-synonymous (ns)SNPs, genic SNPs, SNPs
in highly conserved regions, or SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with many (or few) other
SNPs.
We now describe calculation of the Bayes factors. We use M0 to denote a model of no
association, M1 for a model with an additive effect on the log-odds scale and M2 for a
general 3 parameter model of association. At each SNP we calculate two Bayes factors: one
for the additive model versus the null model, BF1, and one for the general model versus the
null model, BF2. That is,
where Pr(Data|Mi) = ∫ Pr(Data|θi, Mi)Pr(θi|Mi)dθ, where θ denotes the parameters for the
model. For all 3 models we use a logistic regression model for the likelihood Pr(Data|θi, Mi)
where the log-odds for individual i is equal to μ for model M0, μ+γZi for model M1 and μ
+γI(Zi+ϕ(2γI(Zi=2)) for model M2. Zi is the genotype (coded 0, 1 and 2) for individual i
and I(Zi=m) is the indicator function that individual i has the genotype coded as m. For each
model we choose the priors on the parameters, Pr(θi|Mi), to reflect our belief about the likely
effect sizes underlying complex trait loci.
The parameter γ in models M1 and M2 is the increase in log-odds of disease for every copy
of the allele coded as 1, and eγ is the additive model odds ratio. For both models we use a
N(0, 0.2) prior on γ. This prior puts probability 0.31 on odds ratios above 1.2 or below 0.8,
and probability 0.02 on odds ratios above 1.5 or below 0.5. The parameter μ in all three
models represents the baseline odds of disease. In a case-control design the numbers of cases
in the sample have been elevated artificially, which will have a large effect on likely values
of μ. Our prior beliefs about the baseline risk of disease must take this into account. For all
three models we have used a N(0, 1) for μ and have found that the resulting Bayes factors
are relatively insensitive to choice of priors for this parameter as long as the same prior is
used for the two models being compared. The parameter ϕ in model M2 represents a
recessive effect over and above an additive effect. We use a N(1, 1) prior for ϕ. Combined
with the prior on γ, this results in a prior probability of 0.25 on the odds ratios above 1.5 and
below 0.5 for the genotype coded as 2. In addition, we note that the evaluation of the Bayes
factors will depend on the way the alleles at the SNP have been coded 0 and 1. To account

for this we average over the two possible codings of each SNP with equal weight. A fuller
description of the priors used can be found in Supplementary Information.
Sex-differentiated tests
We examined the possibility of differential genetic effects in males and females by
reapplying the two single-locus analyses (trend test and genotypic test) separately in males
and females and combining the results (simply adding the chi-squared statistics for the male
and female analyses, and comparing with the 2 d.f. or 4 d.f. null hypothesis; results are
shown in Supplementary Table 15). We refer to this as a sex-differentiated test. This test is
sensitive to association that is of a different magnitude and/or direction in the two sexes,
although it is less powerful than the simple test when the effect size does not vary with sex.
X Chromosome analysis
For several reasons the X chromosome needs to be treated differently from the autosomes
(note that the Affymetrix chip used does not assay the Y chromosome). First, samples sizes
and hence power are different from the autosomes (only one copy of X in males). Also,
because the effective population size on the X chromosome is smaller than the autosomes,
linkage disequilibrium extends further. And unlike the autosomes, there are choices in how
to implement even single locus analyses: these relate to the relative weight to be given to
males and females in comparisons between cases and controls.
For autosomal SNPs, the 1 d.f. trend test statistic is calculated by dividing the square of the
difference between means of the SNP genotypes (scored 0, 1, 2) between cases and controls
by an estimate of its variance. The variance estimate used is an empirical estimate that does
not assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The numerator can also be represented as the
squared difference in allele frequencies between cases and controls, as in the allele counting
test. At first sight, a natural generalization of this test to deal with SNPs on the X
chromosome would involve comparing allele frequencies, by allele counting, but using a
variance estimate which does not assume Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in females.
However, we took the view that, because most loci on the X chromosome are subject to X
chromosome inactivation, it is more logical to treat males as if they were homozygous
females. Thus we score female genotypes 0, 1 or 2 and male genotypes 0 or 2, comparing
mean scores of cases and controls as before. The variance estimate allows for the different
variance of male and female contributions and does not assume Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium in females.
A stratified version of the test is constructed using the same principles by which the trend
test is extended to the Mantel extension test; a score that contrasts cases and controls is
computed for each stratum together with its variance; these are then summed over strata.
The final test is the squared total score divided by the total variance. To extend these tests to
a 2 d.f. test, we add a score that compares heterozygosity between cases and controls.
Clearly, only females contribute to this component. Results of these analyses of X
chromosome SNPs are shown in Supplementary Table 16.
Multilocus analysis
We use (1) the genotype data of this study, (2) the HapMap data, and (3) a population
genetics model, to simulate genotypes at the HapMap SNPs that are not on the Affymetrix
500K chip. Informally, we determine which haplotypes are present in each individual in a
region, and then use HapMap to ‘fill in’ these haplotypes at untyped SNPs (see below for
details). These ‘in silico’ genotypes are then tested for association with the disease as before.
This powerful multilocus tool for association studies143 has the advantage of using
information from all markers in linkage disequilibrium with an untyped SNP, but in a way

that decreases with genetic distance. Our imputation method was applied to individuals
passing project filters, and used markers which passed the project filters and in addition had
MAF>1%. As a validation we compared our imputed genotypes for 58C individuals with
genotypes obtained on an Illumina platform for 10,180 SNPs that are polymorphic in CEU
HapMap samples. At these SNPs, for imputed genotypes with posterior call probabilities
above 0.95, there was 98.4% agreement with the Illumina genotypes.
In our association analyses we imputed genotypes at 2,139,483 HapMap SNPs, and tested
these for association with each disease using the trend test or the genotypic test. We
included the results from imputed SNPs in the signal plots (Fig. 5) because they are useful in
(1) assessing signal strength within a region; (2) providing a wider range of SNPs for follow
up; and (3) indicating possible locations for the causal variant. For example in the case of
TCF7L2 in T2D, there is a substantially stronger signal from rs7903146 than for any of the
typed SNPs (see also Supplementary Fig. 12).
To be conservative, stringent quality control filters were applied to genomic regions where
imputed SNPs (but not genotyped SNPs) were responsible for a strong signal for
association. These were as follows: (1) any such region was required to contain more than
one imputed SNP showing the required level of association with a MAF>2% and posterior
probability for imputed genotypes averaged across the SNP>0.95 (empirical studies showed
imputation at low MAF SNPs more prone to error); (2) all cluster plots for genotyped SNPs
within 0.3 cM (from HapMap Phase II estimated recombination rates) were checked and
where there was evidence of any mis-calling the region was rejected (the major problem
with imputation arises around SNPs with genotype calling errors); and (3) if there was no
genotyped SNP with a P value<10-4 for association on either trend or genotypic test, the
region was rejected. Note that accuracy of imputation with these filters applied will be larger
than the figure of 98.4% reported above.
We use H={H1,..., HN} to denote a set of N known haplotypes where Hi={Hi1,..., HiL} is an
individual haplotype and L is the number of SNP loci. In practice, we set H to be the 120
CEU haplotypes estimated as part of the HapMap project owing to the expected similarity in
haplotype structure between the CEU and UK populations. We let G={G1,..., Gk} denote the
genotype data on the K individuals in the study where Gi={Gi1,..., GiL} and Gij∈{0, 1, 2,
missing}. In this setting, the majority of SNPs will have entirely missing genotypes, because
the Affymetrix 500K chip has approximately 1/6th of the number of SNPs in the Phase II
HapMap. The missing genotypes are imputed by modelling the distribution of each
individual’s genotype vector Gi conditional on the known set of haplotypes H, Pr(Gi|H). Our
model for each individual’s genotype vector is a Hidden Markov Model in which the hidden
states are a sequence of pairs of the N known haplotypes in the set H. That is,
where  and  are the two sequences of copying states
at the L sites and . Here,  defines our prior probability on how
the sequences of copying states change along the sequence and  models
how the observed genotypes will be close to but not exactly the same as the haplotypes
being copied. The precise form of these terms (described in ref. 142) are based on an
approximate population genetics model that makes direct use of the recently estimated fine-
scale recombination map across the genome142,143. At each of the missing genotypes in the

study, we use this model to calculate probabilities for the three possible genotypes. At each
imputed SNP, we used these probabilities to calculate the 2×3 table of expected genotype
counts for cases and controls and used these counts to carry out a standard test of
association.
Disease models
To test for deviations from additivity (in log-odds) at a locus we fit a logistic regression
model using the function glm in the statistical software R (http://www.r-project.org/). For
each region we considered the most significant SNP and compared an additive model to a
general 2-d.f. model by fitting a model with an additive sub-model nested in a general
model. The additive effect was modelled by a variable encoded 0, 1, or 2 for the effect at the
three genotypes and a second term for a general model was included by a variable encoded 1
for heterozygotes and 0 otherwise. We rejected an additive model if the second term was
significant and then compared a dominant or recessive model to a general model. For the
pairwise interaction analysis, we fixed the marginal model at each locus on the basis of the
single locus analysis. We compared the two locus model with these marginals and no
interaction terms with a larger model including interactions. This larger interaction model
has 1, 2, or 4 additional parameters depending on whether both marginal models are
additive, one is additive and one general, or both general.
Software
Several software packages were developed within the WTCCC for data analysis, data
management and simulation studies. We found it necessary to normalize the Affymetrix
probe intensity data to minimize chip-to-chip variability. A C++ program was written to
carry out this normalization efficiently. To obtain a copy of the software please email Hin-
Tak Leung at hin-tak.leung@cimr.cam.ac.uk.
We developed a new genotype calling algorithm, CHIAMO, implemented in C++.
CHIAMO uses a hierarchical statistical model, which allows it to simultaneously call
genotypes at all data samples. To obtain a copy of the software please email J. L. Marchini
at marchini@stas.ox.ac.uk.
To perform genome-wide association analysis we developed two software packages:
snpMatrix and SNPTEST. snpMatrix is an R package and is freely available from http://
www-gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/. Both quantitative and qualitative phenotypes
can by analysed using snpMatrix and flexible association testing functions are provided that
control for potential confounding by quantitative and qualitative covariates. SNPTEST is a
standalone C++ program that implements both frequentist tests and bayesian analysis of
association and allows the user to include quantitative or qualitative covariates. This
program works directly with the output of CHIAMO and IMPUTE (see below). To obtain a
copy of the software please email J. L. Marchini at marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk.
Genotypes at SNPs that are in HapMap but not on the Affymetrix 500K chip were imputed
using the C++ program IMPUTE, which makes use of genotype information at neighbouring
SNPs. To obtain a copy of the software please email J. L. Marchini at
marchini@stats.ox.ac.uk.

Figure 1. Genome-wide scan for allele frequency differences between controls
a, P values from the trend test for differences between SNP allele frequencies in the two
control groups, stratified by geographical region. SNPs have been excluded on the basis of
failure in a test for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in either control group considered
separately, a low call rate, or if minor allele frequency is less than 1%, but not on the basis
of a difference between control groups. Green dots indicate SNPs with a P value <1×10-5. b,
Quantile-quantile plots of these test statistics. In this and subsequent quantile-quantile plots,
the shaded region is the 95% concentration band (see Methods).

Figure 3. Quantile-quantile plots for seven genome-wide scans
For each of the seven disease collections, a quantile-quantile plot of the results of the trend
test is shown in black for all SNPs that pass the standard project filters, have a minor allele
frequency >1% and missing data rate <1%. SNPs that were visually inspected and revealed
genotype calling problems were excluded. These filters were chosen to minimize the
influence of genotype-calling artefacts. Each quantile-quantile plot shown in black involves
around 360,000 SNPs. SNPs at which the test statistic exceeds 30 are represented by
triangles. Additional quantile-quantile plots, which also exclude all SNPs located in the
regions of association listed in Table 3, are superimposed in blue (for BD, the exclusion of
these SNPs has no visible effect on the plot, and for HT there are no such SNPs). The blue
quantile-quantile plots show that departures in the extreme tail of the distribution of test
statistics are due to regions with a strong signal for association.

Figure 4. Genome-wide scan for seven diseases
For each of seven diseases -log10 of the trend test P value for quality-control-positive SNPs,
excluding those in each disease that were excluded for having poor clustering after visual
inspection, are plotted against position on each chromosome. Chromosomes are shown in
alternating colours for clarity, with P values <1×10-5 highlighted in green. All panels are
truncated at -log10(P value)=15, although some markers (for example, in the MHC in T1D
and RA) exceed this significance threshold.

Figure 5. Regions of the genome showing strong evidence of association
Characteristics of genomic regions 1.25 Mb to either side of ‘hit SNPs’—SNPs with lowest
P values. Region boundaries (vertical dotted lines) were chosen to coincide with locations
where test statistics returned to background levels and, where possible, recombination
hotspots. Upper panel, -log10(P values) for the test (trend or genotypic) with the smallest P
value at the hit SNP. Black points represent SNPs tyred in the study, and grey points
represent SNPs whose genotypes were imputed. SNPs imputed with higher confidence are
shown in darker grey. Middle panel, fine-scale recombination rate (centimorgans per Mb)
estimated from Phase II HapMap. The purple line shows the cumulative genetic distance (in
cM) from the hit SNP. Lower panel, known genes, and sequence conservation in 17

vertebrates. Known genes (orange) in the hit region are listed in the upper right part of each
plot in chromosomal order, starting at the left edge of the region. The top track shows plus-
strand genes and the middle track shows minus-strand genes. Sequence conservation
(bottom track) scores are based on the phylogenetic hidden Markov model phastCons.
Highly conserved regions (phastCons score≥600) are shown in blue. Information in middle
and lower panels is taken from the USCS Genome Browser. Positions are in NCBI build-35
coordinates. See Supplementary Information on ‘signal plots.’

Figure 6. Strong associations in subsamples of our data
For the 16 SNPs in Table 3 (outside the MHC) with P values for the trend test below 5×10-7
we randomly generated 1,000 subsets of our full data set corresponding to case-control
studies with different numbers of cases, and the same number of controls (x axis). The y axis
gives the proportion of subsamples of a given size in which that SNP achieved a P value for
the trend test below 5×10-7. SNPs are numbered according to the row in which they occur in
Table 3 (so that, for example, the CAD hit is numbered 2, and the TCF7L2 hit on
chromosome 10 for T2D is numbered 20).
