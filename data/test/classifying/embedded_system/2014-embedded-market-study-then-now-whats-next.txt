2014 Embedded Market Study 
Purpose and Methodology 
• Purpose: To profile the findings of the 2014 results of UBM Tech’s annual 
comprehensive survey of the embedded systems markets worldwide. Findings 
include types of technology used, all aspects of the embedded development 
process, IoT emergence, tools used, work environment, applications, methods/ 
processes, operating systems used, reasons for using chips and technology, and 
brands and chips currently used by or being considered by embedded developers. 
Many questions in this survey are trended over three to five years.  
• Methodology: A web-based online survey instrument based on the previous year’s 
survey was developed and implemented by independent research company Wilson 
Research Group from January 18, 2014 to February 21, 2014 by email invitation 
• Sample: E-mail invitations were sent to subscribers to UBM Tech Embedded Brands 
with one reminder invitation. Each invitation included a link to the survey. 
• Returns: 2,258 valid respondents for an overall confidence of 95% +/- 2.0%. 
Confidence for questions with 1000 respondents = +/-3.0%, 400 respondents = +/-
5.0%, this latter is considered a standard for most market research.

Current Embedded Design Environment: Key Takeaways 
• Trend toward smaller teams 
• Slow but steady trend toward longer development cycles 
• 12.6 months average in 2014 vs. 12.2 months average in 2010  
• Meeting deadlines getting more and more difficult 
• “On schedule” project completion trending downward 
• 41% in 2014 while previous 4 years 42-44% for “Ahead of” or “On schedule”  
• No upstarts in terms of programming languages 
• High (86%) and steady reuse of code is expected to continue. Reused 
“purchased” code is declining.

Embedded Design Process: Key Takeaways 
• Meeting schedules remains the premier challenge for development with the 
debugging process is not far behind. 
• Time devoted to debugging is second only to “detailed design stage”. Newly 
added “meeting performance standards” ranks 5th. 
• Design projects average 3 external vendors, and these vendors are found largely 
through referrals and web research. 
• Engineering team skill and scheduling increased in concern with debugging and 
programming tools decreasing in concern across improving embedded design 
activities over the last five years. 
• Vendor websites continue to be extremely important to developers as sources of 
information, while newly-added technical standards, vendor technical support forums, 
and software APIs, show strength. 
• Integrating new technology and managing code size are the number 1 and 2 
technology challenges. OS/RTOS challenges have risen significantly from 12% in 
2012-13 to 17% in 2014.  
• Top five ways to maintain professional skills over last three years have been very 
consistent: training courses offered online; technical/white papers; webinars by 
vendors; webinars by media orgs. Online training courses and webinars from 
professional associations are steadily increasing over the last three years.

Operating Systems: Key Takeaways 
• Current usage trending toward open source, up from 29% in 2010 to 36% 
in 2014. 
• First time open source OSes has outpaced commercial OSes; 38% in 
2010 to 33% in 2014.  
• Main reasons are: no need for multitasking, cost and not having to rely on a 
commercial supplier  
• SW engineering staff and their managers are the decision makers on 
choosing an operating system 
• No switching: Using the same OS, RTOS or kernel from the previous 
project occurs at the rate of about 6 out of 10 projects. 
• Downward trend in use of in-house/custom OSes reflects the five year 
downward trend seen earlier in the usage of In-house/custom solutions. 
• Android is the number one OS under consideration. 5% gain in Free RTOS 
from 21% in 2013 to 26% in 2014 is a contender for the #1 position for 
2015.

Microprocessors: Key Takeaways 
• Whereas software engineers dominate decisions regarding OSes, hardware 
engineers and their managers dominate decisions regarding the choice of 
processors.  
• The average number of processors/microcontrollers per project is 2.4; half of all 
projects use just one processor.  
• Slow and steady increase of 32-bit chips with the same decline of 8-bit chips. 
• Same processors are used project to project; the rationale is: maintaining software 
compatibility and using the same tools achieves efficiency.  
• The decision to switch processors is driven by better features (#1), 
speed/performance and future growth.  
• The ecosystem surrounding the chip itself leads in most important when choosing a  
microprocessor over the chip itself and the chips supplier/vendor. 
• ARM is in three of the top 5 positions for 32-bit chip families considered for next 
embedded project. 
• Just under 3 in 10 projects have been ungraded from 8/16-bit chips to 32-bit chips.

FPGAs, Memory, LCDs: Key Takeaways 
• FPGA usage is trending steadily downward from 45% six years ago to 
31% last year, rising very slightly this year to 32%. May indicate a 
bottoming or a pause in the trend downwards.  
• There is a gradual decline of FPGAs/programmable logic usage in 
upcoming embedded projects: 60% said “yes” in 2005, down to 41% in 
2014. 
• Not needing the functionality, cost and difficulty programming are the 
main reasons for not using customizable chips/FPGAs.

Hardware IPs, System Level Design 
& Use of GUIs: Key Takeaways 
• A little more than 7 in 10 respondents reuse hardware or hardware IP from 
previous projects. This reuse pattern has remained stable for 5 years. 
• Three of the top four influencers of system-level tools are staff 
engineers. 
• Embedded projects are managed mostly by Microsoft Excel and Microsoft 
Project. 
• Although down a bit, Subversion maintains its lead in version control 
software, but Git and CVS gain.
