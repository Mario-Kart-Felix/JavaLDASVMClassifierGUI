Finding an Answer 
One day an individual went to the horse races. Instead of 
counting the number of humans and horses, she counted  
74 heads and 196 legs.     
How many humans and horses were there?

How many humans and horses were there? 
 
 humans         + horses        =   74 
 humans × 2  + horses × 4 = 196

 horses    = 24 
 humans = 50 
What is an Answer? 
The purpose of computing is insight,                                 
not numbers.

Computer Algebra 
Having the computer figure out the formulas 
 
rather than using formulas given by humans. 
 
• Algorithms  – computational mathematics 
• Software  – mathematical computation 
 
Computer Algebra 
Start with symbols  
                           and compute with symbols => 
• Exact results 
• Hopefully, insightful results 
Finding an Answer 
One day an individual went to the horse races. Instead of 
counting the number of humans and horses, she counted  
H heads and L legs.     
How many humans and horses were there? 
 
   humans         + horses        =   H 
   humans × 2  + horses × 4 =   L

   humans         + horses        =   H 
   humans × 2  + horses × 4 =   L 
 
   horses    = ‒H + L/2  
   humans = 2 H ‒ L/2 
Computer Algebra Software 
Example: Maple 
 
An Example (small) 
 
• Two polynomials 
 
• School method 
 
 
• Multiplication costs O(d 2 ) 
Computer Algebra Algorithms 
Example: Polynomial Multiplication 
• Point-wise  Value Method 
 
 
 
 
 
• DFT trick:  evaluate at “roots of unity” 
 
 
• Multiplication now O(d log d ) 
 
 
Computer Algebra Algorithms 
Example: Polynomial Multiplication 
So?     
For What is Computer Algebra Used? 
• Any work involving lengthy formulas, e.g. 
– Formulas for location of the moon for Apollo. 
– Martinus Veltman + Gerardus ’t Hooft 
1999 Nobel prize in physics (renormalized YM theory) 
– Cryptographic arms race (making + breaking) 
 
• Education 
– Students can do more interesting examples 
 
• Engineering 
– Faster and more flexible design cycle 
Modeling Canadarm & Canadarm 2 
• Each arm has 7 actuators and 22 degrees of freedom. 
• Arm cannot support its own weight on Earth  
so modeling is required. 
• Simulink  to describe system topology 
• Maple manipulates the model  
and generates C code. 
Computer Animation 
• PDI/Dreamworks 
• Shading model experiments 
• Special FX in volume rendering.  
• Partial differential equations  
for water simulation 
 
Green Engineering 
• High fidelity battery models hybrid-
electric vehicles.  
• Multi-domain model, automatically 
generated and optimized equations 
from MapleSim. 
• SkySails GMBH: wind propulsion systems 
• Sail + Control System 
• Maple used for simulation software. 
Research Interests 
• To expand what mathematical software can do. 
 
• Compilers and programming languages 
• Mathematical algorithms 
• Software systems 
• Human/computer interfaces 
Algorithms for Symbolic Polynomials 
 
Algorithms for Approximate Polynomials 
• 𝑓 = 𝑦2 − 𝑥4   =  𝑦 − 𝑥2 𝑦 + 𝑥2  
 
• 𝑓∗ = 𝑦2 − 𝑥4 + .01𝑥2 
 
    ≈ 𝑦 − 𝑥2 + .00500 𝑦 + 𝑥2 − .00504

Digital Ink 
The Big Picture 
• Want computers to be as easy, natural and 
powerful for mathematics as they are for natural 
language. 
 
• Powerful programming languages, algorithms, 
user interfaces – extend these areas as needed.
