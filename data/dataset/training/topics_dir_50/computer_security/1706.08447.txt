ON THE SELECTION OF POLYNOMIALS FOR THE DLP
ALGORITHM
GIACOMO MICHELI
Abstract. In this paper we characterize the set of polynomials f ∈ Fq[X]
satisfying the following property: there exists a positive integer d such that for
any positive integer ℓ ≤ deg(f) there exists t0 in Fqd such that the polynomial
f − t0 has an irreducible factor of degree ℓ over Fqd [X]. This result is then
used to progress in the last step which is needed to remove the heuristic from
one of the quasi-polynomial time algorithms for discrete logarithm problems
(DLP) in small characteristic. Our characterization allows a construction of
polynomials satisfying the wanted property.
1. Introduction
For long time the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) over finite fields has been
one of the most important primitives used for cryptographic protocols. The major
breakthrough in recent years concerning DLPs in small characteristic consists of
the heuristic quasi-polynomial time algorithms given in [1, 3] (see also [5, 2] for
their origins).
In this paper we focus on algorithm [3] which only relies on the field represen-
tation heuristic (see [3, p.2]). In fact, if that can be proved, this would show that
DLP in small characteristic can indeed be solved in quasi polynomial time. Our
results characterize a class of polynomials which is particularly suitable for per-
forming the DLP-quasi polynomial time algorithm described in [3] and show that
if one wants to select polynomials satisfying the wanted property, these have to
be chosen in this class (see Theorem 11). Our constructions involve some Galois
theory over function fields, group theory and Chebotarev density theorem. Let us
start with the motivating conjecture, which has to be proved in order to remove
the remaining heuristic from the algorithm in [3].
Conjecture 1. For any finite field Fq and any fixed positive integer ℓ = O(q),
there exists and integer d = O(log(q)) and h1, h2 ∈ Fqd [X] coprime of degree at
most 2 such that h1X
q + h2 has an irreducible factor of degree ℓ.

If this conjecture is true, then DLP in small characteristic can be solved in
non-heuristic quasi-polynomial time as described in the algorithm presented in
[3].
Such kind of requirement also appeared in [1, Section 5] where it is observed
that the choice h1 = 1 and h2 = X
2 seems to always satisfy the requirements in
odd characteristic and for d = 2. This motivates us to formulate the following
Conjecture 2. Let Fq be a finite field of odd characteristic. There exists an
integer d = O(log(q)) and h1, h2 ∈ Fqd [X] coprime of degree at most 2 such that,
for any positive integer ℓ ≤ deg(h1)+q there exists t0 ∈ Fqd such that h1X
q+h2−t0
has an irreducible factor of degree ℓ.
A polynomial satisfying Conjecture 2 will allow to build extensions with the
correct representation and of desired degree.
In the next sections we will fit the conjecture above in a general context and will
show a characterization of polynomials satisfying a relaxed version of Conjecture
2, in fact we will be able to prove
Theorem 3. Let Fq be a finite field of odd characteristic. There exists an integer
d ∈ N and h1, h2 ∈ Fqd [X] coprime of degree at most 2 such that, for any positive
integer ℓ ≤ deg(h1) + q there exists t0 ∈ Fqd such that h1X
q + h2 − t0 has an
irreducible factor of degree ℓ. Moreover, such polynomials can be constructed
explicitely.
In fact, we characterize completely polynomials f ∈ Fq[X] having the property
that there exists a d ∈ N such that for any ℓ ∈ N, there exists t0 ∈ Fqd such that
f − t0 has an irreducible factor of degree ℓ in Fqd [X].
On the theoretical side, our result shows the existence of such d for a certain
class of polynomials, which is the first step in the attempt of giving an explicit
bound. In practice, our methods are constructive and they allow to build new
families of polynomials (see for example the constructions in subsection 5.1) which
always satisfy the wanted requirements. Even though we can show the existence
of such d for these families of polynomials, the wrinkle is that the required d might
in principle be large (but in practice, if one follows our recipe, this seems to be
never the case). What remains to do to completely remove the heuristic is to give
an explicit logarithmic bound for d for a polynomial in our family.
1.1. Notation. For the entire paper p is a prime and q = pa for some positive
integer a. Let k := Fq be the finite field of order q. Let f ∈ k[X] \ k[X
p].
ON THE SELECTION OF POLYNOMIALS FOR THE DLP ALGORITHM 3
Let Mf be the splitting field of f − t over k(t), which is a separable extension
of k(t). Let k̃ be the field of constants of Mf i.e. the integral closure of k in
Mf . Let Af = Gal(Mf : k(t)) be the arithmetic monodromy group of f and
Gf = Gal(Mf : k̃(t)) E Af be the geometric monodromy group of f . Let Sn be
the symmetric group of degree n. Notice that if F1, F2 are subfields of a larger
field F , we denote by F1F2 the the compositum of F1 and F2. Let G be a group
acting on a set Y . For any y ∈ Y we denote by StG(y) the stabilizer of y in G.
2. Galois Theory over Function Fields
Definition 4. Let f ∈ Fq[X]. We say that f is d-universal for some positive
integer d if for any positive integer ℓ ≤ deg(f), there exists t0 in Fqd such that
f(X)− t0 has an irreducible factor of degree ℓ. We say that f is universal if it is
d-universal for some d.
Remark 5. In this notation, in [1] it is suggested that xq + x2 is 2-universal for
any odd q (see section Finding appropriate h0, h1 of [1]).
In what follows we will use notation and terminology of [9]. First, we need a
classical result from algebraic number theory.
Theorem 6. Let L : K be a finite separable extension of global function fields and
let M be its Galois closure with Galois group G. Let P be a place of K and Q be
the set of places of L lying over P . Let R be a place of M lying over P . There is a
natural bijection between Q and the set of orbits of H = HomK(L : M) under the
action of the decomposition group D(R|P ) = {g ∈ G | g(R) = R}. In addition, let
Q ∈ Q and let HQ be the orbit corresponding to Q. Then |HQ| = e(Q|P )f(Q|P )
where e(Q|P ) and f(Q|P ) are ramification index and relative degree respectively.
A proof of Theorem 6 can be found for example in [4]. For a finite Galois
extension of function fields M : K with Galois group G, let P be a a degree 1
place of K and R be a place of M lying over P . Let φ be the topological generator
of Gal(k : k) defined by y 7→ yq. Let kR be the residue field at R and let φR be the
image of φ in Gal(kR : k). If (R,M : K) is the set of elements in D(R|P ) mapping
to φR, we denote by (P,M : K) the set {gxg
−1 : g ∈ G,x ∈ (R,M : K)}.
In what follows we will also need this special version of Chebotarev density
theorem, which can easily be adapted from [6] or [8].
Theorem 7 (Chebotarev Density Theorem). Let M : K be a finite Galois exten-
sion of function fields over a finite field k of cardinality q. Let G = Gal(M : K)
4 GIACOMO MICHELI
and assume that the field of constants of M is exactly k. Let Γ be a conjugacy
class of G and let SK be the set of places in K which are unramified in M . Then
we have
|{P ∈ SK |degk(P ) = 1, (P,M : K) = Γ}| =
|Γ|
|G|

.
The following easy lemma simplifies some of the proofs of the results in this
paper.
Lemma 8. Let f be a separable polynomial, let k′ be an extension of k, and
k̃′ := k′ ∩ k̃. Then
Gal(k′Mf : k
′(t)) ∼= Gal(Mf : k̃
′(t)).
Proof. First we observe that if F1 = Mf and F2 = k
′(t), then F1 ∩ F2 = k̃
′(t). In
addition, we know the Galois group of the compositum:
Gal(F1F2 : F1 ∩ F2) = Gal(k
′Mf : k̃
′(t)) ∼= Gal(Mf : k̃
′(t))×Gal(k′(t) : k̃′(t))
where the isomorphism is defined by the restriction map to Mf and k
′(t). It
follows easily that
Gal(k′Mf : k
′(t)) ∼= Gal(Mf : k̃
′(t)).

2.1. Short Group Theory Interlude.
Definition 9. Let X be a finite set and G be a finite group. An action of G on
X is said to be non-primitive if there exists an integer ℓ ∈ {2, . . . , |G| − 1} and
partition of X into X1, . . . Xℓ such that for any i ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ} we have g(Xi) = Xig
for some ig ∈ {1, . . . , ℓ}. An action is said to be primitive if is not non-primitive.
Roughly, the above definition states that an action of a group G on a set X is
primitive if it does not preserves any non-trivial partition of X. We will also need
the following group theory lemma, of which we include the proof for completeness.
Lemma 10. Let G be a subgroup of Sn acting on U = {1, . . . , n}. Suppose that
G acts transitively on U and it contains a cycle of prime order r with r > n/2.
Then G acts primitively on U .
Proof. Let X1⊔X2⊔· · ·⊔Xℓ be a system of imprimitivity i.e. this is the partition
induced by a non trivial equivalence relation ∼ which is G-invariant (i.e. x ∼ y
implies gx ∼ gy). Since G acts transitively, we recall that |Xi| = |X1| for all
ON THE SELECTION OF POLYNOMIALS FOR THE DLP ALGORITHM 5
i ∈ {1, . . . ℓ}. We argue by contradiction, by assuming 1 < |X1| < n. Consider
now the cycle σ of order r and take Xj which intersects the support of σ (i.e. σ
acts non trivially on Xj). Consider the orbit of Xj via σ:
Xj , σ(Xj), . . . , σ
v−1(Xj), σ
v(Xj) = Xj .
As r > n/2 and |Xj | > 1, this forces v < r, which implies gcd(v, r) = 1 as r is
prime. We have then that if v > 1
Xj = σ
r(Xj) = σ
r mod v(Xj) 6= Xj .
So we can assume v = 1. Now since σ is a cycle of prime order strictly greater
than n/2, and σ(Xj) = Xj , then |Xj | > n/2, which is a contradiction as all the
Xi have the same cardinality dividing n. 
3. A characterization of universal polynomials
We are now ready to prove the main result.
Theorem 11. Let f ∈ Fq[X]. Suppose that n = deg(f) ≥ 8, then f is universal
if and only if Af = Gf = Sn.
Proof. First, let us assume that f is d-universal for some positive integer d. Con-
sider first
A′f = Gal(FqdMf : Fqd(t)) ≤ Sn.
Let x be any zero of f(X) − t over Fq(t). From now on, we will look at A
′
f as a
subgroup of the permutation group of the roots of f(X) − t (or equivalently of
the set H = HomF
qd
(t)(Fqd(x),FqdMf )). Our first purpose is indeed to show that
A′f = Sn.
Let r be a prime in {⌊n2 ⌋+1, . . . , n− 3}. Such prime always exists by Bertrand
Postulate (also known as Chebyshev’s Theorem). Fix now t0 ∈ Fqd in such a
way that f(X) − t0 has an irreducible factor h(X) of degree r (over Fqd [X]).
This implies immediately that the ramification at t0 is one, as h(X)
e would have
degree larger than n for any e > 1. We claim that there exists γ ∈ A′f which
is a cycle of order r. Let P be the place corresponding to t0, Q be the place
of Fqd(x) corresponding to the irreducible factor of degree r lying over P , and
R be a place of FqdMf lying over Q. Let g ∈ D(R|P ) be such that its image
in Gal(OR/R : OP /P ) under the natural reduction modulo R is the Frobenius
automorphism. The order of g is then divisible by r, since an orbit of g acting
on H has size r (by the natural correspondance given by by Theorem 6). As r
6 GIACOMO MICHELI
is prime, the only chance is that g has a cycle of order r in its decomposition in
disjoint cycles. Now, as r > n/2, a certain power of g will be a cycle of order r:
this is our element γ.
Let us now summarize the properties of A′f given by the d-universality:
(1) It contains a cycle of order n/2 < r < n− 2 (by the previous argument).
(2) Since f(X)− t1 is irreducible for some t1, we get that A
′
f contains a cycle
of order n by a direct application of Theorem 6.
(3) Analogously, it contains a cycle of order n− 1.
(1)+Lemma 10 implies that A′f is primitive, therefore, (1)+(2) implies that
A′f contains the alternating group thanks to a theorem of Jordan [11, Theorem
13.9]. Then (2)+(3) implies that A′f is not the alternating group. It follows that
A′f = Sn. Let us now show that Af = A
′
f . Recall that k̃ is the constant field of
Mf . Let k
′ = Fqd and k̃
′ = k̃ ∩ k′. By Lemma 8
Sn = A
′
f = Gal(k
′Mf : k
′(t)) = Gal(Mf : k̃
′(t)).
Now, by observing Gal(Mf : k̃
′(t)) ≤ Gal(Mf : Fq(t)) = Af ≤ Sn we conclude
A′f = Af . We have now to show that the field of constants of Mf is indeed Fq.
The only other possibility is that the field of constants is k̃ = Fq2 as for n ≥ 5,
Sn has no normal subgroups other than the alternating group An. The reader
should notice that if d is even then k̃′ = k̃ = Fq2 , therefore we are done by the
fact that Gf = Gal(Mf : k̃
′(t)) = Gal(Mf : k̃(t)) = Sn. Thus, we restrict to the
case d odd. Let us argue by contradiction by supposing k′k̃ = Fq2d . Suppose that
n = deg(f) is odd, and let t1 ∈ Fqd for which f(x) − t1 is irreducible of degree
n. Let us denote by P1 the place corresponding to t1 in Fqd(t), Q ⊂ Fq2d(x)
be the place over P1 corresponding to the irreducible polynomial f(x) − t1, and
R a place of FqdMf lying over Q. Since Q is unique and unramified, then R is
unramified. Therefore, D(R|P1) is cyclic and it has exactly one orbit of order n
corresponding to Q under the bijection given by Theorem 6. It follows that any
generator of D(R|P1) is a cycle of order n, so D(R|P1) has order n. On the other
hand, the order of D(R|P1) is also f(R|P1), which is divisible by [Fq2d : Fqd ] = 2
thus we have a contradiction. If n is even, then take t2 for which f(x) − t2 has
an irreducible factor h(X) of degree n − 1 (and therefore also a factor of degree
1). Let P2 be the place corresponding to t2 and Q1, Q2 be the places of Fq2d(x)
corresponding respectively to h(X) and to the factor of degree one of f(x) − t2.
Let R be a place of FqdMf lying over P2. Since Q1 and Q2 are the unique places of
Fq2d(x) lying over P2 and they are both unramified, then any place R lying above
ON THE SELECTION OF POLYNOMIALS FOR THE DLP ALGORITHM 7
P2 is unramified. Arguing similarly as before, we get that D(R|P2) is cyclic and
it has a cycle of order n−1, therefore f(R|P2) = |D(R|P2)| = n−1. On the other
hand, since the size of the decomposition group is divided by [Fq2d : Fqd ] = 2, we
get the contradiction we wanted.
This shows that the constant field of FqdMf is Fqd . On the other hand, the
field of constant of FqdMf is k̃Fqd: as d is odd, this forces k̃ = Fq (as the only
other chance was k′ = Fq2d).
Let us prove the other implication. Suppose that Gf = Af = Sn and fix
ℓ ∈ {1, . . . , n}. Let now γ be a cycle of Gf of order ℓ and let Γ be its conjugacy
class. In the notation of Theorem 7, for any d ∈ N we have that
|{P ∈ SF
qd
(t)|degF
qd
(P ) = 1, (P,M : K) = Γ}| =
|Γ|
|Gf |
qd +O
(
qd/2
)
,
where the implied constant is independent of d and q. This shows immediately
that, when d is large enough, there is an unramified place P of degree 1 in Fqd(t)
(corresponding to an element t0 ∈ Fqd) for which γ is the Frobenius (for some
place of FqdMf lying over P ). As γ is a cycle of order ℓ, by applying Theorem 6
we get that f(X)− t0 has a factor of degree ℓ in Fqd [X]. 
Corollary 12. Suppose that f is d-universal for some d, then there exists d0 for
which f is d-universal for every d > d0.
Proof. Suppose that f is d-universal, then Gf = Af = Sn. By the same argument
as in the proof the second implication of Theorem 11, it follows that when d is
large enough the number of t0 ∈ Fqd for which f(x) has an irreducible factor of
degree ℓ can be estimated with |Γ||Gf |q
d for Γ the conjugacy class of an element
having a cycle of order ℓ in its decomposition in disjoint cycles (one can actually
directly select an element which ”is” a cycle of order ℓ). 
Corollary 13. A universal polynomial f of degree greater than or equal to 8 is
indecomposable, i.e. it cannot be written as composition of lower degree polyno-
mials
Proof. By Theorem 11, it is enough to observe that Sn acts primitively on the
roots of f . This forces the polynomial to be indecomposable (see for example [7,
Section 2.3]). 
The statement of Theorem 3 now follows with the choice h1 = 1 and h2 = x
2.
8 GIACOMO MICHELI
4. Universality for Xq +X2 − t
In this section, let us specialize to the polynomial f = Xq + X2, as this is
the one suggested for the function field sieve [1] and experimentally is believed to
be 2-universal, see last paragraph in [1, Section 5]. Let us recall a result due to
Turnwald [10].
Theorem 14. Let k be a field of characteristic different from 2 and g ∈ k[X].
Suppose that the derivative g′ of g has at least a simple root and for any pair
of roots α, β of g′ over k we have that g(α) 6= g(β). In addition suppose that
char(k) ∤ deg(g). Then the Galois Group of g − t over k(t) is Sdeg(g).
With this tool in hand, we are able to compute the arithmetic and the geometric
monodromy group of Xq +X2.
Proposition 15. Let char(Fq) 6= 2 and f = X
q+X2 ∈ Fq[X]. The Galois Group
Af of f − t ∈ Fq(t)[X] over Fq(t) is Sq. Moreover Gf = Af .
Proof. Clearly, Theorem 14 does not apply to the polynomial above as its degree
is divisible by the characteristic of the field. Let us consider the extension Fq(x) :
Fq(t) where x is a root of f − t, and then verifies f(x) = x
q + x2 = t. Let
{y1, . . . , yq−1} be the set of roots of X
q−1 + X + 2x ∈ Fq(x)[X]. They are all
distinct, as the polynomial is separable. It is easy to see that x + yi is a root of
f − t for any i ∈ {0, . . . q − 1}. Therefore, the splitting field Mf of f − t over
Fq(t) is exactly Fq(x, y1, . . . , yq−1). Let us now consider B = Gal(Mf : Fq(x))
which is a subgroup of Af = Gal(Mf : Fq(t)). The Galois Group B is the same as
the Galois group of the polynomial X
q−1+X
−2 − x over Fq(x), for which Turnwald
theorem applies with base field Fq(x) since
• char(Fq) 6= 2
• The roots of Xq−2 − 1 are ξi for ξ a primitive (q − 2)-root of unity and
i ∈ {0, . . . , q − 3}.
• ξ
i(q−1)+ξi
−2 =
ξj(q−1)+ξj
−2 implies ξ
i = ξj but then i = j.
We are now sure that the Galois Group of X
q−1+X
−2 −x is B = Sq−1. Observe that
B ≤ Af and Af acts transitively on the set of roots {x, x+y1, x+y2, . . . , x+yq−1}
and the stabilizer of x contains B. By the orbit-stabilizer theorem we have that
q =
|Af |
|StAf (x)|
≤
|Af |
|B|
=
|Af |
(q − 1)!
ON THE SELECTION OF POLYNOMIALS FOR THE DLP ALGORITHM 9
Therefore |Af | ≥ q! but also |Af | ≤ q! as Af is a subgroup of Sq, so Af = Sq. We
have now to show that Gf = Af . Suppose that the constant field of Mf is k̃ and
notice that all the arguments above apply again by replacing Fq with k̃. Hence
this immediately shows Gf = Sn. 
Corollary 16. There exists d0 ∈ N such that X
q + X2 is d-universal for any
d > d0.
Proof. By individually checking the cases q < 8 we can assume q ≥ 8. By the
previous result we have that Theorem 11 applies, therefore it also applies Corollary
12, which is exactly the claim. 
The reader should notice now that the first occurence of d1 for which X
q +X2
is d1 universal miche be strictly less than d0. What would be ideal to show, is
that d0 is indeed “small” enough (conjecturally it is 2), on the other hand the
above corollary at least shows that such d exists.
5. Constructing d-universal polynomials in odd characteristic
The combination of Theorem 14 and Theorem 11 gives a deterministic easy
way to construct polynomials which are likely to build up any extension between
the base field and the degree of the polynomial satisfying Conjecture 2. We give
a class of examples in the next subsection. For the rest of this section, q will be
an odd prime power.
5.1. Universality for Xq+j − jX. In this subsection we show a large class of
polynomials which can be shown to be universal. In addition such polynomials
appear to be always d-universal for a small d.
Proposition 17. Let q be an odd prime power and Fp be its prime subfield. Let
j ∈ N \ {0, 1, pk}k∈N. The polynomial f = X
q+j − jX ∈ Fq[X] is universal.
Proof. We would like to verify the conditions of Theorem 14 for the geometric
monodromy group of f , then it will follow that also the arithmetic monodromy
group of f is the symmetric group, for which Theorem 11 now applies, showing
the universality of f .
The derivative of f is f ′ = jXq+j−1 − j. Since j is different from 1, then f ′
has all single roots in Fq. Now, any root of f has the form ξ
i, where ξ is a fixed
primitive q + j − 1 root of unity, and u is an integer in {0, . . . , q + j − 2}.
It is now enough to observe that f(ξu) = ξu−jξu = (1−j)ξu 6= (1−j)ξv = f(ξv)
for u 6= v mod q + j − 1.
10 GIACOMO MICHELI
The conditions of Theorem 14 are now verified and then Theorem 11 applies,
leading to the claim. 
Remark 18. The experiments show that this class of polynomials actually verifies
a stronger property, i.e. each of them seems to be d-universal for d = j + 1. In
particular, for j = 2, the polynomial Xq+2 − 2X is 3-universal for any prime q
less than1 401 therefore building up suitable extensions of size up to 401401.
