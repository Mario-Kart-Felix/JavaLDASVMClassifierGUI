and may even appear legitimate and even supposedly 
from people you may know.  
  They all have this in common:  they are designed to get 
you to click on an item like an attachment, link or picture.

Why Should I Care.. Cont’d 
  Broken device 
  Devices that do not work when needed or  
    as expected. 
 
  Privacy and personal security concerns 
•  Preventing private, 
personal, or sensitive 
information  from being 
disclosed

from your computer 
 Must be kept up to date 
  Install security patches 
 Enable Firewalls 
  Protects computers by preventing 
unauthorized access 
Basic Approaches to Security 
10/17/2013 Computer and Internet Security 
  Use strong passwords to protect computers 
  Be cautious about downloading free software or files 
from untrusted sites 
Basic Approaches to Security 
  Most prevalent threats to your security 
come to you in your Inbox; are all designed 
to get you to click on an item like an 
attachment, link or picture.

  Think before you click on links 
  Most threats are targeted in hopes that you will click on a 
harmful link, attachment, picture, video or icon in an email or 
web page 
  Stop: Do not automatically click on Internet links until you 
have confidence in them. 
  Think: Look at the actual address for the links in question. 
For instance if the link indicates “Click Here” be sure to 
hover your mouse pointer over the link and investigate 
before you proceed. 
  Click: Only after you are confident that the 
    site is safe.

Mobile Devices - Risks 
  Mobile devices are easy to lose or steal 
  Can carry large amount of data 
  If stolen, an unsecured Smartphone grants access 
to your private information: email correspondence, 
address books, and any unsecured documents.  
  Often unprotected 
  Data may be “sniffed” during unprotected    
wireless communications

Mobile Devices - Risks 
  Location Sharing  
  Location-aware applications 
deliver online content to users 
based on their physical 
location.  
  Technologies employ GPS, 
cell phone infrastructure or 
wireless access points to 
identify where cell phones or 
laptops are located and users 
can share that information 
with location-aware 
applications.

Mobile Devices - How are Location 
Sharing Technologies used?

information on nearby 
restaurants, notify you of 
traffic jams, or let your 
friends in a social network 
know where you are, 
prompting increased social 
connectivity.
