Protecting Yourself
1.  Use Strong Passwords
 Keep you passwords 
private and create ones 
that are hard to “crack”
 Never share your 
passwords with friends or 
be tricked into giving them 
away
Creating Strong, Memorable Passwords
1. Think of a sentence you can remember
“My son Aiden is three years old.”
2. Does the system allow passphrases?
3. Convert phrase to password
“msaityo”
4. Add complexity
“My SoNAyd3N is 3 yeeRs old”
“MsAy3yo”
5. Substitute some special characters
“MySoN 8N i$ 3 yeeR$ old”
“M$8ni3y0”
Password Strategies to Avoid
 Avoid sequences or repeated characters
“12345678”, “222222”, “abcdefg”, “asdfjkl;”
 Avoid using only look-alike substitutions of numbers or 
symbols
“M1cr0$0ft”, “P@ssw0rd”
 Do not use your login name
 Avoid dictionary words in any language
 Avoid using the same password everywhere
 Sticky notes under the keyboard (or elsewhere)
Protect Your Passwords
 Do not reveal to others
 Protect any recorded 
passwords
 NEVER provide your 
password over e-mail or 
based on an e-mail 
Change your passwords at 
least once a semester
request
 Do not type passwords on 
computers that you do 
not control (trust)
 Only enter passwords into 
secure sites
2.  Understand Email is NOT Secure
 Without the use of 
encryption, email can be 
intercepted and read 
without your consent
 Do not trust that an email 
came from the person in 
 Be wary of attachments 
received by email – they 
can contain viruses
 Word, Excel, PDF, picture 
and music files can contain 
viruses!
the “From” field  An attachment from 
someone you know can 
contain a virus
3.  Recognize Phishing Attempts
 Mass email sent claiming to be from reputable
or trusted organization
 May include links to a fake website
 May ask you to reply with your username and 
password
 May ask for other personal information (credit card, social 
security, mother’s maiden name, etc)
 Some are poorly written
 Generally do not make sense (out of context)
 Mail may originate from or reply to free email services (Yahoo, 
Gmail, Hotmail, etc)
.
Bowdoin will NEVER request your password be 
sent by email
 Stop:  Do not react to phishing ploys consisting of 
“upsetting” or “exciting” information
 Look:  Look closely at the claims in the email, and 
carefully review all links and web addresses
Call
Phishing – Use “Stop-Look-Call”
 :  Do not reply to e-mails requesting you to confirm 
account information; call or email the company in 
question to verify if the email is legitimate
Never email or instant message personal information
4.  Use Secure Websites
 Look for:
 “https://”
 Yellow lock in location or status bars
 Blue or green location bar

information or 
passwords into 
unsecure websites
Internet Explorer Examples

Numbers, driver’s license numbers or other personal 
identity information unless you know exactly who is 
receiving it
 Never send personal or confidential information via email 
or instant message
 Do not fall for phishing scams

Protecting Your 
Computer
6.  Use Anti-virus Software
 Anti-virus software can 
detect and destroy 
computer viruses before 
they cause damage
 Just like a flu shot, for anti-
virus software to be 
effective, you must keep it 
up to date
 AVG
Sophos is available to Bowdoin 
students and employees for free
7.  Use Anti-spyware Software
 Use anti-spyware software 
so unknown people 
cannot lurk on your 
computer and potentially 
steal your information
 Many anti-virus products 
include this feature 
(Sophos does)
 Spybot, Ad-Aware
“Free” software often contains hidden 
spyware – read user agreements carefully
8.  Keep Your Computer Updated
 Install all security updates 
as soon as they are 
available
 Automatic updates 
provide the best 
protection
 Be sure to restart your 
computer after installing 
updates
9.  Use a Firewall
 An Internet firewall is like 
a moat around a castle, 
creating a barrier between 
your computer and the 
Internet
 Most popular operating 
systems have one built in 
– Check to make sure it is 
on
10.  Backup Your Important Files
 Reduce your risk of losing 
important files to a virus, 
computer crash, theft or 
disaster by creating 
backup copies
 Save copies of your 
important documents and 
files to a CD, DVD, flash 
or USB drive, or online 
backup services
 Test your backups
Keep your critical files 
in one place on your 
computer’s hard drive 
so you can easily 
create a backup
