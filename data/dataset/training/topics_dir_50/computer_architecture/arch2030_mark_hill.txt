Our Task: Telling a “New” Story
• Was 21st Century Computer Architecture NEW? 
o No 
o Resulted in more $50M in funding in USA 
• Why? 
o New to others 
o Told a story that mattered to others 
• Develop a New-to-Others Message as a Story 
o Why Important to Others? 
o Why Now? 
o How Might Research Make a Difference? 
• This is our task now – not developing ideas new to us

20th Century ICT Set Up
• Information & Communication Technology (ICT) 
Has Changed Our World 
o <long list omitted> 
• Required innovations in algorithms, applications, 
programming languages, … , & system software 
• Key (invisible) enablers (cost-)performance gains 
o Semiconductor technology (“Moore’s Law”) 
o Computer architecture (~80x per Danowitz et al.)

Moore’s Law —  
2× transistors/chip
Transistor count still 2× BUT…
Dennard Scaling —
~constant power/chip
Gone. Can’t repeatedly double 
power/chip

Technology’s Challenges 2/2
Late 20th Century The New Reality
Moore’s Law —  
2× transistors/chip
Transistor count still 2× BUT…
Dennard Scaling —
~constant power/chip
Gone. Can’t repeatedly double 
power/chip
Modest (hidden) 
transistor unreliability
Increasing transistor unreliability 
can’t be hidden
Focus on computation 
over communication  
Communication (energy) more 
expensive than computation
1-time costs amortized 
via mass market
One-time cost much worse & 
want specialized platforms

How should architects step up as technology falters?

Architecture as Infrastructure:  
Spanning sensors to clouds

● Parallelism 
● Specialization 
● Cross-layer design

CMOS, DRAM,

New technologies (non-volatile 
memory, near-threshold, 3D, 
photonics, …) Rethink: memory & 
storage, reliability, communication

What Research Exactly?
• Research areas in white paper (& backup slides) 
1. Architecture as Infrastructure: Spanning Sensors to Clouds 
2. Energy First 
3. Technology Impacts on Architecture 
4. Cross-Cutting Issues & Interfaces 
• Much more research developed by future PIs!
17
Pre-Competitive Research Justified
• Retain (cost-)performance enabler to ICT revolution 
• Successful companies cannot do this by themselves 
o Lack needed long-term focus 
o Don’t want to pay for what benefits all 
o Resist transcending interfaces that define their products 
• Corroborates  
o Future of Computing Performance: Game Over or Next

White Paper Process
• Late March 2012 
o CCC contacts coordinator & forms group 
• April 2012 
o Brainstorm (meetings/online doc) 
o Read related docs (PCAST, NRC Game Over, ACAR1/2, …) 
o Use online doc for intro & outline then parallel sections 
o Rotated authors to revise sections 
• May 2012 
o Brainstorm list of researcher in/out of comp. architecture 
o Solicit researcher feedback/endorsement 
o Do distributed revision & redo of intro 
o Release May 25 to CCC & via email 
• Later  
o CCC & NSF Outbriefs 
o HPCA/PPoPP/CGO/ICS Keynotes 
o ASPLOS & ISCA-Workshop Panels
