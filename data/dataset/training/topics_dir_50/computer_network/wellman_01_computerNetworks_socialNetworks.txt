Computer Networks As Social Networks
Barry Wellman
Computer networks are inherently social networks, linking people, orga-
nizations, and knowledge. They are social institutions that should not be
studied in isolation but as integrated into everyday lives. The proliferation
of computer networks has facilitated a deemphasis on group solidarities at
work and in the community and afforded a turn to networked societies
that are loosely bounded and sparsely knit. The Internet increases people’s
social capital, increasing contact with friends and relatives who live nearby
and far away. New tools must be developed to help people navigate and
find knowledge in complex, fragmented, networked societies.
Once upon a time, computers were not
social beings. Most stood alone, be they
mainframe, mini, or personal computer.
Each person who used a computer sat alone
in front of a keyboard and screen. To help
people deal with their computers, the field
of human-computer interaction (HCI) de-
veloped, providing such things as more
accessible interfaces and user-friendly soft-
ware. But as the HCI name says, the model
was person-computer.
Computers have increasingly reached out
to each other. Starting in the 1960s, people
began piggybacking on machine-machine
data transfers to send each other messages.
Communication soon spilled over organiza-
tional boundaries. The proliferation of elec-
tronic mail (e-mail) in the 1980s and its
expansion into the Internet in the 1990s
(based on e-mail and the Web) have so tied
things together that to many, being at a com-
puter is synonymous with being connected to
the Internet.
As a result, HCI has become socialized.
Much of the discussion at current HCI con-
ferences is about how people use computers
to relate to each other (1). Some participants
build “groupware” to support such interac-
tions; others do ethnographic, laboratory, and
survey studies to ascertain how people actu-
ally relate to each other. This work has slowly
moved from the lone computer user to deal-
ing with (i) how two people relate to each
other online, (ii) how small groups interact,
and (iii) how large unbounded systems oper-
ate—the ultimate being the worldwide Inter-
net, the largest and most fully connected so-
cial network of them all. Just one small por-
tion of the Internet—Usenet members—par-
ticipated in more than 80,000 topic-oriented
collective discussion groups in 2000. 8.1 mil-
lion unique participants posted 151 million
messages (2–4). This is more than three times
the number identified on 27 January 1996 (5)
Computer scientists and developers have
come to realize that when computer systems
connect people and organizations, they are
inherently social. They are also coming to
realize that the popular term “groupware” is
misleading, because computer networks prin-
cipally support social networks, not groups.
A group is only one special type of a social
network; one that is heavily interconnected
and clearly bounded. Much social organiza-
tion no longer fits the group model. Work,
community, and domestic life have largely
moved from hierarchically arranged, densely
knit, bounded groups to social networks.
In networked societies, boundaries are
more permeable, interactions are with diverse
others, linkages switch between multiple net-
works, and hierarchies are flatter and more
recursive (6–8). Hence, many people and or-
ganizations communicate with others in ways
that ramify across group boundaries. Rather
than relating to one group, they cycle through
interactions with a variety of others, at work
or in the community. Their work and com-
munity networks are diffuse and sparsely
knit, with vague overlapping social and spa-
tial boundaries. Their computer-mediated
communication has become part of their ev-
eryday lives, rather than being a separate set
of relationships.
When computer-mediated communication
networks link people, institutions, and knowl-
edge, they are computer-supported social net-
works. Indeed, if Novell had not gotten there
first, computer scientists would be saying
“netware” instead of “groupware” for sys-
tems that enable people to interact with each
other online. Often computer networks and
social networks work conjointly, with com-
puter networks linking people in social net-
works and with people bringing their offline
situations to bear when they use computer
networks to interact.
The intersection of computer networks
with the emerging networked society has fos-
tered several exciting developments. I report
here on two developing areas: (i) community
networks on- and offline and (ii) knowledge
access.
Community Networks On- and Offline
Community, like computers, has become net-
worked. Although community was once syn-
onymous with densely knit, bounded neigh-
borhood groups, it is now seen as a less
bounded social network of relationships that
provide sociability support, information, and
a sense of belonging. These communities are
partial (people cycle through interactions
with multiple sets of others) and ramify
through space [a low proportion of commu-
nity members in the developed world are
neighbors (7)]. Where once people interacted
door-to-door in villages (subject to public
support and social control), they now interact
household-to-household and person-to-per-
son (9).
Although the support of collaborative
work was the initial purpose of the Internet
(both e-mail and the Web), it is an excellent
medium for supporting far-flung, intermit-
tent, networked communities. E-mail tran-
scends physical propinquity and mutual
availability; e-mail lists enable broadcasts to
multiple community members; attachments
and Web sites allow documents, pictures, and
videos to be passed along; buddy lists and
other awareness tools show who might be
available for communication at any one time;
and instant messaging means that simulta-
neous communication can happen online as
well as face-to-face and by telephone.
Systematic research on what people ac-
tually do on the Internet has lagged behind
the Internet’s development. After a long

C O M P U T E R S A N D S C I E N C E
period of pundit supposition, travelers’ tales,
and laboratory studies of computer-mediated
communication, survey-based and ethnograph-
ic research is now appearing.
These studies address a vigorous public
debate about whether people can find com-
munity online. Critics wonder whether rela-
tionships between people who never see,
smell, or hear each other can be the basis for
true community [reviewed in (10); examples
include (11–13)]. Other detractors make an
opposite argument: The Internet may be so
immersive that it lures people away from
other pursuits (14) and involves them in on-
line interactions that only reinforce their ex-
isting opinions.
By contrast, enthusiasts see the Internet
as extending and transforming community.
John Perry Barlow asserts that “with the
development of the Internet . . . we are in
the middle of the most transforming tech-
nological event since the capture of fire”
(15). They point to the ability of the Inter-
net to span distances and time zones at low
cost, to sustain relationships based on
shared interests (even when the participants
are residentially dispersed), and to provide
powerful links between people and dis-
persed knowledge (16).
Too often the debate has been (i)
Manichean: The Internet is bringing heaven
or hell, but nothing in between. (ii) Unidi-
mensional: The Internet is such a powerful
force that other considerations, such as gen-
der and status in an organization, are ignored.
(iii) Parochial: The Internet should be consid-
ered as an entity in itself, rather than as fitting
into the full range of work, community, and
daily life. (iv) Presentist: The Internet is such
a transforming force that long-term social
trends, such as the pre-Internet move to net-
worked communities, are irrelevant.
As the debate continues, the Internet is
now used by a majority of North Ameri-
cans, although its growth rate is slowing
and may stabilize at about 60% of adults.
The digital divide is decreasing rapidly in
North America, although socioeconomic
status (education, occupation, and income)
remains an important differentiator (17–
20). The digital divide is much more sig-
nificant in two ways in less developed
countries: (i) A much lower percentage of
the population use the Internet and (ii) the
users are predominantly well-connected
elites (21). In the developed world, the
amount of time spent online is increasing,
per capita as well as overall. For example,
the average AOL user spent 31 min per day
online in the first quarter of 1997; in 4
years, this had more than doubled to 64 min
online in the first quarter of 2001 (22). Nor
does familiarity breed interpersonal con-
tempt: The more contact people have on-
line, the greater the impression they make
on each other (23).
Survey-based evidence about the Inter-
net’s effect on community has been mixed.
Most cross-sectional studies show that those
frequently online are more involved in com-
munity (24–27). By contrast, one study (28)
suggests that extensive online involvement
took people away from interaction with
household and community members. More-
over, the only true longitudinal study found
that some “newbies” became more depressed,
alienated, and isolated during the first 6
months of computer use (29).
Robust results indicating how the Internet
fits into community life are now available
(30–32). It is becoming clear that the Internet
is not destroying community but is resonating
with and extending the types of networked
community that have already become preva-
lent in the developed Western world. Old ties
with relatives and former neighbors are main-
tained; new ties are developed among people
sharing interests. It is not only that time and
space become less important in computer-
mediated communication, but that it is easy
to communicate with large groups of commu-
nity members (using lists) and to bring un-
connected community members into direct
contact. The ease with which computer-me-
diated communication connects friends of
friends can also increase the density of inter-
connections among clusters of network mem-
bers within communities.
For one thing, as the newbies studied by
Kraut et al. (33) gained more experience with
the Internet, their depression and alienation
disappeared, and their social contact in-
creased enough to have a positive impact on
their overall interactions with community
members. A comparative analysis found that
social support obtained online helped people
to deal with depression (34).
Other studies have found that the Internet
increased community interaction (35, 36).
For example, a large National Geographic
Web survey found that face-to-face visits and
phone calls were neither more numerous nor
fewer for people who use e-mail a great deal.
E-mail just added to the fund of contact, so
that the overall volume of contacts with
friends and relatives through all media was
higher for people who use e-mail a lot (27)
(Table 1).
However, another study found that e-mail
use is displacing telephone use to some extent
(37). Perhaps there are differences in the
kinds of communication that take place on
the Internet or by telephone or face-to-face.
Although one study of a dispersed work
group found much similarity in what was said
by means of each of these media (26), anoth-
er found that among community members,
e-mail is preferred more when people want to
garner information efficiently.

The positive impact of the Internet on
community ties is true for those living both
nearby and far away. The proportionate gain
in contact is greatest for contact with friends
and relatives living at a distance (9, 38), as
one might expect from a system able to cross
time zones at a single bound and in which
there is no differentiation between short-dis-
tance and long-distance messages. Yet online
as well as offline contact is highest with those
living nearby (9, 38). Cyberspace does not
vanquish the importance of physical space.
For example, many e-mail and chat messages
arrange face-to-face meetings (26, 39).
The recent case of “Netville” (a suburb of
Toronto) is especially interesting, because
here neighborhood access to a high-speed
Internet service helped bring neighborhood
members together for face-to-face get-togeth-
ers, from visits in private homes to semi-
public barbeques (40, 41). Those who were
part of the high-speed service knew three
times as many neighbors as the unwired and
visited with 1.6 times as many. Nor was the
Internet only used socially: Netville residents
used their local discussion list to mobilize
against the real estate developer and the local
Internet service provider (40). To be sure,
Netville may be a special case because the
residents were newly arrived and excited to
be part of an Internet experiment. Yet recent
work in Michigan (42) and Los Angeles (43)
shows how the Internet can reinforce tradi-
tional community development approaches.
Despite the past decade’s excitement
about the Internet, as it pervades life it may
become as taken for granted as that once-
transforming technology, the telephone (44).
One indication is that those who have been on
the Internet the longest and the most fre-
quently are least apt to feel that they are a part
of an online community, although their over-
all sense of community remains (27). This
may reflect their greater likelihood of en-
countering distasteful situations, such as
flaming, hacking into accounts, virus trans-
mission, or unwanted junk mail “spam.” Or it
may mean that those with much Internet ex-
perience do not privilege it as a special form
of community. Or it may support the fears of
those who believe that computer-mediated
communication is not a satisfactory surrogate
for face-to-face contact.
Thus, preliminary findings create new
questions. At present, Internet studies of
community are in full swing: The Pew Inter-
net and American Life project does a monthly
tracking study (35). The Stanford Institute for
the Quantitative Study of Society is doing
frequent surveys (14, 45). The U.S. General
Social Survey, which is central to social sci-
ence research, included an Internet module in
2000 and may do so again. The 2001 Cana-
dian General Social Survey has an Internet
module. The large-scale international Nation-
al Geographic Survey2000 data are available
for use [(27, 46); see http://survey2000.
nationalgeographic.com]. The National Geo-
graphic Society (in conjunction with Clem-
son University and the University of Toronto)
is doing an even larger and more comprehen-
sive Web survey in fall 2001. A University of
Maryland “Web institute” is archiving many
surveys online with statistical software avail-
able for reanalysis (47). Along with such
survey efforts, there is scope for ethnographic
community studies [such as what Hampton
and Wellman have done in Netville (38, 40,
47–49)].
Finding Knowledge in a Networked
Society
Many organizations are similar to networked
communities in having multiple sets of work
team members (including multiple superiors),
physically dispersed relationships, and teams
of co-workers shifting by the day and week as
employees get involved in multiple projects.
The situation is different from that dealt with
by traditional organizational theory, which
comprehends densely knit workgroups neatly
structured in bureaucratic, hierarchical orga-
nizational trees (6, 50–52).
How do people work together in large,
sprawling, networked organizations where
they are simultaneously members of multiple,
transitory, physically dispersed teams? In
particular, how do people in such organiza-
tions obtain knowledge from others when
they do not know whom to ask?
These questions are of immediate practi-
cal importance for complex organizations.
Hence, computer-supported solutions are de-
veloping for working through trusted inter-
personal relationships to identify, locate, and
receive information within and between com-
munities and organizations. It is not surpris-
ing that work in this area has been driven by
computer scientists and communication sci-
entists interested in building tools for knowl-
edge access and management.
One issue is finding out who knows what;
a more complex task in networked organiza-
tions (53). Normally, one attempts to exam-
ine the documentation or other help sources
and then wanders out into a hallway in search
of friendly colleagues. The problem becomes
acute, however, in distributed communities
[(54), p. 97].
How do people wander the hallway when
their team or other supports are physically
distributed? One approach is to build aware-
ness tools (55). Two of these, Cruiser (56)
and Postcards/Telepresence (57, 58), provid-
ed low-resolution video pictures of offices or
cubicles. The picture told others whether peo-
ple were in their offices and perhaps avail-
able. The low resolution of the picture was
not able to show what people were doing and
afforded some privacy.
Another approach, Babble, builds on the
traditional groupware approach, which facil-
itates a small defined group working together
(59). Babble shows each person as an animat-
ed and colored circle that moves closer to the
center as the person gets more involved in
team activities.
When people are asked about the size of
their networks, they consistently report them
as smaller than the 1000 or more others that
they probably know well enough to converse
with (60–62). Rolodexes and their database
equivalents are some help, but the listing can
be computer-supported. ContactMap (52)
looks at ongoing Internet exchanges to record
a person’s contacts.
Such memory aids typically record each
person as a discrete entity. New develop-
ments record the connections of network
members (63, 64). As such approaches de-
velop, they have the potential to do primitive
automated social network analysis—identify-
ing clusters, boundaries, centrality, bridges,
and blocks—by analyzing who jointly re-
ceives an e-mail and who forwards e-mails to
whom.
Who holds the organizational or commu-
nity memory, now that the veteran employ-
ee—the fount of work lore—is neither known
nor accessible? Often people ask their work-
mates. But what if they do not know? People
then wonder whether friends of friends know,
yet most people do not possess a list of all of
their friends’ friends, much less are aware of
what their friends’ friends know. Yet it is
reasonable to assume that the number of
friends of friends is 100,000, assuming that
each person knows approximately 1000 oth-
ers and that 10 percent of each person’s ties
are unique. These are too many names to
keep track of, yet people often want a per-
sonal touch when giving and getting informa-
tion. They may want to talk to the informa-
tion holder to supply a nuanced or confiden-
tial request; the information holder may only
be willing to release such information to a
friend or a friend of a friend.
IKNOW is software that stores informa-
tion about friends of friends; not only who
they are but what information they know
(65). It seeks to answer the question: “Who
knows who knows what?” The hope is that
through the use of such indirect but personal
ties, people will supply reliable and appropri-
ate information. Issues remain. The first is
about software that is scalable to map and
supply such contact information for a large
amorphous organization. The second is about
data collection: How do systems compile in-
formation about who knows what? The third
is about privacy: Do people want to reveal
their friends and their skill sets to strangers?
The Answer Garden (54) addresses such
issues of data collection and privacy, al-
though it does not deal with interpersonal
www.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 293 14 SEPTEMBER 2001 2033
C O M P U T E R S A N D S C I E N C E
connections. It provides tools for people to
build repositories of commonly requested
questions and answers, in part by building up
these repositories from ongoing question-
and-answer sessions. Thus, only the informa-
tion that has been publicly provided is avail-
able. However, this provides only limited
access to the files of each work team member.
Good solutions are not yet available that bal-
ance team needs to have access to personal
files with the needs of each person to limit a
team’s access to only the germane portions of
his or her entire files.
With so much potential and need to con-
nect, there is the need to prioritize communi-
cation. Does my boss supersede my peers?
Does my wife or husband have higher prior-
ity than my sister or brother? Dealing with
such matters would be an advanced imple-
mentation for the simple filter rules now
commonly available for e-mail. Important, as
yet unpublished, work is being done to estab-
lish rules for prioritizing computer-mediated
contact, both deductively setting a priori rules
and inductively watching which messages a
person takes first.
An Internet year is like a dog year,
changing approximately seven times faster
than normal human time. Nevertheless, I
expect the transition from a group-based to
a networked society to continue (66 ).
Although technology does not change
society—it only affords possibilities for
change—powerful forces are shaping the
Internet: increased broadband use, global
ubiquity, portability, 24/7 availability, per-
sonalization, and the switch from place-to-
place to person-to-person connectivity.
These suggest the accelerating need for
social network concepts and tools for en-
gaging with the Internet.

nal data from more than 20 surveys in which behav-
ioral questions about Internet usage were asked of
nationally representative samples, including the Dig-
ital Divide surveys done by the U.S. Census Bureau
for the NTIA, the 2000 U.S. General Social Survey,
and national time use surveys. Users can directly
analyze the data interactively using statistical soft-
ware. In addition to the data archive, the Web site
contains an annotated bibliography of behavioral re-
search into more than 15 areas of Internet use (such
as the digital divide, time displacement, and social
networks), articles on Internet behavior, and links to
other resources.
