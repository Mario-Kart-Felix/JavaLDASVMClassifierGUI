Unit 2–Computer Network Fundamentals 
Preface 
Over the past several years, home computer networks have become increasingly popular in the U.S. 
Home networks are used to share Internet access and other computing resources, support sophisticated 
home entertainment and security systems, and more. In response to ever-growing demand, the 
electronics industry has introduced a wide variety of consumer-grade networking components, which 
are inexpensive and easy to use.  
This unit the fundamental concepts of computer networking, using the TCP/IP model as a framework, 
with a focus on Ethernet and 802.11g. By the end of this unit, students will be conversant with the five 
layers of the TCP/IP model and the star topology. They will be able to build simple Ethernet networks, 
using hubs and switches and private IPv4 addresses; make their own patch cables; and troubleshoot 
connectivity problems. They will also be able to build wireless networks of a similar scale, using 
inexpensive 802.11g routers and adapters. Throughout this unit, students will use packet tracing 
exercises to help them visualize and apply the TCP/IP networking model to the networks they actually 
build. 
Concepts & Processes 
1. Computer networks allow users to share data and hardware. They also allow people from all 
over the world to communicate and collaborate in a variety of ways. 
2. The TCP/IP protocol suite drives the Internet and is very well supported by all modern 
computing systems. TCP/IP uses an easy-to-understand model to describe how network systems 
work and the ways in which the various protocol layers work together. 
3. A variety of Open Source software tools--including Linux, Ethereal, and many others--are 
available to support the study and understanding of networks. 
4. Using simple, affordable components, it is possible to build robust, secure wired and wireless 
networks to accomplish virtually any task for which a networking solution is appropriate. 
5. There exists a worldwide community of computing and networking enthusiasts, who are 
involved in literally thousands of projects to develop and share software and hardware solutions 
to a wide range of problems and opportunities.

Lesson 2.1—Network definition, types & uses 
Background 
In the early 21st century, most Americans encounter and use data and communications networks of 
many different types every day. We use them to communicate with friends, family and colleagues; to 
transact business of all types; to acquire information and exchange data; for entertainment and many 
other purposes. The networks we use are constructed and organized in different ways. For anyone 
interested in making more than casual use of networks, it’s important to understand some of the basic 
terms and concepts that define the various kinds of networks. 
Concepts 
1. Networks enable computer systems to communicate with one another, over distances of a few 
meters to thousands of kilometers. 
2. We use communications and data networks in a wide variety of ways. 
3. Computer networks can be categorized in many different ways, such as their scale, topology, 
the functional relationship among nodes, and the protocols that govern their operation. 
Student Learning Objectives 
1. To describe what data and communications networks are and to give examples of how they are 
used in everyday life. 
2. To define some basic terms used to describe and discuss networks. 
3. To be able to categorize computer networks in terms of their scale, the functional relationships 
among hosts, topology, and communications protocols.

word is used in everyday conversation. 
2. Begin to focus on computer (data) networks, seeking to apply some attributes of networks in a 
broader sense to their understanding of computer networks.  Ask students to list examples of 
computer networks they may encounter on a regular basis, both the obvious ones (like computer 
networks in their school) and less obvious networks, like automatic teller machine (ATM)

Lesson 2.2—Network Models: TCP/IP 
Background 
From the late 1980s through the 1990s, computer networks used a number of different, mostly 
incompatible, protocols developed and fielded by the makers of different computer and network 
operating systems. Examples include Appletalk, IPX/SPX, NeuBEUI, and DECNet, among others. 
With the growing popularity of the Internet beginning in the mid-1990s, most of these protocols have 
been deprecated in favor of the Internet protocol suite, known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control 
Protocol/Internet Protocol). TCP/IP is now supported by virtually every modern operating system, and 
is usually the default networking protocol. Since TCP/IP is platform independent, computer systems of 
virtually all types, running just about any operating system, are able to communicate without difficulty. 
TCP/IP uses a four-layer architecture, which serves as a useful model for understanding how computer 
networks function. In recent years, it has largely displaced the seven-layer Open Systems 
Communication (OSI) as the standard networking model. 
Concepts 
1. A networking protocol is a set of standards that governs communications among computing 
systems. 
2. Since the mid-1990s, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite has 
become the dominant protocol in computer networking. 
3. TCP/IP uses a four-layer architecture, consisting of (from the top down) the Application layer, 
Host-to-host transport layer, internetwork layer, and network access layer. This model is useful 
for understanding how TCP/IP networks function. 
4. TCP/IP uses encapsulation to provide abstraction of protocols and services between the layers.  
Student Learning Objectives 
1. To list the four layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack. 
2. To define basic networking terms including TCP, IP, UDP, protocol, encapsulation, checksum, 
datagram, connection-oriented protocol, connectionless protocol, best-effort delivery, packet, 
and error correction. 
3. To be able to describe how data moves from point to point through the TCP/IP protocol stack. 
4. To be able to describe how to send a simple email message via telnet.

Activity: Sending Email via Telnet 
 
Purpose  
Simple Mail Transport Protocol is the primary application layer protocol for electronic mail. 
The protocol's name is very descriptive. SMTP is a very simple protocol! In this activity, you 
will play the part of an email client program, doing everything email programs do to send email 
across the Internet. 
Procedure 
1. Using the Internet address provided by your instructor, make a telnet connection to the email 
server on the SMTP port (25).  
 If everything goes as it should, the server will respond with: 
220 tux.net ESMTP Sendmail 8.14.1/8.14.1... 
 Now press Enter to ensure the server is ready to accept commands. 
2. Send a HELO command, followed by an Internet name, to establish a mail session. Any name 
will work. For example: 
3. To start an email message, send the MAIL FROM: command, followed by the sender's email 
address: 
 MAIL FROM: owensjp@clarkson.edu 
Wait for a few moments to receive an acknowledgment. 
250 2.1.0 owensjp@clarkson.edu... Sender ok 
4. Now, send the recipient's email address, using the RCPT TO: command: 
 RCPT TO: jim@tux.net 
 250 2.1.5 jim@tux.net... Recipient ok 
5. Next, send the DATA command to start entering the text of your message: 
 DATA 
 354 Enter mail, end with “.” on a line by itself 
 
 Subject: Hello! 
  www.clarkson.edu/k12 
 This is a hand-crafted email message from your friend at Clarkson University. 
 
 
 Regards, 
 Jim 
6. To send your message, press the Enter key, followed by a period, and then the Enter key again. 
The server will respond with the message number. 
 250 2.0.0.0 19TBNOqp004826 Message accepted for delivery 
7. To end your session, enter QUIT. The server will say, “Bye” and close the connection. 
 QUIT 
 221 Bye 
 Connection closed by foreign host.

Lesson 2.3—Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses 
Background 
Every computer or device connected to the Internet has assigned to it a unique address, called an IP 
address, which functions something like a telephone number, allowing other Internet-connected 
devices to communicate with it. Internet Protocol version 4, or IPv4 for short, is the version currently in 
use on the Internet. Within the next five years, or so, IPv4 will be succeeded by IPv6, a protocol which 
supports many times the number of unique addresses available with IPv4, among other changes and 
enhancements. 
IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses, creating an address space of 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. IP addresses 
are normally represented using dot-decimal notation, four octets (values between 0 and 255) separated 
by “dots,” for example 68.236.159.234. IP addresses are grouped into three classes (A, B, and C), 
based on the value of the leading octet. The class of an IP address originally determined which portion 
of an IP address identified the network, with the remaining portion identifying a particular host on the 
network. Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) was introduced in the early 1990s to make more 
efficient use of the IPv4 address space. Subnet masks are now used to designate the portion of an IP 
address that identifies the network. 
Several address ranges within the IPv4 address space are reserved for special purposes, such as private 
network spaces, local loopback, multicast, etc. 
Concepts 
1. Every Internet-connected device must have a unique address, called an IP address. 
2. Internet Protocol version 4, called IPv4 for short, is the current standard. IPv4 uses 32-bit 
addressing, allowing for 4,294,967,296 unique addresses. 
3. IPv4 addresses are divided into classes, which loosely identify the number of hosts or devices 
that a network can support. These classes can be further subdivided using subnet masks, under a 
system called Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), creating smaller networks. 
4. The IPv4 address space contains a number of address ranges that are reserved for specialized 
uses, such as creating private networks.  
Student Learning Objectives 
1. To explain what an IP address is and how it is formed. 
2. Given an IP address, to identify its class, the network number and the rest. 
3. Given an IP address and a subnet mask or a classless address, to identify the network number 
and the rest. 
4. To describe the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses. 
5. To list some special address ranges in the IPv4 address and explain how they are used.

o With classful addressing, the number of bits used to identify the network is determined 
by the value of the first octet, as shown in the table below:

o Large network classes can be subdivided through the use of subnet masks, which 
identify the network portion of the IP address. Another method, called Classless Inter-
Domain Routing (CIDR) is also commonly used to subdivide larger network blocks. 
o About 589 million of the available IPv4 addresses are in reserved special ranges. Among 
these are 17,891,328 private network addresses.  These ranges are not routable outside 
of a private network, and machines with private addresses cannot directly communicate 
with public networks. They can, however, do so through network address translation.

Lesson 2.4—Ethernet LANs 
Background 
By the late 20th century, the term Ethernet had become synonymous with local area network. In fact, 
Ethernet is a proprietary set of technologies for local area networking, one of a number of competing 
approaches developed during the late-1970s and early-1980s. Although theoretically inferior to some 
other approaches, Ethernet proved superior in actual use and has become the de facto standard for 
LANs. 
Ethernet operates at the Network Access layer in the TCP/IP model. It uses the star networking 
topology, which has proved more robust than either the bus or ring topologies. At the physical layer, 
Ethernet uses unshielded twisted pair cabling primarily. The current standard for UTP is Category 5 
Enhanced, or Cat5e, supporting speeds of up to 1000 megabits per second, also known as Gigabit 
Ethernet. 
To support multiple users on a network, Ethernet uses a scheme called CSMA/CD, for carrier sense 
multiple access with collision detection. Ethernet hosts are connected via cables to network hubs or 
switches. Hubs are half-duplex devices that broadcast all network traffic to all connected devices. Thus, 
hubbed networks are much more prone to collisions, quickly degrading network performance. Switches 
are smarter devices, capable of “learning” the locations of connected hosts. Switches are therefore able 
to limit traffic based on the actual destination MAC (media access control) addresses of traffic, greatly 
reducing the number of collisions and making full duplex communications possible. 
Concepts 
1. The Ethernet networking protocols have become the de facto standard at the Link layer. 
2. Ethernet uses the star networking topology and a carrier sense multiple access with collision 
detection scheme. 
3. The Ethernet physical layer is comprised of cabling, primarily unshielded twisted pair; hubs; 
and switches. 
4. Switches are “smarter” devices than hubs, supporting higher networking speeds, particularly on 
busy networks. 
Student Learning Objectives 
1. List the most common network topologies and some advantages and disadvantages of each. 
2. Briefly describe the Ethernet LAN protocol in terms of its topology, communications scheme, 
and list the equipment required to create a simple Ethernet LAN. 
3. Explain how Ethernet's carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) 
works. 
4. Describe the differences between Ethernet hubs and switches, and explain why switches are 
preferred.

Lesson 2.5—Network Cabling 
Background 
In Ethernet's star topology, computers and other network devices are connected together using cables. 
Unshielded twisted pair, or UTP for short, is the most common cable used for local area networks. The 
current standard for UTP cables is Category 5 Enhanced, better known as Cat5e. Cat5e cable is 
available in a number of varieties, suitable for different wiring applications. Cable runs are terminated 
with RJ45 connectors. Making network cables is a relatively simple process. In addition to cable and 
connectors, only a crimper wire trimmer, and perhaps a pair of scissors is required. Two standards for 
the arrangement of UTP pairs have been defined: TIA/EIA 568A and TIA/EIA 568B. 
Concepts 
1. Of the available cable types, unshielded twisted pair cabling is most commonly used in local 
area networks. 
2. UTP cabling consists of four twisted pairs of insulated conductors, wrapped in an insulating 
sheath. 
3. Several distinct categories of UTP cabling have been defined, based on their construction and 
specifications. Category 5 Enhanced (Cat5e) is the current standard for LANs. 
4. Cat5e is manufactured in several varieties, suitable for different cabling applications. 
5. Cable runs are terminated with RJ45 connectors. 
6. Making up patch cables is a relatively simple process, requiring only a few simple tools. 
Student Learning Objectives 
1. List common cable types used in networking. 
2. Describe how UTP cables are made. 
3. Explain how UTP cables are used in Ethernet networks. 
4. Demonstrate the ability to make a working patch cable. 
5. Name the two wiring standards used for wired Ethernet networks and their uses.

Lesson 2.6—Wired Local Area Networks 
Background 
Small wired local area networks (LANs) are easy to set up and maintain, using inexpensive 
components that are readily available in most office supply stores. Small networks can serve a variety 
of purposes in the small office/home office (SOHO) environment, making it possible to share resources 
such as an Internet connection, printers, scanners, and other devices among several computers. In 
addition, simple peer-to-peer networks can facilitate collaboration by making it easy to share and back 
up files across the network.  
When implemented using Ethernet and TCP/IP networking protocols, networks can link virtually any 
type of computer system, including those running Windows, Linux and Unix, Macintosh, and other 
systems. Small networks can be as simple as two computers linked directly with a crossover cable, or 
they can link a larger number of systems using an Ethernet hub or switch. To share an Internet 
connection, a network router is also required, to connect the local network to the wide area network, the 
Internet. 
Depending on the needs and skill level of the network's users, a simple peer-to-peer, or workgroup, 
may be recommended. Greater security and streamlined management of network resources is a feature 
of client-server networks. A variety of software systems are available for setting up client-server 
networks, a number of which are Open Source systems available at no cost. While these network 
systems can be more secure and robust, set up and management of client-server networks requires a 
higher level of skill than peer-to-peer networks.  
Concepts 
1. Small peer-to-peer networks can be constructed using a few inexpensive, readily available 
components. 
2. Two computers can be networked using only a crossover network cable. 
3. Three or more computers can be networked using an Ethernet hub or switch and standard UTP 
patch cables. Assignment of static IP addresses is normally required with networks of this type. 
4. Dynamic assignment of IP addresses in simple networks can be accomplished by using an 
inexpensive router in place of a hub or switch. In this case, computers are networked using the 
Ethernet switch that is usually included in these devices. 
5. Network connectivity can be tested using ping, which sends a series of ICMP (Internet Control 
Message Protocol) packets to another host on the network. 
6. The use of ping and other network tools that generate ICMP packets may be restricted by local 
network policies or packet-filtering software and devices. 
Student Learning Objectives 
1. Set up a simple peer-to-peer network using dynamic IP addresses. 
2. Determine a networked computer's MAC and IP addresses, netmask, gateway, and DNS 
settings using network software tools available in Windows and Linux. 
3. Set up a simple peer-to-peer network using static IP addresses, using network software tools 
available in Windows and Linux. 
4. Test a computer's network connectivity using ping. 
5. Discuss some possible limitations on the use of ping within local or between local and distant 
networks.

Lesson 2.7—Sharing Resources with Samba 
Background 
A primary reason for networking computers is to allow the sharing of resources, including files, 
printers and other hardware resources. While the open TCP/IP protocol suite has become the standard 
for networking, most operating systems continue to use proprietary or non-standard protocols to 
support file and hardware device sharing. This fact can make it difficult to share resources between 
computers running different operating systems. An effective solution to sharing resources among 
diverse computer systems is the Open Source Samba package. Samba provides its own implementation 
of Microsoft's SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block/Common Internet File System) protocols, which are 
used to support resource sharing over Windows networks. Versions of Samba have been developed for 
all the major desktop computer operating systems, and most systems come with the client-side Samba 
software installed and ready to use. Thus, Samba is an excellent choice for demonstrating file sharing 
among disparate computer systems on a network. 
Concepts 
1. Resource sharing is a primary purpose for computer networking. 
2. The TCP/IP protocol suite has become the standard for networking among all major operating 
systems, yet most systems continue to use proprietary or non-standard protocols to support 
resource sharing. This lack of standardization can make it difficult to share resources among 
computers running different operating systems. 
3. The Open Source Samba package, which is based on the Windows protocols for file and printer 
sharing, can be used to share files and printers among many different types of computers. 
4. Most major operating systems now include the Samba client software necessary to use 
Windows file and printer shares by default. This software is quite simple to configure and use. 
5. Samba server software is also available for all major operating systems. When properly 
configured, Samba makes it possible to share resources with virtually any kind of computing 
system to meet a variety of different needs, from simple file sharing at home, to sophisticated 
and secure systems on enterprise-level networks. 
Student Learning Objectives 
1. To discuss the advantages of resource sharing on computer networks. 
2. To use ping to confirm connectivity on a computer network. 
3. Given a username, password, and domain name, to be able to connect to a Samba share over a 
network. 
4. To be able to retrieve a file from a secure Samba share and update it. 
5. To briefly describe the differences between user-level and share-level security in Samba. 
6. To briefly discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of user-level and share-level 
security.

Lesson 2.8—Wireless LANs 
Background 
While networking offers a number of advantages for sharing resources and information, wireless 
networking can offer even more advantages, in terms of mobility, flexibity, convenience and cost. In 
place of UTP cables and hubs or switches, wireless LANs use radio waves to connect computers, 
personal digital assistants (PDAs), telephones, and other devices to wireless access points (WAPs) or 
wireless routers. Wireless networking technologies can also be used to connect computers and similar 
devices directly, in ad hoc networks. 
Wireless networking protocols have been standardized under several protocols: 802.11a/b/g and a 
newer standard still under development as of this writing, 802.11n. The individual standards are 
defined by the radio spectrum used for communications among hosts, throughput speed, encryption 
methods utilized, and other factors. The two most common standards as of late 2006 are 802.11b and 
802.11g. A new standard, 802.11n is expected to be fielded by mid-2007. 
Wireless LANs consist of one or more wireless access points (WAPs) and one or more clients. 
Wireless LANs resemble non-switched Ethernet networks in that all connected hosts compete for the 
same available bandwidth, using a carrier sense multiple access protocol with collision avoidance 
(CSMA/CA), as opposed to Ethernet’s CSMA/CD protocol. This difference is necessitated by the fact 
that hosts on a wireless LAN may not be able to “hear” each other well enough to detect collisions. 
Therefore, collisions on wireless LANs must be avoided, rather than simply detected. 
Wireless LANs offer a number of advantages over wired Ethernet LANs, primarily in terms of their 
ease of installation and flexibility. Wireless LANs also bring a number of disadvantages, including 
interference from mobile phones, microwave ovens, and other devices; limited range, and the 
vulnerability of messages passed over open networks or those with weak encryption. 
Concepts 
1. Wireless networking, also called WiFi, uses radio waves instead of cables to connect hosts. 
2. Several standards have been defined for wireless networking, under IEEE 802.11. The two most 
common standards are currently 802.11b and 802.11g. A new standard 802.11n, which 
promises much greater speed, is due out in mid-2007. 
3. WLANs consist of one or more wireless access points, called WAPs, and clients such as 
desktop or laptop computers, personal digital assistants, and cell phones. 
4. WLANs use a modified version of the Ethernet protocol, carrier sense multiple access with 
collision avoidance (CSMA/CA), for communications among network nodes. 
5.  WLANs can be easier and cheaper to set up than wired LANs. They also permit mobility and 
more flexibility than wired LANs. Disadvantages include potential interference from mobile 
phones, microwave ovens and other devices. WLANs also pose security challenges since open 
connections are subject to interception and unintentional use.  
Student Learning Objectives 
1. To briefly describe wireless networking and how it works. 
2. To list and differentiate among the currently defined wireless networking standards. 
3. To list the equipment required to set up a wireless LAN. 
4. To demonstrate how to set up a wireless LAN, using a SOHO wireless router. 
5. To discuss the advantages and disadvantages of wireless LANs. 
6. To explain how the security problems often associated with wireless LANs can be mitigated.

Notes 
 In a 40-minute period, there isn't enough time for students to actually implement all of the security 
measures discussed. The demonstration and discussion of not broadcasting the SSID and restricting 
access by MAC address may be sufficient, along with the caution that these measures can be readily 
defeated by a determined intruder, who is equipped with the right tools and a pretty good understanding 
of wireless networking.
