Abstract  
 
Background: Embedded systems are evolving in their use based on the increased 
trend of merging software with hardware appliances. The market for the embedded 
systems development is rapidly increasing and this is one of the possible new markets 
for software firms striving for new competitive advantage. Objectives: The goal of 
the paper is to explore embedded systems development practices of Croatian firms 
and compare them with the practices of the firms from South Eastern European (SEE) 
countries. Methods/Approach: The survey was conducted using the sample of SME 
software firms and the data on embedded systems development practices have 
been analysed. Practices of Croatian firms were compared with practices of other 
firms from SEE countries. Results: Results of the survey revealed that in comparison to 
their counterparts from SEE countries, Croatian firms involved in embedded systems 
development utilise cutting-edge technology and processes to a lower extent. 
Conclusions: Cutting-edge technology and processes are prerequisites for attaining 
the level of productivity in software production that is sufficient to ensure maintaining 
cost competency. However, SMEs are yet to fulfil their market potentials.

Introduction  
Embedded systems are both the long-time known, and the currently highly 
propulsive part of technology. They are defined as computer systems forming a part 
of a larger system, performing specific function. One of their characteristics is that 
they are combination of mutually interconnected hardware and software. Despite

that interconnectedness, the embedded systems' software development is a well-
defined market segment (Schlett, 2000). All statistics and predictions point to rapid 
future increase in their use, both in quantity (BCC Research, 2012; Lakka et al., 2013) 
and versatile areas of application (Jerbić, 2007). 
 According to Ilgin et al. there are strict necessities related to the target system 
operation containing safety and real-time operation within the area of embedded 
systems design and development (Ilgin et al., 2010). Firms that compete at the 
market of development and implementation of embedded system has to strive for 
excellence in terms of software quality, that is attained through the use of formal 
development practices, variety of system platforms used, broad range of 
software/hardware integration practices and serious approach to performance 
evaluation and performance optimization. 
 In this article we concentrate onto national use of embedded systems’ 
development practices of SME software firms that compete in the market of 
embedded systems, analyse it and compare with the corresponding use in Greece 
and Serbia. In order to measure embedded systems’ development practices a 
survey on the sample of SME software firms was conducted. Following research 
questions were defined for the purpose of the article:  
o RQ1 – What embedded system development issues are used among SMEs? 
o RQ3 – What software/hardware integration practices are used among SMEs? 
o RQ3 – What performance evaluation and performance optimization are used 
among SMEs? 
 This research framework aims to complete the empirical outlook to the 
embedded system development practice in SME software firms in selected SEE 
countries. These research questions are relevant both to the IT industry and IT 
academics because embedded system systems become increasingly important 
new market, and there is a rising call for gaining as much knowledge as possible on 
current practical issues. Moreover, it is important to develop tools available to SMEs 
that would increase quality of embedded systems and thus allow them to compete 
to larger firms. SME software firms that target embedded systems market needs to 
adapt to the growing quality standards that would be best accomplished by using 
technical methodologies, additionally an open and customisable toolset.  
 The article is organised as follows: data collecting methodology was described in 
the second section; third section lists some of the collected results, while fourth 
section concludes the article and lists some perspectives. 
 
Information and communication technology  
Through the increasing popularity of the global network Internet began the rapid 
growth of the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. That was in 
the early 1980s. Internet was also a main infrastructure for commerce (e-commerce) 
and communication. The major portion of an ICT firm investment is in the field of 
research and development (R&D), nevertheless financing such expenditure is 
difficult in a competitive marketplace. Investment decisions are often related to the 
availability of cash flow, regardless of the industry (Aoun et al., 2008). There are many 
benefits related to usage of the ICT, in addition, their quality usage save money 
and/or time. ICTs have as their main features the application of knowledge, and 
they also generate new knowledge. Ollo-López et al. point out that ICT take on a 
main role in the economy transformation process in addition to constituting a vital 
source of competitiveness for the companies. Use of ICT seems to increase the level 
of competitiveness in the companies (Ollo-López et al., 2012). Information and 
  
 
 
59 
 
Business Systems Research Vol. 5 No. 1 / March 2014 
communication technology (ICT) has improved the quality life of the citizens and 
enhanced the growth of the global economy. Ti has brought new ways of creating 
livings for individuals (Doong et al., 2012). According to García-Villaverde et al. the 
ICT industry is shifting rapidly in reaction to technology and market developments, 
competition and regulation change (García-Villaverde et al., 2011). Internal factors 
in corporations are crucial for adopting and using ICT in order to increase business 
performance and competitiveness (Pejić Bach et al., 2013). The turbulent times are 
the main characteristics of the ICT industry (Crnković, 2013).  
According to Grasser one of the fastest growing sectors in the ICT are embedded 
technologies. There are still open fields with many business occasions. Practically all 
products are associated with embedded systems components in order to reach the 
market (Grasser, 2007). Furthermore, due to their ability to widely distribute power 
through their small, inexpensive and ubiquitous characteristics, embedded systems 
compromise larger opportunities and worries. They are some kind of the extension of 
ICT, which deals with large networks of small computing devices (LePoire, 2004). 
 
Methodology  
Survey on embedded system development practices was conducted as one of the 
activities of FP7 project, MODUS-Methodology and supporting toolset advancing 
embedded systems quality (Project No.: 286583). Goal of the project is to provide 
pragmatic and viable solutions in terms of a set of technical methodologies and 
open and customisable toolset that will permit SMEs to substantially advance their 
positioning within the embedded‐systems development market. An open and 
customisable toolset with a set of technical methodologies, evolving embedded 
systems quality when using Formal Description Techniques (FDTs) will be developed 
and validated. It was decided that primarily firms that provide embedded system for 
automotive, avionic and telecommunication industries will be targeted. Members of 
the MODUS project developed questionnaire used in the survey. 
 Survey was conducted on the sample of SME software firms in Croatia and 
selected SEE countries (Greece, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina). Target group 
of firms were SMEs specialising in the development of embedded systems in different 
industrial sectors (avionics, automotive systems, telecommunications and other). For 
the purpose of the survey, random sample approach was employed since 
embedded systems are developed by the limited number of software firms. In 
Croatia, firms registered for software development were identified using Croatian 
Company Directory (http://www1.biznet.hr/HgkWeb/do/extlogon). Firms that 
registered Computer programming, consultancy and related activities (Nace 2007 
Code: J62) as primary business activity and with number of employees from 1 to 250 
were selected using Advanced search option. Total number of 1456 firms was 
selected. Random sample of 600 firms were selected, and 9 firms participated in the 
survey. In the same time 20 firms from other SEE countries also participated in the 
survey. Due to the small number of firms that participated in the survey, this research 
is considered as a preliminary research that will be followed by more comprehensive 
research in the future. When sample size considerations were at least partly attained, 
chi-square test has been applied in order to test differences between Croatian and 
other SEE countries’ firms.  
 Table 1 represents number of employees involved in embedded SW/HW 
development in the sample companies. Croatian firms involved in embedded 
systems software development are smaller measured in terms of number of 
employees compared to total sample firms. More Croatian firms have 1 do 10 
employees involved in SW/HW development (89 % firms) compared to total sample 
  
 
 
60 
 
Business Systems Research Vol. 5 No. 1 / March 2014 
(62 % firms). On the other side, in the total sample there is 28% of the firms with more 
than 10 employees involved in SW/HW development, while in Croatian sample, only 
11% of firms employ that number. Chi-square test revealed that the difference in 
structure of total sampled firms and Croatian sampled firms in number of employees 
involved in SW/HW development is statistically significant at 1% (2=18.713, p-
value=0,000).

 Areas of application are broad for software firms that develop and implement 
embedded system, and there are differences among Croatian software SME firms 
and other firms from selected SEE countries (Table 2). None of the Croatian firms 
develop software for avionics industry, but ratio of Croatian firms that develop 
software for automotive and telecommunication industry is larger compared to the 
ratio of selected SEE countries. Other areas of application for which the 
firms/organizations develop embedded system are defence, control, technical 
automation, finance, banking, medical care, camera motion control, space, video 
monitoring, and video surveillance. Among those, Croatian firms mentioned camera 
motion control, medical software and banking. Chi-square test revealed that 
difference between Croatian firms and other countries’ firms is statistically significant 
only for automotive industry at 1% level (2 = 12.715, p-value = 0.000), avionics 
industry at 10% level (2 = 3.046, p-value = 0.080) and other industries at 1% level (2 
= 8.365, p-value = 0.004).

Results 
Embedded system development issues 
Embedded system development issues are presented in Table 3, and refer to: (1) 
Modelling languages used for software development, (2) Testing the software 
developed by the company, (3) Generating the source code, (4) Coding 
standards/recommendations that firms use for software development, (5) 
Verification of the designed models, and (6) Target code of the firms.  
 Modelling languages used for software development. The most used modelling 
language for software development is UML that is used among 52% of the firms from 
the total sample and 44% of the Croatian firms. None of the Croatian firms use 
Simulink/Stateflow, which is used among 15% of other SEE countries’ firms. Other 
modelling languages used for software development were custom solution 
(Croatian firm), SSA, Sybase Power Designer, and MERISE. Chi-square test revealed 
that difference between Croatian firms and other countries’ firms is statistically 
significant for the usage of Simulink/Stateflow, no modelling language and other 
language usage. 
 Testing the software developed by the firm. In most of the cases, sample firms test 
the software developed by the firm with manual test cases, while automated test 
cases and specific tools are used to the lesser extent. Specific tools used for testing 
the software developed by the firm were Test Link, Selenium, Test Complete, gMeter, 
Custom tools, IBM Rational Functional tester, IBM Rational Performance tester and MS 
Visual Studio TFS. There are no significant differences among Croatian and other SEE 
countries’ firms, except for the testing with specific tools.  
 Generating the source code. Firms from both Croatia and total sample generate 
the code in most of the cases manually. Although smaller number of firms is using 
automatic code generation; it is interesting to know which practices were used. 
Automatic code generation using commercial code generator used were Microsoft 
Visual Studio, Interpreting models instead of generating code, Power Designer + 
Eclipse (Croatian firm) and 2E (Croatian firm).  
 Coding standards/recommendations that firms use for software development. 
None of the Croatian firms is using coding standards/recommendations for software 
development, while other SEE countries’ firms are using MISRA C and CERT C Secure 
Coding Standard. Other coding standards recommendations that firms use for 
software development were Sun Microsystems, MSDN C# Usage Guidelines. ("Design 
Guidelines for Class Library Developers" - Microsoft), Coding Standard: C# - Philips 
Medical Systems, LabVIEW Development Guidelines, Java development community 
standard, Custom coding convention, Oracle code conventions for the Java 
programming language (Croatian firm), ECSS, MISRA C-based internal code 
conventions, and All-In-One Code Framework Coding Guideline. 
 Verification of the designed models. More firms from the other SEE countries use 
tools for verification of the designed models compared to Croatian firms. Tools for 
verification of the designed models were Enterprise Architect, and Internal, project-
based tools. Difference among Croatian and other firms is statistically significant at 
1% level.  
 Target code of the firms. Target code of the firms refers in most of the cases to 
language C (C, C#, C++, and Java. Other target code of the firms were php, Ruby, 
Python, LabVIEW, VB.NET, Javascript (Croatian firm), SQL + SQLJ (Croatian firm), VB6+ 
VB.NET + ASSEMBLY (Croatian firm), and FORTRAN. There are some differences 
between Croatian firms and other countries’ firms, and statistically significant 
difference has been found for C, C# and other target codes.

 System platforms are broad for software firms that develop and implement 
embedded system, and there are differences among Croatian software SME firms 
and other firms from selected SEE countries (Table 4). Croatian firms used only some 
system platforms such as Windows, Linix and Unix. Other firms used much more 
system platforms and the most used are Windows, Linux, Android, Windows Mobile. 
Chi-square test revealed that difference between Croatian firms and other 
countries’ firms is statistically significant for Windows platform, which is used the most, 
at 1% level (2 = 15.672, p-value = 0.000), for Macos at 1% level (2 = 9.205, p-value =

Software/hardware integration practices  
Software/hardware integration practices presented in Table 5 refer to: (1) 
Communication interfaces used by the software developed, (2) Target processors for 
the software developed, (3) Process for best matching Hardware/Software co-
simulation, and (4) Performance requirements for hardware.  
 Communication interfaces used by the system developed. Serial port, USB and 
Ethernet communication interfaces are still the most popular among firms that 
develop embedded system, both in Croatian and other SEE countries’ firms. 
However, firms from other SEE countries use Wireless more compared to Croatian 
firms. 
 Target processors for the system developed. There are some differences among 
Croatian and other SEE countries’ firms according to target processors (Intel x86, 
Power PC, and ARM) for the system developed. Other ARM processors targeted for 
the system developed were IBM z series, CorTax, Philips PNX 1000 (Croatian firm), 
LPC1768 -Cortex M3(Croatian firm), Texas Instruments ARM, DSP and MSP430 chips, 
(SPARC) LEON, ARM9, S3C2440, ARM7, ARM9, Cortex A8, Cortex M0, M3, ARM7, and 
ARM9. 
 Process for best matching Hardware/Software co-simulation. Most of the SMEs 
software firms do not use process for best matching Hardware/Software co-
simulation, while smaller number of firms from both Croatian and other countries’ 
firms develop system on a hardware virtual platform, or design both software and 
hardware concurrently. Other process for best matching Hardware/Software co-

simulation were Effectiveness analysis defined by ISO 9001:2008, Matlab plotting 
graphs, Response time, load performance, mem performance, storage 
performance, Internal, Custom specific, and Built-in performance profiler in Visual 
Studio.  
 Performance requirements for hardware. In the process of embedded system 
development and usage it is important to define and attain performance 
requirements for hardware. The most targeted performance requirements are 
related to real-time, which is implemented by 86% of Croatian firms and 85% of other 
SEE countries’ firms. Power-consumption is required by approximately two-fifts of both 
Croatian and total sample firms, while memory used is more used by total sample 
firms. Other performance requirements for hardware were overnight processing of 
large data quantities (Croatian firm) and radiation hardened.

Performance evaluation and performance optimization for 
embedded system development 
Performance evaluation methods should increase trust in embedded system 
solutions (Table 6). Performance evaluation methods used were Effectiveness 
analysis defined by ISO 9001:2008, Matlab plotting graphs, Response time, load 
performance, mem performance, storage performance, Custom specific, and Built-
in performance profiler in Visual Studio. Listed methods are more used among other 
SEE countries’ firms compared to Croatian firms, and Chi-square test has revealed 
that the difference is statistically significant at 5% level (2=8.335, p-value=0.015). 
Performance optimization for embedded system development is significant factor in 
attaining effectiveness and efficiency of embedded systems. Performance 
optimization for developed software and hardware used were gMeter, PMD, 
FindBugs, Check Style, Custom tools and methodology, manual, Device specific, 
and Built-in. Again, chi-square test has revealed that the difference is not statistically 
significant (2=0.022, p-value=0.882) between Croatian and other SEE countries’ 
firms.

Conclusions 
In this paper the activities involved in embedded systems development issues, 
software/hardware integration practices and performance evaluation and 
optimization has been examined based on the survey sample of 29 SME software 
firms from selected SEE countries. Following are main conclusions from this research. 
Development of embedded systems incorporates number of important issues and 
they involve both technical and business aspects in terms of quality. However, there 
is still a lot of space for improvement, especially for SME software firms.  
 Diverse areas of applications (avionics, automotive, telecommunication, defence 
and control) for embedded systems developed indicate both flexibility of SMEs and 
increase of the embedded systems market, since number of emerging areas of 
application has been named (technical automation, finance, banking, medical 
care, camera motion control, space, video monitoring, and video surveillance).

 The twenty nine SME software firms come into sight to specify that few SME firms 
did not yet implemented formal procedures for development of embedded systems 
like. Small number of firm use modelling languages (UML, Simulink/Stateflow), in most 
of the cases software has been tested manually and the source code has been 
rarely developed by usage of automatic tools. Coding standards/recommendations 
are rarely used, as well as verification of designed models. In addition, SMEs are using 
limited set of programming languages. In terms of software/hardware integration, 
firms have developed more various practices. 
 Firms are using all of the most currently popular communication interfaces at least 
to some extent, and variety of targeted processors are used for software developed. 
However, firms rarely use process for best matching Hardware/Software co-
simulation. Still, much attention has been given to performance requirements for 
hardware, like real-time, power-consumption and memory used.  
 Although most of the firms from selected SEE countries are not implementing best 
practice in embedded systems development, Croatian firms lag behind especially in 
terms of: (1) lack of automated testing of the embedded systems, (2) usage of 
automatic source generators, (3) usage of coding standards/recommendations, (4) 
verification of the designed models, (5) process for best matching 
Hardware/Software co-simulation, and (6) performance evaluation and 
optimization. 
 MODUS project developed processes and software tools that allow the 
identification of design optimisations to be automatically applied, and the 
generation of source code that respects coding standards/conventions. In addition, 
these tools were tested as possible bridges against current shortcomings in the area 
of embedded systems development. In future work, data for segments of 
embedded systems applications which have not develop significantly, e.g. robotics 
as part of automatics, should be collected in order to make possible mutual ranking 
based on the maturity status of diverse embedded systems and corresponding 
technologies.
