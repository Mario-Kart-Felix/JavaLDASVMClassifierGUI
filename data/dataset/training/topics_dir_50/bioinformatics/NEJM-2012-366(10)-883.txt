Background
Intratumor heterogeneity may foster tumor evolution and adaptation and hinder 
personalized-medicine strategies that depend on results from single tumor-biopsy 
samples.
Methods
To examine intratumor heterogeneity, we performed exome sequencing, chromosome 
aberration analysis, and ploidy profiling on multiple spatially separated samples ob-
tained from primary renal carcinomas and associated metastatic sites. We character-
ized the consequences of intratumor heterogeneity using immunohistochemical analy-
sis, mutation functional analysis, and profiling of messenger RNA expression.
Results
Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed branched evolutionary tumor growth, with 63 to 
69% of all somatic mutations not detectable across every tumor region. Intratumor 
heterogeneity was observed for a mutation within an autoinhibitory domain of the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase, correlating with S6 and 4EBP 
phosphorylation in vivo and constitutive activation of mTOR kinase activity in vitro. 
Mutational intratumor heterogeneity was seen for multiple tumor-suppressor genes 
converging on loss of function; SETD2, PTEN, and KDM5C underwent multiple dis-
tinct and spatially separated inactivating mutations within a single tumor, suggesting 
convergent phenotypic evolution. Gene-expression signatures of good and poor prog-
nosis were detected in different regions of the same tumor. Allelic composition and 
ploidy profiling analysis revealed extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with 26 of 30 tu-
mor samples from four tumors harboring divergent allelic-imbalance profiles and with 
ploidy heterogeneity in two of four tumors.
Conclusions
Intratumor heterogeneity can lead to underestimation of the tumor genomics landscape 
portrayed from single tumor-biopsy samples and may present major challenges to 
personalized-medicine and biomarker development. Intratumor heterogeneity, asso-
ciated with heterogeneous protein function, may foster tumor adaptation and thera-
peutic failure through Darwinian selection. (Funded by the Medical Research Council

Large-scale sequencing analyses of solid cancers have identified extensive hetero-geneity between individual tumors.1-6 Genet-
ic intratumor heterogeneity has also been shown7-15 
and can contribute to treatment failure and drug 
resistance. Intratumor heterogeneity may have im-
portant consequences for personalized-medicine 
approaches that commonly rely on single tumor-
biopsy samples to portray tumor mutational land-
scapes. Studies comparing mutational profiles of 
primary tumors and associated metastatic le-
sions16,17 or local recurrences18 have provided evi-
dence of intratumor heterogeneity at nucleotide 
resolution. Intratumor heterogeneity within pri-
mary tumors and associated metastatic sites has 
not been systematically characterized by next-gen-
eration sequencing. We applied exome sequenc-
ing, chromosome aberration analysis, and DNA 
ploidy profiling to study multiple spatially sepa-
rated biopsy samples from primary renal-cell car-
cinomas and associated metastatic sites. We in-
vestigated the phenotypic consequences of genetic 
intratumor heterogeneity and the representation 
of the tumor genomic landscape by a single tumor-
biopsy sample, the current basis for most bio-
marker discovery and personalized-medicine ap-
proaches.
Me thods
We evaluated tumor-biopsy samples from four con-
secutive patients with metastatic renal-cell carci-
noma who were enrolled in the Personalized RNA 
Interference to Enhance the Delivery of Individu-
alized Cytotoxic and Targeted Therapeutics clinical 
trial of everolimus (E-PREDICT; EudraCT number, 
2009-013381-54) before and after cytoreductive ne-
phrectomy. Biopsy samples were obtained before 
the initiation of 6 weeks of treatment with evero-
limus. After a 1-week washout period in which 
patients did not receive everolimus, a nephrectomy 
was performed. Everolimus treatment was contin-
ued after recovery from surgery until tumor pro-
gression. Figure 1 shows biopsy and treatment 
timelines.
We performed whole-exome multiregion spatial 
sequencing on DNA that was extracted from fresh-
frozen samples obtained from Patients 1 and 2, as 
described previously,19 with paired-end reads of 
72 bp and 75 bp, respectively, on Illumina Genome 
Analyzer IIx and HiSeq platforms. We performed 
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array anal-
ysis on Illumina Omni2.5 and messenger RNA 
(mRNA) expression profiling on Affymetrix Gene 
1.0 arrays.
All four patients provided written informed 
consent. Details regarding materials and meth-
ods are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org. The study protocol is also available at 
NEJM.org.
R esult s
Patients
Patient 1 had a clear-cell carcinoma, pulmonary 
metastases, and a chest-wall metastasis. Sequenc-
ing detected a 2-bp deletion in the von Hippel–
Lindau tumor-suppressor gene (VHL) leading to 
mutational inactivation, which is characteristic of 
clear-cell carcinoma. After 6 weeks of everolimus 
treatment and a 1-week washout period, a nephrec-
tomy was performed. The patient restarted evero-
limus for 6 weeks and after another 1-week wash-
out period proceeded to surgery of the chest-wall 
mass (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) did not 
reveal any change in the dimensions of the primary 
tumor or chest-wall metastasis during everolimus 
treatment.
Identification and Validation of Somatic 
Mutations
For Patient 1, we performed exon-capture multire-
gion sequencing on DNA from pretreatment biopsy 
samples of the primary tumor (PreP) and chest-
wall metastasis (PreM), nine primary-tumor re-
gions of the nephrectomy specimen (R1 to R9), a 
metastasis in the perinephric fat of the nephrecto-
my specimen (M1), two regions of the excised chest-
wall metastasis (M2a and M2b), and germline 
DNA19 (Fig. 2A). This sequencing resulted in a me-
dian coverage of 74 reads (Table 1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). Nonsynonymous somatic 
point mutations and insertions and deletions (in-
dels) that change the protein amino acid sequence 
were filtered and manually reviewed to remove se-
quencing and alignment errors and to determine 
the regional distribution of mutations. Regions R6 
and R7 were excluded from analyses since only 
one nonsynonymous variant passed filtering. We 
identified 101 nonsynonymous point mutations 
and 32 indels (Table 2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix) and mapped their regional distributions 
across the tumor (Fig. 2B). Sanger sequencing was

used to validate 42 mutations. Of these mutations, 
37 (88%) were specifically validated in regions in 
which they were initially identified (Fig. 2B, and 
Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix), document-
ing genetic intratumor heterogeneity.
A low false negative mutation call rate is re-
quired to avoid overestimation of intratumor het-
erogeneity. We performed ultradeep exon-capture 
sequencing of R4 and R9 (median coverage of 262 
and 255 reads, respectively) to investigate whether 
heterogeneous mutations that were not found in 
R4 or R9 could be detected by increasing the se-
quencing depth (i.e., the median number of se-
quencing reads across each exon). This identified 
all 64 mutations known to be present in R4 and 75 
mutations in R9 and detected only 2 additional 
mutations (in ITGB3 and AKAP8, both in R4) pres-
ent in other primary regions, indicating a low 
false negative rate of 2 in 141 (1.4%) (Table 3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Somatic Mutational Heterogeneity  
and Clonal Ordering
We excluded 5 mutations that were not validated 
and classified the remaining 128 mutations into 
40 ubiquitous mutations, 59 mutations shared by 
several but not all regions, and 29 mutations that 
were unique to specific regions (so-called private 
mutations) that were present in a single region. We 
subdivided shared mutations into 31 mutations 
shared by most of the primary tumor regions of the 
nephrectomy specimen (R1 to R3, R5, and R8 to 
R9), pretreatment biopsy samples of the primary 
tumor, and 28 mutations shared by most of the 
metastatic regions. The detection of private muta-
tions suggested ongoing regional clonal evolution.
We inferred ancestral relationships and con-
structed a phylogenetic tree of the tumor regions 
by clonal ordering, as described by Merlo et al.20 
(Fig. 2C), which revealed branching rather than 
linear tumor evolution. One branch evolved into 
the clones present in metastatic sites, and the 
other diversified into primary tumor regions. R4 
shared some, but not all, primary-tumor and meta-
static mutations, which suggested the presence of 
at least two clonal populations in this region that 
arose from progenitor cells of the metastases and 
of other primary tumor sites. Variant frequencies 
in the R4 ultradeep-sequencing data revealed that 
mutations shared with metastatic sites were de-
tected at higher frequencies than were mutations 
shared with other primary-tumor regions, further 
supporting the presence of two subclones in R4 
(Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix). (For an 
exploratory phylogenetic analysis of the synony-
mous mutations, see Fig. 3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.)
A single biopsy revealed an average of 70 so-
matic mutations, approximately 55% of all mu-
tations detected in this tumor. Only 34% of all 
mutations that were detected by multiregion se-
quencing in the nephrectomy specimen were pres-
ent in all regions (31% if pretreatment and me-
tastasectomy samples were included), indicating 
that a single biopsy was not representative of the 
mutational landscape of the entire tumor bulk.
To address whether everolimus exposure may 
contribute to intratumor heterogeneity, we com-
pared the phylogenetic relationships of pretreat-
ment samples with those obtained after treatment 
samples (Fig. 2C). Of 71 mutations in pretreatment 
samples of the primary tumor, 67 were also pres-
ent in post-treatment primary-tumor regions, and 
64 of 66 mutations in the chest-wall metastases 
were present in post-treatment metastatic regions, 
indicating that the two main branches of the phy-
logenetic tree were present before drug treatment. 
Consistent with the post-treatment analysis, 60%

primary tumor and chest-wall metastases were not 
shared by both biopsy samples. Clones in R4 are 
unlikely to have evolved from pretreatment sam-
ples of the primary tumor or chest-wall metastases 
during therapy, since such evolution would have 
required the reversion of a large number of so-
matic mutations to wild-type, further supporting 
the presence of intratumor heterogeneity before 
treatment. Finally, samples taken before and after 
6 and 12 weeks of everolimus exposure had simi-
lar numbers of nonsynonymous mutations (Fig. 4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Thus, everolimus 
does not appear to increase the mutational load, 
and the main phylogenetic branches were present 
in the tumor before treatment, indicating that in-
tratumor heterogeneity was not a consequence of 
everolimus treatment.
Regional Ploidy Profiling and Chromosomal 
Aberration Detection
Ploidy profiling21 revealed a diploid profile for the 
majority of primary regions, whereas region m2b 
of the excised chest-wall metastasis harbored two 
subtetraploid populations (Fig. 2D). R4, the region 
most resembling the metastatic sites through 
clonal-ordering analysis, had a tetraploid profile, 
which suggests that the subtetraploid population 
in the chest-wall metastasis may have developed 
from a tetraploid intermediate in R4. Tumor re-
gions were subjected to SNP-array–based allelic-
imbalance detection to identify chromosomal aber-
rations. Pretreatment samples of the primary tumor 
and metastasis were excluded because of insuffi-
cient DNA, and R1, R3, and R5 failed quality con-
trol. Sections of allelic imbalance on chromosome 
3p were the only ubiquitous abnormalities (Fig. 5A 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Taken together 
with the corresponding reduced array signal in-
tensities on chromosome 3p (Fig. 5B in the Sup-
plementary Appendix), this indicated loss of het-
erozygosity through single deletion events in these 
3p sections encoding VHL and the histone H3K36 
methyltransferase SETD2. No tumor regions shared 
identical allelic-imbalance profiles, and heteroge-
neity of allelic imbalance within metastases, which 
is probably driven by aneuploidy, indicates that 
chromosomal aberrations contribute to genetic 
intratumor heterogeneity.
Intratumor Genetic Heterogeneity  
and Convergent Tumor Evolution
A comparison of genes that were mutated in this 
tumor with genes recurrently mutated in clear-cell 
carcinoma4,22 identified VHL, KDM5C, SETD2, and 
MTOR (Fig. 2B). Of these driver genes, only VHL 
was mutated ubiquitously in all analyzed regions. 
In contrast, SETD2 harbored three distinct muta-
tions with different regional distributions (Fig. 2C): 
the metastases shared a missense mutation, R4 car-
ried a splice-site mutation, and all other regions 
shared a 2-bp frameshift deletion, which was also 
detected in R4. Since SETD2 trimethylates H3K36, 
we stained several tumor regions with an antibody 
for trimethylated H3K36 to identify the conse-
quences of mutational intratumor heterogeneity on 
protein function. Trimethylated H3K36 was re-
duced in cancer cells but positive in most stromal 
cells and in a SETD2 wild-type control clear-cell 
carcinoma (Fig. 6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
These data support phenotypic convergent evolu-

Panel A shows sites of core biopsies and regions har-
vested from nephrectomy and metastasectomy speci-
mens. G indicates tumor grade. Panel B shows the 
 regional distribution of 101 nonsynonymous point 
 mutations and 32 indels in seven primary-tumor regions 
of the nephrectomy specimen (R1 through R5 and R8 
through R9), in the perinephric fat of the nephrectomy 
specimen (M1), and in two regions of the excised chest-
wall metastasis (M2a and M2b), as detected by exome 
sequencing (including the VHL mutation detected by 
Sanger sequencing). Regions R6 and R7 were excluded 
from analyses since only one nonsynonymous variant 
passed filtering. The heat map indicates the presence of a 
mutation (gray) or its absence (dark blue) in each region. 
The color bars above the heat map indicate classification 
of mutations according to whether they are ubiquitous, 
shared by primary-tumor regions, shared by metastatic 
sites, or unique to the region (private). Among the gene 
names, purple indicates that the mutation was validated, 
and orange indicates that the validation of the mutation 
failed. Because of limited DNA availability, only six muta-
tions were validated in pretreatment samples of the pri-
mary tumor (PreP) and chest-wall metastases (PreM) (in 
VHL, MTOR, SOX9, ALKBH8, SETD2, and KDM5C splice 
sites). Panel C shows phylogenetic relationships of the 
tumor regions. R4a and R4b are the subclones detected 
in R4. A question mark indicates that the detected SETD2 
splice-site mutation probably resides in R4a, whereas R4b 
most likely shares the SETD2 frameshift mutation also 
found in other primary-tumor regions. Branch lengths 
are proportional to the number of nonsynonymous mu-
tations separating the branching points. Potential driver 
mutations were acquired by the indicated genes in the 
branch (arrows). Panel D shows regional ploidy profiling 
analysis. All other primary-tumor regions were diploid 
(not shown). DI denotes DNA index of the aneuploid 
peak, indicating the DNA content as compared with a 
diploid genome.

increased staining of the downstream mTOR path-
way targets phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP. Re-
gions harboring wild-type mTOR had absent 
phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP staining in tumor 
cells (Fig. 3A). It is unlikely that everolimus would 
affect activity in the mTOR pathway in these spec-
imens, which were acquired 7 days after drug dis-
continuation (drug half-life, 30 hours).23 Transfec-
tion of complementary DNA encoding mTOR 
(L2431P) into a clear-cell carcinoma line enhanced 
phospho-S6 staining after serum starvation, indi-
cating that L2431P promotes constitutive mTOR 
activation (Fig. 3B). Transient transfection of re-
nal-cell carcinoma lines with the mutant mTOR 
construct did not affect everolimus sensitivity in 
vitro (data not shown). The mTOR sequence was 
aligned with the structurally related phosphati-
dylinositol 3 (PI3) kinase beta (Fig. 7 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). A structural model derived 
from this alignment suggests that L2431 maps to 
a hydrophobic pocket within an autoinhibitory do-
main adjacent to the activation loop. The substi-
tution of L2431 by proline may affect the confor-
mation of the mTOR activation loop. These data 
suggest that genetic intratumor heterogeneity is 
associated with functional heterogeneity of kinase 
activity.
Intratumor Heterogeneity of a Prognostic 
Signature
We determined the intratumoral expression of a 
110-gene signature shown to classify clear-cell car-
cinoma into two molecular subgroups: clear-cell 
A (associated with a good prognosis) and clear-cell 
B (associated with a poor prognosis).24 Consistent 
with the phylogenetic analysis, metastatic sites and 
the primary-tumor site R4 segregated together, en-
riched for genes in the clear-cell A subgroup, in 
contrast to the remaining tumor regions that were 
enriched for the clear-cell B subgroup (Fig. 3C). 
Thus, prognostic gene-expression signatures may 
not correctly predict outcomes if they are assessed 
from a single region of a heterogeneous tumor.
Intratumor Genetic Heterogeneity in Three 
Consecutive Tumors
To determine whether intratumor heterogeneity 
was present in consecutive clear-cell carcinomas 
from the E-PREDICT trial, we performed multire-
gion exome sequencing on the primary tumor and 
a metastasis from Patient 2 and ploidy and allelic-
imbalance profiling on primary tumors from Pa-
tients 2, 3, and 4. CT imaging showed no change in 
tumor dimensions during 6 weeks of everolimus 
treatment.
Patient 2 had a metastatic tumor with a 1-bp 
deletion in VHL. Pretreatment core biopsy samples 
contained less than 5% tumor cells and were ex-
cluded. Primary-tumor regions from R1 through 
R9 were harvested from the nephrectomy speci-
men. After 5 months of participation in the trial 
with no objective tumor response, a core biopsy 
specimen was obtained from a progressive liver 
metastasis. We performed exon-capture sequenc-
ing on tumor and germline DNA samples (median 
coverage, 61 reads) (Table 1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). R2, R5, and R8 were excluded from the 
analysis because of low variant-to-total-read ratios, 
indicating high stromal contamination. A total of 
119 somatic mutations were detected and their 
regional distribution mapped (Fig. 4A, and Table 4 
in the Supplementary Appendix). We used Sanger 
sequencing to validate somatic mutations in the 
tumor-suppressor genes VHL, PBRM1, and TP53, in 
2 independent and spatially separated mutations 
in SETD2 (missense and frameshift mutations) and 
PTEN (splice-site and missense mutations), and in 
14 of 15 randomly selected mutations (validation 
rate, 95%) (Fig. 8 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Somatic Mutational Heterogeneity
Phylogenetic analysis of tumor from Patient 2 re-
vealed a branching pattern (Fig. 4B), which was 
consistent with the findings from primary tumor 
and metastases obtained from Patient 1. Only 37% 
of the somatic mutations that were identified in 
the nephrectomy specimen were ubiquitously de-
tectable in all regions (31% if the metastasis, which 
was biopsied at the time of progression, was in-
cluded). Prolonged everolimus exposure was not as-
sociated with an increase in the number of non-
synonymous mutations in the liver metastasis, as 
compared with the nephrectomy-biopsy specimens 
(Fig. 9 in the Supplementary Appendix), further 
indicating that everolimus does not increase the 
mutational load.
There was no evidence of intratumor heteroge-
neity on ploidy profiling in primary tumor from 
Patient 2 (Fig. 10 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
However, allelic-imbalance analysis (with the ex-
ception of R8 and liver metastasis, which were 
excluded because of insufficient DNA) identified 
multiple heterogeneous chromosomal aberrations 
suggestive of intratumor heterogeneity. Allelic im-

balances on chromosomes 3p and 10q were the 
only ubiquitous aberrations (Fig. 11 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Trimethylated H3K36 staining was absent 
from tumor cells in regions with SETD2 frame-
shift or missense mutations (Fig. 12 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix), indicating that both muta-
tions together with a 3p deletion confer convergent 
loss of function. Regions with either a splice-site 
mutation or a missense mutation in PTEN, a 
negative regulator of the PI3 kinase–Akt pathway 
located on chromosome 10, showed increased 
phospho-Akt staining, as compared with PTEN 
wild-type regions (Fig. 13 in the Supplementary 
Appendix), consistent with loss of PTEN function 
and convergent phenotypic evolution.
Regional allelic-imbalance profiling of prima-
ry tumors from Patients 3 and 4 provided further 
evidence of genetic intratumor heterogeneity (Fig. 
11 in the Supplementary Appendix). Only 4 of 30 
samples from four patients had identical allelic-
imbalance profiles (tumor from Patient 3 in R1, 
R3, R4, and R9). Chromosome 3p aberrations oc-
curred ubiquitously in all regions from all tumors, 
and allelic imbalances of 10q (in tumor from Pa-
tient 2) and in 5q and 6q (in tumor from Patient 4)

Panel A shows phospho-S6 (Ser235/236) and phospho-4EBP (Thr37/46) staining. All tumor regions harboring mTOR 
(L2431P) had increased staining of the downstream mTOR-pathway targets phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP. Regions 
harboring wild-type mTOR had absent phospho-S6 and phospho-4EBP staining in tumor cells. Panel B shows immu-

orescent protein (GFP) vector alone (mock), GFP-mTOR (wild type), or GFP-mTOR (L2431P) with and without serum 
starvation. Panel C shows hierarchical clustering of samples on the basis of prognostic signature genes of two molec-
ular subgroups: clear-cell A (ccA), which indicates a good prognosis, and clear-cell B (ccB), which indicates a poor 
prognosis. The metastatic sites (M2a and M2b) and the primary-tumor site R4 segregated together, enriched for 
genes in the clear-cell A subgroup, in contrast to the remaining tumor regions that were enriched for the clear-cell B 
subgroup, showing that gene-expression signatures may not correctly predict outcomes if samples are obtained from 
a single biopsy. The brackets on the right side of the heat map (dendrogram) indicate the hierarchical clustering of 
the samples according to the expression of the analyzed genes. The z scores indicate the difference in standard devia-
tions between the mRNA expression of a gene in a sample and its mean mRNA expression across all samples.

were ubiquitously present in one case each. These 
early ubiquitous events were outnumbered by non-
ubiquitous aberrations, indicating that the majority 
of chromosomal events occurred after tumors 
diverged, providing further evidence of branching 
evolution. Ploidy profiling detected intratumor 
heterogeneity in tumor from Patient 4 (Fig. 10 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), and Sanger se-
quencing of SETD2 in Patients 3 and 4 revealed 
intratumor heterogeneity in Patient 4: seven re-
gions of tumor sharing a SETD2 frameshift muta-
tion harbored absent trimethylated H3K36 stain-
ing, whereas a single region with wild-type SETD2 
but mutant VHL harbored strong tumor-cell tri-
methylated H3K36 staining (Fig. 14 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).
Discussion
Multiregion genetic analysis of four consecutive tu-
mors provided evidence of intratumor heterogene-
ity in every tumor, with spatially separated hetero-
geneous somatic mutations and chromosomal 
imbalances leading to phenotypic intratumor diver-
sity (activating mutation in MTOR) and uniformity 
(loss-of-function mutation in SETD2 and PTEN). 
Of all somatic mutations found on multiregion se-
quencing, 63 to 69% were heterogeneous and thus 
not detectable in every sequenced region. Heteroge-
neous patterns of allelic imbalance were found in 
all tumors, and ploidy heterogeneity was found in 
two tumors. Therefore, we found that a single 
tumor-biopsy specimen reveals a minority of ge-
netic aberrations (including mutations, allelic im-
balance, and ploidy) that are present in an entire 
tumor.
Pretreatment tumor-biopsy specimens from Pa-
tient 1 had branched mutational profiles that were 
almost identical to those detected after everolimus 
exposure. Everolimus is not known to be muta-
genic, and the number of nonsynonymous muta-
tions did not increase after the administration of 
everolimus. Intratumor heterogeneity is unlikely to 
be confounded by clonal selection, since no tumor

Panel A shows the regional distribution of nonsynonymous mutations detected by exome sequencing in a heat map, with gray indicating 
the presence of a mutation and dark blue the absence of a mutation. The color bars above the heat map indicate classification of mutations 
according to whether they are ubiquitous, shared by primary-tumor regions, or unique to the region (private). For gene names, purple  
indicates that the mutation was validated, and orange indicates that the validation of the mutation failed. Panel B shows phylogenetic re-
lationships of the tumor regions. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of nonsynonymous mutations separating the branching 
points. Potential driver mutations were acquired by the indicated genes in the branch (arrows).

responses were observed during the brief preopera-
tive treatment period. Since intratumor heteroge-
neity preceded therapy, it is unlikely that treatment 
biased the interpretation of these analyses.
An unexpected finding was the detection of 
spatially separated distinct somatic mutations 
affecting the histone H3K36 methyltransferase 
SETD2, the histone H3K4 demethylase KDM5C, 
and the negative regulator of the PI3 kinase–Akt 
pathway, PTEN. Despite genetic divergence during 
tumor progression, phenotypic convergent evolu-
tion occurs, indicating a high degree of mutational 
diversity, a substrate for Darwinian selection, and 
evolutionary adaptation.
The heterogeneous MTOR mutation renders the 
kinase constitutively active, increasing S6 phos-
phorylation, a potential biomarker of response to 
mTOR inhibitors in clear-cell carcinoma.25 Such 
spatially separated somatic mutations altering 
pathway activity suggest that multiregional anal-
yses may be required to predict the therapeutic 
outcome. Further studies will assess whether acti-
vating mutations in MTOR depend on this pathway, 
which may result in higher responsiveness to 
mTOR inhibition.
Intratumor heterogeneity was evident at the 
RNA-expression level, with expression signatures 
of good or poor prognosis detected in different 
regions of the same tumor. Although the 7-day 
washout period minimized a direct influence of 
everolimus on prognostic signature expression, we 
cannot exclude the possibility that potential 
unknown and persistent effects of everolimus 
pretreatment on the tumor–stroma composition 
might alter mRNA expression. The prognostic 
signature was described to be independent of 
metastatic stage,24 consistent with the occur-
rence of the good prognostic signature in metas-
tases.
Branched tumor evolution underscores the im-
portance of targeting ubiquitous alterations in the 
trunk of the phylogenetic tree. Such ubiquitous 
allelic-imbalance events were seen on chromosome 
3p (encoding VHL, PBRM1, and SETD2), 5q, 6q, and 
10q. Larger multiregional series will probably iden-
tify genes that can be targeted in the trunks of 
the phylogenetic tree for clear-cell carcinoma. 
Intratumor heterogeneity within the primary tu-
mor may account for the benefits associated with 
cytoreductive nephrectomy26-28 by eliminating an 
evolutionary reservoir of phenotypic tumor-cell 
diversity.
Genomics analyses from single tumor-biopsy 
specimens may underestimate the mutational bur-
den of heterogeneous tumors. Intratumor hetero-
geneity may explain the difficulties encountered in 
the validation of oncology biomarkers owing to 
sampling bias,29 contribute to Darwinian selec-
tion of preexisting drug-resistant clones,12,30 and 
predict therapeutic resistance.13 Reconstructing 
tumor clonal architectures and the identification 
of common mutations located in the trunk of the 
phylogenetic tree may contribute to more robust 
biomarkers and therapeutic approaches.
