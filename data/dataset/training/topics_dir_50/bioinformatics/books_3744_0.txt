Shameless Cross-Promotion
● Looking into the past with statistical models
● This is what we do, e.g., reconstruct evolutionary 
history of species
● Looking into the future with statistical models
● That's what Prof. Tilman Gneiting also KIT and HITS, 
Heidelberg does, e.g., weather prediction 
● Course on spatial statistics 
● We are looking to supervise Bachelor and 
Master's theses together 
  
Knowledge Check
● Please complete the knowledge check
● There are three parts:
I. HPC background
II.Algorithms Background 
III. Biology Background
● Just to see where we are
● If there are not enough copies complete the 
questionnaire with your neighbor
  
Knowledge Check Courses
● If you are interested to learn more, we recommend the following courses:
● Biology
● Either "Ergänzungsfach Genetik" or single lectures thereof:
–  Grundlagen der Biologie (WS): introduction to molecular biology, no background required!
–  Molekularbiologie (WS): widely used molecular wet lab methods: cloning, DNA sequencing, PCR etc
–  Genetik (WS): in-depth discussion of replication/transcription/translation machinery
● These courses are taught to biology bachelors (1st-2nd year), but can also be attend by 
CS students without problem
● Computer Science
● Algorithm Engineering (SS): how to make algorithms run fast in practice
● Multikern-Rechner und Rechnerbündel (WS): multi-threading concepts, OpenMP, MPI
● Praxis der Multikern-Programmierung (WS/SS): putting the above into practice
● Praktikum: GPU-Computing (WS/SS): CUDA/OpenCL 
  
Teaching plan
● The current plan is to teach this course together 
with my PhD students & PostDocs
● This may lead to inconsistencies in language 
quality & presentation style, that is, a lack of 
continuity and consistency
● If it does not work, please let me know and I will 
take over → the students rather enjoyed it last 
time
● However, except for the lecture on May 8, I will 
always be there!

Main Research Focus
  
What is Bioinformatics?
● Term introduced by P. Hogeweg & B. Hesper in 1970 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulien_Hogeweg 
● There are many definitions
● I will provide my own:
● In bioinformatics we intend to develop, optimize, and parallelize algorithms, models, 
and production-level software for analyzing, storing, and extracting knowledge from, 
biological raw data.
● Key differences to CS
– proof-of-concept implementations are not sufficient
– we need to produce code that can be used by biologists
– we need to provide support for the code
– have a look at http://groups.google.com/group/raxml 
– Most famous Bioinformaticians are known for one or more widely-used and highly cited 
algorithms & tools they have developed
● “Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on” – Donald 
Knuth 
  
The ideal Bioinformatics tool
What is my hypothesis?
  
What is Bioinformatics?
        BiologyCS
Bioinformatics
  
Why is this exciting?
        BiologyCS
Important problems → medical applications,
Infectious diseases, genetic defects etc.
Masses of data → storage and analysis challenges
HPC → increased need for parallel codes 
  
What are the challenges?
        BiologyCS
We can't be experts in everything → interdisciplinary collaboration 
We need a culture of asking questions when we don't understand a term/concept!
  
Disciplines involved
        BiologyCS
Numerics
Statistics
Discrete Algorithms
Algorithm Engineering
Parallel Computing
Supercomputing
Software Engineering (in practice)
  
What is Biological Raw Data?
● There are many types of biological raw data
● Images from microscopes
● Microarray data
● Protein structure data
● Morphological data
● Ecological data
● Biogeographical data
● …
● In this course we will mainly focus on classic 
Bioinformatics, that is, the analysis of molecular 
sequence data (DNA, protein data)
  
DNA data
● DNA data is available in public databases
● The most well-known one is GenBank
● Maintained by NCBI: National Center for Biotechnology Information, US
● Other databases for DNA data: EMBL (EU), DDBJ (Japan)
# of sequences
# of nucleotides/
base pairs
  
DNA data
● Genetic sequence
● Alphabet of 4 basic characters (nucleotides): 
● Adenine
● Cytosine
● Guanine
● Thymine
● A DNA sequence: AACGTTTGA 
● This sequence has 9 base pairs/nucleotides
● In RNA data: T is replaced by Uracil
● A RNA sequence: AACGUUUGA
● We will see what RNA is later
● If we use T or U does usually not matter, computationally
  
Extended DNA alphabet
● DNA sequencing techniques are not exact
● Need to extend character set to denote: 
● could be an A or C
● could be an A or C or G
● ...
● International Union for Pure and Applied 
Chemistry (IUPAC) encoding
  
Ambiguity Code
  
Ambiguity Code
We will talk about this
later!
  
DNA Sequencing
● The process of reading the nucleotide bases in 
a DNA molecule
● There exist various sequencing technologies
● Properties
● Cost
● Speed
● Amount of data/Number of Sequences
● Sequence length
● Error rate
  
DNA Sequencing
● Sanger sequencing (since 1977)
● High accuracy: 99.9%
● Long sequences: 300-900 nucleotides
● Expensive:  $2400 per 1,000,000 nucleotides
● Few sequences: up to ≈ 100
● Next-generation sequencing (around 2007/2008)
● Lower accuracy 98-99.9%
● Short sequences (100-400 nucleotides)
● Inexpensive $1 - $10 per 1,000,000 nucleotides
● Many sequences: 500 – 3,000,000,000 per sequencer run

This is a revolution!
We will see how this data can be 
used and analyzed in this course!
  
The revolution
Sequencing cost versus processing cost!
  
The revolution
Sequencing cost versus processing cost!
There is a lot of work to do for 
computer scientists to keep up with the data!
These are exciting times!
  
Remember
● Back in 2001 the complete sequencing of the 
human genome made the news!
● Papers appeared in Science & Nature
● Now it's almost boring: aha, somebody 
sequenced yet another genome
● Our lab
● Evolutionary analysis of 50 bird genomes
● Evolutionary analysis of 1000 insect transcriptomes 
→ we will see what a transcriptome is later
  
DNA data
● GenBank: most-sequenced species
  
DNA data
● GenBank: most-sequenced species
Some of these species are so-called model organisms
  
Model Organism
● A species that is extensively studied/sequenced to understand particular 
biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made for 
the model organism will provide insight into the workings of other 
organisms.
● Selection criteria: 
● easy experimental manipulation
● ease of genetic manipulation
● easy to grow
→ short life-cycle/generation times 
● easy to extract DNA data
● Economical importance → rice
● Often researchers reverse-engineer organisms
● Full list of model organisms: 
http://www.life.umd.edu/labs/mount/Models.html 
  
Some Model Organisms
● Escheria coli
gut bacterium → can cause 
food poisoning, grows fast, 
inexpensive to cultivate
● Drosophila Melanogaster
fruit fly → breeds quickly
● Arabidopsis Thaliana
flowering plant →  small 
genome 
  
Back to DNA
● What's a base pair?
● Pairing of A with T or C with G in double-
stranded DNA
AATTGGC
TTAACCG
complement
  
Sloppy terminology
● The # of base pairs is frequently used as synonym 
for the # of nucleotides in a single-strand sequence
● This sequence has 5 nucleotides: ACGGT
● We can also say that it has 5 base pairs
● As in CS we use kilo, giga, etc for sequence lengths
● kb → kilo-bases
● Mb → Mega-bases
● Gb → Giga-bases
  
Genome
● The full genetic information of an organism
● Contains all chromosomes
● Comprises the coding & non-coding sequence data of 
the organism
● Coding sequence data → part of the genome that 
encodes proteins
● Non-coding (in earlier days: junk) DNA → part of the 
genome that does not encode proteins but still has a 
function
– The function of non-coding DNA is only partially known
– Non-coding DNA regulates protein processes 
  
Genome Size
● Not necessarily correlated with organism complexity
● Homo Sapiens: 3.2 Gb (Giga-bases)
● Marbled lungfish: 130 Gb (Giga-bases)
● Plants often have very large genomes → partially due to 
redundant information.
