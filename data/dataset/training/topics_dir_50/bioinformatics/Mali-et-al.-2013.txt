Bacteria and archaea have evolved adaptive immune defenses, termed clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) systems, that use short
RNA to direct degradation of foreign nucleic acids. Here, we engineer the type II bacterial CRISPR
system to function with custom guide RNA (gRNA) in human cells. For the endogenous AAVS1
locus, we obtained targeting rates of 10 to 25% in 293T cells, 13 to 8% in K562 cells, and 2 to
4% in induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that this process relies on CRISPR components;
is sequence-specific; and, upon simultaneous introduction of multiple gRNAs, can effect multiplex
editing of target loci. We also compute a genome-wide resource of ~190 K unique gRNAs
targeting ~40.5% of human exons. Our results establish an RNA-guided editing tool for facile,
robust, and multiplexable human genome engineering.
Bacterial and archaeal clustered regular-ly interspaced short palindromic repeats(CRISPR) systems rely on CRISPR RNAs
(crRNAs) in complex with CRISPR-associated
(Cas) proteins to direct degradation of comple-
mentary sequences present within invading viral
and plasmid DNA (1–3). A recent in vitro re-
constitution of the Streptococcus pyogenes type
II CRISPR system demonstrated that crRNA fused
to a normally trans-encoded tracrRNA is sufficient
to direct Cas9 protein to sequence-specifically
cleave target DNA sequencesmatching the crRNA
(4). The fully defined nature of this two-component
system suggested that it might function in the
cells of eukaryotic organisms such as yeast, plants,
and even mammals. By cleaving genomic se-
quences targeted by RNA sequences (4–6), such
a system could greatly enhance the ease of genome
engineering.
Here, we engineer the protein and RNA com-
ponents of this bacterial type II CRISPR system
in human cells. We began by synthesizing a hu-
man codon–optimized version of the Cas9 protein
bearing a C-terminal SV40 nuclear localization
signal and cloning it into a mammalian expres-
sion system (Fig. 1A and fig. S1A). To direct Cas9
to cleave sequences of interest, we expressed
crRNA-tracrRNA fusion transcripts, hereafter
referred to as guide RNAs (gRNAs), from the
human U6 polymerase III promoter. Directly
transcribing gRNAs allowed us to avoid recon-
stituting the RNA-processing machinery used by
bacterial CRISPR systems (Fig. 1A and fig. S1B)
(4, 7–9). Constrained only by U6 transcription
initiating with G and the requirement for the PAM
(protospacer-adjacent motif) sequence -NGG fol-
lowing the 20–base pair (bp) crRNA target, our
highly versatile approach can, in principle, tar-
get any genomic site of the form GN20GG (fig.
S1C; see supplementary text S1 for a detailed
discussion).
To test the functionality of our implemen-
tation for genome engineering, we developed a
green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter assay
(Fig. 1B) in human embryonic kidney HEK 293T
cells similar to one previously described (10).
Specifically, we established a stable cell line bear-
ing a genomically integrated GFP coding sequence
disrupted by the insertion of a stop codon and a
68-bp genomic fragment from the AAVS1 locus
that renders the expressed protein fragment non-
fluorescent. Homologous recombination (HR)
using an appropriate repair donor can restore the
normal GFP sequence, which enabled us to quan-
tify the resulting GFP+ cells by flow-activated
cell sorting (FACS).
To test the efficiency of our system at stim-
ulating HR, we constructed two gRNAs, T1 and
T2, that target the intervening AAVS1 fragment
(Fig. 1B) and compared their activity to that of a
previously described TAL effector nuclease het-
erodimer (TALEN) targeting the same region
(11). We observed successful HR events using all
three targeting reagents, with gene correction rates
using the T1 and T2 gRNAs approaching 3% and
8%, respectively (Fig. 1C). This RNA-mediated
editing process was notably rapid, with the first
detectable GFP+ cells appearing ~20 hours post
transfection compared with ~40 hours for the
AAVS1 TALENs. We observed HR only upon
simultaneous introduction of the repair donor,
Cas9 protein, and gRNA, which confirmed that
all components are required for genome editing
(fig. S2). Although we noted no apparent toxic-
ity associated with Cas9/gRNA expression, work
with zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TALENs
has shown that nicking only one strand further
reduces toxicity. Accordingly, we also tested a
Cas9D10A mutant that is known to function as
a nickase in vitro, which yielded similar HR but
lower nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) rates
(fig. S3) (4, 5). Consistent with (4), in which a
related Cas9 protein is shown to cut both strands

3 bp upstream of the PAM, our NHEJ data con-
firmed that most deletions or insertions occurred
at the 3′ end of the target sequence (fig. S3B).
We also confirmed that mutating the target ge-
nomic site prevents the gRNA from effecting HR
at that locus, which demonstrates that CRISPR-
mediated genome editing is sequence-specific
(fig. S4). Finally, we showed that two gRNAs
targeting sites in the GFP gene, and also three
additional gRNAs targeting fragments from ho-
mologous regions of the DNA methyl transfer-
ase 3a (DNMT3a) and DNMT3b genes could
sequence-specifically induce significant HR in
the engineered reporter cell lines (figs. S5 and
S6). Together, these results confirm that RNA-
guided genome targeting in human cells is simple
to execute and induces robust HR across multiple
target sites.
Having successfully targeted an integrated re-
porter, we next turned to modifying a native lo-
cus. We used the gRNAs described above to
target theAAVS1 locus located in the PPP1R12C
gene on chromosome 19, which is ubiquitously
expressed across most tissues (Fig. 2A). We tar-
geted 293Ts, human chronic myelogenous leu-
kemia K562 cells, and PGP1 human induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (12) and analyzed
the results by next-generation sequencing of the
targeted locus. Consistent with our results for
the GFP reporter assay, we observed high num-
bers of NHEJ events at the endogenous locus
for all three cell types. The two gRNAs T1 and
T2 achievedNHEJ rates of 10 and 25% in 293Ts,
13 and 38% in K562s, and 2 and 4% in PGP1-
iPS cells, respectively (Fig. 2B). We observed
no overt toxicity from the Cas9 and gRNA ex-
pression required to induce NHEJ in any of these
cell types. As expected, NHEJ-mediated deletions
for T1 and T2 were centered around the target site
positions, which further validated the sequence-
specificity of this targeting process (figs. S7 to
S9). Simultaneous introduction of both T1 and
T2 gRNAs resulted in high-efficiency deletion of
the intervening 19-bp fragment (fig. S8), which
demonstrated that multiplexed editing of genomic
loci is feasible using this approach.
Last, we attempted to use HR to integrate
either a double-stranded DNA donor construct
(13) or an oligo donor into the native AAVS1
locus (Fig. 2C and fig. S10). We confirmed HR-
mediated integration, using both approaches,
by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fig. 2D
and fig. S10) and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2E).
We also readily derived 293T or iPS clones
from the pool of modified cells using puromycin
selection over 2 weeks (Fig. 2F and fig. S10).
These results demonstrate that this approach en-
ables efficient integration of foreign DNA at en-
dogenous loci in human cells.
Our versatile RNA-guided genome-editing
system can be readily adapted to modify other
genomic sites by simply modifying the sequence
of our gRNA expression vector to match a com-
patible sequence in the locus of interest. To facil-
itate this process, we bioinformatically generated
~190,000 specific gRNA-targetable sequences

Cas9 unwinds the DNA duplex and cleaves both strands upon recognition
of a target sequence by the gRNA, but only if the correct PAM is present at

targeting ~40.5% exons of genes in the human
genome (refer to methods and table S1). We also
incorporated these target sequences into a 200-bp
format compatible with multiplex synthesis on
DNA arrays (14) (fig. S11 and tables S2 and S3).
This resource provides a ready genome-wide
reference of potential target sites in the human
genome and a methodology for multiplex gRNA
synthesis.
Our results demonstrate the promise of
CRISPR-mediated gene targeting for RNA-
guided, robust, and multiplexable mammalian
genome engineering. The ease of retargeting our
system to modify genomic sequences greatly ex-
ceeds that of comparable ZFNs and TALENs,
while offering similar or greater efficiencies (4).
Existing studies of type II CRISPR specificity (4)
suggest that target sites must perfectly match
the PAM sequence NGG and the 8- to 12-base
“seed sequence” at the 3′ end of the gRNA. The
importance of the remaining 8 to 12 bases is less
well understood and may depend on the binding
strength of the matching gRNAs or on the in-
herent tolerance of Cas9 itself. Indeed, Cas9 will
tolerate single mismatches at the 5′ end in bacte-
ria and in vitro, which suggests that the 5′ G is
not required. Moreover, it is likely that the tar-
get locus’s underlying chromatin structure and
epigenetic state will also affect the efficiency of
genome editing in eukaryotic cells (13), although
we suspect that Cas9’s helicase activity may
render it more robust to these factors, but this
remains to be evaluated. Elucidating the fre-
quency and underlying causes of off-target nu-
clease activity (15, 16) induced by CRISPR, ZFN

tools will be of utmost importance for safe ge-
nome modification and perhaps for gene ther-
apy. Potential avenues for improving CRISPR
specificity include evaluating Cas9 homologs
identified through bioinformatics and directed
evolution of these nucleases toward higher spec-
ificity. Similarly, the range of CRISPR-targetable
sequences could be expanded through the use
of homologs with different PAM requirements
(9) or by directed evolution. Finally, inactivating
one of the Cas9 nuclease domains increases the
ratio of HR to NHEJ and may reduce toxicity
(figs. S1A and fig. S3) (4, 5), whereas inactivat-
ing both domains may enable Cas9 to function as
a retargetable DNA binding protein. As we ex-
plore these areas, we note that another parallel
study (21) has independently confirmed the high
efficiency of CRISPR-mediated gene targeting
in mammalian cell lines. We expect that RNA-
guided genome targeting will have broad impli-
cations for synthetic biology (22, 23), the direct
and multiplexed perturbation of gene networks
(13, 24), and targeted ex vivo (25–27) and in vivo
gene therapy (28).

Cyclic GMP-AMP Is an Endogenous
Second Messenger in Innate Immune
Signaling by Cytosolic DNA
Jiaxi Wu,1* Lijun Sun,1,2* Xiang Chen,1 Fenghe Du,1 Heping Shi,3 Chuo Chen,3 Zhijian J. Chen1,2†
Cytosolic DNA induces type I interferons and other cytokines that are important for antimicrobial
defense but can also result in autoimmunity. This DNA signaling pathway requires the adaptor
protein STING and the transcription factor IRF3, but the mechanism of DNA sensing is unclear. We
found that mammalian cytosolic extracts synthesized cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine
monophosphate (cyclic GMP-AMP, or cGAMP) in vitro from adenosine triphosphate and guanosine
triphosphate in the presence of DNA but not RNA. DNA transfection or DNA virus infection of
mammalian cells also triggered cGAMP production. cGAMP bound to STING, leading to the
activation of IRF3 and induction of interferon-b. Thus, cGAMP in metazoans and functions
as an endogenous second messenger that triggers interferon production in response to
cytosolic DNA.
Host defense against foreign genetic ele-ments is one of the most fundamentalfunctions of a living organism. The pres-
ence of self or foreign DNA in the cytoplasm is
sensed by eukaryotic cells as a danger signal or a
sign of foreign invasion (1). DNA can be intro-
duced into the cytoplasm by bacterial or viral
infection, transfection, or “leakage” from the nu-
cleus or mitochondria under some pathological
conditions that cause autoimmune diseases such
as lupus. In mammalian cells, cytosolic DNA
triggers the production of type I interferons and
other cytokines through the endoplasmic re-
ticulum protein STING (also known as MITA,
MPYS, or ERIS) (2). STING recruits and acti-
vates the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1, which
activate the transcription factors NF-kB and
IRF3, respectively. NF-kB and IRF3 then enter
the nucleus and function together to induce in-
terferons and other cytokines. DNA-dependent
RNA polymerase III has been shown to be a
sensor that detects and transcribes AT-rich DNAs
such as poly(deoxyadenosine-deoxythymidine)
[poly(dA:dT)] into an RNA ligand capable of
stimulating the RIG-I pathway to induce inter-
ferons (3, 4). However, most DNA sequences do
not activate the RNA polymerase III–RIG-I path-
way. Instead, cytosolic DNA activates the STING-
dependent pathway in a sequence-independent
manner. How cytosolic DNA activates the STING
pathway remains elusive.
We hypothesized that DNA binds to and acti-
vates a putative cytosolic DNA sensor, which
then directly or indirectly activates STING, leading
to the activation of IRF3 and NF-kB (fig. S1A).
To test this model, we developed an in vitro com-
plementation assay using the murine fibrosarcoma
cell line L929, which is known to induce
interferon-b (IFN-b) in a STING-dependent man-
ner (5) (Fig. 1A). We used an L929 cell line
stably expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA)
against STING such that DNA transfection would
only activate factors upstream of STING, includ-
ing the putative DNA sensor (fig. S1, A and B).
The L929-shSTING cells were transfected with
different types of DNA, and then cytoplasmic
extracts from these cells were mixed with the
human monocytic cell line THP1 or murine mac-
rophage cell line Raw264.7, which was permea-
bilizedwith perfringolysinO (PFO; Fig. 1A). PFO
treatment pokes holes in the plasma membrane
(6), allowing the cytoplasm to diffuse in and
out of cells, while retaining organelles includ-
ing the endoplasmic reticulum (which contains
STING) and the Golgi apparatus inside the cells
(7). If an upstream activator of STING is gen-
erated in the DNA-transfected cells, the cyto-
plasm containing such an activator is expected
to activate STING in the PFO-permeabilized
cells, leading to the phosphorylation and dimer-
ization of IRF3.
Cytoplasmic extracts from L929-shSTING
cells transfected with a DNA sequence known
as interferon-stimulatory DNA (ISD; Fig. 1B,
lane 2), poly(dA:dT), a GC-rich 50–base pair
