Abstract
A new method for structural physical parameter identification is proposed for linear structure. Firstly, a linear structural
identification model was obtained based on a series of transformation of the dynamic characteristic equation. Then the posterior
distribution of the model is obtained by the Bayesian updating theory. Using the structural modal parameters and considering their
randomness, the structural stiffness parameter is obtained from the conditional posterior distribution of the linear structural
identification model. The Gibbs sampling based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed during the
process. In order to illustrate the proposed method, a 3-DOF linear shear building is used as an example to detect and quantify its
damage based on model data measured before and after a severe loading event. The research shows that damage level and
locations can be identified with little error by using proposed method.

1 INTRODUCTION
In recent years, the problem of structural physical parameters identification for a system has attracted the attention of
many researchers, Gong and Li[1] adopted Bayesian statistics theory and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sample method to estimate the structural physical parameters, Yuen and Mu[2] proposed a novel Bayesian real-time
system identification algorithm using response measurement for dynamical systems. But under the influence of
uncertain factors, such as non-uniformity in material properties, variability in complex constitutive behavior
and randomness in the excitations, uncertainty becomes the essential characteristic of measurement data and
structural analysis model, which makes structural physical parameter identification an indeterminate problem[3].
So new approaches capable of identifying structural physical parameters from a probabilistic point of view are
needed. Considering the uncertainties, Ito and Kogiso[4] adopted the Reliability-based design optimization(RBDO)
method to estimate the parameters.
In the field of civil engineering, Beck and Katafygiotis[5] proposed a Bayesian structural model updating approach at
first, but the amount of modal data must be sufficiently large. Beck and Au[6] proposed a stochastic simulation
approach to overcome this problem, based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Metropolis-Hastings).
However, a major limitation is that it is only efficient for lower-dimensional problems. Ching and Cheng[7] proposed
the transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) algorithm to overcome this limitation, while the Markov
chains must “burn-in” a sufficiently long time. The Gibbs sampling can solve high-dimensional model updating
problems effectively[8], Li and Xie[3] adopted this approach to identify structural physical parameters using certain
modal data, but due to the environmental impact, test error and the simplified analytical process, the uncertainties
exist inevitably between the measured modal parameters and the true values[9].
In this paper, a new structural physical parameters identification approach is presented for linear structural models.
At first, a linear structural identification model was obtained based on a series of transformation of the dynamic

characteristic equation. Then the posterior distribution of the model is obtained by the Bayesian updating theory.
Using the structural modal parameters and considering their randomness, the structural stiffness parameter is
obtained from the conditional posterior distribution of the linear structural identification model. The Gibbs sampling
based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is employed during the process.
2 THE LINEAR REGRESSIONMODEL
The linear regression model is generally represented as follows [10] (Scott, 2007):
 Y X e (1)
e～ 2(0, ) eN I (2)
where iy is equal to a linear combination of a set of predictors, i
TX  plus error ie , and that the error term is normally
distributed with a mean of 0 and some variance 2e ,and I is an n-dimensional identity matrix. The diagonal
elements of this matrix are all equal, and the off-diagonal elements of this matrix are 0s.
A Bayesian specification typically begins with a normality assumption on |y x (often with the conditioning
suppressed): iy ～
2( , )
i
T
eN X   . And an improper uniform prior over the real line is often specified for the regression
parameters , namely:
( ) 1iP   ( (0, ); 1, 2, )i i m     (3)
The prior probability distribution function (PDF) for 2e is taken to be the product of independent inverse gamma
PDFs,
2( )eP  ～ ( , )IG  
2( / )2 1(1/ )    ee e (4)
When 0   , the inverse gamma prior becomes the usual Jeffreys’ non-informative prior, i.e.,
2( )eP  ～
21/ e (5)
This yields a posterior distribution that appears as:
2 2 ( /2 1)

1( , | , ) ( ) exp ( ) ( )

(6)
A Gibbs sampler for the linear regression model can be developed when the full conditional posterior distribution of
 and 2e is known. The full conditional posterior distribution for
2
e is straightforward to derive from Eq. (6):
2 2 ( /2 1)

This conditional posterior is easily seen to be an inverse gamma distribution with parameters
/ 2  n and ( ) ( ) / 2    TY X Y X .While the conditional posterior distribution for  is:
2 2 ( /2 1) 1

It can be recognized that the conditional posterior distribution for  is normal with a mean equal to
1( ) ( )T TX X X Y and a variance of 2 1( )Te X X

3 LINEAR STRUCTURAL IDENTIFICATIONMODEL
n terms of structural health monitoring, linear structural models are often used for model updating, since much
vibration data of structures under investigation are obtained using low-amplitude excitation, such as ambient
vibration and hammer. In this case, many structures (even damaged nonlinear structures) behave approximately
linearly, so the linearity assumption of the approach is justified [8].

from 0 to 1. The i th structural member can be judged to be damaged when 1i  , and the damage degree can be
seen through the value of i . Note that the mass of the structural members are fixed values since it is less sensitive to
the damage. If there is a need to identify the mass parameters, a similar transform to equation (9) will do.

4 GIBBS SAMPLER ALGORITHM
 Draw the initial sample  (0) 2(0)ˆ ˆ, e  from the prior PDFs and let 1k  ;
 According to Eq. (7)and(11), sample the error term 2( )ˆ ke ～ 2 1ˆ( | , , )keP X Y 
 ;
 According to Eq. (8)and(11), sample the structural stiffness parameters
( )k ～ 2( )ˆ( | , , )keP X Y  ;
 Let 1k k  , go back to step two and cycle to obtain N samples ( ) 2( )ˆ ˆ, : 1, 2, ,k ke k N    .
When k gets large enough, the samples  ( ) 2( )ˆ ˆ,k ke  will follow the PDF 2( , | , )eP X Y  .
5 DAMAGE PROBABILITY EVALUATION
Since a one to one correspondence exists between the elements of structural stiffness parameters vector  and the
components of the structure, so in this paper, the damage will be defined as a reduction in the value of any element
of the structural stiffness parameters vector  below some specified threshold value. And estimated the damage
probability will be defined to be that any element of the structural stiffness parameters vector has decreased more
than a fraction d .

Note that the samples  ( ) 2( )ˆ ˆ,k ke  will ultimately distribute as 2( , | , )eP X Y  , implying that the extracted stiffness
samples  ( )ˆ : 1, 2, ,k k N   will ultimately distribute as ( | , )P X Y .
After sampling from both the undamaged and damaged structures, the damage probability may be approximated
using M comparisons between the values of samples generated from the two sets of data, as follows(M uto,2006):

(12)
where I[.] is the indicator function, which is unity when the condition is satisfied and zero otherwise, the samples
ˆud
in and ˆ
pd
in are chosen randomly from the available samples conditioned on the undamaged and possibly damaged
data, respectively. AndM is the sample size after the “burn-in” period. In order to make the results accurate enough,
M needs to a large integer. In this paper the “burn-in” period is taken to be 1000, andM is chosen to be 4000.
6 NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
To examine the performance of the Gibbs sampler algorithm, studies are performed using simulated data from a 3-
DOF linear shear structure, in which the height, mass and stiffness are chosen to be h1=5m, h2=h3=4m; m1=2000kg,
m2=1500kg, m3=1000kg; k1=1800kN/m, k2=1200kN/m, k3=600kN/m. Damage is simulated by reducing the
column stiffness, as shown in Fig.1. There are three damage patterns in this paper: (1) DP1: loss of 30% column
stiffness in the first floor; (2) DP2: loss of 30% column stiffness in the second floor and loss of 50% column stiffness
in the top floor; (3) DP3: the losses of column stiffness in the first, second and top floor are 50%, 40%, 30%,
respectively. In order to take the randomness of the modal parameters into consideration, in this paper, the first-order
natural frequency used during the Gibbs sampling process is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean
taken to be the theory natural frequency value and proper variance, as shown in Table 1.
m1=2000kg
m2=1500kg
m3=1000kg
k3=600KN/m
k2=1200KN/m
k1=1800KN/m

FIG.1 THE 3-DOF LINEAR SHEAR STRUCTURE

Mean of 1 (rad/s） 14.51 13.30 12.34 10.91
Variance of 1 1.02 1.06 1.17 0.93
For simplicity, the initial samples of the structural stiffness parameters vector  of the four patterns are all taken to
be [0.8 0.8 0.8]  T . Following the Gibbs sampler algorithm, the Markov chain samples of the structural
stiffness parameters are obtained. In Fig.2, all the samples of 1 for the undamaged and damaged case are plotted (to
save space, the samples of 2 and are omitted). Fig.2 shows clearly that when any structural component was
damaged, the corresponding Markov chain samples curve will change obviously, making it easy to locate the
damage position and identify the degree of damage.
In Fig.3 the Markov chain samples in different parameter space for all damaged patterns are plotted. The results
show approximate linearity for the relations between different parameters, which imply that the results are
reasonable. It is also very easy to locate the damage position and identify the degree of damage from Fig.3. For
example, in Fig.3.1, compare with the curve marked with “o” (UD), the curve marked with “+” (DP1) shifts

distinctly to the left ( 1 direction) while there is almost no shift in 2 direction. This implies that there is a loss of
stiffness in the column 1k and there is no damage in column 2k , just be consistent with the damage condition we
assumed before. It should be noticed that the curve marked with “o” (UD) and the curve marked with “+”(DP1)
overlap closely in Fig.3.3, this is because that Fig.3.3 is plotted in the 2 3( , )  space while in DP1there is no damage
assumed in 2k and 3k .

Fig.4 shows the probability that the loss of stiffness of different columns exceeds the threshold d for different
damaged patterns, estimated using Eq. (12). Through this approach, it cannot just locate the damage position and
identify the degree of damage clearly, but update the associated uncertainties, just the advantages of Bayesian
techniques.

Table 2 shows the posterior statistical properties of the stiffness parameters. Since only the first-order natural
frequency is used and the uncertainties in the natural frequency data, when the degree of damage increases, the error
of identified results also increases slightly, but within an acceptable range.
7 CONCLUSION
A new structural physical parameters identification approach is presented for linear structural models. The results
from the simulated 3-DOF linear shear building show that the proposed approach can not only identify the damage

degree and locations in different ways with little error, but also inherits the advantages of Bayesian techniques: it
updates both the optimal estimate of the structural parameters and the associated uncertainties.
