Editor’s Note: This is a milestone article that deserves careful study. Connectivism should not be con
fused with constructivism. George Siemens advances a theory of learning that is consistent with the
needs of the twenty first century. His theory takes into account trends in learning, the use of technology
and networks, and the diminishing half-life of knowledge. It combines relevant elements of many
learning theories, social structures, and technology to create a powerful theoretical construct for
learning in the digital age.
Connectivism:
A Learning Theory for the Digital Age
George Siemens
Introduction
Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism are the three broad learning theories most
often utilized in the creation of instructional environments. These theories, however,
were developed in a time when learning was not impacted through technology. Over the
last twenty years, technology has reorganized how we live, how we communicate, and
how we learn. Learning needs and theories that describe learning principles and
processes, should be reflective of underlying social environments. Vaill emphasizes that
“learning must be a way of being – an ongoing set of attitudes and actions by
individuals and groups that they employ to try to keep abreast of the surprising, novel,
messy, obtrusive, recurring events…” (1996, p.42).
Learners as little as forty years ago would complete the required schooling and enter a
career that would often last a lifetime. Information development was slow. The life of
knowledge was measured in decades. Today, these foundational principles have been
altered. Knowledge is growing exponentially. In many fields the life of knowledge is now
measured in months and years. Gonzalez (2004) describes the challenges of rapidly
diminishing knowledge life:
“One of the most persuasive factors is the shrinking half-life of knowledge. The “half-life of
knowledge” is the time span from when knowledge is gained to when it becomes obsolete.
Half of what is known today was not known 10 years ago. The amount of knowledge in the
world has doubled in the past 10 years and is doubling every 18 months according to the
American Society of Training and Documentation (ASTD). To combat the shrinking half-life
of knowledge, organizations have been forced to develop new methods of deploying
instruction.”
Some significant trends in learning:
Many learners will move into a variety of different, possibly unrelated fields over the
course of their lifetime.
Informal learning is a significant aspect of our learning experience. Formal education
no longer comprises the majority of our learning. Learning now occurs in a variety of
ways – through communities of practice, personal networks, and through completion
of work-related tasks.
Learning is a continual process, lasting for a lifetime. Learning and work related

activities are no longer separate. In many situations, they are the same.
Technology is altering (rewiring) our brains. The tools we use define and shape our
thinking.
The organization and the individual are both learning organisms. Increased attention
to knowledge management highlights the need for a theory that attempts to explain
the link between individual and organizational learning.
Many of the processes previously handled by learning theories (especially in
cognitive information processing) can now be off-loaded to, or supported by,
technology.
Know-how and know-what is being supplemented with know-where (the
understanding of where to find knowledge needed).
Background
Driscoll (2000) defines learning as “a persisting change in human performance or
performance potential…[which] must come about as a result of the learner’s experience
and interaction with the world” (p.11). This definition encompasses many of the
attributes commonly associated with behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism –
namely, learning as a lasting changed state (emotional, mental, physiological (i.e.
skills)) brought about as a result of experiences and interactions with content or other
people.
Driscoll (2000, p14-17) explores some of the complexities of defining learning. Debate
centers on:
Valid sources of knowledge - Do we gain knowledge through experiences? Is it
innate (present at birth)? Do we acquire it through thinking and reasoning?
Content of knowledge – Is knowledge actually knowable? Is it directly knowable
through human experience?
The final consideration focuses on three epistemological traditions in relation to
learning: Objectivism, Pragmatism, and Interpretivism
Objectivism (similar to behaviorism) states that reality is external and is
objective, and knowledge is gained through experiences.
Pragmatism (similar to cognitivism) states that reality is interpreted, and
knowledge is negotiated through experience and thinking.
Interpretivism (similar to constructivism) states that reality is internal, and
knowledge is constructed.
All of these learning theories hold the notion that knowledge is an objective (or a state)
that is attainable (if not already innate) through either reasoning or experiences.
Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism (built on the epistemological traditions)
attempt to address how it is that a person learns.
Behaviorism states that learning is largely unknowable, that is, we can’t possibly
understand what goes on inside a person (the “black box theory”). Gredler (2001)
expresses behaviorism as being comprised of several theories that make three
Jan05_01 http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm

assumptions about learning:
Observable behaviour is more important than understanding internal activities1.
Behaviour should be focused on simple elements: specific stimuli and responses2.
Learning is about behaviour change3.
Cognitivism often takes a computer information processing model. Learning is viewed as
a process of inputs, managed in short term memory, and coded for long-term recall.
Cindy Buell details this process: “In cognitive theories, knowledge is viewed as symbolic
mental constructs in the learner's mind, and the learning process is the means by which
these symbolic representations are committed to memory.”
Constructivism suggests that learners create knowledge as they attempt to understand
their experiences (Driscoll, 2000, p. 376). Behaviorism and cognitivism view knowledge
as external to the learner and the learning process as the act of internalizing knowledge.
Constructivism assumes that learners are not empty vessels to be filled with knowledge.
Instead, learners are actively attempting to create meaning. Learners often select and
pursue their own learning. Constructivist principles acknowledge that real-life learning is
messy and complex. Classrooms which emulate the “fuzziness” of this learning will be
more effective in preparing learners for life-long learning.
Limitations of Behaviorism, Cognitivism, and Constructivism
A central tenet of most learning theories is that learning occurs inside a person. Even
social constructivist views, which hold that learning is a socially enacted process,
promotes the principality of the individual (and her/his physical presence – i.e. brain-
based) in learning. These theories do not address learning that occurs outside of people
(i.e. learning that is stored and manipulated by technology). They also fail to describe
how learning happens within organizations
Learning theories are concerned with the actual process of learning, not with the value
of what is being learned. In a networked world, the very manner of information that we
acquire is worth exploring. The need to evaluate the worthiness of learning something is
a meta-skill that is applied before learning itself begins. When knowledge is subject to
paucity, the process of assessing worthiness is assumed to be intrinsic to learning. When
knowledge is abundant, the rapid evaluation of knowledge is important. Additional
concerns arise from the rapid increase in information. In today’s environment, action is
often needed without personal learning – that is, we need to act by drawing information
outside of our primary knowledge. The ability to synthesize and recognize connections
and patterns is a valuable skill.
Many important questions are raised when established learning theories are seen
through technology. The natural attempt of theorists is to continue to revise and evolve
theories as conditions change. At some point, however, the underlying conditions have
altered so significantly, that further modification is no longer sensible. An entirely new
approach is needed.
Some questions to explore in relation to learning theories and the impact of technology
and new sciences (chaos and networks) on learning:
How are learning theories impacted when knowledge is no longer acquired in the
linear manner?

What adjustments need to made with learning theories when technology performs
many of the cognitive operations previously performed by learners (information
storage and retrieval).
How can we continue to stay current in a rapidly evolving information ecology?
How do learning theories address moments where performance is needed in the
absence of complete understanding?
What is the impact of networks and complexity theories on learning?
What is the impact of chaos as a complex pattern recognition process on learning?
With increased recognition of interconnections in differing fields of knowledge, how
are systems and ecology theories perceived in light of learning tasks?
An Alternative Theory
Including technology and connection making as learning activities begins to move
learning theories into a digital age. We can no longer personally experience and acquire
learning that we need to act. We derive our competence from forming connections.
Karen Stephenson states:
“Experience has long been considered the best teacher of knowledge. Since we cannot
experience everything, other people’s experiences, and hence other people, become the
surrogate for knowledge. ‘I store my knowledge in my friends’ is an axiom for collecting
knowledge through collecting people (undated).”
Chaos is a new reality for knowledge workers. ScienceWeek (2004) quotes Nigel
Calder's definition that chaos is “a cryptic form of order”. Chaos is the breakdown of
predictability, evidenced in complicated arrangements that initially defy order. Unlike
constructivism, which states that learners attempt to foster understanding by meaning
making tasks, chaos states that the meaning exists – the learner's challenge is to
recognize the patterns which appear to be hidden. Meaning-making and forming
connections between specialized communities are important activities.
Chaos, as a science, recognizes the connection of everything to everything. Gleick
(1987) states: “In weather, for example, this translates into what is only half-jokingly
known as the Butterfly Effect – the notion that a butterfly stirring the air today in Peking
can transform storm systems next month in New York” (p. 8). This analogy highlights a
real challenge: “sensitive dependence on initial conditions” profoundly impacts what we
learn and how we act based on our learning. Decision making is indicative of this. If the
underlying conditions used to make decisions change, the decision itself is no longer as
correct as it was at the time it was made. The ability to recognize and adjust to pattern
shifts is a key learning task.
Luis Mateus Rocha (1998) defines self-organization as the “spontaneous formation of
well organized structures, patterns, or behaviors, from random initial conditions.” (p.3).
Learning, as a self-organizing process requires that the system (personal or
organizational learning systems) “be informationally open, that is, for it to be able to
classify its own interaction with an environment, it must be able to change its
structure…” (p.4). Wiley and Edwards acknowledge the importance of self-organization
as a learning process: “Jacobs argues that communities self-organize is a manner
similar to social insects: instead of thousands of ants crossing each other’s pheromone
trails and changing their behavior accordingly, thousands of humans pass each other on
Jan05_01 http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm

the sidewalk and change their behavior accordingly.”. Self-organization on a personal
level is a micro-process of the larger self-organizing knowledge constructs created
within corporate or institutional environments. The capacity to form connections
between sources of information, and thereby create useful information patterns, is
required to learn in our knowledge economy.
Networks, Small Worlds, Weak Ties
A network can simply be defined as connections between entities. Computer networks,
power grids, and social networks all function on the simple principle that people, groups,
systems, nodes, entities can be connected to create an integrated whole. Alterations
within the network have ripple effects on the whole.
Albert-László Barabási states that “nodes always compete for connections because links
represent survival in an interconnected world” (2002, p.106). This competition is largely
dulled within a personal learning network, but the placing of value on certain nodes over
others is a reality. Nodes that successfully acquire greater profile will be more successful
at acquiring additional connections. In a learning sense, the likelihood that a concept of
learning will be linked depends on how well it is currently linked. Nodes (can be fields,
ideas, communities) that specialize and gain recognition for their expertise have greater
chances of recognition, thus resulting in cross-pollination of learning communities.
Weak ties are links or bridges that allow short connections between information. Our
small world networks are generally populated with people whose interests and
knowledge are similar to ours. Finding a new job, as an example, often occurs through
weak ties. This principle has great merit in the notion of serendipity, innovation, and
creativity. Connections between disparate ideas and fields can create new innovations.
Connectivism
Connectivism is the integration of principles explored by chaos, network, and complexity
and self-organization theories. Learning is a process that occurs within nebulous
environments of shifting core elements – not entirely under the control of the individual.
Learning (defined as actionable knowledge) can reside outside of ourselves (within an
organization or a database), is focused on connecting specialized information sets, and
the connections that enable us to learn more are more important than our current state
of knowing.
Connectivism is driven by the understanding that decisions are based on rapidly altering
foundations. New information is continually being acquired. The ability to draw
distinctions between important and unimportant information is vital. The ability to
recognize when new information alters the landscape based on decisions made
yesterday is also critical.
Principles of connectivism:
Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions.
Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources.
Learning may reside in non-human appliances.
Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known
Jan05_01 http://www.itdl.org/Journal/Jan_05/article01.htm
5 of 9 6/6/08 5:56 PM
Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning.
Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill.
Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning
activities.
Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the
meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While
there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the
information climate affecting the decision.
Connectivism also addresses the challenges that many corporations face in knowledge
management activities. Knowledge that resides in a database needs to be connected
with the right people in the right context in order to be classified as learning.
Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism do not attempt to address the challenges
of organizational knowledge and transference.
Information flow within an organization is an important element in organizational
effectiveness. In a knowledge economy, the flow of information is the equivalent of the
oil pipe in an industrial economy. Creating, preserving, and utilizing information flow
should be a key organizational activity. Knowledge flow can be likened to a river that
meanders through the ecology of an organization. In certain areas, the river pools and
in other areas it ebbs. The health of the learning ecology of the organization depends on
effective nurturing of information flow.
Social network analysis is an additional element in understanding learning models in a
digital era. Art Kleiner (2002) explores Karen Stephenson’s “quantum theory of trust”
which “explains not just how to recognize the collective cognitive capability of an
organization, but how to cultivate and increase it”. Within social networks, hubs are
well-connected people who are able to foster and maintain knowledge flow. Their
interdependence results in effective knowledge flow, enabling the personal
understanding of the state of activities organizationally.
The starting point of connectivism is the individual. Personal knowledge is comprised of
a network, which feeds into organizations and institutions, which in turn feed back into
the network, and then continue to provide learning to individual. This cycle of knowledge
development (personal to network to organization) allows learners to remain current in
their field through the connections they have formed.
Landauer and Dumais (1997) explore the phenomenon that “people have much more
knowledge than appears to be present in the information to which they have been
exposed”. They provide a connectivist focus in stating “the simple notion that some
domains of knowledge contain vast numbers of weak interrelations that, if properly
exploited, can greatly amplify learning by a process of inference”. The value of pattern
recognition and connecting our own “small worlds of knowledge” are apparent in the
exponential impact provided to our personal learning.
John Seely Brown presents an interesting notion that the internet leverages the small
efforts of many with the large efforts of few. The central premise is that connections
created with unusual nodes supports and intensifies existing large effort activities.
Brown provides the example of a Maricopa County Community College system project
that links senior citizens with elementary school students in a mentor program. The
children “listen to these “grandparents” better than they do their own parents, the
mentoring really helps the teachers…the small efforts of the many- the seniors –
complement the large efforts of the few – the teachers.” (2002). This amplification of

learning, knowledge and understanding through the extension of a personal network is
the epitome of connectivism.
 
Implications
The notion of connectivism has implications in all aspects of life. This paper largely
focuses on its impact on learning, but the following aspects are also impacted:
Management and leadership. The management and marshalling of resources to
achieve desired outcomes is a significant challenge. Realizing that complete
knowledge cannot exist in the mind of one person requires a different approach to
creating an overview of the situation. Diverse teams of varying viewpoints are a
critical structure for completely exploring ideas. Innovation is also an additional
challenge. Most of the revolutionary ideas of today at one time existed as a fringe
element. An organizations ability to foster, nurture, and synthesize the impacts of
varying views of information is critical to knowledge economy survival. Speed of
“idea to implementation” is also improved in a systems view of learning.
Media, news, information. This trend is well under way. Mainstream media
organizations are being challenged by the open, real-time, two-way information flow
of blogging.
Personal knowledge management in relation to organizational knowledge
management
Design of learning environments
 
Conclusion:
The pipe is more important than the content within the pipe. Our ability to learn what
we need for tomorrow is more important than what we know today. A real challenge for
any learning theory is to actuate known knowledge at the point of application. When
knowledge, however, is needed, but not known, the ability to plug into sources to meet
the requirements becomes a vital skill. As knowledge continues to grow and evolve,
access to what is needed is more important than what the learner currently possesses.
Connectivism presents a model of learning that acknowledges the tectonic shifts in
society where learning is no longer an internal, individualistic activity. How people work
and function is altered when new tools are utilized. The field of education has been slow
to recognize both the impact of new learning tools and the environmental changes in
what it means to learn. Connectivism provides insight into learning skills and tasks
needed for learners to flourish in a digital era.
