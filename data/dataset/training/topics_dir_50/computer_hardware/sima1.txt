1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
The growth in use of multimedia within the UK Higher Education sector has accelerated in recent years,
and looks set for continued expansion in the future. However, this expansion has not followed any
coherent structure and consequently a wide variety of hardware and software is currently used for
multimedia applications, with little or no co-ordination between institutions in terms of cross-platform
compatibility.
The Support Initiative for Multimedia Applications (SIMA) is funded under the New Technologies
Initiative (NTI) from the Joint Systems Committee of the HEFCs. It aims to provide a single focus of
information in the area of multimedia and will link in with other projects and initiatives for UK Higher
Education and will dovetails with the current activities of the Advisory Group on Computer Graphics
(AGOCG).
This survey was commissioned by SIMA to establish the range of hardware and software currently in use
for multimedia applications in UK Higher Education.
1.2 Scope
The restricted timescale available for this survey prevented full coverage of all multimedia activities
within UK Higher Education. Consequently it was decided to limit the coverage of the survey to those
projects funded by various HEFC initiatives, specifically the Teaching and Learning Technology
Programme (TLTP), the Information Technology Training Initiative (ITTI), multimedia projects funded
by the NTI, and other projects commissioned by SIMA.
The survey concentrated on the hardware and software in current use by projects for development and
delivery of multimedia applications,. The survey also aimed to determine the importance to projects of
standards, both de jure and industry/de facto.
Responses from projects which did not involve multimedia are identified separately within this report.
The full list of projects covered by the survey, including those which did not respond, can be found in
Section 3.

1.3 Distribution and returns
The questionnaire was distributed by electronic mail to all projects offering an e-mail address. A copy of
the questionnaire was faxed to the three projects which did not have e-mail access. The survey
questionnaire and covering letter can be found in Section 2.
The following shows the breakdown of the number of projects covered by the survey by funding body,
and the number of responses in each case.
Funding Body Sent out Returned Return Rate
ITTI 22 9 40.9%
NTI 11 9 81.8%
SIMA 10 4 40.0%
TLTP 76 28 36.8%
Total 119 50 42.0%
All responses were edited into a standard format before being analysed. Reference numbers of  TLTP
and NTI funded projects were supplied by the relevant bodies, whereas those for ITTI and SIMA only
relate to this report for reference purposes.
The primary grouping of results within the report is by project funding body, with a secondary overall
grouping where considered necessary.
In general, all comments have been repeated verbatim, although in a small number of cases editing was
required because of the length of the original response.

2. SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE
SIMA Multimedia Survey
Dear <name>,
I am contacting you in  your role as the designated contact for <project name>, as part of a survey of
multimedia in UK Higher Education.
This survey is being carried out on behalf of the Support Initiative for Multimedia Applications (SIMA)
to establish the range of software and hardware currently in use for multimedia within UK Higher
Education.
The survey results will be used to establish a central reference directory of multimedia projects which
will be maintained by the SIMA Multimedia Support Officer, Sue Cunningham. The directory will also
be available via the Advisory Group on Computer Graphics (AGOCG) World Wide Web page.
I would appreciate it if you could complete and return the survey by the 31st July 1994 at the latest.
Yours sincerely,

e-mail : apatel@dmu.ac.uk
URL:
Main use of multimedia : Developing software and research into the potential of multimedia 
applications
Brief description : The project is unique in providing a Human Tutor Emulation in teaching of
multi-variate, applied and numerical skills. Though the applications being 
developed pertain to Accounting, the approach has significance for all areas 
of engineering. The software has the knowledge of all inter-relationships 
involved in a specific domain and is capable of intelligent and graded 
feedback including direction to an intermediate stage where necessary, just as
a human tutor would guide a student.

information is critical to the learning process. This proposal is the natural 
extension of TE01 (Teaching Project No.1) in the SuperJANET Demonstrator
Programme. The programme will involve students undergoing surgical 
training in a collaborative programme using interactive video teaching and 
learning techniques over the new high speed data network SuperJANET.

Title : The Development of CAL Course Material for the Teaching of Corrosion in 
Engineering
Project Leaders : Dr R.A. Cottis
Organisation : UMIST
Department : Corrosion and Protection Centre
e-mail : R.A.Cottis@umist.ac.uk
URL:
Main use of multimedia : developing teaching materials
Brief description : The project is concerned with the provision of material to support the
teaching of corrosion control to engineering undergraduates.  It is based on 
the use of case studies, with students being given access to a 'hidden' set of 
modules on corrosion theory when they need it. It is hoped that this will show
the relevance of the theory to practice very clearly, and help to maintain 
motivation.

8. COMMENTS: HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE
The reference code given after each comment refers to the project reference number in the main project
listing in Section 3.
8.1 ITTI projects
Generally well integrated and works well. (06)
All have their limitations. The de-standardisation of the IBM PC is a nightmare as far as  multimedia is
concerned. Read our Guidelines! (09)
It's getting there (13)
Excellent and definitely better than a PC/Windows. (17)
Getting good screen dumps for inclusion in material is extraordinarily time-consuming. (22)
8.2 NTI projects
Needs a lot more development before being fielded in the non-IT community. (35)
The implementation of this type of application is reasonably straightforward. Authoring tools all have
limitations and require computer professionals to be involved for maximum efficiency.  (63)
Mosaic is likely to be a useful multimedia navigating tool for this application. (97)
Intel Smart Video Recorder has problems with PAL capture. (232)
We find that the Mac is fine to work with, if a little reticent in allowing you to find out what it is doing
(our previous experience is with UNIX, which is not as nice for the user but nicer for the programmer
since its diagnostics are much more accessible). Most of our problems arise from the linguistics
software: sources not available, incompatibilities between versions of the programming languages that
support them, and *particularly* lack of documentation. We have also found Hypercard lacking in
functionality, although it has nice features for constructing  interfaces quickly. (242)
8.3 SIMA projects
Sun IPX workstations are underpowered for video decompression. ShowMe software initially looks
good, but it is early days. (01)
The Mac is an ideal platform for video conferencing. Both hardware and software are easily obtainable.
However, saying this, I have had software compatibility problems on one Mac platform - a Mac LC. (03)
You'll have to read the report! (05)
We are still setting up the video links, and have had problems with the audio (there are echo problems).
WWW has its drawbacks and interactive programming is not straightforward. (08)
46
8.4 TLTP projects
The project has to use what is available now, and adjust our needs to use what is there. Some of it is
fine, but others annoy and we want the next version.(01)
When developing applications on a high spec. machine, one has to continually be aware of the recipients
of the application. They are unlikely to have a high end machine, this must be taken into account during
development, for example accessing large graphic files must be minimised, and the inclusion of sound
and video must take into consideration the resources of the target audience. The major issue regarding
software is to find out about runtime versions for your development software and any royalties that will
have to be paid. This is an important issue for distribution of your application.(03)
We have generally been satisfied with the choice of software and hardware we have made. Increasing
sophistication of authors and availability of things like digital video mean we are pushing the
specification of the machines to the limit. The software has proved relatively easy for the academic
authors to learn but we suspect the ones we have met have been keen and fairly computer literate already.
It is questionable how far the authoring skills will penetrate the academic community. (05)
The project uses PCs and Macs at our lead site and have had no problems or particular experiences.(11)
It appears reasonably well suited for the purposes of producing material as described above. (13)
Toolbook is an excellent authoring package for MS windows. It is very easy to learn and gives you
access to windows' functionality. We have already decided to upgrade to the multimedia version 3.0.
Mathematica is one of the best, if not the best, symbolic algebra system on the market. It also has a
powerful programming language which allows quite complex algorithms to be coded in just a few lines.
(15)
Windows is flaky. (22)
All have their limitations; the de-standardisation of the IBM PC is a nightmare as far as multimedia is
concerned. (23)
We use whatever is available. We do not seek to purchase special multimedia equipment. (24)
The hardware is not a problem. Authoring software is a problem. Some specialised ones like
Authorware are too restrictive in what the end product can do and is very expensive. Some like
HyperCard and Toolbook are flexible but slow and single platform. We moved to Director because of
its power and its cross-platform promise, but it is difficult to learn. (30)
Software: no one product does everything we want, but producing our own would be prohibitive in cost
and not in line with our aim of making products easily locally adaptable. Hence we have had to trim the
conceptions to fit the software capabilities. Hardware: Lack of standards and card incompatibilities is a
problem with PC-based systems, particularly as far as delivery is concerned. (34)
Too early to comment. (36)
Our main experience of the hardware used in the project is that delivery on student network systems is
difficult. Software experience is mainly that you need to be an expert in every program you use (or have
an expert available) in order to write good material. (39)
The software development systems for each platform are quite good although we are on the look out
for a multiplatform development kit that supports C++ FULLY. (43)
47
We are quite happy with the PC compatible hardware as this is the commercial platform our students are
most likely to use in their jobs. We haven't had any significant problems in using our chosen hardware
and software platforms, especially as we do not have any intermediary  authoring software which might
make our work easy but also enforce some limitations. We can't get excited about the multimedia
platform because there is hardly any installed base of multimedia computers in the Business School
computer Labs, across the country. The process  of upgrading the 8086 and 80286 PCs to 80386 and
Windows platform has just begun in many institutions. In our opinion, it will be quite some time before
multimedia computers are introduced in these labs and therefore we will not make multimedia an integral
feature of the software. On the other hand, basic spec. PCs are becoming affordable by students and about
20% of our students already have an access to a basic spec. PC outside the institution's labs and library.
(48)
Video is poor but rest of hardware and software adequate for the job. (57)
The software appears to do what we need very effectively, and we have not yet experienced major
problems or limitations. The hardware is adequate, although the video and graphics capability is more
limited than would be ideal, and the system is rather slow when switching to a new module. (71)
No problems with hardware, except for the continual pressure it places on the size of hard  disks. All our
development machines have 16meg of RAM, and this has been fine. We toyed with developing using 17
inch monitors, but felt that we had to work at the screen standard  our users would have. We have
compromised on 15 inch flat screens. Our subject area has a high need for text and video materials, and a
lowish need for graphics. None of the authoring  systems are ideal, but so far Guide has been most useful.
We are soon to try out the new  version of Toolbook (72)
Debugging Windows programs is considerably trickier than non-Windows software.
ToolBook makes it very easy to produce good-looking software quickly, but the files tend to be large and
run very slowly. A mixture of ToolBook with carefully-crafted DLLs seems to be the best way. (73)
Acceptable. (75)
OK. (76)

9  STANDARDS
The reference code given after each comment refers to the project reference number in the  main project
listing in Section 3.
9.1 ITTI projects
Standards used:
image: BMP, FIF, GIF, PICT, TIFF
sound: 8-bit Mu-Law, WAV
video : AVI, MPEG, Quicktime
compression: Indeo, MPEG, Quicktime, TIFF(LZW), Video 1
other: HTML
Comments on the importance of standards:
Very. ISO, CCITT, Internet RFC and 'industry' standards are all used as appropriate. (06)
Very important. We have produced a standards guidelines for multimedia developers in HE called "New
Frontiers of Learning: Vol. 1 - Delivery, Production & Provision". (09)
VERY. (17)
9.2 NTI projects
Standards used:
image: BMP, CGM, DXF, GIF, PhotoCD, TGA
sound:
video: H.261, Indeo, MPEG
compression: fractal, JPEG
other: HTML
Comments on the importance of standards:
Very. (35)
Very. (40)
Not too important as image formats are easily converted from one format to another. (40)
Not very.  (42)
Not really - the system sims to make use of external data in whatever format is supplied. (42a)
Essential for project longevity. (48)
Not very important at this stage. (63)
Standards are important to the project. (97)
Very important. (146)
VERY. Use standard front-end design. Hardware standards marginally important - so long as
exchangeable data possible. (232)
We do need a means for a variety of applications to communicate with one another, but are  currently
looking into ways of doing this. (242)
49
9.3 SIMA projects
Standards used:
image: GIF, TGA
sound:
video: H.261, MPEG
compression:
Comments on the importance of standards:
Not that important, although the use of video compression standards (e.g. H.261) wilt be discussed in the
project report. (03)
We are tending to use WWW so there are inherent standards there, though we can use conversion
utilities. The video standards are dictated by what systems are available for our use. (08)
9.4 TLTP projects
Standards used:
image: BMP, FIF, GIF, PICT, PIX, TIFF
sound: MIDI, SoundBlaster Pro, WAV
video: AVI, H261, H.320, MPEG, Quicktime
compression: fractal, Indeo, JPEG, MPEG, Quicktime, Video 1
Comments on the importance of standards:
They seem rather mythical - so many are determined by forces beyond our control. The project evolves
strategies to cope with ever-changing standards. (01)
We try and use industry standards as far as possible to ensure portability of any applications developed.
(03)
Have not set a standard for compression. Have looked at fractal compression but are unhappy with their
licence demands. We are trying to develop a standard look to the packages to make it easier for the
students to change between packages without a new learning curve. This is more a house style rather than
a standard. The authoring packages dictate which standard formats can be imported and manipulated.
(05)
Not important at present. (15)
Essential. (19)
Very. (22)
Very important. Our group has been developing a courseware delivery shell and has been responsible for
producing standards guidelines under the auspices of the ITTI Initiative. (23)
We do not seek to impose standards. The ONLY thing that is important is that courseware gets written
AND USED. The idea that British academics can set or impose standards is a fiction. Standards are set
by folks like Mr Gates. As long as the material can be re-authored easily, that is all that matters. (24)
Somewhat. (30)
Wherever possible industry standards are being adhered to. (32)
Very - we have devolved development sites throughout the UK so there must be compatibility. (34)
We are hoping ultimately to have all software written for SoundBlaster Pro. (36)
Not very at this stage. (39)
Support for standards is critical as we expect many of the resources for our courseware to be produced
by 3rd party packages. (43)
50
Not relevant as we are not currently producing multimedia applications - their importance can't be
currently assessed. (48)
Standards of all types vital as project is located at several sites. (57)
Quite. (58)
Standards are vital to obtain compatibility. (60)
Not very. (71)
Not desperately; the end product (the simulation) is the important part. Simulations are developed  at one
site only, and tested at the others. (73)
Very little. (75)
Internally within the project we have agreed standards. (76)
9.5 List of standards
image: BMP, CGM, DXF, FIF, GIF, PICT, PIX PhotoCD, TGA, TIFF
