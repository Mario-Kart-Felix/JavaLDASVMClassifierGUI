2015 Taulbee Survey
Continued Booming Undergraduate CS Enrollment;  
Doctoral Degree Production Dips Slightly
This article and the accompanying figures and tables present 
the results from the 45th annual CRA Taulbee Survey1. The 
survey, conducted annually by the Computing Research 
Association, documents trends in student enrollment, 
degree production, employment of graduates, and faculty 
salaries in academic units in the United States and Canada 
that grant the Ph.D. in computer science (CS), computer 
engineering (CE) or information (I)2. Most of these academic 
units are departments, but some are colleges or schools of 
information or computing.  In this report, we will use the term 
“department” to refer to the unit offering the program.  This 
year’s survey also includes the so-called “department profiles” 
data about space, research funding sources, and teaching 
loads; these data are only requested every three years.
CRA gathers survey data during the fall. Responses received 
by February 5, 2016 are included in the analysis.  The period 
covered by the data varies from table to table. Degree 
production and enrollment (Ph.D., Master’s, and Bachelor’s) 
refer to the previous academic year (2014-15). Data for new 
students in all categories refer to the current academic year 
(2015-16). Projected student production and information on 
faculty salaries are also for the current academic year; salaries 
are those effective January 1, 2016. 
We surveyed a total of 266 Ph.D.-granting departments; 
we received responses from 178 for a response rate of 
67 percent. This is similar to last year’s 68 percent.  The 
response rates from CE and Canadian departments continue 
to be rather low, and this year the CE response rate was 
even lower than usual.  U.S. CS, U.S. I, and Canadian response 
rates were similar to last year.  Figure 1 shows the history 
of response rates to the survey.  Response rates are inexact 
because some departments provide only partial data, 
and some institutions provide a single joint response for 
multiple departments. Thus, in some tables the number of 
departments shown as reporting will not equal the overall 
total number of respondents shown in Figure 1 for that 
category of department.  
To account for the changes in response rate, we will comment 
not only on aggregate totals but also on averages per 
department reporting or data from those departments that 
responded to both this year’s and last year’s surveys.  This is 
a more accurate indication of the one-year changes affecting 
the data.  
Departments that responded to the survey were sent 
preliminary results about faculty salaries in December 2015; 
these results included additional distributional information not 
contained in this report.  The CRA Board views this as a benefit 
of participating in the survey.  
Degree, enrollment and faculty salary data for the U.S CS 
departments are stratified according to a) whether the 
institution is public or private, and b) the tenure-track faculty 
size of the reporting department.  The faculty size strata 
deliberately overlap, so that data from most departments 
affect multiple strata.  This may be especially useful to 
departments near the boundary of one stratum.  Salary data 
also is stratified according to the population of the locale in 
which the institution is located.3  These stratifications allow 
our readers to see multiple views of important data, and 
hopefully gain new insights from them.  In addition to tabular 
presentations of data, we will use “box and whisker” diagrams 
to show medians, quartiles, and the range between the 10th 
and 90th percentile data points.  
We thank all respondents to this year’s questionnaire. 
Departments that participated are listed at the end of this 
article.  CRA member respondents again will be given the 
opportunity to obtain certain survey information for a self-
selected peer group.  Instructions for doing this will be emailed 
to all such departments.

Doctoral Degree Production, Enrollments and 
Employment
(Tables D1-D10; Figures D1-D6)
Last year’s respondents reported production of 1,940 
doctoral degrees.  This year’s respondents produced 1,780 
doctoral degrees, a decline of 8.2 percent.  However, on a 
per-department basis, the decline is only 4.9 percent.  An 
examination of the data by area of computing shows that 
the aggregate decline in degrees produced does not come 
from U.S. CS departments, and that overall, U.S. private 
CS departments actually increased their productivity on 
a per-department basis.  Each of the other groups (CE, I 
and Canadian) show declines, but these numbers are more 
strongly influenced by the specific departments responding in 
a given year, since we receive data from only a small number 
of these departments.
Among all departments reporting both this year and last year, 
the number of total doctoral degrees declined by 3.5 percent, 
but among U.S. CS departments reporting both years, there 
was essentially no change (actually an increase of 0.3 percent). 
Women comprised 18.3 percent of CS doctoral graduates and 
20.2 percent of all doctoral computing graduates, both values 
being slightly higher than those reported last year.  The 
percentage of CS doctoral degrees that went to Non-resident 
Aliens also was slightly higher than last year, at 60.7 percent 
compared with 60.1 percent, while the percentage that went 
to resident Asians dropped to 6.4 percent from 8.1 percent.  CE 
had an even higher percentage of Non-resident Aliens than did 
CS, and was less gender diverse.  Among I doctoral degrees, 
45.8 percent went to Non-resident Aliens and 33.8 percent to 
Whites; for Non-resident Aliens this is an increase compared 
with last year’s report; for Whites it is a slight decrease.  
The percentage of doctoral graduates who were American 
Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Native 
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic, or Multiracial Non-Hispanic 
rose from 2.6 percent to 4.0 percent in CS, and was 4.5 percent 
in aggregate across CS, CE and I (vs 3.4 percent in 2013-14).  As

they did last year, Non-resident Aliens and Resident Asians 
comprised a higher percentage of the CS female doctoral 
graduates than they did CS male graduates, while Whites 
comprised a lower percentage of the female graduates as 
compared with male graduates (Table D9).    
Among currently enrolled CS doctoral students whose ethnicity 
is known, we see the same direction of difference among 
Non-resident Aliens and Whites; Non-resident Aliens comprise a 
higher percent of the enrolled women than they do the enrolled 
men, and Whites comprise a lower percentage of enrolled 
women.  This is similar to the observations last year.  Resident 
Asians comprise a similar percentage of enrolled Asian men 
and Asian women (Table D10).

Among those pursuing I degrees, 62 percent of the men and 
55 percent of the women are Non-resident Aliens or Resident 
Asians.  This is a higher percentage for both men and women 
than last year, but is a similar-sized difference between men 
and women. Also similar to last year, there is no appreciable 
difference in the percentage of men vs the percentage of 
women among Whites pursuing I degrees. 
At U.S. CS departments, the average number of students per 
department who passed qualifier exams rose to 14.3 in 2014-15, 
from 13.9 in 2013-14.  The increase was due to departments 
in public institutions; there was a decrease in U.S. private 
institutions.  The average number per department who 
passed thesis candidacy exams in 2014-15 (most, but not all, 
departments have such exams) increased slightly from 2013-14 
at both public and private U.S. CS departments (Table D1).      
Once again, the number of new Ph.D. students per department 
reporting increased slightly this year compared with the total 
from last year’s reporting departments (Tables 1 and D5). This 
reflects increases in CS departments and decreases in CE, 
I, and Canadian departments.  Among all departments that

reported both years, the number of new Ph.D. students was 
unchanged.  If only U.S. CS departments that reported both 
years are considered, there was an increase of 2.0 percent. 
The proportion of new doctoral students from outside North 
America continues to increase.  This year’s proportion is 
65.7 percent while last year’s was 62.6 percent.  There were 
increases in all categories of departments with the exception 
of U.S. CS private (Table D5a).  
Among programs that reported both years, total doctoral 
enrollment increased 1.1 percent.  If only U.S. computer science 
departments are considered, the increase was only 0.2 
percent (Table 1).  Total doctoral enrollment by gender is in 
about the same overall proportion reported last year (Table 
D7), with a slight increase in diversity in CS and a decrease 
in I departments. The fraction 
of doctoral students who are 
not either Non-resident Aliens, 
Asian or White remains below 5 
percent (Table D8).  
Figure D5 shows a graphical 
view of the Ph.D. pipeline for 
computer science programs.  
The data in this graph are 
normalized by the number of 
departments reporting.  The 
graph offsets the qualifier data 
by two years from the data 
for new students, and offsets 
the graduation data by five 
years from the data for new 
students.  These data have 
been useful in estimating the 
timing of changes in production 
rates.  The graph suggests 
that doctoral production will 
remain fairly steady during the 
next few years, though the 
departments are forecasting an 
increase in production during 
2015-16 (Table D1).
Figure D6 shows the 
employment trend of 
new Ph.D.s in academia 
and industry, those taking employment outside of North 
America, and those going to academia who took positions in 
departments other than Ph.D.-granting CS/CE departments.  
Table D4 shows a more detailed breakdown of the 
employment data for new Ph.D.s.  The percentage of new 
Ph.D.s who took positions in North American industry was 
57.3 percent, just below last year’s historic record of 57.5 
percent.  Among those doctoral graduates who went to North 
American industry as other than a postdoc and for whom the 
type of industry position was known, about 59 percent took 
research positions (Table D4a).  This is up from the 56 percent 
reported last year.  This year, definitive data was provided 
for 90 percent of the graduates who went to industry, an 
improvement over last year’s 87 percent.

The percentage of 2014-15 graduates who took North American 
academic jobs rose this year to 29.0 from last year’s all-time 
low of 27.3. The percentage of graduates taking tenure-track 
positions in North American doctoral granting computing 
departments rose to 10.0 in 2014-15, from 7.6 for 2013-14 
graduates.  The percentage taking positions in North American 
non-Ph.D.-granting computing departments rose from 1.9 
percent to 2.3 percent, while the percentage taking North 
American academic postdoctoral positions dropped from 11.6 
percent to 9.7 percent.
Among those whose employment is known, the proportion of 
Ph.D. graduates who were reported taking positions outside 
of North America fell from 9.4 percent  to 7.8 percent.  Only 24 
percent of those employed outside of North America went to 
industry compared to 37 percent reported last year.  About 
17 percent went to tenure-track academic positions, down 
from 26 percent last year, while approximately 20 percent 
went to academic postdoctoral positions, similar to last year.  
Teaching and research positions in academic departments, and 
employment in government positions, were higher this year 
among those who went outside North America.  Of the doctoral 
graduates who went to non-North American industry positions, 
the positions were in research by almost a two-to-one margin 
over those that were not research; that ratio was three-to-one 
each of the past two years.  Definitive data was provided for 
96 percent of these graduates.
Employment in industry postdoctoral positions is included in 
the overall industry numbers.  When academic and industry 
postdocs are combined, the result is that 12.6 percent of 2014-
15 doctoral graduates took some type of postdoctoral position, 
down from 15.6 percent last year and 18.1 percent the year 
before last. Approximately 11 percent of these were industry 
postdocs; last year 14 percent of postdocs were industry 
postdocs.
The unemployment rate for new Ph.D.s again this year was 
below one percent.  In 2014-15, 21.0 percent of new Ph.D.s’ 
employment status was unknown; in 2013-14 it was 19.7 
percent.  It is possible that the lack of information about the 
employment of more than one in five graduates skews the real 
overall percentages for certain employment categories.

Table D4 also indicates the areas of specialty of new Ph.D.s. 
Artificial intelligence, networks, software engineering 
and databases continue to be the most popular areas of 
specialization for doctoral graduates.  But this year the order 
is different.  Software engineering moved from third to first, 
followed by artificial intelligence, databases and networks.

Master’s and Bachelor’s Degree Production  
and Enrollments 
This section reports data about enrollment and degree 
production for Master’s and Bachelor’s programs in the 
doctoral-granting departments. Although the absolute number 
of degrees and enrolled students reported herein only reflect 
departments that offer the doctoral degree, the trends 
observed in the master’s and bachelor’s data from these 
departments tend to strongly reflect trends in the larger 
population of programs that offer such degrees.
Master’s (Tables M1-M8; Figures M1-M2)
On a per-department basis, CS master’s degree production in 
U.S. CS departments rose nearly 25% in 2014-15; this follows

two consecutive years of relatively flat production.  Both public 
and private departments reported large increases.  
Overall production of master’s degrees in the information 
area declined in 2014-15, following two consecutive years of 
growth.  U.S. public CS departments showed an increased 
production of information Master’s degrees, while U.S. private 
CS departments reported decreases.  U.S. I departments 
also reported decreased production of information master’s 
degrees, the opposite of what took place last year (Table M1).
The proportion of female graduates among master’s degree 
recipients rose in CS from 22.0 percent to 24.9 percent, and 
this resulted in a slight rise in the overall percentage of 
master’s degrees to women, from 28.7 to 29.3 (Table M2). 
In the information area, the percentage of the master’s 
recipients that were Non-resident Aliens increased in 2014-15 
to 33.3 percent as compared with 28.1 percent 2013-14.  In CS, 
68.1 percent of the master’s degrees went to Non-resident 
Aliens, similar to the 67.8 percent in 2013-14.  In both CS and 
I, the fraction of master’s degrees going to Whites declined 
(Table M3). 
Again this year, Non-resident Aliens comprised a much larger 
proportion of female CS degree recipients than male CS degree 
recipients, while Whites comprised a larger percentage of 
male CS degree recipients than female CS degree recipients 
(Table M7).  With somewhat differing percentages, the same 
observations held for CE master’s graduates. In the I area, 
Non-resident Aliens again comprised a larger percentage of 
male master’s graduates than female master’s graduates, 
and Whites comprised a smaller fraction of male master’s 
graduates than female master’s graduates.  The current 
enrollment breakdown by gender and ethnicity (Table M8) 
suggests that these observations will continue to be reflected 
in master’s recipients in the near future.

There were increases in the average number of new master’s 
students enrolled in U.S. CS departments.  U.S. CS departments 
at both public and private institutions experienced these 
increases (Table M5).  For departments at public institutions, 
this represents the fourth straight year of increases.  This 
suggests further increased production of master’s degrees in 
the next couple of years.   
The fraction of new master’s students in U.S. CS departments 
that is reported to be from outside North America declined 
slightly, from 64.5 percent in 2014-15 to 63.3 percent in 2015-16 
(Table M5). At U.S. information departments, the fraction of 
new master’s students from outside North America decreased 
from 43.5 percent to 32.4 percent, following two consecutive 
years of increase.

When comparing all departments reporting this year to all 
departments reporting last year, there was an increase in 
bachelor’s degree production of 26.9 percent overall, and 
21.6 percent per department.  When considering only those 
departments that reported both years, the increase was 
22.2 percent.  Among U.S. computer science departments, 
the increases were 21.8 percent overall and 14.7 percent 
per department when comparing totals for all reporting 
departments.  The increase was 17.7 percent for those U.S. CS 
departments that reported both years (Table 1).

This marks the second consecutive year of double-digit 
percentage increases in bachelor’s degree production.  It is 
a natural outgrowth of the booming bachelor’s enrollments 
reported for the past several years.  
For the eighth straight year, there was an increase in 
the number of new undergraduate computing majors.  
This year’s respondents reported 17.8 percent more new 
majors (16.2 percent per department) than did last year’s 
respondents.  The increase is 14.3 percent when considering 
only those departments reporting both this year and 
last year. Among U.S. computer science departments, 
the increase was 24.1 percent overall (16.0 percent per 
department), and 17.1 percent among departments reporting 
both this year and last year.  Figure B2 illustrates the trend 
in the total number of newly declared CS/CE undergraduate 
majors as reported in the Taulbee Survey.  Over the past four 
years, this number has almost doubled, and now exceeds 
the levels reported during the dot-com boom period.
Total undergraduate enrollment in computing majors among 
U.S. CS departments (i.e., the sum of the number of majors 
in CS, CE and I at these departments) increased 22.5 percent 
(13.6 percent per department) when all respondents are 
compared, and increased 12.6 percent among departments 
reporting both this year and last year.  Aggregate

departments, I departments and Canadian departments) once

again increased in all three computing areas (CS, CE, and 
I), although the increase in CE was only just over 2 percent 
(Table B6).  New student enrollment also increased once again 
in all three areas (Table B5).  
The proportion of women among bachelor’s graduates in CS 
rose from 14.1 percent in 2013-14 to 15.7 percent in 2014-15.  In 
CE, the percentage of female bachelor’s graduates was 11.6, 
the same as it was two years ago (it was 11.2 percent last 
year).  There also was an increase in the percentage of I 
degrees going to women from 20.3 percent to 21.7 percent

Whites declined from 57.7 percent in 2013-14 to 55.0 percent in 
2014-15, and the percentage awarded to Asians rose from 21.1 
percent to 22.8 percent.  Changes in other ethnicity categories 
were less than one percent in CS.  In aggregate across the 
three degree areas, 54.2 percent of the graduates were White, 
21.8 percent Asian, 8.5 percent Non-resident Aliens, and 15.5 
percent all other ethnicity categories combined.  However, in I 
programs, the other ethnicity categories accounted for over 23 
percent of the graduates (Table B3).
In all three computing areas (CS, CE and I), Resident Asians and 
Non-resident Aliens comprise a larger fraction of female degree 
recipients than male recipients, while Whites comprise a larger 
fraction of male degree recipients than female recipients 
(Table B7).  Table B8 indicates that the same comparisons hold 
true for total bachelor’s enrollment.  We observed these same 
results in last year’s report.

Faculty Demographics (Tables F1-F9)4
Table F1 shows the current and anticipated sizes, in FTE, for 
tenure-track, teaching and research faculty, and postdocs.   
The total tenure-track faculty count in U.S. CS departments 
(3,880) represents about a 9 percent increase over last 
year.  The average tenure-track faculty size per U.S. CS 
department went from 27.4 to 28.1 during this period.  In 
these departments, the average number of teaching faculty 
increased from 5.7 to 6.9 and the average number of postdocs 
increased from 6.0 to 6.5, while the average number of 
research faculty decreased from 6.1 to 5.4.  Canadian, CE and 
I departments have much more volatile data due to the small 
number of departments reporting in each of those categories.
As we have mentioned in previous Taulbee reports, Canadian 
universities, on average, have several more tenure-track 
faculty members per department than do U.S. universities, 
while on average U.S. I departments and U.S. CE departments 
are somewhat smaller than U.S. CS departments.  The 
observations about U.S. CE and I departments may reflect the 
fact that we ask departments to report only computing-related 
faculty, so departments with Library Science or EE programs 
may report only part of their faculty. 
Among U.S. CS departments, those at private universities 
tend to have more teaching faculty, research faculty and 
postdocs than do those at public universities on average. This 
observation also was made last year.  However, this year the 
average tenure-track faculty size at public universities was 
slightly larger than that at private universities; this is a change 
from previous years.
Table F2 summarizes faculty hiring this past year. The success 
rate for hiring tenure-track faculty at U.S. CS departments fell 
from 80.2 percent in 2013-14 to 70.8 percent in 2014-15.  Even 
with this decline the 2014-15 rate still was higher than that 
of two years ago.  The success rate was almost identical at 
public and private departments.  Again this year, Canadian 
departments had lower success rates on average than did U.S.

CS, U.S. CE and U.S. I departments. In aggregate, the tenure-
track hiring success rate fell from 78.8 percent to 70.6 percent.
Among those hired into all categories of academic positions 
(tenure-track, teaching faculty, research faculty and postdoc) 
in 2014-15, 21.6 percent were women, a slight decrease from 
the 22.1 percent in 2013-14 (Table F3).  Considering only tenure-
track positions, the proportion of women hired declined 
from 21.8 percent in 2013-14 to 20.3 percent in 2014-15.  Only 
among research faculty positions was there an increase in 
the percentage of positions going to women as compared 
with those reported last year.  The percentage of new 
female tenure-track and overall faculty hires is similar to the 
percentage of new female Ph.D.s produced this past year.  
Among new tenure-track faculty, the fraction who are white 
declined from 49.5 percent to 44.8 percent, while the fraction 
who are Non-resident Alien or Asian new hires rose from 41.8 
percent to 43.5 percent.  Once again, whites dominated the 
newly hired teaching faculty, with Asians and Non-resident 
Aliens accounting for most of the remainder.  Among research 
faculty, whites comprised 42.3 percent of new hires, while 
Non-resident Aliens or resident Asians in aggregate comprised 
53.8 percent of new hires. Among postdoc new hires, whites 
comprised 19.8 percent, about half of what it was last year, 
with Non-resident Aliens and resident Asians collectively 
comprising 75.4 percent compared with just over 50 percent 
last year (Table F4).    
There were slightly fewer faculty losses reported this year 
as compared with last year (Table F5). Retirements were the 
biggest reason for faculty loss, and were up substantially 
this year as compared with last year.  Movement from one 
academic position to another was the next largest cause of 
faculty attrition.  
The proportion of women at the full professor rank rose from 
13.3 percent last year to 14.3 percent this year, while the 
proportion at the associate professor level rose from 20.5 to 
22.1 percent.   The proportion at the assistant professor level, 
however, fell from 24.6 to 23.7 percent (Table F6).  There also 
were decreases in the proportion of women among teaching 
faculty and postdocs, while there was an increase in the 
proportion of women among research faculty.  Whites, Asians 
and Non-resident Aliens account for more than 85 percent of 
each category of faculty members (Table F7).

Ninety-five percent of departments provided gender by 
ethnicity breakdowns for their current faculty members. 
(Tables F8 and F9).  Whites again comprised a greater 
percentage of female full professors than they do male full 
professors, while the reverse is true at the associate professor 
level.  Asians comprise a greater percentage of male full 
professors than they do female full professors.
For next year, U.S. CS departments forecast a 7.6 percent 
growth in tenure-track faculty, and an 11.7 percent growth in 
teaching faculty.  They also forecast a 12.0 percent growth in 
postdocs.

Research Expenditures (Table R1; Figures R1-R2)
Table R1 shows the department’s total expenditure (including 
indirect costs or “overhead” as stated on project budgets) 
from external sources of support.  Figures R1 and R2 show 
the per capita expenditure, where capitation is computed two 
ways.  The first (Figure R1) is relative to the number of tenure-
track faculty members.  The second (Figure R2) is relative to 
researchers and postdocs as well as tenure-track faculty.  
Canadian levels are shown in Canadian dollars.  
Overall median research expenditures for 2014-15 at U.S. 
CS public departments fell 10.7 percent in comparison with 
2013-14.  At U.S. CS departments in private institutions, 
median expenditures rose 37.6 percent.  The median research 
expenditure at U.S. CS departments in private institutions is 
nearly twice that of public institutions.  Median expenditures 
also fell at U.S. I departments and Canadian departments in 
comparison with 2013-14.  It should be noted that for each 
department type, fewer departments provided research

expenditure data this year than did so last year.  This was 
especially true for U.S. CS departments.  Furthermore, the I and 
Canadian departments are based on much smaller samples, 
which makes these comparisons subject to more volatility.  
There was an insufficient number of CE departments reporting 
to be able to report any meaningful comparative results.
The U.S. CS data for public institutions indicate that the 
larger the department, the more external funding per 
capita is received by the department.  The effect of size 
of the department on research expenditures per capita at 
private institutions is hard to assess, because very few 
small departments at these institutions provided research 
expenditure data this year

increase, while the average at private universities more than 
doubled.  In last year’s report, private universities reported over 
a 14.2 percent decrease.  It is possible that there were some 
inconsistencies between years in departmental reporting.  The 
average number of TAs at I departments rose 15.2 percent 
and the average at Canadian departments rose 64.9 percent.  
The small number of I and Canadian departments make these 
comparative averages subject to volatility.  However, it seems 
safe to say that all types of departments increased their 
average number of TAs this year.  This is consistent with the 
undergraduate enrollment increases reported earlier. 
Following a year of significant decline at both public and private 
universities in the average number of RAs on institutional 
funding, this average more than doubled this year at U.S. public 
universities, and nearly tripled at U.S. private universities.  The 
number of RAs on external funding decreased by 14.6 percent in 
U.S. CS departments at public universities, but increased by 39.7 
percent in departments at private universities.  For the second 
year in a row, we see both public and private institutions 
experiencing just the reverse of what was experienced in the 
previous year’s report. The average number of full-support 
fellows on both internal and external funds declined in U.S. CS 
departments at both public and private universities.    
Table G2 shows the distribution of stipends for TAs, RAs, and 
full-support fellows.  U.S. CS data are further broken down 
in this table by public and private institution. Figures G1-G3 
further break down the U.S. CS data by size of department and 
by geographic location of the university.  
The median TA salaries at U.S. CS departments increased 1.2 
percent at public universities and increased 2.6 percent at private 
universities.  Median salaries of RAs were essentially unchanged 
at public universities but rose 5.9 percent at private universities. 
For full support fellows, median salaries rose 4.1 percent at 
U.S. public universities but declined 13.9 percent at U.S. private 
universities.  Last year, we reported a large increase in the median 
salary of full support fellows at private universities, so there may 
be an error in the data provided to us in one of the years. Through 
further analysis, we also observed that those departments 
from private institutions that reported in this year’s survey 
but not last year’s typically had lower than average stipends. 
Larger departments at U.S. public universities tend to offer higher 
stipends to both TAs and RAs than do smaller departments, and 
private universities tend to offer higher stipends to all categories 
of grad students than do public universities.  As was the case 
last year, departments located in larger population centers also 
tend to pay higher stipends to TAs; the effect of locale on RA 
stipends was less clear this year for both publics and privates, 
and the data for full-support fellows exhibits no clear trend 
relative to locale at public universities.

Faculty Salaries (Tables S1-S21; Figures S1-S9)
Each department was asked to report individual (but 
anonymous) faculty salaries if possible; otherwise, the 
department was requested to provide the mean salary for 
each rank (full, associate, and assistant professors and 
non-tenure-track teaching faculty, research faculty, and 
post-doctorates) and the number of persons at each rank. 
The salaries are those in effect on January 1, 2016. For U.S. 
departments, nine-month salaries are reported in U.S. dollars. 
For Canadian departments, twelve-month salaries are reported 
in Canadian dollars. Respondents were asked to include salary 
supplements such as salary monies from endowed positions.
U.S. CS data are reported in Tables S1-S16 and in the box and 
whiskers diagrams.  Data for CE, I, Canadian and new Ph.D.s 
are reported in Tables S17-S20. The tables and diagrams 
contain distributional data (first decile, quartiles, and ninth 
decile) computed from the department averages only.  Thus, 
for example, a table row labeled “50” or the median line in a

diagram is the median of the averages for the departments 
that reported within the stratum (the number of such 
departments reporting is shown in the “depts” row). It 
therefore is not a true median of all of the salaries. 
We also report salary data for senior faculty based on time 
in rank, for more meaningful comparison of individual or 
departmental faculty salaries with national averages. We report 
associate professor salaries for time in rank of 7 years or less, 
and of more than 7 years. For full professors, we report time in 
rank of 7 years or less, 8 to 15 years, and more than 15 years. 
Those departments reporting salary data were provided a 
summary report in December 2015.  Those departments that 
provided individual salaries were additionally provided more

also is consistent with the pattern in previous years.   
At private institutions last year, senior faculty salaries at  
larger departments did not tend to be higher than those at 
smaller departments.
Viewed relative to type of locale, public institution salaries 
appear to be generally lower in smaller locales for assistant 
professors and early stage associate professors (Tables 
S12-S14), while private institution salaries exhibit no consistent 
pattern relative to type of locale (Tables S15-S16).  These 
observations coincide with those in previous years.
When analyzing the magnitude of faculty salary changes from 
one year to the next, we use only those departments that 
reported both years; otherwise, the departments that reported 
during only one year can skew the comparison.  Because some 
departments that reported both years provided only aggregate 
salaries for their full and associate professors during one 
year and in the other year reported them by years in rank, we 
only report salary changes for all full professors and for all 
associate professors in the year-to-year comparison.  Table S21 
shows, by type of faculty and type of department, the change 
in the median of the average salaries from departments 
that reported both years (the number of departments being 
compared is indicated in the first row of each column).  Using 
the cell showing full professors at U.S. CS departments as an 
example, the table indicates that the median of the 117 average 
salaries for full professors was 4.2 percent higher in 2015 than 
was the median of the average full professor salaries in 2014 
from these same 117 departments.
When interpreting these changes, it is important to remember 
the effect that promotions have on the departmental data 
from one year to the next, since individual faculty members 
move from one rank to another. Thus, a department with a 
small number of faculty members in a particular rank can 
have its average salary in that rank change appreciably (in 
either direction) by a single promotion to or from that rank. 
Departures via resignation or retirement also impact these 
figures, particularly in the non-tenure-track categories. 
Because of the small number of Canadian and Computer 
Engineering departments reporting, the values in those 
columns are considerably more volatile.
For new Ph.D.s in tenure-track positions at U.S. computer 
science, computer engineering, and I-school departments 
(Table S20) the median of the averages was $98,500, an 
increase of 3.5 percent vs. last year. This year there is a 
sufficient number of Canadian institutions to report the median 
of the averages, but in 2014 none were reported, so year-to-
year comparisons cannot be made.

Department Profiles
Every three years, the Taulbee Survey collects data about 
elements of departmental activities that are not expected 
to change much from year to year.  Included are data about 
teaching loads, sources of external funding, methods of 
recruiting graduate students, department support staff, and 
space.  The most recent data about these activities were 
reported in the 2012 Taulbee Survey.  The results of that survey 
are available on the CRA web site at http://cra.org/wp-content/
uploads/2015/01/2012_taulbee_survey.pdf. 
Teaching loads (Tables Prof1-Prof4)
Across all departments, the median teaching load in semester 
courses per year is 3.0, which has not changed over a long 
period of time.  This median also holds true in departments 
at both U.S. CS public and U.S. CS private institutions, and 
at Canadian institutions.  The median at private institutions 
was 2.0 three years ago.  The medians at U.S. CE and U.S. I 
departments are unchanged from three years ago at 4.0 and 
3.5, respectively (Table Prof1).  
Table Prof2 shows whether or not it is possible to increase 
or decrease individual teaching loads from the standards, 
and Tables Prof 3 and Prof 4 indicate why such adjustments 
might be allowed.  As has been the case in previous years, 
nearly every department allows reductions from the standard 
load, with little difference across department types.  However, 
the reasons for reductions do vary across department 
types, with U.S. CS publics generally allowing more possible 
factors to reduce teaching load than do U.S. CS privates.  
Also as in previous years, about 2/3 of all departments allow 
increases, with a greater percentage of publics and Canadian 
departments allowing increases as compared with privates 
and U.S. I departments.  A smaller percentage of departments 
(71 percent) allow increases for shifting primary responsibilities 
to teaching than did previously (76 percent three years ago and 
81 percent six years ago), while a larger percent (29 percent) 
allow increases for other reasons than did previously (24 
percent three years ago and 19 percent six years ago).

Sources of External Funding (Tables R2, R3)
Table R2 shows the distribution of sources of external research 
funding, and its historical values over the five three-year 
intervals during which we have collected such data.  There is 
little difference in the distribution in 2015 compared with 2012.  
The average research support per department increased four 
percent from 2012 to 2015, though this can be highly dependent 
on the particular departments responding; there are fewer 
departments that provided distributional information this year 
than did so in 2012.  NSF continues to be the dominant funder 
of external research, followed by non-DARPA defense funding 
and industry funding.

Other Graduate Student Data (Tables Prof5-Prof7)
Table Prof5 illustrates the factors that are most likely to affect 
graduate student stipends.  Advancement to the next stage 
of study and the source of funding are the most likely factors.  
Stipends are considerably less likely than three years ago to 
be affected by years of service (17 percent vs 25 percent).  Less 
drastic drop-offs in likelihood were present in advancement to 
the next stage of the program (48 percent vs 52 percent) and 
GPA (11 percent vs 13 percent).
Tables Prof6 and Prof7 focus on incentives for recruiting 
graduate students.  Compared with three years ago, a greater 
percentage of departments have one-time signing bonuses 
(12 percent vs 6 percent) while a smaller percentage employ 
stipend enhancements (17 percent vs 25 percent), guaranteed 
multi-year support (51 percent vs 58 percent), and paid visits to 
campus (37 percent vs 42 percent).

Space (Tables Prof8-Prof16)
With the enormous increases in undergraduate enrollments 
since the last survey of department profiles, it is of particular 
interest to see if space has grown during this time.  
Compared with three years ago, median overall department 
space has grown by about 6 percent, the same percentage 
amount that it grew in the previous three years.  Conference 
and seminar space grew the most, by 31 percent, while office 
and laboratory space grew by 11-16 percent (Table Prof8). 
Office space and research lab space grew more at U.S. CS 
public departments than at U.S. CS private departments, while 
conference and research lab space grew more at privates.  
Instructional lab space grew between 22 (privates) and 26 
percent (publics) at U.S. CS departments (Tables Prof9  
and Prof10).
One-quarter of U.S. CS public departments reported definite 
plans to increase space, and one-third of U.S. CS private 
departments did likewise (Table Prof14).  Both of these fractions 
are higher than three years ago, and particularly so for public 
departments, where only 9 percent had definite plans to 
increase space three years ago.

Departmental Support Staff (Tables Prof17-Prof21)
Tables Prof17-Prof22 show the distribution of staffing levels 
based on department type.  Compared with three years ago, the 
median number of administrative and computer support staff 
rose from 5 to 6, and from 2 to 3, respectively.  As was the case 
three years ago, median levels of administrative staff in U.S. CS 
departments are higher at private institutions than at public 
institutions, while median levels of computer support staff 
are similar at public and private institutions.  Higher median 
levels are notable in U.S. I programs for both administrative and 
computer support staff.  This likely is because these units tend 
to be schools rather than departments.

Concluding Observations
The Taulbee Survey clearly documents the continued 
undergraduate enrollment boom being seen in U.S. doctoral-
granting computer science programs.  It also shows that 
departments are adding teaching faculty, TAs and, to a lesser 
extent, tenure-track faculty to their rolls.  CRA is studying 
this enrollment phenomenon in more depth.  A special 
task force led by Tracy Camp will report later this year on 
the results of a more targeted study of the CS enrollment 
boom in both doctoral-granting and non-doctoral-granting 
departments.  Those results should be of interest to all in the 
computing community.

1The title of the survey honors the late Orrin E. Taulbee of the University of Pittsburgh, who conducted these surveys for the 
Computer Science Board until 1984, with retrospective annual data going back to 1970.
2Information (I) programs included here are Information Science, Information Systems, Information Technology, Informatics, and 
related disciplines with a strong computing component. Surveys were sent to CRA members, the CRA Deans group members, 
and participants in the iSchools Caucus (www.ischools.org) who met the criteria of granting Ph.D.s and being located in North 
America. Other I-programs who meet these criteria and would like to participate in the survey in future years are invited to 
contact survey@cra.org for inclusion.
3Classification of the population of an institution’s locale is in accordance with the Carnegie Classification database.  Large cities 
are those with population >= 250,000.  Mid-size cities have population between 100,000 and 250,000.  Town/rural populations are 
less than 100,000.
4All faculty tables: The survey makes no distinction between faculty specializing in CS vs. CE programs. Every effort is made to 
minimize the inclusion of faculty in electrical engineering who are not computer engineers.
