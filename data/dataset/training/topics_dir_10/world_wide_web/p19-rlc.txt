•Text (hypertext, if containing links to other texts)
•Graphics 
•Sound 
•Animations 
•Video 
World Wide Web and Hypertext Transfer Protocol
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 2
•Documents linked together 
•Non-distributed - all documents stored locally (like CD-ROM) 
•Distributed - documents stored on remote servers 
•Link represented by "active area" on screen 
•Graphic - button 
•Text - highlighted 
•Selecting link will fetch referenced document for display 
•Links may become invalid 
•Link is simply a text name for a remote document 
•Remote document may be removed while name in link remains in place 
•Use of local disks for caching pages
•Pages are viewed with programs called browsers (Netscape, Mosaic, Explorer)
- interactive, "point-and-click" interface to hypermedia documents
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 3
•Browser has more components (see next figure):
•Display driver for painting screen 
•HTML interpreter for HTML-formatted documents 
•Other interpreters (e.g., Shockwave) for other items 
•HTTP client to fetch HTML documents from WWW server 
•Other clients for other protocols (e.g., ftp) 
•Controller to accept input from user 
•Must be multi-threaded

Browser Components
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 5
•Downloading documents from servers may be slow
•Internet congested 
•Dialup connection 
•Server busy 
•Returning to previous (HTML) document requires reload from server 
•Local cache can be used to hold copies of visited pages 
•Also can implement organizational HTTP proxy that caches documents for 
multiple users 
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 6
Document representation
Each www document is called a page
•Initial page for individual or organization is called a home page
•Page can contain many different types of information; page must specify 
•Content 
•Type of content 
•Location 
•Links 
•Rather than fixed WYSIWYG representation (e.g., Word), pages are formatted with a 
mark up language (like TeX) 
•Allows browser to reformat, to fit display 
•Allows text-only browser to discard graphics 
•Standard is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
-Markup: everything in a document that is not content
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 7
•Page identified by: 
Protocol used to access page, computer on which page is stored, TCP port to 
access page (optional) and pathname of the file on server 
•Each link is specified in HTML 
•Item on page is associated with another HTML document 
•Need for mechanisms for naming, locating & accessing pages
•Specific syntax for page’s worldwide name: Uniform Resource Locator
(URL): protocol://computer_name:port/document_name
•protocol can be http, ftp, file, mailto
•computer name is DNS name 
•(Optional) port is TCP port 
•document_name is path on computer to page
Generalized URL, making possible page replication (don’t care where getting page) 
Universal Resource Identifier (URI), allowing less resources for common pages
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 8
HTML – short survey
Evolved from Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), specialized for 
hypertext and adapted to the Web
HTML specifies how documents are to be formatted
•Major structure of document 
•Formatting instructions 
•Hypermedia links 
•Additional information about document contents 
•Two parts to document: 
•Head contains details about the document 
•Body contains information/content 
•Page is represented in ASCII text with embedded HTML tags formatting instructions 
•Tags have format <TAGNAME>
•End of formatted section is </TAGNAME>
•Commands inside the tags: directives
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 9
Main HTML Tags
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 10
HTML Evolution
HTML 1.0 – one way, e.g. users could only call up pages, hard to send back
information
⇒Inclusion of forms, containing boxes or buttons, allowing users for info filling or 
make choices and sending info back to the page’s owner
Form enclosed between <FORM> and </FORM> tags
One standard to handle forms’ data: Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
Example: CGI programs (scripts) allow interface between a data base and the Web
Dynamic Web pages (higher interactivity between user & pages, continuous page 
updating) are designed using other methodologies, as:
-server side scripting technologies (JSP – Java Server Pages, ASP – Active Server 
Pages, PHP – Perl Helper Pages, ColdFusion)
-active Web documents (moves computation to the browser), using Java technologies 
(JavaScripts)
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 11
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
Underlying protocol of the World Wide Web
Not a protocol for transferring hypertext
For transmitting information with efficiency necessary for hypertext jumps
HTTP specifies commands and client-server interaction 
Can transfer plain text, hypertext, audio, images, and Internet accessible 
information
HTTP Overview
Transaction oriented client/server protocol
Usually between Web browser (client) and Web server
Uses TCP connections
Stateless
Each transaction treated independently
Each new TCP connection for each transaction
Terminate connection when transaction complete
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 12
Client/Server model:
– client: browser that requests, receives, “displays” WWW objects
– server: WWW server daemon, sends objects in response to client requests
Functionality:
– client initiates TCP connection (creates socket) to server, port 80
– server accepts TCP connection from client
– HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between 
browser (HTTP client) and WWW server (HTTP server)
– TCP connection closed
HTTP is “stateless”: server maintains no information about past client requests
http1.0: RFC 1945
http1.1: RFC 2068

Key Terms
Cache
Client
Connection
Entity
Gateway
Message
Origin server
Proxy
Resource
Server
Tunnel
User agent
Examples of HTTP operations:
-direct connection with origin server; client opens an end-to-end 
TCP connection and issues a HTTP request. It consists of a 
specific command (OO: method), a URL & a MIME-like 
message with request parameters, info about client, etc. Server 
receives the request, process it & return HTTP response, 
containing status & error info, MIME-like message with info 
about server, about response and the body content. Finally the 
TCP connection is closed.
-Intermediate systems with TCP connections (relaying requests 
& responses)
-Example of a cache: an intermediate system stores previous 
requests & responses, for handling new requests; no need to 
access the origin server; caching time limit

Intermediate HTTP Systems
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 16
Intermediate Systems
HTTP defines three forms of intermediate systems:
-Proxy, acting on behalf of clients, forwarding their requests; is a server in 
interacting with client & client vs. server; is on the client side within a firewall; 
presents clients’ requests to server, over an authenticated connection; may also 
implement different versions of HTTP
-Gateway, appears as server to client (acts on behalf of servers); is on the server part 
on a firewall; allows for accessing servers running other protocols than HTTP (FTP, 
Gopher servers)
-Tunnel, relay between TCP connections; no extra info check; example: a firewall 
in which a client & a server maintains a secure connection for purposes of HTTP 
transactions
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 17
HTTP Messages (Protocol data units)
Implementation for:
Requests
Client to server
Responses
Server to client
Structure:
Request line – message type and requested resource
Response line – status information about message
General header – applies to both request/response messages
Request header – info about request and client
Response header – info about response  and server
Entity header – info about the resource target of the request
Entity body – body of the message

Multimedia Networking
Impacts of multimedia networking:
– Users can choose when they want content (such as TV and radio programs) 
delivered, rather than needing to watch/listen when the content is broadcasted
– Telephone service and data networking will tend to converge
– Two-way video conferencing will often be used instead of telephony
– E-mail will integrate with voice mail (e-mail messages will be spoken rather than
Typed)
– Voice/video e-mail: video can be included along with speech
– Multi-way video conferencing already allows virtual meetings and conferences
– As these technologies improve, the need for travel will decrease
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 19
Ingredients:
– entertainment video
– IP telephony (or voice-over-IP, VOIP)
– Internet radio
– Multimedia web sites
– teleconferencing, both 2 party and multi-party (e. g. the Access Grid Node).
– interactive games
– virtual worlds (which overlaps with interactive games)
Multimedia Application Specificity
-highly sensitive to end-to-end delay and delay variation (jitter)
-service requirements are quite different from those of traditional data applications
-attempts to extend the Internet architecture to provide explicit support for the service 
requirements of multimedia applications (reservation techniques, differentiated 
services)
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 20
How should the Internet evolve to support multimedia?
– One view: no fundamental changes are necessary
There should be more use of multicast and caching
More bandwidth should be added to links, and more router capacity should be added
– Another view: applications should be able to reserve end-to-end bandwidth
A protocol to allow applications to reserve bandwidth is needed
Router scheduling policies must take these reservations into account
Some packets will get preferential packets, and probably the senders of those packets 
will have to pay more.
Applications must be able to describe the traffic that they intend to send
The network must have a means to determine whether it has the bandwidth necessary to 
support a reservation request
– An intermediate view: a differentiated services model
A small number of classes of service
IP Datagrams get different levels of service depending on their service level.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 21
Service characteristics
– Multimedia applications are delay-sensitive and loss-tolerant
– Most data applications are delay-insensitive and loss-intolerant
– TCP/IP was designed for data applications, whereas ATM was designed for both data 
and multimedia; TCP/IP seems to have mostly prevailed over ATM, so we are faced
with adding ATM-like features to TCP/IP (example: reserving network resources 
between two endpoints requires that something like a virtual circuit be set up and
intermediate routers must be aware of the flow between the endpoints)
– Specific Problems
-network-induced jitter. Some solutions: client buffering, packet sequence 
numbers, packet timestamps.
-lost packets. Some solutions: forward error correction, sending periodic parity 
packets, sending a redundant lower-quality delayed stream
-interleaving
-media encapsulation: RTP and RTCP
– Real-time audio/video conferencing: H.323, an “umbrella protocol”.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 22
Service models for the Internet
The network-layer protocol of today’s Internet provides a “best-effort” service
No promises are made for end-to-end delay nor for variation in end-to-end delay 
(packet jitter)
Since the Internet service model is not appropriate for multimedia applications, it is 
challenging to develop such applications, and performance is unsatisfactory when 
networks are congested
Methods for overcoming these limitations:
– Use UDP rather than TCP, which avoids TCP congestion control such as slow-start.
– Delay playback at the receiver, so that late packets can be used. This is more 
feasible for non-interactive applications
– Timestamp packets at the sender so that the receiver knows when they should be 
played
– Prefetch stored data at times when extra bandwidth is available
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 23
Examples of Multimedia Applications
Streaming and stored audio and video
Distinguishing features:
– Stored media: The multimedia content is stored at the server
-user may pause, rewind, fast-forward, or index through the content.
-acceptable response time is from 1 to 10 seconds
– Streaming: A client begins playout of the content a few seconds after it begins 
receiving the file from the server.
-client will be playing out content from one location while receiving later parts
Products include RealPlayer and Windows Media Player.
– Continuous playout
-once playout begins, it should proceed according to the original timing of the 
recording
-if data is received after it should be played, then the data is useless.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 24
Streaming of Live Audio and Video
-includes radio and television broadcast over the Internet
-fast-forward is not possible
-pausing and rewinding can be implemented with local storage
-currently most often implemented using multiple unicast sessions.
-Access Grid is implemented using multicast.
Real-time Interactive Audio and Video
-includes Internet Phone
-it sets constraints on delay
-for voice, delays smaller than 150 milliseconds are not perceived 
by a human listener
-delays of 150 to 400 milliseconds are acceptable
-delays of over 400 milliseconds tend to be unacceptable

General Architecture of Audio/Video Systems
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 26
Audio and Video Compression
Before sending audio and video over the network, it must be digitized and compressed
Uncompressed video is extremely large, so compression is almost a necessity
Very high compression ratios are often possible for video
Audio digitization techniques
– Pulse code modulation (PCM): samples the audio signal at some fixed rate, and then 
represents each sample with some number of bits; standard telephone digitization 
samples at 8000 times per second, and then encodes each sample with 256 quantization 
values => an uncompressed signal of 64 Kbps
- not very good fidelity, is not suitable for music
- audio compact disks also use PCM: audio CDs sample at 44,100 samples per 
second, and use 16 bits per sample; results in a rate of 705.6 Kbps for mono 
transmissions or 1.411 Mbps for stereo.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 27
Audio compression
– GSM issues (13 Kbps rate)
– G.729 (8 Kbps)
– MP3 (MPEG layer 3 standard): 128 or 112 Kbps - can be used for streaming audio
– Proprietary standards
Video compression
- Use of MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) standards:
- MPEG 1 for CD-ROM quality video (1.5 Mbps)
– MPEG 2 for DVD quality video (3-6 Mbps)
– MPEG 4 for object-oriented video compression
– H.261, under H.323 umbrella
– Proprietary standards.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 28
Streaming Stored Audio and Video
Clients request compressed audio/video files that are resident on servers
The server sends the file to the client over a socket, either TCP or UDP
A protocol such as real-time protocol (RTP) is used to encapsulate segments of the 
file with special headers
When the file starts to arrive at the client, typically it is played within a few seconds
A protocol such as real-time streaming protocol (RTSP) can be used to give 
interactivity, such as: pause/resume and jumps within the file
A media player application (a web-browser plugin) performs the following functions:
– Decompression
– Jitter removal: done by buffering the signal
– Error correction. Three techniques:
Redundant packets and error-correcting codes
Client requests retransmission of lost packets
Interpolating the lost data from the received data
– provides a GUI (Graphic User Interface) with control knobs.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 29
Accessing Audio and Video from a Web Server
Normally, the media will be stored as files (compressed) on the server
In the case of video, there may be separate audio and video files, or they might be 
interleaved in the same file
It is the responsibility of the media player to manage synchronization of the two 
streams
For simplicity, we assume that there is only one file
A possible architecture:
– The browser connects to the web server
– The browser requests the audio/video file with an HTTP request message
– The web server sends the file to the browser in an HTTP response message
– The browser looks at the content type, launches the media player if necessary, and 
forwards the file to the media player
– The media player renders the audio/video file
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 30
One drawback: the browser is an intermediary between the server and the media
player => the file would need to be completely downloaded before it gets forwarded to 
the media player
It makes it more difficult for the media player to allow the user to control the stream.
A better method is to make use of a meta file, which provides information (e. g., the 
location and encoding) about the audio/video file => the browser passes the meta file to 
the media player, and the media player makes its own connection to the server
This server may be a streaming server rather than a web server (may be specifically 
designed to deliver streaming media, and may run a different protocol than HTTP)
Options for delivering the audio/video from the streaming server to the client:
1. The server sends the stream over UDP at the encoded rate of the audio/video (drain
rate.) The client decompresses and plays the stream as it receives it.
2. Same, but the media player delays playout for 2-5 seconds in order to eliminate 
network-induced jitter (the client buffers the incoming stream)
3. The stream is sent over TCP, and the media player buffers the stream for 2-5 sec. It 
gives TCP the chance to retransm t lost packets, but the flow & congestion control of 
TCP might interfere with sending the stream at the drain rate.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 31
RTSP (Real-Time Streaming Protocol)
RTSP is an out-of-band protocol that allows a media player to control the 
transmission of a media stream
– Out-of-band protocol means that RTSP messages are sent over a separate channel 
from the media itself
– RTSP does not specify how the media is compressed, encapsulated in packets, 
transported, or buffered
RTP (Real Time Protocol)
RTP is a protocol that provides for a standard packet structure that includes fields for 
sequence numbers, timestamps, etc. RTP typically runs on top of UDP.
Each source (e. g., camera or microphone) can be assigned its own independent 
stream of RTP packets
RTP can be sent over unicast of multicast.
Multiple RTP streams belonging to a single application can make up an RTP 
session.
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 32
The RTP header fields:
– The payload type gives the compression method
– The sequence number field is 16 bits long, and can be used to detect packet loss
– The timestamp field is 32 bits long, and it reflects the sampling instant of the first 
byte in the RTP packet
– The synchronization source identifier (SSRC) is 32 bits long, and identifies the 
source of the RTP stream
Typically, each stream in the RTP session has a distinct SSRC. The SSRC is chosen 
randomly.
RTCP (Real Time Control Protocol)
Typically used by participants using RTP in a multicast scenario
RTCP packets are sent periodically and contain sender and/or receiver reports and 
statistics than can be useful to applications
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 33
H.323
H.323 is a standard for real-time audio and video conferencing among end systems on 
the Internet; also covers how end systems on the Internet communicate with ordinary 
circuit-switched telephone networks. It means:
The products of Internet telephony and videoconferencing that use H.323 should
be able to interoperate and should be able to communicate with ordinary telephones
H.323 is an umbrella specification that includes:
-A specification for how endpoints negotiate audio/video encodings.
-A specification for how audio and video chunks are encapsulated and sent 
over the network; this is done by means of RTP
-A specification for how endpoints communicate with their respective 
gatekeepers
- A specification for how Internet phones communicate with ordinary phones
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 34
H.323 components
End points can be 
standalone devices or 
computer applications
Gateways permit 
communication among 
H.323 endpoints and 
ordinary telephones
Gatekeepers (optional) 
provide address translation, 
authorization, bandwidth 
management, and
accounting for LAN 
terminals
04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 35
H.323 endpoints must support the following protocols:
G.711 PCM (pulse code modulation) speech encoding
Real-Time Protocol
H.245: an “out-of-band” protocol for controlling media between H.323 endpoints
Q.931: a signaling protocol for establishing and terminating calls. Provides for 
interoperability with traditional telephones.
RAS: a protocol that allows endpoints to communicate with a gatekeeper
(see next figure)
H.323 channels
An endpoint maintains several channels
The H.245 control channel is a TCP connection that is used for capability exchanged 
and opening and closing media channels
H.245 is similar in purpose to RTSP (which is used for stored media and streaming 
sessions)
Q.931 provides traditional telephone functionality.

04/11/2008 Vasile Dadarlat - Computer Networks 37
Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
Application level signaling protocol
Allows creating, modifying & terminating sessions with more participants
Supports user location, call setup, call transfers, mobility (by proxying & redirection)
Used by the gateways to setup connections
SIP works in conjunction with IP protocols: 
RSVP for reserving resources
RTP/RTCP/RTSP for transporting real-time data
SAP (Session Announcement Protocol) – advertise multimedia session
SDP (Session Description Protocol)
Can use TCP/UDP
Text based
