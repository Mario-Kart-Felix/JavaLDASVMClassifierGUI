OVERVIEW: 
 
Program Development And Goal: 
 
The Masters Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of 
South Florida represents a multi-college partnership and a truly interdisciplinary 
collaboration.  Participating departments include the Departments of Molecular Medicine 
(formerly Biochemistry & Molecular Biology) in the College of Medicine, Mathematics in 
the College of Arts and Sciences, Computer Sciences and Engineering and the Division 
of Biomedical Engineering in the College of Engineering, Epidemiology & Biostatistics in 
the College of Public Health and Information Systems & Decision Sciences in the 
College of Business Administration.  The program is designed to meet the increasing 
demand for trained people in this emerging area, which crosses the traditional fields of 
biological, mathematical and computer sciences.  The program, therefore, builds on and 
complements the current strengths of the university. 
 
The Masters Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology was initiated and will 
be administered by the Departments of Molecular Medicine in the College of Medicine.  
The program development has been supported by a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan 
Foundation. At this time, only 13 institutions across the nation have won the highly 
competitive Sloan Awards to develop intensive two-year professional Master's degree 
programs in the rapidly growing field of bioinformatics and computational biology. 
 
The goal of the Masters Program in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology is to 
provide students enrolled in the program with high quality training and education that 
will prepare them for careers in science, industry, health care and education.  The 
curriculum has been designed accordingly and provides the theoretical background, the 
practical training and, with the internships, the “real life” experience, which will equip 
students with the essential tools for a successful career in the field of Bioinformatics & 
Computational Biology. 
 
 
Program Description: 
 
The Masters Program in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology is designed for 42 
credit hours to be obtained during two years of study. Nine core courses will provide the 
foundation and basics before advanced work, including four electives, and a Master’s 
thesis or internship will be pursued.  The curriculum is flexible and will be tailored to the 
individual student’s background, interests and career goals.  However, electives must 
be selected from at least two of the participating departments to assure breadth of 
training. 
 
Exceptional students with extra motivation and commitment can enroll in the Ph.D.-
PLUS program. The Ph.D.-PLUS program provides the opportunity to study for a Ph.D. 
in Molecular Medicine and a Master’s degree in Bioinformatics and Computational 
Biology concurrently.  Nine credit hours can be double credited.

treatments including gene therapy, stem cell therapy and pharmacogenomics will also 
be discussed. 
 
GMS 6889  Advanced Bioinformatics  
Advanced Bioinformatics is designed to provide an in depth analysis of DNA and protein 
function using information derived from both current DNA and protein sequence

EMPLOYMENT PERSPECTIVES IN BIOINFORMATICS 
 
 
http://www.aw-bc.com/info/campbell_krane/1_faq.html 
What prospects  are there for work in bioinformatics in the future? 
There is already an extensive need for professionals with a background in 
bioinformatics and that need will continue to grow. For instance, the genomic 
information available at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) 
currently doubles every 14 months and industry analysts forecast that the market for 
genomic information alone (and the technology to use it) will reach an annual US $2 
billion by 2005. The current shortfall of bioinformaticians has been estimated to be as 
much as fifty-fold! 
 
 
http://www.bio-itworld.com/archive/061202/class.html 
Demand for the marriage of biology and IT skills 
The demand for the marriage of biology and IT skills is a recent phenomenon, with the 
higher priority placed on a biological background, according to Boston-area recruiting 
firm Remington International, which also notes starting salaries of $60,000 to $90,000 
are typical for qualified applicants. 
 
 
http://www.nature.com/drugdisc/nj/articles/nj6939-566a.html 
Short supply 
Improving proteomic techniques will tackle questions in cell biology, signal transduction 
and clinical research. But workers with the key knowledge in protein biochemistry, mass 
spectrometry and bioinformatics are hard to find, says Kendall Powell.  
 
John Bergeron is being swamped. His team feeds peptide after peptide, isolated from a 
range of cellular components, into the lab's mass spectrometer, which in turn churns out 
reams of data. The researchers then scramble to use this information to identify new 
proteins and the cellular processes in which they are involved. Even though only a 
quarter or so of the proteins are identified, Bergeron says that his group at McGill 
University in Montreal, Canada, can barely keep up. Bergeron's experience is not 
unique — he, along with colleagues in North America and Europe, is finding it difficult to 
find qualified scientists to help tame the outpouring of protein data. 
 
 
Areas of employment for bioinformaticians 
Published by the Institute of BioScience and Technology © Cranfield University 
 
The pharmaceutical industry:  The considerable potential for the discovery of new drugs 
has ensured that pharmaceutical companies are the predominant investors in 
bioinformatics, and a major employer of bioinformaticians.  As bioinformatics 
technologies are applied not only in early discovery but all along the drug discovery 
process, the demand for bioinformaticians is unlikely to diminish in the near future.  
                                 
The bioinformatics industry: In recent years, many new companies have been 
established solely to provide bioinformatics products and services. Activities are 
focussed mainly on the development of software and databases, but also include work 
related to business issues and intellectual property rights.  Students with the mix of 
biology, computing and commercial expertise gained on the Cranfield course have the 
potential to progress rapidly in these companies.  
                                 
 15 
 
The biotechnology industry: Aside from pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics promises to aid 
research and development in many other areas, including medical diagnostics, 
pathology, genetic engineering and the next generation of high throughput biological 
data acquisition.  The IT industry: The rise of bioinformatics has generated a substantial 
new market for IT infrastructure and services, with many companies seeing strong 
opportunities for growth in the life sciences. 
 
 
Sloan Foundation: 
A 1999 study commissioned by the Sloan Foundation indicated that entry level salaries 
for graduates of Masters programs ranged from $45,000-$100,000.  It was also 
estimated that current “supply” is sufficient to satisfy only 15% of the “demand” for 
students trained in bioinformatics and computational biology and demand appears to be 
increasing.

 FLORIDA BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES 
 
"Through an extensive research and interviewing process, Enterprise 
Florida developed a database of Florida-based biotechnology 
companies. There are currently over 80 Florida companies that apply 
biological knowledge and techniques pertaining to molecular, cellular, 
and genetic processes to develop products and services, including 
applications in medicine, agriculture, and environmental management. 
This database does not include biotech services companies."
