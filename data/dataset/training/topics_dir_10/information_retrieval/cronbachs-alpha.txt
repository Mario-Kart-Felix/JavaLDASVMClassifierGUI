Medical educators attempt to create reliable and valid tests 
and questionnaires in order to enhance the accuracy of 
their assessment and evaluations. Validity and reliability 
are two fundamental elements in the evaluation of a 
measurement instrument.  Instruments can be convention-
al knowledge, skill or attitude tests, clinical simulations or 
survey questionnaires. Instruments can measure concepts, 
psychomotor skills or affective values. Validity is con-
cerned with the extent to which an instrument measures 
what it is intended to measure.  Reliability is concerned 
with the ability of an instrument to measure consistently.1 
It should be noted that the reliability of an instrument is 
closely associated with its validity. An instrument cannot 
be valid unless it is reliable. However, the reliability of an 
instrument does not depend on its validity.2 It is possible to 
objectively measure the reliability of an instrument and in 
this paper we explain the meaning of Cronbach’s alpha, the 
most widely used objective measure of reliability.  
Calculating alpha has become common practice in 
medical education research when multiple-item measures 
of a concept or construct are employed. This is because it is 
easier to use in comparison to other estimates (e.g. test-
retest reliability estimates)3 as it only requires one test 
administration. However, in spite of the widespread use of 
alpha in the literature the meaning, proper use and inter-
pretation of alpha is not clearly understood. 2, 4, 5 We feel it 
is important, therefore, to further explain the underlying 
assumptions behind alpha in order to promote its more 
effective use.  It should be emphasised that the purpose of 
this brief overview is just to focus on Cronbach’s alpha as 
an index of reliability. Alternative methods of measuring 
reliability based on other psychometric methods, such as 
generalisability theory or item-response theory, can be used 
for monitoring and improving the quality of OSCE exami-
nations 6-10, but will not be discussed here. 
What is Cronbach alpha? 
Alpha was developed by Lee Cronbach in 195111 to provide 
a measure of the internal consistency of a test or scale; it is 
expressed as a number between 0 and 1. Internal consisten-
cy describes the extent to which all the items in a test 
measure the same concept or construct and hence it is 
connected to the inter-relatedness of the items within the 
test. Internal consistency should be determined before a 
test can be employed for research or examination purposes 
to ensure validity. In addition, reliability estimates show 
the amount of measurement error in a test. Put simply, this 
interpretation of reliability is the correlation of test with 
itself. Squaring this correlation and subtracting from 1.00 
produces the index of measurement error.  For example, if 
a test has a reliability of 0.80, there is 0.36 error variance 
(random error) in the scores (0.80×0.80 = 0.64; 1.00 – 0.64 
= 0.36).12 As the estimate of reliability increases, the frac-
tion of a test score that is attributable to error will de-
crease.2 It is of note that the reliability of a test reveals the 
effect of measurement error on the observed score of a 
student cohort rather than on an individual student. To 
calculate the effect of measurement error on the observed 
score of an individual student, the standard error of 
measurement must be calculated (SEM).13    
If the items in a test are correlated to each other, the 
value of alpha is increased. However, a high coefficient 
alpha does not always mean a high degree of internal 
consistency. This is because alpha is also affected by the 
length of the test. If the test length is too short, the value of 
alpha is reduced.2, 14 Thus, to increase alpha, more related 
items testing the same concept should be added to the test.  
It is also important to note that alpha is a property of the 
scores on a test from a specific sample of testees. Therefore 
investigators should not rely on published alpha estimates 
and should measure alpha each time the test is adminis-
tered.14   
Use of Cronbach’s alpha  
Improper use of alpha can lead to situations in which either 
a test or scale is wrongly discarded or the test is criticised 
for not generating trustworthy results. To avoid this 
situation an understanding of the associated concepts of 
internal consistency, homogeneity or unidimensionality 
can help to improve the use of alpha. Internal consistency 
is concerned with the interrelatedness of a sample of test 
items, whereas homogeneity refers to unidimensionality. A 
measure is said to be unidimensional if its items measure a 
single latent trait or construct.   Internal consistency is a 
Tavakol et al.  Cronbach’s alpha 
54 
 
necessary but not sufficient condition for measuring 
homogeneity or unidimensionality in a sample of test 
items.5, 15 Fundamentally, the concept of reliability assumes 
that unidimensionality exists in a sample of test items16 and 
if this assumption is violated it does cause a major underes-
timate of reliability. It has been well documented that a 
multidimensional test does not necessary have a lower 
alpha than a unidimensional test. Thus a more rigorous 
view of alpha is that it cannot simply be interpreted as an 
index for the internal consistency of a test. 5, 15, 17  
Factor Analysis can be used to identify the dimensions 
of a test.18 Other reliable techniques have been used and we 
encourage the reader to consult the paper “Applied Dimen-
sionality and Test Structure Assessment with the START-
M Mathematics Test” and to compare methods for as-
sessing the dimensionality and underlying structure of a 
test.19  
Alpha, therefore, does not simply measure the unidi-
mensionality of a set of items, but can be used to confirm 
whether or not a sample of items is actually unidimension-
al.5 On the other hand if a test has more than one concept 
or construct, it may not make sense to report alpha for the 
test as a whole as the larger number of questions will 
inevitable inflate the value of alpha. In principle therefore, 
alpha should be calculated for each of the concepts rather 
than for the entire test or scale. 2, 3 The implication for a 
summative examination containing heterogeneous, case-
based questions is that alpha should be calculated for each 
case.  
More importantly, alpha is grounded in the ‘tau equiva-
lent model’ which assumes that each test item measures the 
same latent trait on the same scale. Therefore, if multiple 
factors/traits underlie the items on a scale, as revealed by 
Factor Analysis, this assumption is violated and alpha 
underestimates the reliability of the test.17 If the number of 
test items is too small it will also violate the assumption of 
tau-equivalence and will underestimate reliability.20 When 
test items meet the assumptions of the tau-equivalent 
model, alpha approaches a better estimate of reliability.  In 
practice, Cronbach’s alpha is a lower-bound estimate of 
reliability because heterogeneous test items would violate 
the assumptions of the tau-equivalent model.5 If the 
calculation of “standardised item alpha” in SPSS is higher 
than “Cronbach’s alpha”, a further examination of the tau-
equivalent measurement in the data may be essential.    
Numerical values of alpha   
As pointed out earlier, the number of test items, item inter-
relatedness and dimensionality affect the value of alpha.5 
There are different reports about the acceptable values of 
alpha, ranging from 0.70 to 0.95. 2, 21, 22 A low value of alpha 
could be due to a low number of questions, poor inter-
relatedness between items or heterogeneous constructs. For 
example if a low alpha is due to poor correlation between 
items then some should be revised or discarded. The easiest 
method to find them is to compute the correlation of each 
test item with the total score test; items with low correla-
tions (approaching zero) are deleted. If alpha is too high it 
may suggest that some items are redundant as they are 
testing the same question but in a different guise. A maxi-
mum alpha value of 0.90 has been recommended.14  
Summary 
High quality tests are important to evaluate the reliability 
of data supplied in an examination or a research study.  
Alpha is a commonly employed index of test reliability. 
Alpha is affected by the test length and dimensionality. 
Alpha as an index of reliability should follow the assump-
tions of the essentially tau-equivalent approach. A low 
alpha appears if these assumptions are not meet. Alpha 
does not simply measure test homogeneity or unidimen-
sionality as test reliability is a function of test length. A 
longer test increases the reliability of a test regardless of 
whether the test is homogenous or not. A high value of 
alpha (> 0.90) may suggest redundancies and show that the 
test length should be shortened. 
Conclusions  
Alpha is an important concept in the evaluation of assess-
ments and questionnaires. It is mandatory that assessors 
and researchers should estimate this quantity to add 
validity and accuracy to the interpretation of their data. 
Nevertheless alpha has frequently been reported in an 
uncritical way and without adequate understanding and 
interpretation. In this editorial we have attempted to 
explain the assumptions underlying the calculation of 
alpha, the factors influencing its magnitude and the ways in 
which its value can be interpreted. We hope that investiga-
tors in future will be more critical when reporting values of 
alpha in their studies.
