Course Overview
• Administrivia
• Why are networks important?
• What is a network?
• What is the Internet
• Internet design
• A whirlwind tour of the course
What is a Network?
• An infrastructure that allows (distributed) 
“users” to communicate with each other
• People, devices, …
• By means of voice, video, text, …
• Focus on electrical/optical/RF/.. (not trucks)
• It is assumed that the infrastructure is 
shared by many users
• Point to point link is not very interesting
• Value increases with the number of users!
15
Basic Building Block: Links
• Simplest example: 2 nodes
• Sender changes voltage, 
frequency, …
• Or maybe it is optical or 
wireless?
• But receiver must “understand” 
sender – protocols
• More on this later
• Okay… what about more 
nodes?
• How about a million?

But First
a bit of 
History
Communication Network Architecture
• Network architecture: the plan that specifies how 
the network is built and operated
• Architecture is driven by the network services
• Overall communication process is complex
• Network architecture partitions overall 
communication process into separate functional 
areas called layers - more on this later
Next we will trace evolution of three network 
architectures:  telegraph, telephone, and 
computer networks

Network Architecture Evolution
• Telegraph Networks
• Message switching & digital transmission
• Telephone Networks
• Circuit Switching
• Analog transmission → digital transmission  
→ mobile 
• Internet
• Packet switching & computer applications
• Increasingly faster, more diverse edge & apps
• Next generation Internet ???

Telegraphs & Long-Distance 
Message Communications
• Courier:  physical transport of the message
• Messenger pigeons, pony express, FedEx
• Telegraph: message is transmitted across a 
network using signals – much faster!
• Drums, beacons, mirrors, smoke, flags, 
• Light, electricity
Message Switching Architecture
• Network nodes were created 
where several optical telegraph 
lines met (Paris and other sites)
• Store-and-Forward Operation:
• Messages arriving on each line 
were decoded
• Next-hop in route determined by 
destination address of a message
• Each message was carried by 
hand to next line, and stored until 
operator became available for next 
transmission

• Electric telegraph networks exploded
• Message switching & Store-and-Forward operation
• Key elements:  Addressing, Routing, Forwarding
• Optical telegraph networks disappeared
Electric Telegraph Networks Bell’s Telephone
• Alexander Graham Bell (1875) working on harmonic 
telegraph to multiplex telegraph signals
• Discovered voice signals can be transmitted directly
• Microphone converts voice pressure variation (sound) 
into analogous electrical signal
• Loudspeaker converts electrical signal back into sound 
• Telephone patent granted in 1876
• Bell Telephone Company founded in 1877

Circuit Switching
• Source first establishes a connection (circuit) to the 
destination
• Each switch along the way stores info about connection (and 
possibly allocates resources)
• Source sends the data over the circuit
• No need to include the destination address with the data since the 
switches know the path
• The connection is explicitly torn down
• Example: telephone network (analog)

Circuit Switching Discussion
• Circuits have some very attractive properties. 
• Fast and simple data transfer, once the circuit has been 
established
• Predictable performance since the circuit provides isolation 
from other users
• E.g. guaranteed bandwidth
• But it also has some shortcomings.
• How about bursty traffic?
• Do you need a permanent circuit to Facebook?
• Circuit will be idle for significant periods of time
• How about users with different bandwidth needs?
28
Page 8
Contrast this with Message
(Packet) Switching (our emphasis)
• Source sends information as self-contained messages that 
have an address.
• Source may have to break up single message in multiple packets
• Each packet travels independently to the destination host.
• Switches use the address in the packet to determine how to 
forward the packets
• Store and forward
• Analogy: a letter in surface mail.
29
And Some More Examples …
• Television network
• Over the air
• Cable TV
• Satellite
• Radio broadcast
• Various private networks
• E.g., for first responders, military, ..

Today’s Lecture
• Administrivia
• Why are networks important?
• What is a network?
• What is the Internet
• Internet design
• A whirlwind tour of the course
32
What about the Internet
• An inter-net: a network of 
networks.
• Networks are connected using 
routers and other devices, e.g., 
for security, accounting, …
• Networks can use diverse 
technologies
• Typically managed by different 
organization
• The Internet: the interconnected 
set of networks of the Internet 
Service Providers (ISPs)
• About ~23,000 “transit” ISPs 
make up the Internet
• Many more “edge” networks
33
Internet
Page 9
What is the 
Objective of the Internet?
• Enable communication between diverse applications on 
diverse devices (“computers”)
• Web, peer-to-peer, video streaming, distributed processing, video 
and audio conferencing, …
• Over very diverse infrastructures
• The “Internet”, WiFi and cellular, data center networks, corporate 
networks, dedicated private networks, …
• In contrast: previous networks were special purpose and 
fairly homogeneous in terms of technology
• Must understand application needs/demands (Thursday)
• Traffic data rate and loss sensitivity
• Traffic pattern (bursty or constant bit rate)
• Traffic target (multipoint or single destination, mobile or fixed)
34
Packet Switching –
Statistical Multiplexing
• Switches arbitrate between inputs
• Can send from any input that’s ready
• Links are never idle when there is traffic to send
• (Efficiency!)
Packets
35
Multiplexing
• Need to share network resources
• How?  Switched network
• Party “A” gets resources sometimes
• Party “B” gets them sometimes
• Interior nodes act as “Switches”
• Many challenges: fairness, efficiency, …
36
Internet Design
• In order to inter-operate, all participating 
networks must follow a common set of rules
• Example: requirements for packets:
• Address format, header information, packet size limit, ..
• But also: routing, error reporting, billing, …
• Also: what is the “service model”, i.e., the 
commitment made to applications
• Internet:  best-effort – packets can get lost, etc.
• But some applications need reliable data delivery, a 
minimal bandwidth guarantee, low latency, …
37
Page 10
Networks Juggle Many Goals
• Support rich set of applications
• Efficiency – resource use;  cost
• The “ilities”:
• Evolvability
• Managability
• Security  (securability, if you must)
• Ease of:
• Deployment, management
• Creating useful applications
• Scalability
38
Must also Deal with “Real World”
• Economics and public policy play a big role in the 
design of the Internet
• ISPs are competing for customers but they must also 
work together
• They must make money – no ISPs, no Internet
• Public policy looks after user interests and tries to 
promote competition and innovation
• Users will only use the network if they get value 
out of it
• Concerns such as privacy can stifle use
39
Success Factors for New Services
• Technology not only factor in success of a new service
• Three factors considered in new telecom services
Technology
Market
Regulation
Can it be 
implemented 
cost-
effectively?
Can there be 
demand for the 
service?
Is the service 
allowed?
New 
Service
Transmission Technology
• Relentless improvement in transmission
• High-speed transmission in copper pairs
• DSL Internet Access
• Higher call capacity in cellular networks
• Lower cost cellular phone service
• Enormous capacity and reach in optical fiber
• Plummeting cost for long distance telephone
• Allows innovation in applications, services
• E-mail  chat  audio  video
• Peer to peer, cloud computing
Page 11
Processing Technology
• Relentless improvement in processing & storage
• Moore’s Law:  doubling of transistors per 
integrated circuit every two years
• RAM:  larger tables, larger systems
• Digital signal processing:  transmission, 
multiplexing, framing, error control, encryption
• Network processors:  hardware for routing, 
switching, forwarding, and traffic management

applications
• Higher speeds and higher throughputs in network 
protocols and applications

• The network effect:  usefulness of a service 
increases with size of community
• Metcalfe's Law: usefulness is proportional to the 
square of the number of users
• Phone, fax, email, ICQ, …
• Economies of scale:  per-user cost drops with 
increased volume
• Cell phones, PDAs, PCs
• Efficiencies from multiplexing
• S-curve:  growth of new service has S-shaped 
curve, challenge is to reach the critical mass

Regulation & Competition
• Telegraph & Telephone originally monopolies
• Extremely high cost of infrastructure
• Profitable, predictable, slow to innovate
• Competition feasible with technology 
advances
• Long distance cost plummeted with optical tech
• Alternative local access through cable, wireless
• Radio spectrum:  auctioned vs. unlicensed
• Internet supports multiple applications
• Innovation leads to new appls and usage models
• Regulation needed to ensure competition and 
universal access
Standards
• New technologies very costly and risky
• Standards allow players to share risk 
and benefits of a new market
• Reduced cost of entry
• Interoperability and network effect
• Compete on innovation
• Completing the value chain
• Chips, systems, equipment vendors, service 
providers
• Example:
• 802.11 LAN, IP, HTTP/SMTP/…
Standards Bodies
• Internet Engineering Task Force
• Internet standards development
• Request for Comments (RFCs):  www.ietf.org
• International Telecommunications Union
• International telecom standards
• IEEE 802 Committee
• Local area and metropolitan area network standards
• Industry Organizations
• MPLS Forum, WiFi Alliance, World Wide Web

Today’s Lecture
• Administrivia
• Why are networks important?
• What is a network?
• What is the Internet
• Internet design
• A whirlwind tour of the course
49
Page 13
Whirlwind Tour of the Course
• Infrastructure: hardware (or close to it)
• Core networking protocols: IP, dealing with 
errors and congestion, routing, …
• Optimizing performance: QoS techniques, 
caching, CDNs, peer-peer, …
• Making it work well: security, management, …
• IP everywhere: the Internet, last mile, wireless, 
mobility, data center, video, IP-TV, skype, …
• Focus is on today’s Internet but also trends
• What will the Internet look like in 10, 20, 30 years?
50
Infrastructure
• Why do we have different 
types of “wires”?
• And why do I care?
• Ethernet is very old, so why 
is it so fast?
• Can’t they find something 
better?
• What are the limits of some 
of the technologies?
• Both physical and protocol 
limits
51
Core Networking Protocols
Think: traffic on the roads
• How do I found a path to my destination
• How do I specify addresses
• What if my car breaks down?
• How do I deal with traffic jams
• …
52
Optimizing Performance
• Intuitively: lots of bandwidth!
• But there is more to it:
• Latency is often more critical!
• How voice and video – can I offer guarantees?
• Can I beat the speed of light?
• Hint: this can make you rich
• Why did we use peer to peer networks?
• And why did they (mostly) go away?
53
Page 14
Making the Network Work Well
• Good technology is only a small part of the puzzle 
– deployment and management issues are 
equally (or more) critical
• Involves many people, high cost
• How do I secure my network?
• Lots of bad guys: DOS, compromised hosts, privacy 
leaks, botnets, …
• How I manage resources, reduce operator errors, 
deal with failures, …
• And how does it differ in LAN, WAN, wireless, …
54
IP Everywhere
• Using IP technology has become attractive
• Cheap commodity hardware, lots of tools, people trained in the 
technology, end-to-end support, …
• The (public) Internet: our focus
• How do you optimize “the web”: CDNs, caching, …
• Data centers: very special requirements
• Map-reduce, 3-tier business apps, load balancing, …
• IP TV, voice/video conferencing: 
• Very high QoE expectations
• Wireless and mobile apps
• For many users, primary way of accessing Internet
• Residential networking
