Sector developments 
The telecommunications service industry is growing very rapidly, wiith average annual growth rates of 
10% during the last five years. These growth rates should continue for the next five years. This increase 
of activity is a result of the interaction of technological improvements (micro-electronics, optical fibres) 
and institutional changes (liberalisation). Technological advances in micro-electronics and the 
development of optical fibre cables have dramatically increased the processing capacity of 
telecommunications networks. The Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) is becoming an interconnected 
information processing system and the basic building stone of the information society. It has become 
evident that only widespread liberalisation (i.e. privatisation and opening up to competition) would carry 
the right incentives for modernisation of what used to be profitable but sleepy state monopolies. 
The number of lines in the EU fixed telecommunications network reached some 180 million by end 1995, 
or 48 lines per 100 inhabitants. In addition, there were 19 million mobile telephone subscribers. 
Teledensity, the sum of fixed and mobile lines, has therefore reached 53 access paths per 100 
inhabitants. Even though universal service seems to be achieved, i.e. neariy every household is 
equipped with a telephone, there are still large differences across EU-countries in terms of penetration 
and modernisation of the networks. In any case, the main source of growth in the future will not come 
from an increased subscriber base, but from increased services that will be feasible on a modernised 
network. 
In 1995 the telecommunications service market amounted to ECU 143 billion, of which ECU 17 billion 
(12% of the total) came from the mobile sector. The latter is expected to exhibit very high growth i.e. 
some 15 to 20% per year, over the next 5 years, and could represent up to 25% of the total revenue by 
the year 2000. 
Investments 
The expansion and modernisation of the fixed network has required huge investments, which have 
peaked during the years 1990-1994. In 1995, operators in the EU-countries invested ECU 31 billion, or 
some 25% of their turnover. For the years 1996-2000, some ECU 87bn will be invested by télécoms 
operators to complete the expansion and modernisation of the fixed network in the EU. 
The mobile telephone sector alone is expected to invest about 31 bn ECU for the years 1996-2000. This 
would bring the penetration rate of mobile telephones in the EU from 5.6% in 1995 to 17.2% in 2000. In 
some countries, investment in the mobile sector would be equivalent to, and may even exceed, the 
investment made for the fixed network. Moreover, as more and more players enter this industry and this 
sector converges with other sectors (e.g. computer, broadcasting, consumer electronics), the traditional 
public operators' investments will represent a declining fraction of the total investment requirements of 
the sector. The investment of these players is more dispersed and difficult to assess for the time being, 
but it is likely to be large. 
Tariffs and regulations 
Huge price decreases for telecommunications services have been observed as a result of technological 
advances and liberalisation. This has also affected the tariff setting, which used to be based on cross-
subsidisation. Local calls and monthly rentals were cheap compared to the cost of providing these 
services. Long distance and international calls provided the subsidies for local calls and line rentals. This 
distorted pricing system, where tariffs did not reflect costs, turned out to be inefficient and not sustainable 
in a competitive environment. Liberalisation would attract competition in long distance and international 
calls, driving down prices. To compensate for this, prices for local calls and rentals have to increase. 
Liberalisation therefore means "re-balancing" of tariffs, i.e. bringing them closer to cost. The practice 
has shown that even though local tariffs have increased, long distance and international tariffs have 
decreased by much more, so that in the end the adjustment led to widespread net benefits to the user. 
Cross-country comparison shows that cross-subsidisation is particulariy evident on long distance and 
intemational calls. Countries with higher tariffs on these segments include Austria, Italy, Portugal, Spain, 
Greece, Germany, Ireland and France. Operators in these countries will be more vulnerable to 
competition when the telecommunication markets start to be liberalised in 1998. Countries which have 
already opened up to competition (such as the UK and Sweden) are close to re-balancing their tariff 
structure and eliminating cross-subsidisation between different types of calls. "Non-competitive" 
countries still have to undertake considerable price cuts on long distance and international calls. 
Apart from the example of pioneering countries such as the UK and Sweden, the driving force behind 
liberalisation and dismantling of state monopolies has been the European Commission. The process is 
one of stages, but with accelerating speed. January 1998 is the deadline for complete liberalisation in 
most countries, including voice services. For mobile telecommunications, liberalisation already began in 
January 1996. 
Impact on operators 
The direct impact on the profits of incumbent operators as a result of liberalisation is strong, even though 
this may sometimes be overstated. Assuming a typical 70% gross margin on lost revenues, potential 
loss of profits would lie between 15 to 30% of present operating profits in static terms. The experience of 
liberalised markets, shows that a tough regulatory environment may have an effect on the performance 
of the incumbent operators that is similar to that of competition. Moreover, full infrastructure liberalisation 
will have a dramatic effect on investment cost and the prices of leased lines, and this will amplify the 
impact of services competition on the incumbent operators. Last, but not least, technology improvement 
in the form of digital transmission, fibre optics, micro-electronics and wireless telephony has lowered the 
barriers of entry and is probably the most important factor in challenging the incumbent operator's 
monopoly. 
To succeed in liberalised markets, public operators have to increase labour productivity. Most European 
operators now have labour productivity targets of 350 lines per employee for telephony services, against 
current levels of 200 to 250. Because an increase in the number of lines will be limited, this requires in 
many cases extensive shedding of staff with public operators, which presents a problem in most 
countries. Experience, however, shows that employment generated by the telecommunications sector 
through new services, more than outweighs the staff reduction by the public operator.

Telecommunications Network Development and Investment in the European 
Union 
1. Introduction 
The Bank has significantly financed the telecommunications sector in the EU. Financing 
amounted to some 2bn ECU per year over the period 1990-95, or about 5% of the yeariy 35bn ECU 
telecommunications investment in the Union. Up to now, the financing was mainly devoted to 
investment programmes by the monopoly operator with good security, occasionally guaranteed by the 
public sector. However, as a result of technological changes, widespread liberalisation and the 
emergence of new competitors, the sector is undergoing profound changes which will also affect Bank 
lending. There will certainly be increased opportunities for lending, but there will also be more risk. 
From an eligibility point of view, the Bank's financing of projects in the telecommunications 
sector are justified by their contribution in improving communication links within and outside Europe and 
in providing the basic infrastructure for an "information society". As a result, the international 
competitiveness of the European market would be improved. Support for new, private, initiatives in 
particular would strengthen the European-wide process of liberalisation and reduce the non-innovative 
role of established monopolies. This is at the very heart of the current EU policy of the sector. 
This sector review illustrates the main features of the market and how these are about to change. 
It also tries to highlight new financing opportunities that may arise as a result, as well as the increased 
risks. 
2. The market 
The telecommunications service industry is growing very rapidly, with average annual growth 
rates of 10% during the last five years. In 1995 the telecommunications service market amounted to 
ECU 143 billion, of which ECU 17 billion (12% of the total) came from the mobile sector (Figure 1). 
These high growth rates for the industry should continue also for the next five years. In particular mobile 
communications is expected to exhibit growth rates in the order of 15 to 20% per year, over the next 5 
years, and could represent up to 25% of the total telecommunications service market by the year 2000.

This increased growth in the service market is a result of the interaction of technological 
improvements (micro-electronics, optical fibres) and institutional changes (liberalisation). Technological 
advances in micro-electronics and the development of optical fibre cables have dramatically increased 
the processing capacity of telecommunications networks. The Plain Old Telephone System (POTS) is 
becoming an interconnected information processing system and the basic building stone of the 
information society. It has become evident that only widespread liberalisation (i.e. privatisation and 
opening up to competition) would carry the right incentives for modernisation of what used to be 
profitable but sleepy state monopolies. 
3. The telecommunications network in Europe 
3.1 The fixed network 
There are several measures of the size of the telecommunication networks. One is the number 
of lines per 100 inhabitants or the penetration rate. By 1995, there was an average of 48 mainlines per 
100 people in the EU. Even if this appears quite high, it is still some 10 points less than in the United 
States. However, there is a considerable heterogeneity across countries (Figure 2). Sweden and 
Denmark display outstanding telephone penetration rates of respectively 69 and 61 lines per 100 people. 
EU-countries with a much lower penetration rate are Ireland, Portugal and Greece. But these countries 
are catching up and recorded the highest growth in mainlines during the last years, along with Germany 
whose increase in the number in lines was induced by unification. In general, the EU is approaching the 
point where each household is equipped with a telephone. There is only one country, Ireland, with a 
connection rate of less than 80 per cent of households and therefore still room for high growth rates for 
subscribers. However, this full penetration of households needs not be an absolute limit, as there are 
countries such as Denmark, Greece, France, Luxembourg and Sweden where there are more residential 
phones than the number of households. 
Figure 2. Telephone penetration rates (lines per 100 inhabitants) in the EU in 1995

3.2. The mobile network 
Mobile communications is a new development and has big potential. Between 1989 and 1995 
the number of mobile telecommunications subscribers increased at a compound annual growth rate of 
42% meaning that by end 1995, there were already more than 19 million mobile subscribers in the EU. 
As figure 3 shows, the Nordic countries lead the way in terms of mobile penetration, with Sweden 
(22.9%), Finland (20.4%), and, to a lesser extent, Denmark (11.6%) having more than several times the 
EU average (5.2). In 1995 more mobile subscribers were added (6.6 million) than fixed mainlines (4 
million). In general, one can observe that in most EU-countries, with high fixed network penetration rates 
and efficient mobile telecommunication provision more mobile customers are added than fixed line 
customers. 
Figure 3. Mobile telephones per 100 inhabitants in the EU in 1995 
Source: ITU 
3.3. Overall assessment and international comparison 
Telecommunication access paths per 100 inhabitants (i.e. the sum of fixed and mobile phone 
lines) is a more accurate guide to the ability to access the network. This indicator suggests that the 
average tele-density in the EU-countries was more than one line for every two people in 1995. A 
comparison with the US situation shows that the EU is still lagging far behind the north Americans, with a 
telecom access path ratio in 1995 some 15 points below, due to less mainlines per 100 people (48 
against 58%) and less mobile connections (5.2 against 9.8%). To the extent that the US shows the way 
for future development in the EU télécoms sector, one could thus assume that a significant growth 
potential exists, in terms of the number of customers, both on the fixed and the mobile segments. 
3.4. Digitisation 
The full benefits of the innovations in the communication and information technologies will only 
accrue if all ways to send, receive and manage information are feasible with a single telecommunication 
infrastructure. The key condition for these developments, as far as public operators are concerned, is 
the digitisation of the network. In 1995, basically three fourths of the EU network was digitised. Since 
the late 1980's a number of EU-countries have boosted their rate of digitisation. In 1995 the EU 
(weighted) average ratio of digital mainlines was 74 per cent, against 32 per cent in 1989. However, 
there is quite a large heterogeneity in digitisation across countries (Figure 4). France and the 
Netheriands have been the initial pace setters with digitisation, with the United Kingdom and Sweden 
closely behind. These countries have already reached full digitisation, or will have done so within next 
year. All other countries are expected to have a fully digitised network within the year 2000, or shortly 
afterwards. 
- 6 
Figure 4. Digitisation rates (% of total lines) of the fixed network in the EU in 1995 
Digital technology is spreading as well in mobile telecommunications since its introduction in 
1992, accelerating the diffusion of mobile phones. The growth observed on the cellular market is now 
fully driven by digital technology, and it is expected that this technology will get neariy 70% of the market 
by 1997, as against 45% in 1995 (see figure 5). The spread of mobile telecommunications was grossly 
underestimated in the past. Digital technology has dramatically increased the potential of available 
value added services such as data transmission. Digital technology is, from this point of view, superior 
to the analogue technology. This explains the accelerated development of the mobile sector over the last 
three years, which is likely to continue for the next few years. 
Figure 5. Mobile telecommunication network (analogue and digital) development in the EU 
3.5. Optical fibre technology 
Transmission technologies in telecommunications are evolving at a very rapid rate. There is a 
strong synergy between digital switching and digital transmission. Optical fibre cable, which is ideally 
suited to digital transmission is now the dominant technology for inter-exchange connections. The 
penetration of optical fibres in telecommunication cable has been gradual. It began on the trunk inter-
exchange network. In several countries, these lines are now completely dominated by optical fibres. 
Optical fibre is now beginning to penetrate the local area network particulariy on the primary distribution 
cables (from the exchange to the primary distribution cabinets). It is expected that, in the future, optical 
fibre will also enter the secondary distribution channels (from the primary distribution cabinets to the 
subscribers). As penetration of optical fibres goes down the different layers of the network, demand for 
optical fibres expressed in fibre-km terms increases exponentially. However as local area costs are 
largely dominated by the costs of civil works (trenching), the replacement of existing copper cables by 
optical fibres will only take place when it is economically justified by, for example, the development of a 
new business area or the upgrading of a cable TV system. 
4. Investment trends and outlook 1996-2000 
Public telecommunications operators in the EU-countries invested an estimated ECU 31 billion in 
1995. This roughly corresponds, in real terms, to the level observed between 1983 and 1988, but below 
the average level 1989-1993 (see annex table 1). One reason for the investment peak observed in 
1989-1993 is the very large spending in Germany. After reunification, the country started to expand and 
upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure in Eastern Germany. 
Another reason for this period of booming investment is the large expenditure for additional 
modern (digital) mainlines. About 85 million digital mainlines were added by the 15 EU-countries from 
1990 to 1995. Some of these lines were for new customers, but most were upgrading the lines of existing 
customers. The EU-countries upgraded the lines of 53 million existing customers between 1990 and 
1995, while some 32 million new customers were connected to the network: for every new customer 
there were 1.7 digital upgrades for the lines of existing customers. This trend of increasing digitisation 
accelerated over the period, with a ratio of 1.2 to 1 over 1990-1992 and of 2.3 to 1 over 1993-1995. This 
means that investment is increasingly geared towards modernisation rather than expansion. 
The costs associated with installing a fixed telecommunications network are dominated by the 
requirement to bury cable in the ground. As a result, the cost for a new digital line is lower when an 
existing (analogue) line is replaced compared to adding a new connection which involves additional local 
area network costs. This fact is illustrated by figure 6, which shows the cost for a new digital line against 
the proportion of replacement in total new lines: there is a trend of the cost to be lower the higher the 
proportion of replacement of analogue lines. However, some countries exhibit a bias toward higher or 
lower than expected unit cost per line: Germany and Austria are considerably above average, whereas 
the United Kingdom is considerably below average. This may well reflect the role that competition 
between operators and suppliers has played in stimulating cost effectiveness.

It should be noted that any resource which allows a company to reduce this investment cost (for 
example, existence of easily accessible rights of way, ducts, poles or overhead electricity cables which 
may make the installation of fibre easier and much less costly) is of strategic relevance when it comes to 
becoming a new competitor in the market. For this reason utility companies, such as electricity, gas, 
railways and water, are already involved in the preparation of providing alternative local loop 
infrastructures. 
Total investment in telecommunications is increasingly difficult to measure. As the number of 
players rises along with the erosion of public monopoly position in most countries, the well documented 
public telecommunications investments represent a declining share of overall investment in 
telecommunications. Examples of additional investments, include investment in mobile communication, 
or investment by users in equipment such as facsimile or private branch exchange. This trend is 
particulariy pronounced in countries where télécoms markets have been fully or partially liberalised such 
as the United Kingdom, the Netheriands and the Nordic countries. In the United States, where the 
situation is similar, OECD estimated that investment in public telecommunications in 1992 by local and 
long distance carriers represented only 60 per cent of overall investment in the telecommunications 
sector. 
4.1. Fixed network 
In preparation for the 1998 "big bang", the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector, more 
rapid digitisation is now expected in most EU-countries, even those with a lower penetration rate where 
expansion of the network was, until recently, the dominant factor. It is likely that by the year 2000 the 
universal service obligation, i.e. each household is in principle equipped with a telephone, is satisfied. 
Moreover, most of the countries will also have achieved full digitisation by then. The investment 
requirements for full digitisation and universal service is estimated at some 85bn ECU until the year 
2000, of which 69bn for digitalisation and 16bn for new lines'·. For the expenditure in the individual 
countries see annex table 2. 
4.2. Mobile network 
Mobile telecommunications have seen a very rapid development in the EU during the last five 
years. There has been a mix of technological, regulatory and economic factors that have mutually 
reinforced the diffusion path for mobile telecommunications. In the past, the penetration rate for mobile 
The underlying assumption is thiat by ttie year 2000 all existing lines should be digitised. Moreover, universal sen/ice entails that 
each household should tie supplied with a fixed telephone line. For the cost estimate, an average cost of 3000 ECU Is taken for 
the cost of a new line and 1500 ECU for digitisation of an existing line. 
telephones has generally been underestimated. As a result of the rapid growth seen over the past two 
years, simple extrapolations may however induce overestimation of the potential for mobile 
communications. One can try to model penetration rates with a logistic diffusion function (the "S" curve). 
In this case the adoption of a mobile phone by the different agents is modelled in a similar way as 
diseases spread in biology. In other words, the flow of the adopters is related to the stock of existing 
adopters. At the beginning there is an acceleration in the adoption rate and then a decline once the 
population approaches saturation point. 
The penetration rates according to a logistic function for the different EU countries have thus 
been estimated (see annex table 3). One can notice that there is quite a different starting point between 
countries. There will also be differences in the year 2000. Total penetration rate in the EU is expected to 
increase from 5.6% in 1995 to 17.2% in 2000. This would imply that there are some 44 m new 
subscribers to mobile telecommunications. Assuming an average investment cost of 700 ECU per 
subscriber, the cumulative investment cost is 31 bn ECU by the year 2000. 
In a number of countries, investment in the mobile sector would thus be of neariy the same 
magnitude as the investments for the fixed network. In the case of the UK investment in mobiles could 
be even higher than for fixed telecommunications. 
The results should be interpreted with much caution, given the huge degree of uncertainty which 
surrounds the projections by country of the cellular market, as well as the rough methodology used to 
estimate the investment cost. In particular for certain small countries (Luxembourg, Greece) the figures 
projecting investment in the cellular market are likely to be overestimated. However, on a EU global 
level, these projections seem plausible. They show that the mobile sector has a major investment 
potential in the near future, not to mention the longer term. 
5. Tariffs 
The market for telecommunications services used to have a highly distorted price system, i.e. 
tariffs did not reflect the underiying cost of services provided. Typical international and long distance call 
prices were significantly above cost and local tariffs and rental charges below cost; in other words, the 
former were cross-subsidising the latter. This system was typically regulated by the government with the 
aim of ensuring universal service. This was politically appealing because it shifted the financial burden 
mainly to customers with high willingness to pay (i.e. companies and wealthy persons). However, from an 
economic point of view, it was inefficient. It became clear that this scenario could not withstand a 
competitive environment: the competitors would enter the high price/profit services market and push 
down the prices, therefore local tariffs and rental charges would have to increase to cover costs as the 
scope for cross-subsidisation would be reduced. A so called tariff re-balancing would therefore set in. 
This section outlines the evolution of tariffs in the EU and outlines expected effects of competition. 
5.1 Fixed network tariffs 
With the progressive liberalisation of the telecommunications market in the European Union, the 
analysis of tariff structures and levels is increasingly important in assessing the competitiveness of 
operators. Inter-country comparisons, which are a key element of such an analysis, are thus undertaken 
by referring to a basket of services. This is to avoid conditions specific to one country as much as 
possible. These baskets can determine whether a country's operator is expensive or inexpensive, and to 
what extent the introduction of competition is likely to lead to an erosion of its market shares. 
For business users, the Northern European countries, including Denmark, Finland, the 
Netheriands and Sweden, continue to offer the lowest prices by far, as annex table 4 shows. These 
countries have recently significantly liberalised their telecommunications market, while on the other hand 
the most expensive countries for business users, such as Austria, Greece, Italy, Spain, Germany, Ireland 
and Portugal, have retained monopoly provision of most of the télécoms services: the average annual 
spending by a business user in Austria is some three times the amount paid in Sweden or in the 
Netheriands. The tariff basket for residential users reflects a similar ranking of the EU-countries to the 
business basket. 
10 
The tariff baskets for residential and business users are highly correlated and depend to a large 
extent on the prevailing market structure. The importance of market structure becomes even stronger 
when it comes to international tariff comparisons. Countries which have allowed competition in the sector 
are the least expensive countries for an international basket based on a fixed distribution of calls among 
adjacent countries and other EU-countries, the USA and Asia. While the OECD generally undertakes 
tariff comparisons in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP), we have used current exchange rates, 
which provide more accurate information on the cost to the consumer and is also the reference for 
competitors such as call-back operators. These call-back services were pioneered in the United States 
where suppliers took advantage of competitive rates to offer US prices to overseas customers abroad 
where local carriers charge much higher prices. 
The trend toward lower international tariffs has thus been further stimulated by call-back 
operators. For a business traveller or tourist, the exchange rate with their home country is thus a more 
relevant measure of the cost of an international call than the purchasing power parity of the local 
currency. Countries like Austria, Italy, Portugal and Spain, with expensive international tariff baskets, 
appear to be very vulnerable to competition from call-back services. Also, countries with relatively strong 
currencies such as Germany, the Netheriands and France, appear similariy attractive for call-back 
customers. On the other hand, countries with relatively inexpensive charges or in some cases weaker 
currencies, such as Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Sweden and the UK, would seem to be attractive hubbing 
sites for call-back operators. 
5.2. Mobile network tariffs 
Mobile telecommunication is one of the most dynamic areas of the telecommunications sector 
and this is amplified by the reduction in prices over the last few years. The cost of handsets has fallen 
dramatically as a result of technological advances, economies of scale and of very vigorous competition 
among manufacturers. At the same time, the average cost of joining a mobile network (connection and 
rental) in the EU area has fallen by more than 30 per cent since 1992. In 1996 almost all EU-countries 
had competitive provision of mobile telecommunications, generally two service providers including the 
incumbent public operator. Nevertheless, there is still a large disparity of tariffs across countries. Nordic 
countries such as Sweden, Finland and Denmark have typically much lower tariffs than the other. 
Lower prices are themselves making mobile services affordable for a greater number of users. 
At the same time, there is a trend toward the convergence of fixed and mobile network capabilities in the 
form of cordless and cellular telecommunication. The gap between a basket of fixed and mobile services 
is narrowing especially in those countries where mobile telecommunications is subject to more 
competition and is therefore developing fast. 
5.3. Leased lines 
Leased lines allow large users (e.g. business) to take advantage of volume discounts and to 
have control over their own telecommunication facilities and traffic. At the same time, leased lines 
provide a platform for competitors to incumbent public operators to offer a range of value added services 
and complement their own networks. As indicated in annex table 5, the OECD basket of leased line 
charges shows huge discrepancies among EU countries over different speeds and distances. However, 
correct comparisons of similar services in regard to leased lines is difficult, mainly because the sources 
generally fail to specify whether the cost of the end links (sometimes called telecommunication tails) to 
customer premises are included. In addition, some packages include redundancy in the form of a 
second line at a lower price or priority service restoration in the event of a network fault as customer 
options. 
5.4. Tariff trends and rebalancing in the EU 
After the EU-countries decided in the eariy 1990's that télécoms markets should be liberalised in 
most member states by 1998, a number of remarkable price trends have followed. For instance, the 
average total cost of a basket of telecommunication services either for a business or a residential user 
has declined rapidly. Between 1993 and 1995, the average cost in the EU of a basket of 
telecommunication services for a business user has declined in real terms from ECU 1 179 to ECU 878, 
and for a residential user from ECU 378 to ECU 275. Expressed in per cent, the actual decreases were 
respectively 25.5% and 27.3%. For international calls the reduction was even higher, i.e. 30%. 
-11 
However, these gains for the users were not evenly spread throughout the EU. Hereafter we 
differentiate countries according to the status competition, and we distinguish a group of "competitive" 
countries with effective competition among operators (i.e. Denmark, Finland, the Netheriands, Sweden 
and the United Kingdom) and another group of "non-competitive" countries (i.e. the remaining countries 
of the EU) where competition among operators is weak or non existent. Several key trends emerge: 
• The cost of average baskets decreased in competitive countries by an amount equivalent or greater 
than the decrease observed in non-competitive markets. This trend affects both the business and 
residential baskets, in contrast to eariier fears that residential customers could be penalised by the 
liberalisation of the sector. Moreover, the average tariff level of the baskets in competitive countries 
remains much lower than in non-competitive countries. This indicates that further drastic price cuts 
are likely to occur in non-competitive countries. 
• Re-balancing between usage charges and fixed charges is occurring at a much faster rate in 
competitive countries. In other words, these countries have been lowering the contribution of usage 
charges relative to fixed charges such as rental and connection fees. 
• While fixed charges are higher on average in competitive countries, usage charges are much lower 
and are reduced at a faster rate than in non-competitive countries. This suggests that non-
competitive countries are very far from having significantly re-balanced their tariff structures. 
• Concerning the pricing of geographical distance in calls, one can observe that public operators in 
competitive markets have reduced tariffs at a relatively faster rate than in non-competitive markets, 
and implementing the greatest reductions (in relative terms) over shorter distances (see figure 7). As 
a result, the proportion between local and long distance rates is in the order of 1 to 3 in competitive 
countries, while it is of 1 to around 10 in non-competitive countries: this gives an idea of the order of 
magnitude for the future price cuts, especially on long distance calls, that one may expect after 
liberalisation in 1998.

6. Regulatory framework 
In most Western European countries, telecommunications services used to be provided by a 
single organisation, on a regulated monopoly basis, at least until the late 1980's. In almost every case, 
the organisations were departments of the public sector administration, providing postal services as well 
as telecommunications services, where the latter cross-subsidised the former. The argument for 
monopoly provision of telecommunication services was mainly that of economies of scale due to the high 
set-up costs of networks, avoidance of duplication of networks, together with the social obligation to 
provide universal service at the same price throughout the country. 
12 
However, over the last 15 years, advances in technology, which have reduced the cost and 
increased the functionality of telecom networks and services, and the realisation through experience of 
liberalised mari^ets that monopoly provision could be an inefficient way to serve users, have called into 
question the relevance of the prevailing regulatory regime. The experience made with liberalisation of 
telecommunications in a few countries (such as the US, the UK and Sweden) has demonstrated that 
competition is feasible and could produce a demand-led and market-driven telecommunications sector. 
At the same time this would also lead to more innovation in services, a broadening customer choice, an 
increase in investment and a reduction of costs and prices. These potential benefits led individual 
governments and the European Commission to initiate wide-ranging reform programmes with the 
objective of ending the monopoly provision of telecommunications services. 
6.1. Community regulations for liberalisation 
The main direction of EU telecommunications policy was set in 1987 with the publication of the 
Green Paper on the development of the common market for telecommunications services and 
equipment. The Commission proposed the introduction of more competition combined with a higher 
degree of harmonisation, in orderte maximise the opportunities offered by the single EU market. 
On the basis of the favourable reaction from all market participants to the Green Paper, the 
Commission prepared an action programme supported by the Council and the other European 
Institutions. This programme included : 
• Rapid full opening of the technical equipment market to competition; 
• Full mutual recognition of type-approval for technical equipment; 
• Progressive opening of the telecommunications services market to competition; 
• Clear separation of regulatory and operational activities; 
• Establishment of open access conditions to networks and services through the Open Network 
Provision (ONP) programme; 
• Establishment of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), in order to stimulate 
European standardisation (which started in 1988); 
• Full application of the Community's competition rules to the telecommunications sector. 
These actions have subsequently been implemented to a large extent through the adoption of a 
series of legislative measures, among which are: 
• Open Network Provision Directive of 1990 (90/987): it harmonises the methods and conditions of 
public access to the network according to the principles of objectivity, transparency and non-
discrimination. 
• Services Directive of 1990 (90/388): it provides for the gradual removal of special and exclusive 
rights granted by Member states to telecommunication operators for supply of value added (by end 
1990) and data services (by 1.1.1993). 
• Public Voice Telephony and Infrastructure Directive of 1996 (96/19); calls on member states to 
liberalise the provision of public voice telephony services throughout the Union by 1 January 1998, 
while maintaining universal service. Additional transition periods of up to five years could be granted 
to Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal to allow for necessary adjustments, particulariy of tariffs, and 
a possible additional period of two years could apply to countries with very small networks (e.g. 
Luxembourg), if justified. In view of these deadlines, restrictions on the use of alternative 
infrastructure should be lifted by 1996 and licensing and interconnection rules should be set down by 
1997. 
• Mobile Communications Directive of 1996 (96/2); it abolishes the special and exclusive rights in 
mobile communications, which was previously excluded from the Services Directive. It also aims at 
an eariy liberalisation (by 1997) of infrastructures and the right for mobile operators to directly 
interconnect. It also explicitly requests Member States not to refuse licences for the operation of 
alternative DCS 1800 mobile systems. 
6.2. Implications for tariffs and universal service 
The opening up of telecommunications service markets to competition, as well as the regulatory 
requirements on pricing and the availability of new technologies, requires European operators to 
undertake major tariff reviews to correct historical imbalances and allow development of new services. 
In the Communication on tariffs of 1992 (SEC (92) 1050), the Commission set out guidelines for 
cost orientation and adjustment of pricing structures. This builds on the principles set out in the Open 
Network Provision Directive, that tariffs should be cost-oriented and that national regulatory authorities 
should ensure that cost accounting systems are put in place by the operators to provide transparent 
13 
information. In orderte meet the 1998 liberalisation deadline, most Member States have already started 
to re-balance national tariffs, involving lower prices for international and long-distance calls and 
consequently higher charges for local calls and basic connections. This tariff re-balancing is as such 
closely linked to the issue of universal service. 
The Commission's Communication (COM (93) 543) establishes the key elements of the policy of 
providing universal service for telecommunication in the Union. This defines the scope of universal 
service (i.e. a basic voice telephony service and a network access supporting it, as well as fax and low 
speed data access), the methodology to be followed for costing universal service (i.e. a "net cost" 
approach), and the possible funding mechanisms to share any identifiable burden associated with the 
provision of universal service (i.e. compensations may not be required for minimal burden; a national 
universal service fund may be established; a system of supplementary charges may be requested from 
market players by the incumbent operator). The document recognises that competition would improve 
service quality, bring down prices and extend penetration. However, at the same time affordability is 
essential to ensure that service will be genuinely universal. Flexible and targeted tariffs should play an 
important role, as concerns affordability for all users. 
7. Impact of competition on network operators 
In the rapidly changing technological and regulatory environment, many opportunities are arising 
for new and existing companies as well as many threats to existing companies and, for all operators, 
increased uncertainties and risks. The incumbent operators of fixed telephony networks and services, 
who until recently felt sure of their continued domination due to the "natural monopoly" in transmission 
and distribution, have to adapt to the changing environment and the emerging competition. 
The threat of competition has already started to induce a response in terms of improved quality, 
business customer focus, new products and efficiency programmes. The mere fact of simply becoming a 
"contestable" market, even before new competitors have actually started operations, induces the 
telecommunications sector to register huge efficiency gains and dramatic improvements for the 
customers in terms of service quality and range of products. 
The customary design of POTS public investments is challenged by the opening up of the 
sector. Competition vyill arise not only on the network, but also between communication networks. This is 
already happening at a large scale in certain countries, such as the UK where cable TV companies are 
also offering telephone services. A further challenge is mobile communications, whose potential still has 
to be fully exploited. 
7.1. Fixed network operators 
The incumbent operators are facing a situation where significant tariff reductions on the most 
profitable segments, international and long-distance, have to accompany increased investments for 
modernisation and/or upgrading of their networks. At the same time, experience of competition in more 
advanced countries has shown that an erosion of market shares is unavoidable at least in specific 
segments. As a result, most European télécoms incumbent operators will sooner or later face a decline in 
profitability, depending on the time scales of market share losses which may, in some cases, take more 
than a couple of years. Efficiency gains and overall market growth may also be able to offset part of the 
loss of revenues, but this is likely to be insufficient. 
As an example, a simplified model of telecommunications investment shows that under 
optimistic assumptions (the investment cost per line is ECU 1000 - 1500, operational costs are 15% of 
the investment cost, and a payback period of 15 years), break-even at a 10% discount rate would require 
an average revenue per line of some ECU 400 to 600 in real terms over a 15-year period. This can be 
compared with the actual range of values of the average revenue per line in the EU : from some ECU 
400, in the most liberalised countries, to neariy ECU 1000, the other extreme which could thus be 
expected to reach the lower figure some years after liberalisation. 
Against this background it is clear that, unless radical efficiency gains and growth of value added 
services are achieved, public companies could face financial problems. They therefore have to adopt 
consistent investment strategies along with new managerial and commercial practices, while they need 
to accelerate their tariff re-balancing to minimise the impact of competition. 
14 
Liberalisation cannot be considered alone. All operators face challenges in their home markets 
from a combination of liberalisation, regulation and technology. In liberalised countries, regulators control 
prices to protect customers from undue price increases. The experience from the UK and Swedish 
markets shows that a tough regulatory environment for prices had a similar impact on the performance of 
the incumbent operators than competition, even at a relatively late stage of competitive entry. Price 
caps2, now in place in almost all EU countries thus constitute an important signal of the speed at which 
the operators are forced to re-balance their tariffs: this is low in already liberalised countries, where costs 
are close to tariffs, with a CPI minus 0 to 3% per year up to 1998 in Netheriands, Sweden and Denmark, 
but as high as CPI minus 5 to 8% in France, Gemriany, Italy or Spain. 
While price caps are determined domestically, price comparisons with other European countries 
are becoming an increasingly important factor for service providers. It is worth here insisting again on the 
difference between competition on the network and competition between networks. With competition on 
the network the new entrants have to lease transmission capacity from the incumbent. With competition 
between networi^s, new entrants may choose either to use existing alternative networks, those owned by 
utilities or cable television companies, or completely new infrastructure construction. In the first case, it is 
obvious that high rental charges for leased lines will limit the effectiveness of competition in services. 
It was shown eariier in the less liberalised countries (in particular Austria, Italy, Germany, France 
and Spain) that the average tariff for a leased line from the incumbent is some 2 to 3 times higher than in 
the liberalised countries of the EU, and neariy 10 times the corresponding US tariff. Full infrastructure 
liberalisation, as expected by the Commission, would have a dramatic effect not only on the prices of 
leased lines, but more importantly would eventually amplify the impact of service competition on the 
incumbent operators. 
Last but not least, technology in the form of digital transmission, fibre optics, micro-electronics 
and wireless telephony, is probably the most effective factor undermining the position of the incumbent 
monopoly operator. It makes it not only cheaper for new competitors to enter the market, it also reduces 
the profit margin in liberalised markets. Something similar has happened in the computer industry, where 
large companies like IBM and Digital Equipment were forced into restructuring as prices fell faster than 
overheads. To the extent that telecom switches are now simply large computers, they are subject to the 
same price decline, with eventually similar effects on the télécoms sector. 
To succeed in liberalised markets, operators have started to adopt strategies aiming at 
increasing productivity, while expanding domestically and abroad in fast growing segments. Actually, the 
economic significance of the télécoms industry is increasing rapidly all over the worid: the evidence from 
already liberalised countries is that the industry is losing its narrow product characteristics of a utility and 
is becoming a mixed market of consumer and business products open to branding, variety and choice. 
Stimulated by tariff decreases and opening of the economies, long distance and international traffic in 
liberalised markets are growing at rates ranging from 10% to 12% per annum. Direct spending on 
telecommunications has increased from some 2% to more than 3% of GDP. As well as stimulating a 
wider range of new products and services, competition acts as a very strong incentive to improve service 
quality. Efficiency improvement is however key in this process, and this requires drastic manpower 
reductions: most European operators are now implementing labour productivity targets of 350 lines per 
employee for telephony services, against the current levels of 150 to 250. The important conclusion to 
draw is that all European operators have room for considerable efficiency gains, implementing the 
benefit of technology and lower equipment costs. 
The responses available to the incumbent operators to the threat of competition are a mix of the 
basic strategies: 
(i) to become a global service provider, focusing primarily on large and multinational customers to 
protect the domestic market and grow abroad (e.g. BT); 
(ii) to expand in multimedia, focusing primarily on residential customers, with a view to developing in 
cable television and new interactive services (Deutsche Telekom and Teledanmark have particular 
opportunities given their cable-TV ownership); 
(iii) to become a developing country operator, taking stakes in Eastern Europe (Telia, Teledanmark, 
Deutsche Telekom) or Latin America (Telefonica, France Telecom); 
Price caps formula imposed a celling on the evolution of a télécoms teriff basket, by reference to the Consumer Price Index 
(CPI), reduced by an efficiency factor of X%, i.e. "CPI minus X%". 
15 
(iv) to establish mobile businesses domestically and abroad, building up a portfolio of stakes in 
developed and developing countries. 
All these strategies are expensive, putting pressure on the strong cash-flow generation of 
existing operators' businesses, not only in the short term but also in the medium term: BT and the 
Scandinavian télécoms operators are already sustaining start-up losses abroad on an upward trend. 
These strategies have also resulted in a web of international cross-holdings and alliances. The forces 
driving companies towards partnerships are the perception that no operator has all the skills in-house to 
tackle the new market-place; that it is now a necessity to operate on a pan-European level and that risks 
are better mitigated through diversification. 
7.2. Mobile network operators 
The table below summarises the main competitive features for mobile communications in the EU 
countries. This shows quite a heterogeneous picture. The number of operators can vary from 1 to 4. 
However, there is a trend for all countries to increase the number of different operators as the benefits of 
competition are very clear. The dominant operator is normally the incumbent fixed network operator, as 
this is generally also the first to have entered the mobile phone market.

Infrastructure costs, which used to constitute the higher percentage of total costs for mobile 
communication costs, are becoming proportionally much less with the introduction of large up-front 
licence payments. Operators are also under regulatory pressure to build out rapidly after the high up-front 
investment of infrastructure purchases. At the same time mobile switches are becoming more 'intelligent' 
and modular in design and, as a result, contribute to reducing long-term replacement costs, since 
switches can be upgraded rather than changed out, thus keeping costs to the minimum. Such changes 
have radically transformed network economics in the mobile industry to the extent that national networks 
are being built in months rather than decades, offering a level of expansion and interconnection of 
networks never met before, with phenomenal social and economic implications. 
The risks of mobile operations depend on the prospect for future growth of the market, and the 
ability of the company to maintain its projected share. Market growth has, up to now, been systematically 
underestimated. But one should bear in mind that penetration rates have not reached a level supposed to 
correspond to a "mass market" size in most countries. This is estimated to be in the order of 10-12%, 
which corresponds to the 'professional' share of the market. Only in a few countries, notably Sweden, 
Finland and Denmark, are those rates now significantly above this level. In other words, while the speed 
at which the market develops may be underestimated, it remains to be seen whether conditions are met 
in a specific country for the penetration rate to reach the mass market threshold. Given higher and higher 
up-front fees, this situation is associated with very significant risks for new mobile projects.
