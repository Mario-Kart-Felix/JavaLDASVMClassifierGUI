ABSTRACT 
 
 
e-learning, as defined to be the use of information and communications technology (ICT) 
for supporting the educational processes, has motivated Tanzania to apply ICT in its 
education system. Tanzania secondary schools in rural areas are geographically and 
socially isolated. Rural Tanzania secondary schools face a number of problems including 
ways in getting learning materials, as well as inadequacy in qualified teachers. The 
impact of these problems is poor performance in National Examinations. This poor 
performance however is highly noted in science and mathematics subjects. The problem 
in getting learning materials can be reduced by employing ICT in secondary school 
education system. 
  
This research develops an interactive e-learning management system (e-LMS) to be used 
by Tanzanian secondary schools. The research is aiming to support teaching and learning 
functions by allowing creation and storage of learning materials, making them available, 
easily accessed and sharable among students from different secondary schools in 
Tanzania in a more organized way. Tanzania has only one curriculum for all secondary 
schools registered under the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT). 
During development stage it will not be easy to involve all scattered Tanzanian secondary 
schools. The research is focusing to two selected pilot schools; Kibaha secondary school 
and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary in Kibaha town, Pwani region. Features of the e-LMS 
will represent the standard form of any other secondary school registered by the MoEVT. 
The complete implementation of the e-LMS to these selected pilot schools will later be 
extended to all other secondary schools in Tanzania.  
 
The development uses Object-Oriented System Analysis and Design (OOSAD) approach 
along with the power of modeling as it has been emphasized by Model Driven 
Architecture (MDA). Unified Modeling Language (UML) is mainly used in both cases. 
To create an interoperable system, UML is integrated with extensible markup language 
(XML) during model transformation from e-LMS Platform Independent Model (PIM) to 
e-LMS Platform Specific Model (PSM). Development will make use of open source 
software. For context specific development, participatory action research methodology is 
adopted and the inputs are well presented in developing e-LMS. Customization of open 
source learning management system (LMS) platforms is employed to help generate a 
timely solution to e-LMS development. Finally, this thesis also considers the need for 
replication and mirroring of the database for the purpose of making learning materials 
highly available to end-users.

OVERVIEW OF ICT FOR e-LEARNING PROJECT  
 
 
There are many initiatives already undertaken to address the issues of ICT in Tanzania, 
one of them being Sida/SAREC, the department for Research Co-operation (SAREC), 
within the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA). Sida/SAREC has taken 
initiative to carry out regional collaboration ICT surveys covering three countries namely 
Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Looking at the magnitude of different activities that 
can be improved by the use of ICT even to rural areas, e-learning for secondary schools 
in Tanzania was given a high priority to the ongoing ICT research project under the 
above mentioned programme. 
 
The motivation of selecting e-learning for secondary schools project in Tanzania goes 
along with the National strategy of reducing poverty in the country. The strategy is 
named as “National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (NSGRP)”, 
commonly referred to by its Kiswahili acronym MKUKUTA – “Mpango wa Kukuza 
Uchumi na Kuondoa Umasikini Tanzania”.  Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC, 
2004) in its secondary education development plan (SEDP) final document pointed out 
that the Government formulated a poverty reduction strategy in year 2000. The strategy is 
underpinned by the notion that economic growth is a precondition for poverty reduction. 
In turn, this requires sound economic management, increased investment and 
improvements in productivity. Expansion of the educational system is at the center of the 
Government’s strategy to both increasing the rate of economic growth and productivity, 
as well as to ensure that the earnings are more equitably distributed. 
 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2001) 
argues that the role of education in poverty eradication is crucial. No country has 
succeeded if it has not educated its people. Education is not only important in reducing 
poverty, but it is also a key to wealth creation. Education gives power to people to 
become more proactive and gain control over their lives. The basic education is one of 
the keys to empowerment, both for individuals and groups. It is the primary vehicle by 
which economically and socially marginalized adults and children can lift themselves out 
of poverty and obtain the means to participate fully in their communities. Poverty is both 
a cause and an effect of insufficient access to or completion of quality education. One 
valuable quote for education and poverty presented by the late Julius Nyerere, the first 
President of the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) during the International Workshop 
on Education and Poverty Eradication Kampala, Uganda, 30 July to 3 August 2001 is 
(UNESCO, 2001): 
 
"Education is not a way to escape poverty - It is a way of fighting it."  
 
MoEC (2004) in its SEDP final report states that secondary education apart from being 
vital for sustainable economic take off in the country, has personal and great social 
benefits crucial for modernization and development of society as a whole. The overall 
goal of the plan of SEDP is to increase the proportion of Tanzania youths completing 
secondary education with acceptable learning outcome. The SEDP plan as well as the 
  2 
 
Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT) ICT Policy for basic education 
have some programme areas which are supported by the ICT for e-learning project as 
follows: 
• Improvement of access; the goal is to reach 50% cohort participation and 
transition rate from primary to secondary education by year 2010. One mentioned 
means to achieve this is by the expansion of open and distance learning. 
 
• Quality Improvement; the goal is to raise the pass rate of division I – III, from 
36% to 70% and eliminate failures. Some of the strategies mentioned include 
improvement of school libraries, reviewing the curriculum and enhance quality of 
examinations and assessment systems. 
 
• Education Management System Improvement; the goal is to optimize the use of 
available resources. One of the strategies to achieve this is to improve access to 
and use of Education Management Information System (EMIS). 
 
The MoEVT ICT Policy for basic education has the mission of integrating ICT to 
enhance access, equity, quality and relevance of basic education, while stimulating and 
improving teaching and life long learning (MoEVT, 2007). Along side, the strategy of 
poverty reduction by employing the use of ICT is being indicated by the Ministry of 
Communications and Transport (MoCT), National ICT Policy of Tanzania vision which 
state that (MoCT, 2003):  
 
“By exploiting its unique geographical position, Tanzania becomes a 
regional hub of ICT infrastructure providing ICT-based solutions that 
enhance sustainable socio-economic development, which addresses 
national and regional poverty reduction concerns” 
 
The ICT for e-learning project to a big extend supports strategies that has been pinpointed 
by the National ICT policy (MoCT, 2003) which emphasizes the use of ICT-based 
solutions and the concerned MoEVT ICT Policy which wants to integrate ICT in 
education. The e-learning project is interested in seeing that the pass rate of secondary 
schools’ students is increasing especially in mathematics and science subjects for the 
purpose of increasing the number of students who meet the entry qualification to join 
science subject’s related degrees. The overall main objective of the e-learning project is: 
 
“To improve the quality of science education in secondary school in 
the rural areas of Tanzania”  
 
Strategies of implementing this objective of the project are very much related to the plans 
as indicated by SEDP and MoEVT ICT Policy for basic education: 
• To establish most suitable and effective connectivity and configuration. This gives 
the opportunity of implementing distance learning as indicated by SEDP 
• To develop a context centered platform which includes e-learning content 
management system using open source software. This is related to the strategy to 
  3 
 
improve access to and use of Education Management Information System (EMIS) 
as mentioned by SEDP and MoEVT ICT policy 
• To develop local content materials for science and mathematics subjects for self 
learning environment as per approved National curriculum. This is related to two 
of the objectives of the MoEVT, (2007) ICT Policy for basic education namely; to 
facilitate the development and use of ICT as a pedagogical tool for teaching and 
learning, and to promote development of local content for basic education 
• To develop access control, authorization tools and applications to manage and 
secure the platform and the contents. This is related to one of the objectives of the 
MoEVT, (2007) ICT Policy for basic education namely; to facilitate the use of 
ICT as a tool for assessment and evaluation of education, as well as 
administration and management 
 
Internationally, Tanzania like any other country has to abide with the international 
strategies towards the use of ICT. The e-learning research project is supporting the 
statement delivered by Kobsak Chutikul on-behalf of Supachai Panitchpakdi, Secretary-
General of United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the 
World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS), ICT for All (ICT4All) in Tunis – 
Africa (Chutikul, 2006), hereby quoted that: 
 
“Information and communication technologies can make a potentially 
significant contribution to sustainable social and economic 
development”.  
 
The ICT for e-learning project insist that the key for social and economic sustainability 
can be easily implemented if people are well educated.

1.0 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 
 
 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have been integrated in education 
in many developing and developed countries alike, but the use of ICT in Tanzanian 
secondary schools is still lagging behind. Many Tanzanian secondary schools have no 
computers; however many show an effort of acquiring personal computers (PCs). The 
few schools with computers use them primarily for secretarial services and computer 
literacy training. Very few secondary schools have Internet services, and they are mainly 
accessible to the heads of the computer unit, headmasters of the schools and staff. Few 
schools have ICT infrastructure; that is, a Local Area Network (LAN). 
 
This research comes at a time when there are many initiatives already undertaken to 
address the ICT issues in Tanzania, however many of them are concentrated in big cities 
and towns especially in higher learning institutions. Sida/SAREC, the department for 
Research Co-operation (SAREC), within the Swedish International Development Agency 
(SIDA) has taken initiative to carry out countrywide ICT surveys that include: 
Information regarding key ratios, connectivity, access, the human resource situation, key 
institutions, policy and regulatory framework. The ICT surveys have been undertaken in 
Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Mozambique (Miller, 2001). In Tanzania this research is 
conducted at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Systems (ECSE), College of 
Engineering and Technology (CoET) of the University of Dar-es-Salaam (UDSM). I 
happen to be a staff member (Lecturer) of ECSE, CoET and now taking part as a PhD 
student within Sida/SAREC programme (Research proposal, 2001). 
 
Looking at the magnitude of different activities that can be improved by the use of ICT 
for rural areas, e-learning for secondary schools in Tanzania was given a high priority to 
the ongoing ICT research project under the above mentioned programme. It is envisaged 
that once network connectivity is established in secondary schools, the other services 
such as e-governance, e-health and e-business can be extended to the surrounding areas. 
(Research proposal, 2001). 
 
 
1.2 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
 
Tanzania secondary schools that are dominantly located in rural areas are geographically 
and socially isolated. These schools face a number of problems in ensuring quality 
delivery of learning materials. Such schools face three critical issues that are global in 
perspective, but remain focused on learners' needs. These are: shortage of teachers, 
quality of teaching and the capacity of schools in terms of incentives/motivations. 
Schools located in remote areas are a disincentive for excellent teachers compared to 
working in urban areas.  
 
  5 
 
The Government is working hard not only to raise quality of education but also to expand 
access. The Government efforts include programs to raise standards of teachers on part, 
provide additional funding for high level training up to degree level and in service 
training. Government efforts cannot have desired impact if even motivated teachers 
cannot have access to basic academic resource materials for themselves and their 
students.  
 
Together with the efforts which may be taken by the Tanzania Government towards 
improving education system, still the rate of increase of newly opened secondary school 
and students is high compared to the rate of increase of teachers, text books and learning 
references. 
 
National Data (2004) shows that the total number of secondary schools (Government and 
non-Government) is almost doubled between 1995 and 2004 as shown in table 1.1. That 
is from 595 schools in 1995 to 1,291 schools in 2004, an increase of 117%.  As a result, 
student’s enrolment has also increased by 120% from 196,375 students in year 1995 to 
432,599 students in year 2004.  But the total number of teachers has increased by only 
68% from 11,158 teachers in 1995 to 18,754 teachers in 2004. Due to this student 
increased rate, the teacher to students’ ratio has increased from 1:17 in 1995 to 1:23 in 
2004. Table 1.2 shows the Enrolment of Students and Teacher, and Teacher to Student 
ratio 1995 – 2004.

Number of secondary schools keeps on increasing year after year. In year 2006 the 
statistic shows that there were a total of 2,292 secondary schools, an increase of almost 
78% of 1,291 secondary schools in year 2004. 
 
Many schools lack basic information resources such as well-stocked school libraries. 
Textbooks and other reference materials are usually not available in libraries and if 
available they are outdated. Purchasing textbooks is considerably expensive. Another 
problem is in inadequacy of laboratory facilities especially for science subjects which 
lead to newly established schools follow arts curriculum. The result of this is a relatively 
decreased number of graduate science students and majority of them have poor 
performance. There are regional schools that do not attract better teachers because of 
their location, pay scale, competition from private industry, or sometimes because the 
teachers they need are not available. 
 
These problems cause inequality in performance levels between rural and urban schools 
as it is being analyzed in sub-item 1.2.2. The result of it is poor performance 
academically in rural secondary schools. The poor performance is more critical in science 
and mathematics subjects. Many students do not meet entry requirements for science and 
engineering courses at higher learning institutions.  
 
 
1.2.1 Definition of Rural Secondary School 
 
There is no single definition of rural area; however, many definitions tend to identify 
rural areas as having low population densities and unique economic and social 
conditions. When coming to rural schools, Sandra et al. (2007) and Sher (1983) state that 
rural schools have recognizable tendencies, such as: less specialization, less equipment 
and less bureaucracy than schools in non-rural sites. The distinction between rural and 
urban has been based on the availability and impact of science and technology. On the 
negative side, it is imagined that the rural schools offers the students a deficit education 
due to issues such as lack of science activities (Stine, 1997) and lack of consistent 
curriculum (Amaral et al., 2001). For the teachers, this deficit model of rural-ness 
includes geographical isolation (Amaral et al., 2001) 
  
As stated earlier, Tanzania rural secondary schools are generally those schools located in 
rural areas and they are geographically and socially isolated. But in reality, Tanzania as a 
developing country, many of its secondary schools both in urban, semi-urban and rural 
areas are subjected to basic problem mentioned in 1.2 above. Tanzania has many schools 
located in urban or semi-urban areas but equally facing the same problem as in rural area 
schools. In this case the definition of rural secondary school with respect to this research 
is hereby defined as: 
 
“Tanzania secondary school whether located in urban area (big cities), 
semi-urban area (regional and some few district cities) or real rural area 
with reference to geographical isolation, as long as it is lacking necessary 
resources such as books, qualified teachers, laboratories etc for the 
  7 
 
purpose of achieving good performance, the school will be referred to as a 
rural secondary school.” 
 
 
1.2.2 Student’s Performance Analysis 1995-2003 
 
Tanzania secondary education system which is the level just after primary school level, is 
divided into two main parts: One; Ordinary level (O-Level) secondary school which starts 
from form I to form IV. In form IV, students sit for National Examination famously 
known as Certificate of Secondary Education Examination (CSEE). Students from O-
level can be selected to join advanced level of secondary school or certificate courses 
depending on the student’s performance. Two; Advanced Level (A-Level) secondary 
school which starts from form V to form VI. In form VI, students sit for National 
Examination famously known as Advance Certificate of Secondary Education 
Examination (ACSEE). Students from A-level can be selected to join ordinary diploma 
courses, advanced diploma courses or first degree university courses depending on the 
student’s performance. 
 
Table 1.3 and figure 1.1 shows the performance of O-Level students in form IV CSEE 
National Examination as per Basic Statistics of National Data (2004) of the MoEVT 
between year 1995 and year 2003. The statistics show that students who obtained division 
I – division III ranges from 23% to 38% only while those who obtained division IV and 
division 0 ranges from 62% to 77%. Students with division I – division III are considered 
to have passed their examination and are the possible candidates to be selected to join 
either form VI (i.e. A-Level) or certificate courses.

When we consider science (Physics, Chemistry and Biology) and mathematics (advanced 
mathematics) subjects for A-level secondary school students between year 1999 and 
2004, we can see that students who obtained A, B and C grades ranges from 14% to 30% 
for physics, 13% to 23% for chemistry, 10% to 30% for biology and 19% to 39% for 
advanced mathematics. Performance evaluation using grading system is ranking ‘A’ to be 
the excellent pass while the value is respectively dropping to ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’ and ‘F’. 
‘F’ is ranked to be completely failure. I am grouping students with ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ to be 
the ones who have greater chance of being selected to join university degree courses or 
any other higher institutional courses. So far, the percentage of the best performance is 
  8 
 
not satisfying. Table 1.4 shows the ACSEE students performance starting from year 1999 
to year 2004.

With the poor performance observed in tables 1.3 and 1.4, statistics show that secondary 
schools in urban areas are highly ranked compared to those in rural areas as shown in 
table 1.5. Taking one urban area; Dar es Salaam, and two semi-urban areas Mbeya and 
Iringa as samples, we can see that in Dar es Salaam city many of its schools are ranked 
up to 100th out of 1080 O-Level secondary schools which sat for CSEE examination in 
2004, while Mbeya and Iringa regions schools are below those in Dar es Salaam, except 
for few privately owned schools.

There are several reasons to find a semi-urban or rural school highly ranked. Reasons 
including: 
• Seminary (mission-run) secondary schools; normally these schools get assistance 
from missionaries. St. Francis Girls’ secondary school in Mbeya region is a 
missionary owned school 
• Government special schools; top ranked students are being grouped together in 
identified schools and are provided with special facilities. Ifunda Technical 
secondary school in Iringa region and Iyunga secondary school in Mbeya region 
are special schools under this Government programme 
• Deliberate selection of highly ranked students (cream of students); these schools 
do not tolerate failures. This is mainly done by private secondary schools. St. 
Francis Girls’ secondary school in Mbeya region is  among these schools 
 
Problems for Tanzania secondary schools mentioned were justified by the second survey 
done in year 2006/2007. The survey is explained in part B of chapter 2: ICT Surveys.

1.2.3 The Need for e-Learning Management System 
 
Recesso (2001) pointed out that, each of the problems to education system has a direct 
impact on student learning, but it provides broader lens of considering potential use of 
ICT in education. Like any other developing country, Tanzania education system has to 
undergo substantial transformation, underscored by the growing application of new 
information and communications technology. The use of ICT in e-learning and related 
services has gained commercial significance. The benefits that can be derived from 
effective utilization of ICT include: cost reduction, performance improvement, quality 
enhancement and creation of new products and services. 
 
Learning design has the potential to develop e-learning by capturing the process of 
education, rather than simply content in the form of content objects (learning materials). 
Leaning involves a number of different users/roles with different ways to participate in 
the e-learning process. For the creation of distance learning materials to a distributed 
number of schools, Web-based learning environments are usually being used. Recesso 
(2001) state that: 
 
“Learning Management Systems (LMS) play a central role in the Web-based 
e-learning scenario. It connects learning contents and learners together in a 
standardized manner.  It manages users, learning materials (in the form of 
objects in Content Management System (CMS)) and learning events. It 
manages and administers learning progress and keep track on learning 
performance. It manages and administers administrative tasks. LMS is a 
software system designed to facilitate administrative tasks as well as student 
participation in e-learning materials”. 
 
Some rural secondary schools have acquired their personal computers (PCs) but are not 
used for teaching of normal subjects. Thus, the research project is on the development of 
an e-learning management system for Tanzanian secondary schools so as to make use of 
few available ICT resources to improve teaching and learning functions. The e-LMS to 
be developed will allow creation, storage, re-use and delivery of digital learning material, 
and manage these resources and users from central object repository.  
 
 
1.3 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES 
 
 
1.3.1 Main Objective 
 
The main objective of this research is to develop an interactive e-learning management 
system (e-LMS) to be used by Tanzanian secondary schools to support teaching and 
learning functions.  
 
 
 
  11 
 
1.3.2 Specific Objectives 
 
The following are the specific objectives (SO) based on the services to be offered by the 
e-learning management system: 
 
2SO1: To develop a module so as to enable creation, storing, publication and sharing of 
learning materials 
SO2: To develop mechanisms for protecting the database and the information stored, as 
well as manage users of the system and the workflow of the learning materials 
SO3: To develop ways of evaluating students’ learning progress through e-LMS, 
including means of assessment functions 
 
 
1.4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS 
 
The above specific objectives will be implemented based on the following research 
question (RQ): 
 
3RQ1:  How can learning materials content be made available and sharable among 
several students and teachers? 
RQ2: In which ways can the e-LMS database and the information stored inside, 
including learning materials be secured? 
RQ3: How can the e-LMS monitor the learning progress of students, as well as 
student’s understanding to the visited learning materials? 
 
 
1.5 RESEARCH OUTCOMES 
 
Socially, the developed e-LMS will:  
• Encourage collaboration among students, teachers and students/teachers using e-
mail regardless of their physical location and time 
• Make students and teachers reduce travel time and money that would otherwise be 
spent on traveling and accommodation expenses when seeking learning materials 
• Increase excitement and motivation in learning and  
• Encourage students to take responsibility for their learning and hence build self-
knowledge and self-confidence  
 
Pedagogically the developed e-LMS will: 
• Provide e-Learning teaching and learning materials to secondary school  
• Allow students to access and select learning materials as per their level of 
knowledge, thus, reduce the shortcomings caused by deficiency of books and 
libraries that are facing majority of Tanzanian secondary schools 
• Create equity in access of education resources to secondary schools

1.6 RESEARCH REGISTRATION 
 
The research involves two higher learning institutions for academic support, the UDSM 
(Tanzania) and the Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH − Sweden), where at both 
institutions I am registered as a PhD student. I am working with the College of 
Engineering and Technology (CoET) of the UDSM. UDSM is the site, where my 
research empirical work is taking place. The Division of Technoscience Studies at BTH 
offers relevant courses needed for the research through the licentiate program. BTH is 
together with UDSM responsible for the PhD program including the licentiate degree. 
This is a sandwich program where I spend eight months at UDSM and four months at 
BTH yearly for the whole research period. 
 
  
1.7 LIMITATION OF THE STUDY AND RESEARCH FOCUS 
 
e-LMS for Tanzanian secondary schools is aiming at supporting teaching and learning 
functions of the secondary education system, consequently improve performance of the 
students.  Measuring extent level of support and performance improvement is not a one 
day job. It requires ample time for the users to adopt and use e-LMS effectively starting 
from the time installed. This may go beyond my research time limit, hence the need to 
have the limitation of my study as follows: 
 
 The developed e-LMS will be prototyped for its functioning in a small Local Area 
Network (LAN) having few computers in a lab, an Apache application server and a 
MySQL database server.  
 
During development stage it is difficult to involve all Tanzania secondary schools. The 
focus will involve only few schools, in this case only two secondary schools from Kibaha 
region are selected. Hence another limitation that: 
 
 The e-LMS system will be installed at UDSM and configured to be used by the 
selected pilot schools at Kibaha. The two schools which are going to be involved at 
Kibaha pilot site are Kibaha secondary schools (KSS) and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ 
seminary. e-LMS system will be made fully applicable to these schools, and the 
objectives of the research will be measured to see if what was intended to be provided 
by e-LMS is fully covered.  
 
It is possible to use few selected schools because Tanzania has only one curriculum for 
all secondary schools registered under the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training 
(MoEVT). Features of the e-LMS will represent the standard form of any other secondary 
school registered by the MoEVT. The implemented e-LMS to these selected schools will 
  13 
 
latter be extended to all other secondary schools in Tanzania. Kibaha as a pilot site is 
elaborated more in chapter two. 
 
 
1.8 OUTLINE OF THE THESIS 
 
This thesis consists of 6 chapters apart from an overview of the ICT for e-learning 
project. Chapter one gives the general introduction of the research study. It shows the 
research problem area, the research objectives, research questions, outcomes of the 
research, limitation of the study and research focus. Chapter two gives an overview of the 
ICT surveys conducted. It also shows how pilot site Kibaha is selected. Chapter three 
shows the theoretical framework of research methodologies to be applied for this 
research. This research work stress on using participatory action research (PAR) 
methodology as a key way to a successful design of the e-LMS system. To create good 
relationship and sense of trust between the University of Dar es Salaam and secondary 
schools, students’ registration database using Microsoft access database engine has been 
created and installed in pilot school as an example of participatory work. Chapter 4 
covers theoretical review on Web-based technologies. In this case learning-by-doing 
technique is employed where the designed online bookstore database system is also 
included as part of the practical application of Web-based technologies. System 
requirements and specifications for the e-LMS to be developed is explicitly shown in 
Chapter five. Chapter six gives concluding remarks, where the final conclusion, main 
contribution, work done so far and future works are explained. Journal papers are 
included in appendix A.

2.0 ICT SURVEYS 
 
 
2.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
ICT for e-learning research project, which is more elaborated in sub-section 2.7.4, is the 
project conceived at the College of Engineering and Technology (CoET) of the 
University of Dar-es-Salaam (UDSM). The project is aiming at supporting teaching and 
learning functions to secondary schools, consequently, improve performance of schools. 
The ICT project started with a through study conducted by the research group. The aim of 
this study was to find out the ICT application status of secondary schools and their 
nearby environment from different regions in Tanzania. Research group included 
lecturers from the faculty of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering (ECSE) of the 
CoET, researchers from faculty of Education, officers from Tanzania 
Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL) and PhD students from the University of 
Dar es Salaam. The survey was conducted in two phases. The entire research group took 
part in the first phase of the survey in 2004 to be analyzed in Part A below. PhD students 
took part again in the second phase of survey in 2006/2007 to be analyzed in Part B 
below. The main purpose of the first survey was to study the level of e-readiness for 
project implementation. The second survey was for system requirement and analysis, 
whereby the specifics for the basic needs of the secondary schools’ stakeholders were 
identified.  
 
 
2.2 MEANS OF DATA COLLECTION 
 
 Interview 
Open-ended interview questionnaires were prepared and used to interview selected 
schools’ stakeholders (administrators, students and teachers) and organizations officers. 
Organizations involved were MoEVT, TTCL officers at the head quarters and at regional 
level as well as Regional/District Education Officers.  
 
 Physical Observations 
Physical observation on the real status of schools included libraries, laboratories for 
science subjects, number of teachers and their qualification, presence of computers and/or 
computer laboratories and their utilization. 
 
 Existing Documents 
Going through existing relevant documents was the other means of getting more 
information. Documents include National ICT policy, ICT for basic education and other 
relevant documents from MoEVT, searched documents from the Internet related to e-
learning in Tanzania, other research reports for e-learning in Tanzania, documents from 
semi-autonomous agencies of MoEVT like National Examinations Council of Tanzania 
(NECTA) and Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE) etc. 
 
 
  15 
 
 
 Participatory Action Research Methodology 
Data collection through interview, physical observation and existing documents were 
being applied in both surveys (survey one and two). 4Participatory action research 
methodology through focus group discussions was the key means of data collection for 
the second survey. The focus groups were organized as follows:  
• With students alone 
• With teachers alone 
• Joint discussion with students and teachers 
• With research members and  
• With MoEVT officers  
 
At school level, focus group participants were mainly from those who are closely 
associated with science and mathematics subjects.  
 
 
PART A: ICT APPLICATION STATUS IN TANZANIA BY 2004 
 
Ten areas from Tanzania regions and districts were chosen for the survey. A total of 40 
schools (at least three – four from each area) were selected, visited and surveyed. These 
areas were: Bagamoyo, Iringa, Kibaha, Kilwa, Mkuranga, Moshi, Morogoro, Mwanga, 
Arumeru and Same. The e-readiness for ICT survey included findings from National ICT 
policy of Tanzania, MoEVT ICT policy for basic education, data communication service 
providers, e-readiness at secondary schools in terms of computer availability, availability 
of necessary infrastructures such as electricity and telephone, e-learning projects for 
Tanzanian secondary schools which include ICT for e-learning project and finally 
supportive data from the concerned Ministry of Education and Vocational Training 
(MoEVT).  
 
 
2.3 NATIONAL ICT POLICY OF TANZANIA TOWARDS e-LEARNING 
 
Problems facing Tanzania education system have alerted the Government to realize the 
need of using ICT in education and to take initiative to incorporate e-learning objectives 
in the National ICT policy. The National ICT Policy of Tanzania (MoCT, 2003) points 
out that ICT encompasses telecommunications services, computers and associated 
peripherals, Internet services, e-mail, fax, broadcasting, televisions and other media. One 
of the objectives of the National ICT Policy of Tanzania is to use ICT to improve the 
quality of delivery of education and training in all areas including distance learning. 
Achieving these objectives is however a process – an implementation process with no 
ready made manuals to follow from the beginning. 
 
The National ICT Policy of Tanzania towards e-learning clearly mentions the following 
objectives showing its support to the education sector as a whole:

• Expand and develop the teaching of ICT at all levels of the National system of 
formal education, informal education and training 
• Expand and improve adult-education, life-long learning and both general and 
digital literacy programmes, notably for retraining and re-skilling the existing 
workforce  
• Give special attention to providing new learning and ICT access opportunities for 
women and youth, the disabled and disadvantaged, particularly disenfranchised 
and illiterate people, in order to address social inequities 
• Develop and deploy a nationwide e-education system that support schools, higher 
education/training facilities across the country by interconnecting them with each 
other and with relevant knowledge centres, providing curriculum integration 
while also generating information to better shape policies, strategic plans and 
tactical decisions for developing education and vocational training in Tanzania 
 
 
2.4 MOEVT ICT POLICY FOR BASIC EDUCATION 
 
The Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT) also believes that the use 
of ICT in teaching and learning as well as administration and management represents a 
powerful tool with which to achieve educational and National development objectives. 
The Ministry has therefore formulated “Policy for Basic Education” to guide the 
integration of ICT in basic education (MoEVT, 2007). Some of the objectives of ICT 
Policy for Basic Education related to e-learning are: 
• Promote the harmonization of activities, approaches and standards in the 
educational uses of ICT 
• Ensure that there exists equitable access to ICT resources by students, teachers 
and administrators in all regions and types of educational institutions and offices 
• Ensure the proper management and maintenance of ICT resources and tools 
• Ensure the organized provision of ICT training to students, teachers and 
educational administrators 
• Facilitate the implementation of communication and information systems for the 
effective management of the education sector 
• Facilitate the use of ICT as a tool for assessment and evaluation of education, as 
well as administration and management 
• Facilitate the use of ICT resources in schools and colleges by the neighboring 
community 
• Facilitate the development and use of ICT as a pedagogical tool for teaching and 
learning, and for the professional development of teachers, administrators and 
managers 
• Promote development of local content for basic education and other stakeholders 
 
 
2.5 DATA COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS 
 
Eight out of ten surveyed areas show that there is a Point of Presence (PoP) offering 
dedicated leased circuits (data) over Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) from 
  17 
 
SIMUNET to clients with bandwidth ranging from 64Kbps to 2Mbps. Areas without PoP 
are Mkulanga and Kilwa. SIMUNET Company Limited is one of the directorates 
(departments) in the Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL).  In 
addition to SIMUNET there is an alternative private data provider, SIMBANET offering 
wireless Internet connectivity to these areas too. With exceptional to two areas Mwanga 
and Kilwa, Mwanga area is using data connectivity from Moshi town by Wireless Local 
Loop (WLL) and the available data speeds are: 64kbps, 128kbps, 128kbps, 512kbps and 
2Mbps which are shared or dedicated. Kilwa is the only surveyed area which has 
completely no Internet connectivity. 
 
All areas, except Kilwa, have Internet Service Providers and mobile companies that are 
operational, providing communication services to complement wired network provided 
by TTCL. Mobile companies available are Celtel, Vodacom, and Mobile (now Tigo). 
Twaakyondo et al. (2002) indicates that mobile operators lease backbone transmission 
capacity (leased line) and interconnect through TTCL. 
 
National wide, TTCL is a Tanzania leading Government affiliated integrated 
telecommunications company, with a comprehensive portfolio of products and services 
including local, national and international telecommunications services as well as data 
communication, internet, and Information Technology (IT) solutions.  TTCL offers a 
wide range of telecommunication services to large corporations and companies, 
government, diplomatic missions, medium and small business enterprises, residential 
customers and the general public (Twaakyondo et al., 2002). 
 
TTCL has the most extensive telecommunications network covering all regions in the 
Tanzania Mainland and the Isles. TTCL data services cover the needs for communication 
between data nodes in different parts of the network. These include provision of Internet 
bandwidth and local connectivity between sites in different locations. TTCL data services 
comprise of the following (TTCL, 2006):  
• Broadband  
• Internet Bandwidth  
• Internet Protocol (IP) Virtual Private Network (VPN)  
• Leased Circuits  
 
TTCL delivers Internet based communication services through five broadband packages. 
Broadband standard is for home and mini-office use at the price of Tanzanian shillings 95 
(TZS 95) approximately to United States Dollar 0.08 (5USD 0.08) per megabyte (MB), 
broadband business corporate (10 Gigabyte (GB)) at the price of TZS 360,000 (USD 311) 
per month, broadband business café (20 GB) at the price of TZS 450,000 (USD 389) per 
month and broadband hotspot (50 GB) at the price of TZS 1,000,000 (USD 864) per 
month. All prices include Value Added Tax (VAT) of 20%. There is no restriction as to 
the number of computers that the customer can connect independent of the product 
choice (6TTCL, 2006). Twaakyondo et al. (2002) adds that TTCL broadband connection 
service is over a customer's existing TTCL telephone line, using Asymmetric Digital

Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology to separate voice and data signals. Broadband 
services can be delivered in different ways - over an ordinary telephone line or private 
network, via a cable connection or wireless networks.   
 
TTCL dedicated Internet bandwidth is a high speed, symmetrical Internet access services 
for corporate Internet users, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and business users. The 
product enables corporate organizations, enterprises and ISPs to gain access to 
guaranteed Internet bandwidth for high end Web applications in the corporate working 
environments, for business use and for resale to subscribers (TTCL, 2006). TTCL 
backbone network has the widest coverage in Tanzania with all regional centers and 
some districts covered by the Internet Protocol (IP) backbone network through 
microwave radio links. Currently TTCL is upgrading all regional links utilizing 
microwave technology to fiber optic technology that will give unmatched reliability, 
lowest latency and highest possible speed (TTCL, 2006). 
 
TTCL IP Virtual Private Network (VPN) product provides dedicated end-to-end 
connectivity to link multiple sites through TTCL's IP backbone network. The service 
offers solution to corporate organizations and enterprises with wide branch network for 
networking and thus enabling them to seamlessly extend their applications to all branches 
reliably, securely and efficiently (TTCL, 2006). Prices for IP VPN are as shown in table 
2.1.

Among other services, TTCL also offers a range of digital and analogue private leased 
circuits capable of carrying voice, data or video traffic. TTCL leased circuits offer 
constant and permanent access between offices and/or headquarters, between other 
data/voice service provider's nodes or between their nodes and their customers. Private 
leased circuits (leased lines) are available in various bandwidths, from 64 Kbps to 2,048 
Kbps (2 Mbps8) and more as the customer may need. Private leased circuits offered by 
TTCL have several advantages: 
• Private leased circuits are permanently connected, offering instant communication 
and are leased on a fixed tariff basis, regardless of usage  
                                                 
7 Kbps – Kilobits per Second 
8 Mbps – Megabits per Second 
  19 
 
• Private leased circuit service’s bandwidth is dedicated to the connected parties 
and is not shared or switched, thus providing the best quality of service 
• Private leased circuits are also very secure offering security at physical level and 
hence proven and trusted as compared to the use of public networks 
• TTCL private leased circuits are provided over the terrestrial backbone network 
thus guaranteeing lowest latency 
 
Tariff for leased circuits depend on the distance range from the Internet Exchange Points 
(IXP). Taking few distance ranges, table 2.2 shows the digital leased line prices per 
month in USD while installation charges for all leased lines are USD 600.00 (VAT 
exclusive).

Yonah (2002) indicates that  Tanzania now has over 30 PoPs: Located in over 15 regions 
- Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Moshi, Tanga, Dodoma, Morogoro, Iringa, Mbeya, Singida, 
Tabora, Shinyanga, Mwanza, Musoma, Moshi, Mtwara, and  Zanzibar. 
 
Apart from having TTCL, Tanzania is now having six more companies licensed by the 
then Tanzanian Communication Commission (TCC), now Tanzania Communication 
Regulatory Authority (TCRA) to provide data communication services. These companies 
include: Wilken Afsat, Datel Tanzania, Equant Tanzania, Simbanet Tanzania, Soft Tech 
Tanzania and Fastcom Africa. Out of these, Wilken Afsat, Datel and Simbanet appear to 
be the most active (Miller et al., 2001; Twaakyondo et al., 2002). These companies are 
permitted to install infrastructure for data communication purposes but not for voice.  
 
 
2.6 e-READINESS IN TANZANIA SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
 
When looking to the availability of telecommunications services, Internet services, 
computers and associated peripherals to Tanzania secondary schools, the survey analysis 
show that at least many of them have acquired computers, either  from their own effort  
by purchasing from their schools’ fund or through donors and some from the 
Government. Due to the high costs, very few schools have managed to acquire Internet 
service.  
 
Table 2.3 and figure 2.1 show the analysis on availability of computers from 40 surveyed 
secondary schools taken from ten surveyed areas of Tanzania mainland. From the 
analysis, it can be seen that only 14 (35%) schools out of forty (40) surveyed secondary 
schools had no computers. 65% surveyed schools at least had one or more computers, out 
of which 10 (25%) schools had from one to three computers being used for secretarial 
  20 
 
services; 5 (13% approximately) schools had between 4 and 15 computers being used for 
secretarial services and computer literacy training; and the remaining 11 (27% 
approximately) schools had more than 16 computers also being used for secretarial 
services and computer literacy training.

It can also be seen from table 2.4 that approximately 10% of 40 surveyed secondary 
schools had Internet service. Though the Internet service is mainly accessed to the head 
of computer unit, headmasters/ headmistresses and/or staff, still it is a good start towards 
the use of ICT in education.

Coming to the electrical power availability, 24 schools (85%) out of the 40 schools 
visited use Tanzania Electric Company Limited (TANESCO) power. 3 schools (7%) use 
generators for their schools’ use. The remaining 3 school had no power. Majority of 
schools had working telephone facilities. Few of the schools had well secured computer 
laboratories, and the remaining was ready to construct computer laboratories. 
 
Furthermore issue related to electrical energy is that TANESCO in its Web site 
“http://www.tanesco.com/” shows the status of electricity in year 2006. Part of the 
statement says that:  “By the end of year 2006, Tanzania Mainland had 21 regions and 
113 districts. All the Regional Headquarters so far have electricity. Of the 113 districts, 
95 district headquarters have electricity while 18 do not have” (TANESCO, 2006). 
TANESCO is a parastatal organization created in 1964 and is under the Ministry of 
Energy and Minerals. The company’s core business is to generate, transmit, distribute 
and sell electricity to customers in Tanzania mainland and bulk supply to the island of 
Zanzibar. 
 
The adequacy of infrastructures and logistics in schools is a condition to the availability 
and use of ICT. In this respect Addo (2001) argues that the critical requirements include 
computers, a school computer laboratory, a school library; electricity, a telephone and 
security for the safekeeping of expensive computer systems. 
 
 
2.7 e-LEARNING PROJECTS FOR TANZANIAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS 
 
The effort shown by Tanzania Government to improve teaching and learning is to raise 
the standard of teachers’ preparation programs, increase degree attainment of teachers 
and increase classroom strategies in service training. The Government is making big 
effort to improve the situation but is overwhelmed by the rate of the increase of 
secondary schools and students. Learning resources and teachers are stretched beyond 
limits. One of several ways to encounter these constrains is to make use of ICT, and 
below are some of the projects trying to incorporate ICT in learning. 
 
 
2.7.1 Implementation of IP Based VPN Connectivity in Tanzania 
 
Simba (2005) in her Masters Degree research titled “Implementation of Internet Protocol 
Virtual Private Network (IP Based VPN) Connectivity in Tanzania”, successfully 
designed and implemented a Wide Area Network (WAN) to interconnect a number of 
individual secondary schools computer Local Area Networks (LANs) which are 
geographically dispersed within Tanzania by using the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) 
− Virtual Private Network (VPN) technique.  
 
The e-LMS to be developed is a Web-based learning management system aiming to serve 
a number of distributed secondary schools in different locations. Data exchange and 
sharing can be performed by computer network systems with Internet service. The e-
LMS database will be installed in a centralized server located at the faculty of Electrical 
  22 
 
and Computer Systems Engineering (ECSE) of the CoET, University of Dar es Salaam. 
The e-LMS database will be viewed in a shared manner with all users (stakeholders) of 
the system using their computers (here referred as clients) which support standard Web 
browsers. These clients are supposed to be networked to the e-LMS database server. 
 
With Simba’s work means that it is possible to incorporate the e-LMS database server in 
the already developed WAN and make many schools access and use learning materials 
stored in e-LMS database.  
 
 
2.7.2 IICD Projects 
 
Efforts in improving secondary education in Tanzania using ICT also show that there are 
many more projects undertaken by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO). Like, the 
International Institute for Communication and Development (IICD) which is an 
independent non-profit foundation established by the Netherlands Minister for 
Development Cooperation in 1997. IICD supports many countries with ICT projects 
including Tanzania. In Tanzania, ICT projects supported by IICD include: 
 
 The project titled “Tanzania Education (TanEdu) Web Site” with the uniform 
resource locator (URL) http://www.tanedu.org. The aim of this project is to provide 
timely, accurate and reliable information about education services all over Tanzania. 
The Web site also includes information about schools’ examinations, schools’ 
administration and the latest news in education sector. The news bulletin contains 
articles targeted to students, teachers and parents (TanEdu newsletter, 2005). 
 
 The Distance Learning and Education Services (DLES) project with the collaboration 
of Royal Dutch Embassy. DLES in their Web site URL http://www.diles.or.tz, aim in 
delivering educational materials to secondary schools’ students in Tanzania free of 
charge. Many of the Web sites available are static Web sites and accesses to these 
Web sites are limited to urban schools’ students who have access to Internet cafes.  
 
 
2.7.3 Projects with MoEVT 
 
The concerned Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT) have many 
planned projects, some already started. One of them is the project titled “ICT 
Implementation in Teachers’ Colleges” (http://www.teachers.or.tz). In August 2005, the 
Government of the United Republic of Tanzania in collaboration with the Swedish 
Government through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) 
initiated a project for introducing ICT in all government teachers’ colleges. The project’s 
main goal is to improve the quality of pre-service and in-service teacher education by 
using ICT. It is expected that principals, tutors and students will be trained in ICT to be 
able to use ICT as a tool for teaching and learning as well as for management and 
administration (MoEVT, 2007). The MoEVT (2006) in its eSchool programme document 
state that: 
  23 
 
“Already colleges of education in the country are being provided with 
ICT facilities so that when teachers graduate they are ICT literate and 
can use computers for teaching and learning”  
 
ICT Implementation in Teachers’ Colleges is a very important project to the ICT for e-
learning to Tanzanian secondary schools project. The importance comes in facilitating 
and enhancing the whole issue towards the use of e-LMS system in secondary schools. 
We need users to have the knowledge of ICT even in developing stages to make the PAR 
design easy.  
 
In order to support and implement some of the objectives of the National ICT policy, the 
MoEVT through its semi-autonomous agency Tanzania Institute of Education (TIE) has 
developed ICT syllabi for primary and secondary education: Teknolojia ya Habari na 
Mawasiliano (TEHAMA) for primary schools and Information and Computer Studies 
(ICS) for secondary schools. TIE is currently finalizing ICT syllabi for teacher education. 
Two syllabi have been proposed: ICT Academic as a specialization subject and ICT 
Pedagogy as a compulsory subject for all student teachers (MoEVT, 2007). 
 
 
2.7.4 ICT for e-Learning Project for Tanzanian Secondary Schools  
 
To complement such mentioned efforts in a more dynamic way, the University of Dar-es-
Salaam through its College of Engineering and Technology conceived a research project 
to develop a tool to enable ICT support rural secondary schools. The focus is to enable 
ICT support with teaching materials, which are user friendly, facilitating self learning and 
information sharing, starting with science and mathematics subjects.  
 
The success of this research work is depicted on three basic pillars as shown in figure 2.2. 
These are “establishment of suitable and effective connectivity and configuration”, 
“development of a context centered platform which includes e-learning management 
system using open source software” and “development of local content materials to self 
learning environment and sharing”. To minimize operational costs open source platform 
has been chosen. This research takes part on developing an interactive e-learning 
management system (shaded area in figure 2.2) for Tanzanian secondary schools.

2.7.4.1 Development of e-LMS 
 
e-Learning is an attentive concept, subject to a wide variation in practice, but which 
nevertheless has become an established component of education delivery worldwide. 
Akeroyd (2005) argues that one extreme best use of e-learning is in utilizing the Web 
technology to facilitate the whole cycle of learning from initial sign-on to final 
certification, with a range of operations in between, and with no or little, physical 
interaction among learners. The birth of World Wide Web (WWW) opened up a new 
dimension to computer based training. WWW enables learners learn online anywhere, 
anytime and provides possibilities for huge cost savings in corporate training. Online 
learning has created excellent opportunities to access learning and new ways for 
collaboration (Akeroyd, 2005).  
 
Watson et al. (2004) argue that the e-learning industry, which includes different groups of 
users and different knowledge requirements, requires a more manageable system: one, 
which could monitor the learners’ learning, measures it and provide reports on learning 
efficiency. This requires constant tracking of the learners’ actions and results of online 
tests, and this can be achieved by the use of learning management systems (LMS). LMS 
provide a technological, parameter driven framework to allow individual academics to 
develop and deliver learning content, to interact with students and to facilitate open 
discussion.  
 
Watson et al. (2004) continue to argue that many LMS have been developed to provide a 
wide range of different features to enable e-learning. All of them aim to deliver four main 
features: delivery training content, tracking of student performance, management of 
learning materials and learners, and provision of tools for students’ collaboration. 
 
The basic LMS is a Web application where the learner logs on and accesses the learning 
materials allocated to her/him. While the learner is going through the learning materials 
repository, the LMS stores information about the learners’ interactions, such as scores 
and answers to the questions. LMS use this information to analyze how well the learner is 
performing, and is able to provide reports to the administrators and tutors, identifying 
how well individuals or groups are performing in learning materials or curricula. In this 
regard, Watson et al. (2004) argue that a LMS commonly contains an interface for 
managing users, adding/deleting new learners, organizing learners into hierarchy and 
allocating access rights to users. 
 
 
2.7.4.2 Kibaha Pilot Site 
 
Tanzania has only one curriculum for all secondary schools registered under the Ministry 
of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT), which are majority in Tanzania. During 
development stage it will not be easy to involve all scattered Tanzania secondary schools. 
The ICT for e-learning project decided to start with the selected pilot site. The criteria for 
selecting the pilot site were: accessibility, at least four schools which are nearby, two of 
them to have both ordinary-level and advanced-level with science subjects and difference 
  25 
 
in performance ranking and finally to be of both genders. Kibaha was among the area 
which happened to suite the mentioned criteria. 
 
Kibaha as shown in figure 2.3 is one of the six districts and the regional headquarters of 
Pwani region in Tanzania. Kibaha is 40km from Dar es Salaam and easily accessible by 
road (from Dar es Salaam, about 30-40 minutes drive). Kibaha is supplied with 
TANESCO National Grid. Most of the Kibaha residents depend on one or more of the 
following activities for their livelihood: employment, business and agriculture. The 
community has exposure to ICT through existence of two computer-training centers 
(Njuweni Hotel and Kaece Computer Centre), Internet cafes and several secretarial shops 
offering computer-based services. Normal telephone services are easily available. 
 
TTCL regional office has Point of Presence (PoP) offering dedicated leased circuits (data 
over PSTN) to clients with scalable bandwidth ranging from 64Kbps to 2Mbps. The 
maximum distance for data connectivity using leased lines is 3-5 km (2 wires). Also there 
is a wireless option for Internet connectivity via radio links.  
 
In Kibaha area, the survey covered a total of four secondary schools. These are Kibaha 
Secondary School, Wali-ul-Asr Girls’ Seminary, Tumbi Secondary School and Pwani 
Secondary School, each with quite different level of performance. Kibaha secondary 
schools and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary are the schools selected to be our pilot schools. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Apart from many other reasons used to select Kibaha town as a pilot site, the two 
earmarked schools have quite different motivations which can be used as a challenge in 
making students share resources from e-LMS system to be developed. Tables 2.5, 2.6 and

2.8 SECOND SURVEY OVERVIEW 
 
The aim of the second survey was to find, identify and substantiate problems facing 
Tanzanian secondary schools. Solutions on how to overcome identified problems lead to 
having system requirement for e-LMS to be developed. The survey was done in 
2006/2007 and it was a joint survey done by two PhD students Ms. Suzan Lujara and 
myself (Ms. Ellen Kalinga). 
 
Six areas were selected for this survey, namely Kibaha, Bagamoyo, Songea, Mbeya, 
Dodoma and Arusha. At least six schools were visited and surveyed in each area. Further 
more, educational institutions were also visited to find the documented issues concerning 
Tanzania secondary schools. These institutions include MoEVT and National 
Examinations Council of Tanzania (NECTA) a semi-autonomous agency of the MoEVT. 
 
For secondary schools, open-ended questioners were designed to get the needed 
information like; the status of books and reference materials availability, adequacy on 
teaching staff and how they solve the problem if not adequate, what are the subjects with 
critical shortage of teaching staff, qualifications of teaching staff, availability of 
computers at schools, usage of computer if available at schools etc.  
 
 
2.9 SECOND SURVEY RESULTS 
 
With respect to the main objective of the e-learning project, which states “To improve the 
quality of science education in secondary school in the rural areas of Tanzania”, 
identification of problems for Tanzanian secondary schools education and how to 
overcome them were obtained through answering three main questions: 
 
 What are the reasons for poor performance? 
Reasons for poor performance are clearly identified in chapter one under “statement of 
the problem” section 1.2. Reasons identified include shortage of teachers, inadequacy 
of books, references and other basic academic resource materials. These problems are 
being accelerated by the increased number of schools and students compared to the 
increased number of teacher and learning resources. 
 
  28 
 
 To what extent is the poor performance?  
Extents for poor performance are also clearly stated and analyzed in chapter one 
under “statement of the problem” section 1.2. Extents considered are results for the 
National Examination performance, pass grading for mathematics and science 
subjects (chemistry, physics and biology) in National Examination and ranking of 
urban secondary schools National Examination performance compared to rural 
secondary schools. 
 
 How can students’ performance be improved?  
When e-learning stakeholders were consulted for this, the followings two issues 
seemed to be the mostly needed by majority of them: 
• The need to have more self learning materials especially in science and 
mathematics subjects, 
• The need to have a good number of self test questions and past paper examination 
questions for practice 
 
 
2.10 DISCUSSION 
 
Tanzanian education system at secondary school level has to undergo substantial 
transformation, underscored by the growing application of new information and 
communications technology.  The study shows that the country is gradually entering the 
global information society however the available resources limit the pace considerably. 
There is a positive trend towards the use of ICT in e-learning in all major parties 
concerning secondary schools.  
 
The use of ICT provides innovative ways to complement the traditional student-teacher 
interaction worldwide, to optimize resource usage, sharing and collaboration. Therefore, 
the development of e-learning facilities for rural areas of Tanzania has high National 
priorities and hence relevance. Application of ICT in e-learning that is accessible even in 
remote and rural secondary schools will improve the performance of students in such 
secondary schools as well as raising morale for teachers and students. The coming 
chapter gives the research methodology employed to develop e-LMS for Tanzanian 
secondary schools. 
  
  29 
 
3.0 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 
 
3.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
There are a lot of results in the field of software engineering concerning the question on 
how to represent systems and how to build a base for communication between the 
developer and the user of a software system (Walker et al., 1998). In order to manage the 
return investment in ICT for education, here referred to e-learning management system 
(e-LMS), it is essential that the benefits, risks and cost effectiveness of using new 
technology and new media are well understood in the context of application. An effective 
approach is to involve users in establishing the expected use of ICT and the benefit of it 
in education.  
 
The e-LMS to be developed is for Tanzanian secondary schools’ members, who many of 
them are not aware of the ICT technology use in education. Modeling methodology is the 
best way to create visualization of the system to be defined. With modeling, complex and 
real-world systems can be somehow understood, qualities of the system can be predicted 
and communication with stakeholders concerning the key characteristics will be 
promoted (Brown, 2004). Models are developed as a way of creating a base for 
implementation of the physical system and testing. Integrating the participatory action 
research methodology with the whole issue of employing Model-Driven Architecture 
(MDA) is of significance. Participatory action research methodology and modeling 
support each other, when it comes to the software development for users. 
 
Methodologies adopted in this research are presented as follows: 
 Qualitative research methodology where participatory action research (PAR) 
methodology is being emphasized. This part also presents the designed student’s 
registration database for Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary as the starting point of 
participatory action research methodology and a base of creating good relationship 
and sense of trust between the University of Dar es Salaam and secondary schools. 
Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary is one of the schools from the selected pilot site – 
Kibaha. 
 Software development methodology where object oriented system analysis and 
design (OOSA&D) approach with the Unified Modeling Language (UML) are 
employed. 
 Model Driven Architecture which emphasize the power of model in software 
development. 
 Selection and customization of open source learning management system (LMS) 
platforms will bring the e-LMS to its functionality as per Tanzanian secondary 
schools’ requirement and specification, lastly. 
 Mirroring and replication of the database so as to ensure high availability to end 
users. 
 
Lastly this chapter will discuss on related works with this research work.

3.2 PARTICIPATORY ACTION RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 
Research methods can be classified in various ways; main two are quantitative and 
qualitative. The development of e-LMS will base on qualitative research methods where 
qualitative data resources include; observation (field work), interview and questioners, 
documents and texts. There are various qualitative research methods, and the choice of 
which one to employ is being influenced in the way the researcher collects data. In this 
research, participatory action research methodology will be applied. 
 
Rowley (2003) says that with participatory action research, action and research proceed 
concurrently. Participatory action research depends upon a collaborative problem solving 
relationship between the researcher and the clients which aim to both solve a problem and 
generate new knowledge. Rowley (2003) elaborates more by quoting the key aspects of 
Gummessons’s (2000) characterization of participatory action research as follows: 
• Participatory action research take action 
• Participatory action research always involves the two roles of solving the problem 
(the role of the consultant) and making a contribution to knowledge (the role of a 
researcher) 
• Participatory action research requires interaction and cooperation between 
researchers and the client personnel 
• Participatory action research can include all types of data gathering methods 
(physical observations, interviews, questioners, focus group discussion, 
documents and texts) 
 
 
3.2.1 Participatory Action Research Cycle 
 
The importance of considering users in developing computer systems has been 
recognized since the 1970s (Abels et al., 1998). Systems development encompasses the 
complete range of activities involved in the process of analyzing, designing, 
implementing and maintaining an information system (Hirschheim et al., 1995; Jeremy, 
2000). It is here taken as obvious that analysis and design cannot be separated from users 
social contexts for the purpose of study, and that all social factors that impinge on 
development are worthy of study, with appropriate research methods. Systems 
development should be taken to be ‘multidimensional social change’ (Jeremy, 2000; 
Lyytinen, 1987). The need for an analytical model for work-oriented information system 
research and practice comes from the requirement that people doing their everyday tasks 
and duties should have an opportunity to make an impact on the prospective information 
systems. Information systems should be developed in their organizational context. 
 
O’Brien (2001) states that participatory action research or sometimes known as 
participatory research is “learning by doing”, that is a group of people identify a problem, 
do something to resolve it, scrutinize their efforts and if not satisfied, try it again. Walker 
et al. (1998) also argue that participatory design and continuous business improvement 
can be brought together in a framework which presents a set of different phases in a 
cyclic order. In the Nordic countries the “Scandinavian model” was introduced in the 
  31 
 
middle of the 80s (Ehn et al., 2000), introducing a participatory approach involving users 
for context sensitive and robust IT system solutions. Coming closer to a sub Sahara 
African context the participatory action research conducted in the presented project is 
more likely linked to participatory rural appraisal (PRA) introduced by Chambers (1997) 
and Rydhagen (2002). 
 
The participatory action research cycle as proposed by Coghlan et al. (2001) and referred 
by Rowley (2003) is as shown in figure 3.1. It involves four main stages, with one pre-
stage: 
 Context and purpose is a pre-stage focused on the establishment of the background 
for the participatory action research intervention. This stage suggests the necessity of 
change focusing particularly to external factors and internal forces 
 Diagnosing is concerned with the identification of the issues, and therefore, the focus 
for action. It corresponds to the identification of the primary problems that are the 
underlying causes of the organization’s desire for change. In keeping with the spirit of 
participatory action research, diagnosis must be a collaborative venture, so that the 
process commences with a shared understanding of the basis for subsequent action 
 Planning action is the stage that is concerned with planning the intervention. This 
activity specifies organizational actions that should relieve or improve these primary 
problems. Like diagnosis, planning should be collaborative 
 Taking action is the step during which plans are implemented and interventions 
enacted 
 Evaluation action is the step that offers the opportunity to focus on the outcomes of 
the intervention. Outcomes are evaluated in terms of whether the desired outcome has 
been achieved, but also in order to assess whether:  
• The original diagnosis was correct  
• The action taken was appropriate 
 
The review in this stage leads into the diagnosis stage of the next cycle of participatory 
action research.

3.2.2 e-LMS with Participatory Action Research Methodology 
 
The knowledge on how ICT and its application can improve social and economical lives 
of people generally is not very much known to many of the Tanzanian communities. 
Although, Tanzanian secondary schools may have and be in contact with computers, it 
doesn’t mean that they really understand the impact of ICT if effectively used towards 
improving performance. Coming to the issue of developing e-LMS for their use, if lack of 
knowledge is not carefully considered, the utilization motivation of the e-LMS may be 
very minimal or completely ignored. The emphasis of participatory action research 
methodology is to be a methodology which accompanies the introduction of technology 
into organizations and learning. Participatory action research methodology represents a 
specific form of knowledge generation thus, with participatory action research 
methodology the understanding of the use of e-LMS will be possible and hence increase 
assurance towards its utilization in future. 
 
Users mainly students, teachers and school administrators are considered to be the 
primary source of data. They will be involved in the whole process of developing e-LMS, 
starting from requirement phase through implementation phase. Means of participatory 
action research methodology was explained more in chapter two of this research, also 
presented by Kalinga et al. (2007).  
 
 
3.2.3 Development of Students’ Registration Database System 
 
There are many ICT application activities needed by Tanzanian secondary schools to 
ensure easy and comfortable daily administrative operations apart from ICT use 
academically. One area which is being implemented almost manually by many secondary 
schools is in keeping records for registered students. In order to enable the schools start 
utilizing the ICT facilities effectively, the project decided also to develop a student 
registration database system. To start with, only pilot schools were considered. Student 
registration database designed was for Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary. The database can suit 
any secondary school subject to slight modifications as per individual school’s 
requirements. Student’s registration database was a joint design of three PhD students 
namely Ellen A. kalinga (myself), Suzan K. Lujara and Fatuma Simba. To speedup this 
service, Microsoft Access database engine was used with the support of the Visual Basic 
(VB) programming. The only reason for selecting Microsoft access was because we were 
more familiar with the language. 
 
 
3.2.3.1 Main Objective 
 
To develop a functional database system as per the context of a certain organization 
depends much more on how end users are involved during the whole process of 
development. Finding appropriate system requirements depends on how close the 
developer is to the system stakeholders. Participatory action research methodology as 
employed by the qualitative research methodology is a key to be closer to the actors.  
  33 
 
Naslund (2002) states that qualitative researchers believe that they can get closer to the 
actor’s perspective through detailed interviewing and observation as emphasized to be the 
techniques adopted by participatory action research methodology. With this regard, 
student registration database was developed for the purpose of building good relationship 
and sense of trust between the UDSM and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary. For the success of 
the development of e-LMS, it is very important to be close to end users because they are 
the ones who to a big extent know what the deficits are in education system and what 
they really need to improve their performance. Students’ registration database system was 
the starting point to be close to stakeholders of the e-LMS. Students’ registration database 
also introduced me on basics and an overview of designing relational databases using 
structured approach. 
 
 
3.2.3.2 Wali-ul-Asr Students’ Registration Database  
 
Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary is a secondary school privately owned by the Muslim 
Missionary from Iran. The school is getting students from other countries too apart from 
Tanzania. Records for registered students were partially done using Microsoft Excel 
where data were transferred from admission/registration form to Microsoft Excel.  
 
Students’ Registration database is intended to facilitate easy data record keeping of the 
registered students as per Wali-ul-Asr context. Information needed for the database was 
gathered through group discussion with school administrators and concerned personnel 
participating in recording and keeping data for registered students. To get clearly what 
information to be gathered before registering a student, source of data also came from 
admission/registration forms which were used during the process. Information gathered 
in this form included information for a student as a person, parent/guardian information, 
disability/allergy and vaccination information, past academic records, fee and 
sponsorship information and dormitory allocation for borders. Participatory further went 
on asking reports needed by the school. With this information, the design came up with 
the entity relationship diagram (ERD) as shown in figure 3.2. ERD was the base for 
designing the database system. 
 
Input to Wali-ul-Asr Students’ Registration Database include information like subject 
combination, country of residence, dormitories, fee structure, nationality, vaccination, 
students’ particulars, parents/guardian information, application records, accommodation 
allocation, fee transaction records, form (level of class) allocated, students’ sponsor 
information, presence of certificates, name of the staff entered the information and other 
useful remarks. 
 
Output reports titles for Wali-ul-Asr Students’ Registration Database include overall list 
of registered students, list of registered students by registration date, student’s 
accommodation, dormitory status, specific student’s particulars, list of students based on 
gender and many other as shown in figure 3.3.

Data entry is done using interface forms. Figure 3.4 shows student form which is 
embedded with four pages namely particulars, parents/guardian, application and 
registration. Student form also comprises of four command buttons namely 
accommodation, vaccination, fee transaction and form which facilitate the process of 
inserting information regarding accommodation, vaccination, fee transaction and form 
allocation for a selected student respectively. By clicking any of these buttons, a new 
form called student details is opened. To enter information using these buttons can be 
done either by clicking one button at a time or clicking any button and use the 
corresponding embedded pages in student details form as shown in figure 3.5. 
 
 
3.3 OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 
 
There are several software development methodologies employed. The most commonly 
applied approaches are structured approach and object oriented (OO) approach. 
 
Yourdon (1991) says that the structured approach has since been reckoned to be the most 
widely used methodology. Yourdon (1991), Davis (1983) and Kendall (1996), also 
explain that structured approach prescribes analyzing and designing software system 
through functional decomposition. It examines an information system in terms of the 
functions it performs and the data it uses and maintains. Structured approach identifies 
the major functions or processes of a system, then breaks or decomposes each function 
down into its smaller composite steps (Davis, 1983; Kendall, 1996). Furthermore, 
techniques which are invariably present in many methodologies, such as entity 
relationship diagrams, dataflow diagrams and data dictionaries are also clearly 
mentioned. 
 
Thomann (1994) indicates that Object-oriented (OO) approach has been identified as the 
new paradigm for system development.  OO decomposes the system down into objects, 
that is, it examines the system in terms of the components in the system and how these 
components act and interrelate. The analyst first identifies the objects that comprise the 
system, then creates an object model which groups the objects into classes, and describes 
each class in terms of its attributes (or data), methods (or functions) and relationships to 
other classes (Schach, 2004). 
 
The key idea in object orientation is that: the real world can be accurately described as a 
collection of objects that interact.  An object model includes four components: objects 
(that is abstract data structures), classes (i.e. abstract data types), inheritance (hierarchical 
relationships among Abstract Data Types: ADT) and polymorphism by inheritance. 
 
In software development, successful Information System is subject to frequent evaluation 
and revision within a framework known as System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). 
Davis et al. (1988) argue that SDLC is the basic for most software development 
methodologies. Pressman (1997) adds to this by pointing out that system’s life cycle 
consists of four principal phases:  
 
  37 
 
 Requirement Phase as the process whereby the users’ needs in a software project are 
identified modeled and validated. Arayici et al. (2005) comment that this phase is 
regarded as one of the most important aspects of building an information system 
because it is during this process that what is to be built is decided. It is an iterative 
process by which the needs and requirements of individuals and groups significant to 
the development are researched and identified. Requirements phase defines:  
customer, user and market requirements; design requirements; and technical 
requirements. 
 
 Analysis Phase as the major information source for design of a new system. It 
specifies the system objectives and describes the work and its constraints to which 
designers have to comply. 
 
 Design Phase as where architecture is established. The phase starts with requirement 
documentation delivered by the requirement and analysis phases and maps the 
requirements into architecture. 
 
 Testing/Implementation Phase as where the system is built. The implementation 
phase deals with issues of quality, performance, baselines, libraries, and debugging. 
The end deliverable is the product itself. 
 
These phases address what is to be built, how it will be built, building it and increase the 
quality to highest possible standard. 
 
This research will adopt Object Oriented (OO) approach. Under this approach Booch et 
al. (2001) argue that the process of object-oriented analysis (OOA) from SDLC is 
composed of the following activities: requirement capturing, specification component 
identification, and specification representation. During requirement capturing: several 
function-viewed notations are used, including context diagram of the structured analysis 
(SA) technique, use case diagrams and activity diagrams of the unified modeling 
language (UML). During specification component identification a systematic procedure 
is provided to identify class and their attributes from data, and to identify class operations 
from CRC (class, responsibility, and collaborator) cards, and during specification 
representation most notations used are from UML. 
 
An OOA technique is generally composed of an OOA process to analyze requirements 
and identify specification components (e.g., classes and class relationships), and an OOA 
model to represent specifications. UML can be used for OO models in all phases of 
software development, including OOA. In this connection Chen et al. (2000) say that 
OOA provides rich notations for representing OO components, such as classes, objects, 
object behaviors of classes, object interactions and even functions (use cases and activity 
diagrams). 
 
The UML is the standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and 
documenting all the components of a software system (OMG, 2003b). With UML, a 
software system can be described at various levels of granularity (example the system 
  38 
 
level, the subsystem level, and the class level.) and from various viewpoints (example the 
logical view and the use-case view). UML helps to simplify the process of software 
design, making a model for construction with a number of different views. UML can help 
in the following ways: aiding understanding of complex systems, exploring and 
comparing design alternatives at a low cost, forming a foundation for implementation, 
capturing requirements precisely, communicating decisions unambiguously and is a 
simplification of reality. UML is also the one adopted by Model Driven Approach 
(MDA), the one planned to be used in this research. 
 
The e-LMS is a system to be developed hence will abide to System Development Life 
Cycle (SDLC). SDLC for e-LMS will have: 
• System Requirement and Specification phase where use-case diagram will be 
used 
• System Analysis and System Design phase where conceptual, sequence, 
collaboration, design class and component diagrams will be used 
• System Implementation phase where user interface and the application programs 
(coding) that use and process the database will be designed and implemented 
• Testing Phase where the developed system will be tested  
 
 
3.4 MODEL DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE 
 
Design through modeling, which is a norm in the engineering domains, enforces a careful 
investigation of the structure, behavior and architecture of a system in the early stages of 
development and promotes documentation and reuse. Czarnecki et al. (2005) mention 
that the Object Management Group (OMG) initiative Model Driven Architecture (MDA) 
attempts to separate application functionality specification from the implementations of 
that functionality on specific technology platforms. This approach is intended to play a 
key role in the fields of information system and software engineering. MDA is supposed 
to provide a basic technical framework for information integration and tool 
interoperability based on the separation of platform specific models (PSM) from platform 
independent models (PIM). 
 
MDA guide indicate that PIM represent the functionality and behavior of a system and 
capture only the application logic. PIM is then converted to PSM, which capture the 
technology-specific details of a system implementation. The separation of concerns 
between the application and technical aspects of a system promotes separate, yet, 
controlled evolution of both aspects of the system based on different needs. The primary 
goals of MDA are portability, interoperability and reusability through architecture 
separation of concerns (OMG, 2003a). A key standard in the MDA is based on Unified 
Modeling Language (UML) as recommended by OMG. 
 
Brown et al. (2005) insist that models provide abstractions of a physical system that 
allow engineers to reason about that system by ignoring extraneous details while focusing 
on relevant ones. All forms of engineering rely on models to understand complex, real-
world systems. Models are used in many ways: to predict system qualities, reason about 
  39 
 
specific properties when aspects of the system are changed, and communicate key system 
characteristics to various stakeholders. The models may be developed as an originator to 
implementing the physical system, or they may be derived from an existing system or a 
system in development as an aid to understanding its behavior. 
 
 
3.4.1 Different Approaches in Using MDA 
 
There are several ways on how enterprise application developers take advantage of 
modeling. Brown et al. 2005 illustrate this as shown in figure 3.6, showing the spectrum 
of modeling approaches in use by software practitioners today. Each category identifies a 
particular use of models in assisting software practitioners to create running applications 
(code) for a specific runtime platform, and the relationship between the models and the 
code. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Left end of the modeling spectrum in figure 3.6 shows a code-only approach and do not 
use separately defined models at all. Software developers rely almost entirely on the code 
they write, and they express their model of the system they are building directly in a 
third-generation programming language such as Java, C++, or C#. While this approach 
may be adequate for individuals and very small teams, it makes difficult to understand 
key characteristics of the system among the details of the implementation of the business 
logic. Furthermore, it becomes much more difficult to manage the evolution of these 
solutions as their scale and complexity increases, as the system evolves over time, or 
when the original members of the design team are not directly accessible to the team 
maintaining the system (Brown et al., 2005). 
 
An improvement is to provide code visualizations in some appropriate modeling notation. 
As developers create or analyze an application, they often want to visualize the code 
through some graphical notation that aids their understanding of the code's structure or 
behavior. It may also be possible to manipulate the graphical notation as an alternative to 
editing the text-based code, so that the visual rendering becomes a direct representation 
of the code. Such rendering is sometimes called a code model, or an implementation 
model (Brown et al., 2005).

  40 
 
Further modeling advantages are available through round trip engineering (RTE), which 
offers a bi-directional exchange between an abstract model describing the system 
architecture or design, and the code. The developer typically elaborates the system design 
to some level of detail, and then creates a first-pass implementation by applying model-
to-code transformations, usually manually (Brown et al., 2005). 
 
In a model-centric approach, the system models have sufficient detail to enable the 
generation of a full system implementation from the models themselves. To achieve this, 
the models may include, for example, representations of the persistent and non-persistent 
data, business logic, and presentation elements. If there is any integration with legacy 
data and services, the interfaces to those elements may also need to be modeled. The code 
generation process may then apply a series of patterns to transform the models to code 
(Brown et al., 2005).  
 
A model-only approach is at the far-right end of the coding/modeling spectrum shown in 
figure 3.6. In this approach developers use models purely as aids to understand the 
business or solution domain, or for analyzing the architecture of a proposed solution. 
Models are frequently used as the basis for discussion, communication, and analysis 
among teams within a single organization, or across multi-organizational projects. In 
practice, the implementation of a system, whether from scratch or as an update to an 
existing solution, may be disconnected from the models (Brown et al., 2005). 
 
Renaux et al. (2005) state that MDA have several benefits, including the following: 
• Software programmers/engineers read and understand the application logic easier. 
That improves group work which is inherent in all software development projects 
• As application logic is defined independently from a technological context, it is 
not subject to frequent technological changes (causes may be platform evolution, 
economic choices, adoption of technology in fashion) and has a longer life 
expectancy 
 
 
3.4.2 MDA with e-LMS 
 
UML is one among the technologies specified by OMG as a language to enable model 
driven approach. OMG in its UML specification version 1.5, (OMG, 2003b) mentions 
that UML offers a standard way to write a system's blueprints including conceptual 
things. Development of e-LMS will base on model driven architecture using UML as a 
modeling language. Several diagrams will be used to visualize the system for the easy 
understanding and discussion with end-users and research group. Diagrams to be 
involved are ‘use case’ diagrams in requirement and specification phase, ‘conceptual’ 
‘sequence’, ‘collaboration’, ‘design class’ and ‘component’ diagrams in system analysis 
and system design phase. 
 
As stated earlier, MDA is supposed to provide a basic technical framework for 
information integration and tool interoperability based on the separation of platform 
specific models (PSM) from platform independent models (PIM). MDA guide (OMG, 
  41 
 
2003a) points out that MDA is a conceptual framework created by OMG that separates 
business-oriented decisions from platform decisions to allow greater flexibility when 
architecting and evolving software development and deployment. To support these 
principles, the OMG has defined a specific set of layers and transformations that provide 
a conceptual framework and vocabulary of MDA as summarized in figure 3.7. Set of 
layers defined includes computation independent model (CIM), platform independent 
model (PIM) and platform specific model (PSM). Along with conceptual framework, 
OMG through MDA has also provided a set of standards to express models, model 
relationships and model-to-model transformations (OMG, 2003a).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When relating object oriented system analysis and design approach to MDA as shown is 
figure 3.8, CIM for e-LMS will model the system requirement and specifications. UML 
will be used to model the user requirements and their boundaries. The e-LMS has 
considered several users including students, teachers, content administrator, school 
administrators, system administrator, guest user and officers from the concerned 
Ministry, here Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT). CIM also 
shows the e-LMS system architecture and standard specification to be employed. 
 
PIM is related to system analysis and system design stage. UML will model e-LMS at 
different viewpoint levels of abstractions from the platform independent viewpoint. This 
model will give what is being expected to be provided by e-LMS to Tanzanian secondary 
schools.  At this stage, the structure of the e-LMS database through design class diagram 
can be used to select the open source LMS platform. The model of that platform will

enable implementation of a system with desired qualities and will promote the nature of 
mapping towards PSM. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The e-LMS is a Web based platform in order to carter for wide access to a big number of 
rural secondary schools in different regions of Tanzania. The functionality specified in 
the PIM will be realized in a PSM through the application of some transformation. The 
transformation from PIM into PSM will be to express the UML into XML Metadata 
Interchange (XMI) using standard definitions expressed as XML Schema Definitions 
(XSD) as shown in figure 3.9.  
 
XMI is an application of Extensible Markup Language (XML), which lends itself to 
transporting information that is highly internally referential. XMI is applied to transport 
UML models by generating a special XSD through applying the rules of XMI to the 
concrete UML metamodel. The general mechanism applied within OMG to transport 
meta-information is XMI (OMG, 2003a).

3.5 CUSTOMIZATION OF OPEN SOURCE LMS PLATFORM 
 
Learning Management Systems (LMS) are specialized Learning Technology Systems 
based on the state-of-the-art Internet and WWW technologies in order to provide 
education and training following the open and distance learning paradigm (IEEE LTSC, 
2001a; IEEE LTSC, 2001b). Moore et al. (1996) and Carlson (1998) argue that the design 
and implementation of such systems is not an easy task since they are complex systems 
that incorporate a variety of organizational, administrative, instructional and 
technological components. 
 
LMS that are in use today are either commercial products (e.g. WebCT, Blackboard), or 
free open source products (e.g. moodle, claroline), or customized software systems that 
serve the instructional purposes of particular organizations. LMS that belong to the third 
category are exponentially increasing, as most education and training institutions are 
building or planning to build their own LMS. This is due to the fact that a customized 
LMS will fit better their specific learning purposes, and proves to give a good return of 
investment over the years (Collier, 2002).  
 
It is obvious that Tanzanian secondary schools can not afford the cost of commercial 
learning management systems, as well as get hold of a system optionally fitted in the 
specific context. Further more many free open source LMS are designed to suite higher 
institutions while we are developing e-LMS for lower level of secondary schools. The 
alternative means is to customize open source LMS. To ease e-LMS development process 
and to help generate a timely solution, existing open source LMS platforms will be used. 
Most open source LMS could support the basic functions we need in developing e-LMS, 
but there was an obvious need for detailed customization. 
 
 
3.5.1 Significance of the Open Source Software 
 
Open source software (OSS) can be defined as software that is free in terms of its source 
code being available, as well as free in terms of purchase charges, and software licensing 
e-LMS

(OSS Africa, 2005). OSS source code is freely available to individuals to customize 
according to their own needs and distribute provided they abide by the accompanying 
license. This differs from commercial software which may only be obtained by some kind 
of payment; either by purchasing or by leasing. Open source software is based on open 
distribution of the source code that forms the software’s foundations. This means that any 
technically competent programmer can examine the inner working of the source code and 
make changes to the operation of the software. Open source software is typically 
provided free of charge or for a nominal distribution cost. Some open source licenses 
require that any change to the source code be redistributed on the same open source 
license terms as the original source code (Dalziel, 2003). 
 
OSS can be used in educational institutions based on the following advantages:  
• Independence from software vendors  
• Cost savings; saving on paying license fees, but only pay for support and services 
that might be needed  
• Higher reliability; refer to the absence of bugs causing incorrect operations, which 
is a result of the source code being freely available and bugs can be fixed 
immediately (Gbdirect, 2005) 
• Higher stability; Stability is achieved through interchange formats that are often 
quite stable and incompatible file formats not that much of an issue (Gbdirect, 
2005)  
• Better functionality; can be easily modified based on organization context 
• Better performance; OSS is particularly strong in the server and network 
environments, and hence most advantages are geared towards the use of Linux as 
an OSS operating system (OSS Africa, 2005)  
 
 
3.6 e-LMS DATABASE MIRRORING AND REPLICATION 
 
The e-LMS database is for Tanzanian secondary schools’ members (students, teachers 
and school administrators) who are geographically distributed and dispersed in different 
regions. The e-LMS database server will be centrally placed at the University of Dar-es-
Salaam, College of Engineering and Technology. The access of data to the centrally 
placed database is by the means of network connectivity (Internet) which is not very 
reliable due to several reasons like the limited bandwidth and/or electrical breakdowns. 
Amir et al. (2002) reveal that the centralized approach suffers from two major drawbacks: 
• Performance problems due to high server load or high communication latency for 
remote clients 
• Availability problems caused by server downtime or lack of connectivity. Clients 
in portions of the network that are temporarily disconnected from the server 
cannot be serviced 
  
Lack of connectivity due to several reasons like electrical power failure is common and 
the major problem in Tanzania. To increase the availability and accessibility of the 
database, replication of database is of no compromise, and it implements one of the 
specific objectives of this research, that is to enable publication of learning materials. 
  45 
 
Replication is intending to create copies of the database and these copies can be placed to 
individual school or within the cluster of a number of schools for the purpose of easy 
sharing of data from the database, across multiple sites. The main reason for replicating 
in the first place as stated by Thompson (1997) is to enable remote users to continue 
working even if the connection to the central site is down.  
 
To ensure high availability of learning content from the database, replication will also be 
supported by mirroring of the database as shown in figure 3.10 so as to overcome the 
planned and unplanned downtime. Mishra (2006) says that unplanned downtime is 
primarily caused by hardware failure (computer failure and storage failure), disk 
corruption, power outages, communication failures, natural disasters, terrorism, human 
error, and other factors that cause the primary production database, the production server, 
and/or the production data center to be unavailable. Planned downtime is primarily due to 
changes that are applied to the production system. These might be hardware upgrades, 
software upgrades, and database storage and configuration changes, which cause the 
primary database or server to be unavailable for a short period of time. 
 
Thompson’s (1997) analysis found that many of the open source database management 
system (DBMS) by default provides only the limited master to slave (publisher to 
subscriber) replication capabilities and setups. Mirroring and replication involves much 
more than setups. Apart from a thorough understanding of the replication mechanism 
employed by the DBMS to be used by the e-LMS that is MySQL, it also requires careful 
analysis and planning before replication implementation. Thompson (1997) emphasizes 
that all database administration must make sure that the design takes the distributed 
database into account.

3.6.1 Intranet Network in Education 
 
Access through Web browsers mainly Internet Web browsers somehow create doubt on 
reliability due to limited bandwidth and affordability of the Internet in terms of cost to 
many people. Replicating database to local servers can just be one part of solution due to 
reliability as mentioned in e-LMS database mirroring and replication. There are some 
other options which may take care of the problem. Using Intranet network in education 
can be a good option to reduce costs and increase reliability.  As defined by Kuzic et al. 
(2006) Intranet is a computer network, based on Internet technology that is designed to 
meet the internal needs for sharing information within a single organization or company. 
Intranet supports exclusive sharing of information among a prescribed community of 
users - typically members of an organization. Kamthan (1998) argues that Intranets in 
education are most useful to organizations that: are geographically dispersed, share 
common educational views and objective, have common information/communication 
needs, value collaboration and are strongly concerned about their information security 
and privacy. 
 
Kamthan (1998) again mention that there are several advantages in creating an 
educational Intranet, some of them being: 
 
 Cost-Effectiveness 
Intranet tools are inexpensive in initial purchase and deployment. A variety of client and 
servers-side software is almost free for academic or non-commercial use. The Intranet's 
platform-independence usually eliminates the need to create different versions of the 
same application. 
 
 Asynchronous Global Information 
Information can be accessed any time and anywhere, thus overcoming the time and space 
dependent limitations. 
 
 Universal Communication 
With proper authorization, an individual on an Intranet can interact with any other 
individual, and beyond with outside world.  
 
 Security 
Protecting information, even within an educational network, is critical. Intranets are 
protected by a firewall, a network configuration usually created by hardware and 
software that forms a boundary between networked computers within the firewall from 
those outside the firewall. For Internet access, Intranets rely on proxy servers, a special 
server that typically runs in conjunction with a firewall and allows access to the Internet 
from within the firewall. This enables institutions to make only necessary information 
available to the outside world (based on means of privileged access, such as 
username/password-based authentication) thereby avoiding the problems of security 
breach, server overload and access of illegal information. 
 
  47 
 
Marotta (2006) contributes on this by emphasizing that an Intranet typically has three 
features lacking on the Internet: Speed - broad bandwidth, Security - private internal 
network (LAN/WAN), protected from Internet users by a firewall and Control - 
enterprise network management to ensure reliability. 
 
 
3.7 RELATED WORKS 
 
1) “Apply Object-Orientation and UML to the Development of Web-based Learning 
System” by Choe Sun Yong and Zhiming Liu is the report showing how object-
oriented techniques and UML can be used in modeling and development of a Web-
based learning system (Yong et al., 2003). This report was published by UNU/IIST in 
2003. UNU/IIST is located in Macau, China. It is one of the Research and Training 
Centres of the United Nations University, part of the United Nations. It started 
operations in July 1992. UNU/IIST is jointly funded by the Governor of Macau and 
the governments of the People's Republic of China and Portugal. The mission of 
UNU/IIST is to assist developing countries in the application and development of 
software technology. Yong et al. (2003) in their report, consider how object-oriented 
techniques and UML through the requirement capture and analysis, design, and 
implementation can be used in the development of a Web-based learning system. As 
the starting cycle in the Rational Development Process (RDP) of the whole system, 
they carried out the requirement analysis and design of the sub-system that is only 
concerned with Web-based learning in computer science as a case study. The 
structure of the database obtained was the design class diagram. 
 
Steps of designing a system in this document include: 
• Providing goals for the system to be developed 
• Stating functions that a system is supposed to do 
• Creation of use case and use case diagrams 
• Creation of a system conceptual diagram 
• Creation of system sequence diagrams and identifying system operations 
• Creation of contracts for system operations 
• Creation of interactive diagrams (sequence and collaboration) 
• Creation of a design class diagram 
• Mapping a design to code 
 
2) “Unified Modeling Language Guide Version 0.2.1 May 13, 2001” in the URL 
http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/uml/begin/ (Basic UML Guide, 2001) is 
the document which addresses steps involved in the design process of a project. The 
UML design process as explained in this document involves the creation of various 
graphical or text based documents. In UML, these documents are called artifacts and 
they describe the output of a step in the process. The UML design process has two 
main parts which are:  
• Analysis - What is the problem?  
• Design - How should the problem be solved?  
 
  48 
 
The reason for this analysis and design process is to allow the project to be broken 
down into component parts. Artifacts (Documents) created are as shown in table 3.1 
(normally in the order shown). 
 
Table 3.1: Artifacts for Analysis and Design Phases

• System Sequence Diagram  
• Domain Model (formally called conceptual model)  
• Operation Contract

• Collaboration Diagram (Also called interaction diagrams)  
• Design Class Diagrams 
 
Both above documents explain clearly steps on design process using object orientation 
and UML. Implementation in an object-oriented programming language requires writing 
source code class definitions and method definition based on design class diagrams. It is 
basically required to define classes with methods and simple attributes, add reference 
attributes, and define methods from collaboration diagrams. 
 
In the course of our research, the design class diagrams reached by the two above referred 
documents are platform independent model (PIM) as applied in MDA. The actual design 
class diagram to be implemented hereby known as Platform Specific Model (PSM) from 
MDA will be reached after being transformed as stated earlier. The research is trying to 
closely relate object oriented system analysis and system design approach and MDA in 
both cases using UML. 
 
 
3.8 DISCUSSION 
 
Software design approach is applied simply to produce a software solution to a problem. 
To produce quality software, we need to thoroughly understand the requirements that 
satisfy the users' needs. Visualization in the course of continuous improvement is a 
necessary basis for the participation of the personnel, and allows end-users to grasp the 
concept of operations of the system without having to understand software terminologies. 
 
A model is used for understanding a system behavior properly before its actual 
implementation. Integration of the power of models as emphasized by OMG with 
software development lifecycle stages promotes description of a system from different 
viewpoints, each focusing on particular concerns. A viewpoint, applied to a system, gives 
a view of that system. Customization of open source LMS platforms can be used to 
develop a system which is optionally fitted in the specific context. 
 
The coming chapter discusses the Web technologies in theoretical point of view and 
gives the practical application of it by designing e-bookstore database.

4. WEB BASED TECHNOLOGIES 
 
 
4.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can be defined in many ways 
depending on the ICT area of application concerned. Generally, ICT covers any product 
that will store, retrieve, manipulate, transmit or receive information electronically in a 
digital form. Apart from the above concern of ICT, importantly is also the way these 
different uses can work with each other. 
 
This chapter gives a theoretical review of Web based technologies. It also shows how 
theory can easily be understood when “learning by doing” technique is employed through 
designing a Web based database system. Here online e-bookstore shop was developed for 
this purpose.  
 
 
4.2 THEORETICAL REVIEW 
 
The World Wide Web (WWW or Web in short) provides a simple ‘point and click’ 
means of exploring the immense volume of pages of information residing on the Internet 
(Connolly et al., 2005). Information on Web is presented on Web pages, which appear as 
a collection of text, graphics, pictures, sound and video. In addition, a Web page can 
contain hyperlinks to other Web pages. Much of the Web’s success is due to (Connolly et 
al., 2005): 
• The simplicity with which it allows users to provide, use and refer to information 
distributed geographically around the world 
• Providing users with the ability to browse multimedia documents independently 
not based on the type/make of the computer hardware being used 
• Compatibility with other existing data communication protocols such as File 
Transfer Protocol (FTP) 
 
Connolly et al. (2005) explain that the Web consists of computers that can act in two 
roles: as servers for providing information such as Apache server; and as clients, usually 
referred to as browsers for requesting information such as Internet Explorer (IE).  
 
The theoretical review of the Web base technologies studied include HTML, XHTML, 
CSS,  Java Scripting language and PHP server side scripting language. There are much 
more in this to be covered like MySQL Database engine, XML and WAMP (Windows, 
Apache, MySQL and PHP) windows local server.  
 
 
4.2.1 HTML, XHTML, CSS 
 
Connolly et al. (2005) state that HTML is a system for making up, or tagging a document 
so that it can be published on the Web. HTML defines what is generally transmitted 
  50 
 
between nodes in the network. It is a simple, yet powerful, platform-independent 
document language. As stated by Shannon (2007) HTML is a computer language devised 
to allow Web site creation. These Web sites can then be viewed by anyone else connected 
to the Internet. The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language (Shannon, 
2007): 
 HyperText is the method by which you move around on the Web — by clicking on 
special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is 
hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet 
whenever you want by clicking on links  
 Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type 
of text (for example ‘italicized text’) 
 HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language 
 
HTML was originally developed by Tim Berners-Lee and was standardized in November 
1995. The language has evolved and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) 
recommended the use of HTML4.01, which has mechanisms for frames, style sheets, 
scripting and embedded objects.  
 
W3C defines XHTML as the latest version of HTML 4.01.  XHTML will gradually 
replace HTML. In early 2000, W3C produced XHTML 1.0 as a reformulation of HTML 
4 in XML (Connolly et al., 2005). Gowans (2001) says that XHTML stands for 
Extensible Hypertext Markup Language and is a bridge between HTML and XML. 
XHTML was created for two main reasons: 
• To create a stricter standard for making Web pages, reducing incompatibilities 
between browsers  
• To create a standard that can be used on a variety of different devices without 
changes  
 
Evjen et al. (2007) reveal that one of the major changes to HTML which was introduced 
to XHTML is that tags must always be properly formed. With the HTML specification 
you could be very sloppy in your coding with missing tags and incorrect formation 
without many problems, but in XHTML this is very important. The biggest change in 
XHTML is the way in which you write them. Tags and formats must be correct. The 
main changes to the HTML tags in XHTML are; tags must always be in lower case, they 
must all be properly formed, properly nested, must have document type and all tags in 
XHTML must be closed (Gowans, 2001).  
 
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. A style defines how an HTML element is 
displayed. Style sheet refers to the document itself. Cascade is the special part. A Web 
style sheet is intended to cascade through a series of style sheets (Kyrnin, 1997). Rotter et 
al. (2000) tell that HTML allows designers to determine how a document is viewed in a 
browser over the World Wide Web by applying tags that manipulate the appearance or 
assign styles to the text. The purpose of cascading style sheets (CSS) is to allow Web 
authors to manipulate a Web page's appearance without affecting its HTML structure. 
Style information can be stored in the header of a given HTML page (Internal Style), 
  51 
 
within a given tag (Inline style) and in a separate file which is then linked to the HTML 
page by a reference in the page header (External style) (Kyrnin, 1997).  
 
Nielsen (1997) defines CSS as an elegantly designed extension to the Web and one of the 
greatest hopes for recapturing the Web's ideal of separation of presentation and content. 
Kyrnin (1997) notices that CSS is used to style Web pages, but there is more to it than 
that, CSS are used to style XHTML and XML markup. This means that anywhere you 
have XML markup (including XHTML) you can use CSS to define how it will look like. 
CSS is also used to define how Web pages should look like when viewed in other media 
than a Web browser. For example, you can create a print style sheet that will define how 
the Web page should be printed out and another style sheet to display the Web page on a 
projector for a slide show (Kyrnin, 1997).  
 
 
4.2.2 Web Sites 
 
A Web site is a collection of documents written in the HTML language. When a user 
looks at a Web site with a browser (e.g. Netscape, Internet Explorer (IE), Mozilla 
Firefox, etc), the browser is able to follow the instructions presented to it in HTML to 
make a Web site appear in a certain way. A Web site can either be a static Web site or a 
dynamic Web site. 
 
 Static Web Site 
Connolly et al. (2005) explain that an HTML document stored in a file is an example of a 
static Web page. The content of the document does not change unless it is changed, that 
is, if the user were to reload a static Web site, they would see the exact same content 
every time. Static Web site contents are written directly by an author, and when the user 
goes through the site, that code is downloaded into a browser and interpreted.  
 
 Dynamic Web Site 
In contrast to a static Web site, a dynamic Web site is the one whose content is 
regenerated every time a user visits or reloads the site. Connolly et al. (2005) comment 
that a dynamic Web page is generated each time it is accessed. As a database is dynamic, 
contents are changing as a user creates, inserts, updates and deletes data. Generating 
dynamic Web pages is much more appropriate approach than creating static ones. This 
method is gaining popularity as the technology to generate Web pages instantly from a 
database query. A dynamic Web page is stored on the Web server with no actual data but 
instead a template for the HTML code and a query. When a client accesses the page, the 
query is executed, and an HTML page containing the data is generated. There are a 
variety of languages available to make a dynamic Web site, one of them is PHP: 
Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP).  
 
 
 
 
 
  52 
 
4.2.3 Scripting Languages 
 
Scripting languages are becoming increasingly popular on the Web, because they can be 
used to make Web pages more dynamic and interactive. As described by Connolly et al. 
(2005), scripting languages: are interpreted directly from the source code and permit 
scripting within an HTML document, allow the creation of functions embedded within 
HTML code, may be executed within the browser or at the server before the document is 
sent to the browser and allow various processes to be automated and objects to be 
accessed and manipulated. Programs can be written with standard programming logic 
such as loops, conditional statements and mathematical operations.  
 
There are two types of scripting languages: client-side and server-side (AccessIT, 2002).  
 Client-side scripting is scripting that does all of its processing on the users own 
computer. It is commonly used to create pop-up windows, instant-redirect pulldown 
menus, shopping-cart calculations, and mouseover effects (i.e., menus or images that 
change when the user's mouse passes over them). JavaScript is the most popular 
client-side scripting language. 
 In contrast, Server-side scripting performs all of its processing on the Web server and 
delivers a final product (the Web page) to the user's browser. Server-side scripting 
does not, in and of itself, present accessibility problems. Like all Web content, 
however, server-side scripts must produce content that follows principles of 
accessible design. Server-side scripting language integrates databases into the Web 
environment. PHP is the most popular server-side scripting language. 
 
The construction for both client-side and server-side scripting languages are the same, 
except the server side has additional functionality. 
 
 
i. Java Scripting Language 
 
By definition, JavaScript is a client-side scripting language. This means the Web surfer's 
browser will be running the script. JavaScript has been around for several years now, in 
many different flavors. JavaScript was created by Netscape for their Navigator 2.x (late 
1995). JavaScript was specifically designed to work together with HTML (and XHTML) 
to create more dynamic Web pages (Connolly et al., 2005). 
 
JavaScript allows HTML pages to include functions and scripts that can recognize and 
respond to user events such as mouse click, user input and page navigation. There are 
many uses for the powerful JavaScript language. Mentioning few things are Mouse 
Trailers (an animation that follows your mouse when you surf a site), Drop Down Menus, 
Alert Messages, Popup Windows, HTML Form Data Validation etc. 
 
JavaScript is certainly the most popular scripting language for Web documents, but it 
isn't the only one. Other scripting languages are AppleScript, Visual Basic Scripting 
(VBScript), and languages such as UNIX’s shell scripting languages. Visual Basic 
Scripting (VBScript) runs a distant, but occasionally significant, second place in the Web 
  53 
 
scripting world, despite the fact that it's a Microsoft-only technology that's only supported 
in Internet Explorer for Windows. VBScript, Microsoft's Visual Basic Scripting Edition, 
is a scaled down version of Visual Basic for use with Web pages and other applications 
that uses Microsoft Active X controls. VBScript is very similar in use and syntax to 
JavaScript except it is based on a subset of Microsoft's Visual Basic (VB) language. 
While it doesn't offer the functionality of Visual Basic, it does provide a powerful, easy 
to learn tool that can be used to add interaction to Web pages (Peters, 2005).  
 
Though, JavaScript and VBScript are both popular scripting languages for Web browser 
applications, JavaScript will be applied in this thesis due to the following advantages 
(Peters, 2005; WEB/420 Team C, 2004) over VBScript: 
• JavaScript is the default scripting language for browsers but VBScript must be 
specified as the scripting language 
• JavaScript has cross-platform support from all popular browsers while VBScript 
is supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer only; other browsers may not run the 
script 
• JavaScript is case sensitive but VBScript is not this would not be prone to as 
many syntax errors 
• JavaScript is supported widely on both the server and client sides, but VBScript is 
for server side only, with only IE for client side 
 
Considering security to JavaScript, care was taken to build some security features into 
JavaScript. For example client-side JavaScript cannot access network resources or write 
to file systems. In theory, downloaded scripts are run by default in a restricted 'sandbox' 
environment that isolates them from the rest of the operating system. Scripts are 
permitted access only to data in the current document or closely related documents 
(generally those from the same site as the current document). No access is granted to the 
local file system, the memory space of other running programs, or the operating system’s 
networking layer (Peters, 2005).  
 
 
ii. PHP Server Scripting Language 
 
Online Web site (2008) writes that there are four popular scripting languages: PHP, Perl, 
Active Server Page (ASP) and Java Server Pages (JSP) used to write server side scripts.  
ASP is for windows programming background. If ASP is used, windows hosting package 
should be chosen. ASP is primarily a Windows technology, but with limited support on 
other platforms. Perl is being replaced by PHP and so is not a consideration and JSP is a 
Java-based system for embedding Java-related code in HTML pages. JSP is the preserve 
of large corporates and it is not the choice of small/medium Web site designers. PHP is 
supported on both Microsoft and Linux Web servers and will be applied in this e-LMS 
system development. 
 
PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language. 
Connolly et al. (2005) state that PHP is a popular open source HTML-embedded scripting 
language, which is supported by many Web servers including Apache hypertext transfer 
  54 
 
protocol (HTTP) Server and is the preferred Linux Web scripting language. When you 
create a static Web page, you simply write HTML code. Writing a dynamic page with 
PHP is similar, except you embed the PHP code inside HTML code. For this reason, PHP 
is called an HTML-embedded scripting language. The goal of the language is to allow 
Web developers to write dynamically-generated pages quickly. One of the advantages of 
PHP is its extensibility. More advantages of PHP are: 
• PHP is available at no cost  
• PHP is FREE to download from the official PHP resource: www.php.net  
• PHP is a Free Software so you have the Freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, 
change and improve it 
• PHP offers cross-platform compatibility. In other words, it will not matter what 
platform (Microsoft Windows, or a version of Unix/Linux) users are running, 
since there is no need for any additional software in order to see PHP's dynamic 
content. This is because the dynamic content is processed on the server side, and 
then sent as if it was static  
• PHP is compatible with almost all servers used today (Apache, 10IIS, etc.)  
• PHP is easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side  
 
A popular choice nowadays is to use the open source combinations of Apache HTTP 
Server, PHP, and one of the database systems MySQL. PHP runs on the server side, 
which means that the Web server that sends an HTML file to a user's browser, will carry 
out the instructions found in the embedded PHP code first, and then send the output of 
the PHP code along with the HTML code. The results are the Web pages with dynamic 
content.  
 
 
4.2.4 MySQL Database Engine 
 
The database system as it has been explained by Riordan (2005) describes all the 
components, all the software and the data that goes into making a production system. 
These components include the application, the database, the database engine and the 
middleware. MySQL is a database engine at the lowest level. A database engine defines a 
structure for storing information. In a database, there are tables containing rows, columns, 
and cells. Databases are useful when storing information categorically.  
 
Russell (2005) mention that there are many features contribute to MySQL's standing as a 
superb database system. Its speed is one of its most prominent features. In a comparison 
to several other databases (Oracle, 11MS SQL, 12IBM DB2, and Sybase 13ASE), MySQL 
and Oracle tied for best performance and for greatest scalability. For a database long 
dismissed by many people, MySQL is remarkably scalable, and is able to handle tens of 
thousands of tables and billions of rows of data. Plus, it manages small amounts of data 
quickly and smoothly. 
                                                 
10 IIS - Internet Information Server 
11 MS - Microsoft 
12 IBM – International Business Machines 
13 ASE – Adaptive Server Enterprise 
  55 
 
Gilmore (2004) also gives a number of features that makes MySQL so popular. High 
performance is the major concern which is built by very specific optimization of the 
following features: 
 
 Multiple table handler; MySQL offers three table handlers for managing data. Each of 
these table handlers, HEAP, InnoDB and MyISAM bears its own strengths and 
weaknesses.  
 
Each table has its advantages and disadvantages. As it has been emphasized by 
Gilmore (2005), InnoDB is a robust transactional table handler. InnoDB offer users a 
powerful solution for working with very large data stores. It is a complete database 
back end unto itself. 
 
 Query caching; MySQL enhances the greatest speed by allowing query caching. 
MySQL will store SELECT queries, along with their corresponding results. As 
subsequent queries are executed, MySQL will compare them against the cached 
queries. 
 
 Full-Text Indexing and searching; this feature greatly enhances the performance of 
mining data from text-based columns. This feature also enables producing results in 
order of relevance in accordance with how closely the query matches the row.  
 
 Replication; replication allows for a database located within one MySQL server to be 
duplicated on another, which provides a great number of advantages, e.g. replication 
greatly increase availability, provides a means of backing up a database. 
 
MySQL comes with quite a few utilities, or clients, each of which provides interfaces for 
carrying out various tasks pertinent to server administration. “mysql” client is an 
extremely useful SQL shell, capable of managing almost every conceivable aspect of a 
MySQL server. This includes creating, modifying and deleting tables and databases, 
setting user access privileges, viewing and modifying the server configuration, and 
querying table data (Gilmore, 2004). 
 
The “phpMyAdmin” being another MySQL client is a Web-based, third-party client 
program, MySQL administration written in PHP. It is not only very stable, but it offers a 
number of compiling features (Gilmore, 2004): 
• It is a browser-based allowing easy management of remote MySQL databases 
from anywhere you have access to the Web 
• Administrators can exercise complete control over user privileges, passwords and 
resource usage, as well as create, delete and even copy user accounts 
 
 
4.2.5 Extensible Markup Language (XML) 
 
XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. XML is a markup language very similar 
and related to HTML, but HTML is used to mark up text for presentation purposes where 
  56 
 
as XML is used to mark up text for data representation purposes (Evjen et al., 2007). 
XML was designed to describe data. XML tags are not pre-defined you must define your 
own tags. XML uses a Document Type Definition (DTD) or an XML Schema to describe 
the data. XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be self-descriptive. XML is a 
W3C Recommendation. Connolly et al. (2005) define an XML to be a meta-language (a 
language for describing other languages) that enables designers to create their own 
customized tags to provide functionality not available with HTML.  
 
Evjen et al. (2007) explain that XML has distinct advantages, thus making it as popular 
as it is today. These advantages are: 
• XML is easy to read and understand 
• A large number of platforms support XML and are able to manage it through an 
even larger set of tools available for XML data reading, writing and manipulation 
• XML can be used across open standards that are available today 
• XML allows developers to create their own data definitions and models of 
representation 
• XML is simpler to use than binary formats when you want to represent complex 
data structures 
 
 
4.2.6 Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP (WAMP) 
 
WAMP is an acronym for Windows, Apache, MySQL and one or more of Perl, PHP and 
Python. It was modeled after the more well-known LAMP, referring to the all-open 
source/free software approach which uses Linux instead of Windows. Each element of 
the WAMP acronym provides an essential layer of functionality: 
• Microsoft Windows is the operating system 
• Apache is the Web server 
• MySQL is the DBMS (database management system or database server) 
• PHP is an object-oriented Web scripting language 
• Perl is a powerful, general-purpose, object-oriented scripting language 
• Python is yet another powerful, general-purpose, object-oriented scripting 
language  
 
 
4.2.7 Database Security 
 
As the use of the Web grows on both Intranets and the public Internet, information 
security is becoming crucial. The Web provides a convenient, cheap, and instantaneous 
way of publishing data. With many systems implementing dynamic creation of Web 
pages from a database, corporate information security is even more vital, since anyone 
with a Web browser can view data in a database that is not properly protected. For Web 
security, there are three primary areas to address (Rahmel, 1997):  
 
 Server security -- ensuring security relating to the actual data or private HTML files 
stored on the server. It involves limiting access to data stored on the server. The 
  57 
 
process of publishing data to the Web often requires information systems specialists 
implementing the security policy. 
 
 User-authentication security -- ensuring login security that prevents unauthorized 
access to information. Authentication security governs the barrier that must be passed 
before the user can access particular information. The user must have some valid 
form of identification before access is granted. Logins are accomplished in two 
standard ways: using an HTML form or using an HTTP security request. This method 
has the advantage of letting the Database Administrator (DBA) define a particular 
user's privilege. By using a table created by the DBA, numerous security privileges 
specific to a particular project can be defined. 
 
 Session security -- ensuring that data is not intercepted as it is broadcasted over the 
Internet or Intranet. After the user has supplied proper identification and access is 
granted to data, session security ensures that private data is not intercepted or 
interfered with during the session. It involves encrypting all of the information that 
flows both ways. 
 
 
4.2.7.1. Computer-Based Security Controls 
 
Data is a valuable resource that must be strictly controlled and managed. The term 
security refers to the protection of the database against unauthorized access, either 
intentional or accidental. Database security is concerned with avoiding: theft and frauds, 
loss of confidentiality (secrecy), loss of privacy, loss of integrity and loss of availability. 
Security considerations apply not only to the data held in database, but also to hardware, 
software and people. Connolly (2005) clearly says that the type of countermeasure to 
threats on computer systems range from physical controls to administrative procedures. 
He continues by describing computer-based security controls for a multi-user 
environment to be:  
 
 Authorization 
Authorization means the granting of a right or privilege that enables a subject to have 
legitimate access to a system or a system’s object. The process of authorization involves 
authentication (that is mechanism that determines whether a user is who he or she claims 
to be) of subjects requesting access to objects, where ‘subject’ represents a user or 
program and ‘object’ represents a database table. A system administrator is usually 
responsible for allowing users to have access to a computer system by creating individual 
user account (unique identification and a password). This is done along with giving a user 
the right to use the DBMS. 
 
 Access Control 
The typical way to provide access control for a database system is based on the granting 
and revoking of privileges. A privilege allows a user to create or access (that is read, 
write or modify) some database objects (such as relation, view or index) or to run certain 
  58 
 
DBMS utilities. Privileges are granted to users to accomplish the tasks required for their 
jobs. 
 
 Views  
A view is the dynamic result of one or more relational operations operating on the base 
relations to produce another relation. A view is a virtual relation that does not actually 
exist in the database, but is produced upon request by a particular user, at the time of 
request. The view mechanism provides a powerful and flexible security mechanism by 
hiding parts of the database from certain users. The user is not aware of the existence of 
any attributes or rows that are missing from the view. A view can be defined over several 
relations with the user be granted the appropriate privilege to use it, but not to use the 
base relations. In this way, using a view is more restrictive than simply having certain 
privileges granted to a user on the base relation(s). 
 
 Backups and Recovery  
Backup is a process of periodically taking a copy of the database and log file (and 
possibly programs) on to offline storage media. A DBMS should provide backup 
facilities to assist with the recovery of a database following failures. A DBMS should 
provide logging facilities, sometimes referred to as journaling, which keeps track of the 
current state of transactions and database changes, to provide support for recovery 
procedures. 
 
 Integrity 
Integrity constraints ensure that the data is accurate. For example, relational integrity 
constraints are: entity integrity (in a base relation, no attribute of a primary key can be 
null), referential integrity (If a foreign key exists in a relation, either the foreign key value 
must match a candidate key value of some tipple in its home relation or the foreign key 
value must be wholly null). Integrity constrain also contributes to maintaining a secure 
database system by preventing data from becoming invalid, and hence giving misleading 
or incorrect results. 
 
 Encryption  
This is the encoding of the data by a special algorithm that renders the data unreadable by 
any program without the decryption key. Some DBMS provide an encryption facility for 
this purpose. 
 
 Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID)  
The hardware that the DBMS is running on must be fault-tolerant, meaning that the 
DBMS should continue to operate even if one of the hardware components fails. This 
suggests having redundant components that can be seamlessly integrated into the working 
system whenever there is one or more component failure. The main hardware 
components that should be fault-tolerant include disk drives, disk controllers, central 
processing unit (CPU), power supplies and cooling fans. 
 
 
 
  59 
 
4.2.7.2. DBMS and Web Security 
 
Internet communication protocol relies on TCP/IP as the underlying protocol. However 
TCP/IP and HTTP were not designed with security in mind. With a three-tier architecture 
that is popular in a Web environment, we have the complexity of ensuring secure access 
to, and from, the database. The security of such architecture requires different products 
and mechanisms (Connolly, 2005). Some of the issues associated with database security 
in Web environment are: 
 
 Proxy Servers 
A proxy server is a computer that sits between a Web browser and a Web server. The two 
main purposes of a proxy server are to improve performance and filter requests. A proxy 
server saves the results of all the requests for a certain amount of time. It can significantly 
improve performance by simply returning the requested Web page from the cached page 
that it had already fetched. A proxy server can also be set to prevent users from accessing 
a specific set of Web sites. 
 
 Firewalls  
A firewall is a system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private 
network. 
 
 
4.3 WEB BASED TECHNOLOGIES ON ONLINE e-BOOKSTORE SYSTEM 
DESIGN 
 
The goal of this exercise was to create the base for understanding Web based technology 
in a practical perspective way. The motive to this is that the e-LMS to be developed will 
be a Web based system and it will need the application of this knowledge.  The exercise 
was to develop an e-commerce site for a bookstore with PHP, MySQL, XHTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and Apache as the Web server. In this exercise, the concentration was on how 
to display and show information about books. Concerning the database, it was given that; 
every book should belong to a category such as science fiction, thriller and/or history. 
The data about each book should be at least International Standard Book Number (ISBN), 
title, publisher and author. Additional data could be the URL to the publisher, picture and 
perhaps reviews. 
 
Concerning the interface, it was suggested to have a look at existing Web based book 
stores such as Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/), Barnes & Nobles 
(http://www.barnesandnoble.com/) etc and use them as inspirations. Online book store 
was designed using Windows, Apache, MySQL and PHP (WAMP) local server. 
 
 
4.3.1 Main Objective 
 
The main objective of this design exercise was to get the touch of designing Web-Based 
platforms and to learn basics in designing Web-based databases. Along side with this, 
  60 
 
was to learn useful technologies applied in Web based platforms in a practical aspect 
view. These technologies include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Extensible 
Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML), XHTML Document Type Definition (DTD), 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a Web side JavaScript Language, server side PHP: 
Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) scripting language, here PHP 5 was studied, MySQL 
Database Server and Apache application server. All these knowledge are useful in 
developing an interactive e-Learning Management System (e-LMS) for Tanzanian 
secondary schools to be done in my PhD research. 
 
 
4.3.2 Material Requirements 
 
To be able to do online bookstore, the followings were needed; the theoretical and 
practical knowledge of the technologies mentioned in section 4.2 above; Linux, the 
operating system; Apache, the Web server; MySQL, the database management system 
(DBMS) or database server; PHP scripting language and a personal computer having 
windows 2000 operating system or above. For convenience, WAMP for Microsoft 
windows was used. WAMP is an open source package for windows combining Apache, 
MySQL and one or more of Perl, PHP and Python. It is a form of mini-server that can run 
on almost any Windows Operating System. 
 
Together with reference books on PHP, MySQL and other Web technologies, the 
theoretical and practical knowledge of the technologies I wanted was also obtained from 
the URL http://www.w3school.com. 
 
 
4.3.3 e-Bookstore System Requirement and Analysis 
 
The design started by identifying users/stakeholders to be involved in the e-bookstore 
system and their action boundaries towards the use of the system. The following 
minimum numbers of users were identified and summarized in use case diagram, figure 
4.1: 
 System Administrator; is the one who will be responsible in administering the system 
as a whole. He will be responsible in : 
• Uploading important information about the book. These information include: 
book title, author name/s, publisher name, ISBN etc 
• Creating and editing functional components of the system e.g. user interface 
pages 
• Manage users and their event log-in 
• Publishing selected important book information to the public 
• Maintain the system 
 Customer/visitor; represents any person who visits the e-bookstore home page and 
wants to view any information about books. This person can also be the one who will 
be interested in purchasing/ordering books from the bookstore. A visitor can be 
registered as a customer upon submission of needed information.  The system will 
provide the following privileges to the customer/visitor: 
  61 
 
• Be able to view important information about the book provided to the public as a 
visitor 
• Be able to perform self registration as a customer after providing needed 
information 
• Be able to request for extra information about purchasing/ordering books 
• Be able to purchase/order books online after meeting provided requirements for 
purchasing/ordering books 
 Reviewer; represents the one who will be interested to give views on the book s/he 
read. The system will provide the following privileges to the reviewer: 
• Be able to perform self registration as a reviewer after providing needed 
information 
• Be able to write reviews on a certain book and send to the system 
• Be able to receive responds about the review sent 
• Be able to view important information about the book provided to the public 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.3.4 e-Bookstore System Architecture 
 
Online bookstores are intended to be viewed and used by many people world wide. In 
this case the technique of designing a three-tier architecture for Web based systems was 
Upload/Publish Books

System Maintenance
Self Registration
Request for More

Write/Send Views
Manage Users

  62 
 
employed. Three-tier architecture organizes a distributed client-server systems in a 
flexible manner.  
 
Using a WAMP installed into a personal computer window, it was easy to get the needed 
software for the system all together. MySQL database server that stores data, the apache 
application server that controls the communication (basic system functionalities) and 
PHP which comes together in a single package i.e. WAMP. This means that the server 
was viewed as a local host within the same computer. Figure 4.2 shows the e-bookstore 
architecture within the computer windows. All three components for a three-tier 
architecture were implemented. These components are: 
 
 The client component was used to provide the user interface for the Web-based 
application. It is a front-end layer. Using a standard Web browser of the computer, 
which support XHTML, JavaScript, and CSS Web technologies, the user will access 
database through the Web server. The access to the local server was made possible 
through using created user interface Web pages. In this case the same personal 
computer was used as a client. 
 
 The application server (Apache) is responsible for interacting with the client and the 
database server (MySQL). It receives and processes the data from the client requests, 
retrieves information (data) from database if needed; it also generates a client 
response and stores the necessary data into database. Apache Web server running in 
windows operating system and a server side script language to be used is PHP are all 
included in WAMP package. They will both be used to connect to the back-end 
(MySQL database). 
 
 The database server (MySQL) is the place where data are being stored. The database 
server maintains the data needed for the Web application.  It is a back-end layer. It 
stores data and controls the basic system functionality. MySQL database server is 
also included in WAMP installed in computer windows.

4.3.5 Database Structure, Tables and ERD 
 
Table creation started by thinking on important information which is being used to 
identify a book. The minimum information considered to identify a book with reference 
to the time limit of two months to develop e-bookstore was as follows: 
• Title to represent the title of the book 
• Author to represent the information of the author/s  
• ISBN to represent the unique identification of a book 
• Publisher to represent the information about the publisher 
• Publisher URL to represents the URL of the publisher 
• Category to represent the subject under which the book falls into 
• Reviews to represent reviews for the book given by the reviewer 
• Book page numbers to represent how many pages the book has 
• Book price to represent the price of the book 
• Book description to represent the abstract of the book 
 
Considering normalization, which is the process of removing redundancy data from 
tables and improving storage efficiency, data integrity and scalability, the following 
tables were created: 
• “Book” table 
• “Publisher” table 
• “Category” table 
• “Author” table 
• “Review” table 
• “Customer” table 
• “Sales” table as an intermediate table to link “book” and “customer” tables 
 
Attributes for each table was identified followed by the identification of primary keys and 
foreign keys to make one-to-many relationship. Foreign keys are columns in a table that 
refers to primary keys from another table. This serves the purpose of defining data 
relationships. Table 4.1 shows “book” table with attributes as one example of the tables 
created. 
 
Table 4.1: Book Table and Attributes 
**isbn title *authorid *publisherid *categoryid price currency *reviewerid publishyear toc 
          
** Primary key for book table * Foreign keys from corresponding tables 
 
 
4.3.6 Database and Tables Creation in WAMP 
 
Next step was to create database and tables in MySQL database engine. Database and 
tables were created by the help of a “mysql” command-line client as a powerful means 
for working with the server, and also by the help of a phpMyAdmin client, a third-party 
  64 
 
client program. The database created was named “bookstore” and the command used in 
command-line is:  
mysql> create database bookstore;  
 
With “bookstore” database the above mentioned tables of type InnoDB were created 
within the “bookstore” database with the help of a command-line. Taking a “book” table 
as one example, below is a code for creating “book” table: 
 
mysql >CREATE TABLE book ( 
> isbn CHAR (18) NOT NULL, 
> title CHAR (50) NOT NULL, 
>authorname CHAR (120) NOT NULL, 
> publishername CHAR (40) NOT NULL, 
> categoryname CHAR (200) NOT NULL, 
> price DECIMAL NOT NULL, 
> currency CHAR (5) NOT NULL, 
> revieweremail CHAR (30) NOT NULL, 
> publishyear YEAR (4) NOT NULL, 
> toc TEXT, 
> PRIMARY KEY (isbn), 
> INDEX (authorname),  
   FOREIN KEY (authorname) REFERENCES author (authorname) ON  
   UPDATE  CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT, 
> INDEX (publishername),  
   FOREIGN KEY (publishername) REFERENCES publisher (publishername)  
   ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT,         
> INDEX (categoryname),  
   FOREIGN KEY (categoryname) REFERENCES category (categoryname)    
    ON  UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT, 
> INDEX (revieweremai),  
   FOREIGN KEY (revieweremai) REFERENCES reviewer (revieweremai) ON  
   UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE RESTRICT); 
 
 
4.3.7 Data Entry Forms 
 
After all tables had been created in a bookstore database, the next step was to develop 
data entry forms which helped to facilitate data entry into created tables. The following 
data entry forms were created based on who is going to use these forms: 
 
 Administrator; Administrator is the one who is responsible in entering all book 
information required. The following forms were created: 
•  Administrator registration form: this form is used to register a person who takes 
responsibilities as an administrator, the overall controller of a database 
• Administrator login form: to allow the assigned administrator to login and have a 
permission to access the database 
• Author data  entry form: used by an administrator to enter information about the 
author of the book 
  65 
 
• Book category data entry form: used to enter category of the book 
• Book description entry form: used to enter description of the book 
• Publisher data entry form: used to enter information about the book publisher 
• Sales data entry form; used to enter information about selling, ordering and 
purchasing books 
 
 Customer: the one who is interested in ordering and purchasing books: 
• Customer registration form: allows a new customer to perform online registration 
so that he/she can be recognized by the company as a customer 
• Customer login form: allows a registered customer to view relevant information 
provided to customers, order and/or purchase books 
 
 Reviewer: the one who provide reviews concerning books/s of his/her interest 
• Book review data entry form: to be used by a reviewer  
 
A registered customer is provided with a customer home page (customer site). This page 
gives a customer more privileges to access more information, for example answers to 
requested information from the administrator. A customer in a customer site can: send e-
mail, edit personal information, order or purchase books and get other privileges provided 
to all visitors.  
 
When administrator logs in, he/she will be forwarded to a page special for administration 
(administrator Site). In this page, administrator will be provided with a number of links to 
different data entry forms for different tables. He/she will also be able to view 
information about books as shown in figure 4.3.  
 
 
4.3.8 Data Queries 
 
A number of queries, as shown below, were created to view different selected 
information about books. These displays are also displayed in the bookstore home page to 
be viewed by all visitors of the page as shown in figure 4.4. 
• Display a list of all books present in book shop 
• Display a list of all books present in book shop category wise 
• Display a list of all books present in book shop by author 
• Display a list of all books present in book shop category wise but in tabular form 
• Display a list of book authors 
• Display relevant book information 
• Display relevant book information in tabular form 
• Display customer list 
• Display book reviews

Below is a sample code written to display book information from the database in tabular 
form. HTML-Kit editor was used to write these codes. The code connects to the database 
engine (MySQL), selects the database to deal with (bookstore), selects needed table fields 
from tables and displays what found in these table fields.  
 
 <?php   
     $linkID = @mysql_connect("localhost" , "root" , "root") 
             or die("Can't connect to database server!!"); 
    @mysql_select_db("bookstore") or die("Can't connect to database server!!");  
Fig. 4.3: Administrator Site 
Fig. 4.4: E-Bookstore Home Page

    $query2 = "SELECT isbn, title, authorname, publishername FROM book"; 
    echo"<p style=\"color: green; margin-top: 1cm; font-size: 120%; font-eight:bold;\">List  
                          of Books in Tabular Form:</p>"; 
    $result2 = mysql_query($query2) or die(mysql_error());    
    echo "<table border='1'>"; 
    echo "<tr style=\"background-color: OldLace \"> <th>ISBN</th> <th>TITLE</th>  
                           <th>Author Name</th> <th>Publisher Name</th> </tr>"; 
    // keeps getting the next row until there are no more to get 
    while($row = mysql_fetch_array( $result2 )) 
    { // Print out the contents of each row into a table 
          echo "<tr><td>";  
          echo $row['isbn']; 
          echo "</td><td>";  
          echo $row['title']; 
          echo "</td><td>"; 
          echo $row['authorname']; 
          echo "</td><td>";  
          echo $row['publishername'];     
          echo "</td></tr>"; 
    }  
    echo "</table>"; 
    echo"<br />"; 
?>   
 
 
4.4 DISCUSSION 
 
The knowledge of database systems, Web technologies and Web based database systems 
as a whole was the new area to my carrier. Database systems involve a real application of 
programming. When you enter a new programming area you are faced with a real 
challenge. My research work involves development of a Web based learning management 
system. In order to proceed well with my research it was wiser to start with a simple 
application of Web based technologies. The easiest way to learn new area, especially 
programming, is by employing “learn by doing” technique, that is, you learn to do by 
doing. Nellen et al. (2000) emphasize this by saying that if knowledge is power, then we 
gain that knowledge by doing.   
 
I am personally realizing the power of “knowledge by doing” after starting developing e-
LMS for Tanzania secondary schools. I have noticed that the knowledge gained when 
developing e-bookstore shop is the base for: 
• Understanding and easy follow-up of open source codes for open source e-
learning platform during customization  
• Creating codes for e-LMS 
• Modifying  open source codes to suite our requirements 
 
The coming chapter gives the system requirement and specifications for the e-LMS to be 
developed. 
  68 
 
5. THE e-LMS SYSTEM REQUIREMENT AND SPECIFICATIONS 
 
 
5.1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Learning materials can be delivered to learners in many ways including the use of 
learning management systems, the use of compact disk read only memory (CD-ROMs) 
and even face-to-face delivery (this is hybrid or blended e-learning) (Lating, 2006). 
Learning design has the potential to develop e-learning by capturing the process of 
education, rather than simply content (learning materials). This is done by using learning 
management system, thus LMS is among the selected way to be used in learning material 
delivery and it is the one addressed in this research. Learning Management Systems play 
a central role in the Web-based e-learning scenario (Watson et al., 2004). It connects 
learning contents and learners together in a standardized manner.  It manages users, 
content learning materials and learning events. It manages and administers learning 
progress and keep track on learning performance. It manages and administers 
administrative tasks too. 
 
Development of e-LMS use object oriented system analysis and design (OOSA&D) 
approach along with the power of modeling as applied in Model Driven Architecture 
(MDA). System requirement and specification phase from system development life cycle 
(SDLC) in OOSA & D is related to Computation Independent Model (CIM) of the MDA. 
Modeling will make use of UML language. The main advantage of UML is that different 
modeling notations can be used at different stages of system development life cycle 
(SDLC) to represent the system at a proper level of abstraction and to describe both the 
static structure and dynamic behavior of the system. During requirement specification, 
UML will capture the requirements of the users of the system and will create the system 
functions and describe sequence of interactions between actors (users) and the system 
using a use-case model. 
 
Larman 2004 argues that system requirement is the process whereby users’ needs in a 
software project are identified, modeled and validated. Requirement Specification is 
concerned with capturing and analyzing the requirements of the client to a system (Yong 
et al., 2003). System requirement is the most important aspect of building an information 
system because it is at this moment where what is to be built is being decided. System 
requirement is an iterative process by which the needs and requirements of individuals 
and groups significant to the development are researched and identified. When combined 
with the system analysis stage, the major information for design of a new system can be 
addressed and documented. This stage describes the system objectives, the work and its 
constraints to which designers have to comply. The emphasis is on finding and describing 
the objects or concepts in the problem domain (Larman, 2004). With this regard, this 
chapter is presenting the followings: 
• Identified system requirements 
• The e-LMS system architecture components 
• The e-LMS system functions 
• Stake holders and their privileges in using e-LMS  
  69 
 
• Technology and standards, and 
• The e-LMS system architecture 
 
 
5.2 IDENTIFIED SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS 
 
The aim of the first survey presented as part “A” in chapter two (2) was to study the level 
of e-readiness for project implementation. The findings show that there is a positive 
movement towards the use of ICT in e-learning in the following areas14:  
 At National level, one of the objectives of the National ICT Policy of Tanzania is to 
use ICT to improve the quality of delivery of education and training in all areas 
including distance learning 
 The concerned Ministry, MoEVT has formulated “ICT policy for basic education” to 
guide the integration of ICT in basic education including Tanzanian secondary school 
education 
 There are a good number of licensed data communication providers in the country 
namely; TTCL, Wilken Afsat, Datel Tanzania, Equant Tanzania, Simbanet Tanzania, 
Soft Tech Tanzania and Fastcom Africa. TTCL being the Government affiliated 
integrated telecommunication company  
 Many of the secondary schools surveyed have at least basic requirements including a 
school computer laboratory, computers, a school library; electricity, telephone and 
security for the safekeeping of expensive computer systems 
 Some of the on-going ICT projects in Tanzania will accelerate easy implementation 
of e-learning for secondary schools’ project. One being the “ICT Implementation in 
Teachers’ Colleges” (http://www.teachers.or.tz). The project is sponsored by Sida and 
is aiming to improve the quality of pre-service and in-service teacher education by 
using ICT. MoEVT has also introduced a secondary school syllabus for computer 
studies 
 
The aim of the second survey was to find, identify and substantiate problems facing 
Tanzanian secondary schools. Solutions on how to overcome identified problems lead to 
having system requirements for e-LMS to be developed (as stated in part “B” of chapter 
2). Leffingwell et al. (2003) insist on starting with problem analysis during system 
requirement phase. They define problem analysis to be the process of understanding real-
world problems and user's needs and proposing solutions to meet those needs. 
Leffingwell et al. (2003) key points are: 
• The goal of the problem analysis is to gain a better understanding of the problem 
being solved, before development begins  
• To identify the root cause, or the problem behind the problem, ask the people 
directly involved 
• Identifying the actors on the system is a key step in problem analysis 
 
                                                 
14 Findings mentioned towards the use of ICT in e-Learning are all clearly discussed in Part A of chapter 2 
(ICT Application Status in Tanzania by 2004”. 
  70 
 
Findings from the second survey show the followings two issues to be the mostly needed 
by majority of e-learning stakeholders (as stated in part “B” of chapter 2): 
• The need to have more self learning materials especially in science and 
mathematics subjects 
• The need to have a good number of self test questions and past paper examination 
questions for practice 
 
Identified requirements for e-LMS are the primary source of data towards the 
development of the system. Requirements for developing e-LMS have also taken the 
approach based on the requirements of the LMS system on broader fundamentals, that is, 
secondary source of data. 
 
 
5.3 THE e-LMS SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE COMPONENTS 
 
The e-LMS system architecture is based on the main four components: user component, 
learning material, assessment activities and communication resources. User component is 
concerned with the main users with different roles to participate in the system. Learning 
materials component is concerned with all areas used in delivering a subject. These are 
subject notes which include subject syllabus and examples. Subject notes are composed 
of chapters and topics. Assessment activities involve all aspects dealing with evaluating 
or assessing the learners’ understanding of the provided learning materials. Assessment 
activities contains subject self test questions, chapter exercises and topic exercises. 
Communication resources involve all components in creating collaboration among users 
in the system.  Figure 5.1 shows e-LMS architecture components.

5.4 THE e-LMS SYSTEM FUNCTIONS 
 
System functions are what a system is supposed to do (Liu, 2001; Yong et al., 2003). In 
other words, system functions are a list of the specific capabilities a system should be 
able to do. The system's functions are categorized into two groups (Liu, 2001; Yong et 
al., 2003):  
 Evident functions: are functions that are performed by the system and user are able to 
tell if they are performed 
 Hidden functions: are functions that are performed by the system but user need not be 
able to tell that they are performed 
 
Like any other learning management system, the e-LMS is aimed at managing learning 
activities. Referring to some of the system functions noted by Yong et al. (2003), the 
following as shown in table 5.1 are the basic functions for the e-LMS:

5.5 STAKE-HOLDERS AND THEIR PRIVILEGES IN USING e-LMS 
 
The focus of the e-LMS is placed on providing teachers and students with the necessary 
IT tools for accessing the educational material and communicating with each other. The 
e-LMS is considering more users rather than only teachers and students. In each role, use 
case model is shown to summarize the external interactions between use cases and actors. 
As summarized in figure 5.2, every user of the system will be able to perform the 
following basic functions: 
 
• Login into the system 
• Logout of the system  
• Change password 
• Call help on system functionality 
• Access provided calendar 
• View self login report 
• Send e-mail to other users 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.5.1 Student  
 
Represents a role of a person who uses learning resources to gain knowledge or skills. 
The e-LMS is intended to provide students with learning materials and make them 
communicate with other users (student or teacher) by e-mail. Each student may 
participate in more than one registered subject and can access the subject materials. 
 
Adopting the categorization of students from Nykänen et al. (1997), students are 
categorized into two groups: privately registered student and school registered student. 
Figure 5.3 shows categories of students in e-LMS. 
 
 Private registered student is a private student registered to a system privately and not 
via any school. The registration for private students will be performed by the system 
administrator. Private student will have the rights to participate in all privileges 
provided for the student. The learning progress will be recorded for this group of 
students. To easily identify a privately registered student, private students will be 
provided with the unique identification. 
 
 School registered student is a student registered to a system through school 
enrollment. The registration for school registered students will be performed by the 
school administrator. School registered student will have all the rights to participate 
in all privileges provided for the student. The learning progress will be recorded for 
this group of students. To identify a school registered student, login information will 
include providing unique identification for the concerned school. 
 
As summarized in figure 5.4, a registered student will perform the following specific 
functions in the system: 
• View and/or download learning materials 
• View and/or download assessment questions 
• Provide answers to self test questions 
• View self test performance report

5.5.2 Teacher 
 
Teachers are registered to use the e-LMS by the school administrator. Some competent 
teachers will provide learning materials as per their area of specialization. Then these 
learning materials will be uploaded into the learning material repository centrally by the 
content administrator. In this view, teachers will make use of the system just like students 
to access learning materials, though they will be having extra privileges like accessing 
reference answers if available to the given chapter and topic exercises. Teachers will 
support their school students during the learning process. A teacher will perform the 
following specific functions in the system, and summarized in figure 5.4: 
• View and/or download learning materials 
• View and/or download assessment questions 
• View and/or download reference answers for all exercises 
• View students’ log-in history of his/her school 
• View student’s interaction with learning materials history of his/her school 
• View student’s interaction with assessment activities history of his/her school

5.5.3 School Administrator 
 
The school will be registered to the system and identified by the school unique number 
(like registration number). A school administrator is responsible in managing students 
and teachers of his/her school to the system. Any user registered through a school will be 
identified by a hidden school unique number after providing personal login information. 
As summarized in figure 5.5, a school administrator will perform the following specific 
functions in the system: 
• Register students of the school to the system 
• Register teachers of the school to the system 
• Update student’s personal particulars of his/her school

(MoEVT). This is the role for monitoring the progress of the e-LMS system and viewing 
contents available in the system. MoEVT has educational center offices at regional and 
district levels in Tanzania. The aim of educational centers is to assist in providing 
important services closer to remote secondary school. These offices are well equipped 
with resources like telephone, electricity and computer. MoEVT has also provided 
Internet connectivity to some educational centers and planning to have all centers be 
provided with the Internet. MoEVT officers will come from Ministry head quarter and/or 
from these educational center offices. MoEVT officer will perform the following specific 
functions in the system, and as summarized in figure 5.8: 
• View and/or download learning materials

5.6 TECHNOLOGY AND STANDARDS  
 
The e-learning management system is developed based on open source software Web 
based technologies and standards.  
 
 
5.6.1 Web Based Technologies 
 
Most of these Web based technologies and services are free and meets the World Wide 
Web Consortium (W3C). The ones to be used are:  
• HTML, XHTML, CSS and JavaScript browser scripting language for interactivity 
• PHP server scripting language, Apache Web server and MySQL database engine 
• Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) for data description, structure, store and 
interoperability 
 
 
5.6.2 Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) 
The e-LMS will stick on to standards and the Sharable Content Object Reference Model 
(SCORM) is the standard to be adopted. The e-LMS will be a SCORM-compliant LMS 
in order to properly deliver and track SCORM-compliant learning content as it has been 
applied by SumTotal Systems (2003 – 2005). 
 
SCORM is a suite of technical standards that enable Web-based learning systems to find, 
import, share, reuse, and export learning content in a standardized way. The SCORM is a 
conceptual model describing how to manage, package and deliver learning information so 
that it can be easily shared on the Internet. As shown in figure 5.10, the basic overview of 
SCORM is that it assumes the existence of a suite of services called by some a “Learning 
Management System (LMS)” and by others a “Learning Content Management System 
(LCMS)” (Albert et al., 2004), and formerly called a "Computer Managed Instruction" 
system. In the SCORM world there is a set of services that launches learning content, 
keeps track of learner progress, figures out in what order (sequence) learning objects are 
to be delivered, and reports student mastery through a learning experience. During the 
evolution of the SCORM suite of specifications, a standardized way was needed for 
content to send information back and forth between the learner (content) and the LMS. 
 
SCORM has two main parts: 
 Content Aggregation Model (CAM) which is concerned on how to put learning 
content together so it can be moved and reused 
 Run-Time Environment which is concerned on how the learning content is going to 
be launched and the learner’s progress be tracked and reported back 
 
Albert et al. (2004) defined SCORM as a set of interrelated technical specifications built 
upon the work of the Aviation Industry CBT (Computer-Based Training) Committee 
(AICC), Instructional Management Systems (IMS) and Institute of Electrical and 
Electronic Engineers (IEEE) to create one unified “content model” and enable the re-use 
of Web-based learning content across multiple environment and products. 
  80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.7 THE e-LMS SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 
 
The e-learning management system (e-LMS) will be a client- server, Web based system 
with a three-tier architecture. The system will consist of three major components: the 
MySQL database server that stores all the information and data needed including the 
means to link to the learning content repository, the apache application server that control 
the communication (basic system functionalities) and the client that is used by users in 
order to access data from the server (Web interface accessible via standard Web 
browsers). The three components will be networked to facilitate communication among 
them. Three-tier architecture has the following specific advantages (Kinshuk et al., 2003): 
• It is easy to modify or replace any tier without affecting the other tiers 
• Separating application and database functionality means better load balancing 
• Adequate security policies can be enforced with the server tier without hindering 
the clients 
 
As illustrated in figure 5.11, the architecture will consist of the following: 
 
i. The Client Tier: also known as the user interface layer, will run the end-user’s 
computer. The client provides the user interface for the Web-based application. It is a 
front-end layer. Using a computer, the user will access database through the Web 
server. The access to the computer will be possible by using created Web pages 
through any standard Web browser which support HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, and 
CSS Web technologies.  
 
ii. The application Tier: will be responsible for interacting with the client in one side 
and the databases (database server and content repository) in another side. 
Application tier receives and processes data requests from the client, retrieves 
information (data) from database if any needed, generates a client response and store 
necessary data into the database. Application tier provide Web services and the data 
streaming services. Apache Web server to be used will be running in LINUX 
platform. A server side scripting language to be used is PHP and it will be used to 
connect to the back-end (database).

  81 
 
iii. The database Tier: is the place where data will be stored. The database server 
maintains the data needed for the Web application.  It is a back-end layer. It will store 
data (including links to learning content repository) and control the basic system 
functionality. This tier may run on a separate server called the database server. 
MySQL database running in LINUX platform will be used in this case. Database 
server is responsible for providing a number of functionalities to the application layer 
(server), like; creation of the database, querying and updating it where required. 
Database server will also maintain data constraints and integrity and the restriction of 
unauthorized access. Multiple data interfaces, views, reports and the provision of 
backup and recovery will also be implemented. 
 
Application server, database server and learning material repository will be centrally 
placed at the College of Engineering and Technology (CoET) of the University of Dar-
es-Salaam (UDSM). Distributed users will be able to browse learning materials using any 
standard Web browsers through application server. 
 
To increase availability and overcome lower bandwidth, Local server will be placed at 
Kibaha pilot site. Local server will get the replicated database from the main server. 
Users at kibaha will be able to access learning materials from the local server as well.

6. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
 
6.1 CONCLUSION 
 
From what has been discussed in previous chapters the following concluding remarks can 
be made. 
 
 
i) Open Source Software 
 
Tanzania being a developing country can not afford the cost of commercial software. It is 
wise to effectively use the advantaged opportunities brought by open source community. 
There is a possibility of creating something concrete using open source software. In that 
case, we have decided the e-LMS system to be fully developed using OSS. Benefits of 
OSS as published by Hall (2008) include:  
• Low initial cost: open source software is free to download  
• Flexibility and customizability: one can modify the software whenever the need 
arises 
• Extensive active user communities: participating in open source projects is a 
source of distinction among developers  
• Multi-platform capabilities: many open source applications run on multiple 
platforms including Windows and Linux 
• Adherence to standards: interoperability is a high priority for many open source 
developers 
• Tendency to use and link to other open source software: including popular 
languages and platforms such as PHP and MySQL database  
 
OSS to be used include Apache a World Wide Web open source server software, MySQL 
database management system (DBMS), PHP scripting language and OS LMS for 
customization, here Moodle and Claroline. Customization of OS LMS is however a 
challenging task since many of the present OS LMS are designed for higher learning 
institutions. This research is dealing with the lower education level that is secondary 
schools. We find very few features which directly suite our needs.  
 
 
ii) Specific Objectives as Related to Research Questions 
 
System requirement and specification phase is the base for the development of the e-LMS 
system. This is the phase where most important attributes for building an information 
system are identified and validated. If properly done, the process of development will not 
be stacked easily and it will be easily traced for modification. Development of an 
interactive e-LMS as the main objective has three specific objectives. This phase being a 
base has to provide partial answers of the research questions created for each specific 
objective before final implementation. Consistently, this research has three research 
  83 
 
questions related to specific objectives. Research questions were created based on the 
following key services to be implemented by the e-LMS system. 
 
Sharing of learning materials 
The purpose of developing e-LMS is in facilitating sharing of contents. This is done 
through creating a three-tier architecture where learning materials will be centrally 
created and stored in a content repository. All users will have access to the centrally 
placed materials through a Web browser. Only one role “content Administrator” will be 
allowed to create and upload learning material to the system. Organizing e-LMS in a 
three-tier architecture is the partial answer for the research question number one (RQ1). 
 
15RQ1:  How can learning materials content be made available 
and sharable among several students and teachers? 
 
Availability as included in RQ1 is another issue of doubt due to high costs of the Internet. 
Availability of the database learning materials will be strengthened by mirroring the 
database and replicating full or part of the content from the main database to the local 
servers. A local server is planned to be servicing cluster of schools in nearby area. We 
need one local server for Kibaha secondary school and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary in 
Kibaha. In other words using Intranet network in education will reduce costs 
considerably and promote security of stored information and sharing of information from 
the database (Kamthan, 1998). As indicated in the e-LMS system functions, database 
mirroring and replication will be handled by the database management system (DBMS) 
through proper settings. Specific objective for the research question number one is hereby 
stated as: 
 
16SO1: To develop a module so as to enable creation, storing, 
publication and sharing of learning materials 
 
Security Issues 
A critical issue in databases is security. The risks of a database system include 
unauthorized access to confidential data, unauthorized modification of data and loss of 
availability of the data (17NISCC, 2003). Data here means administrative information 
used by the database and all other information stored in the database including learning 
materials. Research question based on security issues is: 
 
RQ2: In which ways can the e-LMS database and the information 
stored inside, including learning materials be secured? 
 
There are measures to be implemented in the database to counter these threats. These 
measures as suggested by NISCC (2003) have been indicated in this research to answer 
research question number two (RQ2) as follows: 
                                                 
15 RQ – Research Questions 
16 SO – Specific Objective 
17 NISCC - National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre 
  84 
 
 Identification and authentication of users is one way where username and passwords 
will be used. In this research, the e-LMS system validates logins information 
(username and password) entered by the user in order to use the system and allow the 
registered user to login/out to the system. 
 
 Access control is another way of securing the database and the stored information. In 
this research, access control is being taken care of by organizing users by role-based 
access control. Each user will be assigned the role and the system will display 
available resources for that role. Many of the roles assigned have “read only” or 
“view” capability except for “content administrator” who creates and uploads 
learning material. We have minimized number of roles to upload data in the system 
for integrity purposes. 
 
 Database backups and recovery is another way of proving security. This will be done 
by the e-LMS system as a hidden function by proper settings, hence included as a 
system function. Mirroring of the database and replication to local server is another 
way of backing-up the database. 
 
The e-LMS system is also considering security of the database server itself. This is 
limiting access not only to the information stored on it, but access to the server having the 
database. Database back-end should never be on the same machine as the Web server, not 
only for security but also for performance (Wiedman, 2008). Again a three-tier 
architecture for the e-LMS separates database server from the users (client-tier) using a 
Web server (application-tier). Only the address of the Web server will be allowed to 
access the database server. Specific objective for the research question number two 
(RQ2) is hereby stated as: 
 
SO2: To develop mechanisms for protecting the database and the 
information stored, as well as manage users of the system 
and the workflow of the learning materials 
 
Evaluation and Assessment Issues 
Evaluating the usage of the e-LMS by the targeted users is a very important aspect. The 
system is being developed for the stakeholders to use. The research has provided the 
mechanism for tracking several events for future evaluation of the usage of the system 
which answers research question number three (RQ3): 
 Tracking of user login and logout, to evaluate the number of users who will log in 
into the system 
 Tracking of student’s interaction with learning materials. Students are number one 
targeted users. The interaction with learning materials will indicate that students are 
really using learning materials stored in e-LMS 
 
RQ3: How can the e-LMS monitor the learning progress of the 
students, as well as the student’s understanding to the 
visited learning materials? 
 
  85 
 
Tracking history of student’s logins especially based on the individual school will help in 
evaluating the performance improvement level of the school in National Examinations. 
Once the system is implemented, and if logins and interactions with learning materials 
will not be convincing, teachers and school administrators will be able to motivate their 
students to use the system. 
 
Assessment is one of the main techniques for checking and monitoring students’ level of 
understanding the knowledge read from the learning materials (Avgeriou et al., 2003). 
Learning materials are accompanied with a number of exercises to make students assess 
the knowledge she/he has obtained. The e-LMS is providing tracking of student’s 
interaction for this purpose. The system also provides self test assessment, where by a 
student will be asked self test questions in multiple choice forms related to selected 
chapter/topic materials. He / she will answer questions and send to the system. The 
system will return student’s performance right away. Specific objective for the research 
question number three (RQ3) is hereby read as: 
 
SO3: To develop ways of evaluating students’ learning progress 
through e-LMS, including means of assessment functions 
 
We can see that only two needs were identified during requirement analysis, namely the 
need to have more learning materials and more assessment questions.  But, coming to the 
implementation in order to meet these needs, there are lots of considerations to be taken 
care of and they have impacts which refer to a complex system. 
 
 
iii) Experience with Participatory Research Methodology 
 
The significance of participatory action research methodology is very crucial not only to 
social and medical sciences, but even in Information Systems (IS) development. 
Experience gained in requirement finding reveals that, people are very much willing to 
contribute their views when it comes to issues for their own or public sake benefit. The 
students’ registration database developed for Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary created a good 
relationship among us researchers and the school staff. School teachers were free and part 
and parcel even when participating for the e-LMS development. Teachers and students 
were open-minded when identifying problems facing Tanzania secondary schools 
education system. Participatory action research methodology is also a way of exchanging 
knowledge, that is, users giving their experiences about their system they are in and 
researchers giving new suggestions and techniques to improve that system. Knowledge 
introduced on how the power of ICT can effectively be used to improve social lives to 
our two pilot schools. Wali-ul-Asr and KSS have created a noticeable motivation and 
build interest on the coming technological change ahead of them. 
 
 
 
 
 
  86 
 
iv) Value of Licentiate Programme 
 
The licentiate programme was totally a new thing to me. This is because there is no such 
a programme at the University of Dar es Salaam. However, I happen to like the 
programme very much because of the following I have experienced and which have 
helped me considerably: 
• Clear and open plan of the programme especially the need to participate relevant 
courses of the research area involved. In this research, some few courses like Web 
based technologies (HTML, XHTML, JavaScript, PHP), Web page design and 
research methodology course were and still are very helpful to my research 
• Acceleration towards PhD thesis is again an added advantage instead of having a 
solid programme direct to PhD completion 
 
Taking licentiate degree as a transitional degree to pursue doctorate studies to my opinion 
is very much worth. In Swedish it is called “Teknologie Licentiat”, usually abbreviated as 
“Tekn. Lic”. 
 
 
6.2 MAIN CONTRIBUTION 
 
i) Contribution Academically in Methodological View 
 
Development of an interactive e-Learning Management System for Tanzanian secondary 
schools is incorporating a number of methodologies: 
 
OOSA &D, MDA and PAR 
The contribution towards this is mainly on how to effectively exploit the power of 
modeling as applied in OOSA&D and MDA using UML together with participatory 
action research methodology in a real-time development of software. We can see that the 
requirements and specifications for e-LMS to be developed are contextually specific to 
Kibaha secondary school and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary, pilot schools. Modeling have 
been used to communicate key system characteristics to various stakeholders of Tanzania 
education system at pilot schools and at the MoEVT (students, teachers, 
headmaster/headmistress and Ministry officials) from early stages and come up with the 
requirements of e-LMS. Participatory action research methodology is a continuous 
process. It will be practiced until a functional system is obtained. Participatory action 
research methodology is a new technique in problem solving especially in our College of 
Engineering and Technology (CoET) of the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM).  
 
The approach of using OOSA&D in developing functional system like e-LMS is a new 
methodology to be introduced in the faculty of Electrical and Computer System 
Engineering (ECSE) and the College of Engineering and Technology (CoET) at large. 
For a long time only one approach was employed, that is using structured approach in 
system analysis and design. Many non-Governmental and Government organizations are 
employing Software Engineering (SE) in their business applications. With this new 
methodology, CoET will be able to assist the public in such related works. Having 
  87 
 
varieties of software development techniques, ECSE can easily establish SE department, 
which is not there as well as establishment of new research area in software development 
at ECSE and CoET. 
 
One of the obligations of higher institutions is to disseminate knowledge to others. Being 
a lecturer under the department of Computer and Systems Engineering (CSE), ECSE, 
CoET, my contribution to the CoET will be through building capacity to learners of this 
area. 
 
Furthermore, object oriented system analysis and design with UML gives the e-LMS 
Platform Independent Model (PIM). Being the added contribution, the research continues 
more on applying MDA transformations to obtain e-LMS Platform Specific Model 
(PSM) for implementation. 
 
Use of Open Source Software 
The use of open source software is starting to be known to the UDSM community and 
other higher institutions. UDSM for many years has been using blackboard LMS which is 
a commercial platform. Due to higher costs UDSM is now customizing open source LMS 
to replace commercial platform after completion. The good part is that many OS LMS are 
for higher instructions. It is easy for UDSM to customize these OS LMS. Employing 
open source software to lower level of secondary schools is a commendable thing 
because we are transforming OS LMS for higher institutions to make them suite lower 
level of education, who majority of them have very little knowledge in ICT. 
 
 
ii) Contribution to the Public 
 
International Conference and Journal Papers 
So far we have managed to present two papers in international conferences. These papers 
are included in International Journals. As indicated in Appendix A (A.2 and A.3), our 
first paper is titled “An Interactive e-Learning Management System (e-LMS): A Solution 
to Tanzanian Secondary Schools’ Education” and our second paper is titled “Strategies 
for Developing e-LMS for Tanzania Secondary Schools”. All papers are included in the 
conference proceedings of World Academy of Science, Engineering and Technology 
(WASET) and in International Journal of Social Sciences (IJSS). Any one who is 
interested can make them as a reference. 
 
Open Source Community 
Modified source codes for e-LMS will enter into the open source world such that any one 
can modify and re-use them. This is a contribution to the open source community. 
Customization of open source LMS platforms is being used to develop a system which is 
optionally fitted in our specific context. 
 
e-LMS Model for Tanzania Secondary Schools 
Dynamic and Interactive e-LMS is a special gift to Kibaha secondary school and Wali-ul-
Asr girls’ seminary, and may be latter to Tanzanian secondary schools community as a 
  88 
 
whole. It is the first one to be introduced and developed so far. The end product will be a 
quality based context done at our environment. Tanzanian secondary schools 
stakeholders from pilot schools will be part and parcel of it from scratch. At the end of 
the PhD research we will have an e-LMS model for secondary schools at Kibaha which 
was not there. 
 
6.3 WORK DONE SO FAR 
 
Identification of the methodologies to be used in developing e-LMS system was among 
the major work done in the licentiate thesis. A thorough theoretical study of the identified 
methods was given a priority, sometimes even “learning by doing” approach was 
employed whenever it was needed. Being confident with the methodology to be used 
gives guidance on steps towards developing software and consistent flow of development 
will be reached. 
 
In software development, successful Information System is a subject of frequent 
evaluation and revision within a framework known as System Development Life-Cycle 
(SDLC). SDLC is the basic approach for most software development methodologies. 
System’s life cycle for e-LMS development consists of four principal phases:  
• System Requirement and Specification phase 
• System Analysis and System Design Phase 
• System Implementation Phase 
• Testing Phase 
 
System requirement and specification phase is an important area covered fully in the 
licentiate report. This is because at this phase all major information for designing a new 
system is being addressed. System requirement and specification phase was preceded by 
database planning where strengths and weaknesses for the current secondary schools 
education system were evaluated and the main objective was identified. It was then 
followed by describing the scope and boundaries of the database application and the 
major user views in the system description as it has been suggested by Connolly et al. 
(2005). User view defines what is required of a database system from the perspective of a 
particular role (for example student, teacher) or application area (such as managing 
subject). A user view also defines what is required of the database system in terms of the 
data to be held and the transactions to be performed on the data (Connolly et al., 2005).  
 
We have seen requirement collection and analysis as a process of collecting and 
analyzing information from different stakeholders of the Tanzania education system that 
is to be supported by the database system, and using this information to identify the 
requirements for the new system. These requirements were described in documents 
collectively referred to as requirement specification for the new database system. The 
information collected at this stage was converted into a more structured statement of 
requirements. This is use case model as applied by Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
(Connolly et al., 2005).  
 
 
  89 
 
6.4 FUTURE WORK 
 
System analysis and system design, system implementation and testing phases are future 
works for PhD completion. System analysis will involve analyzing the system 
requirements and identifying concepts of the system, creating the conceptual diagram, 
identifying system operations through system conceptual diagrams and system operations 
contracts. System design will involve creation of interactive diagrams (sequence and 
collaborative diagrams), design class diagram and component diagram in OOSA&D as 
related to platform independent model (PIM) of MDA. The platform specific model for e-
LMS (physical database) will be reached after involving mappings using XMI and data 
from the open source LMS platform to be customized.  
 
Connolly et al. (2005) state that system (database) design phase, and application designs 
are parallel activities of database SDLC. Application design is the design of the user 
interface and the application programs (coding) that use and process the database. 
Application design involves designing the application programs that access the database, 
designing appropriate user interface to the database system and designing the transactions 
(that is, the database access methods) (Connolly et al., 2005). In this thesis, application 
design will be extended to implementation phase. 
 
Security issues to the e-LMS will highly be considered in future work during system 
analysis & design and implementation phases. All areas of security which include; server 
security, user-based authentication security and session security will be incorporated. 
Effectiveness of applying learning management system to Tanzanian secondary schools 
at Kibaha is another crucial area to be highlighted in the future work. The affordability of 
using LMS against the current education system in terms of cost will also be covered. 
 
Finally, the developed e-LMS will be tested for its functionality in the computer lab 
before implemented at Kibaha secondary school and Wali-ul-Asr girls’ seminary. 
Connolly et al. (2005) highlighting by saying that testing should cover usability of the 
database system, and an evaluation should be conducted against a usability specification. 
Examples of criteria that can be used to conduct the evaluation include: 
• Learnability – How long does it take a new user to become productive with the 
system? 
• Performance – How well does the system response match the user’s work 
practice? 
• Robustness – How tolerant is the system of user error? 
• Recoverability – How good is the system at recovering from user errors? 
• Adaptability – How closely is the system tied to a single model of work? 
 
After completing testing the developed e-LMS in the computer lab, then as mentioned, 
database will be ready to be used by two selected pilot schools, that is, Kibaha secondary 
school and Wali-ul-ASR girls’ seminary at Kibaha, Pwani region.

6.5 TanSSe-L 
 
Every system has a unique name. Tanzania Secondary School e-Learning (TanSSe-L) is 
the name given to the e-learning system we are developing. The name reflects the system 
ownership of all Tanzanian secondary schools including Government and private 
secondary schools (community, mission, individual).

Abstract— Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) has been integrated in education in many 
developing and developed countries alike, but the use of ICT in Tanzanian schools is dismal. Many Tanzanian 
secondary schools have no computers. The few schools with computers use them primarily for secretarial services and 
computer literacy training.  
The Tanzanian education system at other levels like secondary school level has to undergo substantial 
transformation, underscored by the growing application of new information and communication technology.  This 
paper presents the e-readiness survey result from secondary schools in Tanzania. The paper also suggests how Tanzania 
can make use of the few present ICT resources to support and improve teaching and learning functions to improve 
performance and acquisition of knowledge by using e-Learning Management System (e-LMS). 
 
Keywords— e-Learning, ICT, Object-Oriented, Participatory design,   
I. INTRODUCTION 
ANZANIAN secondary schools in rural areas are geographically and socially isolated, hence face a 
number of problems in getting learning materials and quality teachers. The schools face three critical 
issues that are global in perspective, but remain focused on the learners' needs. These are shortage of 
teachers, quality of teaching and the capacity of schools in terms incentives/motivations [7]. The focus now 
in Tanzania to improve teaching and learning is to raise the standard of teachers’ preparation programs, 
increase degree attainment of teachers and increase classroom strategies in service training. The drive can 
only be effective by providing support to teachers by providing adequacy access to basic up-to-date 
information resources like textbooks and reference materials. Also laboratories for science subjects need to 
be well equipped and teaching aids available. Even some regional schools can not attract good teachers 
because of opportunities in their locality and pay scale. The situation is aggravated by the low number of 
committed and competent teachers compared with demand. 
The Government is making big effort to improve the situation but is overwhelmed by the rate of increase 
secondary schools and students, which stretches beyond limit the available teachers and teaching and 
learning resources. These constraints result in poor performance and low morale, particularly in rural and in 
some urban schools. Performance is more critical in science and mathematics subjects in rural schools. 
One of several ways to encounter these constrains is to make use of ICT. The National ICT Policy of 
Tanzania [9] [8] highlights that ICT encompasses telecommunications services, computers and associated 
peripherals, Internet services, e-mail, fax, broadcasting, TVs and other media . One of the objectives of the 
National ICT Policy of Tanzania is to use ICT to improve the quality of delivery of education and training 
in all areas including distance learning. Achieving these objectives is however a process. 
II. TANZANIA SECONDARY SCHOOLS’ E-READINESS SURVEY 
E-readiness studies were conducted in Tanzania showing that the country is gradually entering the

global information society, however the available resources limit the pace considerably. This study is part 
of a bigger project of ICT for e-learning in rural secondary schools. 
Ten locations were chosen as pilot study areas, where six schools were selected in each area. These were 
visited and surveyed. The locations were: Bagamoyo, Iringa, Kibaha, Kilwa, Mkuranga, Moshi, Morogoro, 
Mwanga, Songea, Mbeya, Dodoma and Arusha. The survey covered e-readiness of schools, data providers 
and that of the relevant Ministry. The end selection of a pilot area was based on the following criteria: 
vicinity and accessibility from each other and teaching science based subjects.  
 
A. Data Communication Service Providers  
Twaakyondo, Bhalalusesa and Ndalichako [10] found that Tanzania through its regulatory authority the 
Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) has provided license to six companies to provide 
Public Data Communication Services. The licenses did not include provision of voice services. Only two 
companies were initially granted exclusive rights to provide wired network telecom services - one in each 
part of the republic. 
Yonah [12] indicates that TTCL/SIMUNET is implementing 10 zonal Points of Presence (PoP), 27 at 
regional level and over 70 at district level. The intention being to allow Internet-access connectivity by 
dial-up to become local calls in many places in Tanzania. There are five licensed mobile phone operators 
that use the services of fixed network companies for interconnection and for backbone services.  
There are a number of licensed Internet Services Providers (ISPs) that is growing day by day.  These are 
either using the Point-of-Presence or satellite connection.   
 
B. Availability of Computers 
In the study made to assess e-readiness in schools the availability of telecommunications services, 
computers and associated peripherals and Internet services to the schools were observed. The results show 
that many schools have acquired computers through own initiative or effort using school funds or donation 
from donors or provided by the Government. Many schools have landline telephone connection but only 
very few manage to have Internet service connected because of operational costs.  
Table I and fig. 1 show a summary state of availability of computers for the 71 secondary schools that 
were surveyed in 10 regions out of a total 21 regions of Tanzania Mainland.  Assessment of availability of 
computers was considered to be fundamental because computer is a basic resource to facilitate use of ICT.  
It is important to note however that the student population in such schools range from 400 to 1500. This is 
clearly a desperate situation.

It was observed that many schools have desire for and are making efforts to procure computers. The 
adequacy of infrastructures, logistics and competent personnel in schools is a major constraint to the 
availability and use of ICT in schools.  Addo [2] considers the critical requirements to be a computer 
laboratory, a school library, electricity, a telephone and adequate security to ensure safekeeping of 
computer systems. The study shows that of the 71 surveyed schools 73 % have at least one computer, 35 % 
have one to three, 16 % have 4 to 15 computers and 22 % have more than 16 computers.  
III. E-LEARNING PROJECT COMPONENTS 
There have been efforts to improve secondary education in Tanzania using ICT through several projects. 
Some ended with static websites like: http://www.distancelearning-tz.org. Such websites are accessible to 
students in the urban areas where there are Internet cafes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To complement such efforts in a more dynamic way the University of Dar-es-Salaam through its College 
of Engineering and Technology conceived a research project to develop a tool to enable ICT support rural 
secondary schools. The focus is to enable ICT support with teaching materials, which are user friendly, 
facilitating self learning and information sharing, starting with science and mathematics. The success of 
this research work rests on realizing three basic pillars as shown in fig. 2: Establishment of suitable and 
effective connectivity and configuration, development of a context centered platform which includes e-
learning content management system based and development of the repository structure for local content 
materials to self learning environment and sharing. To minimize operational costs open source platform has 
been chosen. 
Commercial use of ICT in e-learning is gaining momentum in Tanzania particularly when foreign 
universities use local universities and institutions to deliver their programs.  There are local ventures but 
with limited scope.  There is also a teleconference facility [5], a project funded by World Bank. But the 
cost for using the facilities is very high.  Another African Virtual University (AVU) project established by 
the World Bank in 1997 involved a total of 31 learning centers established in 17 African Nations [6]. The 
benefits of using ICT for e-learning includes cost reduction, wider access beyond physical walls 
classrooms, performance improvement, quality enhancement and creation of new products and services.  
IV. DEVELOPMENT OF E-LMS 
E-learning is an attentive concept, subject to wide variation in practice, which has become a common 
mode of education delivery worldwide. Akeroyd [3] elaborates this by stating that the extreme case is the 
use of the web technology to facilitate the whole cycle of learning from initial sign-on to final certification. 
There will be a range of operations in between, with no or little physical interaction among learners. Hence, 
the World-Wide-Web (WWW) opened a new dimension to computer based training where learners can 
learn from anywhere, anytime with possibilities for huge cost savings in corporate training. Online learning 
has created new dimension to opportunities for collaboration among academic institutions and beyond.  
Access to academic resources is at a level that remained a dream two decades ago. The beneficiaries are 
town duelers in most developing countries.  
The need for learning management systems (LMS) being developed is underlined by Watson et al., [11] 
who argues that the e-learning industry, which includes different groups of users and knowledge 
requirements, needs effective manageable system to monitor the learners’, learning, measure it and provide 
reports on learning efficiency. Hence, constant tracking of the learners’ actions and online tests results can

be done. LMS provide a technological, parameter driven framework to allow individuals develop and 
deliver learning content, to interact with students and to facilitate open discussion. Advancing LMS will 
support a range of administrative functions relating to course delivery and administration to enable e-
learning such as content delivery, performance tracking, management of learners and their courses and 
students’ collaboration. 
A basic LMS is a Web application where the learner logs on and accesses the courses allocated to 
her/him. While the learner is going through the courseware, the LMS stores information about the learners’ 
interactions, such as scores and answers to questions. LMS use this information to analyze how well the 
learner is performing, and are able to provide reports to the administrators and course tutors. Hence a LMS 
should contain an interface for managing users, adding/deleting new learners, organizing learners and 
allocating access rights/courses to uses and user groups. 
The LMS to being developed is model driven and web-based platform in order to carter for wide access 
to a big number of rural secondary schools in different regions. As shown in fig. 3, it is based on three-tier 
architecture and consists of the following: 
Client-Tier: The user interface running in a web browser in the computer, 
Application-Tier: Apache web server will be used running in LINUX platform and  
Database-Tier: MySQL database running in LINUX platform.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The e-learning materials will be centrally stored at the database server with functionality of mirror 
imaging to localities of school. Distributed users will be able to browse learning materials using any 
standard internet browser through application server. Security of information in the central server and its 
mirrors and that in schools is an issue that is still being considered. Both the central application server and 
the database server will be located at the University of Dar es Salaam, College of Engineering and 
Technology.  
V. METHODOLOGY FOR E-LMS DEVELOPMENT 
Software engineering principles applicable in software development shall be employed in the System 
Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). Open Source Software (OSS) platform based on LINUX operating 
system and Web based technologies like HTML markup language, Java Scripting language, Cascading 
Style Sheets (CSS), PHP server side scripting language, MySQL database management system, and 
Apache web server will be used. Understanding of database management systems (DBMS) and data 
modeling is critical.

The importance of considering users in developing computer systems in general has been recognized 
since the 1970s [1]. As a primary source of information our approach in developing e-LMS is participation 
of users from the analysis stage to implementation. Questioners, physical observation and group discussion 
with students, teachers and school administrator is employed. The students/learners remain the focal point 
for users of e-LMS, hence it should satisfy their needs and resolve their problems [4]. Others are teachers, 
school administrators, parents and education official from the Ministry.  
Many of the students, teachers and administrators are not aware of the technology in ICT in education, 
though some are in contact with at least computers. With this respect, gathering user-requirement for a 
platform has also taken the approach to base on the user requirements on broader fundamentals, that is, 
secondary source of data. This includes other researches’ reports, recommendations from an analysis of 
current learning articles, journals, published and unpublished papers, as well as the investigation on the 
existing learning models from open source learning management systems. 
An Object-Oriented system development approach is adopted in this research. The object-oriented 
analysis (OOA) technique used is based on the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) using Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) techniques for the design. Several types of diagrams such as use-case (plus high level and 
extended use cases), sequence, domain, collaboration and design class diagrams will be employed. For a 
web-based system, an extensible markup language (XML) technology is applied, which maps with the 
UML to create a dynamic, interactive web application. Modeling will be obtained by mapping UML and 
XML schema. A high-level design process will follow that evolves into a more detailed design i.e. 
implementation and testing stage. This will involve code generation using high-level language. Code from 
open source software will be used as a base. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The use of ICT provides innovative ways to complement the traditional student-teacher interaction 
worldwide to optimize resource usage, sharing and collaboration. Therefore, the development of e-learning 
facilities for rural areas of Tanzania has high national priorities and hence relevance. Application of ICT in 
e-learning that is accessible in remote and rural schools will improve the performance of students in such 
schools in rural areas as well as raising morale for teachers and students.  
A web-based e-learning management system for Tanzanian secondary schools is necessary and must 
address the peculiarities of local conditions of schools so that ICT resources can be used to improve 
teaching and learning functions accessible beyond urban communities. The e-LMS being developed will 
allow creation, storage, re-use and delivery of digital learning material, and will also manage these 
resources with users from central object repository. To affect the e-LMS, connectivity has to be established 
to secondary schools. Achieving the connectivity other services such as e-healthy, e-commerce, can be 
introduced in the surrounding areas.

Abstract— Tanzania secondary schools in rural areas are geographically and socially isolated, hence face a number 
of problems in getting learning materials resulting in poor performance in National examinations. E-learning as defined 
to be the use of information and communication technology (ICT) for supporting the educational processes has 
motivated Tanzania to apply ICT in its education system. There has been effort to improve secondary school education 
using ICT through several projects. ICT for e-learning to Tanzania rural secondary school is one of the research 
projects conceived by the University of Dar-es-Salaam through its College of Engineering and Technology. The main 
objective of the project is to develop a tool to enable ICT support rural secondary school. 
The project is comprehensive with a number of components, one being development of e-learning management 
system (e-LMS) for Tanzania secondary schools. This paper presents strategies of developing e-LMS. It shows the 
importance of integrating action research methodology with the modeling methods as presented by model driven 
architecture (MDA) and the usefulness of Unified Modeling Language (UML) on the issue of modeling. The benefit of 
MDA will go along with the development based on software development life cycle (SDLC) process, from analysis and 
requirement phase through design and implementation stages as employed by object oriented system analysis and 
design approach. The paper also explains the employment of open source code reuse from open source learning 
platforms for the context sensitive development of the e-LMS for Tanzania secondary schools.

I. INTRODUCTION 
HERE is a lot of results in the field of software engineering concerning the question of how to 
represent systems and how to build a base for communication between the developer and the user of a 
software system [24]. In order to manage the return investment in ICT for education, here referred to e-
learning management system (e-LMS), it is essential that the benefits, risks and cost effectiveness of using 
new technology and new media are well understood in the context of application. An effective approach is 
to involve users in establishing the expected use of ICT and the benefit of it in education.  
 The e-LMS to be developed is for Tanzania secondary school members, who many of them are not 
aware of the ICT technology in education. Modeling methodology is the best way to create visualization of 
the system to be defined. With modeling, complex and real-world systems can be somehow understood, 
qualities of the system can be predicted and communication with stakeholders concerning the key 
characteristics will be promoted [2]. Models are developed as a way of creating a base for implementation 
of the physical system and testing. 
Integrating the action research methodology with the whole issue of employing Model-Driven 
Architecture is of significance. Action research methodology and modeling support each other, when it 
comes to the software development for users. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: section two elaborates on the strategy of using action 
research methodology in developing e-LMS. Section three focuses on the object oriented system analysis 
and design (OOSA&D). Section four gives the employment of Model-Driven Architecture and the use of

the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as the documentation modeling language specified by OMG. The 
strategy of creating Platform Independent Model (PIM) for e-LMS and means of transformation of PIM 
into Platform Specific Model (PSM) is in section five. Another strategy is customization of the selected 
open source LMS platform based on e-LMS PIM is introduced in section six. Section seven gives the need 
for replication of the e-LMS database. Finally the paper will give the conclusion. 
II. ACTION RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
The knowledge on how ICT and its application can improve social and economical life of people is not 
very much known to many of the Tanzania community in general. Although Tanzanian secondary schools 
may have and be in contact with computers, it doesn’t mean that they really are aware of the impact of ICT 
when effectively used towards improving performance. Coming to the issue of developing a LMS for their 
use, the issue of lack of knowledge if not carefully considered, the utilization of LMS may be very minimal 
if at all not completely used. The emphasis of action research methodology is to be a methodology which 
accompanies the introduction of technology as well into organizations and learning. Action research 
represents a specific form of knowledge generation thus, with its methodology the understanding of the use 
of e-LMS will be possible and hence increase assurance towards its utilization. 
The importance of considering users in developing computer systems has been recognized since the 
1970s (Abel et al., 1998) [1]. O’Brien (2001) [13] stated that action research or sometimes known as 
participatory research is “learning by doing”-a group of people identify a problem, do something to resolve 
it, see how successful their efforts were and if not satisfied, try it again. Walker and Hermann [18] also 
argued that participatory design and continuous business improvement can be brought together in a 
framework which presents a set of different phases in a cyclic order. In the Nordic countries the 
“Scandinavian model” was introduced in the middle of the 80s [20], introducing a participatory approach 
involving users for context sensitive and robust IT system solutions. Coming closer to a sub Sahara African 
context the action research conducted in the presented project is more likely linked to participatory rural 
appraisal (PRA) introduced by Chambers (1997) [4] and Rydhagen (2002) [21]. 
Users mainly students, teachers and school administrators are considered to be the primary source of data 
in such that they will be involved in the whole process of implementation of e-LMS, starting from 
requirement phase through implementation. During e-readiness, requirement and analysis survey as it has 
been evaluated by Kalinga et al., [9]; questioners, physical observation and focus group discussion with 
students, teachers and school administrators were employed. The visualization was on the reasons for poor 
performance, problems facing the current status of education system and the needs towards the 
performance improvement. The survey was the starting point on introducing and creating awareness of the 
whole issue of development of e-LMS for Tanzanian secondary schools.  
III. OBJECT ORIENTED SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN 
There are several approaches employed in system analysis and design. The most two commonly used 
approaches are: structured system analysis and design (SSA&D) and object oriented system analysis and 
design (OOSA&D).  
Davis (1983) [6] and [10] discuss that structured analysis prescribes analyzing and designing software 
system through functional decomposition. It examines an Information System in terms of the functions it 
performs and the data it uses and maintains. SSA&D identifies the major functions or processes of a 
system, then breaks or decomposes each function down into its smaller composite steps [6] [10]. On the 
other-side OOSA&D decomposes the system down into objects and examines how these objects act and 
interrelate. The analyst first identifies the object that comprise the system, then create an object model 
which groups the objects into classes, and describes each class in terms of its attributes (or data), methods 
(or functions) and relationships to other classes [22].  
OOSA&D approach will be employed in development of e-LMS. The main reason of this selection is 
that it employs UML as its documentation language. UML is also the one to be used in MDA. In software 
development successful information system are subject to frequent evaluation and revision within a 
framework known as System Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). The e-LMS is a system to be developed 
hence will abide to System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). SDLC for e-LMS will have: 
 requirement and analysis phase where use-case and conceptual diagrams will be used 
 
  105 
 
 design phase where sequence, collaboration, design class and component  diagrams will be used 
 implementation and testing phase where coding will be implemented 
IV. MODEL DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE 
The development of eLMS for Tanzania secondary schools will finally be implemented by customization 
of the selected open source LMS platform as per requirement and specifications of Tanzania environment. 
Selection of which open source platform to customize will be preceded with the creation of eLMS platform 
specific model. The reasons for choosing open source is discussed below, see section VI. 
Object Management Group (OMG) is promoting model driven Architecture (MDA) as a way to develop 
systems that more accurately satisfy customer’s needs and that offer more flexibility in system evolution 
(Brown, 2004) [2]. MDA improves requirement capture and system specification.  Unified Modeling 
Language (UML) is one among the technologies specified by OMG as a language to enable model driven 
approach. OMG in its UML specification version 1.5 [16] defines UML as a graphical language for 
visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. The 
UML offers a standard way to write a system's blueprints, including conceptual modeling. 
With the use of UML at its metamodel level, i.e. logical model level, several modeling graphics with 
different viewpoints will be created as a visual representation of the model. We found UML Modeling 
promote action research methodology by providing a basis for understanding the expected platform and 
promote a ready-to-use motion. 
V. CIM, PIM, PSM AND TRANSFORMATION 
MDA is a conceptual framework created by the OMG that separates business-oriented decisions from 
platform decisions to allow greater flexibility when architecting and evolving software development and 
deployment [2]. To support these principles, the OMG has defined a specific set of layers and 
transformation that provide a conceptual framework and vocabulary of MDA. These are Computation 
Independent Model (CIM), Platform Independent Model (PIM) and Platform Specific Model (PSM) [15] 
[2] [23] as shown in fig. 1. Along with conceptual framework, OMG through MDA also provides a set of 
standards to express models, model relationships and model-to-model transformations [2].

A. Computation Independent Model 
CIM for e-LMS will be based on the requirements and specification of the early survey for e-readiness 
status [9] conducted for Tanzania secondary schools. UML will be used to model the user requirements and 
their boundaries. The e-LMS has considered several users including students/learners, teachers/instructors, 
authors, school administrators, system administrators and officials from the concerned Ministry, here 
Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT). CIM also shows the e-LMS system architecture 
and standard specification to be employed. 
B. Platform Independent Model 
UML will model e-LMS at different viewpoint levels of abstractions from the platform independent 
viewpoint. This model will give what is being expected to be provided by e-LMS to Tanzania secondary 
schools.  At this stage the structure of the e-LMS database through design class diagram can be used to 
select the open source LMS platform. The model of that platform will enable implementation of a system 
with desired qualities and will promote the nature of mapping towards PSM, which is in this case a web 
services platform. 
C. Platform Specific Model 
The e-LMS is a web based platform in order to carter for wide access to a big number of rural secondary 
schools in different regions of Tanzania. The functionality specified in the PIM is realized in a PSM 
through the application of some transformation. Web services applications is our target in this case which 
will run in an application server. Web services application is the nature of transformation from PIM to 
PSM. The transformation from PIM into PSM will be to express the UML into XML Metadata Interchange 
(XMI) using standard definitions expressed as XML Schema Definitions (XSD) as shown in fig. 2.  
XMI is an application of Extensible Markup Language (XML), which lends itself to transporting 
information that is highly internally referential. XMI is applied to transport UML models by generating a 
special XSD through applying the rules of XMI to the concrete UML metamodel. The general mechanism 
applied within OMG to transport meta-information is XMI [17].  
Finally, PSM will be mapped to application using interfaces, code and Structured Query Language (SQL 
queries) adapted from open source LMS platforms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Model transformation is the process of converting one model to another model within the same system. 
The PIM and other information are combined to produce a PSM. To perform this UML extension 
mechanisms are used to both PIM and PSM. UML are extended with UML profiles by adding semantics 
information to the models transformation [17]. 
We can relate the phases in OOSA&D with the conceptual framework created by OMG in MDA as 
shown in figure 3. 
VI. CUSTOMIZATION OF OPEN SOURCE LMS PLATFORM 
Learning Management Systems (LMS) are specialized Learning Technology Systems (LTS) [7] [8], 
based on the state-of-the-art Internet and WWW technologies in order to provide education and training

following the open and distance learning paradigm. Moore et al., [13] and Carlson, [3] argue that the design 
and implementation of such systems is not an easy task, since they are complex systems that incorporate a 
variety of organizational, administrative, instructional and technological components. 
A Learning Management System is aimed at managing an e-learning environment, establishing the 
organization and delivery of content, administrating resources and tracking learning activities and results 
[5] [14]. LMS that are in use today are either commercial products (e.g. WebCT, Blackboard), or free open 
source products (e.g. moodle, claroline), or customized software systems that serve the instructional 
purposes of particular organizations. LMS that belong to the third category are exponentially increasing, as 
most education and training institutions are building or planning to build their own LMS. This is due to the 
fact that a customized LMS will fit better their specific learning purposes, and proves to give a good return 
of investment over the years [5].  
It is obvious that Tanzania secondary schools can not afford the cost of commercial learning 
management systems like, as well as get hold of a system optionally fitted in the specific context. The 
alternative means is to customize and use open source LMS. To ease e-LMS development process and to 
help generate a timely solution, existing open source LMS codes will be re-used. Most open source LMS 
could support the basic functions we need in developing e-LMS, but there was an obvious need for detailed 
customization. 
The drive of thinking on customization of open source platform is that open source software (OSS) is a 
software that is free in terms of its source code being available, as well as free in terms of purchase charges, 
and software licensing [18]. OSS source code is freely available to individuals to customize according to 
their own needs and distribute provided they abide by the accompanying license. This differs from 
commercial software which may only be obtained by some of payment; either by purchasing or by leasing. 
Open source software is based on open distribution of the source code that forms the software’s 
foundations. This means that any technically competent programmer can examine the inner working of the 
source code, make changes to the operation of the software and contribute the source to others.

VII. THE E-LMS DATABASE REPLICATION 
The e-LMS database for Tanzanian secondary schools is intended to be centrally placed at the University 
of Dar-es-Salaam, College of Engineering and Technology. The idea of keeping the database centrally is 
mainly due to easiness of administration and maintenance of it by expertise. In reality majority of users of 
the e-LMS database are geographically dispersed and they rely on the Internet connectivity to access the 
database. The application response time and the availability of the database will be subjected to the 
condition of the Internet. Yair et al., [25] argue that the centralized approach suffers from two major 
drawbacks: 
 Performance problems due to high server load or high communication latency for remote clients. 
 Availability problems caused by server downtime or lack of connectivity. Clients in portions of the 
network that are temporarily disconnected from the server cannot be serviced. 
 
Lack of connectivity due to several reasons like electrical power failure is the major problem in 
Tanzania. The server load and server downtime problems can be addressed by replicating the database 
servers to form a cluster of peer servers. There are many reasons why database replication is needed. 
Replication is generally for query load balancing, for disaster recovery (Restoration), for reducing latency, 
for bringing the data closer to the user, and for consolidating data from multiple sources. Because 
replication is based on the database logs it is very efficient in terms of performance compared with other 
methods of moving data [11]. Replication is an asynchronous, log-based process that permits copying of 
data from one location to another, keeping the data in the second location identical to the first [11]. 
Replication is a challenging issue since it involves much more than setup and there are not many sources 
of information for replication implementation and troubleshooting [19]. The challenge is on how to ensure 
database availability and meet end users needs. Fig. 4 shows the general replication outline. 
VIII. CONCLUSION 
Software design approach is applied simply to produce a software solution to a problem. To produce 
quality software we need to thorough understand the requirements that satisfy the user's needs. 
Visualization in the course of continuous improvement is a necessary basis for the participation of the 
personnel, and allows end-users to grasp the concept of operations of the system without having to 
understand software terminologies. 
A model is used for understanding a system properly before its actual implementation. Integration of the 
power of models as emphasized by OMG with software development lifecycle stages promotes description 
of a system from different viewpoints, each focusing on particular concerns. A viewpoint, applied to a 
system, gives a view of that system. Customization of open source LMS platforms can be used to develop a 
system which is optionally fitted in the specific context.
