Computer Science 
A.S. Degree 
IAI Recommended Curriculum 
 
Computer science majors encompass either a business and information systems 
emphasis or a technical emphasis. The information systems emphasis focuses on 
the use of computer technology and information management methods to solve 
business problems. This requires knowledge of both computer applications and the 
basics of business. The technical emphasis focuses on algorithms, theoretical 
foundations of computer science and development of software. A strong foundation in 
mathematics and science is needed for this emphasis. 
 
These course recommendations are intended for students who are undecided about a 
transfer school. Students who have selected a transfer school should consult the 
catalog of that school and an academic advisor for requirements appropriate to the first 
two years of study. College catalogs and transfer guides for many four year colleges are 
available in the Academic Advising Center. A pre- or co-requisite may be required for 
some courses.

Engineering 
A.S. Degree 
IAI Recommended Curriculum 
 
The engineer is concerned with the application of scientific principles to practical 
problems. There is a wide variety of specialties, but not all types are offered at all 
baccalaureate schools. A typical four-year curriculum provides a background of 
chemistry, mathematics and physics during the first two years, with the specialty 
courses occurring primarily in the last two years. These course recommendations are 
intended for students who are undecided about a transfer school. Students who have 
selected a transfer school should consult the catalog of that school and an academic 
advisor for requirements appropriate to the first two years of study. College catalogs 
and transfer guides for many four-year colleges are available in the Academic Advising 
Center.
