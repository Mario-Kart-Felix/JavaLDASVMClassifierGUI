1. Introduction
All organizations in different sectors of the industries should implement quality management 
practices to improve their performances. In order to prove that a quality management program 
is cost effective, it is necessary to identify and measure the quality costs in the system 
(Love,2000; Aoieong, 2002). However, very few companies  are interested in quality cost 
computations  to quantify the benefits of TQM, due to the great number and complexity of 
phases and / or activities involved in the operations.  In this study, it is notified that if a 
general approach in tracking and measuring quality costs in different fields of study is 
developed, companies will be encouraged to trace their quality management performances, 
decrease their costs of operations and increase overall profits. Hence, in this paper, a DBMS 
design  has been proposed which makes it possible to track deviations from ideal quality 
successfully and the cost of deviations per unit object in a quality management system. 
2. Quality Costs
All the costs associated with preventing, finding and correcting erroneous work and the 
forthcoming outcomes are the quality costs. Costs associated with failures resulting from 
inadequate systems may arise from internal and/or external sources (Crosby, 1979). If a defect 
or error is detected before a product leaves the organization whether in the intermediate stages 
or in the final state, the internal failure costs are incurred. As a result, operational costs in the 
organization or in other words, product / service costs arise due to the internal poor quality 
costs such as material waste, cost of rework, or any other avoidable process losses. On the 
contrary, if the errors or defects are found after the product leaves the company or if the 
product or service of the company is no longer under its’ control, external failure costs are 
incurred.  External failure costs include product warranties, sales returns and allowances and 
lost sales, service calls. The companies loose profit from the external poor quality due to loss 
of future business, contractual claims or rectifications needed. 
Companies incur appraisal and prevention costs not to incur internal and external failure 
costs.  Appraisal costs consist of all monies spent to measure the conformity of different items 
to the required specifications of quality.  Examples are cost of training associated with 
inspection, inspection and tests, maintaining test equipment etc. Prevention costs include any 
money spent in taking action to investigate, prevent or highly decrease the risk of 
nonconformity in production systems. Typical examples are cost of strengthening quality 
system design, machine or process capability studies, vendor surveys, employee training for 
production work or services etc.
In many cases, experimental data for the required quality cost computations are not available 
in organizations. The success of the evaluation process depends on the skills in combining all 
sources of data to reach practical results.  The database developed in this study can be used to 
provide the necessary data on quality costs as well as quality cost totals for quality 
management.
3. Quality Cost Database Management System Design
In the quality cost database management system design, the goal is to provide an interface 
which lets one to store the data of quality system and which makes it possible to do necessary 
calculations to check whether the money spent for this system is put to good use. When using 
this software, it is important to differentiate the tasks associated with the quality system from 
those involved in the production system. Since, the design focuses only on the activities 
associated with the quality system, i.e. prevention activities, appraisal activities, internal or 
external activities. In short, this differentiation simplifies the complexity of the data collection 
process since quality system is a subsystem of a production system.
The entity-relationship diagram developed modeling the quality cost database management 
system is given in Figure 1. The boxes represent entities and the arrows represent the 
relationships among entities. Tip and tail of the arrows show the relationship either as one-to-
many, zero to one or many to one. For example, there may be more than one “company” in 
entity “sector”. On the contrary, the entity “company” prevails only in one “sector”.

The first field “id” resembles the primary key for each entity. The foreign keys follow the 
primary ones in each file. The basic attributes of each entity are included into the conceptual 
model developed as code, name, description, etc. Integrity of the database has been normalized 
after specifying the relational schema. Data dictionary displaying the information about the 
size and type of each field is also given following each attribute in the E-R diagram.

To understand the results of quality cost study in the context of the production sectors for 
each company per product and also per production line, those classes as “Sector”, 
“Company”, “Product” and “Productline” are included into the DBMS design. ”Task” file has 
the attribute “task” which is associated with quality costs. “Quality-cost” file consists of 
primary attributes such as type of quality cost, quality cost value, and date the quality cost 
incurred. Sources of quality cost can also be included into the database.
The activity diagram given below (Fig.2) describes the workflow behind the system being 
designed. Object nodes are presented in the middle part of the diagram. Each node indicates 
an instance of a particular classifier in a particular state. Object flow in the diagram describes 
the flow of values to or from object values. 
This diagram shows how the application proceeds after the processing type is selected by the 
user. A new sector can be included into the sector data listed. Erasing a data or making 
changes on the data are also permitted. All types of processing operations used in object 
“sector” can also be used in the following objects in the hierarchical structure. As shown by 
the workflow diagram, each processing are based on similar patterns letting access between 
each level.
Figure 3 shows a repetitive part of the client / server multilayer architecture in an application. 
The structure of “sector” and “ company” classes and their interrelations in the object-oriented 
design are shown in the diagram. The aim of using this structure is to separate the processing 
logic controlled by server and application part used by client. JSF (Java server faces) pages 
presented in the server’s side and backbeans (java bean class) coming through JSF 
implementations out of them direct the processing operations each time an information and 
event are received from a user. In the server side, the received data are processed, recorded on 
the database and send back to the user with related interpretations. The end users are 
permitted to add, change, delete or retrieve data in the database.
Java object-oriented programming language has been chosen for the system development. 
Hence, the code can be used with network computers. In other words, the processing code and 
the data can be stored on a network server. The software functions developed can be 
downloaded via the network when needed. Then, after the processing ends, the data can be 
saved through the network.

Conclusions
The biggest advantage of the quality cost DBMS is to provide a new platform as a resource 
repository. It provides a framework for explaining and computing the quality costs. More 
importantly, the system could be enhanced to incorporate each of the elements of 
manufacturing and production information systems.
The system design developed offers the benefit of inserting different categories of quality 
related costs.  The design also offers a flexibility in coding different quality cost data. Lastly, 
the deviation between conformance and nonconformance costs will show the possibilities to 
decrease the total quality cost of production system.
