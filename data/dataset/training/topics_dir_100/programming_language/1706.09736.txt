ABSTRACT 
The importance of speaking style authentication from human speech is 
gaining an increasing attention and concern from the engineering community. 
The importance comes from the demand to enhance both the naturalness and 
efficiency of spoken language human-machine interface. Our work in this 
research focuses on proposing, implementing, and testing speaker-dependent and 
text-dependent speaking style authentication (verification) systems that accept or 
reject the identity claim of a speaking style based on suprasegmental hidden 
Markov models (SPHMMs). Based on using SPHMMs, our results show that the 
average speaking style authentication performance is: 99%, 37%, 85%, 60%, 
61%, 59%, 41%, 61%, and 57% belonging respectively to the speaking styles: 
neutral, shouted, slow, loud, soft, fast, angry, happy, and fearful. 
Keywords: decision threshold; hidden Markov models; speaking style 
authentication; suprasegmental hidden Markov models.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The goal of speech communication is to convey messages. 
Therefore, the message is the most important information embedded in 
Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Model0073 
University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 June 2008 42  
the speech signal. But it is not the only information. Other kinds of 
information embedded in the speech signal include the identity of the 
speaker, the language spoken, the age of the speaker, the gender of the 
speaker, the accent of the speaker, the presence and type of speech 
pathologies, and the physical and emotional state of the speaker. Of 
these other kinds of information, the identity of the speaker has received 
most of the attention [1-4]. On the other hand, the language spoken, the 
age of the speaker, the gender of the speaker, the accent of the speaker, 
the presence and type of speech pathologies, and the physical and 
emotional state of the speaker have not received enough attention [5-7]. 
Speaking style recognition systems can operate in either an 
identification or authentication decision mode. In the identification 
mode, a speech sample from the unknown speaking style is analyzed and 
compared with models of known speaking styles. The unknown 
speaking style is identified as the speaking style whose model best 
matches the input speech sample. In the authentication decision mode, 
the objective is to decide whether a speaking style corresponds to a 
particular known speaking style or to some other unknown speaking 
styles. A speaking style known to the speaking style recognition system 
that is correctly claiming its identity is called a true speaking style and 
the speaking style unknown to the system that is posing as a known 
speaking style is called a false speaking style. A known speaking style is 
also referred to as a target speaking style, while a false speaking style is 
referred to as a background speaking style. 
There are two types of errors in speaking style authentication 
systems: false acceptance, where a false speaking style is accepted, and 
false rejection, where a true speaking style is rejected. 
Speaking style authentication systems typically operate in one of 
two input modes, text-dependent mode or text-independent mode. In the 
text-dependent mode, speaking styles must provide utterances of the 
same text for both training and testing (authentication) trials. In the text-
independent mode, speaking styles are not constrained to provide 
Ismail Shahin ( 41- 65) 
June 2008 University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 43  
specific texts in authentication trials. The process of speaking style 
recognition can be divided into two categories: “open set” and “closed 
set”. In the “open set” category, a reference model for a test speaking 
style may not exist; whereas, in the “closed set” category, a reference 
model for a test speaking style must be available. 
2. MOTIVATION 
Speech is one of the important communication channels between a 
user and a computer and it can be used to recognize the speaking style 
status of the user. Speaking style recognition by speech is one of 
research fields for speaking style human-computer interaction or 
affective computing [8]. A major motivation comes from the desire to 
develop human-machine interface that is more adaptive and responsive 
to a user’s behavior. The main task of intelligent human-machine 
interaction is to empower a computer with the affective computing 
ability so that a computer can recognize the speaking style of the user 
and then respond to the user in an affective method. 
The applications of speaking style recognition systems are many. 
Speaking style recognition systems can be used in the applications of 
telecommunications, military field, and law enforcement. In 
telecommunications, speaking style recognition systems can be used to 
enhance the telephone-based speech recognition performance, route 
emergency call services for high precedence emergency calls, and assess 
a caller’s speaking style for telephone response services. The integration 
of speech recognition technology is noticeable in many military voice 
communication and control applications. Such applications involve 
stressful environments such as aircraft cockpits and military 
peacekeeping [9]. Finally, speaking style recognition systems can be 
employed in forensic speech analysis by law enforcement to assess the 
state of telephone callers or as an aid in suspect interviews. 
Researchers are incorporating emotional and stressful capabilities into 
speech synthesis programs, hoping to empower computers that can 
communicate emotionally and stressfully with users through expressive 
Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Model0073 
University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 June 2008 44  
vocal signals such as laughter, sighing, or sad tones of voice. IBM is set to 
release a new Expressive Text-to-Speech Engine for commercial use that 
will deliver spoken information in the appropriate tone (sadness, happiness, 
frustration, etc…). AT&T Lab is developing the opposite technology, 
software that can detect users’ emotional and stressful state; voice-response 
systems equipped with this software would be able to prioritize calls 
according to the person’s state of agitation, for example [10]. 
In the last four decades, all the attentions and concerns have been 
focused on speech recognition and speaker recognition areas. Researchers 
focus their work on these two areas under the neutral and stressful 
speaking styles [1,2,11,12]. On the other hand, the area of speaking style 
recognition does not receive enough attention [6,7,13,14]. Dealing with 
the area of speaking style recognition is one of the latest challenges in 
speech technologies. Three different aspects can be easily identified in the 
area of speaking styles: speech recognition in the presence of speaking 
styles, synthesis of speaking styles, and speaking style recognition [13]. 
Lee and Narayanan focused their work on recognizing emotions from 
spoken language [6]. In their work, Lee and Narayanan used a 
combination of three sources of information for emotion recognition. The 
three sources are: acoustic, lexical, and discourse. Li and Zhao worked on 
recognizing emotions in speech using short-term and long-term features 
[15]. Wu et al. focused their work on studying the influence of emotion on 
the performance of a GMM-UBM based speaker verification system [16]. 
In their work, they proposed an emotion-dependent score normalization 
for speaker verification on emotional speech. 
Our work in this paper focuses on the process of accepting or 
rejecting the identity claim of a speaking style of speaker-dependent and 
text-dependent speaking style authentication systems based on SPHMMs. 
This is the first known work that focuses on speaking style authentication 
systems based on SPHMMs. Our speaking styles in this work are: neutral, 
shouted, slow, loud, soft, fast, angry, happy, and fearful. 
Speaker-dependent and text-dependent speaking style authentication 
systems are currently being developed with the aim of enhancing the 
Ismail Shahin ( 41- 65) 
June 2008 University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 45  
quality of human-computer interaction. The authentication of the 
speaking style user state (speaker-dependent) seems often essential to 
verify the true meaning (text-dependent) of what has been said or to 
adapt the computer’s behavior to the user’s speaking styles. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 3 explains briefly 
speaking styles. Section 4 discusses suprasegmental hidden Markov 
models. Section 5 describes the speech database used. Section 6 discusses 
the algorithm of speaking style authentication systems based on each of 
hidden Markov models (HMMs) and SPHMMs. Results and discussion 
appear in Section 7. Concluding remarks are listed in Section 8. 
3. SPEAKING STYLES 
Neutral speaking style can be defined as the speaking style in which 
speech is produced assuming that the speaker is in a “quiet room” with 
no task obligations. Speaking styles other than the neutral speaking style 
are defined as speaking styles that cause a speaker to vary his/her 
production of speech from the neutral speaking style. 
Researchers in the areas of speech recognition, speaker recognition, 
and speaking style recognition use speech database to test their proposed 
algorithm. There are many speech databases that are available to 
researchers in the three areas. Ververidis and Kotropoulos reviewed 32 
speaking style and emotional speech databases [17]. Each database 
consists of a corpus of human speech uttered under different speaking 
styles and emotional states. 
One of the most famous speech databases is the SUSAS (Speech 
Under Simulated and Actual Stress) database [18]. This database was 
established to conduct research studies for analysis and algorithm 
formulation of speech recognition and speaker recognition in stressful 
and noisy environment. This database can also be used in the area of 
speaking style recognition. Hansen, Cummings, and Clements used the 
SUSAS speech database in which eight talking conditions are used to 
Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Model0073 
University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 June 2008 46  
simulate speech produced under real stressful talking conditions and 
three real talking conditions [11,12,19]. 
4. SUPRASEGMENTAL HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS 
HMMs have been successfully used in the fields of speech 
recognition and speaker recognition applications in the last three 
decades. HMMs have become one of the most successful and broadly 
used modeling techniques in the two fields [3,20,21]. Remarkably, 
robust models of speech events can be obtained with only small amounts 
of specification or information accompanying training utterances. In 
HMMs, formulation the speech signal is considered as a sequence of 
Markov states representing transitions from one speech event to another. 
The Markov states themselves are “hidden” but are indirectly observable 
from the sequences of spectral feature vectors. 
HMMs are powerful models in optimizing the parameters that are 
used in modeling speech signals. This optimization decreases the 
computational complexity in the decoding procedure and improves the 
recognition accuracy [21]. HMMs use Markov chain to model the 
changing statistical characteristics that exist in the actual observations of 
speech signals. HMMs are double stochastic processes where there is an 
unobservable Markov chain defined by a state transition matrix, and 
where each state of the Markov chain is associated with either a discrete 
output probability distribution (discrete HMMs) or a continuous output 
probability density function (continuous HMMs) [21]. 
A suprasegmental is a vocal effect that extends over more than one 
sound segment in an utterance, such as pitch, stress, or juncture pattern. 
Suprasegmental is often used for tone, vowel length, and features like 
nasalization and aspiration. Stress, tone, intonation, length, and 
organization of segments into syllables are usually considered 
suprasegmental properties. 
The ability and capability of SPHMMs appear clearly in 
summarizing several states with HMMs into what is termed a 
Ismail Shahin ( 41- 65) 
June 2008 University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 47  
suprasegmental state. Suprasegmental states are able and capable of 
looking at the observation sequence through a larger window to capture 
prosodic properties. Such states allow observations at rates appropriate 
for the situation of speaking style modeling. For example, prosodic 
information can not be observed at a rate that is used to model the 
acoustic features of speech signals. Fundamental frequency, intensity, 
and duration of speech signals are the main acoustic parameters that 
describe prosody [22]. 
In linguistics, prosody is the intonation, rhythm, and lexical stress in 
speech. The prosodic features of a unit of speech are called 
suprasegmental features because they affect all the segments of the unit. 
These features are manifested, among other things, as syllable length, 
tone, and stress. Prosodic information can be applied to phrases, words, 
syllables, and phones which of course can not be observed in the time 
frame in which acoustic information can be observed. Hence, prosodic 
events are modeled using suprasegmental states, while acoustic events 
are modeled using conventional hidden Markov states. 
Lea proposed the use of prosodic information in Automatic Speech 
Understanding (ASU) systems [23]. Seventeen years later, a German 
speech-to-speech translation system called VERBMOBIL was 
completed as the world wide first complete speech understanding 
system, where prosody was really used. It was shown by the 
VERBMOBIL system that the used and implemented prosody yielded 
drastic performance improvement. 
The basic structure of SPHMMs is given (as an example) in Fig. 1. 
q1, q2, …,q6 are hidden Markov states. p1 is a suprasegmental state (e.g. 
phone) that is composed of q1, q2, and q3. p2 is a suprasegmental state 
(e.g. phone) that is composed of q4, q5, and q6. p3 is a suprasegmental 
state (e.g. syllable) that is made up of p1 and p2. aij is the transition 
probability between the ith hidden Markov state and the jth hidden 
Markov state. bij is the transition probability between the ith 
suprasegmental state and the jth suprasegmental state.

5. SPEECH DATABASE 
Our speaking style speech corpus was collected from 20 untrained 
healthy adult native speakers of American English (10 males and 10 
females). Untrained speakers were selected to avoid exaggerated 
expressions. Each speaker uttered 8 sentences where each sentence was 
uttered 9 times (9 utterances or tokens per sentence) under each of the 
neutral, shouted, slow, loud, soft, fast, angry, happy, and fearful 
speaking styles. In addition, we asked the 20 speakers to utter the 8 
sentences for a sad speaking style. 
The 8 sentences were unbiased towards any speaking style (no 
correlation between any sentence and any speaking style). These 
sentences were:

Our speech database was recorded in a clean environment that was not 
affected by background noise. The speech database was captured by a 
speech acquisition board using a 16-bit linear coding A/D converter and 
sampled at a sampling rate of 16 kHz. Our database was a wideband 16-bit 
per sample linear data. The signal samples were segmented into frames of 
16 ms each with 9 ms overlap between consecutive frames. The total 
number of frames to be processed depends on the length of the utterance. 
The speech signals were then applied to the Hamming window. Next, 16
th
 
order linear prediction coefficients (LPCs) were extracted from each frame 
by the autocorrelation method. The 16
th
 order LPCs were then transformed 
into 16
th
 order Linear Prediction Cepstral Coefficients (LPCCs). 
The LPCC feature analysis was used to form the observation vectors 
in each of HMMs and SPHMMs. In HMMs, the number of states, N, 
was 5 and the number of mixture components, M, was 5 per state. In 
SPHMMs, the number of suprasegmental states was 2 (p1 and p2, where 
p1 was composed of 3 hidden Markov states: q1, q2, and q3, while p2 was 
composed of 2 hidden Markov states: q4 and q5) and the number of 
mixture components was 5 per state. A continuous mixture observation 
density was selected for each of HMMs and SPHMMs.

Speaking style authentication problem in each of HMMs and 
SPHMMs requires making a binary decision based on two hypotheses. 
Hypothesis H0 if a test speaking style belongs to a true speaking style 
(claimant) or hypothesis H1 if a test speaking style comes from a false 
speaking style (imposter). 
 Talking Condition Authentication Based on HMMs 
In the training session of the conventional HMMs, one reference model 
per speaker per sentence per speaking style was derived using 5 of the 9 
utterances. The total number of utterances in this session was 7200. 
Training of models in this session used the forward-backward algorithm. 
In the testing (authentication) session, all the nine speaking styles 
were used in addition to the sad speaking style since our speech database 
was an open set. In this session, each one of the 10 speaking styles used

the 9 utterances of the sad speaking style were not used). The total 
number of utterances in this session was 6400. The authentication 
process in this session used the Viterbi decoding algorithm.

 Speaking Style Authentication Based on SPHMMs 
In the training session of SPHMMs, the training process was very 
similar to the training process of conventional HMMs. In the training 
session of SPHMMs, suprasegmental models were trained on top of 
acoustic models. In this session, one reference model per speaker per 
sentence per speaking style was derived using 5 of the 9 utterances. The 
testing session of SPHMMs is the same as the testing session of HMMs. 
Based on SPHMMs, the log-likelihood ratio can be defined as,

In equations (1) and (2), the log-likelihood ratio depends on the 
probability that a test speaking style comes from a true speaking style and 
the probability that a test speaking style comes from a false speaking style 
based on HMMs and SPHMMs, respectively. There are three scenarios to 
determine the log-likelihood ratio. These three scenarios are: 
Scenario 1: The probability that a test speaking style utterance does 
not come from the claimant speaking style is determined from a set of 
imposter speaking style models: 
K21 CCC
λ,...,λ,λ , where K is the number 
of imposter speaking style models. In this scenario, the imposter 
speaking style model, C , is obtained from these individual models. 
Scenario 2: The claimant log-probability score is computed first and 
then the maximum of the imposter scores over individual imposter models 
is subtracted from the claimant log-probability score for the HMMs and 
SPHMMs as given in the following two formulae, respectively, 
      )3(λOPmaxλOP(O)Λ

where iC  is the ith individual imposter model. 
      )4(OPmaxOP(O)Λ

score. In this work, we adopted this scenario for simplicity. Therefore, 
the threshold is sensitive to the probability that a test speaking style 
comes from a true speaking style. 
To assign an appropriate value of threshold to our authentication 
system based on each of HMMs and SPHMMs, this value of threshold 
should be able to tolerate trial-to-trial variations and at the same time yields 
a desired level of performance. A tight value of threshold makes it difficult 
Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Model0073 
University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 June 2008 54  
for false speaking styles to be falsely accepted but at the expense of falsely 
rejecting true speaking styles. On the other hand, a loose value of threshold 
enables true speaking styles to be accepted constantly at the expense of 
falsely accepting false speaking styles. In order to set an appropriate value 
of threshold that satisfies a desired level of a true speaking style rejection 
and a false speaking style acceptance, it is necessary to know the 
distribution of true speaking style and false speaking style scores. A 
reasonable procedure for setting a value of threshold is to assign a loose 
initial value of threshold and then let it adapt by setting it to the average of 
recent trial scores. This loose value of threshold provides inadequate 
protection against false speaking style attempts. 
In each of HMMs and SPHMMs, an input utterance from a test 
speaking style was analyzed to extract speaking style characteristic features. 
The measured features were compared with prototype features obtained 
from known speaking style models. In the speaking style identification 
mode, the comparison was carried out with every speaking style model 
(there are n comparisons or tests for n speaking styles). In the speaking style 
authentication mode, the comparison was carried out only with the model 
corresponding to the claimed speaking style identity (there is one 
comparison or test for a given unknown speaking style). In the speaking 
style authentication systems, an identity claim is made by or asserted for the 
unknown speaking style. The speech sample of the unknown speaking style 
is compared with the model for the speaking style whose identity is 
claimed. In such systems, there are two decision alternatives, accept or 
reject the identity claim, regardless of the size of the speaking styles. 
7. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Our work in this research focused on verifying speaker-dependent 
and text-dependent speaking styles from spoken English language based 
on SPHMMs. We compare our results based on SPHMMs as shown in 
Table 1 with that based on HMMs as shown in Table 2. It is evident 
from Table 1 and Table 2 that SPHMMs are superior models over 
HMMs for speaking style authentication systems. The average speaking 
Ismail Shahin ( 41- 65) 
June 2008 University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 55  
style authentication performance based on HMMs is 57.7%; on the other 
hand, the average speaking style authentication performance based on 
SPHMMs is 62.2%. The improvement rate of using SPHMMs over 
HMMs is 7.8%. This may be attributed to the following reasons: 
1. SPHMMs are suitable and sufficient models to integrate 
observations from different modalities because such models allow for 
observations at a rate appropriate for each modality. On the other hand, 
HMMs are inappropriate and insufficient models to integrate observations 
from different modalities because such models are not capable for 
observations at a rate appropriate for each modality. This is because 
suprasegmental states allow observations at rates appropriate for the 
phenomena they are intended to model. This property of suprasegmental 
states is not possessed by hidden Markov states. In a work done by Polzin 
and Waibel, suprasegmental hidden Markov models yield better emotional 
detection accuracy than hidden Markov models [25]. 
2. Prosodic information adds more discriminative power to the 
speaking style authentication systems than the acoustic information.

Table 1 shows evidently that the neutral speaking style authentication 
performance of a test speaking style that belongs to a true speaking style 
(H0) is 99% and the neutral speaking style authentication performance of a 
test speaking style that comes from a false speaking style (H1) is 1%. The 
improvement rate of using SPHMMs over HMMs under such a speaking 
style is 0%. This means that both SPHMMs and HMMs are efficient and 
sufficient models under the neutral speaking style. 
Table 3 and Table 4 show confusion matrices based on SPHMMs 
and HMMs, respectively. The two tables represent the percentage of 
confusion of a test speaking style with the other speaking styles based on 
SPHMMs and HMMs, respectively. These two tables show the following:

1. The most easily recognizable speaking style is neutral. Hence, the 
performance of verifying the neutral speaking style is the highest compared 
to verifying the other speaking styles as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. 
2. The second most easily recognizable speaking style is slow. 
Therefore, the performance of verifying the slow speaking style is the 
second highest compared to the performance of the other speaking styles 
as shown in Table 1 and Table 2. 
3. The least easily recognizable speaking style is shouted. 
Consequently, the least speaking style verification performance occurs when 
the test speaking style is shouted as shown clearly in Table 1 and Table 2.

4. Column 3 of Table 3, for example, shows that based on 
SPHMMs 0% of the utterances that were portrayed as shouted speaking 
style were evaluated as neutral, slow, soft, and happy speaking styles 
(the proximity between the shouted and each of the neutral, slow, soft, 
and happy is zero), 28% of the utterances that were portrayed as shouted 
speaking style were evaluated as loud speaking style. This column 
shows that the shouted speaking style has the highest confusion 
percentage with the loud speaking style (28%) and with the angry 
speaking style (23%). Therefore, the shouted speaking style is highly 
confusable with each of the loud and angry speaking styles.

5. Table 3 and Table 4 show evidently why SPHMMs outperform 
HMMs for speaking style authentication systems. 
It is evident from Table 1 that the least speaking style authentication 
performance occurs under the shouted speaking style. The reason for this 
sharply degraded authentication performance is that the shouted 
speaking style is considered as the most stressful speaking style [3]. It is 
apparent from Table 1 and Table 2 that HMMs yield lower 
authentication performance than SPHMMs under such a speaking style. 
In fact, HMMs are inefficient and insufficient models under the shouted 
speaking style because the changes in the statistical characteristics that 
exist in the actual observations of the shouted speaking style are greater 
than those of the neutral speaking style. This sharply degraded 
authentication performance comes from the fact that the log-likelihood 
ratio is much less than the threshold. The reason of this low log-
likelihood ratio is that the probability that a test speaking style comes 
from a true speaking style and the probability that a test speaking style 
comes from a false speaking style are very close. It was reported in 
many other studies that HMMs did not perform well under such a 
speaking style [1-3]. The improvement rate of using SPHMMs over 
HMMs under such a speaking style is very significant (15.6%). Table 4 
shows that the shouted speaking style is highly confusable with each of 
the loud and angry speaking styles. This high proximity between the 
shouted speaking style and each of the loud and angry speaking styles 
explains the degraded shouted speaking style verification performance. 
Table 1 shows that the slow speaking style authentication 
performance is quite high compared to the other speaking styles. This is 
because the slow speaking style is rarely confusable with other speaking 
styles as shown clearly in Table 3 and Table 4. Table 2 shows that 
HMMs are convenient models for such a speaking style. This is because 
the talking rate under the slow speaking style is low. Low talking rate 
results in a sufficient number of frames per state in HMMs. Therefore, 
HMMs represent slow speaking style speech signals efficiently and 
conveniently. Table 1 and Table 2 show that SPHMMs noticeably 
enhance the authentication performance compared to HMMs. 
Ismail Shahin ( 41- 65) 
June 2008 University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 59  
The loud speaking style authentication performance is quite low. 
Comparing the loud speaking style authentication performance with that 
of the shouted speaking style, it is clear that the loud speaking style 
authentication performance is almost twice as that for the shouted 
speaking style. This is because the shouted speaking style consists of 
two components: loud speaking style and noise [26]. The improvement 
rate of using SPHMMs over HMMs under such a speaking style is 
significant (9.1%). Table 3 and Table 4 show that this speaking style is 
highly confusable with the shouted speaking style. 
The soft speaking style authentication performance is low. This is 
because the soft speaking style approaches breathy or whispering 
speaking style which means that the speaking style authentication 
system will not be able to verify correctly when a test speaking style is 
soft. It is difficult for speaking style authentication system to verify 
correctly breathy or whispering speech signals. 
Table 1 clearly shows that the fast speaking style authentication 
performance based on SPHMMs is improved remarkably compared to that 
based on HMMs; the improvement rate of using SPHMMs over HMMs is 
11%. This is because suprasegmental states have the ability and capability 
to look at the observation sequence through a larger window. Such states 
allow observations at rates suitable for the situation of modeling. 
The angry speaking style authentication performance is very low. 
The authentication performance for this speaking style is the second 
lowest authentication performance based on each of SPHMMs and 
HMMs. The authentication performance of each the shouted and angry 
speaking styles is close to each other since the shouted speaking style 
can not be entirely separated from the angry speaking style in our real 
life [1]. It is obvious from the two confusion matrices that the angry 
speaking style is highly confusable with the shouted speaking style. 
Based on SPHMMs, the happy speaking style authentication 
performance is quite low. This is because when people talk under joy 
and happiness, they do not usually talk clearly. Consequently, there will 
Speaking Style Authentication Using Suprasegmental Hidden Markov Model0073 
University of Sharjah Journal of Pure & Applied Sciences Volume 5, No. 2 June 2008 60  
be confusion and ambiguity in their speech. The confusion happens 
between the happy speaking style and each of the loud and fast speaking 
styles. The improvement rate of using SPHMMs over HMMs under such 
a speaking style is significant (10.9%). 
The fearful speaking style authentication performance is worse than 
that of the happy speaking style. This is because when people talk under 
the fearful and frightened mode, they produce speech with more 
ambiguity and less clarity than that under the happy mode. The fearful 
speaking style has a remarkable confusion with each of the slow, soft, 
and angry speaking styles. The improvement rate of using SPHMMs 
over HMMs under such a speaking style is significant (11.8%). 
It is noticeable from Table 1 that for all of the speaking styles 
(except for the fast speaking style), the speaking style authentication 
performance based on SPHMMs for the female speakers is higher than 
that for the male speakers. This is because as shown from Table 5 and 
Table 6 that the confusion percentage of a female test speaking style 
with the other female speaking styles is less than that for a male test 
speaking style. It seems that SPHMMs add more discriminative power to 
the female speaking styles than that to the male speaking styles.

A new method called multi-speaker training method has been 
proposed and implemented to enhance speaking style authentication 
performance. Multi-speaker training method requires a speaker to train 
an authentication system using speaking styles spoken by different 
speakers instead of using speaking styles all spoken by the same speaker.

Two different experiments on multi-speaker trained speaking style 
authentication systems have been performed. One experiment trained 
based on SPHMMs and the other one trained based on HMMs. In each 
experiment, for each speaking style, a multi-speaker trained model added 
one utterance from each speaker per sentence to the previous training set 
taking into considerations that none of the test utterances are used for 
training. Table 7 and Table 8 summarize the results of speaking style 
authentication performance using the multi-speaker training method 
based on SPHMMs and HMMs, respectively. 
Comparing Table 7 with Table 8, it is evident that the speaking style 
authentication performance based on the multi-speaker SPHMMs training 
method has been significantly improved compared to that based on the 
multi-speaker HMMs training method. This significant enhancement of 
using the multi-speaker SPHMMs training method over the multi-speaker 
HMMs training method shows evidently that SPHMMs are superior models 
over HMMs for speaking style authentication systems.

8. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Our work in this research focused on enhancing speaker-dependent 
and text-dependent speaking style authentication systems based on 
SPHMMs. Generally speaking, speaking style authentication systems are 
not straightforward systems. The field of human speaking styles is an 
enormously complicated field of study. This may be attributed to a 
number of considerations:

1) Voice quality is intrasegmental since it is dependent on each 
individual vocal tract.

2) Speaking style authentication systems depend on many areas such 
as signal processing and analysis techniques, psychology, physiology, and 
linguistics. Therefore, it is recommended to include these areas for any 
future work that is related to the speaking style recognition. 
3) There is a lack of complete understanding and knowledge of 
speaking styles in human minds, including a lack of agreement among 
psychologists. 
4) Speakers usually use certain words more frequently in expressing 
their speaking styles since they have learned the connection between 
certain words and their corresponding speaking styles. This issue is 
studied thoroughly in the field of psychology [27]. For example, people 
under the happy mode frequently use the words: yes, agree, correct, 
good, etc…; on the other hand, people under the angry mode use 
frequently the words: no, disagree, wrong, bad, etc…
