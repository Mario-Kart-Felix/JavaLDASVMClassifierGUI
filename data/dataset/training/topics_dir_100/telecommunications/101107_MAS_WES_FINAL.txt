Proposal for a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) Degree in Wireless Embedded Systems 
– Preamble 
 
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), in conjunction with Department 
of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), proposes a new Master of Advanced Studies 
(MAS) in “Wireless Embedded Systems” (WES). This program targets industry professionals in 
markets that involve wireless communications and embedded systems through a combined ECE 
and CSE graduate curriculum. Students who enroll in this program will have a background in 
computer science and/or electrical engineering.  
 
Mobile telephony has reached roughly three billion people in the world today, and 
approximately one billion cellular telephones are sold each year - more than thirty a second. 
UCSD has established a dominant position in education and research in this field, and is widely 
recognized as the leading “wireless” research University in the United States. It is home to the 
Center for Wireless Communications and the Center for Networked Systems, which are 
supported by leading industries in the wireless field.   
 
The next step in this wireless revolution is the interconnection of everyday devices 
through wireless technology (so-called “embedded wireless”). This market is expected to 
explode in the next decade. An embedded wireless device is a piece of electronic hardware with 
integrated software dedicated to perform a particular task, which connects wirelessly to the 
internet and may require very powerful processors.  
 
Since the embedded device is dedicated to a specific task, its size, cost, reliability and 
performance need to be optimized.  Embedded systems range from portable devices such as 
digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic lights, factory 
controllers, or the systems controlling nuclear power plants. In the future, we expect all of these 
devices to be interconnected wirelessly.  
 
The engineering skill set required to develop these new devices fundamentally spans the 
disciplines of Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical and Computer Engineering.  As 
a result, a new approach to education needs to be considered when developing a program for 
professionals working in this field.  And given the emergence of this new discipline, there is a 
strong need for a targeted high-quality program aimed at high-level training of professional 
engineers.  
 
The UCSD MAS is designed to be a “Professional Master’s degree,” addressing the 
needs of students on an industrial or government career track, rather than a research track, with a 
focus on innovating new uses of existing technologies as opposed to  inventing new 
technologies.  The UCSD MAS in Wireless Embedded Systems will build on our historic 
strengths in the ECE and CSE Departments. Specifically, we have a substantial legacy in the 
Wireless and Embedded Systems areas, in terms of faculty, course offerings and industry 
contacts. In addition, we intend for this professional degree to impart the knowledge and skills 
that will serve the students well in a career in engineering design and engineering management.

1  INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1 Aims and objectives of the program 
 
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), in conjunction with Department 
of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), proposes a new Master of Advanced Studies 
(MAS) in “Wireless Embedded Systems” (WES). This program targets industry professionals in 
markets that involve wireless communications and embedded systems through a combined ECE 
and CSE graduate curriculum. Students who enroll in this program will have a background in 
computer science and/or electrical engineering.  
 
1.2 Historical development of the field 
 
Mobile telephony has reached roughly three billion people in the world today, and approximately 
one billion cellular telephones are sold each year - more than thirty a second. UCSD has 
established a dominant position in education and research in this field, and is widely recognized 
as the leading “wireless” research University in the United States. It is home to the Center for 
Wireless Communications and the Center for Networked Systems, which are supported by 
leading industries in the wireless field.  There are many innovations that have resulted from 
research at UCSD that have enabled the preeminence and growth of the wireless industry in the 
region. 
 
The next step in this wireless revolution is the interconnection of everyday devices through 
wireless technology. This market is expected to explode in the next decade. For example, at this 
year’s Mobile World Congress, Ericsson CEO Hans Vestberg said that his company predicts that 
there will be 50 billion wirelessly connected devices by 2020. Vestberg added that these 
embedded devices will be used for communications with both machine-to-machine applications 
and consumer devices. 
 
An embedded wireless device is a piece of electronic hardware with integrated software 
dedicated to perform a particular task, which connects wirelessly to the internet and may require 
very powerful processors. A recent high-profile example is the Amazon Kindle, which 
downloads books in seconds through a wireless network.  
 
Since the embedded device is dedicated to a specific task, its size, cost, reliability and 
performance need to be optimized.  Embedded systems range from portable devices such as 
digital watches and MP3 players, to large stationary installations like traffic lights, factory 
controllers, or the systems controlling nuclear power plants. Complexity varies from low, with a 
single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks mounted 
inside a large chassis or enclosure. In the future, we expect all of these devices to be 
interconnected wirelessly.  
 
Embedded wireless devices have some unique requirements. Their form factor, cost and power 
consumption must be dramatically smaller than existing cellular phones, yet with almost all the 
 5
functionality of a complete phone! The engineering skill set required to develop these new 
devices fundamentally spans the disciplines of Computer Science and Engineering and Electrical 
and Computer Engineering.  As a result, a new approach to education needs to be considered 
when developing a program for professionals working in this field.  And given the emergence of 
this new discipline, there is a strong need for a targeted high-quality program aimed at high-level 
training of professional engineers.  
 
The MAS is designed to be a “Professional Master’s degree,” addressing the needs of students on 
an industrial or government career track, rather than a research track, with a focus on innovating 
new uses of existing technologies as opposed to  inventing new technologies.  
 
Our plan for the Professional MAS has been influenced by a variety of considerations: 
 
• The UCSD MAS in Wireless Embedded Systems will build on our historic strengths in the 
ECE and CSE Departments. Specifically, we have a substantial legacy in the Wireless and 
Embedded Systems areas, in terms of faculty, course offerings and industry contacts. 
 
• A professional degree should impart knowledge and skills that will serve the students well in a 
career in engineering design and engineering management. 
 
• Our plan builds on a comprehensive set of existing courses that will provide the foundation 
curriculum for this specialization.  
  
1.3 Timetable for Development of the Program 
 
We anticipate that this program will begin in the Fall of 2011 with an enrollment of 10-20 new 
students during the first year and with  20-30 new students per year at steady-state.   
 
1.4 Relationships of the program to existing programs 
 
The program is unique and there are no existing programs that we are aware of like that proposed 
at UCSD. There are several other MAS programs at UCSD. However, none of them are in the 
field of Wireless Embedded Systems, or Wireless Communications, or Embedded Systems. We 
currently have existing MS programs focused on wireless communications (in the ECE 
Department) and in embedded systems (in the CSE Department) but there is no program that 
spans both these areas, and neither of these programs is geared towards the working professional. 
The recently approved MAS in AESE is an example of a similar Professional MAS degree 
within the Jacobs School of Engineering at UCSD.   
 
1.5 Interrelationship of the program with other UC Institutions 
 
There is no interrelationship with other UC Institutions. 
 6
1.6 Department or group which will administer the program. 
 
We propose that the degree program be a joint degree, either from the Department of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering degree or the Department of Computer Science and 
Engineering (at the discretion of the student). In this sense, the joint program will be very similar to 
the already existing UCSD Computer Engineering undergraduate program, which is jointly offered 
between the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science and 
Engineering.  
 
At the same time, the pedagogical direction of the program, admission decisions, outreach to 
industry, financial decision making, and strategy for student advising, will be guided by a five-
member steering committee. The steering committee will consist of two members from each 
Department and a Program Director (appointed by the Dean of the Jacobs School of 
Engineering).  The composition of this steering committee, and its role in the administration of 
the program, are described later in this proposal.  
 
 
1.7 Plan for evaluation of the program within the offering department(s) & campus-wide. 
 
At the end of each course, enrollees will rate their experience on a number of dimensions.  
Standardized feedback instruments will be used to assess the responses.  Enrollees will provide 
feedback on aspects of the course, including the curriculum, the faculty, the learning resources 
that were recommended or made available, and the practical experience provided by projects or 
assignments.  Appropriate changes will be recommended to improve the program to see that 
learning objectives of the program are met.  Faculty will be evaluated based on student course 
evaluations and overall engagement and participation in the program. 
 
A written survey of students’ thoughts and professional activities related to the program will be 
conducted upon graduation each year.  The compilation of these responses will provide input 
into the review process and will aid in the evaluation of the merit of the program.  
 
Since the ultimate goal of the program is to improve its students’ performance in their 
professions, an important aspect of assessments will be whether the students can apply the 
knowledge and skills they have learned.  The fundamental measure in making these assessments 
is provided by the capstone project. Periodic alumni surveys following graduation will also be 
considered. Information from these surveys will be reviewed to assess the impact of the program.  
As with all MAS programs, the Academic Senate will review the program on an 8 year cycle as 
per Senate requirements. 
 
2 PROGRAM  
2.1 Requirements 
 
The MAS in Wireless Embedded Systems is directed to students who are engineers and 
engineering professionals. Because prospective students are expected to be full-time working 
 7
professionals, the lecture-style courses will be offered in the evenings and on weekends.  As a 
result, we anticipate that the MAS versions of these courses will be taught as separate sections. 
 
Admissions requirements are equivalent to Master of Science programs in ECE and CSE except 
that work experience may be substituted for GRE test scores. Admission requirements are as 
follows: 
 
(i) Bachelor’s degree in engineering, mathematics, or physics 
(ii) Undergraduate GPA of at least 3.0 
(iii) 2 years work experience (in lieu of GRE) 
(iv) Three letters of recommendation, one of which must be from the applicant’s current 
employer.  For those who are unemployed, this requirement may be waived. 
(v) TOEFL or TSE (international applicants only) 
 
The proposed admission criteria are the same as those for the recently approved MAS in AESE – 
administered by the CSE Department. The GPA requirements are the same as for those for admission 
to our regular MS program. The GRE requirement, which is typical for our MS program, is waived 
for the MAS. But we substitute significant work experience as a requirement for admission to the 
MAS program, which provides an alternative quality assessment mechanism. Waiving the GRE 
requirement is a standard feature of existing MAS programs. On example is the UCSD IRPS MAS-
IA program (http://irps.ucsd.edu), which has identical requirements to the proposed MAS-WES 
proposal.  
 
The MAS degree is intended for people who have taken a hiatus from academic pursuits, and so 
require extra time and support to achieve high-level results. Admission to the program will be very 
rigorous, but the criteria will be different from those of an MS student. 
 
2.2 Foreign Language 
 
Foreign language is not required for this degree. 
2.3 Program of Study 
 
The burgeoning discipline of Wireless Embedded Systems (WES) is focused on methodologies 
and tools to develop next-generation wireless embedded systems. The proposed Professional 
MAS in WES is concerned with educating students at the intersection of a variety of multi-
disciplinary engineering skills. Because the field of WES is still maturing, this program will 
provide students with the opportunity for a state-of-the art interdisciplinary engineering 
education as well as a rich area for significant and heretofore largely unexplored challenges. The 
expected result will be the development and maturation of a much needed engineering discipline 
that will address the upcoming technical challenges of this century. 
 
The program of study for this degree arises from a core foundation of wireless communications 
and embedded system design. Historically, these two disciplines have been separated 
intellectually and by Department – with the wireless discipline arising from the field of 
communication theory and embedded systems arising from the field of computer systems. We 
 8
have found that these two fields are merging in this new domain of wireless embedded systems, 
and that a unified perspective on their development is required.  For example, students need to 
understand the tradeoffs between the hardware/software capabilities in the wireless embedded 
devices and the limitations of the communications channel and the communications algorithms. 
Our existing graduate programs, which are deep but narrow, give students no formal tools for 
addressing these tradeoffs.  Our proposed Professional MAS in Wireless Embedded Systems will 
give students valuable training and insight into both areas, and the capstone project will give 
them a unique opportunity to combine these two fields in a creative and original way.   
 
2.3.1    Unit requirements 
 
The MAS Wireless Embedded Systems program proposes a 36-unit degree that is to be taken 
over the course of two years in consecutive quarters. The curriculum consists of nine 4-unit 
courses. The capstone project (4 units) will require a combination of in-class, laboratory (either 
here at UCSD or at the engineers place of work), and off-campus work. 
2.3.2 Required Courses  
 
The Program is envisioned to include four engineering courses (at four units each) that focus on 
the general discipline of Wireless Communications 
 
• Wireless Embedded and Networked Systems (WES267A Professor Curt Schurgers 2nd year) 
• Communication Systems Laboratory I (WES268A Professor George Papen 1st year) 
• Communications Systems Laboratory II (WES268B Professor George Papen 1st year) 
• Communications Circuit Design  (WES265AProfessor James Buckwalter 2nd year)  
 
 
Four engineering courses (at four units each) that focus on the general discipline of Embedded 
Systems 
 
• Embedded Computing (WES145 Professor Ryan Kastner, Fall, 1st year) 
• Advanced Processor Architecture (WES237A Professor Tajana Rosing Spring 1st year) 
• Software for Embedded Computing (WES237B Professor Rajesh Gupta Fall 2nd year) 
• Testing and Validation of Embedded Systems (WES237C Professor Rajesh Gupta Winter 
2nd year) 
 
The descriptions of these classes from the catalog are included in the Appendix. 
 
Each class will culminate in a student final exam. Individual student grades for a course will be 
assigned, based on written understanding assessed through exams and class participation. 
 
Finally WES 207 (Wireless Embedded Systems), a four unit capstone project - this project 
requires that students apply the course material to a realistic wireless embedded system 
engineering problem. This capstone requirement could be taught by several faculty within either 
Department, but Professor Curt Schurgers has offered to be the initial faculty member in charge 
of the capstone requirement.  
 9
 
The MAS in Wireless Embedded Systems will enroll approximately 20-30 new students per year 
(approximately 40-60 enrolled students at any given time) at steady-state.  Courses will be 
offered on nights and weekends. The students are expected to take 1-2 courses per quarter, 
requiring two years to complete the degree.   
 
This schedule will not impact current graduate programs, as there is currently a capacity within 
the faculty involved to teach the program on load; however should this situation change or if 
there is a need, we may consider offering the courses off load.   
 
The program is required to be self-supporting, so no financial resources whatsoever can be diverted 
from the Departments to support the MAS program. A small amount of faculty time will also be 
diverted to the MAS program. However, we anticipate it will have no impact on the existing MS and 
PhD programs for several reasons. First, in many cases, the teaching of the MAS courses will be 
“off-load” and so the program will have no impact on the current faculty teaching load (both 
graduate and undergraduate). In those cases, where the faculty will be teaching “on-load,” the 
program fees will reimburse the Departments for the lost curse, and the Departments will use the 
funds to pay for an outside lecturer. So,  in this scenario, there will be no loss of instruction.  
 
We have structured the program in such a way that distance learning is not an integral  feature of 
the educational experience at this time, but we will use educational technology where appropriate 
to enhance the experience for our professional students.   For example, depending on the interest 
and availability of the videoconference rooms at UCSD and at a few distant locations, we would 
like to offer the program synchronously. But we would only do this if the distance learning 
adheres to all the requirements put in place by the Academic Senate  
 
http://senate.ucsd.edu/committees/CEP/PolicyChanges/DistanceAndOnlineInstruction.htm 
 
In these cases, when exams are administered, students may be required to attend on campus or 
distant proctoring will be arranged.  Should the Academic Senate approve other methods for 
offering courses at a distance, perhaps asynchronously, we would consider these in the future.  
 
We also plan to videotape the lectures in selected classes and make them available for streaming to 
enrolled students, but the recording of courses is strictly for review of material, as working 
professionals may have business related travel demands that occasionally make them unable to attend 
lectures.  
 
2.4 Capstone Project, Evaluation, and Examinations 
 
The Professional MAS WES program will require a 4-unit capstone course. The project topic 
will be selected during the quarter prior to the final program in the quarter and will be 
determined with the assistance of the lead faculty member for the course.  If students are unable 
to select a topic of relevant interest, possible topics for consideration will be provided for them. 
The intent is that the capstone project will be a 2-3 person team design project conducted with 
people who work in the same company. If this is not possible the capstone project may be an 
individual effort supervised by the lead faculty member.  
 10
 
The main objective of this project will be for small teams to demonstrate their critical thinking, 
organization, and design skills in attacking a problem within the WES field.  The groups may 
approach this project as consultants hired to develop a new type of embedded wireless device for 
a specific application. They might be responsible for designing the device and implementing a 
working prototype.  At the end of the quarter, a final “consultancy” report must be handed in, 
and a short technical oral presentation must accompany the deliverable.  In addition, there might 
be a demonstration of the working prototype. The presentation and report will be reviewed by 
both the instructor and the other class participants in a peer-to-peer review process. 
 
Performance on the capstone project will be used as an important measure of the student’s 
learning in the MAS Program. Each student will be evaluated based on his/her grasp of the 
course material and his/her ability to apply the course material to the capstone project. 
Satisfactory completion of the capstone team project is required for award of the MAS degree.    
Evaluation of the completed capstone project will serve as the final examination for the capstone 
project. 
2.5 Qualifying Examinations 
No Qualifying Examination is required. 
2.6 Thesis and/or dissertation   
No Thesis or dissertation is required. 
2.7 Final examination 
No final examination is required. 
2.8 Special requirements over and above Graduate Division minimum requirements. 
There are no special requirements over and above Graduate Division requirements. 
2.9 Relationship of master’s and doctor’s programs. 
This program will result in a supplemental Masters degree with no relationship to a doctoral 
program. 
2.10 Special preparation for careers in teaching. 
Teaching is not a component of this degree. 
2.11 Sample program 
 
There are nine courses required for completion of this program.  Courses could be scheduled 
according to the following sample plan: 
 
 
 Fall Winter Spring 
Year 1 WES 145 WES268A WES268B 
WES237A 
Year 2 WES237B WES237C WES207 Capstone 
 11
WES265A WES267A Project 
 
Note that the program starts with the “fundamentals” of embedded systems and wireless 
communications at the upper division undergraduate and graduate  level in the first two quarters. 
Also note that each student is only expected to take one course per quarter initially, to ease them 
back into academic life.  Then it moves into graduate courses and a higher level of engagement 
for the next year. The course are interrelated so that the student gains increasing expertise in the 
two key domain areas, with the capstone project synthesizing the learning at the end of the 
process.  
2.12 Normative time from matriculation to degree.  
 
The normative time from matriculation to degree is two years. This takes into account the target 
student population of experienced working professionals, as well as the course sequence as 
outlined in the previous section. 
 
3 PROJECTED NEED 
3.1 Student demand for the program 
We expect that there will be a robust demand for this program, due to the large availability of 
wireless companies in the San Diego area, including Qualcomm, ViaSat, Motorola, Nokia, 
Huawei, Texas Instruments, etc. Of course, this is also a fertile area for entrepreneurial activity, 
and the “Qualcomms of the future” will also be supporters of this program. Table I on the next 
page, illustrates the estimated growth of employment in the high-tech area in the San Diego area 
in the next decade.1  
 
Table I shows that the high-tech area is expected to grow in the San Diego area in the coming 
years, with large growth coming in the computer software and hardware fields, which are the 
focus of this program. The increase will be close to 5000 jobs, and a large portion of this will be 
in the wireless communications filed, which is the historic strength of the San Diego area.  
 
While high-tech employment is slated to grow in the San Diego region in the coming years, the 
potential need for a Professional Masters degree in this area is evident by the letters of support 
from industry (included in the Appendix). 
 
Overall, the number of master’s degrees awarded in the U.S. has increased by 43% from 1996 to 
2006. While science and engineering fields have seen a slower-than-average growth, it is also 
substantial at 26%. Engineering is one of those fields where the master’s degree is generally 
recognized as an entry point to the profession. 
 
Another indication of professional engineers’ needs for a mater’s degree, especially from 
distance-learning, is reflected by the fact that the Viterbi School of Engineering at USC enrolls

more than 4,000 MS students through its Distance Education Network program.2  Many of these 
students are employees of the companies in the San Diego County. 
 
According to salary surveys, the master’s graduate commands a relatively high salary during the 
early years of a career3. Data from the National Science Foundation (NSF) reveal that median 
salaries of master’s degree recipients one to five years after the degree was conferred tend to be 
higher than those with a Bachelor’s degree. More importantly, salaries of master’s degree 
holders in science and engineering have grown faster over the past 10 years than salaries of 
baccalaureate or doctorate holders.3

In addition, master’s graduates who do not pursue a doctorate have four extra years or so to earn 
their relatively high salaries. Overall, then, a typical student should obtain a substantial financial

return for their tuition investment. The “market premium” for a master’s degree also signals 
good employment opportunities for graduates, and a compelling value proposition for employers. 
This market premium is illustrated in Fig. 1 on the next page, which shows the lifetime earnings 
trends of people with BS, MS and PhD’s in the S&E fields. There is a $200k to $300k lifetime 
premium for an MS degree compared to a BS.

The proposed program is designed for experienced working professionals who want to augment 
their education in engineering. Industry need and student demand for this program is very strong. 
3.2 Opportunities for placement of graduates 
The program is intended for working engineers who will be supported by their companies and 
employed during the program. As a result, the placement of graduates is not a primary concern to 
this program except that it may improve prospects for advancement and future employment 
opportunities. For students who are unemployed, the Jacobs School Engineering Student 
Services and the campus Career Service Center can provide some assistance in terms of résumé 
advising, internship opportunities, and jobs listing.

3.3 Importance to the discipline 
The burgeoning discipline of Wireless Embedded Systems (WES) is focused on methodologies 
and tools to develop next-generation wireless embedded systems. The proposed MAS in WES is 
concerned with educating students at the intersection of multi-disciplinary engineering skills. 
Because the field of WES is still maturing, this program will provide students with the 
opportunity for a state-of-the art interdisciplinary engineering education as well as a rich area for 
significant and heretofore largely unexplored challenges.  
 
The discipline of embedded wireless systems also requires a fundamental re-engineering of the 
educational approach. The classic issue of “deep but narrow” vs. “shallow but broad” requires re-
evaluation. In this field, engineers need to be both deep and broad. The purpose of this program 
is to enable this training in an area that draws on several different engineering disciplines, and 
where expertise is required in all the areas to make really effective progress.  
3.4 Ways in which the program will meet the needs of society 
California and the United States need more highly qualified engineers. This simple statement is a 
reflection of a deeper truth: to maintain our standard of living as a nation, we need to continue to 
innovate and lead in Science and Engineering. A recent speech by Senator Ted Kaufman 
marking the recent 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission to the moon captured the essence of 
the need for highly trained, innovative, engineers4. A few quotes from that speech are: 
 
“The vitality of our economy rests with our ability to be the world's leader in innovation. As we 
face some of our greatest economic challenges, the scientific and engineering community has the 
greatest potential to find avenues for what we need most: new, sustainable jobs.” 
 
“I am confident that engineers will continue to foster the research and innovation that will lead 
America on a path to economic recovery and prosperity. They will help us build a clean energy 
economy, stay competitive in a globalizing world, and drive the real-world applications from our 
nation's health and science research to improve our quality of life. Moreover, these discoveries 
and innovations will create millions of new jobs and invest in our future.” 
3.5 Relationship of the program to research / professional interests of the faculty 
As demonstrated in the faculty biographies in the appendices, the program directly overlaps and 
aligns perfectly with the research interests of every proposed faculty member. For example, 
Professor Rajesh Gupta is a world expert in the field of embedded systems (Founder of the IEEE 
Journal in Embedded Systems). Professor Curt Schurgers is a leading expert in the field of 
underwater networked devices. Professor Tajana Rosing is an expert in the field of low-power 
wireless devices.   
3.6 Program Differentiation 
The proposed program does not duplicate any existing program nation-wide, but rather enhances 
the offerings provided in this field of study and meets a particular need of industry.

4 Faculty 
The program incorporates the expertise of eight ladder rank faculty members who are interested 
in participating in the program.  The course matrix provided in 2.1.1 indicates which faculty will 
serve as courses instructors. The capstone course will be initially managed by Professor Curt 
Schurgers. All faculty associated with the program will have equal opportunity to provide input 
into development and evolution of the program.  All of the faculty members have indicated their 
willingness to serve on the executive committee (discussed in Section 9), if asked to do so. The 
Appendix includes CVs of participating faculty. 
 
5 Courses 
5.1 Core Courses 
The core courses for the program have been designed to provide an integrated program that 
incorporates the most advanced instruction in the fields of embedded systems and wireless 
communications. The order of the courses was chosen to start with advanced undergraduate 
material, to give the students an opportunity to “re-acclimate” to rigorous academic work. Then, 
after the first two quarters, they are exposed to more rigorous graduate level work that builds on 
the material form the beginning of the program.  
 
All but one of the courses (the Capstone course) is currently being offered in the ECE or CSE 
Department.  The course descriptions are as follows: 
 
WES 268A (ECE 157A/ECE268A) Communications Systems Laboratory I - Experiments in the 
modulation and demodulation of baseband and pass-band signals. Statistical characterization of 
signals and impairments. This course is currently under review for “co-listing” as a graduate 
course in ECE.  
 
WES268B (ECE 157B/ECE268B). Communications Systems Laboratory II - Students will plan 
and implement design projects in the laboratory, updating progress weekly and making 
plan/design adjustments based upon feedback. This course is currently under review for “co-
listing” as a graduate course in ECE. 
 
WES265A (ECE 265A). Introduction to noise and linearity concepts. System budgeting for 
optimum dynamic range. Frequency plan tradeoffs. Linearity analysis techniques. Down-
conversion and up-conversion techniques. Modulation and de-modulation. Microwave and RF 
system design communications. Current research topics in the field. 
 
WES267A (ECE267A). Wireless Embedded and Networked Systems: Study of wireless 
networked systems from a system design perspective, covering the protocol stack from physical 
to network layer with a focus on energy. Topics include digital communications, networking and 
programming, and a basic knowledge of these is recommended. 
 
WES145 (CSE 145). Embedded System Design Project: Project class building an embedded 
computing system. Learn fundamental knowledge of microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators. 
Introduction to the hardware and software tools to build project in a team environment and end-
to-end system building. 
 16
 
WES237A (CSE 237A). Introduction to Embedded Computing. Embedded system technologies 
including processors, DSP, memory, and software. System interfacing basics, communication 
strategies, sensors, and actuators. Mobile and wireless technology in embedded systems. Using 
pre-designed hardware and software components. Design case studies in wireless, multimedia, 
and/or networking domains.  
 
WES237B (CSE 237B) Software for Embedded Systems. Embedded computing elements, 
device interfaces, time-critical IO handling. Embedded software design under size, performance, 
and reliability constraints. Software timing and functional validation. Program-ming methods 
and compilation for embeddable software. Embedded runtime systems. Case studies of real-time 
software systems.  
 
WES237C (CSE 237C). Validation and Testing of Embedded Systems. Embedded system 
building blocks including IP cores. Co-simulation. Formal verification using mdel checking. 
Verification environments. Test challenges in core integration: compliance, feature, random, and 
collision testing. Core access and test integration. Interface-based verification and standards.  
 
WES 207 (Wireless Embedded Systems), a four-unit capstone project.  The project topic will be 
selected during the quarter prior to the final program in the quarter and will be determined with 
the assistance of the lead faculty member for the course.  If students are unable to select a topic 
of relevant interest, possible topics for consideration will be provided for them. The intent is that 
the capstone project will be a 2-3 person team design project conducted with people who work in 
the same company. If this is not possible the capstone project may be an individual effort 
supervised by the lead faculty member. 
 
 
We do not feel that the additional strain of these added courses is significant at this point in time for 
several reasons. First, we have recruited new faculty in this area (Ryan Kastner in CSE most 
recently), and two of the principal faculty (Larson and Papen) will be stepping down from 
administrative roles and will have additional time to devote to these courses.  Second, our current 
teaching load (in ECE especially) is modest, as measured by the modified Penner ratio (ECE is 0.94 
for FY 2009 and CSE is 1.0 for FY 2009).  So, both Departments are prepared and able to devote 
resources to this effort.  
 
The program is required to be self-supporting, so no financial resources whatsoever can be diverted 
from the Departments to support the MAS program. A small amount of faculty time will also be 
diverted to the MAS program. However, we anticipate it will have no impact on the existing MS and 
PhD programs for several reasons. First, in many cases, the teaching of the MAS courses will be 
“off-load” and so the program will have no impact on the current faculty teaching load (both 
graduate and undergraduate). In those cases, where the faculty will be teaching “on-load,” the 
program fees will reimburse the Departments for the lost curse, and the Departments will use the 
funds to pay for an outside lecturer. So,  in this scenario, there will be no loss of instruction.  
 
 
However, it is not realistic to say that this additional program can be created without any cost, and 
we need to be completely honest about the tradeoffs. The ECE department expects that this new 
 17
program will cause a modest reduction in course buyouts, roughly two fewer buyouts per year. This 
will negatively effect some aspects of the Department budget, but the effect is small compared to the 
overall total Department budget.  In addition, the faculty and staff will have to respond to increased 
advising responsibilities for these students in both Departments. But this will be offset by the higher 
fees charged for this program, which will allow us to maintain proper staffing of the student affairs 
office.  
 
 
6 Resource requirements 
No new campus resources will be required to support this program as it is completely self 
supporting. Based on the experience of administering other self supporting programs in the 
Jacobs School, enrollment is estimated to be approximately 10 students the first year and 
increase by an increment of 5 students per year.   
 
There are several similar self-supporting Master’s programs currently being offered. Stanford’s 
EE MS degree (15 courses) charges $58,950.5  USC’s online M.S. in Computer Engineeeering (9 
courses) charges $36,720. 6  UCLA’s online MS in Engineering program (36 units) charges 
$30,000 per student.7 The UCSD SOM’s MAS in Leadership of Healthcare Organizations (42 
units) charges $28,500;8 its MAS in Clinical Research (36 units) charges $26,000.9  The MAS in 
International Studies offered by the International Relations and Pacific Studies (48 units) charges 
$30,000 per student.  Students in the proposed UCSD MAS in Wireless Embedded Systems (36 
units) will be charged $27,000. All of the above numbers are just program fees, not including 
health insurance fees ($516 per quarter) and registration fees ($480.50) per quarter).  As shown 
in the accompanying Table, ten students in the program will generate an annual income of 
approximately $270,000 and will be sufficient to support the program and generate a small 
surplus that will allow some reinvestment.  The program financial forecast is summarized below 
in Table II. The following paragraph presents a summary of the financial analysis.  
 
Section 2.3.2 mentions that because of the enough capacity in the ECE and CSE departments the 
faculty involved to teach the program will be on load; but, if necessary, we may consider 
offering the courses off load  Here we assume the 4 instructors of core and project courses are 
paid off load at 1.5 months of their salary but capped at $15,000 per course.   This cap, slightly 
higher than 1.5 months of a Full Professor, Step II ($14,250), is substantially higher than the cap 
of $10,000 the summer session pays its instructor. In addition, ½ TA (10 hours/week) is assigned 
for 10-15 students and 1 TA (20 hours/week) is assigned for 16-29 students in the class.  This is 
substantially more generous than the current TA allocation in the department (1/2 TA for 50 
students in ECE) and is required in order to provide these MAS students the additional high-
quality support that they will need to re-enter the academic environment after their hiatus. The  ½ 
TA costs about $3,000 in stipend and $4,000 in fees, and 1 TA costs $6,000 in stipend and 
$4,000 in fees.  The IT cost (video server and some IT support) is estimated to be $45,000 for

videotaping the lectures for those students who might miss a class due to work-related travel.  
The TA will do the videotaping.   
 
Each course requires one TA per quarter. There are nine courses offered per year, so there are nine 
TA-quarter’s required per year. Each of the TAs is used only for the one quarter class. These TAs 
will not be diverted  from TA assignments in the existing undergraduate or graduate courses. Full  
TA coverage for these MAS courses is especially  important for students returning to an 
academically challenging environment after several years away from the University. The full-scope 
of the TA duties involves grading homeworks and quizzes, supervising Laboratory Sessions, 
responding to student questions during office hours and by e-mail where necessary, installing and 
running software design packages, assisting the faculty during exams, and possibly videotaping the 
courses when needed 
 
 
The Dean’s Office in the Jacobs School charges 8.15% for administrating the program (room 
reservation, receiving payments, and paying faculty, etc.).  Finally about 15% of the fees 
generated will be reserved for financial aids for those whose tuition fees are not covered by their 
employers.  The financial aid will be in the form of 4 $10,000 scholarships.

7 Graduate Student Support 
 
MAS students are ineligible for merit-based aid due to the fact that students enrolled in the 
program are already working professionals. 
 
8 Changes in Senate regulations 
 
No changes to Senate regulations are proposed. 
 
9 Program Governance and Administration 
 
The program is interdisciplinary in nature and involves two departments within the Jacobs 
School of Engineering. The program will be jointly administered by the  Department of Electrical 
and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, much like the 
undergraduate Computer Engineering program. In this case, it will be administered by the MAS 
Steering Committee, which is made up of faculty from both departments. This will be an  ECE–CSE 
joint degree program offered in both departments. The student can receive an MAS in either ECE or 
 19
an MAS in CSE (at the student’s discretion), although admissions to the MAS will be decided by the 
MAS steering committee. In this sense, the joint program will be very similar to the already existing 
UCSD Computer Engineering undergraduate program, which is jointly offered between the 
Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering.  
 
The MAS program itself will be administered by an MAS WES Executive Steering Committee, 
consisting of two members of each Department (ECE and CSE). One additional member of the 
steering committee will be designated as the Program Director by the Dean of the Jacobs School 
of Engineering, and the Director will appoint the other members, in consultation with the 
Department Chairs of the Jacobs School. The steering committee is charged to 
 
• Oversee student recruitment and admissions decisions.  
• Recommend academic standards as well as other requirements, for continued student 
enrollment in the program.  
• Provide curriculum oversight for the program. 
• Advise the departments and the Dean of Graduate Studies concerning students who fail to 
fulfill requirements of the program.  
• Oversee management of funds.  
• Guide the continuous evaluation of the program.  
• Oversee/organize events and program-wide activities, discussions, retreats, etc.  
 
Students will be mentored by faculty involved in the program.  Admission into the MAS 
program will be limited to the number of students who can be appropriately supervised by the 
available and interested faculty. Ultimate authority rests with the Steering Committee to 
determine student requirements, admissions, and management of the program.  While intended to 
provide program guidance, the Steering Committee’s role is advisory to both the Program the 
Director and the ECE and CSE Departments, ultimately resting with the faculty who are 
members of the Academic Senate. 
 
Academic Advising will be handled through the Departments (with ECE providing support for 
ECE courses, CSE providing support for CSE courses, and ECE providing support for general 
programmatic advising in terms of courses, degree planners, etc). At the same time, we want to 
ensure that the MAS students are integrated with the rest of the engineering student body within 
the Jacobs School of Engineering and benefit from close relationships with the entire Jacobs 
School graduate student infrastructure. This aspect of the relationship will be managed by the 
Engineering Student Services (ESS) operation, which is administered by the Divisional Dean. 
The ECE , CSE and ESS  staff may be accessible to students outside of standard business hours 
to ensure that MAS students are integrated with the rest of the engineering student body and 
benefit from close relationships with the entire Jacobs School graduate student infrastructure. 
Fees from MAS students will finance the extra advising required by the Departments and ESS so 
that it does not impact the support provided to traditional graduate students at the Jacobs School.   
 
One administrator will be designated to serve as a liaison between the university and the MAS 
students to ensure the unique needs of working adult students are met and to provide guidance to 
students regarding university procedures.  These student service functions include:  
 
 20
• Organizing prospective students’ application packets, supporting the Admissions 
Committee, and helping to determine appropriate fees  
• Assisting students with expediting enrollment, enforcing deadlines, and ascertaining 
that students receive ancillary services such as parking stickers, ID cards, and 
computer registration  
• Checking fee waivers and exemption contracts, providing loan packets, explaining 
financial obligations to the students 
• Conveying student comments concerning administration to course planners and 
making sure that students’ needs are met 
• Ascertaining that students complete courses needed for the degree, assisting them 
with career transitions or placement interests  
• Assistance with visa, housing, insurance and other arrangements for students from 
outside the San Diego region 
 
Financial management involves setting program fees, planning a budget, monitoring actual vs. 
projected income, monitoring expenditures, reporting to campus and OP budget and audit 
offices, and negotiating fee discounts. 
 
Faculty services are one additional element of program administration.  Instructor services will 
be handled directly by the Jacobs School with resources funded by MAS fees.  This function 
involves reserving and obtaining access to suitable classrooms, scheduling course meetings, 
ordering textbooks and obtaining audiovisual materials, administering class evaluations and 
grade reports, preparing occasional instructors for their teaching assignments and negotiating 
salaries with them. 
 
All program promotion will be done with the close collaboration of the Jacob School’s Corporate 
Affiliates Program (CAP).

Dear Chair Larson: 
 
I am writing to express my support for the proposal by the Department of Electrical and 
Computer engineering in conjunction with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering 
to establish a new program leading to a Master of Advanced Studies in Wireless Embedded 
Systems. The development of this program could not come at a better time for the wireless and 
embedded systems industry. 
 
There is a growing and urgent need for engineers who can work effectively in a multi-disciplinary 
environment.  At the same time, these engineers need continued training in the advanced skills 
and techniques required for this rapidly changing new field. The proposed program addresses the 
development of the understanding and skills required for engineers working in Wireless Systems 
in my company.  
 
Qualcomm, as the world leader in providing chips and software solutions to the wireless industry, 
strives to maintain its leadership and competitive position. One of the most important components 
of our efforts is the continuous education of our workforce. The program you propose would help 
us greatly to achieve this goal.  
 
I look forward to the participation of our engineering employees in this valuable program as I 
believe it will give us a competitive advantage in this rapidly developing technology sector.    
 
Best regards,

training in the advanced skills and techniques required for this rapidly changing 
new field. The proposed program addresses the development of the understanding 
and skills required for engineers working in Wireless Systems in my company.  
 
Broadcom Corporation is a fabless semiconductor company with forefront 
technologies in Wireless, Cellular and in general Broadband and Networking 
Communications, with more than 7,200 employees worldwide.  Embedded Systems is 
a core technological need for our engineers and I visualize that the proposed 
program will be most attractive for our employees seeking a higher level of 
knowledge/expertise and an advanced professional degree in order to advance 
their career.  
 
 
 
 
I visualize that our engineers at many of our locations but particularly those at the 
San Diego area will be interested to attend this program. Broadcom can be helpful 
in terms of flexible work schedules. 
  
I look forward to the participation of our engineering employees in this valuable 
program as I believe it will give us a competitive advantage in this rapidly 
developing technology sector.

Dear Chair Larson: 
 
I am writing to express my support for the proposal by the Department of Electrical and 
Computer engineering in conjunction with the Department of Computer Science and 
Engineering to establish a new program leading to a Master of Advanced Studies in 
Wireless Embedded Systems. The development of this program could not come at a 
better time for the wireless and embedded systems industry. 
 
There is a growing and urgent need for engineers who can work effectively in a multi-
disciplinary environment.  At the same time, these engineers need continued training in 
the advanced skills and techniques required for this rapidly changing new field. The 
proposed program addresses the development of the understanding and skills required for 
engineers working in Wireless Systems in my company.  
 
 Agilent Technologies, the world’s premier measurement company, offers a full range of 
design, test, and management solutions that span the range of wireless technologies—
from legacy 1G systems through 3G systems such as HSPA to 3GPP Long Term 
Evolution (LTE) and 1xEV-DO. Agilent products cover the lifecycle from early design 
and development, through volume manufacturing, to network deployment and service 
assurance. To stay current with leading state-of-the-art technologies, Agilent’s engineers 
will look forward to taking advantage of the excellence and flexibility of the proposed 
MAS program at UCSD. 
 
I look forward to the participation of our engineering employees in this valuable program 
as I believe it will give us a competitive advantage in this rapidly developing technology 
sector.    
 
Best regards, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bill Wallace 
Director of University Business Development

courses. 
 
7. Purpose (academic or professional training) and distinctive features 
(how does this program differ from other, if any, offered in California?): 
This program will equip graduates with the knowledge they need to address engineering 
challenges posed in the development of embedded wireless systems. This program focuses on 
working engineers and provides a unique education and training program at the interface of 
traditional disciplines.  
 
8. Type(s) of students to be served: 
Prospective students for this program include mid-career professional engineers from 
businesses and government agencies. 
 
9. If program is not in current campus academic plan, give reason for 
proposing program now: 
The proposed program is in response to the needs of industry and government, as evidenced 
by requests from industry and government entities, to provide supplemental short courses to 
employees in this area. 
 
10. If program requires approval of a licensure board, what is the status of 
such approval?  
No licensure board approval is required. 
 
11. Please list special features of the program: 
The MAS degree brings together the expertise of UCSD faculty in Electrical Engineering 
and Computer Science Engineering to address an important need of industry and 
government. The program is geared toward working professionals and prepares them for 
leadership in wireless embedded systems so that new generations of these devices can 
be designed and deployed.  The program employs a capstone project that will 
emphasize team engineering on topics of relevance to the students' employment.

14. List UC campuses and other California Institutions, public or private, 
which now offer or plan to offer this program or closely related programs: 
In surveying existing programs at other universities in California, we find that none 
address the specific focus proposed in this program.   
 
15. List any related program offered by the proposing institution and 
explain relationship:   
None.
 
16. Summarize employment prospects for graduates of the proposed 
program.  Give results of job market survey if such have been made: 
The primary purpose of this degree is not to improve prospects for employment, but to help 
working engineers.  Because the enrollees already possess basic relevant knowledge, the 
MAS degree program supplements this knowledge to help them be more effective in their 
current employment, and to help them have greater influence and leadership within their 
organization. While a market survey has not been conducted faculty teaching in the program 
have been asked by industry and government entities to provide supplemental short courses 
to their employees in this area.  It is the opinion of these faculty that employees trained 
in this area will be rare and in high demand. Furthermore, the letters of support and the 
local industry employment data supplied in the proposal demonstrate the need for this 
program.  
 
17. Give estimated enrollment for the first 5 years and state basis for 
estimate: 
Enrollment for the first year of the program is estimated to be 10 professional 
engineers. As the program gains acceptance in the general community, enrollment is expected
to grow to 20-30 students/year.  This is based on the experience of the Jacobs School's 
other self-supporting programs and contacts through the Corporate Affiliates Program 
as well as contacts of the ECE and CSE faculty conducting research in this area.

18. Give estimates of the additional cost of the program by year for 5 years 
in each of the following categories:  FTE Faculty, Library Acquisitions, 
Computing, Other Facilities, Equipment. Provide brief explanation of any of 
the costs where necessary. 
The program is completely self-supporting; no additional campus resources are anticipated. 
  
 
19. How and by what agencies will the program be evaluated? 
The MAS degree program will be evaluated every 8 years by the Academic Senate at 
UCSD.  In addition, end-of-course surveys will be conducted of students participating in the 
program in terms of the quality of teaching and program delivered.  Alumni surveys are also 
anticipated.
