A prominent economist once asked, “com‐puter chips, potato chips, what’s the differ‐ence?” The short answer is “a lot.” As this factsheet demonstrates, computer chips—ormore broadly defined, information and com‐munications technology, including hardware,software, telecommunications, and theInternet—has been, is and will likely remain,for the foreseeable future, the dominantdriver of growth and innovation in the UnitedStates and throughout the global economy.Even more than 28 years after the first dot‐com website was registered, information andcommunications technology (IT) continues tobe a driver of prosperity. This fact sheet pres‐ents statistics showing the benefits that IT is providing, from jobs and output to compet‐itiveness and innovation.

> In 2010, IT industries employed 5.8 percent of workers in
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries,
a 13 percent increase over the 5.1 percent they employed in 1995.6
> In OECD countries, employment in IT services grew by 18 percent
between 1996 and 2008, while employment in business services
overall grew by 12 percent.7
> For every 1 percent increase in broadband penetration in a U.S.state, employment increases by 0.2 to 0.4 percent.8
> The Internet creates 2.6 jobs for every job it eliminates.9
Comprises a Significant Share of GDP
> In 2011, the IT industry contributed about $650 billion to the U.S.
economy, or 4.3 percent of GDP, increasing from 3.4 percent of GDP
in the early 1990s.10 Include the benefits to other sectors derived
from IT use and this rises to approximately $1 trillion, or 7.1 percent
of GDP.11
> Global output from IT industries more than doubled from $1.2 tril-
lion in 1995 to $2.8 trillion in 2010, accounting for 6 percent of
global GDP.12
> The Internet “industry” accounts for, 3.4 percent of GDP across the
large economies that comprise 70 percent of global GDP.13

Creates High-Paying Jobs
> Between 2001 and 2011, over 565,000 IT-related jobs (in all indus-
tries) were created in the United States, an increase of 22.2 percent.
IT jobs grew more than 95 times faster than employment as a whole,
which grew by only 0.2 percent.1
> In 2011, IT workers earned $78,584 a year, 74 percent more than the
average worker ($45,230). Accounting for just the growth in these
high-paying IT jobs, U.S. GDP was over $89 billion larger in 2011
than it was in 2001.2
> Even during the Great Recession and its aftermath, when overall jobs
were declining, IT jobs grew. Between May 2007 and May 2011, 
IT jobs grew by 6.8 percent, contributing $37 billion to an economy
that was otherwise stagnant.3
> Increased investments in IT actually lead to more, not less job cre-
ation. U.S. corporations that invested more in IT expanded their
workforces by 14 percent between 2006 and 2010, while the average
increase of Fortune 500 firms that invested less in IT increased 
employment  just 6 percent.4
> From 2000 to 2009, service-sector companies that used IT inten-
sively grew jobs at a rate of 5.1 percent, while non-IT intensive
service companies expanded jobs by only 1.5 percent.5

> IT workers contribute three to five times more to productivity than
non-IT workers.22
> IT purchases generate approximately three times their cost in value
for consumers.23
> A 10 percent increase in broadband penetration adds between 
0.25 and 1.38 percentage points to a country’s GDP growth.24
> A 10 percent substitution from 2G to 3G mobile broadband penetra-
tion increases GDP per capita growth by 0.15 percentage points per
year, and a doubling of mobile data use increase GDP per capita
growth by 0.5 percentage points.25
> Broadband adoption increases the productivity of manufacturing
firms by approximately 5 percent, of services firms by approximately
10 percent, and of firms in the information industry by approxi-
mately 20 percent.26
> In EU countries labor productivity is higher in industries where more
employees are linked by broadband.27
> A 10 percent increase in mobile device penetration increases produc-
tivity by 4.2 percentage points.28

> IT was responsible for 75 percent of U.S. productivity growth from
1995 to 2002, and 44 percent from 2000 to 2006.14
> IT has accounted for 20 percent of U.S. GDP growth since 1995, 
despite constituting just 4 percent of U.S. GDP.15
> Over the last two decades, IT has made the U.S. economy over 
$2 trillion larger in terms of annual GDP.16
> A 10 percent increase in a country’s IT capital stock adds approxi-
mately 0.45 percentage points to its annual GDP growth.17
> The Internet alone accounted for 21 percent of the GDP growth from
2006 to 2011 across 13 leading economies—Brazil, Canada, China,
France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Sweden, the UK,
and the United States.18
> Because of the impact of dot-com Internet domains, annual global
GDP is $1.5 trillion larger.19
> The value added by IT services in OECD countries grew by 115 per-
cent between 1996 and 2008.20
> Between 2006 and 2010, corporations that invested more in 
IT increased productivity three times as fast as corporations that 
invested less.21
> In 2012, over 88 percent of the 500 most popular mobile apps were
developed by small businesses, most with fewer than 10 employees.34
> While 21 million dot-com domain names were registered between
1985 and 2000. 57 million were registered between 2000 and 2010,
bringing the number of global dot-com domain names to close to 
80 million.35

sales, 25 percent of merchant wholesalers’ sales, and 16 percent of

Helps Build High-Growth Companies 
> In the 2011 Inc. 5000 rankings of the 5,000 fastest growing compa-
nies in the United States, almost one-quarter (1,140) were in the 
IT industry, with a three-year average growth rate of 302 percent and
revenues totaling nearly $54 billion.29
> In Deloitte’s 2011 Technology Fast 500 Ranking, a ranking of the
fastest growing high-technology firms in the United States, 330 of
the 500 companies were in the IT industry.30
> In Canada, France, Germany, the U.K. and the United States, small
firms that adopt Internet business solutions earn approximately nine
percent more revenue than other small firms.31
Creates New Sectors and Ways of Doing Business
> Between 2002 and 2011, U.S. retail sales through e-commerce in-
creased by 19.8 percent annually in comparison to just 3.2 percent
for total retail sales, reaching $193 billion in 2011.32
> In 2012 there were 466,000 U.S. jobs related to mobile apps, up from
zero in 2007. The mobile app economy generated almost $20 billion
in revenue in 2011.33

Occupations included in the IT jobs classification in 2011 are “Computer Systems Analysts,” “Computer Programmers,”
“Software Developers, Applications,” “Software Developers, Systems Software,” “Database Administrators,” “Network and
Computer Systems Administrators,” “Computer Support Specialists,” “Computer and Information Research Scientists,”
“Information Security Analysts, Web Developers, and Computer Network Architects,” and “Computer Occupations, All
Other.” Because the Bureau of Labor Statistics regularly reclassifies occupations as the economy evolves, there are differences
in the IT jobs classification for 2001. Specifically, 2011’s “Information Security Analysts, Web Developers, and Computer
Network Architects” occupations did not exist in 2001 and “Computer Occupations, All Other” was not counted in 2001.
Additionally, 2001 included a “Network Systems and Data Communication Analysts” occupation that had been superseded 
by 2011.

IT jobs’ contribution to GDP was calculated by subtracting the product of IT employment in 2001 and IT earnings in 2001
from the product of IT employment in 2011 and IT earnings in 2001. This assumes that these workers currently employed in
IT would otherwise be unemployed.
