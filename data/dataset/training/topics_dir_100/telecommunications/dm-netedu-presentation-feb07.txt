CSTB2001 Report
“Looking Over the Fence at Networks: A 
Neighbor's View of Networking Research”
– By Computer Science & Telecommunications 
Board (CSTB), National Research Council of 
US
• Published in 2001 by National Academy Press, 
available 
http://books.nap.edu/html/looking_over_the_fence/report.pdf
• Addresses Three Broad Areas
DM, February 2007, p.4NeTReL, Networking & Telecommunications Research 
Lab
CSTB 2001 report: First Area
Measuring: Understanding the Internet 
Artifact
– Challenge of Scale
• How to infer based on incomplete knowledge of 
configuration
• How to soundly sample network traffic, and validity of 
sampling approach
– Measurement Infrastructure
• Deployment and operational challenges
– Nontechnical factors
• Compose of production commercial systems
– E.g., Confidentiality and privacy of data

CSTB 2001 Report: Second Area
Modeling: New Theory for Networking
– Performance:
• E.g., What sort of change in the scale and traffic pattern 
lead to a performance meltdown?
• Theoretical foundations in flow-level modeling, 
aggregration/deaggregation, micro/macro level 
interaction
– Beyond Performance:
• Concern for manageability, reliability, robustness, and 
evolvability—new basic understanding and theory
– Applying Theoretical Techniques to Networking
• Understand convergence properties
• New routing algorithms taking real-world constraints 
(e.g. absence of complete information)

CSTB 2001 Report: Third Area
Making disruptive prototypes (“Innovator’s 
Dilemma”) 
“A Disruptive technology can do a few things 
very well but may not do some very well 
compared to present technology”
• Example, RISC architecture (from computer architecture 
world)
Developing “disruptive” prototypes that 
challenge the current Internet
• E.g. Where should the intelligence in the network reside?

Trouble with Success (CSTB 2001 
Report)
os·si·fi·ca·tion := The process of becoming set in a 
rigidly conventional pattern, as of behavior, habits, 
or beliefs (American Heritage Dictionary)
Intellectual ossification
– E.g., it’s not TCP!
Infrastructure ossification
– What researchers want may not be deployed in a 
commercial network (e.g., limited multicast deployment, 
QoS)
System ossification
– Research results judged based on how hard it is to deploy on 
the Internet

Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
Network functionality allowed the possibility 
for DoS attack
– First “wave”: Web-server oriented
– Next “wave”: network impact (e.g. code-red virus)
Follow-up Research

Needs/Issues in Networking 
Research
Recap:
– Current networks-related research
– Future networks/services-related research
– External factor that drives research (often 
for current networks; however, principles 
might be useful for “future” networks)
Issues:

Broadband Access Technology and 
Service Dynamics
Broadband access Technology (DSL, 
Cable Modem) designed for “web”
model
– Lot of download bandwidth
– Not much upstream bandwidth
Challenge faced (last few years)
– P2P services: Napster, …
– VoIP services

Broadband Access Technology and 
Service Dynamics (cont’d)
Can we design an access mechanism that is 
dynamically adjustable between upstream and 
downstream
– Time-Division Duplexing (TDD)? Others?
– Require solid  knowledge of physical, data link, and 
transport layer?
Questions:
– How well will the dynamics work?
– How does it impact service behavior? Where is the trade-
off?
– Are there possible pitfalls due to dynamism? And How to 
handle them?
• (recall: lesson learned from Telephone dynamic routing, TCP 
congestion, …)

Core Network Interactions: Multi-
Layer Networking Dynamics
If IP layer link setting is dynamically 
adjustable to address for failure
If optical networking handles its own 
dynamic routing (GMPLS)
– Good for each network, may not be good 
together?
• Can the inter-related network go into tailspin? 
– How does ‘DoS’ attack based ‘increase’ in network 
traffic impact dynamic adjustability?
– How do we know good from bad traffic (e.g., a 
new P2P product popularity, or a new DoS
attack)?

Routing table growth
Data source: http://bgp.potaroo.net/
Our recent estimate:
N = 105625 + 920.608  (4 Y - 8007)1.52894,   for Y >=2002

Routing table growth: problems
Internet Architecture Board: Routing and 
addressing workshop (reported at IETF67, 
San Diego, CA, Nov’06)
– TCAM/SRAM for routers slow growth
– ASIC is already pushing limits
– Memory speed improves about 10% per year
– State growth is “super-linear”
– Current trends in the growth are not scalable
– Use of IP addresses for both ID and Location is a 
problem
– Sort of “second CIDR wave”, but more difficult

Future Directions:
Developing “disruptive” prototypes 
that challenge the current Internet
How to do it?
Not possible to test over the current 
Internet
– It’s a production network!
Retro-fitting is difficult (remains 
“patch-work” problem)

Steps to Making it happen ..
NSF’s new research program: 
– FIND (Future Internet Design)
– Inviting proposals on radical architectural directions
GENI (Global Environment for Networking 
Innovations) http://www.geni.net
– A large-scale proposed test-bed for experimentation
• Experimentation in every layer of the network
• Customized hardware development
• Test before deploy time environment
• Allow many researchers to participate
• Alliance with European Community

How to ensure that “all” problems 
are addressed
Classify problems: Wired/wireless, 
Core/Access
Core Networks
• Some idea because of IETF, NANOG (e.g. BGP problem, 
addressing growth …)
Access Networks
• Cable/Modem, wireless
• Campus/Enterprise Networks
– Need input from Net@Edu community
Security/Resilience as inherent design 
paradigm

Finally, at a Fundamental Level
Is there a ‘new’ network communication 
mode out there?
Consider time spacing:
+ Between Telegraphy and Telephony: ~50 
years
+ Between Telephony and Internet: ~100 years
+ Between Internet and ??
- Will everything now onward be “incremental”?
- How to not get trapped in ossification?
