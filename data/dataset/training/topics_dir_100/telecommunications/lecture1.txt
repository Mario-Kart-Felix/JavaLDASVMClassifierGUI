Introductory Concepts
 Telecommunication means “communications at a distance”
 Tele in Greek means at a distance
 Electrical communications by 
 wire, radio, or light (fiber optics)
 Traditionally two distinct disciplines:
 Switching: selects and directs communication signals to a 
specific user or a group of users
 Transmission: delivers the signals in some way from source to 
the far-end user with an acceptable signal quality 
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Simple Transmission System
 The source may be a simple telephone microphone, 
keyboard
 The destination may be a simple telephone speaker, 
monitor

Transmission Medium
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Transmission Media
 It can be a seen as a single electrical medium
 Or, as a cascade of electrical media
 Networks show a gain or loss. 
 To understand these gains or loss, a good knowledge of the 
decibel and related measurement units is needed.

dB in Communications
 The db (decibel) is a relative unit of measurement 
commonly used in communications for providing a 
reference for input and output levels. 
 Power gain or loss.
 Decibels are used to specify measured and calculated 
values in 
 audio systems, microwave system gain calculations, satellite 
system link-budget analysis, antenna power gain, light-budget 
calculations and in many other communication system 
measurements 
 In each case the dB value is calculated with respect to a 
standard or specified reference. 
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Calculation of dB
 The dB value is calculated by taking the log of the ratio of 
the measured or calculated power (P2) with respect to a 
reference power (P1). 
 The result is multiplied by 10 to obtain the value in dB. 
 It can be modified to provide a dB value based on the ratio 
of two voltages. By using the power relationship P = V2/R 
P1 P2
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Definitions of dBm and dBW
 dBm indicates that the specified dB level is relative to a 1 
milliwatt reference. 
 If Power is expressed in watts instead of milliwatts. 
 the dB unit is obtained with respect to 1 watt and the dB values are 
expressed as dBW.

Examples
 Important Note: The decibel (dB) is “the logarithm of a 
power ratio” and NOT a unit of power;
 However, dBW and dBm are units of power in the 
logarithmic system of numbers
 Convert the following into dBm or dBW
 P=1mW,      P(dBm)=?
 P=0.1mW, P(dBm)=?
 P=10W, P(dBW)=?
 P=1W, P(dBm)=?
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
dB Hint
 dB value=10log104/2=10log102=10×0.3010=+3.01dB≈3dB
 Memorize the above relationship
 The amplifying network has a 3-dB gain because the output 
power was the double the input power

Telephony
 The telephone is connected to Public switched 
telecommunications network (PSTN) for local, national , 
and international voice communications
 The same connections can carry data and image 
information (television)
 The connection to the PSTN may be via local exchange 
carriers (LEC) 
 End-users, nodes, and connectivities
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Voice Telephony
 Transmission of the human voice
 Voice is a sound signal
 Analog voice-band channel
 A channel that is suitable for 
transmission of speech or analog 
data and has the maximum usable frequency range of 300 to 
3400 Hz.
 The local serving switch is the point of the connectivity with 
the PSTN
 It is the point where the analog signal is digitized.

Telephone Subset
 It is a device which converts human  speech in the form of 
sound waves produced by the vocal cord to  electrical 
signals. These signals are then transmitted over telephone  
wires and then converted back to sound waves for human 
ears.

Telephone Handset
 Microphone (mouthpiece)
 consists of a movable speaker diaphragm that is sensitive to both 
amplitude and frequency
 The diaphragm contains carbon particles that can conduct 
electricity.
 As the human voice spoken into the transmitter varies, the 
amount of carbon granules that strike the electrical contacts in
the mouthpiece also varies—thereby sending varying analog 
electrical signals out into the voice network.
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Telephone Handset
 Earphone (earpiece) 
 Acts in an opposite direction to the mouthpiece.
 The electrical signal/waves produced by the transmitter are 
received at an electromagnet in the receiver.
 Varying levels of electricity produce varying levels of 
magnetism—that, in turn, cause the diaphragm to move in 
direct proportion to the magnetic variance.
 The moving diaphragm produces varying sound that 
corresponds to the sound waves that were input at the 
transmitter.

Dialing
 A combination of 350 Hz and 440 Hz sine waves sent to the 
Telephone from the central office (CO) indicating that the 
network is ready to receive calling instructions
 Dialing Modes: Pulse and Touch Tone or Dual-Tone-
MultiFrequency

SS7 Signaling
 Common Signaling System 7, also called SS7 or C7, was developed 
by the in order to increase the efficiency of the public voice 
system. SS7 is a separate network whose duties are setting up, 
tearing down, monitoring, and routing calls on the PSTN.
 SS7 is akin to TCP/IP in that it operates at several layers of the 
OSI model. And, like TCP/IP, SS7 is packet-based. It is a software-
based system that operates independently of the voice transport 
itself (the PSTN).
 SS7 works behind the scenes, so interacting with SS7 is something 
that the CO switch, not your phone or PBX, must do. SS7 is called 
an out-of-band signaling standard because, unlike DTMF, it 
doesn't use the same frequency band, or even the same 
transport, as the voice transmission. 
 Out-of-band signaling is also called CCS, or common channel 
signaling. It's the technique used by all telecommunication 
vendors—including cellular phone service providers, long-distance 
companies, and local exchange carriers (LECs). All of these 
networks share one thing in common: a common bond in SS7.

Subscriber Loop Design
 Any use of telephone channels involves two unidirectional 
paths, one for transmission and one for reception. 
 The local loop, which connects a telephone to a local 
exchange is a two-wire (2W) circuit that carries the signals 
in both transmission directions. 
 Even asymmetrical digital subscriber lines (ADSLs) use this 
same 2W local
 To connect a 2W local loop to a 4W network a circuit called 
a 2W/ 4W hybrid is needed.

 Two-Wire versus Four-Wire
 All subscriber loops in the telephone network are 
implemented with a signal pair of wires
 Both directions of transmission
 Conversations are superimposed on the wire pair
 Two directions of longer distances are separated
 Two-Wire-to-Four-Wire Conversion
 Basic conversion function is provided by hybrid circuits
 Impedance matching is important
 Impedance mismatch causes “echo”

 Thermal noise - White noise with a Gaussian (Normal) 
distribution of amplitudes
 Noise measurement is important 
 Standard reference value is 1 pW  -90 dBm
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Transmission Impairments - Echo
 If only one reflection occurs, the situation is referred to as 
“talker echo”
 If a second reflection occurs, “listener echo” results
 If returning the signal is repeatedly coupled back into the 
forward path to produce oscillations, singing occurs.
 If the loop gain is greater than unity.
 Echo suppressor – Loss insertion to reduce echo
 Echo canceller –Cancel the echo signal from the return 
path.
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Echo Is Always Present
 Echo as a problem is a function of the echo delay, and the 
magnitude of the echo
(dB)

EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
Power Levels
 Read the dB Tutorial on the course web site
 The delivered signal power must be high enough to be clearly 
perceived
 Not so strong that echo and singing result
 Transmission links are designed with specific amount of net loss
 Via net loss (VNL)
 Transmission Levels Point (TLP) are used as a convenient means 
of expressing signal loss or gain within a circuit. 
 The TLP is a point in the circuit expressed as the ratio (in dB) of the power 
of the signal at that point to the power of the signal at a reference point 
(0 TLP). 
 TLP is the measurement of the signal gain or loss relative to the 0 TLP.
 dBm0 = Signal Power (dBm) - TLP (dB)
 “0” indicates that the specification is relative to the 0-TLP. 
 Ex: If an absolute noise power of 100 pW (20 dBrn or -70 dBm) is measured 
at a -6 TLP, it is expressed as 26 dBrn0. 
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
dB Applied to the Voice Channel
 Noise and amplitude distortion
 Amplitude distortion is the same as frequency response.
 The noise annoys the listener
 How much noise will annoy the average listener?
 The human ear is a filter as is the telephone earpiece
 Amount of annoyance of the noise to the average listener 
varies
 We “shape” the VF channel
as a function of frequency
 Weighting curve
 C-message response (NA)
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
dB Applied to the Voice Channel
 The lowest discernible signal that can be heard by a human 
being is -90 dBm (800 or 1000 Hz)
 If noise power is measured with C-message weighting, 
dBrnC0 is used.
 0 dBrnC=-92 dBm (with white noise loading of entire voice 
channel)
EE4367 Telecom. Switching & Transmission Prof. Murat Torlak
TLP Example
 Example: Using the above figure, determine each of the following: (a) 
the signal power to be applied at point B to determine if points A and C 
are at the proper levels; (b) the amount of gain (loss) a signal
experiences when propagating from A to C; and (c) the amount of noise 
that would be measured at C if 27 dBrnC of absolute  noise is measured 
at B and no additional noise occurs on the B-to-C link.
 Solution: (a) Because point B is -13 dB TLP, the proper test tone level is  
-13 dBm (0.05 mW) (b) Because the TLP values drop by 2 dBm, there is 
2dB net loss from A to C. (c) An absolute measurement of 27 dBrnC at B 
is 40 dBrnC0. This is also 40 dBrnC0 at C. The absolute noise power 
measured at C would be 40-4=36 dBrnC.

Telephone Numbering
 The numbering is hierarchical, and it has an internationally 
standardized country code at the highest level. 
 An international prefix or international access number is used for 
international calls. It tells the network that the connection is to 
be routed via an international telephone exchange to another 
country. 
 The country code contains one to four numbers that define the 
country of subscriber B. Country codes are not needed for 
national calls because their purpose is to make the subscriber 
identification unique in the world. A telephone number that 
includes the country code is called an international number and it 
has a maximum length of 12 digits.
