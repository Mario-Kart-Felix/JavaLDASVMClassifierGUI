2017
Undergraduate 
Bachelor of Engineering 
(Telecommunications Engineering)
(Honours)/Bachelor of Computer 
Science
In this program you’ll combine telecommunications engineering 
with computer science.
Industry connections
In the final year of your studies you’ll undertake 
a major project that is either industry-based or 
simulates an industrial situation. You’ll work with 
industry leaders using the theory and practical 
experience gained through the program to solve a 
problem.
In order to graduate from this program you must 
complete a minimum 12 weeks of engineering 
industry experience that allows you to gain 
first-hand experience in an engineering practice 
environment under the supervision of a practising 
professional engineer. The nature and timing of this 
engineering experience can take a range of forms.
Opportunities exist for an overseas work placement 
of between six and 12 months (this satisfies the 
work experience requirement). These placements 
are normally taken during a one-year break in 
the middle or at the end of the fourth year of the 
program.
As a final year student you can apply for summer 
research scholarships.
International opportunities
RMIT encourages you to aspire to a global career, 
not just a local one.
Through partner organisations in Europe, Asia and 
the United States, the RMIT International Industry 
Experience and Research Program (RIIERP) 
offers workplace training and academic research 
placements of between six and 12 months.
There are also opportunities to study abroad 
through Education Abroad. 
Career outlook
Graduates of this double degree are keenly sought 
after by:
 – industry to design and manufacture 
telecommunications products
 – telecommunications service providers to 
design and maintain telecommunications 
infrastructure, services and networks
 – education research and development 
organisations to advance technologies
 – government organisations with 
telecommunications engineers employed in 
transport, defence, security, meteorology and 
emergency services.
Graduates may also run their own commercial or 
consulting business.
Professional recognition
This program will apply for full accreditation by 
Engineers Australia as soon as possible within 
the accreditation timelines set down by Engineers 
Australia. Upon accreditation being granted, 
graduates of the program will be eligible for 
graduate membership of Engineers Australia. Full 
membership as a professional engineer may be 
obtained after an appropriate period of professional 
practice.  
In telecommunications engineering, you’ll develop 
knowledge and skills to design, build and 
manage systems that transfer, store and manage 
information via radio frequency transmission, 
optical fibres or some other form of wave 
transmission. Telecommunications systems can 
employ a wide range of technologies, including 
optical fibre communication systems, radio 
systems (such as mobile phones and WiFi), cable 
systems and satellite communications.
Within the telecommunications engineering field, 
there are communication (or radio frequency) 
engineers and network engineers. In this program, 
you can specialise in either communication 
engineering or network engineering in the fourth 
and fifth years.
In the computer science component of this 
double degree, you’ll gain extensive knowledge of 
computer systems infrastructure, software methods 
and technologies. You’ll also gain advanced 
knowledge and skills in developing network-based 
real-life computing applications.
This program is taught by experts in their fields. 
Laboratory experiments are used to consolidate 
theories. A strong focus on design and research 
ensures our graduates are highly skilled 
professionals.
Why double-up?
By combining the knowledge of 
telecommunications engineering with skills in 
computer science, you are ideally suited to 
undertake a leading role in system and network 
applications development and management, 
particularly within the area of network engineering. 
Graduates of this double degree program have 
excellent job opportunities and career prospects, 
and the potential to be leaders in their profession.
Full-time: 5 years  
Part-time may be available
