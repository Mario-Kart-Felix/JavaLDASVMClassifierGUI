Research-informed teaching
Research is an integral part of our taught 
postgraduate provision. For example, 
the MSc project, a significant part of our 
MSc programmes, is often undertaken 
within one of our state-of-the-art research 
laboratories with hardware facilities 
including a 100 cubic metre microwave 
anechoic chamber for automated 
measurements up to 20 GHz in Near-Field 
and Far-Field range, as well as various 
simulation and modelling software 
packages. This approach provides the 
opportunity to work alongside established 
researchers on projects that are at the 
cutting edge of technology. 
During Semester time, we run a weekly 
series of Research Seminars, with the 
participation of external speakers as well 
as speakers drawn from groups that make 
up our three research themes, which 
are open to anyone within the School 
to attend. The Seminars provide the 
opportunity for researchers to showcase 
their latest findings through hourly 
presentations and discuss their work in a 
friendly and open environment.
Many of our MSc students are inspired by 
the research environment that we have 
to offer and select to continue with their 
research careers through to Doctorate level.

Environmental and Infrastructure 
Engineering
The Environmental and Infrastructure 
Engineering Group carries out research 
that examines how structures and the 
environment behave under a range of natural 
and human drivers. 
Researchers have access to well-equipped, 
environmental acoustic and hydraulic 
laboratories. These studies have been funded 
by the UK Government’s Research Councils, 
the EU and industry. Staff from this group 
are also part of the Pennine Water Group, a 
large cross-University research group funded 
by the UK Government. The group’s work 
is focused around two main theme areas: 
infrastructure and environment.
 Infrastructure
 In the infrastructure area, researchers 
examine how steel and composite 
structures behave; advanced modelling 
and full-scale laboratory testing is carried 
out in our Large Structures laboratory.
 Other researchers in this area also study 
novel sustainable construction materials 
such as low-energy Roman cements, 
and acoustically absorbent materials 
manufactured from waste materials. 
Other researchers study the interaction 
between soils and structure and develop 
advanced finite element codes to study 
the behaviour of structural materials. The 
work is funded by UK and EU Research 
Councils and industry and has resulted 
in patents and the use of our research 
by industrial end users. Staff and 
students have access to well-equipped 
structures, structural materials and 
acoustic characterisation and material 
manufacturing laboratories.
 Environment
 The staff in the environment theme study 
how infrastructure systems are impacted 
by the environment and how the built 
environment can impact on the natural 
environment. A key issue is how engineers 
can adapt current infrastructure systems 
to long-term climate change. The group’s 
researchers are currently working on 
the development of low-cost, low-energy 
acoustic-based sensors to monitor the 
condition and operational condition of 
drainage infrastructure. This work has 
been funded by the UK Research Councils 
and industrial partners and is now 
moving from the laboratory to practice, 
impacting on end users. Work continues on 
developing other novel sensors that can 
monitor the environment.
 Other researchers are examining how 
urban water systems are impacted by 
climate change, especially with regard 
to the potential for flooding and the 
transport and release of pollutants into 
the natural environment such as rivers. 
These studies range from fundamental 
laboratory studies, to the use of advanced 
modelling techniques such as Smooth 
Particle Hydrodynamics, to studies with 
water companies and other end uses. 
Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering research at the 
University of Bradford has been well 
established for many years. 
Researchers work closely with small, 
medium-sized and large companies and 
business organisations, locally, nationally, 
and internationally, including: Cummins, Ford, 
BAE Systems, Tata, Jaguar Cars, Land Rover, 
Honda, Hyundai, and many others. We have a 
track record of research funded by industry, 
the UK Research Councils – EPSRC and 
other programmes, the European Union and 
international government agencies. 
The broad base of research in Mechanical 
Engineering includes Automotive 
Engineering, Quality and Statistical 
Engineering, Modelling, Simulation, and 
Control Engineering, Computer-Aided 
Process Engineering, Computational 
Mathematics and Numerical Methods, 
Optimisation, Supply Chain Management, 
Predictive Maintenance and Condition 
Monitoring.
Within this broad base we have specific areas 
of research activity such as competitive 
product and process design, failure 
mode avoidance methodologies, car and 
commercial vehicle dynamics and design, 
brakes and braking, including regenerative 
and hybrid systems, vehicle dynamics and 
safety, engine mapping and calibration, and 
power transmission. We aim to encourage 
MSc students to participate in and learn from 
our research work.
We have brought our research excellence 
together in the Research and Knowledge 
Transfer Centre for Automotive Engineering 
which has leading expertise and facilities in 
the following 3 areas:
 Bradford Engineering Quality 
Improvement Centre (BEQIC)

The Student View
ROB  
NORVILL
MSc  
Computing
At Bradford I chose to study 
a part-time postgraduate 
programme in Computing to suit 
my busy home life. The course 
stood out as it allowed me to 
take up a new skillset without 
prior qualifications in computing. 
Before coming to the University 
of Bradford I studied my degree 
in BA (Hons) Philosophy; I 
wanted to change my career 
path and the MSc in Computing 
allowed me to do that. 
I’ve always had an affinity with 
computers and spent most of 
my youth gaming on, building 
and tinkering with them. Doing 
something that intrigues me 
and pushes me to learn all kinds 
of things has always been very 
important for me. My Philosophy 
degree hadn’t served me as well 
as I would have liked in terms of 
employability, so doing something 
that would provide me with 
specific job skills was key for me.
When I started studying my 
Master’s at the School of 
Electrical Engineering and 
Computer Science everyone was 
extremely welcoming and helpful 
right from the off. The lecturers 
are always there to offer support 
and to help me with any queries. 
For me, the encouragement and 
support I get motivates me to 
keep learning and to achieve 
things above and beyond what 
my course requires; that is 
the best thing about being in

Cyber  
Security
MSc
The main goal of this MSc Cyber Security 
programme is to prepare professionally trained 
graduates for relevant positions in industry.  
We therefore work very closely with professionals 
and practitioners to continuously develop the 
programme to ensure it is always current. 
As an example, we are currently the only  
University to offer the opportunity for students  
to gain an additional qualification as a Certified 
ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Implementer. In addition, 
modules in ethical hacking establish skills in 
penetration testing, preparing students for  
further examinations accredited by CREST  
(CREST Practitioner Security Analyst) or  
the EC-Council (CEH v8 Ethical Hacking).
This programme also meets a continued growing 
demand for specialists in this area by offering a 
way for individuals in current employment with 
relevant industry experience, as well as recent 
graduates, to study and enhance and develop their 
skills. The MSc Cyber Security programme will 
therefore draw graduates wishing to enhance their 
undergraduate studies in computing with advanced 
study of security to equip them for senior positions 
with responsibility for the IT technical and 
management-based security of an organisation. 
In addition, the programme admissions criterion 
encourages those with relevant industry skills to 
specialise in cyber security or refine and develop 
their existing expertise. 
This programme draws upon the successful 
research expertise of the School of Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) 
from within the Faculty of Engineering and 
Informatics in the University in addition to that 
within the Interdisciplinary Research Centre (IRC) 
in Cyber Security. This IRC has members from 
within Peace Studies, Engineering, Electrical 
Engineering, Computer Science, Mathematics, 
Telecommunications, Management, Law, Social 
Science and Psychology. This broad base of 
expertise and research is a fantastic resource for 
the continued development of the programme in 
cyber security.

MSc Cyber 
Security
Bradford stood out to me because of its reputation in 
the UK; it was also one of the few Universities to offer 
a postgraduate programme in Cyber Security. 
Technology is at the heart of Bradford; studying at 
the University means you are constantly exposed to 
continuing developments in modern engineering,  
digital media and computing. 
As the field of Cyber Security is a growing concern 
in today’s society, this course has helped me to 
understand perceptions of online safety in the context 
of the wider world.
My degree has introduced me to different types of 
malware, including; viruses and trojans, as well as 
concepts such as network security, cryptography, 
identity theft and risk management.
With the world going mobile, if you have a passion  
or want to understand computer security and how  
it operates, then Cyber Security is certainly an area 
worth studying.

KUMAR PALANI
MSc,  
Personal, Mobile 
and Satellite 
Communications
The Student View
As a Master’s student looking 
to study an MSc, I was 
particularly attracted to the 
University of Bradford as 
the course brought together 
a unique combination of 
Personal, Mobile and Satellite 
Communications. On top of 
this, the University ranking 
for this course and others 
was very impressive. The 
student life in Bradford was 
very appealing, with plenty of 
activities, societies and events 
happening on the campus. 
The range of clubs and sports 
meant that there is never a 
dull moment. 
When I arrived at the 
University of Bradford 
the student Hub was very 
welcoming and helpful. 
My first impression of the 
University was that it had a 
very well-organised campus 
with great facilities. The 
City itself is fairly small with 
beautiful surroundings, from 
museums, theatres and parks. 
I particularly enjoyed seeing 
snow-capped hills and thick 
layers of snow all around on 
my first day at Bradford. 
While at the University I 
attended some great, fun-
filled events and festivals, held 
both in the University and 
the city centre. I spent most 
of my free time volunteering 
as a Student Helper, as well 
as working as a Student 
Ambassador at the University.
During my time at the 
University of Bradford I met a 
lot of friendly people from all 
sorts of diverse cultures and 
backgrounds; I know some of 
them will be lifelong friends. 
Throughout my journey at the 
University of Bradford, I really 
enjoyed the teaching style; 
my lecturers were always 
very engaging and helpful. 
I was able to interact with 
the lecturers very freely to 
discuss any questions based 
on the taught module. Due to 
the challenging nature and 
depth of my Master’s course, 
I was continually learning 
lots of new things and was 
involved in several different 
projects at any one time.
My advice to any future 
student would be to keep 
updated with what’s 
happening in the industry 
and keep an eye on the 
available opportunities. Most 
importantly, prepare and train 
yourself to be well organised 
by setting specific goals 
with your aim, to help you to 
achieve it.

Admissions
How to Apply  
to Bradford
Postgraduate Taught Courses
Courses start in mid-September 
each year (with some courses 
also having a January start), but 
we advise that you submit your 
completed application as soon 
as possible, even if you have not 
yet completed your previous 
course of study. We may make 
an offer conditional upon your 
successful completion of a 
certain qualification. For English 
Language requirements see 
pages 58 to 59.
All applications are considered 
carefully and individually. It helps 
us to process your application 
if the form is clearly written 
or typed, with all sections 
completed fully and accurately, 
and all relevant supporting 
documentation submitted.
To apply online or download a 
copy of the application form, 
visit www.bradford.ac.uk/
postgraduate 
Postgraduate research degrees
If you are contemplating 
undertaking a PhD you will first 
need to contact the Research 
Director in the relevant Faculty 
to discuss your proposed field of 
research in detail. You will need 
to write a detailed Research 
Proposal in collaboration and 
consultation with your potential 
supervisor in Bradford, setting 
out the nature of the problem 
your research will address. This 
should also include a description 
of where your proposed research 
fits into other existing research, 
an indication of expected 
methodology, materials required, 
and how the research programme 
will be funded. The Faculty will 
then assess the quality of the 
proposed research, whether it 
fits in with the Faculty’s existing 
research activities and whether 
the Faculty has a suitable 
supervisor for the proposed 
research, and will then advise you 
if you have been accepted. 
The majority of research students 
start in September, but it may be 
possible to start at other times 
during the year. Typical periods of 
registration for full-time research 
are 15 months (minimum 12) for 
an MPhil, and three years for a 
PhD.
It may be possible for students 
to undertake part or the whole 
programme of research away 
from the University, provided 
that suitable arrangements for 
supervision can be made. This 
must be negotiated with the 
appropriate department.
For more information or to 
apply, visit www.bradford.ac.uk/

English Language 
Requirements
Having a good command of the English language will 
help you truly benefit from your studies in the UK.
English language requirements to study at 
Bradford
If your first language is not English, you will 
have to reach a level of English approved by the 
University before you can be admitted onto any of 
our undergraduate or postgraduate courses. 
You can show you have reached the required level 
in either of two ways.
1. By taking an international English language 
test such as: 
IELTS (International English Language Testing 
System) 
This is administered by the British Council. The 
University normally requires a score of 6.0*, 
with at least 5.5 in each of the four sub-tests 
(speaking, listening, reading, writing). Testing 
facilities are available at most British Council 
overseas offices. When you take your test, you 
should ask for a copy of your Test Report Form 
to be sent to the University. 
Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE-A)
This is administered by Pearson, and you will 
need to achieve an overall score of at least 55*, 
with at least 51 in each of the four sub-tests 
(speaking, listening, reading, writing). When you 
take your test, you should ask for a copy of your 
results to be sent to the University of Bradford 
so we can verify your score. The Pearson test 
can only be accepted for degree-level courses.
TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) 
This test is administered by the Educational 
Testing Service in the USA. You will need to 
score at least 80* and sub-tests not less than 
18 in Reading, 17 in Writing, 17 in Listening and 
20 in Speaking. If you take this test, you should 
enter the University’s code 0828 on your answer 
sheet. The TOEFL test can only be accepted for 
degree-level courses. 
Other English Language Qualifications

or Ireland for at least three years before you 
start your course, you may not need to do any 
preparatory English programmes. 
For more information, email  
thelanguagecentre@bradford.ac.uk or visit  
www.bradford.ac.uk/english-language-
requirements/
** With effect from 6 April 2015, UK Visas and 
Immigration has made changes to the Secure 
English Language Test (SELT). For Pre-sessional 
or Foundation Year applicants taking an 
English test overseas, only the UKVI approved 
Academic IELTS test offered by the IELTS SELT 
Consortium is acceptable. Please see  
www.takeielts.britishcouncil.org and  
www.gov.uk/government/publications/
guidance-on-applying-for-uk-visa-approved-
english-language-tests
I took the pre-sessional 
course to improve my 
English language as it 
was a requirement for 
my study. However, 
during the pre-sessional 
course I discovered 
that it was important 
and very useful for 
international students.

Preparing to  
study in the UK
EU and International Students
When you’re preparing for your journey to the UK, 
there are many things you will need to consider and 
organise. The University’s website offers advice and 
downloadable brochures to help you prepare for your 
studies in the UK.
Travel documents
Do you have a valid 
international passport or other 
document, which officially 
establishes your identity  
and nationality?
Make sure you record your 
name on all your documents 
exactly as it is recorded on your 
passport. Any inconsistencies 
in your documents may cause 
you problems at Immigration, 
the University and at the bank, 
if you wish to open a bank 
account in the UK.
Visa/entry clearance
Most international students 
will need to apply for Tier 4 
(General) Student visa or entry 
clearance to study in the UK. 
You can apply for your visa 
three months before the official 
start date of your course as 
stated on your offer letter.  
If you are from EEA countries* 
or a Swiss national, you can 
enter the UK freely and do  
not need to apply for a visa.  
You can enter the UK with 
a valid passport or national 
identity card.
Please ensure you have the 
latest information on visa 
application by enquiring at  
your nearest British Embassy  
or High Commission. 
Alternatively, check the UK 
Visas and Immigration website, 
www.gov.uk/government/
organisations/uk-visas-and-
immigration
Financial arrangements
It’s very important that you 
make arrangements before 
you leave home to ensure that 
you will have enough money 
to pay for your living costs and 
tuition fees. You can arrange 
to pay your tuition fees, 
accommodation fees and  
living expenses either in 
advance or on arrival, using 
any of the following methods — 
credit/debit card, bank transfer, 
cheque and banker’s draft.
When applying for your visa, 
you will need to show financial 
evidence that you have enough 
funds to cover living costs and 
tuition fees. 
If you are self-funding your 
studies, you will need to show 
that these funds have been in 
your bank account for a period 
of at least 28 days before you 
make your visa application. If 
you have an official sponsor 
who will be paying your tuition 
fees and living costs (for 
example, your Government), 
for visa purposes you will need 
to supply an official letter from 
your sponsor to confirm exactly 
how much they will be paying 
for you. If there is a difference 
between the amount your 
sponsors are paying and the 
amount required for your visa, 
this money must be in your 
bank account for a period  
of 28 days before you make 
your visa application.
* EEA countries are: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, 
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.

of any problems during your 
journey. If you are living in 
Halls of Residence, insurance 
cover for your possessions is 
usually included in your rent. 
However, you should check that 
the insurance policy offered 
will insure all your belongings. 
If you are living in private 
accommodation, it is essential 
to arrange insurance cover for 
your possessions (known as 
‘contents insurance’ or ‘student 
possessions cover’). We can 
suggest some suitable insurance 
companies to you when you 
arrive. Visit the International 
Student Information Point  
during the International  
Student Enrolment and  
Welcome Week to pick up this 
information and more.

Scholarships  
and Funding
Applying to Bradford
University scholarships 
The University awards a number of 
scholarships for academic excellence 
to self-financing EU and international 
students undertaking undergraduate 
or postgraduate studies. There 
are also a limited number of 
scholarships for students from 
developing countries and our Bestway 
Foundation Scholarships for students 
from Pakistan. 
Students from countries classified by 
the World Bank as low or low-middle 
income will receive a fee scholarship 
of £2,000 – this includes students 
from Nigeria, Pakistan and India. 
All international students on taught 
programmes are assessed for fee 
scholarships of £2,500 or £3,000 
linked to entry qualifications. There  
is a separate scholarship scheme  
for students from China. (Students 
can’t receive both of the above-
mentioned scholarships, just the  
one of the highest value to which  
they are entitled.)
For information on the different 
scholarships, criteria and  
application details, see  
www.bradford.ac.uk/scholarships 
Other scholarships and funding 
As well as the University of Bradford’s 
international scholarships, the British 
Council can advise on sources of 
financial support to international 
students. Many scholarships only 
cover postgraduate degrees; others 
cover course fees for specific 
subjects, while some are only 
available for specific institutions.

Bradford
On and around 
Campus
We’ve invested over £150 million in our bustling  
City Campus and Emm Lane Campus to make sure 
you get the most out of your time here – whether 
you’re studying, working, relaxing or playing.
Located just five minutes’ walk from Bradford  
city centre, the centrepiece of our refurbished 
campus is the three-storey Student Central 
building – the heart of student activity and  
home to University of Bradford Students’ Union.
Our new developments are among the most 
environmentally-friendly buildings in the world, 
and have seen us win numerous awards including 
the Chartered Institution of Building Services 
Engineers (CIBSE) Carbon Champion of Year 2012.
Around Campus
You can choose from a wide range of places to eat 
and drink, including the Atrium Restaurant, which 
offers vegan and halal options, and many other 
bars and cafés where you can catch up with your 
coursemates over a cappuccino or celebrate with 
friends on a night out. The campus also boasts its 
own theatre, library, art gallery and music centre.
Student Central
The Ents Mall houses four bars, a patio terrace  
and a 1,300-capacity nightclub. The Union Mall has 
open spaces for group study, student advice centres 
and a well-stocked shop. You’ll also find plenty of 
social and study spaces around the central atrium, 
with teaching rooms, a 130-seat lecture theatre, 
student services and a computer cluster.
Award-winning Facilities
Our award-winning £40 million student 
accommodation, The Green, opened  
in September 2011.
Our Fitness & Lifestyle sports centre boasts a  
range of top facilities including a gym, swimming 
pool and climbing wall, with a packed programme  
of classes, beauty treatments and children’s 
activities available at hugely competitive prices 
(visit www.bradford.ac.uk/unique for more details).
There’s also plenty of open green space for  
you to enjoy on campus, including the grass 
amphitheatre outside Student Central which  
plays host to everything from sunbathing in 
summer to sledging in winter.
Students studying Management or Law-related 
subjects study at the dedicated Emm Lane 
parkland campus, two miles (25 minutes’ walk) 
from the city centre, where beautiful historic 
buildings stand side by side with the latest  
state-of-the-art facilities. A dedicated bus service 
takes students between the Emm Lane Campus 
and the City Campus.
Accommodation
During your first year you will be guaranteed a 
place at our £40m award-winning eco-friendly 
student village, The Green. Buildings are arranged 
as a small village, with rooms available in 
apartments or townhouses. Every building meets 
the highest standards of sustainability, meaning 
it costs very little to heat and light. The Green 
has a real community feel. It is set in beautiful 
landscaped gardens, with places to relax and 
socialise. For more details about what’s  
available for our students, and for costs, visit  
www.bradford.ac.uk/accommodation
Many postgraduate students choose to live 
in privately rented accommodation. Student 
accommodation is cheaper, easier to find and  
more conveniently located in Bradford than in most 
other university cities. Many students live within 
five minutes of their lectures! Unipol Student 
Homes (www.unipol.org.uk/bradford) offers a 
free advice service to students, and is a good way 
of finding a good-quality, safe place to live at a 
reasonable cost.

Bradford and 
surroundings
Bradford is a vibrant, friendly, creative and 
cosmopolitan city with a population of over  
half a million people speaking around  
70 different languages. 
With a lively nightlife and a host of shops,  
cinemas, sporting venues and cultural  
attractions, it’s also one of the least expensive 
student cities in the UK – offering you great  
value for money too. Social life in Bradford 
thrives in the multitude of small, independent  
bars and restaurants dotted around the city centre 
which, once discovered, will become like a second  
home. You’ll also find an abundance of art,  
music and theatre on your doorstep with  
a wide variety of clubs and venues within a  
few minutes’ walk of the City Campus.
The National Media Museum is one of the most  
visited museum attractions outside London,  
while the Alhambra Theatre is a major  
touring venue offering top West End shows, 
contemporary dance and ballet. There’s  
also a wealth of grassroots culture to explore,  
from artist sound walks around historic 
Manningham to the flourishing poetry  
and local music scenes.
To support student travel around the  
city, a regular bus service links the City  
Campus to the two railway stations,  
the bus station and the city centre.
A global city
We’re a multicultural community, hosting a diverse 
range of dazzling street events and flamboyant 
festivals such as the annual Bradford Festival, a 
vibrant, colourful and multicultural programme 
of theatre, art, music and dance from around the 
world. The city’s restaurants serve up a delicious 
menu of world cuisine including Polish, Chinese, 
Italian and Middle Eastern, while our famous curry 
houses earned Bradford the title of Curry Capital 
of Britain for a record-breaking fifth year in a row 
in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.
Historically, Bradford was at the heart of the 
Industrial Revolution and its rich Victorian  
heritage is evident right across the city with  
an abundance of handsome architecture.  
More recent introductions include City Park,  
an award-winning six-acre landscaped space  
at the very heart of the city centre, featuring  
a 4,000 square metre mirror pool, spectacular  
laser light projections and over 100 fountains.
Almost three-quarters of the City of Bradford 
district is green open space. The beautifully 
landscaped Lister Park is within walking distance 
of the city centre, and is situated next to the 
University’s Faculty of Management and Law. 
The surrounding countryside is equally 
breathtaking. The towns and villages of  
Saltaire, Ilkley and Haworth are all popular  
tourist attractions that are well worth a  
visit in their own right.
74%
of the City of Bradford  
district is made up  
of green space
