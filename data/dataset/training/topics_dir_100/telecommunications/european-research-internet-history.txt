The “hidden” Prehistory of European Research Networking 
Or 
“The sad saga of the obscurantism of some European networking leaders and their influence on European 
Research Networks” 
 
Olivier H. Martin

Preface 
 
The two last decades of the twentieth century brought about a revolution in computing and 
telecommunication all over the world. From scattered small test projects that connected a few 
computers the Internet emerged as a new information and communication infrastructure. During 
this period, networks evolved from using 9.6 Kb/s links to using 2.5 Gb/s links, an incredible 
increase by a factor of 250,000. 
Email and Web search are now so ubiquitous that Googling has become a verb. Few businesses 
can run without a Web strategy and social structures like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are part 
of the daily life of a large percentage of the world population. 
Olivier Martin has focused on development in Europe and has described how Universities and 
Research Institutions led this revolution. In the process there were choices to be taken and the 
developers and policy makers in Europe were basically in two camps: those who backed de jure 
standards and the OSI development versus those who initially used ad hoc solutions and next de 
facto standards for IP. We now know that the latter group prevailed but that was certainly not 
obvious in the first years and the arguments and fighting were fierce. 
The telecommunication monopolies certainly did not make the development easier. On the 
other hand, when telecommunication liberalization came in the EU an impressive expansion in 
capacity and user numbers took off. 
Ideally, the history of war or competition should not be written by one of the participants. On 
the other hand Oliver Martin, being part of the development in the whole period, can provide a lot 
of information as well as his personal assessment of the persons involved. And, as you will see in 
the literature list, the other party has already written their version of the story.  
In addition to writing history, Olivier Martin gives some thought to future developments and, 
among other things, raises the question whether it will always be optimal to have a special 
computer network for universities and research institutions. After all, they do not have a special 
postal service or a special telephony service.

Abstract 
 
The main purpose of this article, that mostly covers the period 1984-1993, is about the history 
of European Research Networking.  In particular, this article strives to throw some light on some 
lesser known, sometimes forgotten, aspects of the European Research Networking history, as the 
EARN and EASInet initiatives from IBM but also DEC (EARN/OSI) thanks to which operational 
pan-European networks were built during the period 1984-1990 thus allowing the starting of 
operational European academic and research networking services in a very effective and swift 
manner. 
A secondary purpose of this article is to make a critical assessment of the political and 
technical achievements of the European NRENs and especially those of DANTE, the company 
setup by these same NRENs to build and operate a pan-European backbone interconnecting their 
national networking infrastructures as well as establishing international connections to other 
NRENs worldwide.  
 
Key words: BITNET, CCIRN, DANTE, DECNET, EAN, Ebone, ECFA, EARN, EUnet,

1 Introduction 
The main purpose of this article, that mostly covers the period 1980-1999, is about the history 
of European Research Networking.  
Having been a witness as well as an actor in the establishment of European Research Networks 
during the 1984-1999 periods, I believe that relating the facts as I saw them happening could be a 
valuable contribution to history, instead of the self-complacent stories that have now become 
commonplace; indeed, I do not believe that political correctness or, even worse, sheer 
propaganda is a proper way to write history.  
Therefore, this article attempts to throw some light on some lesser known, sometimes hidden, 
sometimes forgotten, aspects of the European Research Networking history, in particular, I 
believe that it is indispensable to do justice to initiatives from IBM (EARN [1], EASInet [2]) and 
DEC (EARN/OSI) through which operational pan-European networks have been launched during 
the period 1984-1990. Indeed, networking was then still in its infancy and the high related 
expenditures were difficult to justify for new services whose strategic importance still needed to 
be widely recognized. Therefore, the seed-funding from mainly IBM but also from DEC had a 
tremendous impact, allowing the starting of operational European academic and research 
networking services in a very effective manner. 
Last but not least, I want to take this opportunity to make a critical assessment of the political 
and technical achievements of the European NRENs
2
 and especially those of DANTE
3
 [3], the 
commercial company setup by these same NRENs to build and operate a pan-European backbone 
interconnecting their national networking infrastructures as well as establishing international 
connections to other NRENs worldwide.  
2 Europe’s pre-Internet Computing and Networking Situation 
There is no lack of information about this fascinating period which, as stated by John Day [4], 
an Internet pioneers, in a private email message: “Though it may be uncomfortable for some people, 
the politics of the early networking are far more interesting and not what most people think”. 
Data networks did not start with the Internet in the late 1980s, however the use of data 
networks was only prevalent in specific communities (e.g., large multinational corporations, 
mission oriented communities (e.g. Space, HEP, Magnetic Fusion); this being said, networks in 
its wider sense have been pervasive in the 20
th
 century, water, telephone, electricity, radio, TV, 
roads, railways, sewers, etc., therefore many efforts were spent towards reusing existing networks 
(e.g. ADSL/Telephony) rather than building new expensive ones, e.g. FTTx
4
 [5]. 
The pre-Internet period was therefore extremely challenging with a diversity of: 
1. Networking technology, usually proprietary solutions (IBM’s NJE5, SNA6 and RSCS7, 
DECnet, Novell) but also FIDOnet, UUCP, etc.

2. Mail addresses and file transfer protocols, hence the need for translators/gateways in 
order to interwork, in turn creating electronic mail loops, long communication delays, 
poor reliability, etc. SPAM [6] only came later.  
In short, we now live in a kind of dream networking world where Internet access is nearly 
ubiquitous and Internetworking 
has become so simple, thanks to 
the use of sophisticated search 
engines like Google and Web 
browsers [7], so that few people 
are even aware of the existence of 
an underlying network. The only 
significant problem left, as far as 
users are concerned, is Quality of 
Service, especially when watching 
live audio/video streams. 
 The enclosed chart that  was 
extracted from Hobbes’ Internet 
Timeline by Robert Zakon
8
 [8] 
shows very well the exponential 
growth of the Internet from 1990, 
the corresponding stagnation and 
finally the demise of 
EARN/BITNET in 1995, the 
ephemeral emergence of OSI
9
 
[9][10] in  a few countries and the lasting existence of both Fidonet and UUCP through the 1990s. 
 
I found the following three documents of particular interest: 
1. “Notable computer networks” [11] by John S. Quarterman  [12]  and Josiah C. Hoskins 
(1986) 
2. “European International Academic Networking: A 20 years Perspective” [13] by Peter 
T. Kirstein (UCL) 
3. Exploring the Internet: “A Technical Travelogue” [14] by Carl Malamud [15] 
 
2.1 “Notable computer networks” 
The network taxonomy used is very unusual as it distinguishes “Research Networks” 
(ARPANET), “Company Networks” (Xerox, DEC, IBM, AT&T), “Cooperative Networks” 
(BITNET/EARN, UUCP/USENET), “Commercial Networks” (e.g. COMPUSERVE [16], 
TYMNET [17], TELENET [18], Telephone Networks) and “Meta-Networks”, i.e. networks 
attempting to assemble dissimilar networks (in 1986, CSNET was the only operational example, 
however, NSFNET and RARE are also quoted).

The article as a whole is extremely informative as it provides information about networks that 
have long been forgotten already! Figure 2 provides the time lines for development of “Notable 
Computer Networks” during the period 1969 through 1986. Though there may  still be some 
isolated use of DECNET, UUCP and RSCS, it is interesting to note that, off the 10 families of 
networks considered, only the ARPANET branch survived through NSFnet and what is now 
known as “The Internet”, which gives some credibility to Larry Landweber’s very bold 
conclusion in his keynote speech [19] at the Euroview 2010 conference titled “The Future 
(Inter)Network: challenges and paradigms” as very realistic: “in the future, i.e. beyond 2030, 
world, IP, much like SNA, X.25, etc., will be largely forgotten”. What Larry means, of course, is 
that the successor of IP will be completely different from IPv4, in other words, he implies that 
IPv6 may not make it which may or may not turn out to be true. In any case, few people know 
about IP as such, the only thing they know about is “The Internet” and the Internet will, for sure, 
survive, as the underlying protocol only matters to the only the Internet architects. 
The CYCLADES [20] packet switching network deserves special mention as it is generally 
considered as having had a profound influence on the design of the second generation ARPANET 
by moving the reliability of data from the network to the hosts and thus introducing packet 
numbering and windowing concepts. It is not widely known that there have been two versions of 
ARPANET, the 1
st
 one based on NCP and IMP, the 2
nd
 one without IMPs and based on TCP/IP, a 
“fatal” mistake according to John Day as “when NCP was shut down, the internetwork layer got lost 
and the Internet became a concatenation of IP networks with an end to end transport layer on top.” 
The CYCLADES had influence on the 2
nd
 generation ARPANET that marked the start of the 
Internet. Further explanations can be found in chapter 19.2.2. CYCLADES was designed by IRIA 
the predecessor of INRIA [21] under the direction of Louis Pouzin [22] and was considered as a 
“renegade” by the supporters of “circuit oriented networks”. A continued collaboration between 
the ARPANET and CYCLADES teams could have changed the course of European Research 
Networking with increased cooperation between Europe and the USA; unfortunately it did not 
happen! However, the concepts of CYCLADES and CIGALE, the packet layer, were used in the 
EIN
10
 project [23] [24] led by Derek Barber (NPL
11
), a colleague of Donald Davies that is 
generally considered as one the three inventors of packet switching.  
Although the contributions of Louis Pouzin to the Internet have long been underestimated or 
even ignored, this unfair situation was corrected in 1997 where the SIGCOMM Award [25] was 
presented jointly to Jonathan B. Postel of the USC ISI
12
, and to Louis Pouzin
13
. 
During the FIA
14
 meeting [26] in Budapest in May 2011, John Day gave an excellent keynote 
speech titled “Back to the Future: A Journey from Science to Craft . . . and Back?” [27], where he 
relates the ARPANET and CYCLADES work. 
Last but not least, the respective roles of Louis Pouzin, Rémi Després and Hubert Zimmermann  
is clarified by Vint Cerf [28] in Nethistory.info [29]: “On the design of TCP/IP”, whose excerpts 
can be found in chapter 19.2.3.1. In particular, the position of Louis Pouzin regarding the

 “Louis Pouzin is best known for his work as the inventor and advocate of "Datagrams", later extended and renamed 
connectionless communication, as the basic mode for the transmission of packets in a network. His ideas in this area 
paved the way for a new thread of thought on how to manage resources in networks, resulting in several major 
innovations, including today's ATM networks. During the 1970s, Louis was a strong focal point for cooperation 
between research and industry, between Europe and North America, and between the computer community, the 
datacom community and the more traditional telecommunications community.”

implementation of virtual circuits/connections at the transport rather than at the network layer is 
unambiguously described. 
There are also three excellent history articles by Valérie Schafer that are apparently not 
available in English but can, however, be translated from French to English by Google, about:  
1.1. The move from mainframes with locally or remotely connected terminals to general 
purpose networks [30] 
1.2. The EIN project [31]; there are troubling similarities between EIN and EARN with 
respect to the position of the CEPT, namely:  “While CEPT recognizes the value and 
importance of the EIN experiment, it notes that this network should not normally be allowed to 
grow or even be kept in service, as a private network, beyond the experimental phase of five years 
under the agreement and the completion of which should normally take place in February 1978. 
Also, members of CEPT intend "to limit the experimental authorization of the circuits designed 
to provide interconnection between these centers."  
In other words, the PTTs firmly intended to keep their monopoly on transmission lines. 
1.3. The EURONET project [32] marked the end of the EIN project and the victory of the 
PTTs with the advent of X.25 [33] based, i.e. virtual circuits, networks. 
2.2 “European International Academic Networking: A 20 years 
Perspective” 
Although the article by P. Kirstein is really excellent and provides a wealth of useful 
references, it is a little too focused on UCL and the UK, but this article is also very focused on 
CERN as it is preferable to relate the facts to which we have participated!  
As rightly pointed out by P. Kirstein, there was a continuous dilemma on both sides of the 
Atlantic on the “vexing question” of “Networks for researchers versus networks for researchers 
in networks”. What happened with European NRENs is clearly the former, namely the provision 
of Internet services with a particular focus on interconnecting Universities
15
, while “the USA 
always made a fairly sharp separation between academic work in network research and 
provision of network facilities. This is the reason that DARPA was happy to support SATNET, 
Packet Radio Net and the Internet in its early stages but then to withdraw from these in favor of 
NSF who commissioned NSFNET, which was then transitioned into the private sector”. However, 
as most researchers needed much higher performance facilities than the commercial Internet was 
then able to provide, the Abilene [34] backbone was deployed by Internet2 “in order to enable 
the higher-speed applications to run while also serving as a testbed  for the  deployment of IPv6, 
QoS
16
, Multicast and many other important functions.” 
The above article contains a lot of information about the US connections to Europe, in 
particular the ARPANET connections through SATNET, as well as the UK networking scene 
(SERCNET, JANET [130], etc.), other satellite projects such as STELLA [35] and SILK [36], the 
role of the European Commission (EC) through the various, ACTS
17
 [37], COST [38], ESPRIT
18
 
                                                 
15
 Nonetheless, the NRENs feeling was that they had to also get involved in research for networks because of the lack 
of standards and products but they would claim that the object of the exercise was for the benefit of users. But EARN 
would demonstrate that the benefit of the users can be trumped by politics, namely the provision of network services 
with a particular focus on interconnecting Universities

As noted by P. Kirstein, it is particularly impressive to observe that over a 25 years period the 
bandwidth increased from 9.6 Kb/s in the early 1980 to 10Gb/s in the mid-2000, i.e. a factor 
1,000,000 in less than 25 years! 
2.3 Exploring the Internet: “A Technical Travelogue” 
The narrative style of this book whose electronic copies are freely available is most informative 
about the atmosphere of the early 1990s. In the preface to the electronic version Carl Malamud 
starts by writing that “I didn't censor myself, and wrote a fairly straightforward narrative. I did leave one 
thing out, though. When I was in Switzerland, I stopped by CERN to learn about X.400 mail gateways, a 
concept that has become as relevant to today's Internet as the rest of OSI. Brian Carpenter suggested that I 
stop by a lab and look at a little program running on a NeXT computer. There, I met Tim Berners-Lee who 
showed me his not-yet-announced concoction, the World Wide Web. Interesting little program, I thought to 
myself, but not very relevant. My thought, as I walked out of the office was "it won't scale," so I left it out of 
this book. Every time I hear a pundit with a definite opinion, I remember that experience. We are all still 
trying to understand the implications of the Internet and anybody who has the answers is asking the wrong 
questions.” 
The “Travelogue” is organized in three successive “Rounds”, themselves divided according to 
the chronological order of the visited cities. I particularly recommend the Amsterdam sections in 
Round one, which gives some details about the creation of Ebone, and Round two (11
th
 RIPE 
meeting” where it is written that RIPE “was formed as a sort of anti-organization, a reaction to the 
total ineffectiveness of other groups in setting up a pan-European Internet. At the time RIPE was formed, 
there had been several years of thrashing while people tried to figure out how to make OSI into something 
real”. But the Amsterdam [47], Berlin, Bonn [48], Geneva and Utrecht sections are well worth 
reading too; the Geneva sections deal mostly with repeated contacts with Tony Rutkowski (ITU) 
about standards but also a visit at CERN.  
Overall, this book is very refreshing
21
 and I was amazed to find that many of the observations 
made matched my own, despite the fact that I came across that book after having written this 
article!  
The conversation with Klaus Birkenbihl about EARN, EASInet but also AGFnet and WIN is 
particularly interesting: “This private network, AGFnet, was not OSI (in fact it was SNA [50]), but at 
least it contained X.25, the "pathway to OSI," to make it politically palatable to the bureaucracy. What 
AGFnet did do was prod DFN into action
22
, which resulted in a national X.25 network called 
Wissenschaftsnetz (WIN or "science network")” 
2.4 The European Networking scene 
In the 1980-1988 periods, there was a lack of open networking options; indeed, apart from 
CCITT standards X.25 
 
[33], there was a lack of international standards at layer 3 and above. 
However, telephony and data transmission standards, such as SONET
23
/SDH
24
 [49], were widely 
used as the need to offer global services was obvious. Therefore, the norm rather than the

exception was to use proprietary protocols. IBM with SNA 
 
[50] and/or RSCS [51], DEC
25 
[52] 
with DECNET
 
[53] were then very popular and were sort of “de facto” industry standards with 
emulation software
 
[54] available on most hardware platforms. However, there was no lack of 
other proprietary solutions like, HP
 
[55], Apollo
 
[56] with Apollo domain
 
[57], Novell
 
[58] with 
IPX [59], a protocol actually derived from Xerox XNS
 
[60], NetBIOS
 
[61], Norsk Data
 
[62], SUN
 
[63], Microsoft’s NWLink
26 
[64] [65], etc.
 
Unlike other manufacturers and despite some pre-announcement about a worldwide IPX 
 
[66] 
(actually Novell) network, Microsoft finally had the wisdom to adopt TCP/IP as its default 
network protocol.  
In some specific cases (e.g., the emerging UNIX and PC worlds) solutions like UUCP 
 
[67] or 
FIDOnet [68] could be used.  
It is interesting to note that private “company networks”
27
, e.g. AT&T, DEC (EASYnet), IBM 
(VNET) and Xerox, predated by many years the development of academic networks, in contrast 
to the generally held view that the network development process was entirely controlled by the 
academic community
28
. 
Apart from X.25, the glaring lack of open communications standards in the early 1980s created 
very difficult problems in heterogeneous hardware environments such as CERN; therefore, there 
were numerous attempts to specify and implement your own protocols and networks, e.g. 
CERNET.  
Otherwise, there were basically three possible choices for deploying “open networks”: 
1) Use the US developed TCP/IP protocols, which was seen by many Europeans as “anti-
patriotic” (sic) but also risky, not being developed according to the regular Standards 
organizations manner! Furthermore, as the penetration of UNIX, upon which TCP/IP 
was layered, was very small outside University’s Computer Science Departments and 
the UUCP community, it was basically irrelevant in the early 1980s. 
2) Use their UK counterpart the, so called, “Coloured Book” [69] that, apart from the 
“Grey book
29
” (email), were basically orthogonal
30
 to TCP/IP making use, in 
particular, of X.25 at the network layer. However, this was also risky as the future of 
the “Coloured Book”, that were only meant to be “interim standards” was, by 
definition, very uncertain. According to Paul Bryant “In very early discussion with 
Francois Fluckiger there were some hopes that we could get some Coloured book/X25 
presence at CERN. Curiously, we were quite reluctant to push our protocols abroad feeling 
that each country had to find its own salvation. They would sell on their own merits.” 
3) Rely on the emerging ISO/OSI protocol suite that was still in a very immature state, to 
say the least! Thus, although the OSI protocols had undoubtedly a lot of appeal in the 
early 1980s, it was not only unrealistic but also totally irresponsible to propose them 
in the late 1980s as an operationally viable solution.  
Unfortunately, given the slow pace of development of the ISO/OSI standards making process, 
the inevitable happened, namely the rapid acceptance of the open TCP/IP protocol suite in the late

1980s thanks to their implementation on diverse hardware and software platforms and despite 
numerous devious political manipulations to prevent the adoption of US protocols by Europe.  
Although, this may appear to be slightly off subject in a chapter dedicated to the European 
networking scene, it is worth reminding that DARPA had established connections with five 
European institutions, including UCL (London) that was providing a gateway service to the UK 
academic community, thus there was good knowledge of the capabilities as well as the lack of 
maturity of these protocols in the early 1980s. Indeed, the basic DARPA Internet protocols as we 
know them today, i.e. datagram (i.e. packet) at layer 3 (IP) and end-to-end connection at layer 4 
(TCP), were only documented in RFC 791 (IP) [70] and RFC 793 (TCP) [71] in September 1981 
and deployed across ARPANET [72] in 1983. However, as observed by P. Kirstein, ARPANET 
was only one of three networks using the DARPA Internet Protocol suite, the other two being 
PRNET [73] and SATNET [74] [75]. UCL that was part of SATNET started to run their 
operational service based on the new TCP/IP specifications
31
 as early as 1982, i.e. a year before it 
went live on ARPANET. Needless to say, as explained by P. Kirstein in his most instructive 
article “Early Experiences with the ARPANET and INTERNET in the UK” [76] he had to face 
difficult times with the British authorities as well as the academic community that were backing 
International Standards through BSI
32
 participation to CCITT and ISO: “The British were 
embarking during this period on their “Coloured Book” protocols; the Europeans (including the UK) were 
developing different sets under first the EIN [31]and later EURONET [32] projects. The European 
networks were not really kept going very long, did not have a large set of computers, and did not have 
long-term funding. As a result the European efforts did not lead to any strong standards - except at Level 2, 
where they led to the X.25 protocols [33] that became the main European data networks for the next fifteen 
to twenty years.” Peter Kirstein’s observation about EIN and EURONET is perfectly right, as these 
networks had few, if any real users and they were mostly used as “proof of network technology” 
real scale test-beds, whereas the strength of ARPANET but also HEPNET, SRCNET, EARN and 
EUNET is that they were providing real services to users. 
 
As ARPANET 
 
had restricted access use, CSNET 
 
[77], the Computer Science Network, 
initiated by Larry Landweber from Wisconsin University in 1980 met rapid acceptance and 
received NSF funding during the 1981-1984 period. However, despite  its fast growing popularity 
within the US academic computer science community, CSNET, was far from being an undisputed 
success because of the immaturity of the Internet routing protocols, in particular, and because of 
the limited bandwidth available (i.e. 56Kb/s and 9.6Kb/s circuits). In 1986 CSNET was funded by 
the NSFnet Programme as a community network / regional network in the NSFnet’s three tier 
model of campus networks / regional, community and supercomputer centre networks / and the 
NSFnet backbone.  The interim NSFnet backbone went into service in April 1986, and was 
upgraded in 1987 was replaced in 1989 by NSFNET 
 
[78], a 1.5 Mb/s (T1) 
 
[79] backbone. The 
NSFnet Programme, initiated in 1985, was the first general purpose national TCP/IP inter-
network and marked the real start of the Internet.   
3 CERN 
CERN deserves a special chapter given its special, not to say central, role in European 
networking history, being already one of the main worldwide sources of scientific data in the 
mid-1970s. As stated by Carl Malamud in [48]: “CERN was sometimes referred to as the Center 
for European Research Networking”. The geographical distribution of the CERN user community 
                                                 
31
 These included among other things the concept of windowing which was critical for satellite based communications 
because of the inherent 500 milliseconds round-trip-time.

is inherent to the organizational structure of the laboratory, in which CERN builds and operates 
the particle accelerators while the collaborating High Energy Physics (HEP) institutes design the 
detectors, run the experiments and analyze their results.  There is a similar style of working in 
other particle accelerator centers around the world (e.g., Brookhaven 
 
[80], Fermilab 
 
[81], KEK 
 
[82] and SLAC
33
 [83]) and there is also a long established tradition within this community to 
work in a collaborative manner as reported by Paul Kunz (SLAC) in his very informative “Status 
of Networking for High Energy Physics in the United States” report [84]. 
In order to make this collaboration as effective as possible, the HEP user community as well as 
other communities, e.g., the Space community with NSI
34
 and SPAN (Space Physics Analysis 
Network), the Astronomers community (JIVE
 
[85]) were early users of advanced 
telecommunication services, which  justified the establishment of mission oriented networks such 
as MFEnet
35
 but also, as described by François Fluckiger in “HEPnet in Europe: Status and 
Trends”, HEPNET [86], a star shaped network around CERN, as there was no suitable general 
purpose network available. HEP and SPAN subsequently agreed to form a single wide area 
DECNET network dubbed HEP/SPAN
36
.  
It is interesting to note that in the pre-HEPNET and pre-EARN eras (i.e.1980), CERN only had 
two analog 9.6 Kb/s lines to CEA
37
 in Saclay [87] and RAL
38
 near Oxford [88], with essentially 
one full time person to ensure “stable” operations (i.e. fixing bugs, liaising with the PTTs in case 
of line outages, etc.). 
A unique aspect of CERN during the 1970-1990 periods was intellectual freedom with its 
corollary of internal ideological battles and the establishment of independently managed 
“empires”. Coupled to the fact that the four LEP
 
[89] experiments were both competing
39 
between 
themselves and largely independent of CERN, these were major factors stimulating innovation 
that, in turn, greatly contributed to the richness and the diversity of the whole environment (e.g., 
general purpose LAN, dedicated accelerator control network, experiment specific data acquisition 
and filtering systems, etc.). No wonder therefore that in such a burgeoning environment with so 
many diverse, sometimes conflicting, requirements independently managed LAN islands 
appeared, such as: Ethernet (shared, switched), IBM Token Ring
 
[90], FDDI
40 
[91], Ultranet [92], 
Apollo Domain, Norsk Data, etc. However, the use of Ultranet, a proprietary 1Gb/s interface 
developed to fill a technological gap above 10Mb/s Ethernet and FDDI (100 Mb/s) in the late 
1980s, when 1Gb/s Ethernet interfaces were not yet commercially available, did not bring the 
expected benefits as Ethernet technology caught up quickly.  
The CERN Computer Centre had the same problem with successive generation of computers 
from IBM, Control Data Corporation 
 
[93] (CDC) 6600 then 7600, IBM again quickly 
complemented by IBM compatible (i.e. Fujitsu/Siemens), then CRAY 
 
[94]. Interestingly enough, 
it is the introduction of a Cray XMP 
 
[95] which actually popularized the use of UNIX [96] and 
later LINUX 
 
[97] at CERN.

 Fiber Distributed Data Interface

In 1990, the SHIFT (Scalable Heterogeneous Integrated FaciliTy) project 
 
[98] marked the start 
of a new paradigm, namely: moving away from very expensive mainframes towards distributed 
high performance RISC [99] CPUs with much better price/performance characteristics, thus 
paving the way to “Commodity computing [100]”. Subsequently SHIFT received a 21st Century 
Achievement Award 
 
 [101] from the Computerworld Honors Program. In 1993, the EC funded 
BETEL project extended SHIFT to CCPN 
 
[102], the IN2P3 
 
[103] computer center in Lyon. In 
some sense, SHIFT, together with BETEL, can be seen as precursors of the GRID. 
 “Computing at CERN in the LEP era (May 1983)”, better known as the “Green Book” [104], 
was followed in 1988 by the “MUSCLE” [105] report which was focused on networking. The 
presentation made by David Williams during the LEP festivity 
 
[106] in 2000 is particularly 
interesting. 
The “MUSCLE” report made the case for 2Mb/s circuits between CERN and the main LEP 
computing centers (IN2P3 (Lyon), CEA, CNAF (Bologna) [107],  CASPUR
41
 (Roma) [108] , 
ETH
42
 (Zurich) [109], etc. in order to exchange experimental LEP data. In practice, the 
“MUSCLE” recommendations were largely implemented thanks to IBM’s EASInet initiative, 
however, the network could not be used to disseminate the LEP data as originally anticipated 
given that the available bandwidth between CERN and the main LEP computing centers was far 
too small (i.e. 2Mb/s at best): so one had to wait 20 more years, i.e. until LHC and the LHCOPN 
 
[110], to make this dream finally become reality! Indeed, until approximately 2008, the 
bandwidth available to the HEP community was insufficient to allow the transfer of the LEP 
experimental data therefore only the calibration and some mini-DSTs could be shipped across the 
network. However, shipping tapes by postal mail was also expensive, and several studies proved 
that, under some slightly “biased” hypothesis such as “near real time” access to experimental 
LHC data (i.e. 1-2 days), high-speed 10 Gb/s networks were actually cheaper than making 
massive and regular use of FedEx style services.  
CERN was also involved in two high-speed data transmission over satellite projects, namely: 
STELLA 
 
[111] and CHEOPS 
 
[112] (using ESA’s Olympus Satellite). There is an excellent 
article by Brian Carpenter 
 
[113] describing the purposes and status of CHEOPS.  
Although these projects were technically very interesting and successfully demonstrated the 
feasibility of using satellites for high speed data transmissions before TCP‘s “windows scale” 
option became available [114], they essentially led nowhere, practically speaking, though they 
mobilized some of the best European networking experts! 
Therefore CERN was to some extent relieved when the Olympus 
 
[115] satellite disappeared 
from its orbit as, in exchange for free access to this satellite, CERN had, if not a contractual, at 
least a moral obligations to make use of Olympus, in order to demonstrate the use of satellite for 
high-speed transfers of LEP experimental data (Data Summary Tapes), à la STELLA, between 
CERN and three computing centers located in Finland, Greece and Portugal. However, CERN 
saved its technical credibility as the feasibility of the project had been demonstrated, whereas the 
operational phase which was due to last several years never happened for reasons beyond 
CERN’s control. 
In the CS group but also within the LEP experiments, there was some dislike of IBM, the “Big 
Blue” [116] company, the “evil” monopoly, so to speak, whereas DEC, together with its 
integrated networking solution, DECNET, was then extremely popular within the LEP
 
[117] 
experiments with PDP and later VAX “superminicomputers”
 
[118], and was therefore perceived 
as a “good company.

Indeed, DEC was then a very dynamic and innovative company and was one of the initiators of 
both distributed computing and Ethernet
43
, although the DEC flavor of Ethernet, that was in wide 
use in University campuses, had a different frame format than the one standardized later by IEEE. 
Nonetheless, DEC was truly committed to open standards, e.g. DECNET/OSI transition, that 
actually never happened because of unforeseen technical difficulties and was also instrumental in 
the support of the EARN/OSI transition plan 
 
[119]. 
3.1 CERNET 
Given the lack of open communications standards and the extremely heterogeneous hardware 
environment at CERN, it was very natural in the late 1970s to specify and implement your own 
network protocols. 
CERNET is a typical example of a design by committee project. By the time the specifications 
were finished and the CERN-wide internal network implemented, it became  obvious that many 
features were missing (e.g., Terminal Access hence a Virtual terminal Protocol (VTP) was 
implemented on top of CERNET); furthermore, the network was, in practice, very little used until 
some new un-envisaged applications came up, e.g., bridging Ethernet across CERNET 
(FRIGATE [120]), implementing high speed remote printing through CHIMP [121] (CERN High 
speed Inter Mainframe Program
44
), that met immediate success despite the fact that the 
consumption of CPU resources was far too high for the CPU limited mainframes of those times!  
The fact that CERN was using INDEX, a popular dumb terminal switching system from 
Gandalf
45
 Technologies (Canada), partly explains the reasons behind the lack of remote login 
facilities in CERNET; in addition, CERNET was built to interconnect computers not terminals. 
Admittedly, gathering the needs of the users, be they physicists, was very difficult, if not 
impossible, in the early computing and networking ages, where the predominant model was a 
highly centralized one based on mainframes with home-made RIOS
46
 providing job submission 
and printing facilities site-wide. 
Furthermore, in the CERN multi-vendor environment proprietary solutions could not be 
applied on a wide scale therefore, home-made solutions had to be developed. Likewise, the 
functionality of commercial software (e.g. network management) and/or operating systems were 
rather primitive and CERN had to extend/develop several basic components (e.g., new drivers, 
improved schedulers, new utility programs like FIND [122]). 
4 European Committee for Future Accelerators  (ECFA): Subgroup 5 
(Links and Networks)  
ECFA [123] Subgroup 5 assembled an exceptionally bright set of people like, the late Mike 
Sendall, boss of Tim Berners Lee, the initiator of the Web; Rob Blokzijl, who became the 
chairman of RIPE; James Hutton, who became the first secretary general of RARE; Paul Bryant, 
                                                 
43
 together with Intel and Xerox, the, so called, DIX standard, i.e. 10Mb/s Ethernet than later became IEEE 802.3 
44
 implemented in Pascal by Geerd Hoffman who joined the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts 
(ECMWF) afterwards 
45
 Quoting Paul Bryant again: “RAL also had a Gandalf exchange: A massive machine and a step in the wrong 
direction. However, at that time terminals were all the rage. No doubt you can remember the coax cables needed for 
the IBM 3270? We went in for an asynchronous 3270 emulator that was far cheaper and went over Gandalf. 
Interestingly, the early Ethernet Ungermann-Bass product [125] was sold as a terminal system by providing terminal 
concentrators.”

who became chairman of the EARN Technical Committee and was the father of the EARN/OSI 
(i.e. X.25) transition [124]; Brian Gilmore who became Chairman of the TERENA Technical 
Committee; Enzo Valente (Chairman of GARR); the late Jacques Prevost (RARE WG6 chair); 
François Flückiger
47
 (CERN).  
 
François Fluckiger was then a very strong proponent as well as a very persuasive advocate of 
an “all X.25” strategy and played a decisive role in its introduction at CERN, as well as inside the 
emerging HEPnet as the “Universal” networking solution.  
 
In fact, this position was not particularly original because there was not much else available! 
 
Indeed, ECFA WG5 quickly became convinced that public X.25 networks could serve as the 
basis of the HEPnet backbone; however, public X.25 services were horrendously expensive as 
there was no flat charging but telephone-like usage-based charging; in addition, CERN’s 
connection to Telepac
48
 was only 48 Kb/s. Therefore HEPnet quickly realized the financial 
drawbacks of public X.25 and moved into private X.25 leased lines. While public X.25 was well 
suited to the remote login style of operation of HEP but not much else, private X.25 could also be 
used as DECNET or even TCP/IP transport, however, native operations could also be provided in 
a more flexible and efficient manner through the use of “intelligent” statistical multiplexors such 
as Stratacom 
 
[126], IDNX 
 
[127], etc. 
The work of ECFA subgroup 5 is another excellent example of where “top-down design by 
committee” can lead to, namely the assembling of a bright set of personalities with strong and 
innovative, though not necessarily either right or convergent views! 
There is only a subset of the ECFA subgroup 5 reports available from the CERN document 
store 
 
[128] but two reports are of particular historical interest: “Networks for High-Energy 
Physics” (August 1982) and “Progress towards Networking Facilities for High Energy Physics” 
(September 1983). 
The first report 
 
[129] laid the founding principles of HEPNET, namely:  
1. Wide area communication by network or leased lines should use the X25 access protocol. 
2. Communication should normally be via the Public X25 services, particularly for international 
traffic. Cost studies have shown
49
 that leased lines tend to be more expensive than the public 
network unless the line capacity is heavily used. For international traffic, PTT regulations appear 
to prevent general HEP usage of private networks
50
.    
3. All HEP institutes should attach themselves to their national X25 network when available, both for 
computer-computer traffic and for terminals. 
4. Interactive terminal access should use the X3, X28, X29 (“Triple X”) standards, after study and 
agreement on the particular dialect
51
 of triple X to be used by HEP. 
5. The main HEP institutes and supporting centers should agree on a short/medium term project for 
the development and installation of File Transfer Protocol converters between the existing 
systems. 
6. Studies should continue on the possibilities of converging towards the general use of international 
higher level protocols as they become known.

 A very diplomatic way of expressing the difficulties of defining a common “dialect” out of the proliferation of 
options available in most International Standards, resulting from their “political nature”, e.g. X.25 had a “datagram 
mode” that, to the best of my knowledge, was never used!

The above recommendations appear to have been strongly influenced by François Fluckiger as 
well as by the UK scientific community that was then well ahead of everybody else in Europe, 
with an already well developed, “Coloured Book” [69] protocols based, network funded by SRC
52
 
and initially dubbed SRCNET
53
, then SERCNET
54
 and finally JANET
55
 [130]. The network was 
given to the JNT
56
 that later became UKERNA, and after that SERC part funded the network 
together with the universities.  
 
As mentioned earlier, these protocols were only meant to be used as interim “standards” and 
were actually fed into the ISO standards making process through BSI.  
 
Regarding recommendation #2 (use of public X.25 networks), Paul Bryant believes that it was 
essentially a political posture: “we all made promises for the future on the use of the public networks in 
the hope that by the time we had to fulfill the promise things would have moved on - particularly the people 
making the promises. EARN was just the same. The interesting difference with EARN was that when we 
decided to fulfill our promise
57
 we found that the receivers of the promise suddenly found that they did not 
want us to fulfill the promise our way but their way, that is, to use the public networks or some yet to 
emerge academic infrastructure.” 
 
The report goes on with a definition of four classes of services named: N-HEPNET, I-HEPNET, 
F-HEPNET and M-HEPNET where N, I, F and M stand for Network, Interactive, File transfer 
and job submission, Mail, and teleconferencing, services respectively.  The report built on the fact 
that existing 9.6 Kb/s analog lines were indeed very expensive and not error free, whereas public 
X25 networks held the promises of much higher access speeds, i.e. 48 Kb/s, with better 
performance at a better price; however, the reality turned out to be quite different!  
As a matter of fact sections 3.1.1.3 “Costs and Tariffs” and 3.1.1.4 “The Impact of New PTT 
Services” are a masterpiece of “biased” information aimed to promoting the use of public X.25 
networks. 
The second report [131] edited by Paul Van Binst is actually much more interesting as it 
provides an excellent overview of the networking situation within the HEP community and the 
development of commercial X.25 networks worldwide. There is also detailed information about 
the projected functionality of F-HEPNET that was later renamed GIFT
58
 and implemented on a 
VAX/VMS system at CERN, but was neither very much used nor fully functional either! 
A third ECFA Subgroup 5 report titled “Report on Results of Questionnaire on Links and 
Networks” [132] was published in October 1983 by A.P. White from Imperial College (London) 
and is a very interesting testimony of the state of use of networks inside the HEP community (154 
institutes contacted, 48 replies received) with the following main findings: back in 1982 most 
HEP users already had access to terminal, file transfer and job submission/retrieval facilities, 
however their use was rather low, nonetheless use of electronic mail was starting through three 
main systems: Wylbur, VAX/VMS, UK SERCNET (i.e. Grey Book). One of the most surprising 
answers is that only 33% of the respondents foresaw a definite need for “regular transfer of large 
amounts of data over existing or future network” whereas 41% saw no need! But, who could have 
reasonably foreseen that the world of telecommunications would evolve so quickly and that the

prices would literally collapse in those days where the typically cost of a trans-border 9.6 Kb/s 
line in Europe was of the order of 100KUSD/year 
The ECFA networking strategy documents were published just before EARN
59
 came about 
which messed up the whole thing, though it accelerated the creation of the RARE association; 
indeed, an informal workshop on research networking was held in May 1985 in Luxembourg with 
representatives of 12 countries (CERN included) where it was proposed to form a European 
association to foster research ISO/OSI networking! Thanks to Paul Bryant, who happened to be 
the secretary of this very informative, but also historical, meeting the minutes are available at 
[133].  
 
Quoting Paul Bryant again: “The meeting was set up by James Hutton (ECFA), Peter Linington 
(JANET), Nick Newman (EEC
60
 [134]), so that we could get funding, and myself as one of the conveners. 
There is absolutely no doubt that EARN was a major influence bearing in mind the threat of a dreaded IBM 
world domination.” 
4.1 HEPNET 
CERN played a central role in the European networking history being one of the main sources 
of data worldwide (i.e. multiple Petabytes
61
/year in 2011 [135]); this sheer fact was the 
justification for a mission oriented High Energy Physics Network (HEPnet) centered around 
CERN where all related costs were borne by the requesting institutes which suited everybody, as 
CERN had no say about what amount of bandwidth was needed to connect a particular HEP 
institute and was in a kind of “slave” mode. 
There is a very informative 1989 article written by Brian Carpenter and François Fluckiger 
titled “European HEPNET - Where we are and where are we going?” [136], presenting the 
structure as well as the status of HEPNET with interesting statements about the state of the 
DECNET Phase V transition seen as a catalyst towards the wide adoption of OSI, as well as the 
end of the GIFT gateway at CERN.  
HEPNET was perceived as a threat by the emerging NRENs, as well as by DANTE, that were 
well aware of this situation and firmly believed, as networking was still in a very early phase, that 
they absolutely needed to incorporate the HEP community into their nascent infrastructure, in 
order to have some significant amount of traffic from the beginning, and thus justify the 
investment. There was also a hidden agenda item which was to bring the HEP community under 
their control in order to jugulate it.  
However, having fought hard in order to fund HEPNET the physicists were little inclined to 
put this funding into a general purpose network, especially as the capacity of these new emerging 
networks was very small. IXI
62
, a 64Kb/s X.25 backbone, was preceded by a pilot service whose 
main characteristic was that it had no or little traffic.  
Indeed, real traffic was carried out by EARN and EUnet and it was hard for the few X.400 
aficionados to make full use of it, fortunately EUnet that was pioneering the use of TCP/IP over 
                                                 
59
 Towards the end of 1983, IBM took the initiative of establishing and funding EARN. A network conceptually similar   
to BITNET linking selected computer centers via, mostly 9.6 Kb/s, leased lines. 
60
 European Economic Community, the predecessor of the EC (European Community), also named EU (European 
Union), after the Maastricht treaty  (1993) 
61
 2 to the 50th power, or 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes. 
62
 The International X.25 Infrastructure (IXI) pilot service had emerged from the COSINE project. IXI started service 
between all the COSINE countries in July 1990, i.e. after Killarney meeting.  The service was provided by PTT 
Telecom (Netherlands) under a contract with the European Commission. It provided an X.25 service at 64kbps to 18 
access points and also had connections to the public X.25 services in nine countries. 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 20 
X.25 in Europe was well 
positioned to make use of IXI by 
connecting backbone sites in low 
volume countries that would not 
have sufficient traffic to warrant 
leased lines. 
That way there was some constant 
traffic load at least and the IXI 
folk could claim usefulness by 
usage
63
. The sad reality, though, 
was that, whereas everybody else 
was already in the 2Mb/s era in 
the late 1980s, the only thing 
RARE/IXI could offer in the early 
1990s was a pitiful 64 Kb/s 
backbone that was skillfully 
presented as a major political 
achievement, that it probably was, 
but certainly not a significant 
technical achievement. One result 
of this conflictive atmosphere as 
well as the new, very strict, 
hierarchical networking structure 
was that the “poor user” only had 
indirect access to other networks. 
If anything went wrong then he 
had to go via its NREN that 
would go to IXI and so on. Thus, 
the time to get a response and 
whether the response would be 
useful tended to create the lack of 
trust. 
Spurred by SURFnet’s Ebone 
initiative, it took another two 
years to DANTE, i.e. October 
1992, to provide a 2Mb/s 
multiprotocol
64
 backbone dubbed EMPB/Europanet. Unfortunately, it is fair to state that neither 
IXI nor Europanet were really suitable for production, compared to, e.g. HEPNET, because of the 
chronic saturation of these early under-dimensioned pan-European backbones and the resulting 
high packet-loss rates. Another reason for sticking to private networks was also the glaring lack of 
trust in RARE and DANTE, because of their political and technical biases as well as their lack of 
transparency that is still lasting more than twenty years afterwards! 
Indeed, for many years, the problem was that both DANTE and the NRENs were 
systematically losing the race towards higher bandwidth, because of their inefficient bureaucratic 
as well as political approach to building networks (e.g. by systematically refusing presence at 
popular Internet Exchange Points), until GEANT [137] finally came up in 2001 with a 2.5Gb/s 
                                                 
63

COSINE member states.

first and then, finally
65
, a 10Gb/s backbone. The amusing “anecdote” is that, because of the lack 
of affordable 40Gb/s circuits that was however compensated by the availability of cheap 10Gb/s 
lightpaths over leased dark fibers
 
[138], GEANT was reluctantly “forced” to evolve from a 
“single” Global pan-European backbone into “multiple” Mission Oriented Networks, e.g. 
DEISA, JIVE, LHC, i.e. back where the scientific community was in the 1980s with HEPnet, 
MFEnet, NSI, which is, in my opinion, an excellent evolution, though not exactly what had been 
planned by DANTE and  Telecom Operators who thought that transmission technology would 
continue to evolve steadily towards higher speeds, i.e. 40Gb/s (OC-768/STM-256), 160Gb/s and 
eventually Tb/s, at affordable prices! 
Furthermore, they were neither willing to share power nor leave a role to anybody else than 
themselves; a “conflict of interest”, so to speak, but a ”chicken and egg” situation too, in the 
sense that the HEPnet community was not willing to merge its well suited and well working 
networking infrastructure into a shared network which, in the early 1990s, was, almost by 
definition, highly congested because of the non-availability of high speed circuits at affordable 
prices (i.e. one had to wait until 1997 to have TEN-34, a 34 Mb/s Pan-European backbone, 
operational). However, this was not completely the fault of DANTE, as before the  Telecom 
deregulation that took effect on January 1
st
 1998, the National PTTs were extremely reluctant to 
sell >2Mb/s circuits; worse again the cost of two 2Mb/s circuits was essentially twice the price of 
single 2Mb/s circuit, while, when the market was opened to competition and thanks to the 
economy of scales that could be achieved through the wide use of SDH’s 
 
G.702 hierarchy [139], 
it became common to upgrade the bandwidth by a factor four in bandwidth at a factor two or even 
less in cost. The original PTT price structure was not cost based, hence the numerous abuses 
observed in most countries. A positive effect of the Telecom deregulation was the emergence of 
new, so called, “TELCOs
66
” [140], however, a very negative effect was that, in order to gain 
market shares, they started to dump prices; in addition, too many operators and too many 
transoceanic cables, especially across the Atlantic, the introduction of DWDM
67
 [141] had a 
“devastating” effect that worsened the “bandwidth glut” thus greatly accelerating the demise of 
many new TELCOs, e.g. KPNQWest, TeleGlobe in the 2002-2003 period, also called the “Dot-
com” bubble
 
[142]. 
When the question of CERN’s connection to DANTE’s backbone came about, some HEPnet 
leaders, e.g. Enzo Valente, were violently against CERN having to pay for its own connection
68
, 
under the argument that the HEP institutes were already being charged by their NREN to connect, 
via DANTE, to CERN, a case of double charging so to speak. The whole argument made little 
sense actually; nonetheless, it was very difficult to convince the CERN management that they had 
no other option than to find the necessary budget, which they finally did. The issue was further 
complicated by the fact that connection to DANTE was a bundled offer including access to 
existing
 
European NRENs, as well as access to the commercial Internet that had become an 
absolute necessity in order to communicate with scientists worldwide and, in particular, with US 
scientists in the post-NSFNET period (i.e. April 1995-1997) that, apart from the vBNS
 
[143] 
(very high speed Backbone Network System) connected sites, were only accessible through the 
commercial Internet, until Internet2 finally came into being.  
Nonetheless, following the end of ECFA SG5, HEPnet started to structure itself, though not 
without very painful initial disputes, essentially because of leadership questions, in particular the 
role or non-role of CERN; indeed, as CERN did not participate in the funding of the HEPNET 
                                                 
65

lines but only to their operations, some HEPnet leaders thought that CERN had to keep the lowest 
possible profile.  
There is another interesting article presented at CHEP89 in March 1989 in Oxford by François 
Fluckiger titled: “Overview of HEP Wide Area Networking: Producer Perspective” [144] whose 
12 conclusions are extremely informative, but I will only quote three of them: 3) TCP/IP services 
will be in use everywhere within 18 months 4) OSI is late; it will work for several services. It 
deserves to remain a strategic direction 6) Protocol flavor disputes (e.g. ISO CONS versus ISO 
CNLS) are nonsense!   
HEPNET was also one of the pioneers in establishing leased lines to Eastern countries, i.e. 
two 9.6 Kb/s lines from CERN to the Particle Physics Institute of the Hungarian Academy of 
Sciences (KFKI) in Budapest (1989) and to the Institute of Physics in Cracow (Poland) (early 
1990). However, the CERN administration was almost paranoiac about the strict compliance to 
the CoCom rules (refer to chapter 6.1) that prevented remote login from Eastern European 
countries, despite their CERN membership, while electronic mail and file transfer were tolerated! 
So, the above two lines were isolated from CERN’s main internal network by a firewall (sic). 
This was actually a completely ridiculous situation as, although access to the Cray XMP 
supercomputer was severely restricted, even to CERN staff members, the same physicists who 
could not login to CERN from their home institute, could access in all legality most CERN 
computers when they were visiting CERN! Fortunately, this sad situation did not last long after 
the fall of the Berlin wall, late 1989. 
Although HEPnet had no formal (i.e. legal) existence, it could be considered as acting under 
the ECFA umbrella, having been created by ECFA SG5, therefore ECFA had observer status at 
the RARE CoA and at the EARN Board although it was rarely physically represented. 
Nonetheless, the HEPnet Technical Committee (HTC) and the HEPnet Requirements 
Committee (HRC) were created during the first half of 1989. The HTC was initially chaired by 
François Fluckiger and had several sub-committees:  DECNET, IP, SNA, Converters (i.e. GIFT, 
MINT 
 
[145] (Mail INTerchange)), X.25. 
4.1.1 HTC-SNA 
For the sake of completeness, it is worth mentioning that there were a small
69
 number of SNA 
islands in Europe during the 1980s and the early 1990s, much like the European Internet islands 
before 1989. Hence, the HTC-SNA activity that included links between CERN, CEA, RAL, 
CASPUR, ETH, in particular.  
In Germany, prior to the emergence of WIN, AGFnet, a native SNA network of the German 
National Research Centers and Universities was initially run by GMD Bonn, linking the main 
German research centers and universities (e.g., DESY
70
 [146], Jülich Research Centre [147], 
MPI
71
 [148]). AGFnet was subsequently merged into DFN’s WIN in the form of an SNA over 
X.25 sub-network.  
As explained in Peter Streibelt’s EASinet article “Those EASI sites that need connectivity for their 
mainframes running SNA (IBM's Systems Networking Architecture) are connected via the SNI technique. 
SNI (SNA Network Interconnection) allows to manage large SNA networks by splitting them into many 
small networks or to connect other autonomous networks. Within EASInet the 'back-to-back' technique of 
SNI has been implemented. With 'back-to-back' the participating SNA networks remain nearly autonomous. 
They only need to agree to a few definitions of a common 'Null-net' to which they are connected via one or 
more gateways. The gateway function is part of the SNA access methods on the IBM mainframes.

The SNI network of EASInet itself has gateways to other SNI networks within Europe e.g. EARN, HEPnet 
or AGFnet.”  
4.1.2 European HEPnet Consortium 
“The European HEPnet consortium 
 
[149] was formally established in December 1992 as part of 
the already existing HEP-CCC (HEP Computing Coordinating Committee), so combining within 
a single body the functions of each.  The HEP-CCC will revise its membership and its terms of 
reference as appropriate to take proper account of its wider role.  The Chairman of the HEP-
CCC is also the Chairman of the Consortium. In addition, a body known as the HEPnet 
Consortium Executive Board acts as the executive arm of the Consortium and reports through its 
Chairman to the HEP-CCC Consortium.  The Executive Board 
 
[150] has five members, namely, 
the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and Secretary, who are appointed by the Consortium for a two 
year period, and the conveners of ECFA’s HRC and HTC Committees, who are ex-officio 
members of the Board. 
 
There are no doubts that both HEPNET and EASInet played a major role in the creation of the 
European Internet and it would be a mistake to be silent about it! 
The HEP-CCC [151] Technical Advisory Sub-Committee, HTASC 
 
[152] [153], a new 
structure replacing both the HTC and the HRC, was created in 1995; at the same time all the 
subcommittees of the HTC disappeared, however new ones were created, e.g. security, windows 
2000. HEPNET actually “died” in 2001 or so, “miserere nobis”! 
Strangely enough, one of the main problems with HEPNET was the lack of common interests 
between the supporters, sometimes the “missionaries” even, of IBM, DEC, ISO/OSI, X.25, etc. 
Also, many of the HEPNET actors wore too many “hats” so, despite the fact that the physical 
network was not only real but also huge compared to the other international networks of those 
days, HEPNET was a very chaotic, though very necessary, undertaking! 
4.2 DECNET 
DECNET was then extremely popular within the LEP experiments that were making extensive 
use of DEC’s PDP then VAX computers. This trend was accelerated by the generalized 
introduction of Ethernet based LANs and the emergence of HEPnet where DECNET could be run 
either natively or above X.25. However, DECNET phase IV suffered from many addressing 
limitations due to the limited number of areas and hosts (i.e. 63 and 64,449 respectively), hence 
the urgent need for DECNET phase V; given the “hype” surrounding ISO/OSI, DEC decided to 
make DENET phase V OSI compliant, maybe for marketing reasons?  
The main new feature of DECNET Phase V that resulted from its near-compliance with ISO’s 
CLNP
 
 [154] protocol was the extension of the limited phase IV address space available from 16 
bits to up to 160 bits (i.e. 20 Octets). An interesting aspect of the new addressing scheme was that 
addresses were of variable format and length and could also include a 48 bit Ethernet address in 
the low order portion.  
The migration from DECNET phase IV to DECNET Phase V was actually extremely urgent as 
the limited number of DECNET areas
72
 was slowing down the deployment of the wide-area 
DECNET infrastructure which the high energy physics and space community were then heavily 
dependent upon. A sophisticated, dual-stack oriented, migration strategy was developed by DEC 
that made lot of sense in rather small networks with limited number of hosts and sites. However, 
                                                 
72
 Support for networks of up to 64,449 nodes (i.e. 63 areas of 1023 nodes) 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 24 
the DECNET phase V transition was brutally stopped by DEC itself for a mixture of technical, 
marketing but also political reasons.  
Native DECNET access to CERN from Italy and UK was stopped in early 1998. 
To conclude on DECNET, I cannot resist writing that if there were legitimate concerns about 
the widespread use of proprietary IBM protocols by some people, it is quite amusing that the 
same people had no similar bias against the extensive use of DECNET phase IV, a proprietary 
DEC protocol  
 
5 The Protocol War and the OSI Standards battle 
5.1 A Tribute to IBM and DEC 
For reasons unknown to me IBM always kept a very low-key profile about its role in the 
establishment of an operational European networking infrastructure One reason could be that the 
implemented solutions were not along the main IBM lines of those days, namely MVS, SNA, 
TSO, CICS/IMS (databases), whereas most EARN central switching nodes (one per country) 
were VM/CMS
73
 [155] based, in fact using the same technology as VNET
74
 
 
[156]  i.e. RSCS 
networking and NJE protocols, another reason may be that IBM, being well aware that EARN 
was perceived by the OSI activists as  counter-productive, did not want to appear as exacerbating 
further the already “heated” European networking atmosphere by bringing in unnecessary 
politics. 
Therefore, it is not well known that without IBM’s very significant seed funding in the 
framework of their EARN and EASInet initiatives, Europe would probably have lagged behind 
the USA for many years whereas it actually caught-up surprisingly rapidly: 
 
1. By funding75 EARN for 4 years starting at the end of 1983. Besides many 9.6 Kb/s intra-
European lines, modems and a few VM/CMS systems to act as country nodes, IBM also 
contributed two 9.6 Kb/s transatlantic lines in Roma and Bonn (GMD) initially and later 
one 64 Kb/s line in Montpellier (CNUSC), in order to provide the needed interconnection 
with BITNET. Last, but not least, IBM also contributed organizational support, both 
technical (Berthold Pasch) and managerial (Alain Auroux, Peter Streibelt). 
2. By providing a T1 link [157] between CERN (Geneva) and Cornell (USA), the newly 
born NSFNET T1 backbone, in fact, extending  NSFNET to Europe while, at the same 
time, establishing 2Mb/s lines between IBM supercomputer centers (EASInet initiative) 
3. By agreeing together with other partners, such as HEPnet, to integrate these into Ebone, 
thus greatly facilitating the establishment of the Ebone consortium and the creation of an 
embryonic pan-European Internet backbone. 
Likewise, the role of IBM in the early NSFNET T1 backbone NSS (Nodal Switching 
Subsystem), the 2
nd
 generation T3
76
, before Cisco took over when NSFNET moved to ATM,

st
 then 622 Mb/s in the form of 4*155Mb/s, as there was no 622Mb/s ATM interface 
available on the market, has been largely ignored! 
Herb Budd (IBM), though of American origin, played a decisive role in the History of 
European Networking, and was definitely playing for Europe. This opinion is also shared by Paul 
Bryant: “I think that Herb Budd was senior enough to get money without too many questions being asked 
and also he was not particularly interested in furthering IBM's interests.” One of Herb Budd’s favorite 
sentences was about “the vacuum of networking leadership in Europe” which was not liked, at 
all, by the RARE Council of Administration (CoA).  Actually, the problem was not so much the 
lack of leadership than the abundance of “would-be” leaders whose first priority was to take 
control of European research networks, no matter what! Of course there is no such thing as a 
“free lunch”, however, there was a clear “win-win” situation; therefore, it is not only strange but 
also disappointing that the decisive role of IBM in the foundation of European Networking, 
thanks to their seed-funding of EARN first and EASInet next, is not better recognized! The 
problem was that for the OSI activists EARN was diversionary and took resources from the final 
OSI solution. Paul Bryant’s view, which is fully in line with mine, is that “the OSI contingent 
finally started to realize they could not go on promising forever”. 
Last, the role of DEC with their EARN/OSI initiative should not be underestimated as without 
the DEC funding that brought additional bandwidth, parts of the EARN community would have 
had some difficulties in the 1989-1990 period. Paul Bryant recalls: “Certainly the DEC finance 
was extensive. I well remember when Odd Jorgensen
77
 marched in and had a brain storming 
session on how it was to be done, a rather embarrassing event. He decided to rip up my Perugia 
document and start from scratch. It succeeded because of the large resources put in. Remember 
the control centre in Amsterdam run by a guy from DEC Jerry Striplin, Nial O'Reilly and a 
couple of others. In my view the GBOX was the key to the project which not only gave us NJE 
over X25 but NJE over IP that allowed us to get rid of the short lived NT switches. I sent the RAL 
switch to Kees Neggers whose network used them.” 
5.2 The semantic discussion on “standards”  
The question of what was a “standard” and what was not a “standard” was then an extremely 
“hot” issue, National vs. International standards, European standards (e.g. ETSI) vs. International 
standards organizations like CCITT/ITU, ISO or self-proclaimed bodies such as the IETF. 
Whereas everybody understood the needs and advantages of standards, few countries were ready 
to abandon their national standards for international standards, e.g. electric plug formats is still an 
issue today. In other words, nationalism was still prevailing in the 1970s as exemplified by the 
PAL [158] SECAM [159] battle on broadcast Television systems standards [160] and the 
repeated failures to build a coherent European computer industry, as every partner was entangled 
in his own short-sighted interests. 
Without doubts, there is a hidden agenda behind any standard as the proposer(s) clearly intend 
to derive significant competitive advantage from its wider adoption. The above PAL/SECAM 
story is a representative example of this; likewise, ISO/OSI standards were pushed by the 
European Commission under the assumption that the European industry would reap significant 
benefits from their adoption by the networking community, at large, given their, supposedly, 
superior status of International standards over the ARPA, aka Internet or TCP/IP, protocols that 
did not qualify as such! However, there was one significant exception the CCITT/ITU standards 
that were widely used by Telephony and Telecom operators worldwide. Indeed as pointed out by 
Larry Roberts in chapter 19.2.5 “Unlike most standards activities, where there is almost no incentive to 
                                                 
77

compromise and agree, carriers in separate countries can only benefit from the adoption of a standard 
since it facilitates network interconnection and permits easier user attachment”. 
Unfortunately, ISO standardization did not follow the CCITT example and was a slow, four-
step process that depends on the voted approval of many committees.  The IETF, on the other 
hand, was much more freewheeling. A statement made in 1992 by Dave Clark has been its 
informal motto: “We reject kings, presidents and voting; we believe in rough consensus and running 
code”. Hence, this is no wonder that the IETF during its early years, could make progress much 
faster than other more “democratically” structured standards bodies such as ISO, thanks to the 
contributions of many worldwide networking experts and, in particular, those of INRIA
78
 and 
UCL
79
. 
 The issue of using International standards rather than proprietary solutions, such as IBM (SNA 
and RSCS) or DEC (DECNET) but also TCP/IP protocols was the object of “heated” 
discussions. For example, every time someone referred to the TCP/IP standards, James Hutton, 
then chairman of RARE, would, literally speaking, become “red” explaining in his usual “calm” 
manner, often starting with “For Christ’s sake”, that, unlike, CCITT, ETSI, ISO, ITU, etc., the 
IETF was not an International standards organization; in other words, IETF RFCs, although open, 
were similar to proprietary standards.  
However, this had not prevented the UK academic community from developing its own 
“interim
80
” standards the, so called, “Coloured Book
81
” which, as explained in the next chapter, 
were originally designed to run over X.25 networks, thus the cornerstone of the new protocol 
suite was the NITS
82
 transport layer also known as YBTS
83
.  
The UK “Coloured Book” never succeeded in reaching ISO standard status and was thus only 
used across JANET, the national academic network in the UK. During the course of their 
existence which was actually rather short
84
, the “Coloured Book” was a source of problems 
outside the UK in the area of electronic mail
85
 and file transfer
86
. However, the choice of not 
promoting the “colored book” outside the UK was quite deliberate, Paul Bryant recalls: “We were 
rather reluctant to export coloured book protocols, as we did not want to undermine OSI. We 
expected that there would be a lot of gateways between national and ISO networks that would be 
part of a long transition. Indeed we already had many of them, e.g. “Grey Book
87
” to EARN mail 
gateway at RAL, the EARN/OSI GBOX. I think most university sites had a gateway of some sort. 
Actually my team had “Blue Book” over X25 working in about mid-1980 and JANET “coloured 
book” ended around mid-1990 so it gave a service for 10 years – quite a long time.” 
As already mentioned in chapter 2.4, although the “Grey Book” was compatible with SMTP
 
[161] at the application level, it introduced unfortunate changes to the format of ARPA mail

 Christian Huitema, Christophe Diot, etc. 
79
 Mark Handley, Steve Kille, etc. 
80
 An innovative way to self-ascribe the standard status  
81
 It is not clear to me whether they ever reached the status of a British standard; however, they were submitted as a 
contribution to BSI’s DPS/20 working group, which was concerned with architecture and higher level protocols.

 1984-1997 where support for X.25 was stopped thus marking the end of the “Coloured Book”, however, an IP over 
X.25 service had been introduced in 1991 quickly followed by native IP links. By 1993, IP traffic already exceeded the 
X.25 traffic.

addresses, as specified in 1982
88
 by RFC 822 [162], by reversing the order of electronic mail 
addresses, i.e. user@uk.ucl.cs instead of user@cs.ucl.uk according to the reasoning that 
electronic mail should follow postal code and/or telephone numbers, but also to stay compatible 
with the naming conventions defined at the transport layer in the new UK protocol suite
89
, that 
was designed around the same time as new ARPA domain-based email addresses. In other words, 
the construction of UK names followed a “big-endian
90
” convention [163] regarding order of 
components.  
As explained in C. Cooper’s JANET History “Original JANET Protocols
91
”:“Although it was 
known that ARPANET and UUCP/Usenet were adopting the opposite, ‘little-endian’ convention, this was 
not then regarded as sufficiently significant to cause the UK to change, since ARPANET (and UUCP) 
protocols had no particular standing at the time in a standards context. Moreover, to have mail service 
names use the opposite convention to transport service names seemed both confusing and inconsistent. As 
we shall see, the consequences of this apparently innocuous, but ultimately contentious, decision were to 
haunt JANET for nearly 15 years!” 
Indeed, the different addressing styles caused a number of interesting problems as according to 
the above example “.cs” (computer science) also happened to be the country code of 
Czechoslovakia before the split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, therefore, it was not 
always possible to know whether an address was a “Coloured Book” one or an ARPA one! 
It is also funny to observe that the UK academic community, which was pushing as hard as it 
could towards the use of ISO standards, refused to use the two characters ISO country code [164] 
of their own country, namely “.gb
92
”, for their email addresses and preferred to continue using 
“.uk” along the well-known principle “Do as I say not as I do”   
As pointed out by Dennis Jennings the matter was not as straightforward: “To be fair, the country 
is actually called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland – not Great Britain – and 
“uk” is correct and the ISO standard “gb” is incorrect for that country.  Car registrations however, do use 
GB”. For more information on this amazing “controversy” refer to C. Cooper’s JANET History 
“Naming, the last word
93
”.  
In any case, the Americans did even worse in a similar situation by assuming that, as the whole 
world was being led by them, there was no need for an “.us” suffix in their electronic mail 
addresses, but who could have guessed then that ARPA style addresses would become so widely 
used? This type of common behavior can be qualified as “the creator syndrome”. Indeed, as 
noted by Paul Bryant: “the UK invented postage stamps and so they are unique in not having the 
name of the country on their stamps.” 
Another interesting discussion was about the use of car plates vs. ISO country codes and I am 
not aware that other “champions” of ISO standards such as Germany, for example, have any 
plans to change their car plates from “D” to “DE”, whereas, strangely enough, the United 
Kingdom is one of the few countries that follows the ISO country codes with GB on their car 
plates  
                                                 
88
 There has been numerous RFCs (i.e. 196, 561, 680, 724, 733), dealing with Mail, however, as strange as it may look, 
the concept of domain named electronic mail addresses was only formally introduced in 1982. Prior to RFC822 the 
notation was ‘name at mailbox’. 
89

 The term Great Britain was first used officially in 1474, although it dates back to 1136 and refers to the island of 
Great Britain as Britannia major ("Greater Britain"), to distinguish it from Britannia minor ("Lesser Britain"), the 
continental region which approximates to modern Brittany (France).

In terms of layers, X.25 consisted of several, of which the uppermost was the network layer. 
The CCITT/ITU-T versions of the protocol specifications are for Public Data Networks (PDN). 
The ISO/IEC versions address additional features for private networks (e.g. Local Area Networks 
(LAN) use) while maintaining compatibility with the CCITT/ITU-T specifications. 
The user facilities and other features supported by each version of X.25 and ISO/IEC 8208 
have varied from edition to edition. Surprisingly, there were six major protocol versions of 
CCITT/ITU-T X.25 recommendation named as follows: 1) Orange Book (1976), 2) Yellow Book 
(1980), 3) Red Book (1984), 4) Blue Book (1988), 5) White Book (1993), 6) Grey Book (1996)! 
Needless to say, the related migration issues were far more difficult to handle than incremental 
changes like Windows software update for example. 
5.3 The UK “Coloured Book” epic 
Regarding the UK “Coloured Book”, it is quite humorous to observe that the first thing that the 
“promoters of standards” do is to publish their own, be they interim, standards, in order to 
address the shortage or the shortcomings of existing standards. However, in so doing they could 
not ignore that it was bound to create additional problems by increasing the “entropy” of the 
already overly complex networking “standards” universe.    
Nonetheless, the very bold and innovative approach taken by the UK academic community 
back in 1973 with the first Wells report that proposed to establish a national academic research 
network using interim UK developed standards to be deployed over the, yet to come, pre-X.25 
based EPSS
94
 network [165] of the GPO
95
 [166] deserves to be underlined. Although this first 
report was not very well received as it had taken for granted the need for a national network and 
therefore concentrated on how to build it rather than why it was needed, it finally led after a 
second round to the establishment of the JNT
96
 at the end of 1979 and the inauguration of JANET 
in 1984. Indeed, the original ambitious planning was delayed for many reasons, e.g., EPSS
97
 was 
only started in April 1977 instead of 1975 and after a successful trial was replaced by BT’s
98
 
commercial X.25 PSS99 service in August 1981
100
 [167] whereas JANET was finally launched in 
1984, i.e. more than 10 years after the visionary Wells report. However, it interesting to note that 
BT’s international X.25 network service IPSS
101
 was launched in 1978 i.e. well before PSS went 
into operation due to the high demand for affordable access to US based database and other 
network services. Nonetheless as rightly pointed out by Paul Bryant “The PTTs were very pedestrian 
particularly in the pre deregulation days. They believed firmly that voice was and would be the 
predominant use of their network with data a minor amount riding over it. At the time of EPSS we were told 
that although an interesting experiment they did not expect it to last. Fast switching (now known as ISDN) 
would take over and that would be more than sufficient to meet any needs we had with its generous 2x64K. 
This view continued for a long time and to some extent explains the PTT or at least BT
102
 attitude to data 
and their love of the telephone exchange.”

 Editor’s note : all European PTTs more or less adopted the same attitude 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 29 
This very intricate but fascinating piece of the European Research Networking history is 
remarkably described by Christopher S. Cooper in his book “JANET: The First 25 Years” [172] 
prefaced by P. Kirstein. I found the following two excerpts of particular relevance to this article.  
1. Basing a UK service network on ARPANET would have left the UK103 network without control over its 
own technology – and, indeed, it was already known that there were likely to be changes in the ARPANET 
protocols. Moreover, expertise in development and operation of its network would be a continuing 
requirement for the UK community but, with development of ARPANET technology centered in the USA 
– in spite of the contributions of Peter Kirstein’s group at UCL – it was very likely there would be 
continual leakage of the best UK expertise to the US. This was no idle speculation: the scientific ‘brain-
drain104’ [173] to the USA was something which the UK had by then been experiencing for two decades 
owing to post-war lack of finance to match USA facilities. The Working Party recommended that a priority 
should be the adoption of community-wide standard protocols: indeed, national or international standards 
if possible. 
2. In April 1984, the Joint Academic Network (JANET) came into service. It was indeed the first such 
network which connected the facilities both of the main academic computers, and those needed for 
specific research. This network required close collaboration also with BT, so it necessarily used the X.25 
protocol at the network level. In fact the British had developed a complete set of protocols covering 
terminal traffic, transport, LANs, mail, name serving and file transfer. Some, in particular the network 
level105, was part of international standards; the rest were specific to the UK. The UK had also started 
having experience with US network, from the gateway to UCL which had already been providing 
operational traffic for over 10 years. In addition, JANET provided gateways to the commercial BT packet 
services and to EUNET. 
  
As reported by Paul Bryant, other important network developments happened in parallel with 
the Wells reports as, as early as 1974: “SRC wanted to connect its three sites together to share their 
resources and they decided to take advantage of EPSS
106
. It was a few people interested in networks such 
as myself at the Atlas Laboratory, Peter Girard [168] at RAL and Tony Petefield at Daresbury. I think we 
really did it because it looked interesting and we saw we could do a bit better than directly connected 
terminals and card reader line printer sets. We used EPSS because it was given to us - for no better reason. 
We did not know a lot about what was going on in the USA but knew enough to know that ARPANET’s 
IMPs were very expensive and we had little confidence that the technology would survive. Having got it 
going X25 came along and it was an obvious and easy step to convert to X25 albeit using BSC (remember 
HDLC chips were rare and built interfaces even rarer). By the time JNT came along we could demonstrate 
X25 and triple X and a bit more and we firmly believed that BT would provide us with the network 
infrastructure and we could do away with leased lines and experimental work. If we had gone for ARPA 
then we would not have expected to be able to use a public service. In retrospect the flaws in that argument 
are clear but not at the time. Although we were fairly proud of what we are doing I don't think it was 
national pride or anti USA that drove us, it was a belief that we were doing the right thing. It was later that 
that translated to religious dogma.”  
 
There is a very informative article by Paul Bryant titled “The rise and rise of SRCnet” [169] 
that explains its key role played: “Without SRCnet, I think that the UK would have been in no 
better position than the other NRENs”.  
 
Although UK is the natural partner of the USA in Europe, they cannot stand the de facto 
master/slave relationship. Vis-à-vis Europe, UK is one among many other countries and their 
ancestral rivalry with French is still lasting, therefore everything proposed by France is suspect of 
“pulling the covers to oneself”, hence their dislike of EIN
107
, that was (too) strongly influenced by 
                                                 
103

 Editor’s note: It is exactly for that same reason that CERN was established in 1954

106
 In practice, EPSS having been delayed, SRCNET started with leased 2.4 Kb/s circuits 
107
 Despite that fact that it was led by Derek Barber (NPL) 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 30 
the CYCLADES work, as UK understandably “does not want to be fooled”; however, this 
attitude, that was unfortunately shared by several other large European countries
108
, was self-
destructive and actually led to the situation Europe is now in, i.e. excessive dependence over US 
technology. However, Paul Bryant is very right in his observation that “We must also remember 
European industry did have the opportunity to build equipment for IP had it wanted to. Why are there no 
European routers
109
? Perhaps some of that EU money should have gone in that direction rather than on a 
range of ill-conceived expedition. In the UK we did start a network industry - the CAMTEC PADs and 
switches [170], Cambridge Ring. But when IP came about we just rolled over and bought Cisco and then 
Juniper etc.” The final issue of the Engineering Computing Newsletter dated March 1996 that 
deals, among other things, with the death of British computing industry is also of very high 
technical as well as historical relevance [171].  
Finally, since there were too many contenders to a single winner, the easiest solution was to 
have only losers, an organized scuttling in a way!  
Here are some relevant comments from Paul Bryant about my comments on the insular 
behavior of the English people: “The British do have a significant European problem - very few speak 
anything but English (that is changing but the new languages emanate from the Indian sub-continent). This 
makes picking up ideas and technology from Europe as opposed to the USA difficult. We were aware of 
EIN but not of the detail and it were relegated to a possibly interesting experiment, certainly not anything 
on which one could build a network. I think the dislike of France was at the political rather than the 
personal level.” 
As already mentioned NITS was the cornerstone of the “Coloured Book” protocols and 
quoting C. Cooper again: “although it was designed with X.25 in mind, it also included descriptions of 
how to realise it over a variety of underlying networks such as leased lines, (PSTN
110
), X.21 circuit 
switched networks. The other significant extension to the collection of YBTS specifications appeared in 
1981/2, as campus networking was being developed; this specification, together with other parts of the 
Cambridge Ring specifications were reworked into what became known as CR82 (Cambridge Ring 1982), 
the Orange Book, which was in a form suitable for submission to standards bodies. Subsequently, in 1983 a 
procedure was published which defined how YBTS could be realised over asynchronous lines, a simpler 
option than synchronous lines (as used by PTTs), with or without X.25, and suitable for use with 
microprocessor based systems by then in widespread use.” 
Unfortunately, excessive/blind dependence on X.25 had undesirable effects, e.g. moving 
functions normally held below the network layer up to the transport
111
 layer but even worse: There 
was one awkward point about this otherwise apparently complete solution to handling interactive 
terminals: what if the underlying network
112
 did not use X.25, and in consequence X.29 [174] was 
unavailable? And the community had already developed the Yellow Book Transport Service to enable 
networks of diverse technology to be interconnected so as to allow high-level protocols to operate end-to-
end over the concatenated set of networks. The approach taken to this problem was to define a terminal 
protocol which had all the same features as X.29 but which operated over YBTS: this was known as TS29. 
By design it could operate over a concatenation of networks supporting YBTS. Since the features and 
capabilities of TS29 and X.29 were the same, an exact mapping between the two was possible. 
Postulating X.25 at the network layer led to a number of complications that are very well 
explained by C. Cooper below, showing that the application layer cannot be completely agnostic 
about the intricacies of the network layer with respect to charging, in particular.

 France in the first place but also Germany 
109
 Editor’s note: a possible explanation is that in the PTT monopoly regime, connection-oriented services were much 
more lucrative than flat-charged packet-oriented services like the emerging Internet, furthermore, the PTTs as well as 
the healthy European X.25 industry wanted to continue to reap the commercial benefits of their technology. Their lack 
of foresight was largely due to the fact that they lived in a closed world and were blind to the long announced 
emergence of the Telecom deregulation in 1998.

 Public Switched Telephone Network

 However, the transport layer is the natural place to interconnect networks with different technologies. 
112
 Editor’s note: Typically the campus LAN 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 31 
“The significance of transport service (TS) in the UK protocols was now becoming clearer. It was not just 
that transport was the layer at which network independence, that is, independence from low-level 
technology such as LAN or WAN, could be achieved: that same independence also meant that it could be 
used as the layer at which to interconnect networks. By implementing TS on each network technology, it 
could be used as the common layer above which any application protocol could operate end-to-end.” 
C. Cooper then goes on with the following realistic comment on the Cambridge Ring 
development (Sec2:90 page 108): “However, experimental development is one thing: a supported 
service product quite another”.  This is confirmed by Paul Bryant: “The Cambridge ring was a sad 
story. The first implementations were via a box interfacing to the ring on one side and (I think) a 
synchronous interface on the other. And there it stuck. There were a number of attempts to build the ring 
chip but they all failed. I think it was something to do with jitter. Without the chip, ring interfaces were 
never likely to be very popular. It was also designed at a time when memory/electronics etc., was expensive 
so you tried to make the protocol simple so making the hardware simple. However, both the ring and 
Ethernet were wrong in expecting shared media to work well when you have users able to clobber the 
system at the pull of a plug.” 
But continuing on the Cambridge Ring story (Sec2:90 page 108): “This picture of early LAN 
technology exploitation is typical of what happens in the early adoption phase of a technology. Most of the 
basic research for LANs had been accomplished in the mid-1970s; but bringing the technology to market, 
with the accompanying standardisation, software development and overall product support, together with 
the eventual market shake-out which has to occur before market and product stability are achieved, took 
about a decade. In this case there were several other factors. The PC and the single-user workstation both 
appeared in the same timeframe. The PC was an almost immediate success in the office; however, disk 
storage and printers were expensive. For sharing information and expensive peripherals in this context, the 
Ethernet began to proliferate quite rapidly”.  
Editor’s note: Whereas early adoption of new technologies may turn out to be an advantage, it 
may also turn out to be an expensive undertaking, examples of this flourish in the fast moving 
LAN area, e.g. CERN with Apollo domain, Ultranet, FDDI, IBM Token Ring, UK, with the 
Cambridge Ring.  On the contrary lagging behind can turn out to be an advantage as it may avoid 
adoption of intermediate technologies and therefore save costs. Similar behavior has been 
observed in the telephony world where investments are huge on a national scale and where 
countries that were leading in terms of analog telephone coverage (e.g. Germany) started lagging 
behind countries that were way behind in terms of their analog telephone network coverage and 
jumped directly to digital telephone networks (e.g. France with ISDN). On the other hand, as 
evidenced by the sad ISO/OSI story, while you are waiting for the "right" technology the user 
does not have a service! 
C. Cooper then points out an artifact of running your own protocols on a commercial network 
(sec2:44 page 62): “Like all protocols, issues arose after YBTS had been defined, either as a result of 
experience or because of later external events, and these led to revisions. We mention just one here, partly 
because it had financial implications and partly because exactly the same issue reappeared a decade later 
in the more international context of broadband ISDN. As EPSS evolved into the commercial service PSS, so 
it was revealed how BT would charge for the service. Communication service charges can typically involve 
a number of elements: a per-call element, distance, duration, line speed and volume of traffic, for example. 
The charge for a fixed line telephone call has traditionally depended on the first three. For PSS, BT tariffs, 
like those for ordinary telephone calls, included a per-call charge. For the common case of a computer 
with a number of users making use of the same remote service, such as a regional or national service, it 
would be common for a number of simultaneous calls to be in use between the two. If the transport service 
had the ability to support (multiplex) a number of transport connections over a single X.25 call then the per 
call element could be reduced to one for any given destination. This extension was added but, although 
significant, it is not clear how much it was eventually deployed because, as it would turn out, neither PSS 
nor any other commercial network would after all form the basis of the academic network.”

Amazing as it may look the “Coloured Book” were behaving very well with respect to both 
stability and performance, as evidenced by Paul Bryant: “As one who implemented coloured book 
protocols then I can say unequivocally they did work and were stable. True they were not commercial 
products or not wholly. Remember I had a network of an IBM, 20 or so GEC [176] and 20 or so PR1ME 
[177] computers which all exhibited X25, triple X, Blue Book and Grey book. The only commercial product 
was the X25 and triple X from PR1ME (one USA manufacturer that had a measure of faith in the ISO 
world). I am not so conversant with what was happening at other sites. Performance was largely restricted 
by the pitiful line speeds of 9.6K. I remember talking to Peter Linington on a long train journey about 
whether X25 would scale with speed. Some performance could be got from link by link rather than end to 
end acknowledgements. However, Peter's view was that you could get the speed by putting more of the 
protocol into hardware.” 
To be fair the heroic work then made by UK scientists, as well as the historical role of the 
SERC/JNT team, must be applauded, unfortunately, as noted by P. Kirstein in his preface it is 
clear that these endeavors did not significantly benefit the UK industry: “Successful commercial 
companies frequently emerge from academic activities and the networking field is no exception. The US-
sponsored Internet IP family eventually won out internationally and this book shows how JANET was able 
to make the transition to IP without interrupting services to the research and education community. The 
transition took until 1993 to complete and was no mean task, with the result that there were few UK 
commercial spin-offs arising out of the JANET development activities”. 
Last, the migration to TCP/IP was not easy to swallow, quoting Paul Bryant again: “What 
happened was that we planned to use old DEC machines as routers and to do it all for nothing but before 
that plan came to fruition JNT decided to provide CISCO routers. The Shoestring name was my invention. 
At that time there was a television program about a fictional detective called Shoestring set in Bristol (near 
where I come from) and it just seemed to be an appropriate name. Bob Day who eventually moved from 
RAL to JNT was a prime mover in persuading JNT that it would be better for them to take an active interest 
in the project and thus get control over it and to fund it. It was a better solution than using DEC 
machines.” 
5.4 The ISO/OSI protocols  
The ISO/OSI vs. Internet protocols controversy, i.e. International Standards against the “rough 
consensus” driven, mostly US led, IETF, showed the dangers of a technocratic and doctrinarian 
approach to urgent problems requiring, well working, operationally validated, solutions. 
Although the ISO/OSI reference model [178] and its associated protocol suite had lot of 
appeals, they were far too immature at the time where they started to be highly praised and 
actively promoted. In other words, they were very far from having reached the required level of 
stability and usability, in addition there was far too much politics behind them to make them 
credible at all, despite the fact that availability of OSI protocols according to the relevant

 profile, was then a mandatory requirements of public procurement procedures in many 
countries, including the USA, as has also been the case for IPv6 for many years with the amazing 
success that everyone knows!  
RFC 1169 [179] “Explaining the Role of GOSIP” by V. Cerf (IAB
120
) and K. Mills (NIST
121
) 
issued in August 1990 is extremely informative and illustrates well the embarrassment of the 
Internet community, in general, but more specifically the Federal agencies (e.g. DoE, NASA) that 
would be obliged to comply with FIPS
122
 146, the US GOSIP, issued by NIST [180]. US GOSIP 
protocols were mandatory for US Federal Government purchases from 1990 until 1995. 
Indeed, mandating the availability of particular protocols is not the same as forcing their use, 
in other words it did not serve any useful purposes in practice. The only non-negligible remains 
of OSI are actually LDAP
123
 
 
[181] developed by the ISODE [182] consortium that met wide 
acceptance almost immediately and was standardized by the IETF. 
A very “intriguing” aspect of the OSI protocols, whose number one purpose was to strengthen 
the European industry, is that their complexity was such that only American companies, such as 
IBM and DEC, really managed to implement them! However, despite the public procurement 
rules that mandated their availability, the potential market was essentially non-existent. In 
addition, not being distributed as an integral part of the operating system they were, in practice, 
very difficult to install and even more difficult to use.  
One reason behind the complexity of many international standards is that they are often the 
results of compromises
124
; therefore they include many options but, for cost reasons, only few of 
them are implemented, therefore, in the absence of options negotiation procedures, there is no 
guarantee of interoperability between two implementations of the same standard, hence the need 
for “profiles” as already mentioned above regarding the need for a common “Triple X” dialect 
within HEPnet.  
Another insider comment from Paul Bryant: “I got involved with functional standards. In fact I did 
the triple X pair although I doubt whether anyone had read it since its publication. The work was just as 
slow as the development of the base standards in the first place. This was an incredible waste of time - even 
more so as the meetings were in Brussels. I wonder whether anyone has estimated the cost of defining the 
ISO protocols. Having implemented protocols, the biggest problem is the interface with the rest of the 
system i.e. the basic underlying mechanism. The options are the easier part and I could never understand 
why crippled implementations were ever written. In the case of triple X on the PRIME computer they fixed 
all the parameters making it useless for talking to my GECs. It took only a couple of hours to implement the 
full parameter negotiation.” 
X.25, which can be considered as a successful ITU/CCITT standard, had, for example, two 
operating modes: “virtual circuit” and “datagram”. To the best of my knowledge, nobody ever 
used the “datagram” variant. X.25, a reliable packet oriented protocol operating on “virtual 
circuits”, was implemented on top of circuit based or packet based networks, and had many 
similarities with ATM and, to some extent, MPLS even!  
X.400 
 
[183] was an electronic mail protocol with a rich set of options, which SMTP 
 
[184] 
the, then ASCII restricted, Internet mail protocol did not possess, as MIME 
 
[185] had not yet 
been specified. However, instead of selecting an ambitious X.400 profile that would have made 
the use of X.400 potentially much more attractive than that of SMTP, the profile selected by 
                                                 
119
 Government OSI Profile, the standards in the GOSIPs were generally ISO OSI ones; however, they also included 
X.25 and X.400.

RARE for their Message Handling System (MHS) project was actually as basic, functionality-
wise, as SMTP! 
In short, the whole debate was spoiled by too many political considerations but also by some 
insincerity.  
That said, I am as much in favor of international standards as anyone else, as long as they have 
the following properties: 1) adequate functionality 2) technical readiness 3) wide adoption 4) 
operational resilience 5) good integration and support by the supplier. Unfortunately, the ISO/OSI 
protocol suite never met any of these essential pre-conditions, hence their predictable fiasco and 
the resulting waste time and money! In addition, the use of standards, although highly desirable in 
principle, is by no means a lasting guarantee of success, e.g. X.21
125
 [186], IBM’s Token Ring
126
, 
FDDI, SMDS
127
 and early Ethernet products are all completely obsolete by now. 
 
Therefore, I am pretty worried by the speed at which “cloud computing” is “spreading” 
throughout the world, and especially in the U.S., without a satisfactory level of  common 
standards, e.g. “inter-cloud” and far too many parallel standardization efforts
 
 [187] proving that 
many people share similar worries about this new technology.  According to Michel Riguidel 
(Telecom Paris) “Cloud computing is seen by some people as the “Anti-Internet”, in other words 
the return of proprietary applications which is rightly seen as the negation of openness and 
interoperability!” [188] 
Along the same line of thought, Neil Sutton, vice president of BT Global Services, stated in 
June 2010 that “IT decision makers were suffering from cloud fatigue 
 
[189]”. Indeed, following 
the Metacomputing
 
[190], Grid then Cluster computing “hypes”, the history seems to be repeating 
itself, what will come next, an implosion of the “cloud” bubble is not impossible given the 
number of new entrants? There is only one certainty, the client server model will continue to 
prosper with more and more functionality added to the user handset, be it a  Smartphone, a 
Tablet, a Notebook or a even a standard PC through more and more functionality-rich Web 
browsers. 
5.5 The Protocol and other wars 
Given the prominent role played by the late Klaus Ullmann [191] in European Research 
networking it is impossible to ignore his key role in the establishment of RARE, DFN and 
DANTE and in the promotion of CCITT and ISO/OSI standards based networks. Likewise, given 
that the supporters of the RARE and EARN camps had fundamental disagreements
128
, on the 
technical and organizational options promoted by Klaus Ullmann as Director General of DFN
129
 
[192] and Chairman of the Board of DANTE [193], it would be double-tongued  to hide some 
facts that are even related by Klaus Ullmann himself in DANTE’s “A History of International 
Research Networking” book [194].

Indeed, despite the respect due to the memory  of Klaus Ullmann one remains flabbergasted by 
his definition of “Radicals
130
 and Conservatives
131
 on pages 133-134 of the above book, namely 
that the “radicals believe in opportunism, making use of whatever short term means are available 
for promoting their cause… For the radicals, personal glory is there to be won, at least among 
one’s peer group” whereas “the conservatives are more concerned with long-term stability and 
making careful preparations to minimize the number of problems. The people concerned may be 
ambitious but, in most cases, get satisfaction from working as members of a team with defined 
position in a hierarchy.”!  
The above definition is actually an amazing dialectical inversion of the reality as, with respect 
to European networking, the radicals pushed for proven solutions whereas the conservatives 
pushed for non-existent solutions that were only good on paper and, not surprisingly, turned out 
to be complete disasters. Indeed, implying that the choice of TCP/IP protocols was “risky” 
whereas the choice of OSI protocols was “riskless” is a rather surprising assertion to make in 
2010
132
, as one could not then ignore that the really “radical” choice, back in the 1980s, was to 
push the unproven OSI protocols “beyond reason”!  
Despite the repeated claims made by the “conservatives” [195] that they “avoided the protocol 
wars”, in other words that the protocol war was never “real” and therefore that “there was never 
a cease-fire”, there was a genuine “protocol war” in Europe, basically Internet protocols
133
 
against ISO/OSI protocols, back in the mid-1980s.  
Like is often the case in real wars, e.g. the Crusades back in the 11
th
 century, ideology is often 
used as a pretext to seize power, and it is therefore interesting to note that despite the amazing 
lack of vision shown by the “conservatives” in a fast evolving networking technology field that 
made them lose the technological battle, they undoubtedly won the power battle and that a few of 
them still hold key roles!  
As this article is about history, it may be appropriate to remind the readers that Jerusalem was 
taken by the Christians in 1099 then taken back by Saladin in 1187, hence the 3
rd
 crusade led by 
Richard I, King of England, also known as “Richard the Lionheart
134
”. “On May 24, 1192, all the 
Crusaders regroup in Ascalon and persuade Richard to lead the army of Jerusalem, while the latter is 
considering returning to Europe. The troupe left Ascalon June 7 and arrives shortly after to Qalandiya 
near Jerusalem. Richard set up his camp but hesitates to attack Jerusalem, leaving the Ayyubid [196] army 
time to regroup. Finally, Richard decides to retreat, to the annoyance of the Crusaders who will learn later 
that disagreement between Kurdish and Turkish troops led the garrison of Jerusalem on the verge of 
mutiny, and that the capture of the city would have been easy!” 
This story led Paul Bryant to wonder “what would have happened if the OSI brigade had 
continued with their battle - could they have made it all work? We will never know but I guess we 
have a good idea!” Another way of saying that history does not repeat itself.

5.5.1 What was the protocol war about? 
The solution on this side of the Atlantic, but also in Japan, was to use new emerging 
international ISO and CCITT/ITU standards (i.e. X.25, X.400, X.500, etc.) and to build new 
emerging NRENs according to the layered ISO/OSI model. 
There were many competing organizations and projects, those, e.g. EARN, EUnet, HEP/SPAN 
that were providing services (email, news, file transfer) to the scientific community, and others 
e.g. RARE, COSINE that were mostly doing paper work and politics (i.e. blocking in a very 
effective manner all initiatives and services that were not in line with their dogmatic views). The 
RARE community, being more academic than the “radicals”, self-declared themselves of higher 
intellectual level and was running closed Networkshop by invitation only! DANTE was not yet 
born. 
Whereas everyone knows that a number of projects and/or organizations had been in frontal 
competition during the pre-Internet era, i.e. mid-1980s, fewer people know that these ideological 
controversies made their way into some organizations. For example, David Lord and I were not 
highly regarded at CERN because of our involvement in EARN, the choice of the IBM token ring 
and Internet protocols for the LEP accelerator control network thus necessitating the deployment 
of a gateway with the main, Ethernet based, CERN LAN
135
 with all possible kinds of proprietary 
protocols running across it, e.g., AppleTalk [197], DECnet, IPX.  These internal criticisms were 
not very fair given that CERN greatly benefited from a significant IBM technology transfer, 
basically the same PC based technology developed by Yakov Rekhter’s [198] team at IBM’s 
Research Laboratory in Yorktown Heights for deployment across NSFNET’s Nodal Subsystem 
Nodes (NSS); in practice standard PCs, each driving a T1 line, interconnected by a token ring. 
The situation of David Lord and I was by no means not unique, Paul Bryant was in a situation 
at least as difficult at RAL, framed by his OSI “friends" James Hutton and Bob Cooper (JNT). 
CERN’s policy then was ISO/OSI, X.25, DECNET and Ethernet. While Ethernet has proven to 
be the right choice
136
, DECNET, and all other proprietary protocols, were not. However, 
DECNET, because of the widespread use of VAXes by HEP physicists worldwide but also the 
fact that DEC, unlike IBM, was perceived as a “good” company, because of their “long-held” 
promise that DECNET phase V, that in practice was never fully deployed, would be fully OSI 
CLNP compatible, was the “pet” manufacturer of CERN. 
5.5.2 How was the protocol war settled? 
It is only during the course of 1988 that CERN, under the impulsion of François Fluckiger and 
Brian Carpenter, moved away from the OSI strategy and became very pragmatic. Indeed, it is the 
establishment of RIPE in mid-1989 that marked without any doubts the start of the European 
Internet era in which CERN, together with EARN, EASInet, EUnet and HEPnet, played a 
significant role in contributing to establish the pan-European infrastructure as well as its 
extension to NSFnet, but also by being at the origin of the Web in 1992. 
The glaring lack of European leadership, actually the lack of a common and coherent European 
networking vision, was compensated by EASInet, a very significant computing and networking 
initiative from IBM that gave Europe additional time to get organized, in effect, extending 
NSFNET to Europe. Indeed, the T1 connection to NSFNET between CERN and Cornell 
University that became operational in February 1990 created a kind of earthquake within the 
                                                 
135
 Local Area Network 
136
 This was far from being obvious back in 1988 because of the distance limitations of Ethernet and uncertainties 
regarding the CSMA/CD access protocol with respect to fair access to the shared media  
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 37 
academic and research community as the move towards the wider adoption of Internet in Europe 
then became irresistible thus forcing the dissident NRENs to reluctantly wake-up to reality, which 
had three main results: 
1. The protocol war was officially closed during the 1st joint EARN/RARE conference 
that took place in Killarney (Ireland) in June 1990 and it was agreed to start 
coordinating the Internet engineering activities of all the stakeholders on a global scale. 
2. The IEPG137
 
[199] was thus formed there and the founding meeting was held shortly 
afterwards, next to the 18
th
 IETF meeting in August 1990 in Vancouver. 
3. Following the establishment of RIPE and the emergence of an embryonic IP 
backbone
138
 the fate of RARE was also “settled” which led to the merging of EARN 
and RARE into TERENA and probably also accelerated the creation of DANTE. 
 
The emergence of RIPE was far from getting universal support when first set up. Indeed, until 
the Web came up in 1992, there were still many who fought on with OSI. Paul Bryant mentions 
that “there was quite a rift in UKERNA and he does not recall James Hutton rushing over to RIPE 
meetings or at least the ones he went to.” Paul does not hesitate to even speak of a “Takeover of EARN 
by RIPE!!” and regarding the Open 
System vs. Proprietary battle, his view 
is that “it will never be won. In fact we 
need new ideas/products to make progress 
- some will succeed some will fail but that 
is better than stagnation. In addition, he 
also feels most/all technologies eventually 
become obsolete. Some, like FTAM, 
become obsolete before ever transferring a 
file in anger.” 
However, the battle for power between 
the “conservatives” and the “radicals” 
still goes on, more than 20 years after 
Killarney! In addition,  it is rather 
ironic that these are the same 
politicians who, along with many 
others, worked very efficiently 
towards the deregulation of the 
European Telecom market
139
, who have meticulously built new monopolies in Europe, namely 
DANTE/GEANT and NRENs, according to the principle that, as far as the academic and research 
community is concerned, a single pan-European backbone as well as single national networks 
were better than several competing ones, which is a bit weird in my opinion and, at the very least, 
questionable!  
 
As rightly pointed out by Dennis Jennings there were other “wars”:

 The “backbone” was going from Stockholm to Bologna through Amsterdam and Geneva and was connected at T1 
speed with NSFnet.

 The EC directive 98/10/EC also called the “Green Paper” on “Open Network Provision” became effective in 1998 
and was initially very beneficial but was then at the origin of the Telecom debacle in 2000 because of the bandwidth 
“glut” that followed the parallel construction of too many networks.

1. “The war between those who promoted the PTT public switched low speed volume tariffed 
network model and those who believed that the private leased line network model was 
appropriate for the research community, 
2. The war between those that supported the PTT monopoly and those that supported 
telecommunication liberalisation. 
Both of which were confused with the protocol “wars”.  Many people could not separate out these 
issues, and one of the major culprits here was the EEC who blindly supported the PPTs, public switched 
X.25 networks
140
, volume tariffs and ISO/OSI protocols (and later ATM – a technology fundamentally 
flawed from conception in that it ignored packet queuing!)”. 
Part of the problem arose because of fundamentally different conceptions of networking for research:   
1. The PTT model was of “telematics” – basically low speed terminal access to database services, 
and to centralised PTT provided services (the PTT “intelligent” networks).  In this model, PTT 
provided low speed X.25 packet switched volume charged networks were seen to provide more 
than adequate performance (as were even lower speed X.75 interchanges for international traffic), 
while preserving the PTT monopoly.  
2. For many in the research community the model was of pre-paid networking capacity for the 
transfer of volume data between computers.  Research institutions needed pre-paid capacity 
because they had no models for dealing with volume based charging, and they had always used 
leased lines for interconnecting their own campuses.  It was a natural step to using leased lines to 
interconnect universities nationally (as JANET did in the UK), and internationally (as EARN (IBM 
supported) and the EARN/OSI (DEC supported) projects did). 
3. And finally, it is sad to note that those who promoted public X.25 / X.75 networks for research 
networking (and vigorously opposed private leased lines networks, even if using X.25) failed to 
understand that the double buffering on links between switches and at X.75 gateways imposed 
inherent limitations on the performance of such networks, and made them unsuitable to meet the 
higher speed / volume needs of the research community.  (…and I won’t start on the ATM fiasco, 
another technology promoted by the EEC and supported by the same type of people!)”  
The comparison with the US is instructive in that telecommunications liberalization had already taken 
place in the early 1980’s, and there was a vigorously competitive telecommunications industry.  In 
addition the use of high speed leased lines (T1 at the time) for voice switch interconnection meant that 
pricing for bandwidth was cost based not monopoly policy based.” 
Regarding the intrinsic limitations of X.25, Paul Bryant adds that in a discussion with Peter 
Linington: “Peter claimed that all we needed was faster and faster lines and faster and faster electronics 
to solve any ISO problems. Also in X25 there was the link by link vs. end-to-end acknowledgement 
arguments”. 
While I agree with the above overall negative assessment of X.25 made by Dennis and Paul 
as it is indeed the case that X.25 was designed for low to medium (i.e. 2Mb/s) speed “dumb” 
terminal access, hence the reliable network layer, and therefore not well suited to intensive 
data transfers, I think that the negative comments about ATM are far too severe and should 
therefore be mitigated. I am not as convinced as Dennis about the ATM “fiasco”, clearly this 
technology had its limits, as it could not scale beyond 155Mb/s; however, it was designed to 
allow graceful coexistence of real-time and non-real time services which is still a “burning” 
issue. ATM was also widely used in ADSL access lines. Because of the need for circuit-
oriented technology across the Internet, ATM gave birth to MPLS, a kind of framed-ATM 
(i.e. packets instead of short 128 bytes cells) that is very popular as an ISP service
141
 and is 
highly
142
 priced [200] because of the associated QoS guarantees but does not fit very well the

Internet stack and is often referred to as a “layer 2.5” technology. In other words, Internet 
purists still consider it as a “violation” of the classic Internet layering introduced under the 
pressure of former PTT monopolies, like AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom. 
However, the “reliable network layer” debate may resurface despite the “All-IP” credo, as 
one cannot exclude that for some types of networks, e.g. sensors, actuators, there may be 
advantages, e.g. lower energy consumption, in relaxing the end-to-end constraints. 
6 The Advent of Global Electronic Mail and Web based 
Collaborations 
EARN/BITNET, as well as other operational electronic mail networks, provided a much 
needed breath of fresh air, as they essentially eliminated the cumbersome practice of having 
mailboxes on remote hosts, in order to exchange mail with local users that, in addition to being 
expensive, was very time-consuming and did not scale beyond a few remote hosts.  
Contrary to RARE/COSINE 
that mostly had a political 
agenda, EARN [1] and EUnet 
[201] had a clear service 
orientation and were very 
concerned by making optimal 
use of the scarce network 
bandwidth available; hence, 
there was strong cooperation 
between these two networks; in 
particular, there were many 
gateways between EARN and 
EUnet in order to keep the 
traffic as local as possible. 
Despite the fact that both 
UUNET 
 
[202] and EUnet 
predated BITNET 
 
[203] and 
EARN, it is not exaggerated to 
state that, it is EARN/BITNET 
that popularized the use of 
electronic-mail-based 
collaboration between scientists 
worldwide on a large scale. 
However, as rightly pointed 
out by Daniel Karrenberg the 
above statement is somewhat 
subjective as, although there was 
some overlap between these two 
networks, they were also clearly 
complementary depending on 
the branch of science 
concerned: “EARN typically 
connected the University 
computing centers and large 
Figure 4 EARN Topology in 1985 
 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 40 
research institutions. EUnet typically connected computer science departments and related research 
institutions. Furthermore EUnet was open to private industry. In addition EUnet had more sites than 
EARN
143
” 
One of the most convincing statements about the real impact of EARN/BITNET comes from 
Mark Humphrys, then a University College Dublin 
 
[204] (UCD) student in his “The Internet in 
the 1980s. [205]” article which is extremely well documented:  
“The whole thing (BITNET plus connected networks) was the embryonic Internet. The protocol 
has simply migrated to IP since, that's all! If BITNET was not the Internet, then neither was 
ARPANET before it switched to IP in 1983.” 
There are many reasons behind what I believe to be the historical truth, however, to be fair, the 
rapid growth of EARN would not have been possible without IBM’s seed-funding, whereas 
EUnet was self-funded by its users: 
1. The respective size EARN/BITNET and EUnet/UUNET in terms of users not sites 
and/or institutions. 
2. The form of “source routing” initially used144 by both UUNET and EUnet, i.e.  
hosta!hostb!host!user was very clumsy to use and prone to errors as routes were likely 
to evolve, furthermore the return path was unlikely to be symmetric!  
3. The somewhat longer delivery delays of UUNET/EUnet, one or more day in some 
cases, because of the use of low-speed phone lines, compared to the quasi-
instantaneous and reliable transmission of small mail messages as well as files offered 
by EARN/BITNET thanks to the use of leased lines.  
4. Access costs (i.e. (mostly145) dial-up for access to the EUnet core backbone vs. 
expensive leased lines for EARN, resulting in essentially orthogonal charging models 
i.e. variable vs. flat charges, a debate that is still going on today! 
6.1 The impact of CoCom rules on the penetration of EARN and EUnet 
networks in European Eastern Countries and the Soviet Union 
CoCom, an acronym for Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, was 
established in 1947, during the “Cold War” to put an embargo on some Western exports to “East 
Bloc” countries. There is no doubt that the CoCom rules had a stifling effect  on the countries 
concerned and contributed to accelerating the fall of the Berlin wall in November 1989 and the 
independence of many former communist countries in Eastern Europe. Since 1996, CoCom has 
been replaced by the Wassenaar Arrangement [206] but network equipments are no longer on the 
list of forbidden goods, however, export of cryptographic technologies remains strictly controlled 
[207]. 
After a careful study of the situation 
 
[208], EARN, under the leadership of Frode Greisen, was 
the first network to establish a leased line connection between Copenhagen and Warsaw in mid-
1991, however the formal admission to EARN of USSR and several East European countries that 
was agreed by the EARN Board in April 1990, triggered the CIA to commission networking 
experts to write a report titled: "Soviet and East European Computer Networking: Prospects for 
Global Connectivity" (CIA report SW 90-10054X, September 1990). This report was 
                                                 
143
 The real question that was the number of users actually served by each network was never clearly answered 
144
 The use of pathalias on some UUCP hosts alleviated the problem that was eventually solved by using RFC 822 
Internet mail addresses.

declassified, actually sanitized, in 1999 but is unfortunately no longer available on line from 
either [209] or [210] even though it is still listed.  
This report says that “the entry in April 1990
146
 of the USSR, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, 
Hungary and Poland into EARN is likely to have a profound effect on scientific communities 
throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe” and continues by saying that “the new EARN 
members will reap significant and immediate benefits by virtue of EARN’s links to hundreds of 
research centers on the US BITNET academic network as well as centers on many other Western 
networks”. The report goes on by stating that “While the East’s primary incentive to undertake 
computer networking is to increase the West-to-East flow of information, they believe this can 
only come to the cost of substantially opening up its own scientific communities”, a win-win 
situation, in the end! This report also acknowledges the fact that networks such as “UUCP
147
” 
“already link two institutes in Hungary and Czechoslovakia to the Western world, (but as) this is 
an extremely inexpensive form of networking based on telephone connections
148
 with established 
frequency, typically once per night, (thus) it can take some time for a message to pass to a distant 
recipient
149
”. The report also mentions “the increasing use of commercial services as 
COMPUSERVE that provides access to services such as data bases, news feed and electronic 
mail  and are accessible via the public telephone system, e.g. it is possible to send electronic mail 
from COMPUSERVE to non-commercial systems such as EARN and/or BITNET”. The interesting 
conclusion is that “the EARN decision was not opposed by the US government as, because of the 
inherent limitations of EARN and internetwork gateways, EARN was not viewed to be a threat as 
far as direct access to Western supercomputers, or so-called diversion in-place, was concerned”. 
The very restrictive CoCom rules explain the early presence of EUnet in Eastern European 
countries where, unlike EARN, the access technology used was not subject to export restrictions: 
1. Early EUnet presence in Eastern countries (i.e. former Czechoslovakia, Hungary, 
Soviet Union and Yugoslavia) according to the 1990 edition of “The European R&D 
E-Mail Directory” [211] by A. Goos and D. Karrenberg was made possible through 
the use of dial-up
150
 lines whose use could not be forbidden but whose speed was 
extremely limited (i.e. typically from 300 to 1200 bit/s). There is an excellent April 
1992 report
151
 from the RIPE connectivity working group titled “An overview of East 
and Central European Networking Activities” [212] that provides, as detailed as 
possible, a description of the various network activities in the East and Central 
European countries. 
2. Late EARN presence in Eastern countries as export of network technology was 
hampered by the CoCom 
 
[213] rules until mid-1991, the only exception being 
Yugoslavia
152
 [214]. Indeed a connection
153
 between Linz University and the Faculty 
of Natural Sciences and Mathematics in Belgrade was established in 1989 but had to 
be cut in 1992 following the UN sanctions that followed the break-up of former 
                                                 
146
 Actually the quoted date is that of the admission by the EARN Board, the physical connections only started to occur 
from 1991 (e.g. Warsaw-Copenhagen) 
147
 EUnet in this case 
148
 This statement is actually contradicted by Daniel Karrenberg who claims that as far as he remembers “at that time 
EUnet was actually using various forms of X.25 at least to SU, CS and HU.”  
149
 This statement, which is a reflection of the old image of EUnet in the mid-1980s, was no longer really appropriate 
in 1990.

Yugoslavia in 1991 and the ethnic wars. Paul Bryant recalls “traffic building up for 
Yugoslavia and tapes were sent between countries for a time to get rid of the files.” 
6.2 UUNET/EUnet 
In addition to being an electronic mail transport network, the main initial advantage of EUnet  
over EARN was the redistribution of USENET news [215]; however, given the huge success of 
USENET, the exponential increase of the volume of news was increasingly difficult to handle. 
Having predated EARN, EUnet had its aficionados, of course, and the two networks were 
somewhat in competition with each other, however, as their goals were very similar, i.e. fostering 
exchanges between scientists worldwide, this competition, actually a cooperation, was not only 
friendly but also synergetic. Whereas EUnet had a BSD
154 
[216] orientation, EARN used IBM 
protocols, thus already raising the issue of open versus proprietary software; though, in the early 
1980s, BSD Unix still shared the initial codebase and design with the original, “licensed”, AT&T 
Unix Operating System. BSD was widely adopted by vendors of workstation-class systems in the 
form of proprietary UNIX variants such as DEC ULTRIX and Sun Microsystems SunOS. 
Regarding the relative 
importance of these two networks, 
the already quoted 1990 edition of  
“The European R&D E-Mail 
Directory” [211] only lists 
institutions/sites and countries 
“500 Institutions in 24 countries” 
for EARN and “1600 sites in 22 
countries” for EUnet without any 
indication regarding the respective 
number of users and the related 
traffic; it is actually very surprising 
to find that, whereas NSFnet 
traffic statistics have been 
carefully kept in various forms by 
MERIT, it turned out to be 
difficult to find anything 
equivalent for either EARN or EUnet online
155
! However, thanks to Harri Salminen/FUNET
156
 
[217], I could retrieve the April 1991 traffic statistics for EARN/BITNET “International traffic 
volume by countries” [218] showing 25 Gigabytes/month between 47 countries (not counting 
national traffic) with the top country being, surprisingly or not, the most anti-EARN one, namely 
Germany, followed by France and the USA! If one removes the USA traffic, the International 
EARN traffic can thus be estimated to 21 Gigabytes/month, i.e. 69Kb/s, that sounds very little 
nowadays but was not completely insignificant back in 1991. The figure below shows that the 
NSFNET backbone traffic had a slow start before the emergence of the Web in 1992. The 
conversion of traffic from packets into bytes can be approximated as follows: half of the packets 
are 64 bytes (i.e. ACKs) while the other half, especially in the early NSFnet days, were 576 bytes. 
Hence, the scaling unit of 8 Billion packets roughly corresponds to 4*(64 + 576)*10
9 
= 640

155
 EARN statistics had to be sent to a central site where they were analysed. Although, there was some reluctance to 
do this with regularity, enough were received to get a good idea of traffic. These statistics were published in the EARN 
BOD papers regularly until the removal of the leased lines made them irrelevant. Paul Bryant still has those figures.

Gigabytes. Thus, in April 1991, the NSFnet backbone traffic can be estimated to be around 200 
Gigabytes, i.e. approximately 10 times the EARN/BITNET traffic.  
EUNET traffic, which was largely dominated by USENET was certainly much lower than 
EARN, probably by a factor 5-10; however, the number of USENET
157
 sites was undoubtedly 
much higher, as shown in Hobbes’ Internet Timeline [8]. 
However, other sources use the number of nodes as the metric to compare the respective 
impacts of EUnet vs. EARN which can be misleading, as what really mattered was the number of 
users
158
, one million or more around 1991 for BITNET/EARN [219]. Indeed, it is well known 
that EARN nodes were often big IBM mainframes, with many users, sometimes medium to large 
VAX/VMS, or UNIX systems, whereas single-user PCs with a 300b/s modem could easily take 
part in UUCP, unlike EARN users who relied on expensive leased lines between nodes.  
 
This analysis is actually confirmed by John Quarterman, in the “Size & Scope” section of his 
“Notable Computer Networks” article, where he states that “while number of hosts makes sense 
for CSNET like networks which are made of medium-size time-sharing systems and the exact 
number of users is hard to determine but can be very misleading in case of PC networks (one 
user/host) or large IBM style mainframes”. Indeed, CERNVM, the central IBM system at CERN, 
had several thousands of users, therefore “the right number may be the active number of 
mailboxes but this is difficult to know”! 
In any case, there are no doubts 
whatsoever that driven by Piet 
Beertema
159
 [220], Daniel 
Karrenberg and Glen Kowack, 
EUnet was a more dynamic and 
innovative networking organization 
than EARN. This may be due to 
the fact that, unlike EARN, EUnet 
did not have the Executive and 
BOD running them that made 
decision making a lot swifter. By 
1982, UUCP links were established 
between 4 countries (UK, 
Netherlands, Denmark and 
Sweden) thus forming the EUnet 
backbone with a star topology 
centered on MCVAX [221] in 
Amsterdam. Later the X.25 link 
between Amsterdam (CWI) and 
Sweden (KTH) was upgraded to 
64Kb/s and  was co-funded by EUnet, NORDUnet [222], HEPnet and EARN. These links were 
converted to IP over X.25 already in 1988. Likewise, the 64Kb/s X.25 link between Amsterdam 
                                                 
157
 Although today, Usenet has diminished in importance with respect to Internet forums, blogs and mailing lists, the 
groups in alt.binaries are still widely used for data transfer. Usenet differs from such media in several ways (e.g., 
Usenet requires no personal registration with the group concerned).  
158
 At its zenith around 1991, BITNET extended to almost 500 organizations and 3,000 nodes, i.e. probably 0.5 to 1 
million, if not more, users.

(Nikhef) and Geneva (CERN), co-funded by EUnet
160
 and Nikhef [223], established at the end of 
1989 played a significant role in the introduction of TCP/IP in Europe.  
6.2.1 Excerpts from EUnet history (Wikipedia):  
“To completely understand the importance and history of EUnet, it is important to realize that till 
the early 1990s nearly every European country had a telecommunications monopoly with an 
incumbent national PTT and that commercial and non-commercial provision of 
telecommunications services was prohibited or at least took place in a legal "grey zone". During 
the same period, as part of an industrial political strategy to stop US domination of future 
network technology, the EC embarked on efforts to promote OSI protocols, founding for example 
RARE and associated national "research" network operators (DFN, SURFnet, SWITCH to name 
a few).” 
6.3 EARN/BITNET 
6.3.1 How it all started 
Paul Bryant recalls “I remember how EARN started. Herb Budd and Alain Auroux did a tour of 
European sites drumming up support. My management thought they wanted to see what we were up to and 
so told me to show them round. At that time
161
 I was running a network of 20 or 30 multi-user mini 
computers spread around universities all running the full set of coloured books (UKERNA got jealous and 
so took it over as JANET). Having heard what they wanted I decided it looked good for our users - a free 
circuit to CERN so got the support of HEP and my management and didn't tell UKERNA. Since them I have 
never been all that welcome particularly when I got involved with the SHOESTRING project to run IP over 
JANET. I named it Shoestring as we were intending to do it for nothing using old DEC machines as 
routers. In the end they saw the light
162
!” For more details refer to paragraph 5.3. 
Similar visits were made in the future “core” EARN countries, including CERN, France, 
Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Scandinavia, Spain and Switzerland. At CERN, it coincided 
with the nomination of David Lord as Head of the new Communications System group, while 
Paolo Zanella was still heading the Data Handling division. Both were very pragmatic and 
understood the urgent needs for improved communications within the HEP community and 
beyond. The connection with BITNET, that was part of the EARN “deal”, was particularly 
attractive given the strong links with the HEP community in the USA. In Switzerland, the 
leadership was taken by Pr. Kurt Bauknecht (University of Zurich) while Pr. Jürgen Harm 
(University of Geneva), who was also very active in the setting-up of EARN although his “heart” 
was clearly in the RARE camp took this opportunity to accelerate the creation of the SWITCH 
foundation. 
6.3.2 Management and addressing 
Although administered by different entities EARN/BINET were forming a single domain
163
 
spanning all continents, in which BITNET had an undisputed leadership; however, given the 
European networking orientation of this article, the use of EARN is normally preferred to that of 
BITNET or EARN/BITNET. 
                                                 
160
 If my memory serves me right, CERN, as a key member of EUnet, also participated to the funding of this link as it 
actually helped to reduce CERN’s EUnet bill

Contrary to the belief of many people, EARN offered a rich set of services, however there were 
some “teething” problems: 
1. Neither EARN nor BITNET could be registered as top level domains in the Internet 
DNS (Domain Name Service) which then had very restrictive rules. Fortunately, the 
popularity of BITNET was such that most mail user agents and/or gateways knew how 
to deal with the unofficial .BITNET “top level” domain name, however, 
communications from outside the EARN world was rather clumsy
164
, namely: 
“user%bitnethost@bitnetgateway.edu”. 
2. The native EARN mail notation was the “user at host” notation, which was as much as 
a non-literate network user could understand back in 1984. Fortunately, the generalized 
use of RICE Mail as a User Agent as well as the Colombia Mailer as the Mail Transfer 
Agent (MTA) allowed the use of ARPANET addressing over EARN as well as access 
to Mail gateway to the TCP/IP world) 
During its last years, i.e. from 1992, EARN started to publish a very informative newsletter 
dubbed EARNEST. All 7 issues are still available from the University of Vienna server [224]. 
Issue number 4, December 1992 [225], provides interesting traffic statistics on EARN servers 
(Netnews
165
, Trickle
166
 [226]) and EARN.  
In a highly meritorious effort to widen its scope and become more network-user oriented in the 
emerging Internet world, the EARN Association produced a very successful “Guide to Network 
Resource Tools” [227] in September 1993, which is of high historical importance as it provides 
an exhaustive description of the networks tools available in these days in a network agnostic 
manner and, for that reason was even published in 1994 as an Informational RFC 1580 [228]. 
6.3.3 EARN protocols 
The terms NJE and RSCS networks are often improperly used as synonyms because of the 
popularity of EARN/BITNET whose IBM nodes
167
 were mostly using the VM operating system 
instead of MVS
168
. In practice, RSCS is the VM networking component enabling VM/CMS users 
to send messages, files, commands, and jobs to other users across the network using the NJE 
protocols. More generally, RSCS allows to interconnect nodes (systems, devices, and 
workstations) using links. These links allowed data, consisting mainly of CP spool files, to be 
transferred between the nodes using the NJE protocols; in other words, the right way to describe 
the early EARN protocols is NJE/RSCS. According to Paul Bryant: “most early file transfer like 
systems were for connecting a remote work station (card reader/line printer station) to a central machine 
and therefore lacked any addressing. I think NJE was the only such protocol that allowed files to be staged 
through a concatenated set of hosts.” 
To be more accurate, here is how IBM describes the respective roles of RSCS, NJE, BSC, SNA 
and TCP/IP [229] [230]: “Each link in an RSCS network is associated with a programming routine, 
called a driver, that manages the transmission and reception of files, messages, and commands over the 
link. The way that a driver manages the data is called a protocol. All file transmission between networking 
nodes uses NJE protocol, 3270 printers use 3270 data streams, workstations use RJE protocol, and ASCII 
printers use data streams appropriate to that printer. Systems Network Architecture (SNA) provides one set 
                                                 
164
 Arpanet style addresses looked like « Chinese » to the uneducated users of the 1980s 
165
 A more general term than Usenet that incorporates the entire medium, including private organizational news 
systems. 
166
 A file-forwarding service allowing EARN users to request a file from an FTP server on the Internet via a gateway 
server which was connected to both networks. 
167
 Less than 50% of the nodes 
168
 IBM’s mainline Operating System 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 46 
of protocols that governs communications on links. The method that RSCS uses for sending data to a node 
varies, depending on the type of connection used to establish the link. RSCS can support non-SNA (such as 
BSC
169
 [231] or channel-to-channel) or SDLC
170
 [232]), SNA, and TCP/IP connections.” 
The layered NJE protocol [233] was specified by IBM as an extension of the RJE
171
 [234] 
protocol to build networks with a focus on, but not limited to
172
, Network Job Entry and Output 
retrieval; the protocol supported multi-leaving
173
, compression (removing blanks and duplicate 
characters), connection procedures, etc.  
As correctly stated by Peter Sylvester (GMD) in his “NJE/OSI Service and Protocol 
Definition” document [235] “there were many hidden assumptions about the correct implementation of 
a partner;  the major reason being that the NJE protocol was first implemented and then  "formally"  
defined.”  
 BSC, a very basic byte oriented link layer protocol, and SDLC were de facto link layer 
protocol standards; SDLC served as input to ISO’s HDLC
174 
 [236] in 1979. IBM’s RJE and NJE 
being also de facto industry standards many Operating Systems, including DEC’s VAX/VMS 
with JNET
175
 and UNIX with UREP
176
, had NJE emulators; actually, most of the BITNET/EARN 
nodes were DEC computers but there were also some UNIX nodes, significantly including the 
EUnet node MCVAX at CWI.  
Whereas NJE/RSCS emulation software was commonly available, DECNET emulation was 
also available on IBM systems, e.g. Interlink [237]. 
For the ISO purists, running BSC or DDCMP [238] in the 1980s was a sheer “heresy”. 
However, for the pragmatists like Paul Bryant there were good reasons to use BSC: “In the UK we 
ran X25 over BSC for the pragmatic reason that HDLC equipment was unavailable
177
. It was very 
successful.” 
 Interestingly enough, there was a very similar situation between the Ethernet II frame format 
specified by DEC, INTEL and Xerox
178
  [239] that was widely deployed in LANs and the ones 
standardized by the IEEE as 802.2
 
[240] where, following the OSI model, a 3 bytes LLC
179
 
header was introduced, with two bytes for the source and destination SAPs and one control byte, 
at the expense of the Ethernet II frame type; this unfortunate decision created a lot of problems as 
IEEE could not allocate SAP
180
 values for “non-standard” protocols such as IP because of the one 
byte limitation, hence two versions of 802.2 called 802.2/LLC and 802.2/SNAP in which a 5 
bytes SNAP
181
 header is added through a special value of the LLC header in order to cater for 
proprietary protocols! As a result 802.2 framing was little used in practice on Ethernet but rather 
on new media like FDDI and Token Ring, however, that was not a problem for the standards 
supporters as, unlike IBM that was a bad company, DEC, Intel and Xerox were good companies.

Both NJE and RSCS shared interesting properties: 
1. NJE was not restricted to submitting jobs across the network or sending mail, it also 
included a file transfer protocol that allowed to send files to anybody across the network 
as files, not as mail enclosures, as well as an interactive message facility, similar to SMS 
messages, called TELL, two features still missing in native Internet protocols! Indeed, 
Jabber [241] was only invented in 1999. 
2. Sendfile, the unsolicited send file utility program was actually very interesting as the 
main characteristics of the file were automatically preserved (e.g., Binary vs. ASCII, 
variable length vs. fixed length records, creation/modification dates, etc.) via metadata 
headers appended to the file itself, Netdata format [242]. 
3. Hierarchical182 transport ensuring that the minimum number of copies would travel 
through the network. 
4. One serious problem with EARN/BINET was the transmission of large files that, given 
the limited bandwidth available between nodes (i.e. typically 9.6 Kb/s) was very 
problematic:  
a. Because they were given low priority and could therefore take weeks to travel 
from, for example, CERN to SLAC  
b. The maximum file size was limited to 1 Mbytes for operational reasons; 
furthermore any line hiccup would cause the entire file to be retransmitted.  
c. Les Cottrell  [243] from SLAC developed BITSEND that would automatically 
break up a file and transmit the pieces along with control information for putting 
them back together through BITRCV. A mechanism bearing some similarities 
with popular file distribution techniques such as BitTorrent and Akamai 
Download manager that are in wide use over today’s Internet, though on a 
completely different scale. 
5. RSCS can be seen as a way of implementing “Delay Tolerant Networking”  [244], also 
referred to as “Disruption tolerant networking” [245], and “in-network storage
183
, two 
very fashionable subjects these days!  
6. Last, routing was done by node name, which was operationally complex and required the 
monthly installation of new routing tables within the EARN/BITNET core in a quasi-
synchronized manner, but has also become fashionable again. Moreover, this allowed the 
underlying details to be hidden from the end-user, thus simplifying the “network 
experience”, much as domain names do today. 
7. Not directly connected to EARN but worth noting however: the VM “Pass-Through 
Facility (PVM)” [246] [247], a communications program used by VM users to access 
other systems independently of SNA that was far too complex and required lot of in-
house expertise. 
 
Excerpts from Wikipedia’s RSCS article [51]: “From a technical point of view, RSCS differed 
from ARPANET in that it was a point-to-point "store and forward" network. Unlike ARPANET, it did 
not require dedicated interface message processor or continuous network connections. Messages and 
files were transmitted in their entirety from one server to the next until reaching their destination. 
  
Key differences: 1) VNET was the first large-scale connectionless network, making it possible for a 
computer to join the network using dial-up lines, making connection inexpensive while ARPANET 
required dedicated 50kb lines at first (later raised to 230KB. Most leased lines at the time typically 
                                                 
182
 Assume a user on a node connected via a single link to EARN sending a file to several users located on different 
nodes, a single copy of the file will be sent over that link until it becomes necessary to fork the file along the tree rooted 
at the sending node.

operated at a maximum rate of 9600 baud. 2) VNET employed a vastly simplified routing and path 
finding approach, later adopted for the Internet. 3) VNET was a true “distributed control” while 
ARPANET required a “control” center.” 
 
6.3.4 RARE-EARN fights and the CEPT 
Needless to say the RARE and EARN organizations were engaged in a frontal confrontation 
and one cannot exclude the fact that the very restrictive CEPT [248] PGT/10 directive regarding 
the use of leased circuits, was used as a “pretext” among many others to prevent the emergence of 
EARN and/or to force EARN to develop an, X.25 based, OSI migration plan. 
Indeed, well before EARN started, leased circuits such as those of SPAN, the DECNET based 
NASA network that was extending to Europe, but also those between CERN and CEA as well as 
RAL were already well established.  In addition to being outrageously expensive, because of the 
“half-circuit” concept that was, in effect, (at least) doubling the price, leased circuits were also 
strongly regulated in Europe by the above CEPT recommendation, i.e. special forms had to be 
filled in order to support the request, e.g. multi-national companies, e.g. IBM, banks (SWIFT), 
airline companies (SABRE 
 
[249], SITA184 [250]) were allowed to establish private networks. 
However, the hidden purpose was clearly to perpetuate the very lucrative PTT monopolies and to 
force users to either transfer data on switched telephone circuits or to make use of the new public 
X25 based packet networks, e.g. Transpac in France from 1979, both of them being either time or 
volume charged. 
Fortunately, in March 1990, following the intervention of the Commission, the CEPT decided 
to revise the “dreaded” PGT/10 recommendation “on the general principles for the lease of 
international telecommunications circuits and the establishment of private international 
networks”; in effect, removing most constraints on the use of leased lines as most European PTTs had 
always done.  
 
Excerpts from “Guidelines on the application of EEC competition rules in the 
telecommunication sector
 
[251] (1991/C233/02)”:  This recommendation recommended, inter alia, 
the imposition of a 30 % surcharge or an access charge where third-party traffic was carried on an 
international telecommunications leased circuit, or if such a circuit was interconnected to the public 
telecommunications network.” In effect, these restrictions were mainly:  
1. making the use of leased circuits between the customer and third parties subject to the 
condition that the communication concern exclusively the activity for which the circuit has been 
granted, 
2. a ban on subleasing, 
3. authorization of private networks only for customers tied to each other by economic links and 
which carry out the same activity, 
4. Prior consultation between the Telecom Operators for any approval of a private network and of 
any modification of the use of the network, and for any interconnection of private networks. 
 
For the purpose of an exemption under Article 85 (3), the granting of special conditions for a particular 
facility in order to promote its development could be taken into account among other elements. This could 
foster technologies which reduce the costs of services and contribute to increasing competitiveness of 
European industry structures.  
 
Third party traffic was clearly the “stumbling block” for EARN as the potential user 
community was far bigger than those of HEPNET or SPAN, therefore, it is probably thanks to 
Article 85(3) that EARN was granted an exception and was allowed to start; however, some

 International Company of Aeronautical Telecommunications (Société Internationale de Télécommunications 
Aéronautiques) 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 49 
PTTs, like British Telecom, tried their best to force a “volume based” charges but had to abandon 
the idea because of practical difficulties as conformed by Paul Bryant: “I remember having to send 
BT our traffic figures so that they could charge us. Eventually they let me know that we would never be sent 
a bill. In fact I think that BT had no idea how to raise a bill based on figures supplied by the customer - 
indeed they had no suitable tariff to base the bill on.” 
 
Nonetheless, EARN had to comply with the above rules and IBM reached an agreement with 
CEPT under which EARN was temporarily allowed to start a leased lines network using IBM 
protocols, under the express condition that EARN would develop an OSI transition plan. This is 
confirmed by Paul Bryant, however, the real agenda was to use this pretext to get rid of EARN 
altogether: “Although EARN had to promise to move to OSI protocols and the public network I think that 
the last think anyone wanted was for EARN to actually convert. The whole idea was to stop EARN as soon 
as possible and lack of OSI and conversion would be a good leaver to stop the network. They thought 
conversion would be beyond our capabilities.”  
Indeed, the worse snubs EARN could inflict to RARE was to deploy an X.25 network just before them 
or nearly at the same time, admittedly with fewer access points than IXI  
This CEPT decision, that was maybe the result of a political “lobby” was, in any case, a clear 
abuse of power and a technical nonsense. Indeed, whereas Telecom Operators could, of course, 
refuse to lease lines according to CEPT PGT/10, because of “third party” traffic, they had no 
rights to impose additional restrictions, such as the exclusive use of OSI protocols, on those lines 
as, even in these PTT monopolies times, users were allowed to speak the language of their choice 
over public phone lines! 
Thus, the difference of treatment between public and private networks was not only plain 
wrong but also very unfair. Indeed, for the Telecom Operators “public” then meant use of 
switched 64Kb/s, X.25 or ISDN services, that, being either time or volume charged, were not cost 
effective solutions for establishing private networks
185
, also called CUGs [252], especially in the 
academic and research community.  
However, in the 1980s the PTTs had to make huge investment to digitize their phone and data 
networks. Because of the “universal services” principle, i.e. the selling of, for example, phone 
services (including installation fees) to the same price independently of geographical location (i.e. 
rural vs. densely populated areas), prices of voice traffic, for example, had little relation to costs. 
Furthermore, it was tempting for monopolies to “cross-subsidize” some services by others. In 
addition, the costs of the new optical networks were huge, e.g. the typical cost of a transatlantic 
cable, with 2-4 fiber pairs, was approximately 1 Billion US Dollar in the year 1990s; hence they 
were typical built by PTT consortiums in order to alleviate the financial risks, nonetheless the 
RoI
186
 was extremely unsure. 
 Thanks to the help of DEC, the European core backbone of EARN succeeded in running the 
NJE protocols on top of a minimal OSI TP0 transport-layer shim [253] and X.25 over 64 Kb/s 
leased lines, a great achievement indeed, but what did this really change?  
Later, these same NJE protocols were run on top of TCP/IP which was a far more effective 
solution.  
6.3.5 EARN/OSI 
When IBM stopped its financial support to EARN towards the end of 1987, the community 
was extremely annoyed as they had not fully integrated the idea that IBM’s funding would really

be limited to four years and isolated parts of the community, e.g., CERN, were not yet ready to 
self-fund themselves
187
. Furthermore, though the pressure from CEPT/Telecoms/EU to migrate 
EARN to OSI/X.25 was still very strong, the EARN community neither had the willingness nor 
the ability to fund such a network as such a transition required the use of SNA in order to make 
use of X.25. The only country strongly advocating for that solution was Germany through its 
representative to the EARN Board, admittedly in the crosshairs of DFN. This push was obviously 
related to the existence of the already mentioned AGFnet, a solid “interim” SNA/X.25 network in 
Germany. In the absence of any other solution and X.25 migration being considered as a priority, 
the proposal was nonetheless endorsed by the EARN Executive during the Nice meeting. Quoting 
Paul Bryant again “However, the EARN Executive's main concern was that it would be seen outside as 
supporting the view that IBM was taking over the networking world. In practice I don't think it caused any 
problems. This was at the same meeting that we looked at the IBM X.25 switch. Adopting that would have 
been a radical step. I never heard of anyone who had used such a switch and do wonder if it ever worked 
as opposed to being an X25 port into an IBM computer.” 
 
In any case, the EARN management had addressed the OSI migration issue very seriously 
from the beginning and an OSI transition team headed by Paul Bryant (RAL) had been formed 
but progress were slow given the complexity of the task due, among other things, to the scarcity 
of mature and well integrated OSI products. After numerous discussions and meetings, in 
particular a meeting in Heidelberg sponsored by IBM, the outcome, an extensive draft 
EARN/OSI proposal known as the “green book” [254], was presented by Paul Bryant in Perugia 
(Italy) in September 1987 under the close scrutiny of RARE impersonated by James Hutton, then 
secretary general of RARE. The unsatisfactory consensus reached, that was difficult to achieve, 
cost-wise, was to convert EARN into a private X.25 network
188
, which, as already mentioned 
above, implied the use of SNA therefore significant additional expenses.  
Paul Bryant was actually amazed by the mild recption of his OSI migration plan by the RARE 
activists: “I well recall the Perugia meeting where I presented the EARN plans with James Hutton and 
Nick Newman trying to do a hatchet job but failing as both lacked the technical background to understand 
the document. The plans that had already been presented at the RARE Networkshop in Valencia
189
 in May 
1987 had a very mixed reception. As I have already mentioned, the non-EARN community wanted to get rid 
of EARN not to see it actually migrate to anything. They wanted to run the networks and not have some 
organisation like EARN to run one. In other words, OSI as long as it is run by the national networking 
organisations, in other words national monopolies.”  
 
Apart from the very informative report produced by Harri Salminen titled “NORDUnet and 
EARN” [255] that provides a wealth of information about the sequence of events that led to the 
EARN/OSI project jointly sponsored by DEC and Northern Telecom and whose large excerpts 
are available in chapter 18.1, very few of the documents written during this period are available 
on line and, in particular, the “green book”!  
 
Thus, Dennis Jennings, who had just been elected president of EARN for the 2nd time and 
was very pragmatic, was the ideal man to convince DEC to play a key role in the EARN / OSI 
transition. Indeed, as reported by Harri Salminen, new support came into the picture between the 
September 1987 Perugia meeting and the May 1988 EARN board meeting in Çeşme (Turkey): 
                                                 
187
 According to Frode Greisen, there was no general EARN funding problem except for CERN but that particular 
problem was resolved by declaring CERN as the center of the network  
188
 In other words run RSCS over X.25 
189
 Where Nick Newman tripped over and broke his arm, perhaps because of the “irritation” caused by the presentation 
of the EARN/OSI migration plans! 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 51 
“First, DEC promised to support EARN’s OSI migration by providing hardware, software, technical 
expertise and a small grant for upgrading four lines to 64Kbit/s that would form a square EARN X.25 
backbone. Then Northern Telecom donated four large PTT-style DPN-100 X.25 switches, one DPN-50 
management switch, spare parts and training. Lastly IBM made new offers to support the availability of 
OSI/SNA software and hardware. In addition IBM offered co-operation with their new emerging EASINET 
initiative. During the May 1988 BOD meeting in Cesme (Turkey), EARN officially accepted all three offers, 
subject to further negotiations. During spring 1988 a new group called OSI-TEAM was formed to design a 
new OSI Migration plan which held several meetings that were sponsored by DEC that finally came to a 
conclusion that we needed some kind of gateways between NJE and OSI which we called G-BOXes” 
 
The joint offer of DEC and Northern Telecom
190
 [256], a leading Telecom provider of X.25 
switches, was difficult to refuse given that it offered significant added value to the existing EARN 
backbone, in particular much needed credibility with respect to the EARN/OSI transition, but also 
higher bandwidth (i.e. 64 Kb/s instead of a 9.6 Kb/s) inside the new EARN core. 
 
Back in 1988, the credibility of the newly announced IBM’s EASInet initiative was not very 
high and its success was still uncertain; furthermore, few people really believed that, thanks to its 
multi-protocol design, EASInet would actually provide a key part of the, not yet emerging, 
European Internet through the extension of NSFnet to Europe at CERN, whereas many others 
thought that EASInet was just a disguised way of promoting the use of SNA in Europe. In 
practice, EASInet facilitated the deployment of the European Internet and was instrumental in the 
establishment of Ebone. 
 
There is an excellent presentation by Niall O’Reilly [119] (UCD) about the EARN/OSI history 
that lasted about 2 years after a slow start around mid-1989 due to the rather odd manner in which 
DEC was handling the project, as a whole, and its logistical aspects, in particular.  
Like Niall O’Reilly, Paul Bryant disliked the way in which DEC managed the EARN/OSI 
project: “I was intensely irritated by, Odd Jorgensen, he threw away the work already done and started off 
with a rather juvenile brainstorming session to determine what to do. I rather stepped back at that point 
since DEC was intent on doing it their way and with staff paid by DEC - no advice needed.” In addition, 
“The NT switches were well over configured for the job. I was in favor of one of the cheap X25 switches 
that were becoming available, say, from CAMTEC. The NT switches took up an immense amount of floor 
space with dual power supplies and a lot of other unnecessary bells and whistles.”  
Although EARN/OSI was reasonably successful, technically speaking, it failed to become an 
appealing technical as well as political solution, therefore it did not last beyond its originally 
planned duration (i.e. 2 years or so) for several unrelated reasons:  
 
1. To a limited extent191, the emergence of IXI at more or less the same time in 1989-
1990; in reality, the predictable failure of X.25 as a scalable technology. 
2. The high prices claimed by DEC to continue providing the EARN/OSI service after 
the end of their sponsoring in 1991 also played a role; actually they shot themselves a 
                                                 
190
 On the occasion of its 100th anniversary in 1995 Northern Telecom, whose origin was Bell Telephone Company of 
Canada changed its name to NORTEL that filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and has been dismantled since then 
191
 As a software solution EARN/OSI was only depending on the availability of a private or public X.25; actually, 
several countries rejected from the very beginning the use of dedicated EARN/OSI lines (e.g. Ireland, Nordic 
countries). Tunisia was connected through a public switched data network and Germany was connected through IXI, of 
course! 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 52 
ball in their feet, but were they really willing to continue along, what proved to be, a 
dead end? 
3. The advent of EASInet, that brought a lot of additional bandwidth, as well as the 
wide adoption of Internet protocols in Europe, more or less at the same time as the 
ability to run RSCS over TCP/IP 
 
[257], also referred to as BITNET II. 
4. Last but not least, the revision of CEPT’s PGT/10 recommendation that removed 
restrictions on the use of leased lines and, in particular, the obligation to run X.25 
protocols.  
According to Paul Bryant: “The GBOX was the best outcome of EARN/OSI as it was a solid, 
VAX/VMS based multi-protocol gear with (DECNET, CLNP, X.25 and TCP/IP), however, the EARN/OSI 
failure was inevitable in the light of the move to IP. When conceived there was still a strong belief that OSI 
would succeed in Europe (if not the world). Had that come to fruition, I suspect that the EARN/OSI project 
would have had a longer life although in the light of the opposition from the NRENs it would no doubt have 
been an exciting ride!” 
Another interesting aspect of DEC’s EARN/OSI funding is that DEC wanted to demonstrate 
the advantages of managed networks in a “TELCO like” manner, whereas, ironically, IBM who 
was rightly seen as the “champion” of mainframes and SNA based solutions, i.e. centralized 
solutions, was in practice supporting “community managed” networks i.e. decentralized though 
not quite “self-organized” networks a concept that is gaining popularity with networks growth 
and the expected increase of new 
networked devices (RFID, sensors, 
actuators, etc.). 
Actually, the proof was made that 
“best effort” decentralized network 
management could work well, 
despite some unavoidable outages. 
This model should be compared with 
strictly managed networks with very 
constraining change management 
procedures, e.g. ITIL 
 
[258] that are 
both time-consuming and possibly 
de-motivating for the, not yet 
robotized, people, while also slowing 
down considerably the evolution of 
the IT infrastructure without even 
guaranteeing faultless operations. 
Niall O’Reilly, who was the Chief 
Technical Officer of EARN/OSI 
holds similar views about the 
interplay of organizational cultures 
during the time of the EARN/OSI 
project, not only between IBM and 
DEC, but between each of them and EARN, and also involving Northern Telecom, kindly 
provided many interesting and crisp details about this period in chapter 18.1 “EARN/OSI seen by 
its CTO”: “IBM's approach was both pragmatic and sophisticated.  It was perhaps an exemplary 
application of the "Subsidiarity principle": they contributed key resources which enabled the community to 
Figure 7 EARN Map 1994 (D. Bovio) 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 53 
do something useful, and avoided the kind of interference which would have increased their costs and 
simultaneously antagonized the beneficiaries.  They were clever enough not only to find the "sweet spot" on 
the cost/benefit curve, but also to take a relatively long-term perspective and not look for early and 
tangible pay-back… When implementation of the new deal with DEC and Northern Telecom (NT) began, 
NT took an even more "hands-off" position than IBM.  They contributed inventory, training and some 
support, during quite a short time window, and then more or less walked away, apparently content with 
whatever publicity or collateral benefit
192
 they could extract from the exercise
193
.  Both of these approaches 
suited a community of beneficiaries who simply needed resources to run their services, and were both 
aware of the requirements and competent to address them. DEC, however, took an approach which was 
less efficient, both for them and for the project for which they were the major sponsor….DEC seems not 
only to have been unable to comprehend and accommodate the culture within EARN of a network run by 
the participants for their own or their local customers' diverse needs, but also to have convinced itself that 
the EARN/OSI project was a campaign in a "turf war" with IBM, from whom DEC was going to seize 
operational control of the network and deliver the "benefits" of a "managed network" to the "customers"! 
6.3.6 The emergence of RSCS over TCP/IP and the end of EARN/BITNET  
During the early days of BITNET, IBM didn't offer a TCP suite. Around 1985, Matt Korn 
from Wisconsin University wrote a full TCP/IP package known as WISCNET, which IBM later 
sold as a supported product for both the VM and MVS environments. However, VMNET, i.e. 
RSCS over TCP/IP was developed by Princeton University
194
. Michael Gettes recalls that when 
Matt Korn moved to IBM; “he met Barry Appelman and Jay Elinsky and others who all ended up at 
AOL along with David Lippke [259] from University of Texas.  If you will recall Lippke was instrumental 
in BITNET - he and I always talked of creating "FredNet" which would entail the best of NJE features like 
Instant Messaging on a massive scale.  Well, it was Lippke, Elinsky, Korn and crew who brought AOL 
Instant Messaging to the world and forever changing the IM landscape!” 
 
In 1986 the NSFnet Program provided funding to BITNET to support the TCP/IP protocol 
suite and to integrate it into the NSFnet as a mid-level community network. 
 
Following the availability of VMNET, i.e. the possibility to run RSCS over the Internet 
instead of requiring dedicated lines, the BITNET II proposal made by Michael Gettes
195
 in 
February 1990 was widely adopted throughout the EARN/BITNET world during the 1990-
1992 period and, as explained above, was one among several other reasons that led to the 
demise of NJE/OSI. Indeed, the new possibility, that basically eliminated the need for 
dedicated EARN lines, met some resistance from the EARN Executive.  
 
Whereas the 1
st
 VMNET link was established between CERN and Princeton during the 1
st
 
quarter of 1990, due to exceptional circumstances
196
, it took almost another year to the EARN 
Executive and finally the EARN Board to agree on the EARN Regionalization plan proposed 
by Daniele Bovio
197
 in collaboration with the EARN routing group and Michael Gettes 
(BITNET) [260].  
                                                 
192 I seem to recall that NT's selection as supplier and sponsor of X.25 equipment for EARN was significant in 
enabling them to win other business in the academic community, and that either DFN and/or SURFnet was mentioned, 
but I am sure that NT didn't waste resources in useless follow-up to their well-defined contribution to the project. 
193
 Maybe they were already well aware of the imminent death of X.25 and were concentrating their efforts in other, 
more promising, technological directions like ATM (comment from O. Martin)

According to Paul Bryant the issue was a timing one: “I don't think the Executive or BOD were 
against NJE/IP or the regionalisation project. I think that things were moving very fast and the 
Executive and BOD did not meet often enough to keep up with the changes”, however, Daniele Bovio 
remembers the embarrassment of the EARN Executive “that was still very scared of all the X.25 
OSI bullshit. I remember them all wondering if they could afford to have EARN so blatantly embrace 
the TCP/IP technology while the OSI debate was barely over.” 
The service-oriented EARN organization having recognized that it had more or less lost its 
“raison d’être” when Internet protocols and backbone lines started to flourish throughout the 
world, is one of the very few organizations that decided its own obsolescence. BITNET did 
the same around the same time in 1996, although some kind of minimum EARN over TCP/IP 
service was maintained on a voluntary basis by Hans-Ulrich Giese
198
 and Michael Gettes 
which was mainly useful for IBM users. 
6.3.7 EARN presidents:  
Dennis Jennings
 
[261] was the first EARN president during its early 1983-1984 period, before 
EARN was incorporated in 1985 and before he moved to the USA (on leave from UCD) to lead 
the implementation of the NSFNET Programme (1985-86), the inter-network that is really at the 
origin of the Internet as already explained in chapter 2.4. 
David Lord (CERN) was the 2
nd. 
EARN president (1984-1987) and when Dennis Jennings
 
came 
back to Europe he was re-elected as the 3
rd
 EARN president (1987-1988) at a difficult time where 
IBM seed-funding was about to stop. Unlike David Lord who was very close to IBM, Dennis 
Jennings was not particularly “pro-IBM” which actually paved the way to DEC’s EARN/OSI 
initiative and despite some fears, because of his prior involvement in NSFnet, did not try to push 
TCP/IP. Paul Bryant recalls: “When Dennis returned from NSFnet many members of the Executive and 
BOD were worried that he would try and turn EARN into some form of IP network. We thought that such a 
direction would set us against the NRENs in a big way and we would probably lose any battle, maybe a 
mistake!” 
Frode Greisen (4
th
 and last president 1989-1995) organized the transition of EARN from leased 
lines to TCP/IP and later became the 1
st
 president of TERENA, but not for very long (i.e. seven 
months), he also become the General Manager of Ebone from 1992 to 1999. 
6.4 The sad X.400 and EAN saga 
EAN (Electronic Mail Agent) was developed by and for CDNnet [262] the original registry 
for .ca. The EAN designers at the University of British Columbia took a very pragmatic approach 
with respect to X.400 addressing namely that of being compatible with RFC 822, i.e. Internet 
mail addresses. However, those addresses were internally converted to X.400 format, which 
meant that between two EAN systems addressing was the same as Internet style addresses, 
however, they were mapped to X.400 internally before being converted back to RFC 822. This 
pragmatic approach, i.e. taking into account the fact that interoperability with the Internet world 
was already of  prime importance was very much disliked by the X400 purists such as Pr. 
Bernhard Plattner (ETH Zürich) and Pr. Jüergen Harms (SWITCH), but also Peter Kaufmann 
(DFN), who very much preferred the “beauty” of X400 addressing namely: /C=GB /ADMD=BT 
/PRMD=DES /O=UCS /OU=CS /S=KILLE instead of steve@cs.ucl.ac.uk (ARPANET style) or 
steve@uk.ac.ucl.cs (UK “Coloured Book”)!

Not the least of all X400 challenges was competition between Universities, shaky User Agents 
written by students that were not ripe for production use, as well as loss of attributes given that 
some X.400 protocol implementations were richer than others.  
 
Steve Kille authored native X.400 and X.500 user agents, called “PP” and “QUIPU”, was also 
at the origin of the ISODE consortium which met a number of successes by proposing pragmatic 
solutions, e.g. standardizing access over TCP/IP to X.500 directories via LDAP. 
 
There are three excellent articles by Denise Heagerty (CERN): “Practical Experience with 
High Level Gateways for Mail Transfer
199
” [263], “Experience with Mail gateways and 
Transition to X.400
200
” 
 
[264], and Maria Dimou (CERN): “The Email Gateway Manager 
Reminiscent of Sisyphus
201
” [265]. 
 
The merging of EARN and RARE into TERENA happened in October 1994 and use of X.400 
by some activists continued for some time. Paul Bryant is actually questioning this merger and 
wonders “what if EARN had merged with RIPE? We were both interested in operating networks 
rather than politics.” However, this was not an option as the trend was clearly towards “burying 
the hatchet”, furthermore, as explained in the minutes of the 24th RARE CoA meeting (October 
1992) under the heading “RELATION RARE/RIPE REDEFINED” [266]: “RARE and RIPE will 
remain independent bodies. The CoA agreed that RARE will continue to rely on RIPE for the coordination 
of IP activities -  and not establish its own IP coordination group - , while RIPE will rely on the RARE 
Technical Committee and IETF for the setting up of a technical development plan. To enable close 
cooperation between RIPE and the RTC, RARE has invited RIPE to appoint a representative on the RTC. 
With regard to the RIPE NCC, the CoA agreed that it should remain under the umbrella of RARE until at 
least the end of 1993, even if the funds for operation of the RIPE NCC were to be channeled via the 
Operational Unit.” 
 
Regarding the IETF, twenty six RFCs related to interworking/mapping between X.400 and 
RFC 822/MIME were issued during the period 1986-1998, followed by RFC 3854 and 3855 
about the use of S/MIME for securing X.400 content and transporting secured content over X.400 
transport networks, in contrast, nearly 100 RFCs are related to LDAP during the period 1993-
2011! 
According to me, X.400 was far from being a bad standard. It was a very complete, though 
complex, standard that had much better functionality than its Internet Mail counterparts (i.e. RFC 
822 and SMTP), a potential advantage that was not exploited at all. Indeed, instead of selecting 
an ambitious X.400 profile that could have made X.400 more attractive than SMTP, a very 
conservative profile was adopted by the RARE MHS working group; while the IETF was fast 
developing and also implementing MIME!  
However, Paul Bryant strongly disagrees with this rather positive opinion of X.400 and is 
adamant in stating that “it was a bad standard as it suffered the problem of most OSI protocols in that 
there were options and it was all too easy to develop products that were correct implementation but would 
not interwork.” And is adding that: “he once gave a talk to a UK Networkshop entitled "Minimal 
Irreducible protocols" that made the case for protocols to have no options at all – it did not get taken 
seriously.” 
The electronic mail MINT gateway, that was actually the result of the COMICS
 
study led by 
Ulf Beyschlag, turned out to be a very popular and useful service, provided by CERN for the

6.5 The Birth of the Commercial Internet and the World Wide Web  
There were actually two very unique features in the early Internet, dynamic, Interior as well as 
Exterior, Routing protocols 
 
[267] (i.e. IGP and EGP), and the Internet Domain Name System 
(DNS) [268]. Indeed, back in 1985, Paul Mockapetris [269] (ISI) and Jon Postel identified the 
early Internet problem of holding name to address translations in a single table on a single host, 
and instead proposed a distributed and dynamic DNS database, a great leap forward that was 
probably one of the main reasons to the success of the Internet despite the fact that in the pre-
World Wide Web period, i.e. 1992, its functionality was actually rather poor, i.e., the file transfer 
facilities were very awkward, SMTP Mail servers were very primitive, but there were a few 
emerging indexing and archiving tools such as Archie
 
[270],  Gopher
 
[271], WAIS
202
. 
 
Likewise, the early implementations of the Web browsers were primitive at their inception 
back in 1990-1991, i.e. a dumb-terminal oriented Web with HTTP and HTML already well-
developed, with Hypertext [272] links highlighted and followed by pressing the “Enter” key or 
scrolled over. But, it was an already very integrated and nicely built environment with interfaces 
to the most popular Internet tools and services such as Email (SMTP, UUCP/Unix), ftp, telnet, 
News, Archie, Gopher, etc.  
The Web was demonstrated in many conferences and, in particular, at the EARN Network 
Services Conference in London in November 1994 where Paul Bryant “organised an IP link to the 
hotel. In fact it was an ISDN connection (128K) with the connection ending at a PC running freeware 
programs PCROUTE and “packet driver” in order to run TCP/IP [273]. SUN lent us a dozen machines for 
the event.”  
In 1993, Mosaic [274], a graphics enabled browser, the precursor of Netscape [275], received 
almost immediate acceptance from the Internet community at large, and especially the emerging 
commercial Internet. Since then, Web protocols and technologies have been under constant 
evolution, however, it is customary to distinguish the following phases, Web 1.0, the static Web, 
from 1992, Web 1.5, the dynamic Web around year 2000, then Web 2.0
 
[276], since 
approximately 2004. Social networks started to emerge with Web 2.0 in the form of services such 
as Facebook, MySpace and Twitter, Blogs, Wikis, photos and videos sharing sites, etc. One likely 
reason for the meteoric success of the Web, that shares many similarities with that of the Internet, 
was its initial simplicity; indeed HTTP 1.0 was rather primitive and was actually a simple 
extended version of SGML
203
 [277] that was actively supported by Chris Jones (CERN). SGML, 
a derivative of IBM’s GML, was standardized by ISO in 1986 under the impulse of Charles F. 
Goldfarb (IBM) with contributions from Anders Berglund (CERN) who later joined ISO.  
There is another interesting paper by Maria Dimou (CERN) prepared for the South African 
Conference on Web applications in 1999 that shows the, then emerging, trend towards using 
commercial rather than home-made products [279]. 
The 20
th
 anniversary of the birth of the inception of World Wide Web was celebrated at CERN 
in March 2009 [280]

6.6 Tentative conclusions 
Although the use of proprietary protocols was the rule rather than the exception nobody 
seriously wished that situation to continue for too long! 
 
What would have happened if neither IBM nor DEC had helped the European Academic and 
Research community at times where creating new networking budgets was very difficult? Indeed, 
apart from the large worldwide scientific communities (e.g. Space, HEP, Magnetic Fusion) where 
the case for mission-oriented networks was well understood, the sheer notion of communicating 
with the scientific community, at large, was less well understood! 
 
Well, it is likely that the use of USENET, remote login, BBS
204 
[281] and Computer 
Conferencing Systems, such as KOM 
 
[282] and EuroKOM, would have continued to increase in 
parallel with the development of mission-oriented networks. 
 
IBM was clearly the first to inject very significant amount of seed-funding, thus greatly 
contributing to the success of EARN but also BITNET by giving a worldwide scope to these 
compatible, interoperable, but independently managed networks. Later, IBM made another, even 
more decisive, step with their EASInet initiative that led to the birth of the European Internet 
with, in particular, a T1 (1.5Mb/s) connection to NSFNET between CERN and Cornell 
University.  
 
However, the role of DEC should certainly not be underestimated as, without the DEC 
funding, the EARN community could have met serious problems.  
 
Of course, both IBM and DEC, especially DEC, had a hidden agenda, publicity was one, 
competition between these two leading computer manufacturers was another, OSI was also at 
stake, DEC was eager to show that it was heading in the right direction with Ethernet, that 
became standardized by IEEE, and the DECNET/OSI migration that never happened, although it 
almost succeeded, then its IETF activity for IPng with the TUBA proposal, very similar in 
essence to the approach taken by the ISODE
 
consortium that later became ISODE
 
Limited [283].   
7 Global Networking Organizations and Initiatives 
7.1 Coordinating Committee for Intercontinental Research Networking 
(CCIRN)  
The first CCIRN [284] meeting was co-hosted by CERN and the University of Geneva in May 
1988 and represented the first attempt to harmonize the inter-regional operation of the emerging 
worldwide research networks. There is a most interesting article published in the CERN 
Computer Newsletter article [285] [286] by François Fluckiger that throws some light on the first 
CCIRN meeting that also had some influence on the establishment of RIPE and the subsequent 
deployment of the European Internet.  
However, there were many other such meetings between the US and Europeans prior to 1988, 
according to Peter Kirstein: “the first meeting between NSF people and Europeans in October 1984 
should be classed as a milestone. This meeting was on a Friday/Saturday, preceding an ARPA SATNET 
project meeting on the Monday/Tuesday. At that time NSF had asked me to arrange a meeting with various 
                                                 
204

Europeans, but refused to have a meeting joint with ARPA. It was only on the Sunday that both groups 
agreed to meet socially.” 
The main purpose of CCIRN was global cooperation between national peers, in other words, 
EARN was not welcome, and one of the “hot subjects” was coordination of transoceanic links, 
making sure, in particular, that they would be consolidated into as few “big pipes” as possible, a 
good idea in principle, but also that they would be landing at the right places. Amsterdam, 
Geneva (CERN), Paris and Stockholm, for example, were among the places to avoid because of 
their early support of both EARN and Internet; another reason was the cooperation of KTH 
(Stockholm) and RENATER (Paris) in the GIX
205
 [287] [288]. 
 
To be fair, it was the CCIRN European delegation, i.e. RARE and later DANTE, who were 
attempting to twist this “thorny” issue in their favor. 
 
Fortunately, CCIRN miserably failed to prevent the unavoidable from happening; indeed, 
DANTE’s “topologists” were, in the end, forced to build networks around the main data sources! 
 
Another very hot issue was cost sharing; indeed, for various historical reasons and, apart from 
the five, DARPA
206
 funded, satellite lines [289] to Germany, Italy, Norway
207
 (NORSAR
208
) 
[290] and UK (UCL and RSRE
209
), and the US DoE
210
 funded links to CERN, Europe was paying 
the full cost of the transatlantic circuits which was viewed as “unfair”. 
 
However, there were also good reasons why some organizations preferred to connect directly 
to the US like:  1) Higher standing 2) Lower prices of transatlantic circuits compared to intra-
European ones, hence lower costs at the expense of longer transit times to connect, for example, 
Stockholm to Madrid via the USA, back in the early 1990s 3) Better connectivity to the Internet, 
hence better QoS.  
 
Indeed, as correctly analyzed by André Choo (Teleglobe), the Internet was then largely “US 
centric” due to the fact that most Internet content was located in the US; hence, as shown in “IP 
traffic measurements
 
 at CERN” [291], a joint article by J.M. Jouanigot, Jessica Yu and myself 
presented at INET’93, the traffic was completely unbalanced in the West to East direction (i.e. 
most of the traffic traveled Eastwards).  
 
So, a fair solution to the transoceanic links cost sharing problem could have been to contribute 
proportionally to the ratio of inbound vs. outbound traffic. In the mean time the problem has been 
solved as the traffic is, I believe, balanced, the landing points in the USA are on the East coast 
and NSF is sharing the costs with the EC through DANTE.

 Global Internet eXchange usually means the MAE-East Internet exchange point in Washington DC, USA, which 
could also be referred to as a de-facto “NAP".  There have been plans to physically distribute the GIX and thereby 
create a "D-GIX".

 As the first ARPANET connection outside the United States, NORSAR's TIP was installed in June 1973 and 
became operational in July 1973 a few minutes before the TIP in London, a matter of national pride in Norway as in 
Scandinavia.  A communication link between Kjeller (NORSTAR) and London (UCL) was also established. Sheer 
objectivity obliges to say that these two historical links became operational at the same time and that the UCL one had 
a much larger impact as it was used as a gateway to the UK research community and thus served a much wider user 
community.

7.2 Intercontinental Engineering Planning Group (IEPG) 
In the USA several Internet Engineering Planning Groups (EPG) in the USA had already been 
established. The two Federal Internet exchange Points (FIX) [292], established under the auspices 
of the FEPG
211
 in June 1989, were policy based network peering points where U.S. federal 
agency networks, such as the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNET), NASA Science 
Network (NSN), Energy Sciences Network (ESnet), and MILNET were interconnected:  
 
1. FIX-East, at the University of Maryland in College Park  
2. FIX-West, at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California.  
 
FIX-East and FIX-West were eventually expanded to become MAE-East [293] and MAE-
West [294] two of the five NSF supported NAP
212
 [295]. MAE-East was a fiber ring around 
Washington DC, based on MFS
213
 technology, and for historical reasons “was the nearest thing 
we had to a "center" of the Net
214
”. 
 
The GIX proposal was made by Guy Almes, Peter Ford, and Peter Löthberg during the June 
1992 IEPG meeting in Washington DC in order to facilitate the interconnection of academic and 
commercial networks in one place. The proposal was further evolved into the D-GIX
215
 [296] at 
MAE-East
216
, KTH (Stockholm) and RENATER (Paris). The D-GIX was based on a route server 
and routing registry prototypes developed by the RIPE-NCC and deployed at the above three 
places. Most Internet Exchange Points in the world do include nowadays some kind of “route 
server” service.  
 
There is no doubt that MAE-EAST had had a real impact; however, I am unable to judge the 
real impact of the GIX, in general, and the D-GIX, in particular, and whether it has ever been 
used operationally. 
  
NSFnet also had its own Engineering Planning Group (EPG) and, in order to coordinate the 
activities on a more global scale, the creation of the IEPG was decided during the 1990 Killarney 
meeting in order to include engineers from Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.   
  
The founding meeting was held in Vancouver (Canada) in July 1990 before the 18
th
 IETF 
meeting, there were very few participants, including Vint Cerf, Elise Gerich (MERIT), Bill 
Bostwick (DoE) and three Europeans, Erik Huizer (SURFnet), Fernando Liello (RARE) and 
myself. Unfortunately the minutes of this meeting are not available from the official IEPG sites. 
However, the minutes of this 18
th
 IETF meeting [297] are still available where it is stated on page 
8 that: “We were especially pleased to have a delegation from the European networking 
association RARE at the IETF. Erik Huizer (SURFnet, Netherlands), Rüdiger Volk (RIPE, 
Dortmund Univ), Fernando Liello (INFN, Italy), and Olivier Martin (CERN, Switzerland). Erik 
and Rüdiger gave a presentation on networking activities in Europe.”

The IEPG mandate evolved over time from an initially very restricted set of Internet 
engineers, gathered under the auspices of the CCIRN, to “an informal gathering that meets on the 
Sunday prior to IETF meetings. The intended theme of these meetings is essentially one of 
operational relevance in some form or fashion - although the chair will readily admit that he will 
run with an agenda of whatever is on offer at the time!” 
 
The first IEPG official meeting was held a few months afterwards in Santa-Fe in October 
1990, one of the main agenda item was about the “rationalization” of transoceanic circuits. 
Bernhard Stockman was tasked with maintaining a database of all such links and I was tasked 
with explaining the pros and cons of merging the multitude of small, typically 64 Kb/s circuits 
into bigger “pipes” typically T1, possibly T3 later.  
7.3 Global Interoperability of Broadband Networks (GIBN) 
Like many high-level political initiatives that are launched “in the air” without any funding 
behind, GIBN raised lot of hopes but led essentially nowhere, despite some donations such as the 
155 Mb/s transatlantic Teleglobe circuit. There are two main reasons behind the failure of GIBN: 
1) lack of public funding 2) prohibitive costs of the tail circuits that were grossly underestimated.  
The information below is extracted from presentations made by Yves Poppe (TATA, formerly 
Teleglobe): 
“In October 1994 Teleglobe and its partners inaugurated CANTAT-3 [298] with two fiber 
pairs, capacity of 5 Gigabit (2x2.5 Gb/s) linking Canada to the UK, Germany, Denmark, Iceland 
and the Faroe Islands. Doubled the capacity under the Atlantic 155 Mb/s was earmarked for 
data. Engineering estimated 17 years to fill the cable! 
1. Towards GIBN: 
 
1.1. During the meeting in Naples in July 1994, President Clinton urges the G7 nations to 
develop an international information infrastructure. The G7 agreed to hold an ministerial 
conference on Information Society in Brussels Feb 1995 meeting hosted by the 
European Union combined with a major industry leaders meeting and technology 
showcase 
1.2. During the Brussels conference in February 1995, Teleglobe agreed to provide a 
transatlantic STM-1 (155 Mb/s) on the new CANTAT-3 cable for the showcase and 
Deutsche Telekom agreed to connect the European continental part through JAMES
217
 
[299]. In addition, 11 pilot projects were identified including the “Global 
Interoperability of Broadband Networks” (GIBN) but also “Environment and Natural 
resources Management”, “Electronic Museums and Galleries”, “Global Marketplace for 
SMEs” 
1.3. The fist GIBN meeting took place in Paris in January 1996. The United States, 
represented by Steve Goldstein (NSF) [300], proposed a number of high performance 
computing and communications candidate applications that would utilize 
intercontinental high performance communications links. As part of the Canadian 
contribution, Teleglobe donated the Cantat-3 STM-1 to CANARIE
218
 [301], the 
Canadian NREN, for a “two year” period. In turn, Japan got connected with a 45Mb/s 
satellite link.

After a successful set of transatlantic demos in Brussels, the transatlantic portion of the link 
connecting CANARIE to BERKOM [302], the then Deutsche Telekom R&D arm in Berlin, was 
maintained. A number of projects between the CRC
219
 [303] and Europe were completed using 
this link. This included the first transatlantic native IPv6 transmission, participation in the first 
multisite conferences under the ABC series. BERKOM also concluded a number of demos and 
tests with their subsidiary at the University of Berkeley using a connection between Teleglobe 
and Sprint at the time. In the meantime the Teleglobe and KDD provided 45mb satellite between 
Canada and Japan allowed for the first transcontinental very high definition videoconferences. 
 
The multisite ABC
220
 conferences [304], where CRC collaborated with Pr. Juan Quemada 
(UPM
221
) [305] had multiple sites in Europe connected through JAMES and using the Isabel 
software [306], are worth mentioning as these were really world premieres and were without any 
doubts well ahead of their time; however, despite the fact that Isabel is still alive and “well”, it 
failed to have the lasting impact it would have deserved, why? Here are some possible reasons, 
first of all, back in the early 1990s, high definition video conferencing implied the use of 
expensive Parallax graphics cards only available on SUN SPARC workstations, second, although 
(perhaps) because the Isabel application was both extremely innovative and features rich, its 
stability left much to be desired, last, the design team opted for open source software far too late.  
Nonetheless, the third TERENA European Network Performing Arts Production workshop [307] 
was hosted by the “Gran Teatre del Liceu” in Barcelona in June 2011. A virtualized Isabel service 
in the cloud is offered by the social Website Global Plaza [308] which supports collaborative 
spaces where Isabel sessions can be organized with automatic MCU, streaming and recording set-
up for the virtual meeting.  
 
2. The end of GIBN: 
 
2.1. From 1995 onwards, the Internet tsunami took everybody by surprise; CANTAT-3 was 
full in less than 3 years and, thanks to the introduction of DWDM cables of 1000 times 
the capacity of CANTAT-3 were installed during the following five years, i.e. by year 
2000. 
2.2. Deregulation, easy access to capital, advances in laser and fiber technology and 
spectacular Internet growth created a new generation of Global cable builders: Global 
Crossing [309] , Level3 [310], FLAG [311], 360networks [312] and resulted in a 
plethora of transmission capacity under the commonly held belief that traffic would 
continue to double every 90 days. 
2.3. The predictable result was that capacity prices plummeted that, at last, allowed the 
Research and Education community to build properly dimensioned networks at 
affordable prices. Unfortunately, as the underlying economic model was not viable this 
led to the bankruptcy of many Telecom Operators, including TeleGlobe. 
7.4 IETF 
7.4.1 IPng and IPv6 
Back in 1992, i.e. only a few years after the end of the “protocol war”, the IPv4 Internet 
became a victim of its own success and was then facing severe architectural problems with the

rapid exhaustion of the “class based”, i.e. A/B/C, address space that was threatening its very 
future in the fairly near term, hence an urgent need for a new version of IP provisionally dubbed 
IPng
222
.   
This was perceived as an opportunity by the OSI supporters but also by many others and lot of 
efforts was therefore invested in the IPng activity resulting into many proposals [313] submitted 
to the IETF: TUBA, IPAE, SIP and PIP that later merged as SIPP, CATNIP, CNAT, and Nimrod.  
The IETF ROAD
223
 working group quickly specified the “Technical criteria for bigger 
addresses” in RFC 1380
 
 [314] by P. Gross. 
A variant of  DECNET Phase V, an ISO/OSI conformant network protocol, was proposed as a 
contender for IPng to the IETF under the name TUBA
224
, RFC 1347 [315], and was rejected for a 
number of  good technical reasons, e.g. slight semantic differences between CLNP using ISO 
NSAP
 
[316] addresses (up to 160 bits) but bad technical reasons too, e.g. “not invented here” 
syndrome, general mistrust of the IETF community towards ISO/OSI based protocols
225
, too 
visible political support of OSI protocols by the European Union
226
 but also, strangely enough, by 
the US National Bureau of Standards (NBS), aka NIST. This dispute was also fueled by the 
CONS
227
 [317], pushed by the European PTTs, against CLNS
228
 [154] controversy.  
Regarding the IPv4 to IPng migration, the dual-stack strategy that was adopted has, without 
doubts, been strongly influenced by the one proposed by DEC for the graceful migration to 
DECNET phase V, that made lot of sense in small networks with a rather limited number of hosts 
and sites. However, it is interesting to note that DECNET phase V transition was actually stopped 
by DEC itself, given unforeseen technical difficulties (e.g. the use of “hidden areas” as a way to 
extend the network) but also organizational, economic, and marketplace reasons. Nonetheless, if 
the IPv6 transition had been started then, it might well have worked out all right, although this 
was unlikely given the immaturity of IPv6 in those days, a situation that  persists today (almost 
20 years later), but to a much lesser extent, strange as it may seem! Accordingly, the dual-stack 
IPv6 migration is half dead because, in order to work, each new Internet host must have an IPv4 
address in addition to its IPv6 addresses which is no longer possible except for the early Internet 
users such as CERN who have been allocated more than enough IPv4 address space.  
Hence, NAT64 [318] or like proposals allowing IPv6 only users to access the IPv4 Internet. 
RFC 1454 [319] “Comparison of Proposals for Next Version of IP” was written by Tim Dixon 
(RARE) in May 1993, explaining the numerous weaknesses of IPv4 (e.g. QoS, Multicast) and 
also comparing the pros and cons of the three main IPng proposals submitted to the IETF, 
namely: PIP, SIP and TUBA, with a slight bias for TUBA. Tim Dixon also made the following 
interesting observation “There is an inbuilt assumption in the proposals that IPng is intended to be a

 TCP/UDP over Bigger Addresses 
225 A strong reason for this mistrust was that the ISO and ITU (then CCITT) standards were developed in a hierarchical 
manner at “glacial” speed and often including too many options for political reasons, another issue is that these 
standards were not freely distributed as were the Internet RFCs. Actually, the free distribution of RFCs was a kind of 
revolution in the days of proprietary protocols and architectures and was a very significant factor in the success of the 
Internet protocols. The same comment also applies to open protocols such as the Web and open software. 
226
 It is rather clear today that OSI standards were seen as a weapon against TCP/IP protocols which, in addition to 
being mostly of US origin, could not, by definition, be considered as standards given that the IETF definitely did not 
have the status of a standards-making organization such as ISO or ITU. It is less clear who was at the origin of this war, 
namely European governments, Telecom Operators, emerging National Research and Education Networks, such as 
DFN in Germany,  influencing the EU or a few “visionaries” inside the EU, who knows!

universal protocol: that is, that the same network  layer protocol will be used between hosts on the same 
LAN, between hosts and routers, between routers in the same domain, and between routers in different 
domains. There are some advantages in defining separate "access" and "long-haul" protocols, and this is 
not precluded by the requirements. However, despite the few opportunities for major change of this sort 
within the Internet, the need for speed of development and low risk has led to the proposals being 
incremental, rather than radical, changes to well-proven existing technology”. This remark gives me the 
opportunity to say that the standard Ethernet frame size of 1500 bytes [320] has become the 
plague of the Internet because it greatly reduces the technical possibilities, such as recursive 
encapsulations, and also end-to-end performances over long paths. 
An excellent paper titled “IP next generation overview” [321] [322] was written by Bob 
Hinden, a well known Internet pioneer who started his career at BBN
229
 [323], and in which it is 
clear that the smooth migration and graceful coexistence between IPv4 and IPng was a constant 
preoccupation of all proposals; unfortunately, this has not quite succeeded because the two 
protocols cannot easily coexist thus greatly complicating the migration process. 
Finally, “The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol” 
 
RFC 1752 [324] by S. 
Bradner came out in January 1995: “This proposal represents a synthesis of multiple IETF efforts with 
much of the basic protocol coming from the SIPP effort, the auto configuration and transition portions 
influenced by TUBA, the addressing structure is based on the CIDR work and the routing header evolving 
out of the SDRP deliberations.” In addition, RFC 1752 provides additional information about the 
reasons for not having selected TUBA: “There seems to be a profound disagreement within the TUBA 
community over the question of the ability of the IETF to modify the CLNP standards.  In our presentation 
in Houston we said that we felt that “clone and run" was a legitimate process.  This is also what the IAB 
proposed in IP version 7
 
[325]". The TUBA community has not reached consensus that this view is 
reasonable.  While many, including a number of the CLNP document authors, are adamant that this is not 
an issue and the IETF can make modifications to the base standards, many others are just as adamant that 
the standards can only be changed through the ISO standards process.  Since the overwhelming feeling 
within the IETF is that the IETF must own the standards on which it is basing its future, this disagreement 
within the TUBA community was disquieting. 
So, the question of the ownership of the ISO CLNS protocols appears to have been one of 
strongest arguments against TUBA. 
Fortunately or unfortunately
230
, CIDR
231
 [326], RFC 1517 [327], was approved in September 
1993 and was swiftly fitted into BGP thus postponing the IPv4 transition for at least two decades, 
but hopefully not forever! In addition, ad-hoc solutions have been deployed to connect residential 
customers e.g., NAT
232
 [328] and ALG
233
 [329]. Firewalls 
 
[330] were also deployed to protect 
against attacks of various sorts, i.e. DOS [331], DDOS
234
. The IETF superbly ignored these 
developments sticking to its “end-to-end and address transparency” paradigm according to which 
security must be dealt with in the end hosts through IPSEC 
 
[332].  
TUBA that was authored by DEC
235
 had many supporters, in particular in Europe, and was 
actually one of the best proposals, basically replacing IP by CLNP and thus solving the potential 
shortage of IP4 addresses; unfortunately, it was rejected.

While IPv4 was definitely saved by CIDR and NATs and is still alive in 2012, despite the fact 
that all the remaining available address space has now been distributed by IANA
236
 [333] to the 
RIRs
237
 [334], is the IPv4 based Internet  in a lasting and healthy shape?  
I agree with Brian Carpenter that the definite answer is not quite! Indeed, some of the major 
ISPs
238
 have already started to deploy "carrier grade” NATs, in effect NATs over residential 
customers NATs, which  are bound to cause some additional disruptions, as various major 
applications simply fail across double NATs. “So we get the phenomenon of everything, including 
real-time streaming, running over HTTP”.  
Whereas CIDR has definitely been a very good thing, NATs have also been very useful but 
have added a lot of complexity and have now clearly reached their limits in the sense that they 
cannot be used as a substitute for large scale deployment of IPv6, however, will this really happen 
anytime soon if an IPv4 address trading market starts to develop? 
Both CIDR and NATs definitely delayed the much needed transition to IPv6 which has now 
become a potential operational nightmare whereas, back in 1993 this transition would have been 
undoubtedly far much easier as this was only the start of the commercial Internet.   
As pointed out by Paul Bryant: “The key issue is that a transition from IP4 must be more or less 
invisible to the user. With some millions of IP4 users you cannot expect non-technical users to need to have 
to do anything. Currently the UK
239
 is phasing out the analogue TV service. This has involved ensuring that 
all new TV sets could use analogue and digital for 3 or so years, production of digital boxes to convert 
existing TV and a large publicity campaign. This has gone well and shows that a transition of the 
underlying protocols is possible but needs a lot of planning.” 
8 European Networking Organisations 
8.1 The establishment of RIPE and the RIPE NCC 
CERN, under the impulsion of François Fluckiger, played a major role in the formation of 
RIPE and it is little known that the founding meeting actually took place at CERN in 
December 1988 with only six participants: Rob Blokzijl from Nikhef (NL), Mats Brunell from 
SICS
240
 [335], Daniel Karrenberg from EUnet (NL), Enzo Valente from INFN (IT), François 
Fluckiger and myself from CERN. The first RIPE meeting took place in June 1989 in Amsterdam 
shortly before the installation of the first international 2Mb/s circuit in Europe between CERN 
and Bologna in July 1989, funded by INFN, just in time for the startup of LEP [336], thus closing 
the first European Internet backbone, from Stockholm (KTH) to Bologna (CNAF) through 
Amsterdam (CWI) and Geneva (CERN). The minutes of the first RIPE meetings can be retrieved 
from the RIPE archives, e.g. those of RIPE-1 [337] and RIPE-2 [338]. Although SURFnet [339] 
was more pro-X.25 than pro-IP initially pragmatism prevailed and an agreement was soon found 
with both EUnet (CWI) and RIPE. In particular, the Ebone study, that had a major impact on the 
emergence of the European Internet, was funded by SURFnet.

The name Ebone was coined by 
Bernard Stockman (KTH) as a joke 
alluding to the different circuit speeds 
in the USA and Europe, i.e. T1 versus 
E1 with Ebone really meaning “E1 
European backbone” in analogy with 
T-bone
241
 steaks [340], not T1 
networks, though the NSFnet 
backbone was initially a T1 based. The 
20
th
 anniversary of RIPE 
 
[341] was 
celebrated in May 2009 during the 
RIPE 58 meeting with many of the 
“pioneers” present. There were two 
reference presentations on the history 
of RIPE, “RIPE 20 years young” 
 
[342] by Rob Blokzijl and “How the 
name RIPE came about
”
 [343] by 
Daniel Karrenberg.

The year 1989 was definitely a very 
important date marking the real start 
of the European Internet; it has been a 
very enjoyable experience for many 
people, engineers and managers, as it 
was truly impossible, at that time, to 
predict that after more than 4 years of 
fierce struggles between the OSI and 
the Internet supporters, the wide 
adoption as well as the impressive 
growth of the Internet would follow so 
quickly afterwards.  
But was it so quick after all? 
Indeed, the RARE citadel only 
formally collapsed in October 1994, 
i.e. four and a half years after the 
Killarney meeting, through the merger 
with EARN and the establishment of TERENA

As already explained in the “Tribute to IBM and DEC” chapter above, it is not widely known 
that things would not have happened the same way without the significant seed funding brought 
by IBM in the framework of EASInet: 
1) By providing a T1 link between CERN (Geneva) and Cornell (USA), thus basically 
extending the newly born NSFNET T1 backbone to Europe 
2) By funding a 2Mb/s multiprotocol infrastructure between IBM supercomputer centers 
based on intelligent IDNX multiplexors, thus allowing the graceful coexistence of X25, 
DECNET, SNA and TCP/IP and providing a solid basis for building a genuine pan-
European TCP/IP backbone in collaboration with other organizations such as HEPNET 
and EUnet and, in the end, having an instrumental role allowing in the creation of Ebone.  
 
As already mentioned above, François Fluckiger clarified the role of CERN in the 
establishment of RIPE and the subsequent deployment of the European Internet in a CERN 
Computer Newsletter article [285]. 
8.2 RARE  
As pointed out repeatedly by Paolo Zanella, former head of DD Division at CERN, in the USA 
“rare” means not “well-done”!  
Was it just a “joke” or his assessment of the rather poor achievements of the RARE 
association? 
Excerpts from the TERENA’s 20 years birthday [345]:  « The association started its life as 
RARE (Réseaux Associés pour la Recherche Européenne) [346]. RARE was established under 
Dutch law on 13 June 1986 by Hans Rosenberg on behalf of the University of Utrecht and Klaus 
Ullmann on behalf of the DFN Association and Peter Linington was the first RARE Chairman. 
RARE changed its name to TERENA in 1994 when it merged with another organization, EARN, 
the European Academic and Research Network association.” 
RARE had a very ambitious work program supported by the EC with 8 working groups: 
1. WG1: Message Handling System (MHS) was led by Alf Hansen (Trondheim University) 
2. WG2: File transfer, access, and Management, 
3. WG3: Information service exchange of operation information 
4. WG4: Network operation and X.25 
5. WG5: Full screen services 
6. WG6: medium and high-speed communications 
7. WG7: Liaison with CEPT [347] 
8. WG8: Management of network application services 
Despite the outstanding work made by Alf Hansen, WG1 turned out to be a failure in the sense 
that X.400 was too immature and the X.400 UA
243
 were also too primitive, therefore it turned out 
to be impractical  to turn the pilot MHS project into production. 
WG2 (File transfer, aka GIFT) proved that gateway-based solutions were inherently unstable 
and not scalable, although this is somewhat contradicted by the following statement: 
                                                 
243

“Multiprotocol converter allowing file access, transfer and management and remote job entry across 
different network protocols is presented. The gateway architecture and the protocol conversion model, 
mediated by a file system, are described. It is shown that this approach greatly reduces the complexity of 
the multiprotocol conversion problem. Some examples of the gateway implementation are given. The 
gateway, entirely designed and developed by an international collaboration, has been in production since 
1985”. In practice, whereas the original idea was indeed excellent, the implementation proved to 
be very difficult, furthermore by the time it was nearly working it was no longer needed and 
therefore very little used. Also, new commercial solutions became available (e.g. DEC-IBM file 
transfers) but it is really the emergence 
of the new Internet world that basically 
eliminated the need for such a gateway, 
For reasons unknown to me, the WG6 
group had a bad reputation within 
RARE; however, in the end, it was the 
only Working Group that proposed a 
multi-protocol backbone, a vision later 
adopted by IBM, in the framework of 
their EASInet initiative, but also by 
NORDUnet and DANTE. 
With the support of the EC, RARE 
WG6 organized three very successful 
symposiums in Brussels on “High-speed 
Networking for Research in Europe” in 
1989, 1991, 1994. 
Back in 1988 I wrote a short report to 
RARE WG6 about the possible impact 
of NSFNET over European networking, 
in which I basically stated that “without 
any doubts NSFNET will have a 
profound impact on European Research 
and Education networking, however, as 
Unix was still little used in Europe and, 
as the main protocols used were those of 
DEC and IBM (i.e. DECNET, RSCS and 
SNA), a prerequisite was the availability 
of products allowing transparent 
encapsulation of these protocols over 
TCP/IP).”  
 
As proved later, the NJE protocols, 
much like the DECNET ones, could run 
over any network stack as they were 
application level protocols, e.g. Multinet 
[348], later fully integrated into the 
VAX/VMS operating system, allowed 
to running DECNET over TCP/IP and 
was one of the first products of this kind 
but many others quickly followed, e.g. 
VMNET (i.e. RSCS over TCP/IP). 
Figure 9 The torture of an OSI agnostic 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 68 
 
A rather disturbing aspect of RARE is that most of the information available, e.g. RARE 
Networkshop, needs to be bought from Elsevier’s International Journal of Computer and 
Telecommunications Networking: “Computer Networks and ISDN Systems” [349]; thus, 
following this tradition, the proceedings of the WG6 symposiums are only available from the 
above journal. The very informative presentation [350] made by Howard Davies (DANTE) 
during the 3
rd
 symposium, back in 1994, is actually one of the very few exceptions I am aware of! 
 
Nonetheless, a definite strength of RARE was to gather a set of high-level people, University 
professors and the like, but this was also one of their main weaknesses, as most of these 
“eminent” personalities had a “glaring” lack of experience with operational networks. The RARE 
WGs were more open
244
, nonetheless, as pointed out by Paul Bryant: “the experts were filtered 
through their NRENs, or at least in the UK, so only friends (friends of OSI) tended to be appointed to the 
RARE WGs. So that is why I never attended a RARE WG.” 
 
In order to preserve both proper intellectual level but, more importantly, right networking 
protocols culture, attendance at the RARE Networkshop was “controlled”, an effective way to 
exclude the EARN supporters and to keep RARE as a “closed club” of people sharing the same 
OSI “ideology”. However, some RARE members started to realize that OSI was late, e.g. Brian 
Carpenter gave a presentation at the Networkshop in Trieste (Italy) in May 1989 titled “Is OSI too 
late” [351] that received a standing ovation as well as that of Løvdal (University of Oslo and 
NORDUnet Technical coordinator) “Initial NORDUnet – the first multiprotocol network” [352].  
 
As related in the “Reactions to the NORDUnet plug” chapter of the “History of NORDUnet” 
[353] Einar Løvdal pointed out in his speech
 
that there were already a great number of 
unconnected IP networks in Europe and there was a need 
for European IP coordination. He also pointed out the 
scalability of the IP networks, as opposed to the OSI 
technology. “I still remember the tense and silent 
atmosphere during my talk, presenting these ideas to the 
several hundred European networkers plus guests from 
overseas; the enthusiastic applause from one half of the 
audience, the silence from the other half; and the intense 
discussions afterwards.”  
 
Indeed, a growing number of RARE members had 
finally understood that the ISO/OSI battle had been lost; however, it was impossible for the 
RARE leaders to admit this fact without undermining their own personal positions. In other 
words, the problem was between the RARE management, a not so small set of activists or 
evangelists and their  supporters, or rather followers, who were somehow cheated in the end, but 
definitely not with the RARE community, at large, that had a very wide overlap with the EARN 
community.  Nonetheless, the proposed NORDUnet Multiprotocol plug that was meant to be 
consensual turned out to be very controversial, if not provocative, as the Trieste Networkshop 
was meant to mark the start of the COSINE implementation phase, leading to European OSI 
transition and that much of the RARE funding was coming from the EC through the COSINE 
project. 
                                                 
244
 Having been both a member of RARE WG6 and a strong proponent of EARN it is difficult to pretend the contrary! 
However, my presence was due to the fact that, CERN presence was needed given our role as one of the main scientific 
data sources in the world, and Francois Fluckiger was too busy writing the FTAM COSINE specifications. 
Furthermore, I had good knowledge of ISDN having been tasked with writing a technology impact report  
Figure 10 Nordunet plug 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 69 
 
RARE quickly grasped the fact that the wide adoption, by the academic community at large, of 
operational services such as EARN/BITNET and EUnet was a real threat to their OSI strategy, 
therefore they tried their best to counter it using all their political links. 
Indeed, the political approach of RARE proved to be very effective because they had closed 
links with relevant ministries, European Commission officials, etc., therefore, as they had all the 
required budgets nothing could make them change their minds, hence they pushed the 
CCITT/ITU protocols, such as X.400, beyond reason, i.e. quoting Paul Bryant: “unfortunately for 
them, the funds did not go into the implementation of working protocols but only into talking about them.” 
In summary, many years were actually wasted in futile protocol battles, personal rivalries and 
power struggles! Nonetheless, RARE then DANTE very skillfully turned a technical failure into 
a political success. As stated by Paul Bryant “Many of the people ponding about in the politics of 
networking had never written a line of code in their lives. The EARN problem was that we had a lot of 
experts in IBM/NJE/SNA and not a lot on the other network technologies but we were light on the politics.” 
To close this chapter on a more positive note, most of the RARE activists, e.g., Alf Hansen, 
Jüergen Harms, James Hutton, Peter Kaufmann, Christian Michau, Bernhard Plattner, Jacques 
Prevost, Enzo Valente, Paul Van Binst, were actually nice individuals; however, the problem 
started when their strategy and associated implementation plans, which were often unrealistic 
being primarily motivated by ideological considerations, were questioned! 
8.3 Ebone 
Most of the information below has been kindly provided by Frode Greisen (ex-GTS/Ebone) 
and Kess Neggers (Surfnet): 
In 1991 Bernhard Stockman from KTH in Stockholm produced a table of all the International 
telecommunication links used by universities and research institutions in Europe. It was a long 
list with lots of duplicates between countries so people realized that there must be scope for 
rationalization. SURFnet then commissioned a report [354] and a proposed MoU
245
 [355] for 
organizations to cooperate in building and sharing a European Internet backbone. Several NRENs 
signed the MoU as well as some PNOs, EARN and 
IBM. The proposal was sent by Kees Neggers to the 
RARE CoA and RIPE on 19 September 1991 [356] 
and, unsurprisingly was not well received by RARE, 
despite the fact that the proposed “Ebone plug” had 
OSI-CLNS and Internet/IP interfaces as it was seen as 
a devious way to undermine Europanet, despite the 
fact that it had always been made very clear that 
Ebone 92 was only an interim solution and that the 
NRENs supporting it would move to the equivalent 
canonical EC funded multiprotocol backbone. 
The 1
st
 Ebone consortium meeting took place at 
CERN on the occasion of the 10
th
 RIPE meeting in 
September 1991 [357] [358]. A key statement of this 
meeting was the agreement that “By  linking the IXI and  Ebone  92 backbones (via an  EBS router)  the 
connectivity for IP can be readily extended to  the IXI connected  networks. Thus all IXI users can join 
Ebone 92 and benefit from the managed IP service.” The signatories of the Ebone MoU agreed to pool 
                                                 
245
 Memorandum of Understanding

existing international links for joint use, and it elected a management group with Kees Neggers as 
chairman and with technical groups for operations and development. The 2
nd
 Ebone consortium 
meeting took place in Amsterdam in October 1991 [359] and dealt mainly with organizational 
matters: “1) The RARE  offer to  undertake the clearing house function  previously offered by SURFnet 
was accepted. 2) The  Ebone  Action Team  (EAT)  will prepare and implement  the  initial resilient  kernel 
network. The initial EAT members were confirmed
246
.  A draft paper "Technical Aspects of an EBS system" 
has been  prepared by Bernhard Stockman, Peter Lothberg and Juha Heinänen in preparation for the EAT 
activities.3) A  Management  Committee  (EMC)  is  to  be  formed  to  coordinate  the activities  for  the  
execution  of  the MoU and external  liaison.  The following persons
247
 indicated their willingness to assist 
in these tasks:    This interim team will establish the EMC and coordinate further the Ebone 92 formation 
activities; the actual membership of the EMC will be determined at the end of November to conform to the 
management principles as laid down in the MoU.”  
Last but not least, the formal agreement of IBM that welcomed the Ebone 92 initiative and the 
use of the EASInet lines was sent by Harry Casper to Kees Neggers in December 1991 [360]. As 
reported in the minutes of 25
th
 RARE CoA meeting in February 1993 under the heading “EBONE 
IN 1993” [361]:  “The Ebone 92 backbone continues in 1993. At the Ebone consortium meeting on Feb. 3 
in Luxembourg the partners finalized the budget, decided on an upgrade of the backbone and set up the 
organization to operate Ebone in 1993.  Ebone's long term strategy was confirmed to concentrate in the 
future on providing a neutral interconnect for all networks, while it is assumed that provision of backbone 
services will be offered by one or more (competing) providers in the longer run. Until such offers are 
forthcoming, Ebone will take care of its partners' needs in this area too. The RARE Secretariat will 
continue to provide administrative services and act as a clearing house.”  
 In September 1992 the initial IP backbone with 256 kbps links was completed and in 
operation. Frode Greisen was appointed general manager and Peter Löthberg was the de facto 
architect of Ebone during its lifetime. A cost-sharing mechanism was set up where all members 
paid proportionally for access to the network according to their access bandwidth, and members 
were refunded for the cost of the links and other resources that they provided to the network 
The network was upgraded to 512 Kb/s in 1993, to 2 Mb/s in 1994, to 34 Mb/s in 1996, to 155 
Mb/s in 1998 and to 2.5 Gb/s in 1999. Getting international leased lines was extremely difficult, 
expensive and slow at the time. For instance, when Ebone ordered a 34 Mbps line to Paris in 1995 
they were told by France Telecom that such a product would not be provided at the time, and 
indeed that it was unlikely ever to be offered. Only a competitive line supplier eventually 
installed high speed links to Paris. The total access volume offered to members increased from 4 
Mb/s in 1992 to 235 Mb/s in 1999, and since the network was basically full, except in short 
periods after upgrades, one can infer that traffic increased by a factor of  60 over seven years, i.e. 
a doubling every fourteen months. This is closer to Moore’s law than to the doubling of traffic 
every three months  reported in the US by Mike O’Dell of UUnet, but then most of the time 
Ebone growth was capacity constrained, not demand constrained. 
Initial Ebone members were NRENs including NORDUnet, SURFnet, RENATER and 
ACOnet, a few research institutions as well commercial ISPs and PNOs, around fifteen in total. 
Over the years this increased to around 100 customers in 1999 and over this period nearly all 
European incumbent PTTs were Ebone customers for some period as they joined the rush to build 
Internet offerings to their customers.

In 1996 the Ebone consortium transformed itself into the Ebone Association which again set up 
a wholly owned company Ebone Inc. A/S in Denmark. Consortium members became members of 
the association as well as customers of the company. 
In 1999 the Ebone Association sold Ebone Inc. to GTS, and Ebone members shared the 
proceeds and subsequently dissolved the Association. 
The Ebone network and brand continued for some years, until GTS was sold to KPNQWEST 
early in 2002. However, in summer 2002 KPNQWEST went bankrupt following a glut of 
international fiber transmission capacity and fierce price competition in both data and telephony 
services. 
As Ebone was in direct competition with Europanet and as its operating mode did not exactly 
follow DANTE’s train of thoughts, DANTE was doing its best to promote their network 
management concepts. In that respect the following table extracted from “DANTE in Print” (DIP 
#6, 1993)” [362] is rather illuminating of the propaganda style of DANTE. So, one learns that, 
unlike Ebone, Europanet had predictable behavior, and defined QoS!

8.4 TERENA, the Merging of EARN and RARE 
8.4.1 “Data Networking for the European Academic and Research Community: Is it 
important?” 
It is actually Paul Bryant who reminded me about the existence of this very informative and 
very relevant report [365] that was published in “Electronic Networking Research Application 
and Policy” in June 1992 but was derived from an internal CN division report in October 1991, 
i.e. right after the Killarney meeting and only a few months after the EASInet connection between 
CERN and NSFnet was established. 
This report undoubtedly had some impact on European Networking policy, which is why large 
excerpts are reproduced here, although not exactly what its author
248
, the late David Williams 
(CERN), had hoped for, namely the creation of a focused European Network Agency in charge of 
European Academic and Research Networks!  
The original report was written in the utmost secrecy behind the back of two deeply involved 
persons in the subject matter, namely Francois Fluckiger, deputy CS group leader, and myself in 
charge of External networking and CERN’s representative to the EARN Board, which was a bit 
weird   
Neither BETEL (1993), nor DANTE (1993) and TERENA (October 1994) had been launched 
The report makes strong criticisms of the RACE program which, in my view, are due to sheer 
ignorance
249
 of the authors, however, the intent is clear namely make “better” use of the 250 
MUSD yearly funding (i.e. future DANTE’s “EU funding cannibalization” syndrome) and is 
basically a plea to bring the European Scientific community at the same level as the US, also 
taking into account the lack of involvement the European industry and therefore its consequences. 
There is a good survey of the US and Pacific, that was even well behind Europe with respect to 
US connectivity 64 Kb/s, situations, also mentioning the 45Mb/s NSFnet backbone plans and a 
reasonably objective survey of the European situation with mentions of EARN, EUnet, 
NORDUnet, RARE, COSINE (IXI) and last the emerging
250
  European Internet, coordinated by 
RIPE, under the RARE umbrella as a new WG
251
. Although, there is a mention of IBM’s EASInet 
initiative, as well as its substantial influence on the emerging, though “anarchical
252
”, European 
Internet, with the positive comment that “It is encouraging that the supplier of many of Europe’s 
biggest scientific computers has agreed to sponsor a European network based on open protocols (TCP/IP) 
rather than on the vendor’s proprietary protocols
253
.”, there is no explicit mention of the EASInet 1.5 
Mb/s (T1) link between CERN and NSFnet which is somewhat strange to say the least as this was 
really the “coup de grace” to RARE’s OSI strategy, however, CERN was indeed rather reluctant 
to “bring the cat among the pigeons”! Actually, this is not really strange given that the CERN 
management, including some influential individuals like David Foster, had a very negative 
reaction to IBM’s proposal to terminate the T1 link at CERN despite the repeated attempts of 
                                                 
248
 Although listed as a co-author Brian Carpenter, told me in a private message that he was asked to review this paper 
but did not actively participate in its writing 
249

 Editor’s note: This is factually wrong as RIPE was fully independent from RARE, however, the RIPE-NCC was 
not. For further details please refer to paragraph 6.4.  
252
 i.e. not officially planned and relying on very informal management techniques, so what was the problem as it 
worked very well in practice thanks to a 1st class engineering team? 
253
 When IBM announced its EASInet initiative there was deep suspicion in some circles that it would use it to promote 
SNA, which was completely preposterous given the EARN/BITNET history, furthermore the T1 link to NSFnet was, 
by definition, a pure Internet circuit!  
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 73 
Herb Budd who rightly saw CERN as the natural European end-point of this “historical” 
connection. Indeed, CERN being afraid to be perceived as the “traitor” to the sacred cause of 
OSI, proposed to IBM to terminate this link to IN2P3 in Lyon which IBM reluctantly had to agree 
to.  
Both Francois Fluckiger and I were devastated, how anyone could pass up such an opportunity!  
I had no leverage; finally, Francois found the right words paraphrasing Marx “the history never 
returns the same dishes twice
254”, therefore it is totally unrealistic to imagine that this circuit will be moved 
back to CERN when political circumstances are more favorable” and so the CERN management 
finally, though reluctantly, agreed at the very last minute to accept what they initially saw as a 
“poisoned” gift that could only weaken their position in the European networking arena by 
helping the penetration of Internet in Europe at the expense of OSI!  
Back to the “Is it important?” report, the summary of chapter 4 “The situation in Europe” is 
quite good “A pale copy of US, data networking seems to be planned in Europe on a country-by-country 
basis, and the pan-European strategy and infrastructure is missing. The authors are convinced that Europe 
is in the process of abandoning, almost by default, a vital segment of tomorrow’s commercial and 
industrial base to our competitors.” 
Chapter 4 goes on with section 4.2 “Plans” (points 1-2) and 4.3 “Barriers to Progress” (points 
3-2) 
1. The plans for the 2Mb/s EMPP255, the 64 Kb/s IXI successor, are well advanced256 and 
that there is also a consortium known as Ebone 92 that has been created to consolidate 
the existing European Internet, but none of its international lines
257
 are as fast as 
2Mb/s.  
2. The RARE Operational Unit (proposed in 1991, is expected to become operational in 
1992, but plans unclear (as proved since it was decided to create DANTE Ltd instead)). 
3.  “As a community, European researchers and academics have failed to convince Europe’s 
politicians, civil servants, industrialists, and carriers, that data networking is important and 
that everyone should collaborate to improve the European infrastructure.” 
4. ONP258 as well as plans of existing PTTs, Cable and Wireless and various US 
companies to cover the whole European market are mentioned. 
5. Regarding leased lines tariffs, the comparison between US and Europe shows a factor 
from 3 to 10. 
6. Long paragraph on Europe’s conservative approach to telecommunications that is 
dominated by Alcatel, Ericsson, and Siemens that are more focused on voice than data 
as also observed by Paul Bryant. 
7. Criticism of RACE program 250MUSD (200M ECU259) that is too much focused 
towards the industry and not enough (i.e. not at all until BETEL) on the academic and 
research community.

8. On Protocol issues: “Unfortunately, OSI products have taken much longer to arrive than 
expected, and they still offer limited functionality and performance. Furthermore, products 
based on another set of Open Networking protocols, the Internet TCP/IP suite, have become 
widely available on computers and workstations from all vendors. So while OSI undoubtedly 
will still have an important role to play, it is no longer realistic
260
 to use it as the sole basis
261
 
for Europe’s data networking strategy”. Users need to confirm their commitment to non-
proprietary Open Networking and to plan the phase-out, as quickly as possible, of 
proprietary protocols. 
9. Under the heading “No fully European scientific computing companies”, there is a mention 
of Carlo Rubbia’s
262
 HPCC
263
 [366] report [368] commissioned by the EEC that 
suggested to “developing HPCC in the emerging socio-economic and industrial context and 
proposed an investment program of ECU 5 billion over a period of ten years.” Strangely 
enough, this report that is widely referenced by a related 1994 OECD report [369] 
titled “National R&D Programs for new Computer-Communications Networks and 
Applications” as “The most prominent effort towards a comprehensive European program for 
HPCC” cannot be found online. Not even at CERN! 
10. Lack of collaboration as well as lack of focus are rightly emphasized 
Section 4.4 “What happens if we do nothing?” concludes chapter 4 
“The authors are convinced that European data networking will remain underdeveloped in the short 
term and will then be quickly colonized by companies based in the USA who have understood the 
development needed in this market. Put bluntly, we will have abandoned European data networking to a 
combination of American computing and networking companies.” 
Chapter 5 “Recommendations and conclusions” is very interesting; 
1. ECFRN
264
 proposal for Senior Officials Group 
2. The necessity to give a stronger emphasis to the service needs of academic and research 
users, rather than to the choice of particular protocols. These services should be based on non-
proprietary Open Networking protocols including TCP/IP and OSI (interesting to note that 
TCP/IP comes out first, however, the statement also implies that OSI is not dead, probably 
because of DECNET phase V and CLNP? 
3. Build same kind of collaboration in the field of data networking as in the USA involving 
government, industry, the common carriers, and the academic and research community.   
4. Hope to see more liberal regulations and competitive international carriers as soon as 
possible. 
5. The multi-service operational unit originally proposed by RARE should be set up with 
the goals of satisfying all users and supporting all open protocols. 
6. Merging of EARN and RARE in order to radically improve the European focus on 
research networking. 
7. RARE, or the merged EARN/RARE should concentrate on long-term planning and 
policy issues and leave day-to-day matters to the operating agency.

8. In the medium term (2-3 years) we would like to see the creation of a European Treaty 
Organisation, or a legally simpler NGO
265
, as an agency to plan and oversee the operation of 
Europe’s data networking infrastructure
266
…. It should keep its own staff members at a low level 
and aim to use commercial services as soon as the requirements for these services are clearly 
understood, but not before. 
8.4.2 TERENA 
According to DANTE [370] “DANTE's sister organization is TERENA [371]. TERENA is the 
Trans-European Research and Education Networking Association, and is based in Amsterdam in 
“The Netherlands”. TERENA carries out technical activities and provides a platform for 
discussion to encourage the development of a high-quality computer networking infrastructure 
for the European research community. The activities of DANTE and TERENA are separate but 
complementary, and our two organizations cooperate together in many activities. TERENA is the 
successor organization to RARE, which founded DANTE.”  
I am quoting the above example as it is the “typical” DANTE way of “misinforming” people 
by deliberately omitting the names of people and/or organizations for which they have a profound 
dislike, in this case EARN. 
For example, “consensus”, as exemplified in the excellent TERENA booklet [372] “20 years 
of collaboration in research networking 1986-2006” is a very nice thing: “There has definitely 
not always been  total agreement on the exact path to take at any point in time, but these 
differences of opinion have proved fruitful, ensuring in-depth deliberations and discussions”.  
Of course, TERENA, as a very successful consensus-building association of NRENs could not 
write anything else and the above phrasing is a very nice euphemism hiding as much as possible 
the ferocity as well as the intensity of the underground battle between the supporters of 
conflicting networking models and protocols. A battle which is actually not completely over still! 
Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that this truly “historical” event in 2006 that is described as 
the 20
th
 anniversary of RARE, 
 
which is factually incorrect as both the EARN and RARE 
associations disappeared in October 1994, as a result of their merger, to become TERENA. So, it 
should have been the 12th anniversary of TERENA or the combined anniversaries of EARN (22 
years) and RARE (20 years) but not just the anniversary of RARE alone, especially given the 
counter-productive role of the RARE association during its first 10 years of existence.  
Indeed, one of the main rationale of RARE was to fight the EARN association by all possible 
means so, taking the RARE viewpoint for once, EARN had at least one virtue, that of having 
accelerated the creation of RARE  
One of the major difference between RARE and other networking associations like, e.g.,  
EARN, BITNET, EUnet and UUNET, was the clear orientation of the latter towards providing 
operational services to their users using proven technologies.  
In contrast, RARE had a very strong political agenda and was using all possible ways to force 
what they believed to be the right technical solution for Europe in the interest of both the 
European industry and the technical independence of Europe against the dreaded US  Internet 
protocols (i.e. TCP/IP).  
                                                 
265
 Non-Governmental Organisation 
266
 Reminiscent of the European Grid Initiative (EGI), where the hidden agenda was to base it at CERN and be driven 
by CERN. For the same reasons that CERN has too many enemies in the closed world of national networks but also 
that CERN must concentrate on its primary mission, both proposals were rejected although implemented in different 
manners, namely; DANTE a limited company based in Cambridge (UK) and EGI based in Amsterdam. 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 76 
Unfortunately, the main RARE technical weapons, namely X.400, X.500 and the OSI protocol 
suite were kind of “work in progress” as implementations were lacking, scalability and resiliency 
were yet to be proven. In other words, the solutions proposed by RARE were political rather than 
technical solutions, whereas the European academic and research community absolutely needed 
operational networks, in order to facilitate worldwide collaborations and exchange of ideas.  
It is rather sad to observe, that the European networking history bears many similarities with 
the way in which Europe reacted to recent crisis
267
 namely, national interests prevailing over 
general interest, lack of institutional EU leadership, etc. 
In that respect, the story of the TERENA voting rights is rather instructive!  Indeed, even 
though the RARE politicians had very carefully devised the new TERENA bylaws such that the 
“big countries”, also dubbed “the gang of four” could have the majority of the new TERENA 
organization voting rights without contributing the matching part of the budget
268
, things 
happened differently during the TERENA founding meeting because one of the pro-RARE 
delegates who held several votes left the meeting just before the election of the new TERENA 
board, thus allowing Frode Greisen to be elected with a majority of only one vote!  
So, was the small amount of money saved in twisting the voting rights really worth losing the 
election and thus creating additional chaos and mistrust? 
Needless to say, Frode Greisen as well as the newly elected TERENA Executive Committee 
had a very difficult year as their investiture was considered by the former RARE people as an 
imposture. After one chaotic year, Frode Greisen was forced to resign and was succeeded by 
Stefano Trumpy (CNR) and then David Williams (CERN).  
It is actually thanks to David Williams during his four year presidency that the antagonism 
between DANTE and TERENA slowly evolved into a fruitful and mutually beneficial 
relationship, leading to the joint SERENATE [373] [374] study but also to the TERENA 
compendium of European NRENs [375]. 
Thanks to its secretary general, Karel Vietsch, TERENA has now become a unanimously 
respected networking association that is the organizer of a very high quality annual networking 
conference
269
, as well as many ad-hoc working groups, workshops and training courses. 
Therefore, all is well that ends well. 
8.5 DANTE  
I am well aware that some of my comments on RARE and DANTE are pretty harsh and may 
therefore be seen as unnecessarily aggressive, however, since the purposes of this  article are 
mainly historical, I think these comments reflect quite well the atmosphere and the conflicts that 
have occurred within the European NREN community during the last 25, or so, years; however, I 
have to agree that things have improved slowly but slowly since then, although they are still far 
from being perfect as both the Board of DANTE and the GEANT [376] consortium are still 
largely driven by politics. 
Although RARE considered creating an Operational Unit, they finally opted for the creation of 
DANTE, a commercial company based in Cambridge (UK), in 1993.

8.5.1 The DANTE and NREN monopoly question 
European NRENs and DANTE share the same vision, actually a dogma, about single national 
as well as single pan-European backbone, providing both accesses to other R&E institutes as well 
as to the commercial Internet. In practice, the creation of monopolies, with initially worthwhile 
objectives but bearing the risks inherent to any monopolistic organization, namely: lack of 
interest for captive users, obsession of its own survival, possibly "hidden agenda" e.g. bias 
towards specific protocols through differentiated charging, etc.  
NLR [377] who was the precursor of a US-wide dark fiber based networking infrastructure 
failed several times to merge with Internet2 [378] and, as far as I am aware of, this did not lead to 
a catastrophic situation, on the contrary it even had the positive effect of spurring Internet2 as 
NLR was from the very beginning more innovative, technically speaking. 
To my knowledge, this is the first time that the near-universal dogma that an NREN is a 
natural monopoly is seriously questioned; and it is also interesting to note that it has rather been 
beneficial to the US academic and research user community, as far as I can judge. 
The comments above are not intended to be negative as I have been very impressed by the 
spectacular progress achieved by both DANTE and the European NRENs in building the 
successive generations of pan-European and National networking infrastructures, thanks to the 
continued support of both the EC and the National governments. However, I believe that a more 
network research oriented approach might have been more appropriate than just mimicking the 
Telecom Operators, using “off the shelf” equipment; indeed, while I fully appreciate the political 
challenges in carrying out such an ambitious undertaking, I am rather disappointed by the more 
technical aspects. Therefore, I am very concerned that these monopolies, especially that of 
DANTE, could last much longer than necessary as very few people seem to question their very 
existence! 
In this sense, I found the following excerpts from a recent report on e-infrastructures [379] 
commissioned by the EC and titled e-Research 2020: “The Role of e-Infrastructures in the 
Creation of Global Virtual Research Communities” very illuminating: 
"This last point also highlights two interconnected and overlooked feature of infrastructures. Firstly, 
they need to be standardized, and secondly, they need to be monopolies. Traditional infrastructures are 
monopolies, and attempts to break up monopolies have shown that this is a nearly impossible task. It is also 
worth noting that there is a tension in this monopolistic nature: innovation is thought to rely on 
competition, which monopolies eliminate or quash. On the other hand, standards that monopolies provide 
are in some cases an essential precondition for advancing knowledge. This means that oftentimes, it may be 
useful if there is only a single infrastructure without rivals or parallel efforts." 
Whereas I fully agree that monopolies are not necessarily bad, e.g. the French TGV [380] or 
the EDF [381] are very interesting success stories in that respect, going as far as stating that 
standards that monopolies provide “are in some cases a pre-condition for advancing knowledge 
and that oftentimes, it may be useful if there is only a single infrastructure without rivals or 
parallel efforts” is rather surprising, especially considering the rather average technical 
achievements of most European NRENs, in general, and DANTE, in particular! 
What is even more amazing is that DANTE apparently managed to convince the EC that their 
anti-competitive approach was the only practical way to proceed, which was definitely “true” 
before the Telecom deregulation of 1998 but is highly questionable, to say the least, more than 10 
years afterwards!  
 
However, this is not to say that seed-funding is not the right way to proceed when local funding 
sources are either  very limited or even non-existent, in order  to allow sufficient time for the 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 78 
beneficiaries to organize themselves; for example, the connections to non-EC countries should 
definitely be applauded, e.g. ALICE [382], CAREN [383], EUMEDCONNECT
 
 [384], TEIN 
[385] [386] and more recently Africa-Connect
270
 [387]. More precisely, it is the EC and not 
DANTE that must be commended for these excellent, much needed, initiatives.  
 
Whereas, the systematic involvement of DANTE is highly debatable, the connection of these 
new countries/regions to GEANT directly or indirectly is excellent. What about separate call for 
proposals for external connections to GEANT PoPs
271
 or even better to the main European 
IXPs272 [388], open to DANTE, NRENs, Telecom Operators and other interested parties, 
instead? 
 
Another important issue related to the DANTE monopoly over the pan-European backbone is 
whether DANTE would be economically viable, compared to commercial Internet providers, 
without the EC subsidies. 
 
Unfortunately, given the fierce competition between Telecom operators on many routes, e.g. 
most of Western Europe and Transatlantic, the answer is most likely to be negative
273
 for a 
number of reasons:  
1. DANTE’s costs are essentially fixed during the duration of the EC project, usually 3 
years, whereas the Telecom market is highly dynamic and competitive, 
2. Massive use of sub-contracting, 
3. High overhead costs inherent to EC projects. 
 
While sub-contracting is a very effective way to leave operational responsibilities to others 
and, if/when things go wrong, put the blame on them, this zero-risk approach is not only 
expensive but also very inefficient and it is definitely not the right way to leapfrog US networking 
initiatives such as GENI. The FEDERICA [389] project (a 2.5 year project with a 3.7 M€ EC 
contribution, 5.2 M€ budget, 20 partners, 461 Person Months) is very instructive in that respect, 
as hardly anybody used that infrastructure to the extent that the project was not even renewed by 
the EC, which is rather rare!  
 
DANTE’s strategy always was to grasp all available EC funding, under the premise that they 
were the only organization capable of satisfying the user needs at the smallest possible costs, 
whereas the only thing that really mattered to them, as well as to their NREN masters, was to 
fully control and manage pan-European networks, be they “research networks” or “networks for 
research
274
”.This greedy strategy proved to be a very effective way to prevent potential 
“competitor projects” to break into their “walled” garden, despite the fact that they could not 
prevent some EC projects like, e.g., BETEL and/or DataTAG from being funded! 
 
Of course, I am fully aware that there is no single answer and that, in some parts of Europe, 
competition is much less developed than in others; however, perpetuating a model that is unlikely

the African partners in the project.

to be self-sustained in the long term is, I believe, a fundamental mistake, in addition to being a 
potential waste of public money.  
 
8.5.2 Political and technical assessment  
Both RARE and DANTE share an amazing series of political successes and mixed technical 
achievements that are very likely due to their ideological biases as well as their thirst for power. 
Regarding their political achievements they undoubtedly deserve the top marks, regarding their 
technical achievements they deserve average marks and regarding the price/performance ratio 
they probably deserve poor marks as, without the EC subsidies DANTE’s prices would probably 
be well above the commercial market prices; in addition their cost sharing model is highly 
questionable!  
The sad reality is that the average technical results of DANTE are not due to the lack of 
competence of their technical staff but to the fact that each and every technical decision is taken, 
independently of its soundness, according the political agenda of DANTE.  
For example, during many years and for purely political reasons, DANTE carefully avoided 
borrowing some of the successful building principles of Ebone, e.g., having PoPs at the major 
IXPs, in order to facilitate peering with commercial ISPs, which was something rather obvious to 
do, at least for the technical experts! Interestingly enough, DFN was also not present at the DE-
CIX [390] for many years; could there be a correlation between these very similar behaviors? 
This sheer fact, together with many others, explain why  I have little consideration for 
DANTE’s management and why I am also appalled by the very high costs resulting from the 
“pyramidal” structure of contractors, sub-contractors as well as the lack of proper consultation 
with their end users
275
. 
Although this assessment may look too harsh, I believe that almost anybody else, without such 
a loaded, often hidden, political agenda, would have done a much better job! 
However, DANTE is slowly
276
 learning from its own technical mistakes, for example having 
PoPs in Telecom supplier premises, PoPs in independent locations, e.g., the Telehouse PoP in 
New-York city, but also the LDCOM [391] PoP at the Geneva airport
277
, as they finally, although 
very reluctantly, agreed to the obvious, i.e. having PoPs in University premises and/or near the 
main data sources, e.g. CERN. Nonetheless, as strange as it may look, the GEANT PoP at CERN 
does not participate in the CIXP [392], the local Internet Exchange Point in Geneva for weird 
reasons that the average GEANT user cannot easily grasp but which can be easily understood
278
! 
As this abnormal situation could not continue forever, a revolution happened in September 2010 
when “DANTE Ltd / GEANT became operational at the DE-CIX.”, i.e. 15 years or so after the 
start of TEN-34, a most impressive achievement indeed! 
                                                 
275
 The problem with DANTE, but also some NRENs like RENATER, is that they have few users in the conventional 
sense but National or Regional network organizations; nonetheless they could try to organize Internet2 like meetings. 
276
 10 years or so only! 
277
 The LDCOM PoP at Geneva airport was specially created for DANTE, in order to avoid being located at CERN, 
and so was very expensive to the extent that nobody else ever used it, especially as the value of an exchange point is 
proportional to the number of ISPs present, but this is not a valid argument for DANTE as the last thing they want is to 
peer with commercial ISPs in order to make access to GEANT difficult unless you are directly connected! 
278
 In fact DANTE’s reasoning is that if they open GEANT to commercial ISPs by peering with them at the major IXPs 
there is a risk that good connectivity with GEANT will no longer require direct connection to GEANT, in other words 
the end of the  DANTE world  
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 80 
The question about the (lack of) presence of GEANT at major IXPs is not insignificant as, if 
DANTE was playing by the “rules of the game”, i.e. peering with major ISPS, a significant part 
of the commercial Internet traffic would be free and also high quality being, by definition, not 
transit traffic. Of course, this would not eliminate the need to purchase Internet transit through at 
least two major ISPs but could be a significant cost reduction factor to the DANTE community, at 
large, including the NRENs that take care of their own commercial Internet connectivity.  
 
To conclude, DANTE must be seen as an indisputable success in terms of bringing NRENs 
together while also gaining the trust of the EC, therefore substantial amount of funding, and, last 
but not least, building a European-wide monopoly backbone interconnecting most European 
National Research and Education Networks with an impressive number of connections to other 
NRENs worldwide; however, as correctly stated by Peter Villemoes, one must not forget that the 
first usable DANTE backbone was TEN-34 in 1997, i.e. 7 years after IXI, which is not really 
very impressive! 
8.6 ERCIM 
ERCIM [393], the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics remains a 
“mystery” to me as its visible achievements have been largely invisible outside its own 
community, apart from being the European host of the W3C consortium [394]; however, it 
appears to be a much respected organization. 
9 The pre-1998 European PTT monopoly regime and the emergence 
of new monopolies in the academic and research community 
Besides the historical aspects that make up the bulk of this article and were initially the main 
motivation for writing it, a secondary goal is to take a critical eye at the new monopolies that have 
solidly established themselves in the European academic and research community as the sole 
Internet connectivity suppliers. Indeed, it is rather strange to observe that the old PTT monopoly 
has been replaced in the academic and research world by new monopolies dubbed NREN, at the 
national level, and DANTE/GEANT, at the pan-European level. While there was unanimity that 
the old PTT monopoly was a bad thing, hence the 98/10/EC directive in 1998 about “Open 
Network Provision” (ONP) [395], that is usually referred to as “Telecom deregulation” instead of 
“Telecom liberalization”, nobody seems to be seriously worried by the new monopoly situation 
in, admittedly, a small market segment, i.e. that of research and education networks. 
While it is undisputable that, in the early days of the Internet, it was the academic and research 
community that led the development of new Internet protocols and services (e.g., the World Wide 
Web that was started at CERN in 1992) and that the NRENs, being well ahead of commercial 
ISPs, also played a major role in the creation of the modern Internet. Therefore, the emergence of 
NRENs and DANTE  have not only been natural but also essential steps to providing state of the 
art Internet infrastructures to the academic and research community, that the emerging 
commercial Internet Operators were then unable to provide. 
However, it is also a fact that things have changed considerably since the mid-1990s, indeed, 
thanks to healthy competition between ISPs, high bandwidth as well as good quality of service 
are now available at very aggressive prices; hence it is amazing that the NREN/DANTE 
monopoly model is not subject to closer scrutiny and it is quite legitimate to wonder whether this, 
over 20 years old, model is still the best suited one, what are its mid-to-long term prospects and 
whether it should not start to evolve, both architecturally and organizationally? In particular, is 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 81 
there still a need for continued public subsidies
279
 beyond 2013 at the level of those of the 2009-
2013 periods, i.e. €93 million for GEANT3 [396] for what has mostly become commodity 
services and where fierce competition between Telecom operators continues to drive the prices 
down?  
 Indeed, an inversion of DANTE’s “economy of scale” model
280
 may well happen given the 
steady decrease of the commercial Internet prices that DANTE is unable to reflect, having mostly 
become its own supplier through its long-term lease of dark fibers. Hence, unlike conventional 
TELCOs that have to deal with double-digits growing demand, DANTE’s captive market does 
not exhibit the same growth profile, in other words it is more or less stagnating; therefore, I fail to 
see how DANTE could maximize the smart investment they made by leasing dark fibers, unless 
they expand their business role beyond the academic and research community thus become a 
genuine TELCO, which they have already been for many years for the benefits of the European 
NRENs? This was indeed what Ebone did in the 1990 years, allowing it to become the fastest 
International network in Europe in terms of offered bandwidth. 
 
DANTE’s expertise in the area of procurement having been proven, one possible new role 
could be that of a procurement agency for leased lines
281
, dark fibers, optical transmission and 
Internet related equipment, thus allowing additional services to be provided by other parties, 
including themselves !  
According to the 4WARD [397] terminology, this means that DANTE could resell capacity to 
VNOs
282
, instead of being themselves the only VNO using their own infrastructure. As a matter 
of fact several FP7
283
 [398] EC projects like 4WARD, already mentioned,  but also GEYSERS 
[399] have proposed new roles for Telecom operators taking advantage, in particular, of 
virtualization techniques, that open a bunch of new promising perspectives: “The Physical 
Infrastructure Provider (PIP) owns and manages the physical infrastructure (the substrate), and provides 
wholesale of raw bit and processing services (also known as slices), which support network virtualisation. 
The Virtual Network Provider (VNP) is responsible for assembling virtual resources from one or multiple 
PIPs into a virtual topology. The Virtual Network Operator (VNO) is responsible for the installation and 
operation of a VNet over the virtual topology provided by the VNP according to the needs of the Service 
Provider (SP), and thus realizes a tailored connectivity service.” 
Regarding joint procurement,  Mary Lennighan wrote an article in Total Telecom’s Easter 
review in April 2011) titled: “Eggcellent news” [400]: “European Telco adopt chocolate egg 
procurement model, This is effectively what France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom plan to do. The 
European incumbents on Monday revealed that they will combine their procurement activities into a joint 
venture that will eventually enable them to save €1.3 billion a year. They referred to the deal as the start of 
"a new era of smart industry cooperation”. The bulk of the savings will come from the joint purchase of 
network equipment, the operators said, which comes as no surprise given the growing pressure Telco are 
under to boost network capacity to support traffic growth, particular the data volumes being generated by 
increasing Smartphone use. And given that demand for network capacity is only going to go up, the days of 
network operators going Easter egg shopping alone  is coming to an end. 
Another issue is that the main purpose of both NRENs and DANTE is to provide high QoS 
levels to research traffic, i.e. traffic between researchers, however, the common practice of 
sharing a single NREN access line for research as well as commercial Internet traffic may defeat 
this sound principle, if the capacity of the access line is not properly dimensioned and/or 
                                                 
279
 Not including the NRENs share of roughly the same amount! 
280
 joint procurement of high speed (e.g. 10Gb/s) circuits 
281
 Including connectivity outside the GEANT community which is one of the most valuable aspect of GEANT 
282
 Virtual Network Operators 
283

October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 82 
managed, with the result that QoS cannot be guaranteed; therefore, I believe that the canonical 
NREN configuration should be two access lines, either physical or logical, in order to ensure high 
QoS to the research traffic. 
In addition, there is a schism between commercial and academic and research networks as 
exemplified by GÉANT3, a state of the art R&E backbone running all the services and features 
that almost no commercial ISP is offering, e.g. Multicast, IPv6, QoS, BoD
284
. Even worse, these 
promising new services are, to the best of my knowledge, little used by the very community who 
claimed they needed it, thus there is a definite risk that the available effort and expertise is 
misused and that, instead of pioneering new technologies and services together with Telecom 
Operators and ICT
285
 suppliers, off-the-shelves networks and/or new special purposes services 
(e.g., lambdas on demand) with questionable commercial viability, i.e. high costs, hence no or 
little demand, are built! 
Furthermore, the proportion of commercial vs. research traffic (i.e. intra and inter NRENs) 
traffic is difficult to know, however, it is one of the most critical metrics to measure in order to 
design new NREN networks; in other words, is the traffic composition roughly balanced or 
grossly imbalanced in favor of commercial traffic? Unfortunately, DANTE’s definition of 
commercial traffic, namely that all traffic originating from or destined to universities can be 
classified as research traffic, does not help especially as the public visibility over the GEANT  
traffic is utterly unsatisfactory, e.g., why are the traffic statistics of GEANT [401] not publicly 
available, unlike those of Internet2 [402]?  
Admittedly some progress have been made in the right direction recently as a “weather map” 
[403] visualizing the instantaneous traffic between NREN and GEANT in both directions is now 
publicly available, actually showing that the customers of DANTE’s World Services
286
 appear to 
have a much higher use of their access line to GEANT than the NRENs that take care of their 
own Internet connectivity, e.g., France, Germany, Switzerland. 
9.1 The Birth of European National Research and Education Networks  
Major differences of attitudes can be observed between European countries and network 
research centers, namely: a few were constructive and creative, e.g. UCL [404] (UK) and INRIA
 
[21] (France) with their significant contributions to the MBONE tools and the related protocols, 
e.g., SIP [405]; JANET (UK) with the “Coloured Book”; unfortunately, several countries 
followed counter-productive academic and research networking policies for purely political 
motivations, i.e. that of taking power, e.g. Belgium, Germany, Spain.  Fortunately, many 
countries were more pragmatic e.g., the Nordic countries through NORDUnet actually led the 
way to wider adoption of TCP/IP in Europe as well as the Netherlands and Switzerland through 
SURFnet and SWITCH, and, of course, CERN which in many respects can be seen in the 
networking arena as a country in its own right, because of its leading role due to its dependence 
on first class networking infrastructure to fulfill its mission.  
Another major issue very well explained by P. Kirstein was the dilemma between “networking 
for research” versus “networking research”. The Research and Education community clearly 
needed the two, given the lack of suitable standards in these very early days of the networking 
history, hence the big confusion that arose. In practice, most NRENs and, in particular, DANTE 
bear troubling similarities with commercial ISPs and “networking research” is clearly outside 
their remit; therefore, it should be left to more qualified partners such as, Universities, Private

 Commercial Internet as well as NREN traffic

and/or Public Research Laboratories in collaboration with the Internet industry (i.e. equipment 
suppliers, ISPs) and when additional funding is needed, the European Commission, which is 
rather more healthy. 
There are good and bad NRENs as well as small, medium and large NRENs; the larger 
NRENs, e.g., RENATER (France), DFN (Germany), JANET (UK) being more difficult to 
manage than the smaller ones like ARNES [406] (Slovenia), RHNET [407] (Iceland) or SWITCH 
[408]. 
There is no generic NREN model; their only common characteristic is to provide a single 
access to the Internet, at large, i.e. the commercial Internet as well as other NRENs worldwide, 
including, of course, the European NRENs.  
Indeed, few NRENs share the same organizational and architectural structure. For example, 
RENATER has a structure similar to GEANT in the sense that it mainly offers a backbone 
interconnecting the, so called, “plaques régionales
287
” which is actually very similar to the 
original NSFnet structure with Regional Networks and/or Internet2/Abilene with GigaPops. 
NORDUnet bears some similarities with RENATER, if one considers the Nordic countries as 
“Scandinavian” regions; otherwise, it could be considered as a mini or rather a regional clone of 
GEANT. 
The cost model is also very different going from central funding, i.e. captive users, cost shared 
using all possible combinations of “more or less fair” key distribution. The services portfolio also 
varies considerably, e.g. RENATER provides an anti-spam service. In the early days of 
RENATER,  most “regional networks” were commercial networks serving a region or parts of it, 
whose infrastructure was usually not dedicated to research customers, thus providing extremely 
variable quality of service, though at fairly high prices to RENATER customers. 
To the best of my knowledge, Chile is one of the very first countries that tried to build its 
NREN in a more open way, i.e. by accepting commercial customers in addition to research and 
education members in order to be self-sufficient. Indeed, according to article by Larry Press
288
 
“Will Commercial Networks Prevail in Emerging Nations?” [409] back in spring 1997 “The 
Internet is clearly in commercial hands in Chile, and the university and research community has not 
suffered. Will this happen in other emerging nations with market economies? If so, will it be good for the 
university community?”  
The above article is well worth reading although its title is misleading, indeed what it 
describes is that, back in 1997, there were two National Research and Education Networks in 
Chile, REUNA (National University Network) [410], the oldest and RdC (Networks of 
Computers) and that “From their inception, (both) RdC and REUNA planned to become self-sufficient by 
providing commercial service as well as by serving universities. Today RdC is roughly 60 percent 
commercial, and a visit to the REUNA offices has the feel of REUNA's being a completely commercial 
enterprise with an aggressive marketing department”.  The presentation made by Florencio Utreras, 
REUNA Executive Director, in Hawaii at about the same time “How an Academic Network can 
be Self-Funded” is also very interesting [411] as well as the history of REUNA [412].  
Since then, the Latin America National Research and Education Networks have federated 
themselves under the CLARA consortium [413].  
I must admit that I do not know whether REUNA continued along the same line, however, in 
the early days of the European Internet, similar evolutions/temptations could be observed, e.g. 
CESNET (Czech Republic), NASK (Poland), RENATER (France), SWITCH (Switzerland) and 
                                                 
287
 Regional Networks

probably many others had non-academic and research customers for good or bad reasons, e.g. 
historical, special commercial links, local administrations etc. Although there is nothing wrong 
with that on a national scale, problems may rise if/when public funded infrastructures, such as 
GEANT, carry traffic between non R&E members, even if this phenomenon is probably very 
marginal. 
The situation in the USA is also very instructive as, following the demise of NSFnet and the 
failure by the emerging commercial ISPs to satisfy the needs of the R&E community, Internet2 
was very successfully built on the ashes of NSFnet without public funding. What is, however, 
intriguing is the emergence of NLR as an Internet2 competitor, a first case in the NREN history 
as the battle for power usually happens before the establishment of an NREN and not after!  
During the last 10 years there has been an irresistible trend towards the use of dark fiber based 
network infrastructure, either long term lease, also called IRU
289
 [414], or purpose-built and it is 
not clear to me whether this is a positive evolution in the long term despite the fact that the cost 
benefits are undisputable in the short-to-medium term?  
9.1.1 Tentative conclusions 
Whereas most NRENs were initially established with public funding, I believe that most of 
them have become financially independent; however, this is far from being the case of GEANT!  
There are no doubts that NRENs are monopolies but, as already stated, this was definitely a 
necessary step as there were many benefits resulting from joint procurements, e.g., economy of 
scale, ease of operations, added value services, etc. However, given the falling prices of the 
commodity Internet, the efficiency of the NREN model in terms of price/performance may be 
questioned?  
Should they all be privatized, or split or just kept “as is” is not an easy question as there is no 
single answer?  But, at the very least, a cost/benefit analysis must be conducted, in my humble 
opinion.  
The NREN model having been almost universally adopted there can be no doubts whatsoever 
about   its attractiveness. However, the NREN model is a closed one and this is questionable, e.g., 
TERENA, apart from a few special cases such as CERN and ESA, only accepts National 
Networks as members which has two implications: 
1. The nation in question must be recognized by the International community at large, 
whatever this means, e.g. UN membership. There have been several problematic cases 
in the past with Northern Cyprus [415] and Macedonia [416]; without any doubts, 
there will be many other cases… 
2. There must be one and only one NREN per country, hence a lasting problem with 
Russia which had three research networks competing for the NREN title, namely: 
RASNet
290
, RUNNet
291
 and RBNet
292
. The problem is not only with TERENA, where 
Russia is not represented, but with DANTE and therefore GEANT. It is only very 
recently
293
 that a hopefully lasting agreement was reached [417] thanks to “the joint 
efforts of DANTE and the e-ARENA Association [418], Russia’s National Research and 
Education Network (NREN) jointly with JSCC of RAS”.

Nonetheless “the dice are loaded”, in other words there are clearly dogmatic issues, e.g., 
NORDUnet is breaking the TERENA as well as the DANTE/GEANT model; therefore, within 
TERENA the Nordic countries are members and NORDUnet is an associate member, whereas 
within the GEANT consortium NORDUnet is the formal partner; indeed, there is a single 
connection between GEANT and NORDUnet, an exception that the DANTE management would 
not like to see repeated as, according to a private conversation I had with a DANTE director long 
time ago, this would break the DANTE/GEANT model which is a rather surprising statement! 
Of course, it would diminish the power of DANTE, if various parts of Europe were to follow 
the NORDUnet model; however, there would still be a need to connect these regional networks 
together. So, what is the real problem apart from the relative loss of influence of DANTE which 
would be a rather positive than a negative evolution, I think! 
DANTE’s logic regarding Russia and NORDUnet was utterly disconcerting, given the 
respective size of the Russian federation compared to the Scandinavian countries, as they could 
have had three connections to Russia instead of a single one while, more or less at the same time, 
they insisted on having 5 connections to the Nordic countries instead of one connection to the 
NORDUnet PoP in Stockholm! 
The other significant remark is that the Internet traffic shifted from being mostly academic to 
being mostly commercial; in addition, commercial ISPs performance improved very significantly, 
e.g., most Tier1 ISPs can sign contracts with SLAS guaranteeing near-zero packet losses within 
their backbone. Admittedly, NRENs improved too but if the traffic composition shifted from 
R&E to commercial, i.e., 50% or more, what is the real meaning of NRENs beyond 2011, 
especially as the bandwidth-demanding user communities have rebuilt their own mission-oriented 
backbones?  
The question of whether NRENS should be involved in networking research activities should 
also be asked. 
In my opinion, this is the role of their members be they Universities or research organizations 
like INRIA, KTH, University of Amsterdam, consequently, NRENs, as such, should not be 
involved in EC projects, apart from infrastructure building projects, i.e., GEANT or like projects. 
Obviously, it is also clearly the role of NRENs to introduce new services ahead of commercial 
ISPs, e.g. IPv6. 
The good news, though, is that I am not the only one to question the need for updating the roles 
of the NRENs and GEANT; indeed as part of the GN3 project [419], ASPIRE
294
 [420], an 18 
months long  study led by John Dyer (TERENA) [421], has been launched on 1 April 2011. 
However, the not so good news is that the EC released a report titled “Knowledge without 
Borders: GEANT 2020 as the European Communications Commons” in October 2011 [422]. 
This report was produced by the GEANT Expert Group that mainly gathered the main actors, i.e. 
DANTE, NRENs, and TERENA. Getting together the judge and the parties is a well proven way 
to plead for its own cause without seriously looking at the deficiencies
295
 of the system. Not 
surprisingly, the report is proceeding by assertions, only vaguely alluding to tough yet unresolved 
issues, and is essentially self-congratulations for the outstanding research and innovative results 
achieved by GEANT and the NRENs, while carefully avoiding being too specific [423]! 
To conclude on a slightly provocative remark, most early networks, including EARN/BITNET, 
disappeared why would not some NRENs, including GEANT, follow this trend or, at the very 
least, change their business model radically?

9.1.2 Some Specific National Research and Education Networks (NREN) 
It would not make much sense to comment on each NREN given that this article is already too 
long; therefore, I tried to “pick-up” the most representative ones in more or less random order. 
9.1.2.1 JANET [130] 
 
 The unique aspects of JANET 
have already been widely covered 
in several chapters of this article, in 
particular the use of the UK 
“Coloured Book”; however, it is 
worth stating again that the UK was 
well ahead

 of any other 
European countries; indeed, 
SERCNET
297
 [169], the first 
European NREN, although a rather 
embryonic one, was started in 
1974
298
, together with EPSS
299
. Its 
successor, JANET, a full scale 
NREN, came into service in April 
1984 which is truly exceptional.   
9.1.2.2 DFN [425] 
 
As rightly pointed out by Peter Kirstein in [13] “The question of whether everything should be 
connected together was still a problem, partly because Germany having a federal structure, much of the 
educational funding is by “Lander
300
” rather than national. This is reflected in DFN, “German Research 
Network” rather than German National Research Network”. Although all European countries had 
networking activities, few, except the UK had a real NREN even in planning. “Germany was an 
exception; they started planning DFN in the early ‘80s, and the official organization was founded in April 
1984”.  
DFN’s first network WIN only went live in 1989 and was a 64 Kb/s X.25 network, as useless 
as IXI, where, if my memory serves me well, additional charges were even requested for non-
ISO/OSI users, i.e. Internet users! However, DFN had to face some hard opposition, for example 
University of Dortmund (Rüdiger Volk) was very active in EUnet, Karlsruhe University had the 
project to build a CSNET node and BelWue, the Academic Network of the Federal State of 
Baden-Wuerttemberg was openly challenging the DFN organization for many years and, although 
it has a direct connection with DFN, it also has direct connections to SWITCH through a cross-
border fiber and to the DE-CIX [426] in Frankfurt, one of the three largest IXPs in Europe and 
also has its own commercial Internet connection through TELIA [427].

 10 years or so; in addition UK was the 1st European country to liberalize the telephony and data communications 
market as early as 1990.

 “The real start of networking can be accurately dated to 22 March 1974” P. Bryant [169]

and ARPANET, in particular.

9.1.2.3 BELNET [428] 
Belgium was, by far, one of the least advanced countries, networking wise, under the 
influence of a (now retired) University professor who had a marked dislike of American-invented 
protocols, especially TCP/IP and whose dream was an “all OSI” world. Because of his close 
connections with the EC, he may have played, together with many others, a questionable 
misinformation role!  When BELNET was finally created in 1993, its representative at the EARN 
Board of Directors told me that his main achievement had probably been to delay the creation of 
BELNET by several years, which was surely a bad “joke”  
9.1.2.4 NORDUnet [222] 
Not surprisingly, given the consensus building culture of Nordic
301
 countries, NORDUnet was 
built in a very pragmatic and effective manner avoiding, in particular, the trap of being divided 
into too many small networks with no political weight.  NORDUnet played a major role in the 
adoption of EARN, EUnet and Internet in Europe and, for that reason, was very much disliked by 
the RARE activists. However, NORDUnet was very innovative in many ways with, for example, 
the sharing of networking roles between Denmark (education), Finland (services), Norway 
(research) and Sweden (infrastructure as well as services). 
 
9.1.2.5 SURFnet [429] 
It is not very clear whether the much heralded results of SURFnet’s are really up to the 
expectations. However, it is an undisputable fact that NETHERLIGHT has become the highest 
concentration point of high speed, academic use, circuits
302
 in Europe and probably in the world, 
thus surpassing StarLight in Chicago and CERN, and that SURFnet is the NREN that is most 
engaged in Networking Research.  
But, whereas CERN together with the LHC community worldwide have a clear mission and 
will no doubt make heavy use of their networking infrastructure, it is far less obvious to predict 
what NETHERLIGHT will really achieve apart from being an extremely convenient transit point 
in Amsterdam that is also known as Europe’s Internet capital, actually a well-deserved title.  
As noted in my article “State of the Internet and Challenges ahead” [430], the emphasis on 
all-optical networks, bandwidth on demand, etc., is puzzling as I am extremely doubtful about the 
viability of commercial on-demand lambdas, especially inter-provider ones, as most, if not all, 
major Telecom Operators are able to provide a more or less equivalent service with MPLS layer 
2. The confusion between “fast provisioning” and “switched” lambdas (i.e. sub-second set-up 
time) appears to be purposely maintained; in any case, the related work does not appear to be 
progressing very fast, to say the least!  
In any case, the repeated failures of commercial switched data services, e.g. 64Kb/s, SMDS 
 
[431] do not appear to have been taken into account!  
9.1.2.6 RENATER [432] 
The fights between IN2P3 and CNRS, on the one hand, but also between the Ministry of 
Research and the Ministry of Education in France, considerably delayed the creation of 
RENATER that only took place in 1993. Although France was a very active RARE member and 
was not short of RARE activists, the relationship deteriorated after the Killarney meeting in 1990 
and the creation of Ebone.  One reason why France was unhappy with both RARE and DANTE, 
though I am not completely sure, may be related to the results of several RARE and DANTE 
                                                 
301
 Denmark, Finland, Iceland. Norway, Sweden

tenders (e.g., IXI, EMPB) where France Telecom, probably for very valid reasons, had not been 
selected. Therefore, RENATER became a strong supporter of Ebone and as it was also 
participating in the D-GIX and one of the recipients of the NSF ICM award, there were three 
“good” reasons for not being appreciated by RARE and DANTE. In the end, RENATER under 
the leadership of Danny Vandromme 
 
[433] became a shareholder of DANTE in 2000; Danny 
Vandromme then served as member of the DANTE Board
303
 from January 2001 before becoming 
the Chairman of the DANTE Board for 2 years from January 2003. 
 
9.1.2.7 GARR [434] 
There was a very similar situation to that of France, in Italy between INFN and CNR and, to 
some extent in the USA between DoE and NSF; however, Italy being one of the founding 
member of DANTE was therefore a shareholder. 
9.1.2.8 SWITCH [408] 
SWITCH was the very first NREN to be 100% IP, a very brave undertaking that deserves to be 
underlined. SWITCH was also the first NREN to deploy a dark fiber infrastructure. Unfortunately 
there were a number of unconditional X.400 adepts in Switzerland; for example, a now retired 
Geneva University professor was not only the very first but also the very last X400 users in 
Switzerland; as gateways between the fading X400 world and Internet were very fragile, the 
assistance of an almost full time student was necessary in order to keep the illusion that 
Switzerland was on the right side of the, long time lost, standards battle   
9.2 Tentative conclusions 
Would not both NRENs and DANTE/GEANT have been much more successful if less time 
had been spent in building new monopolies and is it not time to take a fresh look? 
In this regard, a very interesting set of comments was provided by Paul van Binst (ULB) in the 
last-but-one slide of his excellent presentation at TNC2008 [435] “Is the non-NREN world 
overtaking us”? 
1. “We have far exceeded our wildest expectations/dreams in terms of Quantity 
2. We are (happily?) often forgetting about Quality 
3. The non NREN world is overtaking us with Functionality 
4. Food for thought: does the NREN world need a (new) business model?” 
 
Very similar views have actually also been expressed in my article “State of the Internet and 
Challenges ahead” [430]. 
 To conclude I cannot refrain from quoting the humorous and sarcastic remarks of Paul Bryant: 
“Talking about competition and monopolies, I wonder what would happen if DFN, for example, were to 
offer to connect up a UK university in competition with JANET? Interestingly, schools in the UK can be 
connected via JANET, or their Local Authority or via a commercial ISP and examples of all these exist. 
Also, interestingly, JANET now runs a backbone with regions running regional networks. I suspect that in 
the long run the NRENs will have difficulty competing with other network providers. Maybe in the spirit of 
the EU the NRENs should amalgamate
304
 and then they may have the same outstanding success
305
 as the 
EU ”

10 The roles of DARPA and NSF 
The lack of wider Internet acceptance in Europe, in particular, was largely due to the 
involvement of DARPA [436], the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US 
DoD
306
 nourishing suspicions about the real agenda of the “big brother”!  
NSF played a major role being the initiator of CSNET and NSFNET while also funding 
transatlantic links.  
“In 1984-1985, the NSF began construction of several regional supercomputing centers to 
provide very high-speed computing resources for the US research community. In 1985, four new 
supercomputer centers were established with NSF support—the John von Neumann Center at 
Princeton University, the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), the National Center for 
Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois (NCSA), and the Cornell Theory 
Center, a production and experimental supercomputer center. NSF later established in 1986 the 
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC). The Interim NSFnet Backbone went online in 1986, as 
a backbone to which NSFnet regional and academic networks would connect. The six backbone 
sites were interconnected with leased 56 Kb/s and routers were PDP-11 minicomputers, called 
“Fuzzballs”. As NSFnet’s regional networks began to grow the NSFNET backbone traffic 
experienced exponential growth, therefore very high packet loss rates and became essentially 
unusable. The Interim NSFNET backbone also proved the fragility of the External Gateway 
Protocol (EGP) and the need for a better structured network. As a result of a November 1987 
NSF award to a consortium of universities in Michigan, the original 56 Kb/s links were upgraded 
to 1.5 Mb/s by July 1988 and again to 45 Mb/s in 1991. More important, the network was 
managed in such a way that the routing announcements of the external networks, i.e. US regional 
networks, but also international networks, were filtered in order to avoid routing loops and sub-
optimal routing because of routing announcement mistakes by external peers but also back doors, 
i.e. connections between regional networks, for example.”The main victims of the dismantlement 
of NSFNET were the US Universities, as the mission oriented communities such as the space, 
magnetic fusion and high energy physics communities were already self-organized. However, the 
original purpose of NSFNET was to interconnect supercomputer centers which were continued 
after the demise of NSFNET as a specialized network dubbed vBNS (very Broadband Network 
Service). 
The Interim NSFnet backbone proved the need for an NSFnet backbone network – as originally 
envisioned – and was replaced by the T1 backbone (and later T3, etc) at the earliest opportunity. 
The success of the NSFnet Programme was in building a three tier national research inter-network 
(or Internet) comprised of campus networks (of which there were very few when NSFnet was 
started), a large number of Regional networks (all stimulated by the NSFnet Programme, 
including a T1 network, BARRnet), Supercomputer Centre Networks (SDSCnet centered on 
SDSC in San Diego and the T1 JvNCnet centered on CSC/JvNC in Princeton), the expanded 
ARPANET, CSNET, BITNET (with TCP/IP), and the NSFnet Backbone. 
In order to implement NSFNET’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), NACR
307
  and PRDB
308
 were 
used to filter incoming routing announcements, with two distinct purposes: 1) avoid routing loops 
to EGP 2) authorize networks one by one thus preventing access to NSFNET by some networks.  
                                                                                                                                                 
305
 Editor’s note: as already exemplified by DANTE. Regarding the EU, while I agree that it could work better I do not 
consider its construction as a failure, on the contrary. 
306

In order to counter the result of NSF’s AUP that were de facto preventing former Eastern-bloc 
countries to participate in the “nascent” Internet, political routing was made by Peter Löthberg, 
the Ebone “skipper”, in order to ensure Internet connectivity to these countries. Ebone itself was 
AUP free, a major step forward in the early 1990s. 
One reason behind the dismantling of NSFNET was the increasing pressure from the 
commercial ISPs who saw public NSF subsidies as unfair competition and it is actually surprising 
that, to my knowledge, nobody has challenged the procedures through which the EC allocates 
huge amount of money to DANTE, as the sole bidder, in response to Call for proposal to 
interconnect NRENs, being understood, however, that, because of the “Subsidiarity” principle, 
NRENs fall out of the EC remit. 
10.1 DARPA funded links to Europe 
 As already explained in chapter 2.4, DARPA played a fundamental role in the creation of the 
Internet by funding the research as well as the deployment of ARPANET. DARPA also funded 
five satellite links to Europe (chapter 7.1 CCIRN). 
More information about the early Internet history and the role of DARPA as well as the pre-
ICANN Internet organization can be found in [437] and [438] 
10.2 The first general purpose link between Europe and NSFnet 
As already indicated, NORDUnet pioneered the coordinated use of TCP/IP between the Nordic 
countries therefore, not surprisingly, they established the first general-purpose link
309
 between 
Europe (KTH in Stockholm) and NSFnet (JvNC in Princeton) as early as August 1988. This very 
important historical feat is reported in detail in the “US Connection” chapter of “The History of 
NORDUnet” [353]. The main drivers on the NORDUnet side were Mats Brunel (SICS) and Juha 
Heinänen (FUNET) [439], whereas on the US side Lawrence Landweber (Wisconsin University) 
and Steven Wolff (NSF) had the key roles. 
. 
10.3 NSF ICM award and STAR TAP 
The NSF ICM award that was followed by the Euro-Link 
 
[440] award (1999-2004), greatly 
helped selected European networks, initially, IUCC/ILAN (Israel), NORDUnet, RENATER and 
SURFnet, later CERN, to connect to the STAR TAP exchange point in Chicago. 
STAR TAP and ICM made many people unhappy; first of all, unsurprisingly, those who did 
not receive the award, but also the choice of the location that was seen as “non-neutral” i.e. not 
enough East coast for Europe and not enough West coast for the Asia-Pacific countries, only 
adequate actually for CANARIE.  
One objective reason for the choice of Chicago was undoubtedly the richness of the scientific 
community in the Chicago area (ANL, FNAL, University of Chicago, UIC, NCSA, Northwestern 
University, University of Michigan, MERIT, etc.) and the existence of the MREN
310
, a multi-state

a 64 Kb/s terrestrial (submarine) link.

advanced network devoted to data intensive science which connected all of these institutions and 
others. STAR TAP leveraged the existing MREN infrastructure... 
Whereas, the additional costs of reaching STAR TAP were initially relatively marginal 
compared to the prohibitive costs of transatlantic circuits back in 2005, they became rather 
significant afterwards following the sharp decrease of these due to the fierce competition between 
Telecom Operators and the transatlantic bandwidth “glut” 
 
One of Steve Goldstein’s favorite jokes when talking to the RARE people about sharing the 
costs of the transatlantic lines was: “I am the hub you are the spoke” needless to say this kind of 
joke was not very well taken by people like James Hutton, Klaus Ullmann, Enzo Valente and, 
more generally the non-ICM awardees! 
 
Another recurring difficulty was about who should pay the cost of transatlantic lines, i.e. 
Europe only, shared costs, etc., a “thorny” subject that was only settled rather recently between 
NSF and DANTE. 
11 The Role of the European Commission (EC) 
During RARE WG6 meetings, EEC’s DG XIII representative used to say that he was acting 
according to the orientations provided by the member states, while those, when questioned about 
the wisdom of the EEC orientations, would tell you exactly the opposite, a kind of “cat and 
mouse” game! Being better informed than I was at the time about the EC way of working, it is 
very likely that it was the conservatives who were able to influence the EC and not the reverse; 
there is also nothing wrong with that except for the lack of “intellectual honesty”.  
On the contrary, Paul Bryant believes “that the EEC was influenced by a set of ISO fanatics who 
suggested that adoption of ISO would be good for European industry and good for European political 
cohesion.” And has some rather hard words against Nick Newman: “I suspect that he played no small 
part in that process. I first met Nick when he was doing a tour of European networking sites possibly in 
1983 when he was attempting to get some idea of what part the EEC could play in networking or maybe 
finding a use for DG XIII and himself.” 
I personally think that Nick Newman was a kind of “free electron” that contributed to 
exacerbate the ISO/OSI debate, which is kind of normal and also frequent in High Energy Physics 
Laboratories such as CERN but was definitely utterly inappropriate for an EEC civil servant. 
11.1 Advanced Communication and Telecommunication Services (ACTS)  
The ACTS [441] “program was established under the 4
th
 Framework Program of European 
activities in the field of research and technological development and demonstration (1994-1998) 
with a budget of 671 million ECU, i.e. about 5% of the total budget available for European 
research under the 4
th
 Framework Program. Given the global nature of the communications 
business, ACTS encourages participation from non-EU countries. Indeed organizations from 
anywhere in the world can participate in the Program on a project-by-project basis without 
Community funding once their participation is shown to be of mutual benefit to the parties 
involved.”.  
 
ACTS was an excellent, high impact [442], program; one of its most visible achievements was 
in the area of mobile networks with the work on GSM
311
 and UMTS [443]. However, GSM came 
                                                 
311
 Global Service Mobile 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 92 
through ETSI [445] and ETSI was setup by the EU. The GSM history [444] is very informative 
about the "hard” technological battles preceding the adoption of a common industrial standard 
between the major players, in this case the "big four", namely UK, Germany, Italy and France. 
There are actually troubling similarities with the RARE-EARN battle except that the GSM 
standards battle was industry-led, therefore more efficient because of the expected short-term 
commercial impact. 
 
The BETEL project (1993) was followed by the European ATM pilot [299], during 1994-
1995, whose main objective was to confirm inter-operability of ATM “cross connects” in a multi-
vendor and multi-operator environment. The pilot was organized with the collaboration of 17 
European PNOs with one National Host 
 
[446] per country and was succeeded by JAMES
312
 
during 1996-1998 with twenty PNOs. “A second objective was to test the support of services and, 
in particular, the interworking between ATM and existing network infrastructures. User approval 
conditions, technical aspects and four benchmark services supported over the Pilot network are 
discussed.” 
 
The Role of BETEL [447] should not be underestimated given that, technically speaking, it 
was a very advanced project, well ahead of RARE’s pathetic attempts to establish a useful pan-
European networking infrastructure. BETEL, in very much the same way as DataTAG [448] and 
other targeted testbeds proved that well focused, user driven, projects could yield useful results 
far quicker that bureaucratic-led projects involving too many partners. 
  
BETEL was actually a meta-computing project a then fashionable concept, that Ben Segal 
(CERN) [449] rightly qualified as “A (very) distributed mainframe”
313
 [450]; in fact, a pre-GRID 
project on CERN’s emerging SHIFT infrastructure. BETEL would not have been possible 
without the active support of Frederic Hemmer and Bernd Panzer-Streidel who extended the 
CERN authentication mechanisms to IN2P3 and used the infrastructure to run real physics 
analysis jobs.  
11.2 COSINE 
For those interested in the COSINE study commissioned by the EC, there is an exhaustive 
description of it in DANTE’s book “A History of International Research Networking”. 
To be fair, the COSINE study “probably” made sense when it was started in January 1987 as a 
EUREKA [451] [452] project, but why did it take 18 months after the 1
st
 Networkshop held in 
Luxembourg mid-1985? 
In addition, it quickly became apparent that the COSINE project did not lead anywhere in the 
short term, which the OSI supporters refused to admit, hence the interesting statement of Horst 
Huenke (Vice Chairman of the Cosine Policy Group) when he realized he had been somewhat 
fooled by the OSI activists: “A constant property of OSI is that it is always around the corner” 
(RARE WP6 Symposium Brussels, 28 February 1989). He also had a solid sense of humor and 
several of his statements will remain in the OSI history, for example: 
1. “[Acronyms] is an area where we in Europe have profound experience. Our acronym 
technology is leading the world”. 
                                                 
312
 The ACTS project JAMES (Joint ATM Experiment on European Services) aimed at testing and evaluating, in 
collaboration with R&D user projects and national research networks, new ATM-based, broadband services and 
applications throughout Europe.

2. “If we ignore RIPE – we ignore the ‘real’ requirements; if we accept RIPE we sin 
against the holy principles of standardization.” (RARE Networkshop Blois, 14-15 
May 1991) 
There were three outcomes of COSINE 
 
[453] after a couple of years: 
1. “Set of 10 very thick, very blue volumes of COSINE specifications was issued. These 
10 blue books were summarized in a red book, which in turn was summarized in an 
orange executive overview.” 
2. It clearly helped to establish RARE as well as DANTE, i.e. provide an EC supported 
framework for European Research Networking. 
3. IXI314, a pitiful, more or less off-the-shelf, pan-European 64 Kb/s X.25 network that 
lasted until the end of 1992, that was basically unusable but which was nonetheless 
considered by its supporters, most notably James Hutton, then secretary general of 
RARE, as a “great” political achievement. IXI was later replaced by EMPP
315 
then 
EMPB
316 
(ended in Sept. 1995) that paved the way to Europanet from Oct. 1995 
onwards. In the meantime, i.e. since 1991 the really useful, i.e. used, backbone was 
Ebone, itself largely derived from EASInet but also HEPNET and EUnet.  
The presentation  given by Tomaz Kalin, then secretary general of RARE, 
 
at INET92 is a 
masterpiece of misinformation
317
 [454] as it purposely overemphasizes the role of COSINE, IXI 
and RARE while minimizing the role of Internet, whereas the battle had already long been lost! 
The remark made by Rainer Zimmermann (EC) during the FIA [26] meeting in Budapest in 
May 2011, speaking about the bureaucratic approach of the EC makes complete sense when 
applied to COSINE, in particular: “we are doing things right, process like, but are we doing the 
right thing?” 
Indeed, according to me, the COSINE study gave birth to a mouse i.e. a waste of money, time 
and efforts; however, according to DANTE’s History of International Research Networking (page 
68) it was “both a political and an organizational success, both of them having contributed 
substantially to the progress of European research networking”. In practice, there is little doubt 
that COSINE essentially contributed to slowing down rather considerably technical networking 
progress in Europe by actively promoting already obsolete solutions such as X.25, X.400, X.500 
and the ISO/OSI protocols and thus delaying the introduction of Internet protocols,  while also 
making EARN’s life as difficult as possible.  
In the end, it, however, failed to have a truly lasting negative impact which is, by itself, a great 
success.  
The “Subsidiarity” [455] principle was often used by the EC to oppose the RARE WG6 group 
led by the late J. Prevost from CEA who was, to my knowledge, the first person to propose a pan-
European multiprotocol 2Mb/s backbone which was exactly the right vision at that time. Like 
many pragmatic persons, Jacques Prevost was not well considered by the RARE CoA (Council of 
Administration).  
The same multiprotocol concept was reused by NORDUnet and EASInet in order to satisfy the 
needs of the divided networking community (X25, NJE, DECNET, SNA, TCP/IP) but came too 
early, in particular NOT an X.25 only backbone. The 64 Kb/s IXI (X25) fiasco was apparently a

necessary stage to pass before envisaging working solutions for the vast majority of users and not 
only the handful of X400 and FTAM addicts.  The successor of IXI was EMPB which, although 
much more restricted than EASInet, represented a significant progress. 
There were actually several ways to provide a multiprotocol backbone: 
1. Everything on top of X.25 
2. Everything on top of ATM 
3. Everything on top of TCP/IP 
4. Use of hardware multiplexers, either static or statistical, i.e. with dynamic 
reconfiguration. (similar to the NORDUnet “plug”) 
 
With the advent of Multi-Protocol Label switching (MPLS), it has now become even easier to 
provide multiprotocol functionality over the Internet, at large, using layer 2
 
VPNs. 
 
In practice, COSINE turned out to be a very expensive undertaking, producing a more or less 
“useless” study that led essentially nowhere from a practical perspective, i.e. IXI, Europanet and 
EMPB, that is three almost unusable
318
 Pan-European backbones! However, from a management 
perspective it led to the establishment of the DANTE company that, following the failures already 
mentioned, finally managed to deliver increasingly useable, therefore useful, though very high 
cost, networks to the Research and Education community, namely: TEN-34, TEN-155, then 
GEANT
319
. Unfortunately, GEANT3 is unlikely to mark the end of this undesirable and 
expensive monopoly as GEANT4 and its successors are more or less on their way already! 
 
To terminate on a more positive note and despite the fact that IXI brought too little too late, it 
cannot be denied that it had some positive effects.  First of all it was a proof by demonstration 
that federated X.25 networks were not at all easy to operate, second it actually helped the 
introduction of TCP/IP in Europe! More precisely, IXI could not prevent the Internet wave from 
reaching Europe as X.25 had, at least, one nice property that of being protocol agnostic. 
 
Niall O’Reilly has a more balanced view of the impact of IXI: 
 
1. Politically, it paved the way for DANTE 
2. It undermined the (already shaky) motivation for an EARN X.25 backbone 
3. Operationally, it Balkanized the X.25 efforts of the subscribing NRENs, as 
interoperability among this "federation" was not made a priority. Running an application 
(in my case, EARN's NJE/OSI) in a cloud of IXI-connected nodes required pairwise 
manual tuning of the application parameters in order to accommodate differences among 
the countries’ profiles.  Essentially, this was a PMTU
320
 problem! In contrast, on the 
EARN/EUnet/Nordunet X.25 backbone which IXI displaced, a quick phone call to the 
right person was all that was needed to ensure that any problem was resolved at the 
network level, once and for all, instead of escalating the problem through the complex 
and slow IXI operational procedures. 
4. Finally, IXI facilitated the expansion of IP networking in Europe, especially in peripheral 
countries like Ireland.  This was due to Rob Blokzijl's opportunistic and subversive 
initiative in offering IP/X.25 tunnel endpoints to interested partners on a router adjacent 
to the IXI AP at NIKHEF.  I seem to recall that the NIKHEF AP was regularly reported 
at AP Managers' meetings as carrying the greatest traffic
321
 load.

12 New Pan-European Backbone (PEB) Architecture Proposal 
Along the same line of thought that, relying on IBM proprietary protocols was indeed not a 
long term solution, relying on a single pan-European provider is also not a long term solution. 
Indeed, already 5 years ago or so the EC should have made a call allowing multiple providers to 
compete in order to spur innovation rather than “conservatism”. 
My rather poor opinion of DANTE is actually substantiated by their overly expensive 
achievements but also by their rather disappointing results from an advanced technical 
perspective. I also have the same opinion of some major NRENs, therefore my one and only 
recommendation is not “to dismantle DANTE” but to make an open call for tenders allowing a 
few (i.e. more than 1 and up to 4) complementary but innovative and interoperable backbone 
network providers to emerge. 
Organizationally, the actual setup of DANTE, a company whose shareholders are the NRENs 
and whose members of the Board are the same NRENs, is not very “appropriate”, to say the 
least, as a clear separation of roles is clearly needed in order to avoid conflict of interests. In the 
new proposed set-up, DANTE could still bid for one or more of the PEBs but NOT for ALL of 
them in order to preserve diversity and encourage innovation. 
This could actually be rather straightforward to implement if one were to adopt the following 
simple principles for future, i.e. post GEANT, Pan-European Backbones (PEB): 
1. Allow multiplicity; say up to four overlapping PEBs, with the overlapping zones well 
defined in the call for proposal, e.g. North, West, South, Central, and East. A 
regionalization of GEANT, so to speak, i.e. a replication of the Nordunet model with 
the various regions interconnected by a much reduced “GEANT” core. 
2. Impose presence in a minimum number of countries; say 5-10, at the major Internet 
Exchange Point in those countries. In most countries, there is only one sensible choice, 
e.g. AMS-IX in the Netherlands, the CIXP at CERN in Switzerland, the LINX in 
London, etc. 
3. Encourage innovation not conservatism and status-quo, by making it an explicit part of 
the project proposal. 
4. Be cost effective, i.e. a PEB should be as cost effective as its commercial counterparts, 
if not cheaper because of joint procurement, economy of scales and not for profit. 
5. Separate data transmission from the services provided on the transport infrastructure in 
the same manner as it is done in the field of railways, electricity and airports, indeed, 
the separation of “containers” from their “contents” should there not be one of the 
guiding principles? 
A model similar to that used in the USA to create the RBOCs
322
 [456] off AT&T could be 
used. I would even propose to take one further step and apply the same design principles to some 
large European countries, e.g. France, Germany, in order to break the monopoly of the existing 
NRENs for the benefit of the users. 
It is interesting to note, that although Telecom deregulation was done in the USA much earlier 
than in Europe, it was poorly done as access lines were not deregulated which created lot of 
problems. Whereas, in Europe, the regulators introduced the concept of “unbundling” the local 
loop (i.e. not only the phone line, but also the access line, also called “backhaul”) which was far 
                                                 
322

better. To take a practical example the cost of pulling a pair of fibers between two racks, even 
belonging to the same Telecom Operator inside what the Americans called a “Carrier Hotel” 
could be absolutely prohibitive.  
For example, reaching STAR TAP that was part of the Chicago NAP operated by Ameritech 
proved to be a nightmare, hence its later replacement by StarLight a new IXP with the choice of 
multiple carriers. Same problem in, so called, Carrier Hotels, i.e. “horrendous prices” to 
interconnect two floors and even to pull cables between two cabinets, e.g. in the Quest PoP I 
Chicago! 
13 “Future Internet” 
There is a lot of activity on both sides of the Atlantic, but also in Japan with the Akari project
 
[457] about the “Future Internet” and its relation to today’s Internet, namely “evolutionary” or 
“revolutionary” (i.e. clean-slate). NSF, NICT and the EC are all very active. Although these 
projects produced few tangible results, so far, things may well be changing with the recent 
creation of the “Open Network Foundation” [458] in March 2011, whose first task will be to 
adopt and then lead the ongoing development of the OpenFlow standard [459]. Internet2’s recent 
announcement 
 
[460] about NDDI and OS
3
E is extremely informative in this regard, as is Chris 
Robb’s (Ciena) Internet2 blog entry 
 
[461]: “Now that the Bandwidth Challenge is solved, what 
we are going to do with it?”  
But there are other proposals floating such as the “Beyond TCP/IP” [462] proposal made by 
Fred Goldstein and John Day for the Pouzin Society 
 
[463] in April 2010.  The TSSG
323
 [464] and 
i2CAT
324
 [465] will be joining forces with the Pouzin Society to contribute to the development of 
a RINA
325
 prototype based on the TINOS platform. A RINA tutorial as well as a short 
presentation are available from [466] and [467]. 
Virtualization technology is clearly opening new design opportunities, however the single vs. 
multiple Internet argument is slightly biased given that, with the advent of the new multilingual 
Internet, there is a de facto partition of the Internet as, because of the language barrier, large parts 
can no longer talk together! Therefore it is not as clear as before that the Internet dogma of a 
single network still is still so essential given that it has lost much of its original universality, 
nonetheless, the Internet is still clearly ubiquitous and the roles of the “social networks”, such as 
Facebook, Twitter, are growing at impressive speed! 
14 Conclusions 
The history of “European Networking” like, to a large extent, all history is one of power 
struggle; the protocol war was only used as a pretext in order to give some ideological foundation 
to the establishment of RARE, DANTE and, to some extent, a limited number of NRENs, in 
order to make it easier for the non-initiated to “separate the wheat from the chaff” (i.e. the good 
from the bad.) 
This article is about the worse aspects of the mankind i.e. self-interests, however, being also a 
networking article it is interesting to note that many of the network protocols and network names 
mentioned throughout this very long, though far from being exhaustive, article have already been 
forgotten long time ago. Of course the Internet will remain but who really cares about the

16 Am I qualified to write about the pre-history of the European 
Research Networks? 
As pointed out in the preface of the DANTE’s “History of International Research Networking” 
“a large number of people counted in hundreds if not thousands, have played some part”. 
However, what is not said in this preface is that an even larger number of people tried their best to 
fight, by all possible means, the penetration of the Internet in Europe. Unfortunately, many of 
these people are still in a dominant position which explains the repeated mistakes of DANTE and 
GEANT.  
While it is indeed true to state that the number of actors was more than just a handful of people; 
it is also a fact, even at the risk of looking pretentious, that I happened to be one out of very few 
European people that were uniquely placed to follow the development of the European Internet as 
well as its interconnection with the US Academic and Research Internet (i.e. NSFNET, Internet2) 
at Cornell University first, then STAR TAP and StarLight
 
 [468] in Chicago.  
Indeed, I was one of the three people at CERN who were very active during the whole pre-
Internet and proto-Internet periods, together with Brian Carpenter, Head of the Communication 
Systems (CS) group and François Flückiger, Head of the External Networking section until I took 
over his function mid-1989 when he was promoted CS group deputy leader. Hierarchically 
speaking my influence was very limited; nonetheless, I had some impact because I happened to 
be on the right technical side, either out of pure luck or maybe because I had sound technical 
judgment! 
In any case, I participated in the establishment of RIPE and in the development of EARN, 
EASInet and Ebone. I also served on the EARN Board of Directors and then on the TERENA 
board as the CERN representative and I was one of the three Europeans that participated in the 
founding meeting of the IEPG, that was held in Vancouver in August 1990 following the end of 
the protocol war. In other words I have been the witness of many important meetings. 
However, I was clearly “the last wheel of the carriage”, in other words I was mostly active 
operationally while the policy and decision makers at CERN were Paolo Zanella, David

 Actually the “living memory” of EARN as he is the only one to the best of my knowledge that was both on the 
EARN Executive and on the EARN BoD from the beginning to the end. He also kept paper copies of most official 
EARN documents.

Williams, David Lord, Brian Carpenter and François Flückiger. Therefore, I hope that this article 
will not give the false impression that I had “the” major role in the whole “pre and proto” Internet 
period that was definitely a collective undertaking. 
16.1 Am I neutral? 
 I have no shame in admitting that, back in the late 1970s early 1980s I was very appreciative 
of IBM, in general, and of its truly remarkable Research Laboratories, in particular.  
I also have to admit a strong bias against DANTE, first of all because, having rubbed shoulders 
with them for many years, I am well aware of their practices, in particular, the monopolistic style 
of the company but also their questionable attitude regarding information transparency (e.g. 
traffic statistics) and their rather mixed results in terms of both technical innovation and 
price/performance. 
Like many technically-oriented people, I had preferences for technically efficient, as well as 
proven, solutions offering good functionality and ease of use; hence my dislike for the overly 
complex as well as “ill-cooked” OSI technical standards developed under the ISO
 
[469] umbrella. 
16.2 Is this article still relevant? 
Anything that contributes to establishing the “truth” is, in my opinion, useful even if it is not 
exactly the same “truth” as that of the other actors. In any case, as there have been far too many 
deliberate cover-ups and hypocrisy by some of the key actors, I find it worthwhile to reflect about 
it, in order to try to understand how intelligent people can have been “blinded” to the extent of 
proposing “still-born” solutions that could have been detrimental to many people and, first of all, 
the academic community, but also the world, at large, given the importance of the Internet as a 
counter-power and a symbol of freedom of expression. 
Indeed, would there be a single worldwide Internet today if Europe, followed by other 
countries, had persisted in its “all-OSI” approach? 
There is no lack of historical examples of “collective blindness”, e.g., the sad communist 
experience and the numerous 20
th
 century genocides. Unfortunately, the scientific community that 
was expected to be above politics and politicians has shown in the Internet case as well as in 
some others that, being subject to various political pressures, they could easily lose their 
objectivity; indeed, as the history is repeating itself, one can see similar biased discussions around 
nuclear energy, global warming, use of GMO [470], etc.  
Therefore despite its limited scope and ambitions I hope that this article may be useful! 
17 The actors 
As stated earlier, the people mentioned in this article were for the most part very nice 
individuals; however they could be collectively “very dangerous”. As I like parodies and 
caricatures, the portraits below of some of the most emblematic European networking figures are 
probably excessive. In any case, I deliberately omitted the names of the people whom I consider 
to have had a bad influence; therefore they should easily recognize themselves 

17.1 CERN 
In addition to Brian Carpenter, François Flückiger, David Lord and myself, many other people 
at CERN played a decisive role because of their hierarchical position, most notably, P. Zanella, 
Data handling Division (DD) leader, his successor David Williams, Computing and Networks 
(CN) Division leader, Jacques Altaber, LEP accelerator control network group leader, as well as 
successive CERN research directors, J. Thresher, W. Hoogland, H. Wenninger who brought their 
political support to the networking strategies developed and implemented within the DD then CN 
divisions.  
However, the CERN person who was definitely the most influential and visionary one during 
the pre-Internet era was David Lord thanks to whom: 
1. The key role of CERN in EARN was agreed by the CERN hierarchy which greatly 
contributed to the quick adoption and penetration of EARN in Europe. 
2. TCP/IP was selected together with the IBM Token Ring as the technology for the LEP 
accelerator control network.  
Unfortunately, David Lord who was the 2
nd
 president of EARN (Dec. 1984-1987) retired from 
CERN fairly shortly afterwards and was therefore neither involved in the setting-up of RIPE nor 
in the subsequent development of the European Internet.  
Many other people played very important roles during this period, e.g. Maria Dimou, Denise 
Heagerty, Jean-Michel Jouanigot, Christian Isnard, Paolo Moroni, Ben Segal, Dietrich Wiegandt 
and, of course, Tim Berners Lee [471] and Robert Cailliau [472] with respect to the Web; 
however, neither Tim, Robert nor Ben were directly involved in the establishment of CERN’s 
external networking infrastructure. 
Dietrich Wiegandt designed and operated the MINT Gateway whose purpose, as excellently 
described by Denise Heagerty [473], was to interconnect recommended mail systems at CERN, 
i.e. EAN/X.400, Wylbur, Columbia Mailer and RICE Mail (i.e. ARPANET addressing over 
EARN plus gateway to the TCP/IP world) but also had connections to other systems thus 
indirectly providing an unequaled number of indirect mail gateways to every possible mail 
system, including DECNET, Grey Book, UUCP, native X.400 (which EAN was not), etc. 
Mervyn Hine [474], one of CERN’s founder members, was also very instrumental in the 
CERNET and STELLA
 
 [475] projects as well as in the RARE WG6 group “Medium and High-
Speed communications”. 
17.2 Peter Villemoes  
Peter Villemoes (NORDUnet) almost became an outlaw after the historic RARE Networkshop 
that took place in Trieste (Italy) in May 1989, i.e. only one month before the first RIPE meeting 
and where some “eminent” members of the RARE CoA (Council of Administration) stated that, 
as long as they would be in charge of their emerging national networks, these would “under no 
circumstances whatsoever” run the “infamous” Internet protocols, thus showing “a truly 
remarkable lack of vision” by even refusing to talk about IP and shutting down any mention of it!  
For those who have had the privilege to know Peter Villemoes, it was extremely difficult to 
attack him as he was the very example of an intellectually honest and collaborative man whose 
only motivation was to maximize the satisfaction of the NORDUnet user community in terms of 
quality of the infrastructure, innovation, quality of service, etc. Not surprisingly, one of the 
NSFNET funded lines to Europe ended in Stockholm (ICM award), KTH was the host of the first 
non-US DNS root server, Finland was extremely active in providing multimedia file repository, 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 100 
good FTP servers, remote conferencing, multimedia repository of academic courses and seminars, 
etc. 
17.3 Jan Gruntorad 
Thanks to his remarkable vision, Jan Gruntorad played a key role in the establishment of both 
CESnet [476], the Czech National network, and also CEEnet [477]; in my opinion, the palm of 
innovation should go to CESNET which has been deeply involved in developing cheap “PC 
based” routers as well as cheap “optical transmission equipment” which could greatly benefit 
former Eastern countries but also many others in Caucasia, Central Asia as well as Africa, 
Middle-East, etc.). 
17.4 James Hutton (RAL/RARE) 
Despite the fact that James Hutton was responsible for a leased 9.6 Kb/s line between 
Rutherford Lab (Oxford) and CERN using IBM’s RJE
327 
protocols, he was, at the same time, a 
very strong proponent of the UK “Coloured Book”. 
A contrasted personality, who became the 1
st
 secretary general of RARE and, as such, was at 
the heart of the IXI project, James Hutton was an unconditional supporter of X.25 to the point of 
becoming almost “addicted”!   
How intelligent persons such as James Hutton, as well as several others, e.g. Peter Linington
328
, 
could push X.25 protocols beyond reason remains a mystery to me. Indeed, whereas X.25 
protocols were well suited for Videotex [478] like applications like the French Minitel [479], i.e. 
low to medium speed interactive access to online databases and other interactive services (e.g. 
telephone directory access, e-services), they were ill-suited to high-speed networking
329
, in 
general, and to academic networking, in particular, as explained by Dennis Jennings in chapter 
5.5.2. 
17.5 Kees Neggers (SURFnet) 
A controversial, though most successful, individual, Kees Neggers was, to my knowledge the 
only person representing his own NREN, SURFnet, at both the EARN Board of Directors and the 
RARE Council of Administration (CoA). As a result, very few people really trusted him which 
may be one of the reasons why  he missed, by only one vote, the presidency of TERENA against 
Frode Greisen, the former president of EARN, at the time of the RARE/TERENA merger back in 
1994. 
Thanks to his outstanding political skills and his international experience, Kees Neggers 
quickly learned from the Americans the virtue of marketing advanced technical plans as well as 
their expected results, well ahead of time! 
17.6 Enzo Valente (INFN) 
Enzo Valente was a very interesting personality as, unlike some others, he could be both very 
creative but also very destructive, maybe an interesting case of networking “schizophrenia”   
                                                 
327
 Remote Job Entry stations were rightly considered like natural extensions of the prevailing mainframe environment 
of the 1970-1980 period and had therefore little to do with the emerging networking world.

October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 101 
Indeed, his complex personality was difficult to grasp, he definitely had a very strong dislike of 
American people, in general, but also David Williams, Kees Neggers and Peter Villemoes, and 
was the faithful ally of José Barbera (Spain), Jüergen Harms (Switzerland), James Hutton (United 
Kingdom) and Klaus Ullman (Germany). Although he had very original and subtle ideas, his poor 
command of English and his somewhat abrupt manners were a major handicap to get his ideas 
properly understood and therefore widely accepted.  
Whereas INFN was one of the main driving forces behind DECNET, they were also the first to 
understand that DECNET Phase V was still-born and that TCP/IP would then be ineluctable. 
Being very innovative, Enzo could not ignore historic collaborations between INFN and US 
Physics Lab (e.g. Fermi, SLAC); for example, INFN was the first European organization to try 
out Condor
 
[480] (Wisconsin University project), that became one of the essential ingredient of 
the HEP Grid, and was also a very early adopter of Grids  
Enzo Valente, like many other networking leaders of those times, wore far too many hats: 
INFN Computing Committee, GARR, HEPnet, RARE, etc. In addition, INFN was in fierce 
competition with other Italian organizations, e.g. CNR 
 
[481], in particular, but also CINECA 
 
[482]. There was a very similar situation in France between IN2P3 [103] and CNRS 
 
[483]. 
17.7 Eric Thomas 
Eric Thomas 
 
[484] is the perfect illustration of next-generation Information and Computing 
Technology experts; born in 1966, he was already a self-educated programmer at the age of 15, a 
rather exceptional precocity! A very young 20-years-old student in the early EARN days he 
immediately established himself as the EARN guru and could already speak as an equal with 
almost any computer specialist in the world. Eric Thomas was the author of the Chat/Relay 
service based on IBM’s NJE TELL command as well as the, so called, Revised LISTSERV [485], 
now L-Soft, file distribution system, which can be seen, in some way, as a precursor of Content 
Distribution Systems (CDN) such as Akamai, Google, Yahoo and various network appliances. 
17.8 Peter Löthberg 
Peter Löthberg, a leading Internet personality but also its “enfant terrible”, undoubtedly played 
a major role in the engineering of Ebone. While an extremely bright person, patience and 
tolerance were notoriously not his forte. Indeed, he had quite a few biases against the non-
commercial world, e.g., CERN, NSF, RARE, most NRENs, but also former Telecom monopolies, 
e.g., Telia, as well as IBM. In contrast, Cisco, Tele2 and Sprint were then his pet companies. 
Needless to say, all the ingredients for personal clashes were there, as he could not stand being 
contradicted by anyone. In addition, his high speed of speech made him difficult to understand - 
nonetheless, one must admit that he was right most of the time. Peter always carried tongs and 
screwdrivers in his pockets and enjoyed messing with routers and telecom hardware, but he was 
equally keen to give presentations to high level management.  During this key phase of European 
Internet development, Peter was assisted by Björn Carlsson (KTH), a top level IP engineer, and 
Frode Greisen, the General Manager of Ebone. Together, they achieved the goal of making Ebone 
one of the best engineered and managed IP network worldwide – for as long as it lasted. 
18 EARN/OSI  
18.1 EARN/OSI seen by its CTO Niall O’Reilly (UCD) 
 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 102 
“As I recall, IBM's 4 years sponsoring of EARN began back in 1983 or so. Besides lines, modems and a 
few VM systems, IBM contributed organizational support, both technical (Berthold Pasch) and managerial 
(Peter Streibelt, Alain Auroux).  An important cultural characteristic was the idea that IBM would not "run 
the show", but rather was expecting the responsibility for this to be taken on by the community. 
I see IBM's approach as both pragmatic and sophisticated.  It was perhaps an exemplary application of 
the "Subsidiarity principle": they contributed key resources which enabled the community to do something 
useful, and avoided the kind of interference which would have increased their costs and simultaneously 
antagonized the beneficiaries.  They were clever enough not only to find the "sweet spot" on the cost/benefit 
curve, but also to take a relatively long-term perspective and not look for early and tangible pay-back. I 
seems to recall also that, when the initial sponsorship ran to term, and EARN was not yet ready either with 
a replacement sponsor or with a means to draw adequate funding from its membership, IBM extended the 
sponsorship so that EARN would not collapse.  When implementation of the new deal with DEC and 
Northern Telecom (NT) began, NT took an even more "hands-off" position than IBM.  They contributed 
inventory, training and some support, during quite a short time window, and then more or less walked 
away, apparently content with whatever publicity or collateral benefit
330
 they could extract from the 
exercise
331
.  Both of these approaches suited a community of beneficiaries who simply needed resources to 
run their services, and were both aware of the requirements and competent to address them. DEC, 
however, took an approach which was less efficient, both for them and for the project for which they were 
the major sponsor.  Just as IBM was contributing resources both from European HQ (Paris) and 
Networking Centre (Heidelberg), DEC could have chosen to use Geneva and Valbonne to ensure that the 
project's Operations Center in Amsterdam was always in a position to do what was needed and useful, 
rather than merely following a plan which was too rigid. DEC seems not only to have been unable to 
comprehend and accommodate the culture within EARN of a network run by the participants for their own 
or their local customers' diverse needs, but also to have convinced itself that the EARN/OSI project was a 
campaign in a "turf war" with IBM, from whom DEC was going to seize operational control of the network 
and deliver the "benefits" of a "managed network" to the "customers". This Quixotic view of the situation 
led DEC to be frustrated on a number of counts: that EARN was so slow to migrate its traffic to the new 
backbone, that the EARN President was seemingly unable to command the organization to make this 
migration, and that DEC was contributing so much for such a slow return.  In addition, there was a deep 
suspicion towards the EARN Office, where IBM's own Alain Auroux was "clearly" obstructing the 
migration   My own impression is rather that Alain was doing all he could to support the OSI project 
while maintaining IBM's avoidance of operational interference, as also was Peter Streibelt on the EBOX 
front.  The actual obstacle to migration was the lack of bandwidth between each GBOX and its local 
connection point to the EARN backbone. It seems not to have occurred to DEC that IBM had taken its turn 
as main sponsor of EARN, and was not only quite happy to see someone else taking on the burden, but 
ready to co-operate as far as possible in enabling the community to continue running a service.  
DEC also seemed to suffer from a rather rigidly Balkanized corporate structure.  Although Geneva kept 
more than just "a finger on the pulse", the Earn/OSI Operation Center (EOC) manager apparently 
reported into DEC NL in Utrecht.  Delivery of the GBOXes was by DEC's profit centers in the target 
countries on the order of the EOC (as budget-holding cost center).  An amusing consequence of this was 
that, each time I had to make a site visit to a GBOX, I was faced with a different keyboard layout. A less 
amusing effect was that support for each GBOX was available only from the local DEC operation in the 
target country, which was in some cases not capable of delivering that support in English, as the following 
example may illustrate: Late in course of the project, it was finally understood that more bandwidth was 
needed between key GBOXes and their local national EARN nodes.  A key site was of course the CNUSC at 
Montpellier, where an SNA connection between FRGBOX and FRMOP22 was recognized as necessary.  
After DEC had, apparently reluctantly, agreed to fund the SNA module of the jNET product for installation 
on that GBOX, and the connection had been made, some debugging was necessary. Support from DEC was 
available, but only from DEC FR in Paris, and only in French!  I expect that IBM, in similar 
circumstances, would have provided support at European level and certainly in English.” 
                                                 
330 I seem to recall that NT's selection as supplier and sponsor of X.25 equipment for EARN was significant in 
enabling them to win other business in the academic community, and that either DFN and/or SURFnet was mentioned, 
but I am sure that NT didn't waste resources in useless follow-up to their well-defined contribution to the project. 
331
 Maybe they were already well aware of the imminent death of X.25 and were concentrating their efforts in other, 
more promising, technological directions like ATM (comment from O. Martin)

18.2 NORDUnet and EARN (Harri Salminen/FUNET) 
“The “green book” was used as the base document at the EARN to ISO Migration workshop in Perugia, 
there it became clear to us that a private fixed cost X.25 network would be economically more suitable for 
academic networking and that we needed continuity of NJE service over X.25 for an interim period to 
support our users before we had good OSI based alternatives for all the NJE services. The heaviest 
arguments were, as usual, in the X.25 infrastructure group on the use of public vs. private X.25, policies, 
topology and traffic statistics. The NJE over X.25 group concluded that the only available solutions for 
carrying NJE over X.25 were SNA which was recommended and JNET/DECNET which was seen as a 
possibility for some non-transit countries like Finland….Around that time, a NORDUnet project named 
X.EARN was started to design a multiprotocol Nordic academic and research network which would share 
same lines with the existing EARN traffic. Although the project’s name came from X.25 and EARN the 
successful result from its work was the NORDUnet network based on multinational bridged Ethernet  for 
TCP/IP, DECNET, X.25 CONS and CLNS instead of a X.25 based OSI only backbone as most other 
Europeans were planning at that time. During the course of the X.EARN project I wrote a paper on 
different ways for sharing lines with NJE, which is included as appendix G
332
. The paper was subsequently 
used in a part of the X.EARN project’s report. Most ideas I presented then are still valid except for the 
NJE/OSI that was realized afterwards with the backing of new sponsors. After the Perugia meeting new 
support came in to the picture: First, DEC promised to support EARN’s OSI migration by providing 
hardware, software, technical expertise and a small grant for upgrading four lines to 64Kbit/s that would 
form a square EARN X.25 backbone. Then Northern Telecom donated four large PTT-style DPN-100 X.25 
switches, one DPN-50 management switch, spare parts and training. Lastly IBM made new offers to 
support the availability of OSI/SNA software and hardware. In addition IBM offered co-operation with 
their new emerging EASINET initiative. During the May 1988 BOD meeting in Cesme (Turkey), EARN 
officially accepted all three offers, subject to further negotiations. During spring 1988 a new group called 
OSI-TEAM was formed to design a new OSI Migration plan which held several meetings that were 
sponsored by DEC that finally came to a conclusion that we needed some kind of gateways between NJE 
and OSI which we called G-BOXes. At the end it became clear, of course, that such boxes could be made 
from VMS VAXes with DEC OSI/X.25 support and JNET. It (also) became clear that we need to support 
full NJE protocol on the future X.25 network for an interim period and many proposals for that were made. 
SNA/X.25 and NJE/DECNET were discarded since they were proprietary and were not available both for 
IBM and DEC operating systems which were seen as the major operating systems in EARN. The BITNET II 
efforts for developing NJE over TCP/IP were known and were discussed, but since DEC and many others 
insisted that we must use OSI and X.25 and that a EARN wide IP network was politically impossible 
anyway, it wasn’t accepted. Finally, developing a new protocol to carry NJE over OSI session layer was 
seen as the most Open solution for providing NJE connectivity, since it could be implemented on both IBM 
and DEC systems using many real OSI layers and we did have financial and technical support to do it. 
Steve Arnold from Joiner Associates, who had very actively participated in the OSI-TEAM, promised to 
produce a working prototype of NJE/OSI driver in the summer 1988. Implementation for the IBM systems, 
which were called E-BOXes, were also expected to appear soon and maybe even supported by IBM. In the 
meetings other gateway functions were also discussed and the most important ones were mail, file and job 
transfer gateways from NJE to X.400, FTAM and JTM. But since no quick ways to implement this were 
found and the first priority was NJE over X.25 the OSI-TEAM left them for further study.” 
19 Miscellaneous information about the inception of the Internet and related Networking 
Technologies and Infrastructures 
In general, it is much easier to identify the originator(s) of particular networking initiatives 
than the person who is really at the origin of key networking developments such as the Internet or 
the World Wide Web for example, as these is usually the result of distributed team work.

 Two innovative proposals were made regarding NJE: 1) BSC over X.25,  2) TCP/IP 
October 25, 2012 © Copyright 2011-2012, Olivier Martin (ictconsulting) 104 
As written by Robert Cailliau (CERN) in his “A short history of the Web” speech delivered at 
the launching of the European branch of the W3 Consortium in Paris (Nov. 1995) [486]: 
“The history of every great invention is based on a lot of pre-history. In the case of the World-Wide Web, 
there are two lines to be traced: the development of hypertext, or the computer-aided reading of electronic 
documents, and the development of the Internet protocols which made the global network possible….We 
need to make a Web browser for the X system, but have no in-house expertise. However, Viola [487] (UCB 
& O'Reilly Assoc.) and Midas (SLAC) [488] are WYSIWYG [489] implementations that create great 
interest….The world has 50 Web servers! In 1993, Viola and Midas are shown at the Software 
Development Group of NCSA
333
. Marc Andreessen [490] and Eric Bina [491] write Mosaic [274] from 
NCSA. This is easy to install, robust, and allows in-line colour images. This causes an explosion in the 
USA.” 
19.1 Who are the funding “fathers”? 
19.1.1 INTERNET  
As already explained, DARPA was first involved in the research whereas NSF (Stephen Wolff 
[492] and Steve Goldstein [300]) funded the NSFnet infrastructure. 
19.1.2 BITNET 
BITNET was a cooperative USA university network founded in 1981 by Ira Fuchs [493]  
(CUNY
334
) and Greydon Freeman (Yale University). The first network link was between CUNY 
and Yale. BITNET was essentially a clone of IBM’s corporate network VNET [156]. Contrary to 
a common belief, and unlike its European counterpart EARN that was funded by IBM, BITNET 
was essentially self-funded apart from BITNIC
335
 that received IBM funding. 
19.1.3 EARN 
Given the confused situation in Europe, it is definitely hard to imagine how EARN could have 
been started without the significant seed-funding from IBM for a period of years, estimated by 
Frode Greisen to be about 40Million USD. It is equally hard to imagine what would have 
happened in Europe without EARN, most likely an indescribable chaos but who knows! 
19.1.4 EASINET 
Another major initiative of IBM in Europe that had a lasting impact, as explained in chapter 
5.1, and greatly helped the creation of the European Internet. The amount of the 3 years funding 
(1988-1990) regarding the links between the sites participating to the program as well as the T1 
link to NSFnet between CERN and Cornell University is unknown to me. 
19.2 Who are the “founding fathers”? 
As very well explained by Ronda Hauben in [494] “Finding the Founding Fathers of the 
Internet” and Ian Peter in [495] “So, who really did invent the Internet?” is not a trivial matter 
This question is more difficult to answer as “Who invited the World Wide Web”?

However, in both cases there were many external influences (e.g. packet switching in the 
Internet vase, hypertext in the Web case) and more importantly team work.  
Therefore, it is interesting to try to clarify the following two points:  
1. Who was at the origin of the concept(s)? 
2. Who are the person(s) who led the implementation and further development of those 
original concept(s)? 
19.2.1 Packet Switching 
According to the “History of Computers and Computing” [496] three people can be credited as 
inventors of packet-switched networks, thus laying foundations for Internet: Leonard Kleinrock 
[497], Donald Davies [498] and Paul Baran [499]. However, as already mentioned in chapter 2.1, 
the role of Louis Pouzin [22] appears to have been either forgotten or underestimated. 
One of the reasons why packet switching was not welcomed with great enthusiasm was the 
novelty of the concept, but also the fact that this new approach required more compute power 
than circuit switching. His only potential benefit was to optimize the utilization of the 
transmission lines; but, as the computational costs were the dominant factor in the early 1960s, it 
decreased significantly the value of this new technology.  
However, as explained by Larry Roberts [500] in his May 1995 article, “The ARPANET & 
Computer Networks” [501] things changed in the late 1960s thus explaining the growing interest 
for packet switching and X.25 in the 1970-1980s: “from 1969 the cost curves crossed and afterward 
the cost of communications dominated. The composite cost of packet switching thus fell below the cost of 
circuit switching also about 1969 and since then the margin of advantage has quickly widened.” 
Excerpts from [499]: “Baran's work was accepted by the US Air Force for implementation and 
testing, but was neglected. His series of papers and book however then influenced Larry Roberts and 
Leonard Kleinrock to adopt the technology for development of the ARPANET network a few years later. 
Actually the ARPANET was never intended to be a survivable communications network, but some people 
still maintain the myth that it was….So Davies initiated the terms packet and packet switching into the 
network terminology (which is much catchier than Baran's distributed adaptive message block switching). 
Davies had considered many possibilities, block, unit, segment, etc., before deciding on packet as a sort of 
small package. And as he later told Baran: "Well, you may have got there first, but I got the name." 
In the UK it was started at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) under its then Laboratory 
Superintendent Donald Davies and called the NPL Network
336
.  
In France, CYCLADES, a pure datagram network that was deployed from 1971 and remained 
operational till 1979, has already been described in chapter 2.1. As noted by Larry Roberts in 
[501] “The ARPANET also operates using datagrams but perhaps the most avid supporter of the concept 
was the designer of CYCLADES, Louis Pouzin.”. This opinion is also expressed by Vint Cerf in 
chapter 19.2.3.1. 
In Europe, agreement was reached in 1971 to mount an inter-government packet switching 
network trial based on CYCLADES, originally known as the COST11 project and later renamed 
EIN [23], but due to the difficulties of multi-national funding it did not become operational until 
1976. The project was directed by Derek Barber, one of Donald Davies’ colleagues at NPL.

19.2.2 ARPANET 
According to an article [502] published by Louis Pouzin in the French journal “La Recherche” 
[503] titled “Cyclades or how to lose a market”: “The Arpanet is generally considered as the first 
implementation of the packet switching concept, but it is inaccurate: the Tymnet
337
 network [17] [504]and 
that of SITA [250] have been developed simultaneously and on similar concepts.” 
 
Irrespective of the above statement that actually concerns packet switching, it seems 
indisputable that: Larry Roberts is the "father of the ARPANET” as [505] “He earned this nickname 
by directing the team of engineers that created the ARPANET. Roberts was also the principal architect of 
the ARPANET.” 
Adapted excerpts from the “History of Computers and Computing, Internet Birth, Larry 
Roberts” [500] and “The ARPANET & Computer Networks” [501]: 
1. During the 2nd congress on Information on the Information System Science in Nov. 1964, 
Roberts met with J.C.R. Licklider
338
 [506], nicknamed “Lick”, Head of ARPA’s Intergalactic 
Computer Network Group
339
; according to Larry Roberts’ own words he got “infected” by 
Lick’s enthusiasm about computer networks and thus decided to change his carrier. In 1965, he 
attended a seminar at MIT where Donald Davies (NPL) presented a paper
340
 about packet 
switching
341
 as well as PAD
342
 to interface character mode terminals directly to packet 
networks and they exchanged ideas. In return, Donald Davies received a copy of Paul Baran’s 
1964 internal Rand Corporation report titled “On Distributed Communications” that described 
similar ideas. “Lick” left ARPA in 1966 and in only a few years his ideas were implemented 
with the creation of the ARPANET. He was succeeded by Robert Taylor who assumed the 
directorship of ARPA's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO).  
2. In the 1960s, computing costs were very high and demand for additional computing facilities 
was also growing fast. Building on the theoretical legacy of “Lick”, Taylor decided that ARPA 
should link the existing computers at ARPA-funded research institutions together. This would 
allow everybody on the network to share computing resources and results. Having obtained the 
go-ahead to build a network, Taylor began looking for someone to manage the ARPANET 
project and his first choice was a young computer scientist named Larry Roberts that was 
currently working on graphics at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory but also had experience with 
network computing: Larry reluctantly agreed to move to the West coast in 1967 after one year 
of discussions with Taylor! 
3.  So, at age 29, Roberts accepted the position of manager and principal architect of the 
precursor to the Internet. In 1967, he laid out his networking project plans in a meeting with 
ARPA's PI
343
. He wanted to connect all ARPA-sponsored computers directly over dial-up 
telephone lines. Networking functions would be handled by "host" computers at each site. All in 
all the reception to Roberts' plans was a cold one as  many foresaw problems trying to facilitate 
communication between machine with many different incompatible operating systems and 
languages. Instead, a man named Wes Clark [507] handed Roberts a note that read: "You've 
got the network inside out".  Clark suggested instead using small computers at each site to 
handle networking functions. All of the small computers could thus speak the same language 
and each host computer would only need to adapt its language once in communicating with its 
small computer counterpart, which would act as a sort of gateway. The small computers could

also remain under more direct ARPA control than were the large host computers. Roberts 
adopted Clark's idea and called the small computers IMPs
344
. By the middle of 1968, Roberts 
sent out a request for bids to build the IMPs to 140 companies. In late December, the bidding 
was awarded to BBN. In August 1969, they delivered the first IMP to UCLA. A month later, the 
second was delivered to SRI. The two were connected and the ARAPNET was born.  
4. As soon as the first four nodes were brought up and tested in December 1969 the network grew 
very rapidly
345
. By 1971, it was clear that connecting terminals directly to the network through 
a PAD-type device was important. Such a device was designed and built in 1970/1971, and the 
first TIP
346
 was added to the network in Aug 1971. This permitted users with no computer to 
select a computer from all those around the country. In many cases having the user attach his 
terminal to a TIP and access even his own host(s) through the network was found to be more 
reliable. This was the start of a trend which today is almost the rule: workstations should attach 
to a network, not a computer. 
5. The technical and operational success of the ARPANET quickly demonstrated to a generally 
skeptical world that packet switching could be organized to provide an efficient and highly 
responsive interactive data communications facility. Fears that packets would loop forever and 
that very large buffer pools would be required were quickly allayed. The work of Leonard 
Kleinrock and his associates at UCLA on the theory and measurement of the ARPANET has 
been of particular importance in providing a firm theoretical and practical understanding 
about the performance of packet networks.  
6. Roberts left ARPA in 1972 to found Telenet347 on behalf of BBN and was replaced by Robert 
Kahn (BBN) [508].  
ARPANET’s transport protocol was named NCP
348
 [509]. In 1983, the TCP/IP protocols 
replaced NCP as the ARPANET’s principal protocol, and the ARPANET then became one subnet 
of the early Internet. The separation of the network (IP) and the transport (TCP) layers, namely 
the replacement of NCP by TCP/IP, is one of the main differences between ARPANET and 
INTERNET. 
Although, it may seem heretical, I find that ARPANET bears some similarities with X.25 and 
ATM, in terms of PADs and message fragmentation into small packets, whereas, in today’s 
Internet, packet fragmentation is the exception rather than the rule thanks to dynamic MTU
349
 
discovery [510]. Another distinguishing feature was flow control which, in the case of X.25 is 
done at layer 2 (i.e. by the network operator), whereas in datagram networks it is left to the end 
hosts to manage end-to-end flows. Of course, unlike ARPANET that was a pure datagram 
network, X.25 was connection-oriented with virtual circuit set-up; however, most X.25 networks 
were layered over a packet switched network.  This may also explain why Telenet [511], the 
commercial avatar of Arpanet, offered from the start a virtual circuit interface and why Larry 
Roberts was active in the development of the X.25 standard. 
19.2.2.1 Telenet 
Adapted excerpts from L. Roberts’ “The ARPANET & Computer Networks” article [501]:

“By April 1978 Telenet's network had grown to 187 nodes providing service to 180 host computers and 
supporting direct terminal access service in 1.56 cities and interconnections to 14 other countries. Telenet 
was designed from the start to appear to the user as a virtual circuit service with the host interface being 
implemented over a communications line rather than with a box on site. However, for the first several years 
Telenet operated a core network based on datagrams copied from the ARPANET but implemented virtual 
circuits at all interfaces. It wasn't until the complete shift was made to Telenet's TP-4000 packet switch 
around 1980 that the savings of virtual circuits in the core net could be realized (about 30% for Telenet 
with a 32 byte average packet size).”  
19.2.3 INTERNET 
 For the general public, it is Vint Cerf [28] [512] who is widely recognized as the inventor of 
the Internet
350
 whereas the role of his colleagues [513] [514] and, in particular his boss, Bob 
Kahn, is much less known.  
There are many reasons to this, first of all Vint Cerf never stopped his total commitment to 
Internet after he left ARPA in 1976 becoming the 2
nd
 IAB chair [515] from  1989 to 1991 taking 
over from Dave Clark (1981-1989), playing a key role in the formation of ISOC, as explained in a 
joint 1992 article with Bob Kahn and Lyman Chapin “Announcing the Internet Society” [516], 
and ICANN
351
 [517], also leading the Interplanetary Internet effort
352
 [518], being a tireless 
advocate of IPv6, liaising with numerous committees worldwide to promote and/or defend the 
Internet (US congress, FCC, IGF, etc.), in other words being the undisputed “Internet Evangelist” 
as he likes to call himself. 
Vint Cerf is the author of a considerable number of articles and has been the subject of 
numerous interviews, e.g.: 
1. “A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication” (V. CERF, R. KAHN) 1974 
MEMBER, IEEE [519] 
2. “Issues in packet network communications” IEEE Communications 1978 (Cerf, 
Kirstein) [520] 
3. “The day the Internet age began 2009 (40 years ago)” (V. Cerf (2009) [521] 
According to Vint Cerf himself, in an interview [522] with “Government Computer News” in 
January 2006 when he was Chief Internet Evangelist at Google Inc.,  “One thing in particular: I 
can't really be the Father of the Internet because so many people have had key roles to play. Bob Kahn 
actually started the “Internetting” project at DARPA in late 1972 or early 1973 and then invited me to 
work with him on it just after I joined the Stanford faculty. So at most I am 'one of the fathers' of the 
Internet.” 
19.2.3.1 On the design of TCP/IP  
From the very beginning, in accordance with the well-established tradition in the scientific world 
of working in an open and collaborative manner, the scientists involved in the design, testing and 
implementation of new techniques allowing to exchange information between networked 
computers made the results of their work publicly available in the form of IEN
353
 then RFC
354

related IRTF working group.

documents in order to stimulate discussion that proved to be a very effective means of developing 
working Internet protocols far quicker than Standards organizations.  
 
The emerging networking community was well aware of the need to interconnect dissimilar 
networks, i.e. the “Catenet Model for Internetworking” (IEN 48 - 1978) [523]. The term 
"Catenet" [524] was actually introduced by L. Pouzin in 1974 in his early paper on packet 
network interconnection "A Proposal for Interconnecting Packet Switching Networks" presented 
at EUROCOMP, Bronel University in May 1974. 
This story about the design of TCP/IP would not be complete without mentioning the role of 
the INWG
355
 that was formed in 1972 and chaired by Vint Cerf (Stanford University) until 1976 
at the time he joined ARPA. The INWG was subsequently affiliated with IFIP where it became 
IFIP 6.1.  
There is a truly fascinating article titled “INWG and the Conception of the Internet: An 
Eyewitness Account” by Alexander McKenzie (BBN) [525] that terminates by the following 
sentence: “Perhaps the only historical difference that would have occurred if DARPA had switched to the 
INWG 96 protocol is that rather than Cerf and Kahn being routinely cited as “fathers of the Internet,” 
maybe Cerf, Scantlebury (NPL & EIN), Zimmermann (INRIA & CYCLADES), and I would have been.” 
There is also a most interesting interview [526] with Vinton G. Cerf conducted by Judy 
O'Neill from University of Minnesota’s Digital Conservancy (Charles Babbage Institute) in April 
1990, where Vint Cerf credits Hubert Zimmerman, Gerard LeLann and Louis Pouzin (designer of 
the CYCLADES network) with important work on the design of TCP/IP and also tells the XNS 
vs. TCP/IP story.  
Excerpts: “O'NEILL: Was the INWG group responsible for your ideas on the INTERNET? 
CERF: Some of it. In fact several people had a lot of influence on how the design went. Bob Kahn and I 
spent a lot of time working through various concepts and we wrote that paper in 1974. But I had also a lot 
of exposure to Hubert Zimmerman and to Louis Pouzin, both of whom had been doing experiments at 
INRIA on packet switching. They had developed a system they called CYCLADES, and CIGALE, the 
underlying network, was a pure datagram network Anyway, Pouzin's ideas on windowing techniques were 
very appealing to me, and I incorporated them into the initial TCP design. A guy named Gerard Lelann 
was at IRIA working with Pouzin and came to my lab at Stanford for a year and had a lot to do with the 
early discussions of what the TCP would look like. So did Bob Metcalfe (Xerox PARC) [527]. In June of 
1973 we began working together, Lelann, Metcalfe, and I, on the design of the host-to-host protocol for 
INTERNET. Eventually Metcalfe got impatient with the rate at which things were going. I was trying to get 
a large number of people to agree on a set of protocols, and every time you brought in a new player we had 
to go through the argument again. Meanwhile, Metcalfe had five or six guys over at Xerox trying to get the 
local area nets running. Finally they said they didn't want to wait until this process of agreement and 
consensus finally concluded, so they went off on a slightly different tack and invented XNS that took some 
different choices than the TCP did. And they got it up and running before ours, in fact. They kept it secret, 
and that was a mistake, I guess, now looking back. If they hadn't kept it secret, we might all be using XNS 
instead of TCP. But as it stood, TCP turned out to be the open protocol that everybody had a finger in at 
one time or another. That is just how it all worked out.” 
 
Excerpts from nethistory.info [528] (Archives, tcpiptalk) [29]: « Following from feedback from 
Internet pioneer Bob Frankston about the nethistory.info site, the following email exchange with Vint Cerf, 
Bob Frankston and David Reed took place, on the subject of early TCP and IP separation.

Vint Cerf: 
David, I think there is something incorrect about your rendition regarding Louis Pouzin. 
Louis was the datagram guru. The other French guy was Rémi Després [529] and he was the one who 
did RCP
356
 [530] , a predecessor to X.25. The latter was developed jointly by Rémi, Larry Roberts and 
Barry Wessler (Telenet), Dave Horton (Bell/CCG) and John Wedlake (British Telecom). When Larry 
Roberts was building Telenet he asked what protocols to use and I suggested TCP/IP but he rejected that 
claiming he could not sell datagrams and that people would only buy "virtual circuits" (sigh).  
Virtual Circuits were never in Louis' network world - he was all datagrams until you got to the end/end 
transport layer and there he introduced virtual circuits, not unlike TCP over IP. When another of Louis' 
team, Hubert Zimmerman, wrote the first OSI architecture spec, I think he had X.25 in mind as the network 
layer with virtual circuits built in. When I "called him" on it, he said he could not sell datagrams to the rest 
of the OSI community - but thought AFTER he got the X.25-based OSI specs agreed he might be able to get 
people to accept a connectionless addition. Eventually there was a CLNP (connectionless Network 
Protocol) but it was never widely implemented - nor was most of OSI except for X.400 I suppose.” 
 
19.2.4 World Wide Web (WEB) 
Abstract of “How the Web was Born: The Story of the World Wide Web” by James Gillies and 
Robert Cailliau (CERN) [531]  
“In 1994, a computer program called the Mosaic browser transformed the Internet from an academic 
tool into a telecommunications revolution. Now a household name, the World Wide Web is a prominent 
fixture in the modern communications landscape, with tens of thousands of servers providing information 
to millions of users. Few people, however, realize that the Web was born at CERN, the European 
Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva, and that it was invented by an Englishman, Tim Berners-Lee.” 
The story of the Web is actually much simpler than that of the Internet as the leading role of 
Tim Berners-Lee in developing the HTTP [532] and HTML [533] protocols is unanimously 
recognized, however, there were obviously other pioneers, Robert Cailliau (CERN) and Marc 
Andreessen (NCSA). The original versions of HTTP and HTML were not particularly complex, 
what precisely mattered was their simplicity as well as their extensibility.  
Once more the axiom “The simplest ideas are often the best” proved to be right! 
19.2.5 X.25 
X.25 was developed jointly by Rémi Despres, Larry Roberts, Barry Wessler, Dave Horton/and 
John Wedlake under the auspices of the INWG and was first ratified by CCITT in 1976.  
Quoting L. Roberts’ “The ARPANET & Computer Networks” article [501] again: “With five, 
independent, public packet networks under construction in the 1974-1975 period (USA
357
, Canada
358
, 
U.K.
359
, France
360
, Japan
361
), there was strong incentive for the nations to agree on a standard user 
interface to the networks so that host computers would not have unique interfacing jobs in each country. 
Unlike most standards activities, where there is almost no incentive to compromise and agree, carriers in 
separate countries can only benefit from the adoption of a standard since it facilitates network

interconnection and permits easier user attachment. To this end the parties concerned undertook a major 
effort, to agree on the host-network interface during 1975. The result was an agreed protocol, CCITT 
Recommendation X.25, adopted in March 1976.” The X.25 protocol provides for the interleaving of data 
blocks for up to 4095 virtual circuits on a single full-duplex leased line interface to the network, including 
all procedures for call setup and disconnection. A significant feature of this interface, from the carriers' 
point of view, is the inclusion of independent flow control on each virtual circuit (VC); the flow control 
enables the network (and the user) to protect itself from congestion and overflow under all circumstances 
without having to slow down or stop more than one call at a time. In networks like the ARPANET and 
CYCLADES, which do not have this capability, the network must depend on the host (or other networks in 
interconnect cases) to insure that no user submits more data to the network than the network can handle or 
deliver. The only defense the network has without individual VC flow control is to shut off the entire host 
(or Internet) interface. This, of course, can be disastrous to the other users communicating with the 
offending host or network….The March 1976 agreement on X.25 as the technique for public packet 
networks marked the beginning of the second phase of packet switching: large interconnected public 
service networks. In the years since X.25 was adopted, many additional packet standards have been agreed 
on as well. X.28 was added as the standard asynchronous terminal interface and X.29, a protocol used with 
X.25 to specify the packetizing rules for the terminal handler, was adopted as the host control protocol. 
Also, a standard protocol for interconnecting international networks, X.75 has been adopted.”

There is no lack of material on this fundamental technological revolution that brought so many 
changes to the world’s way of living. However, some of the existing material looks too much like 
a hymn to the “heroes/visionaries” that made it happen, which can be slightly disturbing at times.

“aficionados” the “History of International Research Networking” [5] by Howard Davies is an 
absolute “must”, however, it is a rather amazing set of “counter truths” and understatements, in 
particular the decisive role of IBM’s EASInet initiative [6] in the creation of the European 
Research Internet would have deserved to be better recognized as well as the role of the main 
actors, namely,  Alain Auroux, Herb Budd, Stefan Fassbender, Berthold Pasch and Peter Streibelt 
(IBM), Klaus Birkenbihl, Willi Porten and Detlef Straeten (GMD). I must admit that I only 
glanced very briefly through this book as I have no particular interest about the COSINE and 
RARE disaster stories and I also did not want to be influenced by its content knowing, in 
advance, that it was bound to be sheer propaganda to the “glory” of DANTE and to its “great” 
leaders that have been the sole “instigators” of European Research Networking and I must say 
that I was not disappointed at all, in that respect!
