Mobile Communication Networks
Mobile communications networks are getting more and 
more complex with
Variety of services they offer
Variety of devices connected to the network
Variety of environment and channel conditions they work in
Variety of possible interconnections they have to make
and more recently, variety of network topologies they can use
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 4
Communications Technologies
Emergence of several access technologies has resulted 
in a multitude of heterogeneous systems targeting 
different service types, data rates, and users
1G to 2G migration: A transition from analog to digital
2G to 3G evolution: Popularity of Internet and need for higher mobile data 
rates
Complementing service from several access technologies: 
Cellular: 2G (GSM and IS-95), 3G (UMTS and cdma2000)
High speed data networks: IEEE 802.11, HiperLAN

Digital broadcasting systems: DAB, DVB, DMB
The missing bit
A single architecture to integrate all these and future systems, enabling 
users to have global reliable connectivity
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 5
Main Motivations for NGMN
Demand for better availability of services and applications
Global connectivity for any-type services at anytime, anywhere and 
anyhow
Rapid increase in the number of wireless subscribers who want to
make use of the same handheld terminal while roaming
Support for bandwidth intensive applications such as real-time 
multimedia, online games and videoconferencing as well as 
traditional voice service (e.g., through VoIP)
The scalable and distributed next generation mobile network 
architecture is expected to offer any-type services over a diverse set 
of indoor, outdoor, pedestrian, and vehicular 
These services will be offered over a large range of overlapping
access networks that offer different data rates, coverage, bandwidth, 
delay and loss, and other QoS requirements

NGMN’s Inter-Domain Service
Service transition from fixed domain into mobile domain and vice
versa seamlessly
No sensible change of service quality received by a user while 
moving from a fixed domain into a mobile domain
Fixed-to-mobile or mobile-to-fix domain
From one mobile network to another mobile network
Service independency to the radio access technology
No dramatic change in QoS particularly in data rate (i.e., the most humanly 
sensible quality measure)
Logically followed by the delay requirement
Such service availability will need modifications at all layers of the 
network protocol stack
A system of authentication and authorization that supports access 
across different network is also needed
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 15
IP Architecture
If we agree on the assumption that IP will be the core part 
of the next generation mobile networks, then the 
traditional protocol architecture seems to be inadequate
A modular architecture designed based on stack of protocols 
Using services provided by the lower module
Providing new services to the upper layers
Communications mainly between adjacent layers
Physical Access
LLC and MAC
Network (IPv4/IPv6)
Transport (TCP)
Transport (UDP)
RTP
Application
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 16
IP Architecture – Conventional
Link layer (e.g. Ethernet): Providing connectivity to other network 
segments; i.e. not to hosts in different networks
Network layer (e.g. IP): Delivering datagram packets across multiple 
networks
Transport layer 
TCP: Providing connection-oriented communication services, making 
communication reliable, avoiding network congestion
UDP: Providing simple and unreliable transport for quicker 
communications (required for real-time applications)
Where to put the main elements necessary for NGMN?
QoS: So that IP network could be used for voice, video, and other 
multimedia real-time services
Mobility: Among APs of the same technology (micro-mobility) or across 
networks of different technologies (macro-mobility)
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 17
NGMN Protocols Re-Design Need
Physical layer
Multiple physical network interfaces (cellular, W-LAN, WiMax, …)
Link layer
Establishment of concurrent connections via different access networks
Packet scheduling and optimum network selection mechanisms

Faster and easier routing techniques with less signaling 
IP global (and heterogeneous) address translations 
Transport layer

A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 18
IP Architecture – Modified 
Adding mobility features at network layer
Increasing address space and easing routing at IP layer
Modifying TCP for better performance at high error rate 
environments (e.g. over wireless channel)

Protocol Stack Enhancement
Modifications of individual layer protocols so that the 
overall architecture can handle the heterogeneity 
Example: The AdaptNet
Modification of overall protocol stack, removing the 
modularity character from it and allowing interaction of 
protocol layers with layers other than the adjacent one
Example: The Cross-Layer architecture design
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 20
AdaptNet
Making link, transport, and application layers adaptive 
(not changing the network layer) at mobile host
Also inclusion of some cross-layer interactions
Application layer
Handling data and bit error rate fluctuations of the wireless 
channel by means of adaptive source and channel coding
Transport layer
Use of an adaptive mobile-host-centric transport protocol called 
Radial Reception Control Protocol
Link layer
Use of an adaptive MAC for seamless medium access control 
over heterogeneous networks
Use of an adaptive error correction scheme which changes the 
coding rate in accordance with the channel condition
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 21
Cross-Layer Architecture Design
Concept: By leaving protocol stack strictly modular, it 
will be inefficient with respect to performance, QoS, 
and energy consumption, etc.

Coordination Planes
Four separate vertical planes that coordinate the 
information exchange and actions to be done by 
individual layer protocols
QoS: For distribution of QoS requirements and constraints 
and coordination of efforts by layers to achieve QoS
Security: For elimination of encryption duplication at several 
layers
Mobility: Enhancing interactions among TCP, IP, and link 
layers in handling mobility in different environments
Wireless Link Adaptation: Providing adaptive bit error rate 
and data rate depending on different wireless channel 
conditions and different mobile environment
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 23
Cross-Layer Coordination
Cross-layer coordination between different entities within 
the architecture would be necessary in NGMN
For wireless system discovery to provide a list of access networks and 
their associated QoS parameters
To support QoS enabled application, direct communication between
application layer and QoS sub-layer are essential
To provide services in a visited network based on service policy and 
subscriber profiles signaling between mobility management sub-layer 
and services sub-layer as well as between services sub-layer with 
resource management and QoS management sub-layer are essential
When service is no more possible after a vertical handover
Also for accounting purpose using information related to the resources 
used, QoS provided, time and duration of provision of network 
resources, etc

Cross-Layer Coordination Views
Cross-layer coordination not yet standardized
Room for contributions
Will be key to offering enhanced services
Mainly confined to the network level functionalities
Therefore concentric to the network layer in the 
proposed system model
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 27
Broadband Wireless Internet
Implementation of a true Broadband Wireless IP requires 
an efficient integration of heterogeneous BcN elements
The path toward Broadband Wireless IP therefore 
crosses multiple networks with heterogeneous 
characteristics consisting of several technologies with 
multiple configurations consisting of
Cellular based networks (centralized)
Ad hoc networks (decentralized)
Mesh networks (mixed centralized-decentralized)
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 28
Different Topologies
Cellular
In line with current infrastructure and coverage
Ad hoc networks
Distribution of responsibilities of network elements
To add coverage, capacity, and new services for example 
through vehicular communications (VANET)
Wireless Mesh networks
In appose to the existing  star topology of cellular networks
The main limitations of a wireless network is high level of 
transmission power and multipath transmission
Wireless mesh network can remove those limits through
Covering short range, so low power transmission
No ugly towers
Mostly LoS, so no multipath transmission problem
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 29
Challenges
Too much of complexity in the heterogeneous network
Resource management of multiple interconnected 
networks and their topology creation
Traffic management and load balancing/sharing among 
heterogeneous mobile and fixed networks
Network optimization, organization of efficient 
interconnection, and incorporation among multiple 
networks
Biological systems may give some hints toward 
dealing with these challenges …
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 30
Why Seek Inspiration from Biology?
Living organisms are complex adaptive systems
Artificial systems are going in that direction too
Look for new solutions to difficult problems
Life has many self-* features which are also desirable in 
artificial systems: 
Self-organization
Self-adaptation 
Self-healing ability
Self-optimization
Self-robustness
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 31
NGMN and Biological Systems
Heterogeneous networking technologies, devices, and 
services keep changing in NGMN over the time
A centralized control/management tends to be an infeasible 
approach for NGMN
The dynamic NGMN architecture and protocols need to 
have
scalability, self-organization, self-adaptation, and sustainability
By appropriately mapping key biological principles to 
NGMN architectures it is possible to create a scalable, 
self-organizable, self-adaptable, and sustainable network
Such network is motivated by the inspirations from various 
biological systems’ abilities to naturally adapt to the changing 
environment
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 32
The Term “Bio-Inspired”
Bio-inspired demonstrates the strong relation between
A particular system or algorithm
which has been proposed to solve a specific problem
And a biological system
which follows a similar procedure or has similar capabilities
Bio-inspired computing represents a class of algorithms focusing on 
efficient computing
e.g. in optimization processes and pattern recognition
Bio-inspired systems rely on system architectures for massively 
distributed and collaborative systems
e.g. in distributed sensing and exploration
Bio-inspired networking is a class of strategies for efficient and 
scalable networking under uncertain conditions
e.g. in delay tolerant networking
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 33
Biologically Inspired Problem Solving
Typical problems that can be tackled with bio-inspired 
solutions are characterized by the:
Absence of a complete mathematical model
Large number of (inter-dependent) variables
Non-linearity
Combinatorial or extremely vast solution space
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 34
Why Bio-Inspired Networking?
Structural view: communication
is an intrinsic part of an 
organization
Example organizations:
Brain (organization of neurons)
Animal “super organisms”
(ant/bee colonies)
Human society
Those natural and living 
organizations seem better 
organized than the current 
Internet!

A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 37
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)
Mainly rooted on the Darwinian theory of evolution
An EA uses some mechanisms inspired by biological 
evolution
Reproduction, Mutation, Recombination, Selection
EAs represent a set of search techniques used in 
computing to find the solutions to optimization problems
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 38
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs)
EAs can be categorized into the following Classes
Genetic Algorithms (GAs)
Evolution strategies
Evolutionary programming
Genetic programming
Classifier systems
Examples
Simulated annealing
Generic probabilistic meta-algorithm for the global optimization 
problem
Simulated hill-climbing
A mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family 
of local search
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 39
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
A Neural Network is a network of biological neurons
ANNs are non-linear statistical data modelling tools
Used to acquire knowledge from the environment 
(known as self-learning property)
The weights of the neurons are determined in a learning 
process
They can be used to model complex relationships 
between inputs and outputs or to find patterns in data
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 40

Swarm Intelligence (SI)
An Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique based on the 
observations of the collective behavior in decentralized
and self-organized systems
Typically made up of a population of simple agents 
interacting locally with one another and with their 
environment (no centralized control)
Local interactions between autonomously acting agents 
often lead to the emergence of global behavior
Examples: Ant/bee/termite colonies, bird flocking, animal 
herding, bacteria growth, and fish schooling
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 42
SI – Example of Ant Colonies
Ants solve complex tasks by simple local means
Ant productivity is better than the sum of their single 
activities
Ants are “grand masters” in search and exploration
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 43
SI – Example of Ant Colonies
“The emergent collective 
intelligence of groups of simple 
agents.” (Bonabeau)
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 44
SI Properties
Properties of Swarm Intelligence
Agents are assumed to be simple
Indirect agent communication
Global behavior may be emergent
Specific local programming not necessary
Behaviors are robust
Required in unpredictable environments
Individuals are not important
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 45
What is Stigmergy?
Stigmergy is a mechanism of spontaneous, indirect 
coordination between agents or actions, where the trace 
left in the environment by an action stimulates the 
performance of a subsequent action, by the same or a 
different agent
Produces complex, apparently intelligent structures, without 
need for any planning, control, or even communication between 
the agents
supports efficient collaboration between extremely simple 
agents, who lack any memory, intelligence or even awareness of 
each other
Stigmergy is a form of self-organization first observed in 
social insects
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 46
SI Example: Collective Foraging by Ants
Starting from the nest, a random search for the food is 
performed by foraging ants
Pheromone trails are used to identify the path for 
returning to the nest
The significant pheromone concentration produced by 
returning ants marks the shorted path
Nest Food
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 47
Principles of Swarm Intelligence
What makes a Swarm Intelligent system work?
• Positive Feedback • Randomness
• Negative Feedback • Multiple Interactions
Positive Feedback reinforces good solutions
Ants are able to attract more help when a food source is found
More ants on a trail increases pheromone and attracts even 
more ants
Negative Feedback removes bad or old solutions from 
the collective memory
Pheromone decay
Distant food sources are exploited last
Pheromone has less time to decay on closer solutions
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 48
Principles of Swarm Intelligence
Randomness allows new solutions to arise and directs 
current ones
Ant decisions are random
Exploration probability
Food sources are found randomly
Multiple Interactions: No individual can solve a given 
problem. Only through the interaction of many can a 
solution be found
One ant cannot forage for food; pheromone would decay too fast
Many ants are needed to sustain the pheromone trail
More food can be found faster
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 49
SI Routing Overview
Ant-Based Control
Ant Based Control (ABC) is introduced to route calls on a circuit-
switched telephone network. ABC is the first SI routing algorithm 
for telecommunications networks
AntNet
AntNet is introduced to route information in a packet switched 
network
AntNet is related to the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm 
for solving Traveling Salesman type problems
AntHocNet
A MANET routing algorithm based on AntNet which follows a 
reactive routing approach
Termite
Also a MANET routing algorithm
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 50
SI Application in MANET Routing
Routing in MANETs is an extension of Ant Foraging!
Ants looking for food…
Packets looking for destinations…
Can routing be solved with SI?
Can routing be an emergent behavior from the 
interaction of packets?
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 51
Ant-based Task Allocation
Combined task allocation according to ACO paradigm 
has been investigated for MANETs
The proposed architecture for MANETs is completely 
dependant on probabilistic decisions
During the lifetime of the MANETs, nodes adapt the 
probability to execute one task out of a given set
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 52
Bee Colony Optimization (BCO)
The BCO algorithm is inspired by the behavior of a 
honey bee colony in nectar collection
This biologically inspired approach is currently being employed 
to solve continuous optimization problems
training neural networks, job shop scheduling, server optimization
BCO provides a population-based search 
procedure in which individuals called 
foods positions are modified by the 
artificial bees with time and the bee’s aim 
is to discover the places of food sources 
with high nectar amount and finally the 
one with the highest nectar
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 53
Bee Colony Optimization (BCO)
Artificial bees fly around in a multidimensional search space and 
some (employed and onlooker bees) choose food sources 
depending on their experience of and their nest mates, and adjust 
their positions
Some (scouts) fly and choose the food sources randomly without 
using experience
If the nectar amount of a new source is higher than that of the 
previous one in their memory, they memorize the new position and
forget the previous one
Thus, ABC system combines local search methods, carried out by 
employed and onlooker bees, with global search methods, managed 
by onlookers and scouts, attempting to balance exploration and 
exploitation process
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 54
Artificial Immune System (AIS)
Artificial immune systems are computational systems 
inspired by theoretical immunology and observed 
immune functions, principles and models, which are 
applied to complex problem domains
The primary goal of an AIS is to efficiently detect 
changes in the environment from the normal system 
behavior in complex problem domains
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 55
Why the Immune System?
Recognition
Ability to recognize pattern that are different from previously 
known or trained samples, i.e. capability of anomaly detection
Robustness
Tolerance against interference and noise
Diversity

Danger Theory and NGMN
Danger Zone (DZ)
Governed by Lymphotic laws
Distressed cell sends initiation (alarm) 
signal (IS) to its neighborhood
The IS is captured by antigen presenting 
cell (APC) – starts the Danger Theory
Danger Zone (DZ) creation – handle the 
invaders locally
Only cells within the DZ get stimulated

Info Exchange in Cellular Environments
Signaling in biological systems occurs at multiple levels 
and in many shapes
Signaling describes interactions between individual molecules
Main cellular signaling techniques
Intracellular signaling
The information processing capabilities of a single cell
Received information particles initiate complex signaling cascades 
that finally lead to the cellular response
Intercellular signaling
Communication among multiple cells is performed by intercellular
signaling pathways
Objective is to reach appropriate destinations and to induce a 
specific effect at this place
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 62
Intracellular Signaling Pathways
Transfer via 
receptors on cell 
surface
Reorganization of 
intracellular 
structure
After processing 
the information, a 
specific cellular 
answer is initiated
The effect could be 
the submission of a 
molecule

The signal induces a signaling cascade in each target 
cell resulting in a very specific answer which vice versa 
affects neighboring cells

odRemote: A signal is released in the 
blood stream, a medium which carries it 
to distant cells and induces an answer 
in these cells which then passes on the 
information or can activate helper cells 
(e.g. the immune system)

NGMN Developments
Development trend of NGMN and Wireless IP has been 
separated into two distinct ways:
Cellular based – moving from CS to PS and all IP-based
IP-oriented standards oriented around IEEE 802.1x and 802.2x
No matter how these rather exclusive directions develop, the 
future of mobile data will hang around a heterogeneous 
solution that will include both approaches
Providing QoS and security in NGMN and Wireless IP will be 
the task of all layers of the network protocol stack, with 
particular attention at the higher layers in order to be aligned
with the heterogeneous nature of the future networks
Bandwidth and resource management of large number of 
network users will eventually push W-LAN and W-MAN 
standards into licensed spectrum
A. Jamalipour, 2009 Mobile Communications Networks: Evolving through biologically-inspired technologies 74
Bio-Inspiration Role
Very little number of studies on biologically inspired 
network models exist in the literature 
Available models mainly imitate some biological coordination 
aspects
As for the nature, however, they could have great 
potential to assist with better and more efficient network 
management in mobile communications networks, 
particularly for the future dynamic non-centralized 
heterogeneous NGMN environment
To provide scalability, self-organization, self adaptation, 
sustainability, and added network security
