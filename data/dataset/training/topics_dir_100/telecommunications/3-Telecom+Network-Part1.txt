“The Telecommunications and Network Security domain 
encompasses the structures, techniques, transport 
protocols, and security measures used to provide 
integrity, availability, confidentiality, and authentication 
for transmissions over private and public 
communication networks.” 
 
“The candidate is expected to demonstrate an 
understanding of communications and network security 
as it relates to data communications in local area and 
wide area networks, remote access, 
internet/intranet/extranet configurations. Candidates 
should be knowledgeable with network equipment such 
as switches, bridges, and routers, as well as networking 
protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, IPSec,) and VPNs.”

Information Security Concepts 
Security Implementation Principles 
• Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability 
• Need-to-know 
– Users should only have access to 
information (or systems) that enable 
them to perform their assigned job 
functions. 
• Least privilege 
– Users should only have sufficient 
access privilege that allow them to 
perform their assigned work. 
• Separation of duties 
– No person should be responsible for 
completing a task involving sensitive, 
valuable or critical information from the 
beginning to end. 
– No single person should be responsible 
for approving his/her own work. 
Benchmarks and Guidelines:
• NIST National Checklist, DISA STIGs, CIS 
Benchmarks, etc.
Law, Regulations, and Policies:
• FISMA, SOX, GBL, National Security Act, 
USA PATRIOT ACT, etc.

Network Cabling 
• Coaxial Cable 
– Provides a good combination of high bandwidth and 
excellent noise immunity but is more expensive. 
– Two transmission methods are Baseband and 
Broadband. 
• Baseband carries only a single channel. 
• Broadband carries multiple channels, i.e. video, 
voice and data. 
 
• Fiber Optics 
– Fiber optic cable carries signals as light waves creating 
higher transmission speeds and greater distances. 
– Very difficult to tap and is the most resistant to 
interference. 
– Usually reserved for connections between backbone and 
devices in large networks.

RF Network – Spread Spectrum 
• Spread-spectrum is a communication method that 
spreads (or distributes) one or more discrete 
frequencies in time or frequency domains 
• Two types of multiplex methods: 
– Circuit – Constant bandwidth 
– Statistical – Variable bandwidth 
• Two popular methods: 
– Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
– Example: GPS, CDMA, IEEE 802.11b/g 
– Frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) 
– Example: TDMA – GSM, Dynamic TDMA – Bluetooth, IEEE 
802.11a, IEEE 802.16a (WiMax) 
– Note: IEEE 802.11 uses both methods

Physical Layer (Layer 1) + 
RF Network – IEEE 802.11 
• IEEE 802.11a 
– Operates in “open” 5 GHz band 
– Uses a 52-subcarrier orthogonal frequency-division 
multiplexing (OFDM) 
– Maximum data raw of 54 Mbps 
– Usually used as line-of-sight (LOS) RF communication, 
because of poor multi-path capability (5 GHz band) 
 
• IEEE 802.11b/g 
– Operates in “open” but heavily used 2.4 GHz band. (e.g. 
coreless phones, Bluetooth, microwave oven, etc.) 
– Better multi-path capability (i.e. reflection) 
– 802.11b: 11 Mbps and  802.11g: 54 Mbps 
– 802.11b uses Direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS, a 
variation of CDMA) 
– 802.11g uses OFDM, so it’s just as fast as 802.11a

Media Access Control (MAC) 
• Data-Link layer addressing or a physical hardware 
address (MAC) is an unique address that is 
burned into each NIC card by the manufacturer  
– The hardware address is a 48-bit address expressed as 
6 bytes. The first 3 bytes are the vendor code and the 
second 3 bytes are the serial numbers made up by the 
manufacturer 
– MAC sub-layer is responsible for media access.  It 
controls how the workstations communicate over the 
network. 
– There are generally three types of media access.

Media Access Methods 
Three types of media access methods are used by 
packets to access the physical network medium: 
• Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) 
– Carrier Sense: When an internetworking device 
connected to a network. It first checks to make sure the 
network interface has a carrier on which to send its data 
– Multiple Access: All internetworking devices on the 
network are free to use the network whenever they like 
so long as no one else is transmitting 
– With Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) 
– With Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)

CSMA/CD 
• Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision 
Detection (CSMA/CD). 
– Requires that all devices on the LAN listen before they 
transmit. This contention method is often known as 
Ethernet 
– If two devices transmit at the same time,  a collision 
occurs 
– After the collision, devices on the LAN will wait a random 
amount of time before retransmitting data

CSMA/CA 
• Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision 
Avoidance (CSMA/CA) 
– CSMA/CA is a network contention protocol that listens to 
a network in order to avoid collisions 
– Contributes to network traffic because, before any real 
data is transmitted, it has to broadcast a signal onto the 
network in order to listen for collision scenarios and to 
tell other devices not to broadcast 
– Example of CSMA/CA is IEEE 802.11b RF Network

Polling & Token Passing 
• Polling 
– Primary station checks a secondary station regularly at 
predetermined times to see if it has data to transmit.  
– Secondary stations are not permitted to transmit until 
given permission from the primary 
– Used in large mainframe environments 
– Polling is very inexpensive. 
• Token Passing 
– Stations in token passing networks cannot transmit 
unless they receive a special frame called a token.  
– If the node does not have anything to transmit, it passes 
the token to the next station. 
– Token Ring and IEEE 802.5 are examples of token 
passing networks 
– Deterministic, transmission delay predictable, and robust

Wide Area Network (WAN) 
• Circuit Switching 
– Circuit-switching is a type of network switching in 
which a physical path is obtained for and dedicated to 
a single connection between two end-points in the 
network for the duration of the connection 
– Ordinary voice phone service is circuit-switched. 
– The telephone company reserves a specific physical 
path to the number you are calling for the duration of 
your call. During that time, no one else can use the 
physical lines involved

– A device that interprets digital and analog signals, 
enabling data to be transmitted over voice-grade 
telephone lines 
• Channel Service Unit/Digital Service Unit 
(CSU/DSU) 
– A digital-interface device used to connect a router to 
a digital circuit like a T1. The CSU/DSU also 
provides  signal timing for these two devices  
• Multiplexer (MUX) 
– MUX allows more than one signal to be sent out 
simultaneously over a physical circuit 
• WAN Switch 
– An internetworking device used in carrier networks. 
This device typically operates at the data-link layer 
• Access Server 
– A concentration point for dial-in and dial-out 
connections.

WAN Devices 
• Gateway 
– Allow different types of network to communicate 
– Three main types of gateways are: address, protocol, and 
application 
– Example: Gateway between RF and IP, Infrared and IP, etc. 
• Multi-Service Switch 
– Layer 2/3 Devices that provide interoperability between data-link 
and network layers 
– Example:  
• WAN: MPLS (Multi-protocol Label Switching) 
• LAN: RSM (Route/Switch Module) 
• Routers   
– Devices that operate at the network layer of the OSI model 
– A LAN or WAN devices determines the best path to send network 
traffic based on costs and other network information 
– A router also has to share information with other routers.  (Static or 
dynamic routing.)

Data-Link Layer (Layer 2) 
LAN Devices 
• Repeaters (Layer 1) 
– Repeats electrical/radio signals to extend the length of the

• Hubs (Layer 1) 
– Hubs are a central point of connection for cable segments in 
a physical star topology 
• Bridges (Layer 2) 
– Bridges are intermediate systems, or switches, that forward 
MAC frames to destinations based on MAC addresses 
• Switches (Layer 2 + Layer 3) 
– Essentially a multi-port bridges that function at the data link 
layer.  Each port of the switch makes a decision to forward 
data packets to the attached network based on MAC 
addresses that maps to IP Addresses (i.e. ARP Table) 
– Each port on a switch is a separate collision domain 
reducing traffic on the network 
- 61 - 
Data-Link & Network Layers (Layer 2+3) 
Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
• VLANS 
–  VLAN allows ports on a switch to be grouped into single 
broadcast domain.  This allows devices to be logically 
configured as if they are on the same network without regard 
to their physical location 
• Why Use a VLAN? 
– Performance – In networks where traffic consists of a high 
percentage of broadcasts and multicasts, VLAN's can 
reduce the need to send such traffic to unnecessary 
destinations 
– Formation of Virtual Workgroups – contain broadcasts and 
multicasts within the workgroup  
– Simplified Administration – 70% of network costs are a result 
of adds, moves, and changes of users in the network 
– Reduced Costs and Improve Security – Reduces and limits 
broadcasts

Data-Link & Network Layers (Layer 2+3) 
Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) 
• VLAN membership can be classified by port, MAC 
address, and protocol type 
– Membership by Port – The main disadvantage of this 
method is that it does not allow for user mobility. If a user 
moves to a different location away from the assigned VLAN, 
the network manager must reconfigure the VLAN 
– Membership by MAC Address – The main problem with this 
method is that VLAN membership must be assigned initially. 
In networks with thousands of users, this is no easy task 
– Membership by Protocol Type – The network IP subnet 
address can be used to classify VLAN membership users 
can move their workstations without reconfiguring their 
network addresses. The only problem is that it generally 
takes longer to forward packets using Layer 3 information 
than using MAC addresses 
– VLAN membership can also be based on application or 
service, or any combination

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) 
• Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the "next 
generation" protocol designed by the IETF to replace 
the current version Internet Protocol, IP Version 4 
(IPv4) 
– Larger IP Addressing Space.  IPv6 is 128-bit, designed 
primarily to address shortage of IPv4 addresses 
– Auto configuration. With IPv6, a "stateless host auto 
configuration" mechanism is mandatory. This is much 
simpler than IPv4 DHCP 
– Security. With IPv6, IPsec support is mandatory 
– QoS flow label. IPv6 was designed to support for traffic 
engineering like diffserv. or intserv. (RSVP) 
– Multicast. Multicast is mandatory in IPv6. IPv4 uses IGMP 
- 75 -

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) 
• Priority: Enable a source to identify the desired delivery priority 
of the datagram 
• Flow Label: Used by a source to label those products for which 
it requests special handling by the IPv6 router 
• Payload Length: Length of payload (in octets) 
• Next Header: Identifies the type of header immediately following 
the IPv6 header 
• Hop Limit: An 8-bit integer decremented by one by each node 
that forwards the datagram 
• Source & Destination Addresses: 128-bit IP addresses

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) – Addressing 
– The general format for IPv6 global unicast addresses: 
+------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 
|         n bits         |   m bits  |       128-n-m bits         | 
+------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 
| global routing prefix  | subnet ID |       interface ID         | 
+------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+ 
where the global routing prefix is a (typically hierarchically-
structured) value assigned to a site (a cluster of subnets/links), the 
subnet ID is an identifier of a link within the site. 
Address Type Binary Prefix IPv6 Notation 
Unspecified 00…0 (128 bits) ::/128 
Loopback 00…1 (128 bits) ::1/128 
Multicast 11111111 FF00::/8 
Link-Local Unicast 1111111010 FF80::/10 
Global Unicast (everything else) 
- 76 - 
• RFC 4291 specifies the IPv6 addressing architecture 
Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Implementing IPv6 – Compatibility to IPv4 
• IPv6 can be compatible to IPv4 in two ways: 
– IPv4-compatible IPv6 address 
|                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        | 
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------+ 
|0000..............................0000|0000|    IPv4 address     | 
+--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+ 
where the IPv4 address must be a globally unique IPv4 unicast 
address 
 
– IPv4-mapped IPv6 address 
|                80 bits               | 16 |      32 bits        | 
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------+ 
|0000..............................0000|FFFF|    IPv4 address     | 
+--------------------------------------+----+---------------------+

Implementing IPv6 – IPsec  
• IPsec is “mandatory” in IPv6, but biggest implementation 
challenges were: 
– Updating key exchange protocols and ciphers (IKEv2):  
RFC 2409  RFC 4306  RFC 5996 
– Establishing security associations on a “Internet” scale:  
RFC 2401  RFC 4301 
• RFC 5996, Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 
(IKEv2), September 2010 
– Two phase: IKE-SA and Child-SA, to better facilitate IPsec 
deployment 
– IKEv2 is not backward compatible to IKEv1 
• RFC 4301, Security Architecture for IP, December 2005 
– Added Peer Authorization Database (PAD) to provide a link 
between an SA management protocol and the Security Policy 
Database (SPD)

IP Transmission Methods (in IPv4) 
• Unicast: Packet is sent from a 
single source to a single 
destination 
 
• Broadcast: The packet is copied 
and sent to all of the nodes on 
the network 
 
• Multicast: Source packet is 
copied and then sent to a group 
of destinations on a network

• Multicast: A multicast address 
identifies a group of IPv6 
interfaces.  Source packet is 
copied and then sent to a group 
of destinations on a network 
 
• Anycast: An anycast address is 
assigned to multiple interfaces.  
Source packet is delivered to 
the nearest interface.

Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) 
• IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) 
• Created because IPv4 only supports unicast and 
broadcast 
• When a message is sent to a particular multicast 
group, all computers in that group will get a copy of 
the message 
• It is used by hosts to report multicast group members 
to neighboring multicast routers

Routing vs. Routed Protocols 
• Routing Protocols 
– Interior Routing Protocols 
• Routing Information Protocol (RIP) 
• Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) (proprietary to 
Cisco Systems) 
• Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Protocol 
• Integrated IS-IS (ISO 10589 Intermediate system to 
intermediate system) 
• Extended Interior Gateway Routing Protocol 
(EIGRP) (proprietary to Cisco Systems) 
– Exterior Routing Protocols 
• Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 
• Routed Protocols 
– Protocols that are encapsulated within the routing 
protocols and being routed by the routing 
protocols 
• Example: HTTP, FTP, Telnet, SNMP, etc. 
- 84 - 
Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Static Routing 
Routing can be either static or dynamic 
• Static routing is performed using a 
preconfigured routing table which remains 
in effect indefinitely, unless it is changed 
manually by the user 
– This is the most basic form of routing, and it 
usually requires that all machines have statically 
configured addresses.  If there is a change, the 
user must manually alter the routing tables on 
one or more machines to reflect the change in 
network topology or addressing 
– Static routing does not scale well.  Calculation of 
static routing grows exponentially to the number 
of static routes in the route table

Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Dynamic Routing 
• Dynamic routing uses special routing information 
protocols to automatically update the routing table 
with routes known by peer routers 
– These protocols are grouped according to whether they are 
Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP’s) or Exterior Gateway 
Protocols (EGP’s) 
– IGP’s are used to distribute routing information inside of an 
Autonomous System (AS).  An AS is a set of routers inside 
the domain administered by one authority. Examples of 
interior gateway protocols are OSPF and RIP 
– EGP’s are used for inter-AS routing, so that each AS may be 
aware of how to reach others throughout the Internet. 
Examples of exterior gateway protocols are EGP and BGP 
- 86 - 
Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Dynamic Routing – Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP’s) 
• Distance-Vector Routing Protocols 
– Routing Information Protocol version 2 (RIP-2), has  routers 
exchanging routing table information using a distance-vector 
algorithm 
– With RIP, neighboring routers periodically exchange their 
entire routing tables 
– RIP uses hop count as the metric of a path's cost, and a path 
is limited to 15 hops 
– RIP Protocol version 2 is described in RFC2453 
 
 
 
Note: Think “road sign” 
- 87 - 
Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Dynamic Routing – Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP’s) 
• Link-State Routing Protocols 
– Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol is a link state 
routing algorithm that is more robust than RIP 
– OSPF converges faster, scales to larger enterprise networks 
– Requires less network bandwidth. Using OSPF, a router 
broadcasts only changes in its links' status rather than entire 
routing tables 
– OSPF Version 2, is described in RFC 1583, and is rapidly 
replacing RIP in the Internet 
 
 
 
Note: Think “roadmap” 
- 88 - 
Network Layer (Layer 3) 
Dynamic Routing – Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGP) 
• Border Gateway Protocol version 4 (BGP-4) is an 
exterior gateway protocol because it is used to 
provide routing information between Internet routing 
domains (i.e. inter-AS) 
– BGP is a path vector protocol, unlike other distance vector 
protocols, BGP tables store the actual route to the 
destination network 
– BGP-4 also supports policy-based routing, which allows a 
network administrator to create routing policies based on 
political, security, legal, or economic issues rather than 
technical ones

• Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
– Provide reliable data transmission 
– Connection-oriented with flow control 
– Maintains status and state: Stateful 
• User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
– Provide best effort data transmission 
– Connection-less without flow control 
– Does not maintain status and state 
– Does not offer error correction, nor retransmission

Transport Layer (Layer 4) 
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) 
• TCP is a connection-oriented transmission that maintains 
status and state information of each user data stream 
flowing into and out of the TCP module 
– Connection-oriented data management 
– Reliable stream-oriented data transfer 
– Segments are resent if a segment is unrecognizable or is not 
received 
– Connection-oriented protocols are sometimes described as 
stateful because they can keep track of a conversation

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) 
• UDP is a connectionless transmissions do not require 
the receiver to acknowledge receipt of a packet, 
instead the sending device assumes that the packet 
arrived 
– Much faster.  Less overhead than TCP 
– Less reliable.  UDP does not offer error correction, 
retransmission or protection from lost, duplicated, or re-
ordered packets 
– Connectionless protocols are usually described as stateless 
because each end has no protocol-defined way to remember 
where they are in a "conversation" of message exchanges

support orderly data exchange interactions, and to 
release the connection in an orderly manner. 
• Connections: duplex, half-duplex mode 
• Session-connection synchronization 
• (For CISSP…) Examples of Session Layer protocols 
are: 
– Network File System (NFS) 
– Remote Procedure Call (RPC)  
– Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) names

Presentation Layer (Layer 6) 
Presentation Layer ensures that the communications 
passing through are in the appropriate form for the 
recipient. Programs in the presentation layer address three 
aspects of presentation:  
• Syntactical compatibility.  Data coding and conversion 
send from the application layer of one system will be 
readable by the application layer of another system 
• Encapsulation of data into message "envelopes" for 
transmission through the network. (i.e. EBCDIC binary  ASCII.) 
• (For CISSP…) Example of data formats are: 
– ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) 
– EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code) 
– Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) 
– Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 
– Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG)

Application Layer (Layer 7) 
Application Layer provides services for application program 
that ensure that communication is possible. 
• Makes sure that necessary communication resources exist 
• Ensures agreement at both ends about error recovery 
procedures, data integrity, and privacy 
• Determines protocol and data syntax rules at the 
application level 
• (For CISSP…) Example of application services are:
