Preface 
It is essentially axiomatic that modern health care is an information- and knowledge-
intensive enterprise.1  The information collected in health care includes—among other things— 
medical records of individual patients (both paper and electronic, spread across many different 
health care institutions), laboratory test results, information about treatment protocols and drug 
interactions, and a variety of financial and administrative information.  Knowledge resides in the 
published medical literature, in the higher-order cognitive processes of individual clinicians and 
care providers, and in the organizational processes of health care institutions that facilitate the 
provision of care.   
Whereas the practices of 20th century health care were based largely on paper , there is 
now a broad consensus that realizing an improved 21st century vision of health care will require 
intensive use of information technology to acquire, manage, analyze, and disseminate health 
care information and knowledge.  Accordingly, the Administration and Congress have been 
moving to encourage the adoption, connectivity, and interoperability of health care information 
technology.  President George W. Bush has called for nationwide use of electronic medical 
records by 2014,2 and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is involved in 
various aspects of achieving this goal.3 
The National Library of Medicine launched this study to support the engagement of 
individuals from the computer science research community in meeting two challenges posed by 
health care information technology: identifying how today’s computer science-based 
methodologies and approaches might be applied more effectively to health care, and explicating 
how the limitations in these methodologies and approaches might be overcome through 
additional research and development. 
The study described in this report was conducted by an interdisciplinary committee of 
experts in biomedical informatics, computer science and information technology (including 
databases, security, networking, human-computer interaction, and large-scale system 
deployments), and health care providers (e.g., physicians who have worked with information 
technologies).  Appendix A provides brief biographical information on the members and the 
staff of the Committee on Engaging the Computer Science Research Community in Health Care 
Informatics. 
The committee’s work focused primarily on understanding the nature and impact of the 
information technology investments made by major health care institutions.  By design, the 
committee’s effort was both time- and resource-limited, and thus the primary function of this

Pre-publication copy – subject to further editorial correction 
report is to lay the groundwork for future efforts that can explore in a second phase some of 
the identified questions and issues in greater detail.  Perhaps most importantly, this study does 
not touch, except in the most peripheral way, on a myriad of complex social, political, and 
economic issues that complicate the task of health care reform. 
For example, although this report emphasizes the role of the clinician, there are other 
important decision makers in the health care system, including patients, family caregivers, and 
other health care professionals, whose health care information technology needs the report 
addresses only peripherally. Similarly, although the data-gathering efforts of the committee 
were focused primarily on major health care institutions, the majority of health care is delivered 
in small-practice settings (of two to five physicians) that lack significant organizational support.  
These omissions do not diminish the significance of the committee’s efforts and 
recommendations, although they do point to the need for more work to understand health care 
information technology (IT) needs more thoroughly in the areas that the committee did not 
examine carefully. 
Other important issues omitted in this report that are worthy of serious attention in 
follow-on reports include the explicit inclusion of instruction in health/biomedical informatics 
and health care IT in various forms of health care education (e.g., medical and nursing school 
curricula); legal and cultural barriers to sharing information among various care providers; the 
development of a strategic plan or roadmap that articulates the strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats to the development of health care IT; standards-development 
processes in the health care IT industry that might facilitate interoperability; and issues related 
to personal health records for use by patients, the relationship of education in computer science 
to health care and biomedical informatics (and vice versa), and organizational support for 
health care providers that operate on a small scale. 
The evidentiary basis for this study involved several threads.  The primary observational 
evidence was derived from committee site visits to eight medical centers around the country 
(Appendix B provides the agendas for the site visits that the committee conducted).  Obviously, 
a comprehensive view of the current state of the art in the nation’s health care information 
technology cannot be derived from eight site visits—thus, the institutions visited must be 
regarded as a sampling of the state of practice throughout the country.  Care was taken to 
ensure that the site visits were to medical centers that varied along important dimensions: 
governance and ownership (government-operated, non-profit, for-profit), academic and 
community, and in-house technology development and vendor-supplied technology.  The 
centers visited shared one characteristic—for the most part, they were widely acknowledged to 
be leaders in the use of IT for health care.  This choice was made because the committee felt 
that many of the important innovations and achievements for health care IT would be found in 
institutions thought to be leaders in the field. 
The findings from the site visits are presented in Appendix C as a table of observations, 
consequences, and opportunities for action.  The observations are de-identified generalizations 
of detail from multiple sites.  The consequences and opportunities for action reflect the 
committee’s judgment.  In the main text of the committee’s report, observations from site 
visits are cross-referenced where appropriate with the notation CxOy.  Cx refers to Category x 
of the committee’s observations as grouped in Table C.1 (which lists six categories of 
observations), and Oy refers to a particular observation as numbered in Table C.1 (which 
includes a total of 25 observations). 
The findings from the site visits were combined with other evidentiary threads:

•	 Previous work of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the National Academy of 
Engineering. Rather than starting from scratch, the committee adopted as a point of 
departure for its work the IOM series “Crossing the Quality Chasm”—a vision of 21st 
century health care that is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and 
equitable. 
•	 Selective literature review. In many instances in this report, a claim is made that is 
based not on direct observation but rather on one or more papers in the scientific 
literature. 
•	 Committee expertise. The committee included a number of individuals with substantial 
clinical and business expertise in medical centers similar to those visited by the 
committee and other similar settings.  Experiences from these individuals were added to 
this report as needed. 
Eight site visits cannot support development of a statistically significant set of examples 
and illustrations—nevertheless, the committee believes that its observations and conclusions 
meet the more important test of substantive significance, especially since they arose as a result 
of visits to institutions regarded as among the best in the country in applying IT to solve health 
care problems. 
Finally, although the committee’s charge (Box P .1) calls attention to the computer 
science research community, the health/biomedical informatics research community is also a 
key player for doing the necessary research.  The field of health/biomedical informatics 
emerged from medical informatics, which was described in 1990 by Greenes and Shortliffe as 
“the field that concerns itself with the cognitive, information processing, and communication 
tasks of medical practice, education, and research, including the information science and the 
technology to support these tasks.” 4  “Health informatics” and “biomedical informatics” are 
more recent terms that acknowledge the increasing importance of informatics for aspects of 
health beyond medicine and for the basic biological sciences in medicine. 
Computer science as a discipline does not subsume health/biomedical informatics, 
although computer scientists can and do make major contributions to that field.  
Health/biomedical informatics is more than medical computer science, drawing also on the 
decision, cognitive, and information sciences as well as engineering, organizational theory, and 
sociology with a health and biomedical emphasis that is largely lacking in the world of computer 
science research.  In the context of this report, specialists in health/biomedical informatics can 
serve a bridging function between the computer science community and the world of 
biomedicine with which computer science researchers are largely unfamiliar . 
The committee thanks the National Library of Medicine, the National Institute of 
Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, the National Science Foundation, the Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center , Partners HealthCare System, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 
and The Commonwealth Fund for the financial support needed to conduct this study.

Box P.1 Study Statement of Task 
CSTB will conduct a 2-phase study to examine information technology (IT) problems 
faced by the health care system in realizing the emerging vision of patient-centered, evidence-
based, efficient health care using electronic health records and other IT . The study will focus on 
the foundation issue of the electronic health record. 
In phase 1, the committee will conduct a series of site visits to a variety of health care 
delivery sites. A short (roughly 5000 word) phase 1 report, based largely on the site visits, will 
assess the match between today's health information systems and current plans for using 
electronic health records nationwide, identify important information management problems that 
could be solved relatively easily and inexpensively (i.e., where short payback periods and quick 
improvements would be possible) by today's technologies, provide (non-comprehensive) 
illustrations of how today's knowledge about computer science and IT could be used to provide 
immediate short-term benefits to the health care system, and lay out important questions that 
future reports (from this or other studies) should address. 
In phase 2, the committee will prepare a phase 2 report identifying technical areas 
where additional computer science and IT research is needed to further advance the state of 
the art of health care IT; priorities for research that will yield significantly increased medical 
effectiveness or reduced costs; information management problems whose solutions require new 
practices and policies; and public policy questions that need to be resolved to allow such 
research to proceed.  
Both reports are intended to identify technical solutions to advance health care IT , to 
expose the information technology and computer science research communities to important 
technical problems, and to provide a foundation for other studies related to health care 
informatics.

SUMMARY 
BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION 
Health care is an information- and knowledge-intensive enterprise.  In the future, 
health care providers will need to rely increasingly on information technology (IT) to 
acquire, manage, analyze, and disseminate health care information and knowledge.  
Many studies have identified deficiencies in the current health care system, including 
inadequate care, superfluous or incorrect care, immense inefficiencies and hence high 
costs, and inequities in access to care.  In response, federal policy makers have tended 
to focus on the creation and interchange of electronic health information and the use of 
IT as critical infrastructural improvements whose deployments help to address some 
(but by no means all) of these deficiencies. 
Any systematic effort to change the medical and health information management 
paradigm from one based on paper to one based on IT must address two basic 
challenges: using the best technology available today to build and deploy systems in the 
short term and identifying the gaps between the best of today’s technology and what is 
ultimately needed to improve health care.  The first provides opportunities for near-term 
improvement; the second informs basic research and the design of future systems.   
The present study was chartered by the National Library of Medicine to help 
elucidate how the computer science research community can help to meet both of these 
challenges.  Members of this community are familiar with the newest ideas in computer 
science and are thus in a position both to offer insight into how they might apply to the 
health care problems of today and to identify opportunities for new advances.  However , 
the study described in this report was conducted by an interdisciplinary committee of 
experts not only from the computer science community (including members with 
expertise in fields such as databases, security, networking, human-computer interaction, 
and large-scale system deployments), but also from health/biomedical informatics and 
from health care per se (e.g., physicians who have worked with information 
technologies) to provide a suitable grounding in the realities of and thinking in these 
disciplines.   
By design, the effort of the Committee on Engaging the Computer Science 
Research Community in Health Care Informatics was both time- and resource-limited.  
In its work, the committee focused primarily on understanding the nature and impact of 
the IT investments made by major health care institutions.  Thus, this study does not 
touch except in the most peripheral way on a myriad of complex social, political, and 
economic issues that complicate the task of health care reform. 
The evidentiary basis for this study involves several threads.  The primary 
observational evidence was derived from committee site visits to eight medical centers 
around the country—for the most part acknowledged leaders in applying IT to health 
care—on the theory that many of the important innovations and achievements for health 
care IT would be found in such institutions thought to be leaders in the field.  In 
addition, this study built on previous work of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the 
National Academy of Engineering on health care (specifically, the committee adopted as

literature review.   
These multiple sources of evidence—viewed through the lens of the committee’s 
judgment—suggest that current efforts aimed at the nationwide deployment of health 
care IT will not be sufficient to achieve the vision of 21st century health care, and may 
even set back the cause if these efforts continue wholly without change from their 
present course.  Specifically, success in this regard will require greater emphasis on 
providing cognitive support for health care providers and for patients and family 
caregivers on the part of computer science and health/biomedical informatics 
researchers.  Vendors, health care institutions, and government will also have to pay 
attention to cognitive support, which refers to computer-based tools and systems that 
offer clinicians and patients assistance for thinking about and solving problems related 
to specific instances of health care.  This point is the central conclusion of this report.  
HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY 
It is widely recognized that today’s health care fails to deliver the most effective 
care and suffers substantially as a result of medical errors.  In addition, many medical 
interventions undertaken today are in fact not necessary.  These persistent problems do 
not reflect incompetence on the part of health care professionals—rather , they are a 
consequence of the inherent intellectual complexity of health care taken as a whole and 
a medical care environment that has not been adequately structured to help clinicians 
avoid mistakes or to systematically improve their decision making and practice.  
Administrative and organizational fragmentation, together with complex, distributed, and 
unclear authority and responsibility, further complicates the health care environment.   
Many of the relevant factors can be classified largely into three distinct areas: 
the tasks and workflow of health care, the institution and economics of health care, and 
the nature of health care IT as it is currently implemented. 
•	 The tasks and workflow of health care. Health care decisions often require 
reasoning under high degrees of uncertainty about the patient’s medical state 
and the effectiveness of past and future treatments for the particular patient.  
In addition, medical workflows are often complex and non-transparent and are 
characterized by many interruptions, inadequately defined roles and 
responsibilities, poorly kept and managed schedules, and little documentation 
of steps, expectations, and outcomes.  Complex care is increasingly provided 
to patients in a time- and resource-pressured environment because of the 
need to contain costs. 
•	 The institution and economics of health care. The large number of health care 
payers and coverage plans, each with their own rules for coverage, 
complicates administration.  In addition, incentives for payment are often 
distorted or perverse, leading (for example) to more generous compensation

for medical procedures than for communication with patients or for diagnosis 
or preventive care. Patients and providers must also navigate a confusing 
landscape of tertiary care centers, community hospitals, clinics, primary and 
specialist doctors and other providers, payers, health plans, and information 
sources. 
•	 Current implementations of health care IT. Many health care institutions do 
spend considerable money on IT , but the IT is often implemented in systems 
in a monolithic fashion that makes even small changes hard to introduce.  
Furthermore, IT applications appear designed largely to automate tasks or 
business processes.  They are often designed in ways that simply mimic 
existing paper-based forms and provide little support for the cognitive tasks of 
clinicians or the workflow of the people who must actually use the system.  
Moreover , these applications do not take advantage of human-computer 
interaction principles, leading to poor designs that can increase the chance of 
error , add to rather than reduce work, and compound the frustrations of 
executing required tasks.  As a result, these applications sometimes increase 
workload, and they can introduce new forms of error that are difficult to 
detect. 
A number of trends will put additional pressure for change on the health care 
environment.  These trends include an aging population and a corresponding increase in 
the complexity and weight of the disease burden, the emergence of genome-based 
personalized medicine,  a larger role for patients in managing their own health care,  
and yet greater emphasis on efficiency and cost control in health care.  As a result, 
health care processes will become more complex and more time-constrained, and the 
demands placed on care providers will become more intense. 
A VISION FOR 21ST CENTURY HEALTH CARE AND WELLNESS 
The IOM defines health care quality as “the degree to which health services for 
individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are 
consistent with current professional knowledge,” 2 and in recent years, a broad 
consensus has emerged on the future health care environment.  In the words of the 
IOM, health care should be safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and 
equitable.3  Achieving this vision entails many different factors (e.g., systemic changes in 
how to pay for health care, an emphasis on disease prevention rather than disease 
treatment), but none is more important than the effective use of information.

Pre-publication copy – subject to further editorial correction 
The committee identified seven information-intensive aspects of the IOM’s vision 
for 21st century health care:  
•	 Comprehensive data on patients’ conditions, treatments, and outcomes; 
•	 Cognitive support for health care professionals and patients to help integrate 
patient-specific data where possible and account for any uncertainties that 
remain; 
•	 Cognitive support for health care professionals to help integrate evidence-based 
practice guidelines and research results into daily practice; 
•	 Instruments and tools that allow clinicians to manage a portfolio of patients and 
to highlight problems as they arise both for an individual patient and within 
populations; 
•	 Rapid integration of new instrumentation, biological knowledge, treatment 
modalities, and so on into a “learning” health care system that encourages early 
adoption of promising methods but also analyzes all patient experience as 
experimental data; 
•	 Accommodation of growing heterogeneity of locales for provision of care, 

including home instrumentation for monitoring and treatment, lifestyle 

integration, and remote assistance; and  

•	 Empowerment of patients and their families in effective management of health 
care decisions and their implementation, including personal health records, 
education about the individual’s conditions and options, and support of timely 
and focused communication with professional health care providers. 
CROSSING THE HEALTH CARE IT CHASM 
The committee observed a number of success stories in the implementation of 
health care IT .  But although seeing these successes was encouraging, they fall far 
short, even in the aggregate, of what is needed to support the IOM’s vision of quality 
health care. IT-related activities of health professionals observed by the committee in 
these institutions were rarely well integrated into clinical practice.  Health care IT was 
rarely used to provide clinicians with evidence-based decision support and feedback; to 
support data-driven process improvement; or to link clinical care and research.  Health 
care IT rarely provided an integrative view of patient data.  Care providers spent a great 
deal of time in electronically documenting what they did for patients, but these providers 
often said that they were entering the information to comply with regulations or to 
defend against lawsuits, rather than because they expected someone to use it to 
improve clinical care.  Health care IT implementation time lines were often measured in 
decades, and most systems were poorly or incompletely integrated into practice.  Health 
care IT implementation time lines were often measured in decades, and most systems 
were poorly or incompletely integrated into practice.  
Although the use of health care IT is an integral element of health care in the 
21st century, the current focus of the health care IT efforts that the committee observed 
is not sufficient to drive the kind of change in health care that is truly needed.  The 
nation faces a health care IT chasm that is analogous to the quality chasm highlighted 
by the IOM over the past decade.  So that the nation can cross the health care IT

chasm, the committee advocates re-balancing the portfolio of investments in health care 
IT to place a greater emphasis on providing cognitive support for health care providers, 
patients, and family caregivers; observing proven principles for success in designing and 
implementing IT; and accelerating research related to health care in the computer and 
social sciences and in health/biomedical informatics.     
PRINCIPLES FOR SUCCESS 
Change in the health care system can be viewed through two equally important 
lenses—those of evolutionary and of radical change.  Evolutionary change means 
continuous, iterative improvement of existing processes sustained over long periods of 
time. Radical change means qualitatively new ways of conceptualizing and solving 
health and health care problems and revolutionary ways of addressing those problems.  
Any approach to health care IT should enable and anticipate both types of change since 
they work together over time. 
The committee identified five principles related to evolutionary change and four 
related to radical change to guide successful use of health care IT to support a 21st 
century vision of health care.  These principles are elaborated in Chapter 4. 
Principles for Evolutionary Change 
1.	 Focus on improvements in care —technology is secondary. 
2.	 Seek incremental gain from incremental effort. 
3.	 Record available data so that today’s biomedical knowledge can be used to 
interpret the data to drive care, process improvement, and research.   
4.	 Design for human and organizational factors so that social and institutional 
processes will not pose barriers to appropriately taking advantage of technology. 
5.	 Support the cognitive functions of all caregivers, including health professionals, 
patients, and their families. 
Principles for Radical Change 
6.	 Architect information and workflow systems to accommodate disruptive change. 
7. Archive data for subsequent re-interpretation, that is, in anticipation of future 
advances in biomedical knowledge that may change today’s interpretation of 
data and advances in computer science that may provide new ways of extracting 
meaningful and useful knowledge from existing data stores. 
8.	 Seek and develop technologies that identify and eliminate ineffective work 
processes. 
9.	 Seek and develop technologies that clarify the context of data.
RESEARCH CHALLENGES  
There are deep intellectual research challenges at the nexus of health care and 
computer science (and health/biomedical informatics as well).  The committee found it 
useful to conceptualize necessary research efforts along two separate dimensions.  The 
S-5

Pre-publication copy – subject to further editorial correction 
first dimension is the extent to which new fundamental, general-purpose research is 
needed. Some problems in health care can be seen as having solutions on a relatively 
clear path forward from existing technologies (e.g., aggregation of patient health care 
information into a common data repository), whereas others are genuinely advanced 
problems (e.g., aggregation of patient health care information into a trustworthy 
database with explicit representation of uncertainty).  (Also, note that this first 
dimension aligns to a large degree with the evolutionary/radical change dichotomy 
described above, where evolutionary change can be associated with straightforward 
extrapolation of current knowledge and technology, and radical change with problem 
domains that will require successes in fundamental research.) 
A second dimension is the extent to which new research specific to health care 
and biomedicine is needed. This second dimension is rooted in the observation that 
some advances needed for improving health care are general problems in computer 
science (e.g., achieving high availability with low system management overhead), and 
others are highly specific to health care (e.g., developing high-quality devices for 
human-computer interaction that do not inadvertently help to spread infection as care 
providers move from patient to patient).  This distinction is helpful because a broad 
coalition might fund and pursue the former , whereas the latter might be of interest to a 
narrower set in the health and biomedical informatics communities.   
During the committee’s discussions, patient-centered cognitive support emerged 
as an overarching grand research challenge to focus health-related efforts of the 
computer science research community, which can play an important role in helping to 
cross the health care IT chasm.   
An Overarching Research Grand Challenge: Patient-Centered Cognitive 

Support 

Much of health care is transactional—admitting a patient, encountering a patient 
at the bedside or clinic, ordering a drug, interpreting a report, or handing off a patient.  
Yet transactions are only the operational expression of an understanding of the patient 
and a set of goals and plans for that patient. Clinicians have in mind a conceptual 
model of the patient reflecting their understanding of interacting physiological, 
psychological, societal, and other dimensions.  They use new findings—raw data—to 
refine their understanding of the model they are using.  Then, based on medical 
knowledge, medical logic, and mostly heuristic decision making, they make orders 
(transactions) that they hope will improve the condition of or even cure the (real) 
patient. 
Today, clinicians spend a great deal of time and energy searching and sifting 
through raw data about patients and trying to integrate these data with their general 
medical knowledge to form relevant mental abstractions and associations relevant to the 
patient’s situation.  Such sifting efforts force clinicians to devote precious cognitive 
resources to the details of data and make it more likely that they will overlook some 
important higher-order consideration. 
The health care IT systems of today tend to squeeze all cognitive support for the 
clinician through the lens of health care transactions and the related raw data, without 
an underlying representation of a conceptual model for the patient showing how data fit

together and which are important or unimportant.  As a result, an understanding of the 
patient can be lost amidst all the data, all the tests, and all the monitoring equipment.   
In the committee’s vision of patient-centered cognitive support, the clinician 
interacts with models and abstractions of the patient that place the raw data into 
context and synthesize them with medical knowledge in ways that make clinical sense 
for that patient. Raw data are still available, but they are not the direct focus of the 
clinician.  These virtual patient models are the computational counterparts of the 
clinician’s conceptual model of a patient.  They depict and simulate a theory about 
interactions going on in the patient and enable patient-specific parameterization and 
multicomponent alerts.  They build on submodels of biological and physiological systems 
and also of epidemiology that take into account, for example, the local prevalence of 
diseases.  The use of these models to establish clinical context would free the clinician 
from having to make direct sense of raw data, and thus he or she would have a much 
easier time defining, testing, and exploring his/her own working theory.  What links the 
raw data to the abstract models might be called medical logic—that is, computer-based 
tools that examine raw data relevant to a specific patient and suggest their clinical 
implications given the context of the models and abstractions.  Computers can then 
provide decision support—that is, tools that help clinicians decide on a course of action 
in response to an understanding of the patient’s status.  At the same time, although 
clinicians can work with abstractions that keep them from being overwhelmed by data, 
they must also have the ability to access the raw data as needed if they wish to explore 
the presented interpretations and abstractions in greater depth. 
There are many challenging computer science research problems associated with 
this vision.  Future clinician and patient-facing systems would draw on the data, 
information, and knowledge obtained in both patient care and research to provide 
decision support sensitive to workflow and human factors.  The decision support 
systems would explicitly incorporate patient utilities, values, and resource constraints 
(e.g., cost-effectiveness analysis, value of information, and so on).  They would support 
holistic plans, intentions, and multiple decision makers.  They would allow users to 
simulate interventions on the virtual patient before doing them for real.  These decision 
support systems would have transactions built into them to help users carry out orders, 
in contrast to today’s systems in which decision support is commonly an add-on to 
systems and is designed primarily for transaction processing.  Rather than having data 
entered by clinicians into computer systems, the content of clinical interactions would be 
captured in self-documenting environments with little or no additional effort on the part 
of the clinicians.  (That is, an intelligent, sensor-rich environment would monitor clinical 
interactions and reduce sensor input to notes that document the medically significant 
content of those interactions.)   
In addition to the research challenges related to modeling the virtual patient and 
biomedical knowledge, there are probable challenges in modeling and supporting 
multiplayer decision making (e.g., involving family, patient, primary care provider , 
specialist, payer , and so on).  Techniques to interconnect the components are likely to 
be equally challenging.

•	 Modeling. One aspect of the virtual patient involves modeling various 
subsystems within a real patient (e.g., different organs, digestive system, and so 
on) to show how they interact.  One approach to modeling physiological 
subsystems in a specific patient is to appropriately parameterize a generic model 
of those subsystems.  But finding appropriate parameterizations for any given 
model and coupling the different models and the data to drive them pose 
significant intellectual challenges.  For example, coupling models will require a 
computational platform that can support multiple interacting components that 
can be combined into larger and more complex models.  Such a platform must 
not only support parallel operation of the analytical processes but also allow 
assembly of hierarchical simulation and information structures, dynamically built, 
exploited, modified when possible on the basis of empirical data, and abandoned 
when no longer effective.  
•	 Automation. When automated systems are deployed in an operational 
environment, they must work harmoniously with each other .  But in practice, 
because they have been developed in isolation, they do not, with the result that 
they provide contradictory signaling and have different monitoring requirements 
and raise different safety concerns.  Most importantly, they raise issues of trust 
in these systems—excessive trust leads personnel to believe erroneous indicators 
and operations, while inadequate trust forces them to check up on these 
systems, wasting valuable time.  Overcoming these operational integration 
problems for automated systems remains a major challenge. 
•	 Data sharing and collaboration. The data relevant to health care are highly 
heterogeneous.  To exploit such data effectively, users need to be able to ask 
queries that span multiple data sources without requiring the data to be 
standardized or requiring the user to query each single database in isolation.  
Today, data integration usually entails a major and costly effort.  Research 
challenges in this area involve data integration systems that are fundamentally 
easier to use, data integration methodologies that can proceed incrementally 
while remaining compatible with previous versions, and more flexible 
architectures for data sharing and integration.  
•	 Data management at scale. Presuming the existence of large integrated corpora 
of data, another major challenge is in managing those data.  Some of the 
important dimensions of medical information management include annotation 
and metadata, linkage, and privacy.   
•	 Automated full capture of physician-patient interactions. Such capture would 
release clinician time for more productive uses and help to ensure more 
complete and timely patient records. Some of the important dimensions in this 
problem domain include real-time transcription and interpretation of the dialog 
between patient and provider , summarization of physical interactions between 
patient and provider based on the interpretation of images recorded by various 
cameras in the care providing room (subject to appropriate privacy safeguards), 
and correlation of the information contained in the audio and visual transcripts.

Government 
Federal and state governments play important roles as supporters of research, 
payers for health care, and stimulators for education.  The committee believes that 
government institutions—especially the federal government—should explicitly embrace 
measurable health care quality improvement as the driving rationale for its health care 
IT adoption efforts, and should shun programs that focus on promoting the adoption of 
specific clinical applications.  Although this principle should not be taken to discourage 
incentives to invest in infrastructure (networks, workstations, administrative transaction 
processing systems, platforms for data mining, data repositories, and so on) that 
provides a foundation on which other specific clinical applications can be built, a top-
down focus on specific clinical applications is likely to result in a premature “freezing” of 
inefficient workflows and processes and to impede iterative change.   
In focusing on the goal to be achieved, namely better and/or less expensive 
health care, clinicians and other providers will appropriately be drawn to IT only if, 
where, and when it can be shown to enable them to do their jobs more effectively. 
Blanket promotion of IT adoption where benefits are not clear or are oversold— 
especially in a non-infrastructure context—will only waste resources and sour clinicians 
on the true potential of health care IT . 
IT can be a fundamental enabler for both large-scale and small-scale 
improvement efforts. Because many health care groups have capacities for only a few 
large-scale improvement methods at a time, small-scale optimization is an important 
complement. An example of a small-scale optimization would be the use of a guideline 
alert system that enables individual physicians and/or their clinical teams to continually 
target areas of practice for self-improvement on guideline-concordant care. But for the 
most part, the health care IT available in today’s market is not well suited to support 
small-scale optimization, which requires applications that are rapidly customizable in the 
field by end users. Federally inspired or supported initiatives that incentivize health care 
organizations to achieve iterative small-scale optimization and subsequent translation of 
successes to a larger scale are likely to help stimulate the creation of a new market for 
these customizable applications. 
This analysis leads to six important recommendations for the federal 
government: 
•	 Incentivize clinical performance gains rather than acquisition of IT per se.   
•	 Encourage initiatives to empower iterative process improvement and small-
scale optimization.  
•	 Encourage development of standards and measures of health care IT 
performance related to cognitive support for health professionals and patients, 
adaptability to support iterative process improvement, and effective use to 
improve quality.   
•	 Encourage interdisciplinary research in three critical areas: (a) organizational 
systems-level research into the design of health care systems processes and 
workflow; (b) computable knowledge structures and models for medicine 
needed to make sense of available patient data including preferences, health 
behaviors, and so on; and (c) human-computer interaction in a clinical context.

Pre-publication copy – subject to further editorial correction 
•	 Encourage (or at least do not impede) efforts by health care institutions and 
communities to aggregate data about health care people, processes, and 
outcomes from all sources subject to appropriate protection of privacy and 
confidentiality.   
•	 Support additional education and training efforts at the intersection of health 
care, computer science, and health/biomedical informatics.  Current programs 
of the National Library of Medicine and other institutes of the National 
Institutes of Health are exemplars of such support.    
The Computer Science Community 
The computer science community can find deep, meaningful, and fundamental 
intellectual challenges in the health care problem domain (as indicated above).  
Accordingly, the committee believes that the computer science community should: 
•	 Engage as co-equal intellectual partners and collaborators with health care 
practitioners and experts in health/biomedical informatics and other relevant 
disciplines, such as industrial and process engineering and design, in an 
ongoing relationship to understand and solve problems of importance to health 
care. 
•	 Develop institutional mechanisms within academia for rewarding work at the 
health care/computer science interface.   
•	 Support educational and retraining efforts for computer science researchers 
who want to explore research opportunities in health care.   
Health Care Institutions 
The senior management in health care institutions and health care payers have 
often taken the lead in the deployment of IT for health care.  They should:   
•	 Organize incentives, roles, workflow, processes, and supporting infrastructure 
to encourage, support, and respond to opportunities for clinical performance 
gains. 
•	 Balance the institution’s IT portfolio among automation, connectivity, decision 
support, and data-mining capabilities.   
•	 Develop the necessary data infrastructure for health care improvement by 
aggregating data regarding people, processes, and outcomes from all sources. 
•	 Insist that vendors supply IT that permits the separation of data from 
applications and facilitates data transfers to and from other non-vendor 
applications in sharable and generally useful formats.   
•	 Seek IT solutions that yield incremental gains from incremental efforts.

HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY 
Today’s health care fails to deliver the most cost-effective care and suffers 
substantially from medical errors and waste.  One often-cited data point is the 1998 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) estimate that preventable medical errors lead to as many as 
98,000 deaths per year in the United States;1 a more recent paper from 2005 suggests 
that there is still much more work to be done to make significant progress in reducing 
this figure.2  It has been estimated that, on average, Americans receive about half of the 
medical care that is recommended for them.3  Conversely, the available evidence 
suggests that many medical interventions undertaken today are in fact not necessary or 
are recommended without adequate personalization.4 For example, based on an 
analysis of regional disparities in Medicare expenditures, Fisher et al. suggest that the 
United States as a whole could save annually up to 30 percent of Medicare expenditures 
with no compromise in medical outcomes or patient satisfaction;5 if so, resources might 
be freed to implement additional coverage for the uninsured and/or additional best 
practices that are not reflected in today’s health care practices.   
For the most part, these persistent problems do not reflect incompetence on the 
part of health care workers.6  Instead, they are a consequence of the inherent 
intellectual complexity of health care taken as a whole and a medical care environment 
that provides insufficient help for clinicians to avoid mistakes or to inform their decision 
making and practice.  Administrative and organizational fragmentation, together with

complex, distributed, and unclear authority and responsibility, further complicates the 
health care environment. 
Many of the relevant factors can be classified into three distinct areas: the tasks 
and workflow of health care, the institution and economics of health care, and the 
nature of health care IT as it is currently implemented.  (In this report, observations 
from site visits are cross-referenced where appropriate with the notation CxOy.  Cx 
refers to the Category x (1-6) of observation made in Table C.1 (Appendix C), and Oy 
refers by number (1-25) to a particular observation as listed in Table C.1.  
1.1 THE TASKS AND WORKFLOW OF HEALTH CARE 
•	 Health care decisions that require reasoning in the face of uncertainty. Sources 
of uncertainty include biological variability,7 uncertainty about the medications 
that a patient is actually taking because of missing medical records at the point 
of care,8 uncertainty about the effectiveness of past and future treatments for 
the particular patient [C1O1], simple randomness arising from inherently 
stochastic processes, and imperfect models or understanding of causality.  
•	 Complex and non-transparent workflow [C2O6] that is characterized by many 
interruptions [C2O7], inadequately defined roles and responsibilities, poorly 
kept and managed schedules, and little documentation of steps, expectations, 
and outcomes.9 Poor information flow is particularly apparent at the interfaces 
of health care (e.g., when a patient transitions from inpatient to outpatient, 
when nurses change shifts) [C2O5]. 
•	 Increasing complexity of the care provided to patients in a time-pressured 
environment.10  The aging patient population has a growing number of chronic

8 As much as 30 percent of the information an internist needs is often not 
accessible during a patient’s visit because of missing clinical information and missing 
laboratory reports.  See D.G. Covell, G.C. Uman, and P .R. Manning, “Information Needs 
in Office Practice: Are They Being Met?,” Annals of Internal Medicine 103(4):596-599,

disease conditions that must be managed.11  According to Yarnall et al.,12 
managing in accordance with the preventive guidelines relevant to “average” 
adult patients would require an average of approximately 40 minutes per 
patient per year . A typical patient sees his primary care physician only 4 times 
a year for a 15-minute appointment (for a total of 60 minutes of interaction), 
which would leave only 20 minutes per year (60 minutes – 40 minutes) for 
everything other than matters related to the guidelines for preventive care (by 
2030, about half of all Americans will have at least one chronic disease).13 
1.2 THE INSTITUTION AND ECONOMICS OF HEALTH CARE 
•	 A large number of payers for health care, each with their own rules for 
coverage. For example, a large medical center may have to handle the 
complexity associated with managing thousands of different health insurance 
plans.14  A typical family physician or internist in the United States wastes 40 
to 50 minutes each day on dealing with managed care administrative hassles.15

14 Respondents to an informal poll of the ACMI discussion list in June 2008 
indicated that their home institutions (medical centers) often had to cope with many 
dozens of health care payers (usually insurers), each of which had hundreds of different 
plans with different rules for coverage.  (ACMI, the American College of Medical 
Informatics, consists of elected fellows from the United States and abroad who have 
made significant and sustained contributions to the field of medical informatics.)  The 
range reported was from a low of 578 plans to a high in excess of 20,000.

issues that interject themselves directly into the doctor-patient visit, including “restricted 
formularies, limited access to medical specialists, the requirement of prior approvals for 
procedures, unavailable treatments, lengthy appeals processes, and physician payment 
delays.”

•	 Distorted or perverse incentives for payment. For example, as a general rule, 
health care providers are compensated more readily and more generously for 
performing medical procedures than for communication and cognitive work 
such as diagnosis or preventive care.  In many cases, the reimbursement rate 
is higher when patients develop complications rather than when patients 
receive quality care—that is, physicians are generally paid to fix the problems 
their medical care may have caused or did not prevent.16  In addition, the 
current medical care system offers little recognition or reward for coordinating 
care and pays primarily for face-to-face (office) visits.17 
•	 A fragmented and "siloed” environment of health care organizations. Both 
patients and providers must navigate a confusing landscape of tertiary care 
centers, community hospitals, clinics, primary and specialist doctors and other 
providers, payers, health plans, and information sources.18 
•	 Increasing tightness in the health care labor market for certain specialties, 
such as nurses,19 primary care physicians,20 health care paraprofessionals, and 
clinicians with informatics training.  (Health/biomedical informatics training is 
not generally a requirement in most curricula for health care professionals, 
thus contributing to a scarcity of individuals so trained.)

Medicare. Pay-for-performance programs are a notable exception to such perverse 
incentives, although they have not been widely adopted.

1.3	 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS OF HEALTH CARE INFORMATION 
TECHNOLOGY 
•	 Monolithic and “siloed” information technology. Many health care 
organizationss, especially large ones, do spend considerable money on 
information technology (IT), but the IT is implemented in ways that make 
even small improvements hard to introduce [C4O14].  Even across the systems 
within an organization, interoperability is often awkward and slow [C4014, 
C5O21, C5O23].  Information exchange with the information systems of other 
institutions is rare.21 
•	 IT applications that appear designed to automate tasks or business processes 
for administrative efficiency,22 and that provide little support for the cognitive 
tasks of clinicians [C1O4 and confirmed by IOM23]. IT-based systems for 
health care are often designed in ways that simply mimic existing paper-based 
forms and workflow [C1O2, C1O3] and do not take advantage of human-
computer interaction principles [C5O20].  One result is poor system design 
that can increase the chance of error , add to rather than reduce workflow, and 
compound the frustrations of doing the required tasks.  As a result, the 
computer system frequently increases the workload (for example, lack of trust 
in a system may force providers to maintain duplicate paper-based data 
records) and can introduce new forms of error that are difficult to detect.  
Complex policy and implementation issues relating to protecting privacy also 
make automation significantly more difficult. 
1.4 TRENDS 
A number of trends will put additional pressure for change on the health care 
environment.  These trends include an aging population and a corresponding increase in 
the complexity and weight of the disease burden, the emergence of genome-based

and yet greater emphasis on efficiency and cost control in health care.  As a result, 
health care processes will become more complex and more time-constrained, and the 
demands placed on care providers will become more intense. 
1.5 THE LAYOUT OF THIS REPORT 
Chapter 2 reviews the IOM vision of 21st century health care and wellness as the 
appropriate point of departure for the committee’s work.  Chapter 3 describes a chasm 
between current efforts to deploy health care IT and what the committee believes is 
needed to achieve the IOM vision.  Chapter 4 describes the committee’s perspective on 
principles for developing and deploying successful health care IT , with success defined 
as progress toward the IOM vision.  Chapter 5 describes some illustrative research 
challenges for the computer science community that emerge from the IOM vision.  
Chapter 6 presents the committee’s recommendations, based on the results of its study 
for government, for the computer science community, and for health care institutions.

based on genetic profiles as an important step toward the ultimate goal of providing 
individualized treatment guided by genetic information.  See Amy I. Lynch, Eric

A VISION FOR 21st CENTURY HEALTH CARE AND WELLNESS 
The Institute of Medicine (IOM) defines health care quality as “the degree to 
which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired 
health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge,” and in recent 
years, a broad consensus has emerged on the future health care environment.  In the 
words of the IOM, health care should be:1 
•	 Safe—avoiding injuries to patients from the care that is intended to help them. 
•	 Effective—providing services based on scientific knowledge to all who could 
benefit and refraining from providing services to those not likely to benefit, 
avoiding underuse and overuse, respectively. 
•	 Patient-centered—providing care that is respectful of and responsive to individual 
patient preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that patient values guide all 
clinical decisions. 
•	 Timely—reducing waits and sometimes harmful delays for both those who 

receive and those who give care. 

•	 Efficient—avoiding waste, including waste of equipment, supplies, ideas, and 
energy. 
•	 Equitable—providing care that does not vary in quality because of personal 
characteristics such as gender , ethnicity, geographic location, and socioeconomic 
status. 
The IOM vision calls for a health care system that is systematically organized and 
acculturated in ways that make it easy and rewarding for providers and patients to do 
the right thing, at the right time, in the right place, and in the right way.  This vision 
entails many different factors (e.g., systemic changes in paying for health care, an 
emphasis on disease prevention rather than disease treatment).  But none is more 
important than the effective use of information.2

Based on its observations and expertise, the committee identified a number of 
information-intensive aspects of the IOM’s vision for 21st century health care.  Each 
bullet phrase below summarizes one of these important health care IT capabilities, 
followed by an illustrative vignette of what might be possible.  The vignettes (displayed 
in italic type) are not comprehensive (i.e., they do not cover all aspects of the 
capability). 
•	 Comprehensive data on patients’ conditions, treatments, and outcomes. 
A clinician needs to know what medications an elderly, memory-
challenged patient is taking.  Recognizing the important difference 
between medications prescribed and medications taken, the clinician asks 
the patient to bring all of his pill containers, both prescription and over­
the-counter , to the appointment.  She asks the patient to place all of the 
containers on a surface table computer , which automatically identifies the 
medications in each of the containers and counts the number of pills 
remaining in each container .  The pill containers also carry RFID tags, on 
which the initial fill-up quantities of the containers are stored.  The table 
can read these tags, and thereby make an inference about what pills 
were actually taken and provide information about likely compliance with 
a particular medication regime.3 Farther in the future, recognizing the 
differences in how individuals absorb or clear medications from their 
bodies, a blood sample of the patient in question is analyzed with a mass 
spectrometer or other similar device, and the resulting spectrum identifies 
the actual level of all drugs in the patient’s body.  Combined with 
information from the smart table, a profile of the patient’s compliance 
and pharmacokinetics for each drug is generated. The clinical 
significance of the smart medications table and the mass spectrometer is 
that together they help to reduce uncertainty by synthesizing different 
views into the patient’s medication history. 
•	 Cognitive support for health care professionals and patients to help integrate 
patient-specific data where possible and account for any uncertainties that 
remain.4

D.C., 2004, available online at http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309090776. 
3 If purchase history were available to provide information on when the container 
was filled, inferences could be made about the frequency and timing of pill-taking, 
rather than only the total number of pills taken. 
4 In this report, “cognitive support” refers to IT-based tools and systems that 
provide users (clinicians and patients) with the information, abstractions, and models 
needed to achieve the IOM's vision of health care quality.

A primary care clinician needs to monitor a patient’s heart condition.  
Cardiac information is provided to the clinician not in the form of tables of 
numbers or individual EKG plots, but rather as an overlay on a visual 
animated structural model of the patient’s heart (not a generic heart) 
derived from various imaging modalities.  The system displays the 
relevant functional information in summary form and provides an image 
of the heart in operation driven by all of the data that have been 
collected about the patient over time.  Different time scales are available 
for display, and the clinician can display an animated image of the 
patient’s heart in operation as the patient is resting or exerting himself 
(i.e., in near-real time), or track how the structure of the heart has 
changed over the last 2 years using time-lapse-like sequences.  
Functional histories are also available.  Histories are instantly available in 
easy-to-read form, with different parameter histories presented on 
similar-looking charts normalized to z-scores and time scales, showing 
upper and lower “normal” and physiologic bounds.5  The clinician also has 
the ability to drill down to any supporting piece of information that 
underlies the display. The clinical significance of an animated structural 
model is that it drastically reduces the cognitive effort needed for the 
clinician to visualize heart functioning in this particular patient, freeing her 
to use those cognitive resources for other related tasks.  The model also 
helps the patient to understand the medical situation at hand and assists 
both clinician and patient in determining an appropriate course of action.  
•	 Cognitive support for health care professionals to help integrate evidence-based 
practice guidelines and research results into daily practice. 
A primary care clinician has a number of patients with various heart 
conditions.  In order to help stay current with recent literature, he 
subscribes to alerts from the medical literature and learns that a 
particular heart disease guideline has been updated to include a new 
drug that reportedly prevents a difficult and expensive complication.  
After comparing it to other guidelines that he believes to be trustworthy, 
he decides to incorporate this new guideline into his practice.  By clicking 
on a link, the clinician can download the guideline to his system, which 
also searches for and constructs several potential action flowcharts to 
meet the guideline’s goals, based on an internal computable model of 
clinic workflow and resources.  He selects one and his disease 
management dashboards, order sets, and reminder systems are updated.  
(A dashboard is an easily viewed display that summarizes the health

Patient Status,” The Lancet 344(8919):386-389, August 6, 1994, available at

status of multiple patients.) The clinical significance of the literature alert 
system is that it enables the clinician to keep current and to 
systematically translate new knowledge into his practice while enabling 
the clinician and the patient to decide on the appropriate course of 
treatment. 
•	 Instruments and tools that allow providers to manage a portfolio of patients and 
to highlight problems as they arise both within individual patients and 
populations. 
The computer of an outpatient care provider displays the summary health 
status (a “dashboard”) of her 300 diabetic patients with color-codes and 
carefully designed graphical displays for clinical measures of the disease 
(blood sugar levels, A1C counts, and so on) that provide rapid 
assessment, at a glance, of the status of all patients: those who are 
managing illnesses successfully, those requiring intervention, and those 
who are marginal cases.  When a diabetic patient visits her, the system 
reviews applicable guidelines, customizes an order set to the patient’s 
state and insurance plan (e.g., picks the preferred drug from the drug 
class), and reminds the physician to discuss the selected drug with the 
patient. Feedback indicating success is provided when the provider sees 
that the display indicators of her patients show successful management. 
The clinical significance of a summary health status display is that it gives 
the provider prompt feedback about where her attention is most needed 
in time to take corrective action.
•	 Rapid integration of new instrumentation, biological knowledge, treatment 
modalities, and so on, into a “learning” health care system that encourages early 
adoption of promising methods but also analyzes all patient experience as 
experimental data. 
A pediatrician in Los Angeles finds herself working with an ever growing 
set of young patients with severe asthma. A group of them have added 
her to their Facebook page where they run a special widget that shows 
her when and where they did moderate or high physical activity outdoors. 
The application does not rely on self-reporting. Rather , the young people 
run an application on their mobile phones that uploads an SMS message 
containing their current location every 30 seconds to a private account 
where an application processes and summarizes location-activity data 
generated from accelerometers on their phones.  The doctor has recently 
introduced a new feature whereby her patients use special Bluetooth­
equipped inhalers that report via the mobile phone each time the inhaler 
is used. The website then displays when and where they used their 
Bluetooth-enabled inhalers. In addition to viewing trends over time, and 
patterns based on time of year and day of the week, she runs an

application that relates her patient's activity to real-time pollution 
exposure models made available by the city. She uses the data to make a 
case to the city about other possible activity locations (e.g., different 
outdoor parks) and is soon going to enable her patients to sign up for 
automated customized alerts when they are overexerting themselves 
under hazardous environmental conditions.  The clinical significance of an 
automated activity reporting and processing system is that it provides 
reliable data on what patients actually do (rather than what they say they 
do) in a form that is easy to understand, as well as additional detail to 
link to other data sources to clarify patterns, and delivery that is timely 
enough to support real-time feedback in time to change behavior . 
•	 Accommodation of growing heterogeneity of locales for provision of care, 

including home instrumentation for monitoring and treatment, lifestyle 

integration, and remote assistance. 

A diabetic patient wears an active sensor that provides continuous blood-
sugar readings.  When these readings approach levels that indicate that 
actions need to be taken (e.g., taking an insulin shot, eating something), 
the sensor provides an indication to the patient. Acting with the patient’s 
prior consent, if the patient fails to take the necessary action (as would 
be indicated by increasingly dangerous readings), the sensor 
communicates with a cell phone to place a call to an emergency 
caregiver .  Along with the patient’s vital signs and intake information 
(name, present location, and so on), the call also provides a summary of 
the relevant readings so that the caregiver can be dispatched to the site 
of the emergency and be prepared with what action should be taken. 
The clinical significance of an active sensor is that emergency 
intervention can be requested in the absence of patient action, and that 
the emergency response can be provided in advance with information 
that would otherwise have to be gathered immediately upon arrival.
•	 Empowerment of patients and their families in effective management of health 
care decisions and execution, including personal health records (as contrasted to 
medical records held by care providers), education about the individual’s 
conditions and options, and support of timely and focused communication with 
professional health care providers. 
The son of an elderly man hospitalized by a stroke needs to know about 
his father’s medical condition.  Rather than waiting for hours by his 
father’s bedside to intercept a physician on rounds so that he can obtain 
authoritative information, he logs into a secure application that makes his 
father’s electronic health record (EHR) available on the Internet.  But 
since he is not a physician himself, he invokes a data interpretation 
application that examines the data in the EHR and provides in lay

Pre-publication copy – subject to further editorial correction 
language a summary of the important aspects of a patient’s medical 
condition, previously provided treatments, and treatment options under 
consideration.  The application provides an interpretation (and the 
reasoning behind the interpretation) that is comparable to that which an 
experienced clinician could provide.  The clinical significance of an 
automated EHR lay interpretation system is that the family can be kept in 
the decision-making loop, in a culturally sensitive way and on a more 
timely basis than is possible today, and potentially avoid delays often 
involved when families need time to make decisions—since they learn 
relevant facts sooner (perhaps even days sooner), they can start the 
process sooner.  In addition to the data flowing from caregivers, the son 
can also enter information based on his knowledge of his father’s present 
state and medical history, providing caregivers with another source of 
information, and empowering the son to have a greater role in his

CROSSING THE HEALTH CARE IT CHASM
The committee observed a number of success stories in implementation of health 
care information technology (IT).  For example, one organization had implemented a 
pharmacy/medication administration system in what appeared to be an exemplary 
fashion.  Making extensive use of robotics and bar-coding of medication, patients, and 
providers, this organization had implemented procedures and practices that apparently 
reduced error rates in dispensing and administration significantly.  Another organization 
had almost completely transitioned to electronic clinical ordering and documentation in 
both its inpatient and outpatient facilities.  Another had made progress in using 
evidence-based medicine through clinician-customizable order sets to decrease the 
variability of care.  Another had implemented effective data support for management of 
clinical process improvement and was able to support systematic decisions about where 
to focus organizational energy and attention.   
Although seeing these successes was encouraging, in the committee’s judgment 
they fall far short, even in the aggregate, of what is needed to support the Institute of 
Medicine’s (IOM’s) vision of quality health care.  Apart from a few exceptional examples, 
the IT-related activities of health professionals observed by the committee in these 
organizations were not well-integrated into clinical practice [C1O1, C1O2, C1O3, C4O17, 
C5O22, C6O24].  Health care IT was rarely used to provide clinicians with evidence-
based decision support and feedback [C1O4]; to support data-driven process 
improvement [C2O6]; or to link clinical care and research [C2O10].  The committee saw 
virtually no effective computer-based support of an integrative view of patient data 
[C1O1].  Care providers had to flip among many screens and often among many 
systems to access data; in some cases, care providers found it easier to manage patient 
information printed or written on paper . 
A reviewer of this report in draft form noted the non-intuitive behavior of most 
health care IT systems and the training requirements that result from that behavior .   
Hospitals often require 3- or 4-hour training sessions for physicians before they can get 
the user names and passwords for access to new clinical systems.  Yet much of the 
computing software that these people use in other settings (e.g., office software) adopts 
a consistent interface metaphor across applications and adheres to prevailing 
design/interface norms.  As a result, there is much less need for training, and the user 
manual need only be consulted when special questions arise.  In contrast, health care IT 
lacks these characteristics of conventional software packages—a fact that reflects the 
failure of these systems to address some basic human interface considerations. 
The committee also saw little cognitive support for data interpretation, planning, 
or collaboration.  For example, even in situations where different members of the care 
team were physically gathered at the entrance to a patient’s room and looking at 
different aspects of a patient’s case on their individual computers, collaborative

interactions took place via verbal discussion, not directly supported in any way by the 
computer systems, and the discussions were not captured back into the system or 
record (i.e., the valuable high-level abstractions and integration were neither supported 
nor retained for future use).  
Instead, committee members repeatedly observed health care IT focused on 
individual transactions (e.g., medication X is given to the patient at 9:42 p.m., 
laboratory result Y is returned to the physician, and so on) and virtually no attention 
being paid to helping the clinician understand how the voluminous data collected could 
relate to the overall health care status of any individual patient.  Care providers spent a 
great deal of time in electronically documenting what they did for patients [C1O3], but 
these providers often said that they were entering the information to comply with 
regulations or to defend against lawsuits, rather than because they expected someone 
to use it to improve clinical care.   
These shortfalls are not necessarily for lack of investment; although health care 
organizations as a whole spend a relatively smaller percentage of their revenues on IT 
than do other fields such as banking,1 one organization—a major integrated health care 
enterprise with yearly revenue in the billions—that the committee visited had invested 
over a half-billion dollars in IT in the past decade.  The health care organizations visited 
demonstrated both deep and sustained organizational and financial commitment to 
using information technology to improve health care.  Yet their health care IT 
implementation time lines are measured in decades, and it is common to see the 
implementation of a new generation of health care IT begin while rollout of the prior 
generation is still underway [C4O16].  Centralization of management and reduction in 
the number of systems are the predominant method for standardization [C4O15], 
whereas innovation requires systems that can adapt to local needs [C6O25].  System 
response times are often slow and long downtimes are common [C4O18].   
Consistent with many other reports,2 the committee recognizes commitment to 
21st century use of IT in health care as an essential part of achieving the IOM’s vision of 
21st century health care. But health care IT is merely a means to the desired end, 
namely better and/or less expensive health care.  The committee believes that clinicians 
and other providers will, appropriately, be drawn to IT only if, where, and when it can

be shown to enable them to do their jobs more effectively. Blanket promotion of IT 
adoption where benefits are not clear or are oversold will only waste resources and sour 
clinicians on the true potential of health care IT .   
In short, the nation faces a health care IT chasm that is analogous to the quality 
chasm highlighted by the IOM over the past decade.  In the quality domain, various 
improvement efforts have failed to improve health care outcomes, and sometimes even 
done more harm than good.3 Similarly, based on an examination of the multiple sources 
of evidence described above and viewing them through the lens of the committee’s 
judgment, the committee believes that the nation faces the same risk with health care 
IT—that current efforts aimed at the nationwide deployment of health care IT will not be 
sufficient to achieve the vision of 21st century health care, and may even set back the 
cause if these efforts continue wholly without change from their present course.  
Success in this regard will require greater emphasis on the goal of improving health care 
by providing cognitive support for health care providers and even for patients and family 
caregivers on the part of computer science and health/biomedical informatics 
researchers.  Vendors, health care organizations, and government, too, will also have to 
pay greater attention to cognitive support.  This point is the central conclusion 
articulated in this report. 
So that the nation can cross the health care IT chasm, the committee advocates 
re-balancing the portfolio of investments in health care IT; adhering to proven principles 
for success; and accelerating research in computer science, social sciences, and 
health/biomedical informatics (and concomitant education about each field for 
practitioners in the others).     
Motivated by a presentation from Intermountain Healthcare’s Marc Probst, the 
committee found it useful to categorize health care IT into four domains: automation, 
connectivity, decision support, and data-mining capabilities.  See Box 3.1. 
The majority of today’s health care IT is designed to support automation, with 
some investment in supporting connectivity, and little in support of data mining or 
decision support.   Yet the IOM’s vision for 21st century health care expects health care 
IT capable of supporting cognitive activities and a learning health care system.  These 
activities are much more about connectivity, decision support, and data mining than 
they are about automation. The health care IT investment portfolio must be re­
balanced to address this mismatch.

Box 3.1 Four Domains of Information Technology in Health Care 
Motivated by a presentation from Intermountain Healthcare’s Marc Probst, the 
committee found it useful to categorize health care information technology (IT) into four 
domains: 
•	 Automation. Automation is the use of IT to perform tasks that can be repeated 
with little modification—examples include bar code medication administration, 
generation of laboratory results, and issuing invoices for payment.  
•	 Connectivity. Connectivity begins with physical infrastructure—ensuring base­
level electronic connections between various physical facilities so that data can 
be transmitted electronically.  Examples might include high-speed fiber lines and 
routing capabilities throughout a physical plant, wide-area networks, and the 
deployment of wireless infrastructure.  Connectivity includes interfaces that map 
data from one system into another .  At the highest level, connectivity involves 
connecting people to systems and to each other . 
•	 Decision support. Decision support (DS) involves the use of IT-based 
applications to provide information at a high conceptual level to clinicians to 
facilitate or improve decisions made about care.  For example, DS can include 
simple rule-based alerts such as reminders to physicians about possible drug 
interactions when medication orders are entered.   DS can also involve the 
presentation of information to care providers in ways that make it easier for 
them to know how to direct their attention—a “dashboard” indicating patient 
status across an entire ward or for a physician’s 50 sickest patients would be an 
example of DS for presentation.  Finally, DS can also refer to statistical and 
heuristic decision support reflecting an intelligent synthesis of information about 
the patient, information from the care setting, and biomedical knowledge—for 
example, a DS system might recommend a particular antibiotic based on the 
patient’s condition and a database of the recent sensitivity of microorganisms to 
different antibiotics in their hospital.   
•	 Data-mining capabilities.  Data-mining capabilities use knowledge discovery 
techniques to analyze various similar or dissimilar datasets to recognize known or 
unknown relationships.  Data mining converts raw data signals into clinical 
variables and models to provide a rich source for new approaches to evidence-
based medicine and personalized care.  Examples range from identification of a 
marker for breast cancer therapeutic response from microarray data, through 
mining the text literature for little-known drug-drug interactions, to mining 
multimedia electronic health records to identify a patient’s condition from a text 
note or a change in heart size from a sequence of images, and extracting ideas 
or relationships from a recent publication in a leading journal and pushing the 
information to the physicians who are treating patients who may benefit from

PRINCIPLES FOR SUCCESS 
Change in the health care system can take two forms—evolutionary change and 
radical change. In this context, evolutionary change refers to continuous, iterative 
improvement of existing processes, sustained over long periods of time, that does not 
depend strongly on new technological capabilities.  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) 
vision of health care as a “learning system” is one of a system designed to benefit from 
evolutionary change.  By contrast, radical change means new ways of looking at health 
problems and revolutionary new ways of addressing those problems.  Radical change 
often involves a new capability such as the advent of antibiotics in the 1930s and 
developments in genomics and proteomics today.  Some of the automatic data 
recording, use of novel sensors, data mining, and visualization techniques recommended 
in this report fit the radical, revolutionary mode of change. Other committee suggestions 
fit the evolutionary, incremental change mode.  Any approach to health care IT should 
enable and anticipate both types of change since they work together over time. 
Abstracting from its site visit observations, the experience of its members, and 
the extant literature,1 the committee identified principles to guide successful use of 
health care IT to support a 21st century vision of health care.  In most instances, these 
principles are not new—but even “old” principles applied properly in a given field or to a 
given organization can have the impact and significance of new ones.  To place

emphasis on the importance of each, the text below categorizes these principles into 
ones related to evolutionary change and those related to revolutionary change. 
4.1 Evolutionary Change 
4.1.1  Principle 1: Focus on Improvements in Care—Technology Is Secondary 
The most important principle for guiding evolutionary change in health care is to 
focus efforts on achieving the desired improvements in health care rather than on the 
adoption of health care IT as a goal in itself.2 For example, efforts should be structured 
around clear health care goals (such as those described by the IOM criteria), and with a 
transparent understanding of the gap between the existing baseline and goal. Only then 
should there be a focus on process changes needed to close the gap, and an 
identification of what technology if any is needed to enable the process changes.  If 
early experience shows that the gap is not closing, process and technology can be 
adapted until the improvement is achieved.  In this approach, health care IT is selected 
and implemented on an as-needed basis to support iterative improvement, instead of 
being implemented for its own sake at the outset and then potentially becoming a 
constraint rather than a facilitator of iterative improvement. 
4.1.2  Principle 2: Seek Incremental Gain from Incremental Effort 
An important corollary is to engage in a portfolio of activities, starting with ones 
that require modest investment and are likely to return perhaps modest, but short-term, 
visible improvements.  If programs can be structured so that small investments yield 
visible success, stakeholders and the relevant decision makers are more likely to be 
persuaded to continue along such a path.  In contrast, programs that require large initial 
investments of money, effort, and/or time before exhibiting useful results are difficult to 
sustain and are often politically vulnerable.   
4.1.3  Principle 3: Record Available Data So They Can Be Used for Care, 
Process Improvement, and Research 
Systematic improvement of health care is data-driven. Therefore, health care 
providers should aggregate as much data as feasible about people, processes, and 
outcomes from all sources, acknowledging the never-ending challenge of maintaining 
reasonable degrees of patient confidentiality in such a data collection effort.  Of 
potential relevance are data about people (e.g., their medical condition and health 
status, their diet and environmental conditions), processes (e.g., actual health care 
services received, when, and where with detailed process logs), and outcomes (e.g.,

Information Technology: A Few Years of Magical Thinking?,” Health Affairs 27(5):383­

clinical and functional status at multiple points in time in multiple different conditions).  
Even if such collected data cannot immediately be regularized to a common semantic 
standard necessary for full data interoperability, they are still potentially useful for 
incremental care or process improvement and for research—future needs cannot be fully 
foreseen, especially in light of anticipated needs for clinical and environmental data to 
correlate with personalized genomic data. Moreover , systematic advances in process 
improvement and knowledge may require collection of new data types that cannot be 
anticipated today, suggesting the need for a collection infrastructure whose scope can 
be easily expanded. Automatic recording of actions and interactions at the source will 
facilitate data capture and is needed to avoid increasing the workload of caregivers and 
ancillary personnel.
4.1.4  Principle 4: Design for Human and Organization Factors 
Providers of health care IT can design to support people in doing the right 
thing—by providing incentives for and eliminating barriers to doing those things.  
Entirely apart from technology, barriers and incentives can be sociological, 
psychological, emotional, cultural, legal, economic, or organizational.  Human-centered 
design pays attention to all of these factors as they relate to technical function and 
form.  Such work necessarily involves social scientists who understand real human needs 
and capabilities, why people err , where workload considerations are essential, and how 
to develop systems that enhance capabilities, that are understandable with minimal 
training, and that reduce subsidiary task requirements.  The use of health care IT 
designed in the absence of such input may well lead to greater errors, more stress, and 
lower productivity.3  In short, success requires not just technology but also—and 
perhaps more importantly—social and organizational processes to appropriately take 
advantage of technology. 
4.1.5	  Principle 5: Support the Cognitive Functions of All Caregivers, Including 
Health Professionals, Patients, and Their Families 
Organizations investing in health care IT can support the cognitive functions of 
individuals and organizations as they iteratively adapt roles and work processes.  Such 
support includes analysis of data from practice to identify high-priority improvement 
opportunities among populations or work processes, analysis of applicable evidence, 
tools such as order sets for linking evidence into workflow, and aggregation of patient 
data into decision-centric displays.  Importantly, cognitive support needs tend to center 
on high-level decision making (e.g., diagnosis) for populations, patients, or situations, 
3 See, for example, Yong Y . Han et al., “Unexpected Increased Mortality After 
Implementation of a Commercially Sold Computerized Physician Order Entry System,” 
Pediatrics 116(6):1506-1512, December 2005; also, Ross Koppel et al., “Role of 
Computerized Physician Order Entry Systems in Facilitating Medication Errors,” Journal 
of the American Medical Association 293(10):1197-1203, 2005.

and tend to span granular transactional tasks such as test ordering or prescribing. 
Cognitive support is not well served by the task-specific automation systems that make 
up the majority of today’s health care IT .    
4.2 RADICAL CHANGE 
4.2.1	  Principle 6: Architect Information and Workflow Systems to 
Accommodate Disruptive Change 
Organizations should architect health care IT for flexibility to support disruptive 
change rather than to optimize today’s ideas about health care.  It is axiomatic that 
health care will change dramatically into the future.  New knowledge will become 
available—e.g., genomic medicine. Population demographics will change—e.g., more 
people will be elderly, with a correspondingly different emphasis on different kinds of 
care. Care venues will change—e.g., more care will be provided at home, and patients 
will be  required to assume greater responsibilities for care (with the assistance of 
professional care providers).  Policy is likely to change—there will be different payment 
models or reimbursement rates, for example.  Thus, any IT-based infrastructure to 
support today’s health care needs must be designed to accommodate changes in roles 
and process tomorrow—a point suggesting that architectures based on standard 
interconnection protocols are much easier to change in comparison to monolithic, tightly 
integrated all-encompassing systems.  Otherwise, even deployment of health care IT 
successful in solving a problem today could stand in the way of solving tomorrow’s 
challenges.
4.2.2  Principle 7: Archive Data for Subsequent Re-Interpretation 
Vendors of health care IT should provide the capability of recording any data 
collected in their measured, uninterpreted, original form, archiving them as long as 
possible to enable subsequent retrospective views and analyses of those data.4 
Advances in biomedical science and practice will change today’s interpretation of data.  
In addition, advances in computer science and related disciplines will lead to new ways 
to extract meaningful and useful knowledge from existing data stores allowing re­
analysis of pre-existing data to reveal medically significant relationships and correlations 
that are currently unknown.  Perhaps most importantly, the committee believes that the 
availability of large amounts of data is itself a driver for progress likely to inspire 
medically oriented research in machine learning, display technology, data mining, and so 
on. 
4 See, for example, Werner Ceusters and Barry Smith, “Strategies for Referent 
Tracking in Electronic Health Records,” Journal of Biomedical Informatics 39(3):362-378, 
June 2006. Some of the technology issues involved in archiving are discussed in

Archives and Records Administration: Recommendations for Initial Development, The 
National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2003.

4.2.3	  Principle 8: Seek and Develop Technologies that Identify and Eliminate 
Ineffective Work Processes 
Organizations should seek and develop technologies that allow identification and 
elimination of ineffective work processes and replacement with new approaches to 
achieving their purpose.  Automation of work processes developed in an era when paper 
was the medium for communicating and archiving is fraught with cost and unintended 
consequences.  For example, some of the work done within the health care system 
might be accomplished outside health care by providing support for patients to better 
understand their medications and treatment plans.  Redesign of work to take advantage 
of ubiquitous information access and communication may be much more effective than 
automating existing work processes in an attempt to eliminate errors and effort. 
4.2.4	  Principle 9: Seek and Develop Technologies that Clarify the Context of 
Data 
Organizations should seek and develop technologies that present new 
information in the context of other information available about the patient and relevant 
biomedical knowledge.  The combination of new biomedical technologies, together with 
increased access to data through health care IT , is increasingly overwhelming health 
professionals’ ability to make sense of individual findings.  “Alert fatigue” is an example.  
New approaches are needed to present information in context so that patterns and 
choices stand out.

RESEARCH CHALLENGES 
There are deep intellectual challenges where the disciplines of computer science 
and engineering, health/biomedical informatics, related social sciences, information 
technology (IT), and health care overlap.  Indeed, interdisciplinary work will be 
necessary to go beyond incremental improvement of existing health care IT or the 
automation of traditional paper-based workflows. Systematic development of the health 
care IT-related research agenda is beyond the scope of this brief study, but the 
committee offers a framework for organizing such an agenda.   
It is important to distinguish between a solution to a specific problem in the 
health care domain and the technology-related efforts needed to realize it.  The 
committee conceptualized the necessary technology-related efforts with respect to two 
separate dimensions.  The first lies along an axis describing the extent to which new, 
generally applicable research is needed.  A second lies along an axis describing the 
extent to which new research specific to health care and biomedicine is needed.  
Technology-related efforts can thus be separated into four (2 x 2) quadrants, as 
illustrated in Box 5.1.1 
From a research management standpoint, such a clustering is helpful for better 
understanding the parties needed to undertake any given technology-related research 
effort, the likelihood of its success, the timescale needed to achieve success, the 
appropriate funding mechanisms, and other such parameters.  For example, efforts in 
quadrants 1 and 3 might be pursued by computer science researchers working in loose 
cooperation with the health and biomedical informatics communities, whereas efforts in 
quadrants 2 and 4 would require much tighter coordination and cooperation. 
These two dimensions emerge from the observation that health care IT draws on 
classic computer science challenges such as providing high availability with low system 
management overhead [C4O18], high data integrity, and a very high degree of usability.  
Such goals are essential foundations of many IT systems but are especially challenging 
to achieve in the context of health care IT , given the scale and diversity of the health 
care establishment and, in some cases, the need to support a large, broad user base.  
In addition, many benefits of systems often accrue only when they are viewed by 
researchers and caregivers as sufficiently trustworthy to replace older solutions.  At the 
same time, some problems related to health care IT involve solutions that are highly 
1 Conceptually, the segmentation of the domain into these four quadrants is 
quite similar to the division proposed in Donald Stokes, Pasteur's Quadrant: Basic 
Science and Technological Innovation, Brookings Institution Press, Washington, D.C., 
1997.

specific to health care (e.g., developing high-quality devices for human-computer 
interaction [C1O2] that do not inadvertently help to spread infection as care providers 
move from patient to patient).   
As an illustration of how a solution to a major problem in health care might be 
decomposed into a technology-related research agenda, consider that most clinicians 
spend a significant amount of time in documenting the care provided to a patient.2  One 
challenge for health care IT would be the creation of a self-documenting environment in 
which the necessary documentation could be generated with little or no additional effort 
on the part of the clinicians [C5O19] (see Section 5.2.5).  But making progress toward 
this goal calls for efforts in all four quadrants of the matrix shown in Box 5.1. 
The existing technology and general applications of Quadrant 1 provide a clear 
path for indexing voice recordings.  Speech-to-text transcription is a relatively mature 
technology for vocabularies of modest size as indicated by the variety of commercial 
software packages available.  Speaker identification is routinely performed using 
voiceprints of the known participants, the patient typically being the remaining unknown 
speaker during a clinical encounter , and once a voice recording is transcribed to text, 
indexing within a known domain borders on the trivial.  Full-text transcription today has 
relatively high error rates that make it unreliable as a basis for making clinical decisions, 
although as the technology further matures, error rates can be expected to drop.3 
Another general application is information extraction from discourse analysis—a 
computer listening to a dialogue (or examining a transcript) between two people would 
be able to make inferences about the topics under discussion.  Research in this area 
would build on work in computational linguistics that dates to the 1980s.  For deep 
information extraction (e.g., linking the conversations to key terms in the medical 
literature), fundamental research in Quadrant 3 is needed (for example) to understand 
how to relate concepts embedded in the words themselves to the rich store of 
background knowledge about the world that informs everyday discourse. 
As for health-care-specific applications, there is a fairly clear path using existing 
technology to develop systems that support patient-supplied documentation or 
documentation provided by the patient’s support system (e.g., family), which would 
increase the continuity and richness of information available for the clinician, as well as 
being helpful in dealing with expected future burdens on patients to manage their own 
2 The committee noted this point in its site visits. And the literature has 
important examples as well.  For instance, a survey of more than 2500 clinical 
oncologists showed that the amount of time they spend filling out paperwork and 
documenting patient care has increased more than fourfold over the past 25 years.  See 
S. Mayor , “U.S. Cancer Care Is Worse Due to More Paperwork,” British Medical Journal
322(7296):1201, 2001. 
3 To be sure, claims regarding the impending maturity of speech recognition 
have been made for a long time, but as with user customization of interfaces (Footnote 
22), speech recognition is another example of an idea that was difficult to implement 
with the technology of 20 years ago but now is much more feasible with today’s 
technology and just as important today to pursue.

care outside traditional health care organizations; this research agenda would fit into 
Quadrant 2.  On the other hand, a system to provide a patient or caregivers with 
interactive explanations of a disease, particularized by the patient’s culture, learning 
style, value system, education, and life experience, remains beyond the current state of 
today’s science and would fit into Quadrant 4.   
Other examples of technology-related research efforts in each of the four 
quadrants are provided below: 
•	 Quadrant 1 (General—applied efforts). Adaptation of existing IT and process 
solutions from other domains and industries, e.g., process and data integration 
technologies, human-computer interaction technologies, ubiquitous networking 
technologies, security, search, blogging, and social networking. 
•	 Quadrant 2 (Health care—applied efforts). Identification of the best examples of 
coupled health care improvement and health care IT that have been successfully 
deployed or prototyped, followed by wide deployment of those examples.  Use of 
existing data and process standards to obtain low-hanging fruit, e.g., portals, 
electronic messaging, disease management dashboards, decision support and 
reminders, process automation, and so on. 
•	 Quadrant 3 (General—advanced efforts). Invention of new information 
technologies that are needed in health care, such as ontology management, 
systems that help to explain why decisions are made, large-scale machine 
learning, voice technologies, natural language processing, privacy management for 
access and data mining, and so on. 
•	 Quadrant 4 (Health care—advanced efforts). Specific advanced work on advanced 
ontologies and reasoning in the medical domain, modeling of the human body and 
the virtual patient, interpretation of medical information to different communities, 
approaches to learning and improving data quality, aggregation of patient health 
care information into a trustworthy database with explicit representation of 
uncertainty [C4O17, C5O23]), and so on. 
5.1	 AN OVERARCHING RESEARCH GRAND CHALLENGE: PATIENT­
CENTERED COGNITIVE SUPPORT 
Patient-centered cognitive support emerged as an overarching grand research 
challenge during the committee’s discussions.  This section discusses how a research 
agenda might be assembled, together with representative research challenges, to 
illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity. 
Much of health care is transactional—admitting a patient, encountering a patient 
at the bedside or clinic, ordering a drug, interpreting a report, or handing off a patient.  
Yet transactions are only the operational expression of an understanding of the patient

and a set of goals and plans for that patient. Clinicians have a “virtual patient” in 
mind—a conceptual model of the patient reflecting their understanding of interacting 
physiological, psychological, societal, and other dimensions.  They use new findings— 
raw data—to refine their understanding of their virtual patient.  Then, based on medical 
knowledge, medical logic, and mostly heuristic decision making, they formulate a plan, 
expressed as an order (transaction), to try to change the (real) patient for the better .   
Today, clinicians spend a great deal of time and energy searching and sifting 
through raw data about patients and trying to integrate the data with their general 
medical knowledge to form relevant mental abstractions and associations relevant to the 
patient’s situation.  As reported by Kushniruk, decision making by health care 
professionals is often complicated by the need to integrate ill-structured, uncertain, and 
potentially conflicting information from various sources.4  These various sources include 
but are not limited to myriad journal articles; memories from personal clinical 
experience; clinical guidelines; medical records from a host of providers (often working 
for different health care organizations); informal observations and thoughts from 
colleagues; and patient commentary and insights.  Efforts to sift the data from this 
collection of sources force clinicians to devote precious cognitive resources to the details 
of data and make it more likely that they will overlook some important higher-order 
consideration. 
The health care IT systems of today tend not to provide assistance with this 
sifting task.  Rather , they squeeze all cognitive support for the clinician through the lens 
of health care transactions and the related raw data, without an underlying 
representation of a conceptual model for the patient showing how data fit together and 
which data are important or unimportant.  There is little or no cognitive support for 
clinicians to reason on their “virtual patient.”  So the health care IT systems force 
clinicians to a transactional view of the raw data. As a result, an understanding of the 
patient can be lost amidst all the data, all the tests, and all the monitoring equipment.   
In the committee’s vision of patient-centered cognitive support, the clinician 
interacts with models and abstractions of the patient that place the raw data into 
context and synthesize them with medical knowledge in ways that make clinical sense 
for that patient.5  Raw data are still available, but they are not the direct focus of the 
clinician.  These virtual patient models are the computational counterparts of the 
clinician’s conceptual model of a patient.  They depict and simulate the clinician’s 
working theory about interactions going on in the patient and enable patient-specific 
parameterization and multicomponent alerts.  They build on submodels of biological and

5 The notion of putting individual medical facts into an appropriate context is not 
new, having been described in the literature as early as 1969 (Lawrence L. Weed, 
Medical Records, Medical Education and Patient Care, Case Western Reserve University 
Press, 1969).  Nevertheless, IT has progressed a long way since then, providing a more 
suitable medium in which to implement such a notion.

physiological systems and also exploit epidemiological models that take into account the 
local prevalence of diseases.  The availability of these models would free clinicians from 
having to scan raw data, and thus they would have a much easier time defining, testing, 
and exploring their own working theories.  What links the raw data to the abstract 
models might be called medical logic—that is, computer-based tools examine raw data 
relevant to a specific patient and suggest their clinical implications given the context of 
the models and abstractions.  Computers can then provide decision support—that is, 
tools that help clinicians decide on a course of action in response to an understanding of 
the patient’s status.  At any time, clinicians have the ability to access the raw data as 
needed if they wish to explore the presented interpretations and abstractions in greater 
depth. 
One possible framework for future health care IT is depicted in Figure 5.1.  This 
framework, which emerged over the course of the committee’s discussions and contrasts 
with the limited focus of today’s health care IT , represents an all-encompassing view of 
components and interactions among components needed to support the IOM’s vision of 
21st century health care. 
The left side of Figure 5.1 concerns patient care.  Raw data about a patient (the 
electronic health record) constitute the foundational base.  Next come the transactional 
systems that both produce and use raw data as health care is provided.  These two 
components make up the majority of today’s health care IT .  Above them, the 
committee envisions a computational model of the virtual patient.   
The right side of Figure 5.1 represents biomedical science and research and its 
integral role in health care.  Again, raw research data about biological and medical 
phenomena are at the base. Clinical research transactional systems add to and use raw 
data during the process of executing or running clinical research protocols. At 
the top are the models and abstractions that constitute biomedical knowledge.  The 
thread connecting the top three components is what might be called medical logic.  
Mapping from medical logic to cognitive decision support is the process of applying 
general knowledge to a care process and then to a specific patient and his or her 
medical condition(s).  This mapping involves workflow modeling and support, usability, 
cognitive support, and computer-supported cooperative work and is influenced by many 
non-medical factors, such as resource constraints (cost-effectiveness analysis, value of 
information), patient values and preferences, cost, time, and so on. 
Future clinician and patient-facing systems would draw on the data, information, 
and knowledge obtained in both patient care and research to provide decision support 
sensitive to workflow and human factors.  The decision support systems would explicitly 
incorporate patient utilities, values, and resource constraints such as those mentioned 
above. They would support holistic plans and would allow users to simulate 
interventions on the virtual patient before doing them for real.  To carry out orders, 
clinicians would use transactional systems like today’s, but built into the decision support 
system rather than the other way around.  In today’s systems, decision support is 
commonly an add-on to systems designed primarily for transaction processing and does 
not benefit directly from results of data mining.  Rather than having data entered by 
clinicians into computer systems, the content of clinical interactions would be captured 
in self-documenting environments with little or no additional effort on the part of the

clinicians.  (That is, an intelligent, sensor-rich environment would monitor clinical 
interactions and reduce sensor input to notes that document the medically significant 
content of those interactions.)   
In addition to the research challenges related to modeling the virtual patient and 
biomedical knowledge are the challenges in modeling and supporting multiparty decision 
making (that is, medical decisions made by family, patient, primary care provider , 
specialist, payer , and so on).  Techniques to interconnect the components are likely to 
be equally challenging (see, for example, the discussions in Sections 5.2.3 and 5.2.4 on 
data integration and data management). 
Box 5.2 describes some of the technical research challenges for patient-centered 
cognitive support organized by quadrant. 
On the non-technical side, a variety of questions arise as to how the use of 
clinically oriented systems such as those described above might fit into the actual 
workflow of a health care organization.  How would such support fit into the work 
patterns of future clinicians?  What would the impact be on their work efficiency?  How 
and under what circumstances would clinicians trust the output of these systems?  How 
would responsibility for clinical error be apportioned given the integrative functions of 
these systems?  A failure to answer such questions adequately may well impede clinician 
acceptance of new approaches, even if the technical challenges can be overcome.   
The committee’s vision for patient-centered cognitive support is not wholly new.  
Indeed, development of IT-based tools that examine raw data relevant to a specific 
patient and suggest their clinical implications was the focus of a great deal of medical 
expert system work a number of decades ago.6  Similarly, biomedical informaticians 
have worked for decades on the problem of how best to summarize and present data 
using visual methods, a point of special import in the setting of hospital intensive care 
units, where multiple streams of real-time data can be overwhelming.  Much of that 
research also had to deal with issues of acceptance by ICU clinicians and with trust of 
the technology.7  And the importance of connecting biological knowledge to clinical 
6 One of the primary lessons from this work was that although well-designed 
medical expert systems did have potential to improve clinical diagnoses and 
recommendations for treatment, many other issues needed to be addressed before they 
were ready for “prime-time” application.  In addition, much of the early work on medical 
expert systems focused on relatively small problem domains, whereas the overarching 
medical context for improving health care involves the large problem domain of how all 
of the patient’s data and problems fit together .

applications has been given new emphasis by a recent focus on translational research by 
the National Institutes of Health.8  Nevertheless, the committee believes both that new 
challenges have indeed emerged and that many “old” problems have proven more 
difficult to address effectively than was first appreciated.  Advances in IT such as the 
World Wide Web and ubiquitous computing challenge the health care IT community to 
think differently about how to exploit IT for health care purposes.   
A final and significant benefit for the committee’s vision of patient-centered 
cognitive support is that patients themselves should be able to make use of tools 
designed with such support in mind.  That is, entirely apart from being useful for 
clinicians, tools and technologies for patient-centered cognitive support should also be 
able to provide value for patients who wish to understand their own medical conditions 
more completely and thoroughly.  Obviously, different interfaces would be required 
(e.g., interfaces that translate medical jargon into lay language)—but the underlying 
tools for medical data integration, modeling, and abstraction designed for patient-
centered cognitive support are likely to be the same in any system for lay end users 
(i.e., patients). 
5.2 OTHER REPRESENTATIVE RESEARCH CHALLENGES 
In addition to patient-centered cognitive support, there are for the computer 
science community many other interesting research challenges relevant to health care.  
Several examples are provided to illustrate this main point, but there are indeed many 
more that are not covered in this report. 
5.2.1 Modeling 
 One aspect of the “virtual patient” in Section 5.1 involves modeling various 
subsystems within a real patient (e.g., different organs, digestive system, and so on) to 
show how they interact.9  Such models might operate on different or variable time 
scales—a model focusing on the absorption of nutrients through the digestive system 
might operate on a time scale of hours, whereas a model focusing on skeletal health,

fidelity computational model of a human being that would respond realistically to various 
stimuli is not new.  See, for example, "The Virtual Human Project: An Idea Whose Time

calcium depletion, osteoporosis, or particular bones might operate over years.  Similarly, 
some models might represent molecular interactions, and others might represent 
particular cells, organs, or organisms.   
To first order , the physiological subsystems of all human beings are identical.  
Thus, a sensible approach to modeling subsystems in a specific patient is to 
appropriately parameterize a generic model of those subsystems.  But finding 
appropriate parameterizations for any given model and coupling the different models 
and the data to drive them pose significant intellectual challenges.  Some insight into 
model interoperability can be gained through the use of ad hoc techniques (e.g., XML-
based mash-ups used in Web 2.0 applications) or through other existing component 
frameworks, but the overall problem of model interoperability for health care purposes is 
vastly more complex than applications that have been tackled before.  
Progress is being made in understanding specific metabolic pathways.10  The 
effects of a medication, as well as of some other treatments, are candidates for 
modeling.  Such models will still require many of the parameters used to manage and 
classify the data.11  Genetic makeup, including the capability to produce pathway-
controlling enzymes, is one of the most challenging aspects of making such simulations 
relevant. 
Coupling models will require a computational platform that can support multiple 
interacting components that can be combined into larger and more complex models.  
Such a platform must not only support parallel operation of the analytical processes but 
also allow assembly of hierarchical simulation and information structures, dynamically 
built, exploited, modified when possible on the basis of individual patient data and 
statistical aggregates thereof, and abandoned when no longer effective. At the 
supporting levels, multiple processing alternatives will exist.  Specific, detailed 
simulations will provide the most specific and current results.  Cached results can greatly 
reduce the computational effort for repeated sub-analyses.  Where no analytical 
methods exist, results from biological or clinical trials or clinician assessments can be 
provided. Search and interpretation can provide yet another set of inputs.  Being able to 
operate with a variety of computational paradigms in one setting can greatly enhance 
collaboration among communities that have similar objectives but that now ignore each 
other .  Yet another challenge in modeling is building multilevel models that can 
successfully couple highly detailed physiologic models to the much looser clinical 
“models” that typically are based more on phenomenological relationships than on true 
underlying causes. 
Finally, keeping records of predictions and actual patient outcomes will allow 
incremental tuning of the approach.  It will take much experience as well as careful 
approaches to do so in a way that converges on a stable and more optimal outcome. 
The actual determination of patient treatment will remain in the hands and minds of the

models, and their processing to an interactive care setting is essential to extract value 
out of the many technology investments that are in process or being planned.  
Box 5.3 describes some of the technical research challenges for modeling 
organized by quadrant. 
5.2.2 Automation 
The technical definitions of automation allow for multiple forms, depending on 
the degree of intelligence and autonomy exhibited.  Systems that are completely 
automatic and that can be trusted to work properly without any need for human 
oversight or attention have proven to be effective and valuable. Systems that require 
human oversight or control, which in actuality is almost any complex system, fall under 
the category of human-automation interaction and require considerable care in their 
design and implementation.12 
Automatic systems, especially in medicine, do not operate in a vacuum.13 They 
are part of a complex network, and the outputs and alarms of automatic systems have 
to be integrated with other components and often interpreted and, when necessary, 
overridden by human operators.  The intermix of different complex systems plus 
humans provides widespread opportunity for both good and harm.  
Historically, automated systems have often been developed and deployed quite 
independently of the others with which they must co-exist, leading to confusing and 
sometimes contradictory signaling, monitoring requirements, and safety concerns. The 
result is an ever-growing set of alarms (often indistinguishable from one another) and 
different operating requirements, meaning that new users may not know how to 
proceed, yet the proliferation of new systems makes it impossible for training to keep 
apace. The problem of alert fatigue is well known, as evidenced by the large number of

publications and symposia dedicated to this problem in all industries that are affected: 
aviation, process control, and medicine.14 
The worst problem of automatic systems is an issue of trust. If personnel trust 
them, the trust is often over-generous, so that personnel are apt to believe erroneous 
indicators and operations for longer than is prudent, or they may neglect attending to 
and monitoring of the system even though it is not fully reliable. Similarly, a lack of trust 
may also be inappropriate, leading people to add to their workload to continually check 
on the operation of a system that is, in fact, quite capable of autonomous operation. 
The problems of over- and underautomation have been well documented in 
other domains and industries, but the committee believes that they have not been 
appropriately appreciated within the medical community. Much can be gained in an 
industry by the introduction of more intelligent, more autonomous systems, but the 
lessons from other disciplines must also be acquired and followed.15  Automation has 
been implemented most successfully in aviation and process-control manufacturing. 
Automation is also used in warehousing and traditional manufacturing, as well as in 
many modern electronic-commerce back-end systems. Stock trading is another example 
of an activity in which automation can be used successfully.    
All these cases differ from medicine (although prescription filling and checking 
may come closest to matching order-filling systems), however , and the lessons they 
provide cannot be carried over directly into medicine.  But drawing on such hard-earned 
experience as a point of departure for medicine makes good sense. 
Finally, the introduction of automation is always a systems problem that 
intermixes equipment, administrative procedures, and real people.  Accordingly, 
research on automation for medicine will require a multidisciplinary team approach,

organized by quadrant. 
5.2.3 Data Sharing and Collaboration 
The data relevant to health care are highly heterogeneous, and the types and 
quantity of data evolve rapidly.  In addition to patient-record information that exists in 
multiple forms, health care requires data about drugs and diagnoses, including data  
from signals captured by biomedical devices, voice recordings, and data captured as 
codes. Data are typically stored in multiple locations on multiple systems.  Sometimes 
such data are stored in structured databases, and in other cases relevant data are found 
in legacy systems, structured files, and databases and text files behind Web forms. Data 
are increasingly multimedia and high-dimensional, including voice, imaging, and 
continuous biomedical signals.  Data of various types have different degrees of 
reliability, ranging from test results (which may be quite conclusive) to patient-provided 
data (which could contain significant biases).  Numerous health care IT challenges 
require the ability to share and integrate data across multiple systems and seamlessly 
move data from one system to another . 
To exploit highly heterogeneous data effectively, users—such as caregivers, 
medical researchers, and patients—need the ability to ask queries that span multiple 
data sources without requiring the data to be standardized or requiring the user to 
query each single database in isolation. That is, the user wants a single interface 
through which any query can be posed.  
Today, the challenge for data integration, by which is meant systems that enable 
data owners to share data and collaborate in flexible ways without having to store all 
the data in a single repository or have them all conform to a common schema, is 
understood from the systems and logical perspectives.  One approach is to aggregate 
patient health care information into a common data repository [C4O14].  Although 
aggregation is a basic building block of data integration, aggregating all relevant data 
into a single repository is likely to be infeasible.  As a result of a significant amount of 
research, there are commercial systems today that are capable of answering queries 
that span multiple sources without loading all the data into a single warehouse with a 
uniform schema.  The user of such a system accesses the data through an abstraction 
called a mediated schema, and queries are then reformulated from the mediated 
schema onto the relevant data sources using a set of semantic mappings. These 
systems perform adequately, and the small additional cost of accessing remote systems 
at query time is offset by the management benefits of having systems that can share 
locally owned and maintained components.  
The main shortcoming of current data integration systems is that they are too 
hard to use. Designing a mediated schema and creating the semantic mappings 
between the sources and the mediated schema entail a significant effort that requires

considerable subject-matter expertise. This is especially true when the schema is large, 
complicated, and likely to be continually evolving, as in the case of health care data. As 
a consequence, integration projects often fail mid-way since the costs of this design 
work are incurred up-front before the benefits from that work are obtained. 
The above challenge suggests three specific research directions: 
•	 Data integration systems that are fundamentally easier to use. The system 
should be able to examine the data sources available and suggest to the 
designers a possible mediated schema and mappings from the data sources to 
semantically related entries in the mediated schema. The system should point to 
gaps in the coverage of the data sources so that additional sources can be 
discovered or enhanced. The system should present to the designer effective 
visualizations of the data and the schemata to further facilitate the process.  
Gaps in the system's coverage can be detected by analyzing queries (e.g., 
frequent queries asking for an attribute of a patient which is not represented in 
any of the data sources of which the system is aware). 
•	 Data integration that can proceed incrementally. It should not be necessary to 
completely integrate data sources in order to get some benefit from the 
collection of sources. One approach to reducing the effort required in data 
integration is what might be called “pay-as-you-go” data integration.  A design 
goal should be the construction of systems that offer access to multiple data 
sources with little or no human effort, and that improve over time as the users 
realize where integration is needed most. For example, a system could begin by 
guessing approximate (and possibly incorrect) semantic mappings; over time, 
semantic mappings would be improved, thereby enabling more comprehensive 
answers to queries over the collection of data sources. Some of the specific 
challenges to obtaining such systems are (1) leveraging user interactions with 
the system to understand the semantics of the data, (2) developing collaborative 
techniques for improving the semantic cohesion of a collection of data sources, 
and (3) maintaining compatibility of incremental integration efforts with previous 
versions. 
•	 More flexible architectures for data sharing and integration. Currently, the 
common architecture for such systems envisages a single mediated schema and 
mappings to that schema.16 While this architecture has the advantage that the 
data can still remain in the sources and be managed there, the creation of the 
mediated schema is still a centralized effort.  Systems are needed that enable 
data owners to share data in a more ad hoc fashion and extend the coverage of 
data sharing as they see fit.17 Peer-to-peer architectures are needed for sharing 
16 See, for example, a common architecture for enterprise information integration 
products from IBM (http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/integration/) and BEA (now 
Oracle) (http://edocs.bea.com/liquiddata/docs81/index.html). 
17 This embodies the philosophy underlying the Semantic Web approach.

data whereby it is easy to (1) discover data sources, (2) join the network of 
available sources without significant effort, and (3) retain control over the data 
and its privacy as necessary.18  In addition, such a system should enable tracking 
different versions of the data as the data evolve over time, and highlight the 
changes when appropriate. 
If these challenges can be met, it will be much easier to build and deploy data 
integration systems that require minimal set-up time and provide valuable services 
without specifying complete and accurate semantic mappings.  For example, certain 
data regarded as critical might be made interoperable through explicitly designed 
semantic mappings.  But all data might be made available (i.e., visible) subject to 
control for confidentiality even if no mappings had been created.  A care provider 
needing data for which no mappings were available would have to work harder to query 
those data, but those data would at least be visible and usable for clinical purposes.  If 
and when a need is recognized for making a particular class of data semantically 
consistent, mappings could be created—and the system’s overall interoperability could 
be incrementally improved. 
Box 5.5 describes some of the technical research challenges for data sharing and 
collaboration organized by quadrant. 
To illustrate the importance of data integration, consider its application to the 
personal health record.  In its ideal future form (not that of today), a personal health 
record contains an individual’s entire medical history, that is, from all interactions with 
all health care providers (and self-provided care as well) and is under the control of the 
patient.19 For information to be easily accessible to the patient, data supplied by 
different providers—likely each with their own local health care IT systems generating 
data in idiosyncratic formats and with different meanings—must be integrated in a way 
that they appear to have common semantics.  Data protection—a key element of 
personal health records, in that the patient is empowered to apply fine-grained control 
of the information contained therein—also requires that patient-specified security and 
privacy policies act on all data elements referring to the targets of those policies.  This 
requirement presents yet another data integration task.

Presuming the existence of large integrated corpora of data (the focus of Section 
5.2.3 on data integration), another major challenge is in managing those data.  Some of 
the important dimensions of medical information management include: 
•	 Annotation and metadata. Raw data almost never speak for themselves, and 
their interpretation inevitably relies on metadata—annotations to the primary 
data that provide the necessary context.  For example, the primary data for 
the human genome consist of a sequence of some 3 billion nucleotides.  
Metadata associated with the primary data help scientists to identify 
significant patterns within those data—a given sequence might be annotated 
as a gene or a regulatory element. Metadata could also be used to trace the 
provenance or lineage of data. For example, the value of certain data in an 
electronic health record could be enhanced if the data included information 
about the conditions under which certain data were obtained (e.g., physician 
observations of a patient’s description of symptoms might be accompanied by 
video and audio recordings of the session with the patient).  With metadata, a 
primary problem is the design and development of tools to facilitate machine-
readable annotations in large databases. 
•	 Information extraction from text. The volume of medically significant 
information rendered in text form (e.g., physician or nursing notes) is large, 
and may in various instances be as or more significant than information 
rendered in different forms (e.g., lab instrument readings).  Extracting useful 
medical information from textual notes is therefore an important problem that 
calls for computer science expertise in text processing, natural language 
processing, and statistical text-mining techniques as well as medical expertise 
to understand the concepts and ideas to which the information refers.  New 
techniques are needed for extracting information such as patient names, 
doctor names, medicine names, and disease names from textual notes, and 
for generating automatic linkages between different relevant entities.  Such 
extraction would make it possible to piece together a larger picture 
automatically while pulling information from multiple heterogeneous data and 
information sources. Extraction of data from tables and figures in reports is 
another example of a useful information extraction capability. 
•	 Linkage. Clinicians often rely on multiple types of data to render a 
diagnosis—e.g., blood tests and clinical observations and imaging.  
Relationships between different types of data are best captured in 
ontologies,21 which are descriptions of concepts and relationships that exist 
21 The term “ontology” is a philosophical term referring to the subject of 
existence. The computer science community borrowed the term to refer to 
“specification of a conceptualization” for knowledge sharing in artificial intelligence.  
(See, for example, T .R. Gruber , “A Translation Approach to Portable Ontology 
Specification,” Knowledge Acquisition 5(2):199-220, 1993.)

among the concepts for a particular domain of knowledge.  In addition to 
providing controlled, hierarchically structured vocabularies for medical 
terminology, they specify object classes, characteristics, and functions in ways 
that capture important concepts and relationships between those concepts 
(perhaps in a given area, such as internal medicine or cardiology or 
oncology).  Ontologies containing such information facilitate the 
representation of working hypotheses and the evidence that supports and 
refutes them in machine-readable form, and can help clinicians reason their 
way through complex cases.  Ontologies must also be revisable in the light of 
new research that may discover previously unknown relationships or develop 
new interpretations of existing concepts.  An important research problem is 
thus the design of appropriate ontologies and automated approaches to 
populating and updating them through sources such as medical dictionaries, 
textbooks, and recent articles in the relevant literature, although it is an open 
question to what extent declarative approaches can capture and exploit all the 
relevant relationships. Fallback to programmed solutions provides an escape 
and should be possible to allow putting into practice implementations that can 
provide feedback and thus enable progress. 
•	 Privacy. Epidemiological research and phase IV drug testing (post-approval) 
both depend on the aggregation of select medical data from large numbers of 
individual records, even if individual identities need not be associated with 
these data. The electronic storage of these records facilitates such 
aggregation, but aggregation on a large scale also has many privacy 
implications.  An important research problem is thus how to mine these data 
without unduly compromising individual privacy when individuals have not 
explicitly granted data access permission.  Additionally, even outside the world 
of epidemiological research, the management of data in ways that permit data 
sharing among those with a need to know, while prohibiting other access, is a 
significant technical challenge. 
•	 Scale and other systems issues. There are many challenges in creating and 
implementing the protocols and systems that will allow a variety of 
interlocking systems to provide a robust, high-performance information store 
that can be reliably and easily accessed by a variety of different classes of 
users, ranging from the patient and her designees to caregivers.  For 
example, interlocking health care IT systems must enable and preserve the 
relationships among the different applications and workflows.  In addition, the 
need to store data for a lifetime presents significant technical challenges if 
only because the storage lifetime could exceed the lifetime of some 
organizations. 
•	 User interface. While technically not data management per se, the data 
models, data federation technologies, and security and privacy approaches 
must all support the wide variety of usage that is expected.  What an

emergency room physician needs is very different from what is required by a 
physician reviewing the data with an eye toward wellness, a point understood 
by at least some in the biomedical informatics community since the 1980s.22 
Visualization tools that help users integrate and manage data pulled from 
multiple sources might also be considered part of a sophisticated user 
interface, and coupled with analytic techniques may help to solve problems 
that are not possible to solve using analytic techniques alone. 
There are many more dimensions to the problem than those described above, 
which are intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.  In addition, Box 5.6 
describes some of the technical research challenges for data management at scale 
organized by quadrant. 
In summary, the problems addressed in Section 5.2.3 and in this section are core 
problems that would lead to the creation of health care records with enormously diverse 
applications.  These applications include providing the information that would, among 
others things, (1) power the virtual patient described in Section 5.1, (2) provide a strong 
foundation for epidemiological research, (3) improve communication throughout the 
caregiver ecosystem, and (4) offer information storage and retrieval that would enable 
patients and their family and friends to be more involved in their own health care. 
5.2.5 Automated Full Capture of Physician-Patient Interactions 
As noted above, care providers spend a great deal of time in documenting their 
interactions with patients.  Automated capture of patient-provider interactions would 
release such time for more productive uses and help to ensure more complete and more 
timely patient records. 
A comprehensive environment for capturing interactions would necessarily be 
multimodal, involving ways of capturing and interpreting visual images and 
conversations.  Rather than one general-purpose environment, capture environments 
would likely be specialized to different settings—such as hospital room (e.g., 
nurse/patient), emergency room (e.g., ER physician/patient), routine consultation 
(primary care provider/patient), and specialist consultation (e.g., cardiologist or surgeon 
and patient). 
Some of the important dimensions in this problem domain include: 
•	 Real-time transcription and interpretation of the dialog between patient and 
provider. Individual voices must be identified as being associated with the 
22 See, for example, Eric Sherman and Edward Shortliffe, “A User-Adaptable Interface to 
Predict Users' Needs,” pp. 285-315 in M. Schneider-Hufschmidt, T . Kuhme, and U. 
Mallinowski (Eds.), Adaptive User Interfaces. Elsevier , Amsterdam, 1993.  User 
customization of an interface is an example of an idea that was difficult to implement 
with the technology of 20 years ago but now is much more feasible with today’s 
technology and just as important today to pursue.

provider or the patient. The transcript must be parsed unambiguously, irrelevant 
information identified and ignored, and relevant information interpreted.   
•	 Summarization of physical interactions between patient and provider based on 
the interpretation of images recorded by various cameras in the care providing 
room. In a hospital room, the system must be able to distinguish between the 
administration of an intravenous antibiotic or a tubal feeding.  In an examination 
room, the system must be able to identify parts of the body to which the patient 
or provider is pointing and correlate such gestures with the dialog.  In all 
settings, cameras should be able to identify documents presented to patients, 
and to capture written annotations made by patient or provider , subject to 
appropriate privacy safeguards.  The goal would be a system able to produce a 
useful summary and/or the equivalent of a video transcript that describes what 
happened. 
•	 Transcript visibility for patients, and patients’ ability to correct and annotate the 
transcript. 
•	 Correlation of the information contained in the audio and visual transcripts. Use 
of both types of information should increase the accuracy and utility of the 
resulting summaries. 
Some pieces of this technology exist, but even when they do, integrating them 
and making the results available smoothly, with little latency, are challenges to today’s 
computer science. 
Box 5.7 describes some of the technical research challenges for automated full 
capture of physician-patient interactions organized by quadrant. 
Lastly, a key non-technical issue to be faced by any full-capture system is patient 
acceptance.  In some of today’s interactions between clinician and patient, a patient 
may rely on a clinician’s discretion to refrain from entering into the record certain 
sensitive information related by the patient.  In the absence of believable assurances in 
full-capture clinical interactions that such sensitive information will not be recorded, 
patients may well be less forthcoming or complete in their accounting of their medical 
histories and circumstances.  Such problems will have to be addressed before any such 
system will be widely acceptable.

RECOMMENDATIONS 
Many advances in computer science and engineering in the last 10 to 20 years 
speak to the problems in health care information technology (IT) observed by the 
committee.  These advances include ontologies, data fusion techniques, large-scale 
search capabilities, information visualization, and modern computer system architectures 
to support large-scale distributed systems in a heterogeneous operating environment.  
But for various reasons, these advances have not often been reflected in generally 
available clinical information systems. 
Organizations face difficult economic decisions regarding whether to emphasize 
short-term financial gains relative to longer-term advantages wherein cost savings are 
associated with quality improvement.  In addition, the acquisition processes of many 
health care provider organizations are not often compatible with the development and 
deployment of future health care IT systems that provide cognitive support and are 
evolvable into the future.  Poorly understood or defined requirements, poor development 
processes, and failures to adopt iterative or evolutionary approaches or user-centered 
design are often seen. 
In addition, it is fair to say that the integration of health care IT into operational 
work processes has proven both more essential and more difficult than was first 
expected, at least in part because many attempts to deploy health care IT have not 
taken into account the systems engineering issues inherent in viewing health care as a 
complex, adaptive system. In other words, the research problems have become 
significantly more demanding when conceptualizing the whole as a set of components 
working together to provide a working information and knowledge infrastructure for 21st 
century health care.    
Lastly, there are many unsolved problems related to health care IT , including 
supporting appropriate access while respecting the confidentiality of medical records, 
managing the cognitive load on care providers that results from the availability of large 
volumes of information, and managing the information in a medical record over the 
multidecade lifetime of individuals in the context of rapidly changing scientific and 
medical knowledge. 
Three distinct groups have a meaningful role in addressing these areas.  Federal 
and state government and the health care community must speak to acquisition policy.  
The health care community must insist that vendors supply health care IT systems that 
provide meaningful cognitive support.  And the research community, including 
researchers in computer science and health/biomedical informatics, must play a lead 
intellectual role in advancing the current state of the art in health care IT systems.

Federal and state governments play important roles as supporters of research, 
payers for health care, and stimulators for education.  The committee believes that 
government institutions—especially the federal government—should explicitly embrace 
measurable health care quality improvement as the driving rationale for its health care 
IT adoption efforts, and should shun programs that focus on promoting the adoption of 
specific clinical applications.  While this principle should not be taken to discourage 
incentives to invest in infrastructure (networks, workstations, administrative transaction 
processing systems, platforms for data mining, data repositories, and so on) that 
provides a foundation on which other specific clinical applications can be built, a top-
down focus on specific clinical applications is likely to result in a premature “freezing” of 
inefficient workflows and processes and to impede iterative change.  In focusing on the 
goal to be achieved, namely better and/or less expensive health care, clinicians and 
other providers will be eager to use new health care IT-enabled clinical applications if, 
where, and when such applications can be shown to enable them to do their jobs more 
effectively.   
Health care quality improvement efforts scale from practice groups and individual 
practitioners to large health care organizations to the health care system as a whole. 
Traditionally, quality improvement efforts tend to occur at the level of larger practice 
groups and health care organizations, and are slowed by the requirement to develop 
consensus among the universe of relevant clinicians. Indeed, these efforts require such 
volume of collective effort that most organizations cannot sustain more than a few 
quality improvement initiatives at a time. Given the quality chasm facing many health 
care organizations, such a slow rate of change is unacceptable.   
In contrast, iterative local improvement at the small group or even individual 
practitioner level has the major advantage of being faster and cheaper to accomplish 
because of its small scale.  This allows for improvement efforts to be conducted in 
parallel, increasing the chances of finding successful approaches, while unsuccessful 
approaches can be rapidly and inexpensively discarded.  Local successes also tend to 
build support for additional improvement efforts. Government should promote 
exploration of methods and models for small-scale improvement efforts as well as 
efforts to integrate these small-scale improvements on a larger scale.  A balance with 
many small-scale efforts providing the evidence base for a smaller number of large-scale 
efforts seems appropriate.  
IT is a fundamental enabler for both large-scale and small-scale improvement 
efforts.  But for the most part, the health care IT available in today’s market is not well 
suited to support small-scale optimization, which requires applications that are rapidly 
customizable in the field by end users.  Federally inspired or supported initiatives that 
incentivize health care organizations to undertake iterative small-scale optimization, and 
subsequent translation of successes to a larger scale, are likely to help stimulate the 
creation of a new market for these applications—for example, such incentives might 
take the form of payment premiums for demonstrations of major improvement of a 
result (process or clinical) for a unit of the organization. 
A last point is that work at the health care—IT nexus is interdisciplinary.  A lack 
of familiarity with the domain-specific problems in the health care domain has often 
impeded the efforts of well-meaning computer scientists. Formal and elegant computer 
science, as understood by most computer science researchers, is often a poor match

with the complex cultural and organizational environment of health care and 
biomedicine—topics about which a well-trained computer science graduate is generally 
ignorant.  Academic medical centers often fail to take advantage of relevant expertise— 
especially in health/biomedical informatics—that is available to them.  Such 
organizations are often inclined to turn to internal expertise—the in-house health care IT 
professionals—rather than to the relevant health/biomedical informatics and computer 
science faculty on campus.  Progress at this nexus will require contributions of health 
care experts, computer science experts, experts from the health/biomedical informatics 
community, and health care IT experts working together to understand the problems 
related to improving health care and how IT might be applied to address those 
problems. 
This analysis leads to six important recommendations for the federal 
government: 
•	 Incentivize clinical performance gains rather than acquisition of IT per se. This 
is not to say that IT is irrelevant, but the acquisition of health care IT is better 
guided by what is needed to support improvement efforts.1 For example, the 
development and redesign of work processes to provide effective feedback to 
clinicians logically precede implementation of IT to automate workflow, rather 
than simply acquiring health care IT first.   
•	 Encourage initiatives to empower iterative process improvement and small-
scale optimization. Because the market does not today provide the IT required 
for small-scale optimization (the committee saw no such health care IT in its 
site visits), these initiatives should also provide support for clinicians to work 
with CS/IT experts to design prototype applications to support their 
improvement efforts.  In this short report, the committee did not address the 
nature or scale of support needed, and believes that this is an issue best 
addressed in a second phase of this study. 
•	 Encourage development of standards and measures of health care IT 
performance related to cognitive support for health professionals and 
patients,2 adaptability to support iterative process improvement, and effective 
1 The federal government has two primary policy levers for promoting an agenda 
to improve health care quality—public reporting of comparative performance information 
and pay-for-performance payment policies.  Both of these levers depend on the ability to 
aggregate and analyze data over entire patient episodes, and thus the federal 
government should require or incentivize submitting the data rather than specifying the 
particular health care IT to obtain it.  Once the data are submitted, their aggregation 
and analysis can be accomplished through the kinds of health care IT described in 
Section 5.2.3. 
2 Standards are not a new idea in health care IT—indeed, they are a critical 
element of “plug-and-play” architectures that enable the infusion of new technologies 
when they are available (in contrast to monolithic architectures that make it difficult to 
take advantage of new technologies).  However , to the best of the committee’s 
knowledge, standards oriented toward cognitive support essentially do not exist.

use to improve quality. One lever is to shift the focus of certification efforts 
from task-specific transactional capabilities to capabilities that provide better 
cognitive support for health professionals and patients.  An example of a 
standard oriented toward cognitive support would be a requirement to test 
system effectiveness or human comprehension in the context of the data 
received by the system or person, perhaps in a simulation environment or in 
some working deployed situation. 
•	 Encourage interdisciplinary research in three critical areas.3 (a) organizational 
systems-level research into the design of health care systems processes and 
workflow (i.e., research in systems engineering for a health care delivery 
context); (b) computable knowledge structures and models for medicine 
needed to make sense of available medical data regarding the patient; and (c) 
human-computer interaction in a clinical context.    
a.	 Examples of process and workflow research include languages and 
systems to describe and visualize health care workflows; modeling of 
health care workflow at scale while enabling explicit step-by-step 
escalation rules; support for distributed, multiplayer decision making 
among players with sometimes conflicting views of what factors are  
important; rigorous analysis and documentation of the workflow 
demands of routine practice to understand how computer technology 
could be used to facilitate and support the workflow of the 
practitioner; and use of queuing theory to optimize organizational 
performance. 
b.	 Examples of research into computable knowledge structures and 
models include computable guidelines and approaches for comparing, 
assessing, updating, and integrating these guidelines into a library of 
3 It is beyond the scope of this report to describe in detail the infrastructure 
needed to sustain computer science research as it might apply to health care.  However , 
the recommendations from another NRC report on research at the interface between 
computing and biology are instructive in this regard.  That report indicated that
. . . agencies and foundations should support awards that can be used for 
retraining purposes; balance quality and excellence against openness to new ideas 
in the review process; encourage team formation; provide research opportunities 
for investigators at the interface who are not established enough to obtain funding 
on the strength of their track record alone; use funding leverage to promote 
institutional change; use publication venues to promote institutional change; 
support cyberinfrastructure for biological research; recognize quality publicly; 
recognize the costs of providing access to computing and information resources; 
define specific challenge problems that stretch the existing state of the art but are 
nevertheless amenable to progress in a reasonable time frame; work with other 
agencies; and provide the funding necessary to capitalize on the intellectual 
potential of 21st century biology. (p. 383)

guidelines for a given patient; and systems that can infer clinical 
conditions from raw data (e.g., inferring that “patient is feeling more 
pain” from the report of an upward adjustment in the intravenous drip 
of a pain management drug).  Because the clinical interpretation of 
data depends on the current state of knowledge about medicine and 
about physiology and how people respond to treatments and so on, 
computable structures are important because they connect medical 
knowledge to patient data in machine-readable and machine-
executable form.  Thus, they can provide needed abstractions for the 
health care provider and the clinician to help them understand what is 
going on with a given patient. 
c.	 Examples of research into clinically oriented human-computer 
interaction would include the development of systems for maximizing 
the capture, retrieval, and display of clinically relevant information 
and handling related uncertainties in ways that minimally distract 
from attention to the patient and situation yet provide information in 
a manner that is immediately understandable and interpretable.  Such 
uncertainties include those associated with the information itself and 
those associated with other matters as well, such as how a patient 
might respond to treatment or scientific uncertainties about the 
nature of a disease. Specialized systems would provide different 
presentations for the different relevant audiences: caregivers, medical 
staff, insurance companies, patients, and relatives. The research 
challenge is to be able to extract information relevant to the moment 
in a way that can readily be assimilated from the tables, graphs, and 
free-text information about the patient. The collection and recording 
of information should be incorporated into the normal examination 
and caregiving actions so that these actions do not disrupt caregiving 
(as is the case now), yet provide a comprehensive record. 
Information dashboards would allow a rapid overview of multiple 
patients, calling attention to cases that require closer examination.
As before, the committee did not address in this short report the nature or 
scale of support needed and believes that this is an issue best addressed in a 
second phase of this study. 
•	 Encourage (or at least do not impede) efforts by health care organizations and 
communities to aggregate data about health care people, processes, and 
outcomes from all sources subject to appropriate protection of privacy and 
confidentiality. Data aggregation efforts, which should be regarded as 
infrastructural in nature, will entail some expense, and reimbursement 
schedules should not discourage such expenses.  Recognize that the time for 
payoff from these systems may be lengthy, while a critical mass of data is 
being acquired, while data quality is improved, and while systems and 
processes are developed that can utilize the data.   Encourage the decoupling 
of data from applications (e.g., more reimbursement might be allowed for 
organizations that have the capability to export data in standard formats that

accommodate heterogeneous data types). Where possible, reduce or 
eliminate organizational and legal barriers to data sharing while taking due 
note of relevant privacy concerns. 
•	 Support additional education and training efforts at the intersection of health 
care, computer science, and health/biomedical informatics. The purpose of 
such efforts is to produce more individuals with expertise in both domains— 
physicians or nurses with undergraduate or graduate degrees in computer 
science or industrial and systems engineering, computer science researchers 
knowledgeable about medicine (e.g., with a master’s degree in medical 
innovation) who work on health care problems, and so on.  The National 
Institutes of Health career development programs (often known as the K 
program) and institutional training programs for medical informatics are 
models for such support, 4 as are the research training programs in 
health/biomedical informatics supported by the National Library of Medicine at 
many educational institutions in the United States.5 
6.2 THE COMPUTER SCIENCE COMMUNITY 
As early as 1992, the computer science community has been exhorted to seek 
intellectual challenges in problem domains of societal significance.6  Nowhere are such 
challenges more apparent and important than in health care.  Accordingly, the 
committee believes that the computer science community should: 
•	 Engage as co-equal intellectual partners and collaborators with health care 
practitioners and experts in health/biomedical informatics and other relevant 
disciplines, such as industrial and process engineering and design, in an 
ongoing relationship to understand and solve problems of importance to health 
care. Such engagement will require overcoming important differences of 
intellectual style that inevitably separate disciplines.  For example, there may 
be intellectual tensions between simplification and abstraction in the service of 
understanding on the one hand and the capture of details in the service of 
clinical fidelity on the other—and such tensions will have both positive and 
negative consequences. 
•	 Develop institutional mechanisms within academia for rewarding work at the 
health care/computer science interface. As argued in other reports,7

Pre-publication copy – subject to further editorial correction 
institutional difficulties often arise in academia when interdisciplinary work is 
involved.  Collaborators from different disciplines must find and maintain 
common ground, such as agreeing on goals for a joint project, but must also 
respect one another’s separate priorities, such as having to publish in primary 
journals, present at particular conferences, or obtain tenure in their respective 
departments according to departmental criteria. Such cross-pressures and 
expectations from home departments and disciplinary colleagues remain even 
if the participants in a collaboration have similar goals for a project.  (An 
example might be the Harvard-MIT program in health sciences and 
technology.) 
•	 Support educational and retraining efforts for computer science researchers 
who want to explore research opportunities in health care. Such efforts might 
be offered across a broad front and might span a range in several dimensions, 
including time and format (e.g., weeks to years; courses, workshops, degree 
programs, postdoctoral fellowships), content (i.e., different problems within 
health care), and target audience (i.e., undergraduates to fully tenured 
faculty).   
6.3 HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS 
The senior management in health care organizations (including the chief 
executive officer , chief quality officer , chief medical informatics officer , chief information 
officer , and chief financial officer) and health care payers have often taken the lead in 
the deployment of IT for health care, and are thus the primary audience to whom the 
following recommendations are directed.   
•	 Organize incentives, roles, workflow, processes, and supporting infrastructure 
to encourage, support, and respond to opportunities for clinical performance 
gains. Focus on identifying, prioritizing, and managing changes in process and 
workflow, and only after doing so support them by technology.  Use the 
context of the organization’s quality improvement strategy to guide and correct 
IT decisions.  
•	 Balance the institution’s IT portfolio among the four domains of automation, 
connectivity, decision support, and data-mining capabilities. 
•	 Develop the necessary data infrastructure for health care improvement by 
aggregating data regarding people, processes, and outcomes from all sources. 
•	 Insist that vendors supply IT that permits the separation of data from 
applications and facilitates data transfers to and from other non-vendor 
applications in shareable and generally useful formats. 
•	 Seek IT solutions that yield incremental gains from incremental efforts. Efforts 
that make progress in many small steps build support and consensus from the 
grass roots.  One example of such an approach might be an institutional

Washington, D.C., 1998.

commitment to digitize all paper records and make them available 
electronically in image format to all care providers.  Even if capturing paper 
records in such a form would not make all of their content machine readable, it 
would go a long way toward eliminating the widely acknowledged problem of 
record unavailability that plagues a large number of patient-provider visits.  
And the infrastructure needed for such efforts could be used in the future to 
support other applications.

CONCLUDING THOUGHTS 
The nation has made a commitment to achieve the nationwide use of electronic 
medical records by 2014.  Many meaningful and useful steps can be taken today toward 
this goal. However , this goal reflects expectations for improvement in the quality and 
cost-effectiveness of health care that will require more than just wider implementation 
of today’s health care information technology.   
At the start of its work, the committee had set out to identify a variety of long-
term opportunities for greater involvement of the computer science research community 
in addressing health care problems.  And indeed, the committee did identify a number of 
such opportunities, which are described above.  But it was also struck by the number of 
other opportunities for meaningful progress that do not depend on research—that is, 
areas of improvement in which today’s information technologies are reasonably 
adequate for initiating and sustaining meaningful progress and yet are not being fully 
leveraged for health care.  In addition, the committee was surprised to see how little 
attention had been paid—across the board—to support for the cognitive functions that 
clinicians manage, organize, coordinate, and use the vast amounts of information 
needed for effective health care. It is in this domain that the committee believes 
enormous leaps and bounds are possible, and also where a substantial number of grand 
research challenges reside.

B.2 SITE VISIT METHODOLOGY 
For each site visit, the committee sought to: 
•	 Observe the best of what the site had been able to achieve. 
•	 Ask about what the site needed but did not have. 
•	 Obtain site input on the gap between needs and the state of the art of the health care 
information technology industry. 
•	 Identify, clarify, and categorize “pain points” for the site. 
•	 Identify where improvement is possible through application of existing knowledge and 
where further research is needed. 
To preserve face time for interactive questions and answers, each site host was asked 
to provide as much background as possible as pre-visit reading material.  Hosts were requested 
to limit formal presentations to a 10-minute overview of their key messages, leaving the 
majority of each time block for interactive exploration.  Where possible, hosts arranged for 
committee visitors to shadow care providers engaged in workday activities (e.g., on rounds, at 
the central nursing station).  Shadowing teams were generally composed of one health care 
provider and one computer scientist (and one staff person), so that teams could operate in 
parallel. 
Information requested in pre-visit reading material included: 
•	 Organization “facts”  (FTEs, admissions, visits, research dollars, and so on) 
•	 Health care organization's organizational chart 
•	 Health care organization's strategic plan 
•	 IT organization chart 
•	 Information management or IT strategic plan 
•	 Information system inventory 
•	 Information technology architecture or standards specifications 
•	 Last most wired survey responses 
•	 Last joint commission visit report 
During each visit, the committee visitors sought to visit or to hear about as many of the

Appendix C 

Observations, Consequences, and Opportunities: 

The Site Visits of the Committee  

Table C.1, which summarizes the committee’s observations from the site visits, is structured 
as follows. 
•	 Column 1 – Observations (what committee members saw during the site 
visits).  Under each observation are listed one or more de-identified data points.  The 
high-level observation is the abstraction for those data points.  The committee grouped 
the observations into six categories: 
o	 Category 1. The medical record itself—the display, the application, the paper; in 
general, what the user interacts with directly. 
o	 Category 2. The health care delivery process—the workflow, what happens 
when, who does it, how decisions are made, how communication occurs. 
o	 Category 3. Health care professionals—what they are like, how they react to IT , 
and so on. 
o	 Category 4. IT infrastructure and management—the underlying computing 
substrate and how it is managed. 
o	 Category 5. Data capture and flow—how data are gathered, recorded, and 
passed among systems, records, and people. 
o	 Category 6. Change in a sociotechnical system—how to create environments 
that facilitate large scale change. 
•	 Column 2 – Consequences (why the observations matter). For each 
observation, the committee infers one or more consequences.  That is, why do we care 
about the observation in question?  How might it affect health care delivery? 
•	 Column 3 – Opportunities for Action (what we can do about the 
consequences).  Every observation-consequence pair should provide one or more 
opportunities for action.  Solutions known today but not yet implemented are indicated 
by an “S” (for short-term) in Column 3; challenges for research, where solutions are not 
known today, are indicated by an “R” (for research) in Column 3.
