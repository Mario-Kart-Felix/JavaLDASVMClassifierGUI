Because networks are confi gured in 
many ways, network systems and data 
communications analysts are needed to 
design, test, evaluate, and manage systems, 
such as local area networks (LANs), wide area 
networks (WANs), the Internet, intranets, and 
other data communications systems. Systems 
can range from a connection between two 
offi ces in the same building to globally 
distributed networks, voicemail, and e-mail 
systems of a multinational organization. 
People with expertise in network systems 
are in high demand for a variety of positions 
in organizations of all sizes and types. 
These people do work such as creating and 
maintaining the infrastructure in medical 
facilities that enables multiple doctors to view 
the same patient’s X-rays to determine the 
diagnosis and best treatment.
Telecommunications specialists focus on 
the interaction between computer and 
communications equipment. These workers 
design voice and data communication 
systems, supervise the installation of the 
systems, and provide maintenance and other 
services to clients after the systems are 
installed.

Job Outlook
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics [2] predicts 
that four of the fi ve job categories with the 
largest expected percentage growth through 
2012 in the U.S. will be in IT areas. Demand 
for qualifi ed IT workers is expected to double 
in the next fi ve years. 
There is a growing demand for network 
systems and data communication analysts 
to help fi rms maximize their effi ciency with 
available technology. Expansion of electronic 
commerce—doing business on the Internet—
and the continuing need to build and maintain 
databases that store critical information 
on customers, inventory, and projects are 
fueling demand. The introduction of the 
wireless Internet, known as WiFi, creates new 
systems to be analyzed and new data to be 
administered. Also, the increasing importance 
placed on cybersecurity—the protection of 
electronic information—will result in a need for 
workers skilled in information security [2].
Employment of computer systems analysts 
and computer support specialists is driven 
by very rapid growth in computer system 
design and related services. The demand 
for networking to facilitate the sharing of 
information, the expansion of client–server 
environments, and the need for computer 
specialists to use their knowledge and skills 
in a problem-solving capacity will be major 
factors in the rising demand for computer 
systems analysts [2].
Remember those classes taught by video or online 
during high school? There is a good demand 
for talented people who can set-up and manage 
multi-media systems being used by education 
and most major companies around the world.

Employment of computer programmers is 
expected to grow more slowly than in previous 
years. Sophisticated computer software now 
has the capability to write basic code, which 
eliminates the need for many programmers 
to do this routine work. The consolidation and 
centralization of systems and applications, 
developments in packaged software, and 
advances in programming languages and tools 
means that more of the programming functions 
can be transferred from programmers to 
other types of information workers, such as 
computer software engineers [2]. 
Employment of multi-media artists and 
animators is expected to increase as 
consumers continue to demand more 
realistic video games, movie and television 
special effects, and 3D animated movies. An 
increasing demand for Web site development 
and for computer graphics adaptation from the 
growing number of mobile technologies will 
create additional job openings [2].
The North Dakota Career Resource Network 
[3] predicts that computer software 
engineers – applications and network 
systems and data communication analysts 
are among the fastest growing occupations 
in North Dakota, with a growth rate of 38.8 
percent and 37.6 percent, respectively. 
The Minnesota Department of Employment 
and Economic Development [4] estimates 
the biggest growth until 2012 for network 
systems and data communication 
analysts (37.3 percent), computer software 
engineers - applications  (33 percent), and 
computer systems analysts (32.7 percent) in 
northwestern Minnesota.

Working Conditions
Computer specialists and programmers, 
network analysts, and database administrators 
normally work in offi ces or laboratories in 
comfortable surroundings. They usually 
work about 40 hours a week—the same as 
many other professional or offi ce workers do. 
However, evening or weekend work may be 
necessary to meet deadlines or solve specifi c 
problems. With the technology available 
today, telecommuting is common for computer 
professionals. As networks expand, more work 
can be done from remote locations through 
modems, laptops, electronic mail, and the 
Internet [10].
Computer support specialists and systems 
administrators constantly interact with 
customers and fellow employees as they 
answer questions and give valuable advice. 
Those who work as consultants are away 
from their offi ces much of the time, sometimes 
spending months working in a client’s offi ce.
14
Employers look for a combination of:
Technical Skills 
 A highly specialized technical skill 
set related to specifi c programming 
languages; database, networking, 
and operating systems, and other 
technologies. These technical skills 
can be combined in many ways.
Experience
Hands-on, real-world experience in 
the application of the technical skill 
set; sometimes, experience related 
to the application of IT in a particular 
industry setting.
What are employers
looking for?
If you are looking to the future perhaps you are wondering how do I prepare 
for the world of work. The following are key skills that employers of the 21st 
century – “your future boss” – are looking for in all fi elds of employment.
Soft and Business Skills
 A range of soft skills and business 
skills, such as oral and written 
communication skills, ability to work 
in teams, and project management 
skills.

A competency profi le for IT occupational areas identifi ed the following 
basic, essential IT skills:
16
Experience
Interviewed IT workers cited that lack of 
experience in a specifi c skill or skills as one of 
the largest barriers they face in getting an IT 
job.
Employers may be willing to accept academic 
degrees, demonstrated soft skills, or IT 
certifi cations that closely match their needs 
instead of job experience in hiring for a trainee 
or entry-level position. 
There are already many ways to collect IT 
experience for High School students:
• part-time computer jobs at the High School
 (creating and maintaining the school’s
 website as a Network Administrator
 Assistant, helping the teacher in charge
 for the computers, or participating in the
 implementation of  an online homework
 grade program for the students)
• designing the graphic part of the High
 School Annual
• shooting a video of the last High School
 Football event etc.
College students can gather experience 
with internships, summer jobs, or campus 
employment [5].
Experience is a very high priority in employer hiring considerations. 
So how do I get where I want to go? Set 
a goal, fi nd a good college program and 
start building your skills through your 
jobs, volunteer work or internships.
If you think computers are for offi ce workers, think again. Most of today’s workforce out in the fi eld carries 
a laptop computer and needs the same computer skills as their colleagues back in the offi ce. Above: A fi eld 
technician from Fargo based Butler Machinery Company uses a computer in the fi eld when managing the big 
machines out engineering the landscape. Photo by Butler Machinery, Inc.
17
Key Soft Skills
As IT has become omnipresent throughout 
organizations and central to mission-critical 
operations, employers have placed an 
increasing emphasis on IT workers’ business 
skills and soft skills, such as the ability to 
communicate effectively and to work in a 
collaborative environment [5].
• Communication Skills
• Interpersonal/Team Skills
• Systems Thinking
• Creative, Critical, and Analytical Thinking
 Skills/Problem Solving
• Ability to Learn Quickly/Adaptability
• Change Agent/Initiative/Leadership
Business Skills
• Needs Analysis
• Project Management
• Client/Customer Relations
• Understanding company fi nancial
 information
• Cost-Benefi t Analysis

18
Formal Education
A postsecondary education is necessary for 
professional-level IT jobs [5]. 
• a four-year degree (Bachelor’s degree),
 especially a technical degree (computer
 science or computer engineering) is
 preferred in: 
 • research
 • developing new software, IT products
 • enterprise-level applications
The majority of college degree workers in IT 
have degrees in science, math, or engineering 
disciplines.
• a two-year degree (Associate’s degree) is
 needed for:
 • tech support/call center jobs
 • web development and administration
 • database-related jobs
 • network design and administration
 • PC maintenance and repair technicians
  often geared more toward meeting the
  needs of local businesses, more
  occupation specifi c than 4-year degree
  programs
• a certifi cations (often 1 year degree) from
 IT vendors Microsoft, Cisco, Novell, and
 Oracle is needed for lower level IT positions,
 demonstrates a level of competence in a
 particular fi eld
Of the 12 professional-level IT occupations, for 
which the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau 
of Labor Statistics collects information, it is 
indicated that 10 of these occupations typically 
require at least a bachelor’s degree [5].

Educational Landscape
IT Bachelor’s Degree Programs
Bachelor’s degree programs in IT generally 
provide a broad, high-level conceptual 
understanding of IT in systems architecture, 
computer programming, and computer 
network systems. 
On the other hand, traditional four-year 
technical degree programs offer less in terms 
of hands-on practical experience and do not 
typically provide business-related skills or 
link the learning to solving specifi c business 
problems. In addition, some programs at 
universities may be out-of-date because they 
are unable to match the speed of change in IT.
IT Minor
At many universities across the Nation, 
undergraduates from a wide range of 
academic majors seeking IT knowledge and 
skills can obtain an IT-related minor—generally 
referred to as a minor in computer science, 
information technology, or management 
information systems. IT minors can offer 
important complementary knowledge to those 
majoring in a natural science, engineering, 
business, or other discipline.
Remember the web design class from high 
school?  If you like working with the web, there 
is a career waiting for you after high school.

Combined IT Bachelor’s/Master’s 
Degree (BS/MS) Programs
Some universities offer a combined BS/
MS program in computer science, computer 
engineering, or both, to encourage their 
students to seek higher level degrees by 
enabling them to earn them faster. These 
programs can reduce the time it takes to earn 
both degrees separately by as much as two 
semesters.

 IT-Related Master of Science (MS) 
Programs
MS programs address a range of IT 
professionals’ needs. Some programs offer 
preparation for advancement to higher 
level jobs, such as those in IT organization 
management and IT business management, 
or for more technically complex jobs, such 
as advanced IT development work. Other 
IT-related MS programs are geared toward 
expanding IT professionals’ portfolios 
of skills into new IT disciplines, such as 
telecommunications, or toward preparing them 
for work in a highly specialized IT application 
area, such as bioinformatics.
20
Techno-MBAs
A new class of MBA programs has arisen 
in recent years, focused on the integration 
of management and technical knowledge. 
In contrast to an MBA with a technical 
concentration, these programs—often referred 
to as “Techno-MBAs”—focus on understanding 
the business value of technology, technology’s 
contribution to the bottom line, and technology 
as a means rather than an end. Generally, 
these degrees are designed for people with 
technical backgrounds who want to advance 
into management positions.
Two-Year Degrees at 
Community Colleges
Community colleges offer a range of IT 
education and training opportunities. These 
programs are popular, in part, because they 
are convenient, economical, and offer training 
opportunities for both full-time students and 
working adults who are seeking to upgrade 
their skills or prepare for a career change 
by attending training on a part-time basis. 
Community colleges primarily provide 
preparation for low- and intermediate-level 
IT jobs, and their offerings focus more on 
practical applications of IT than on theoretical 
studies. Some programs are responding to 
employer demands for soft skills by adding 
group projects and writing requirements to the 
IT curriculum.
Transfer track programs, focused on 
computer science or computer information 
systems management, prepare students 
for transfer to an IT program at a four-year 
college or university; these students are 
working toward a bachelor’s degree in 
computer science, computer engineering, 
or management information systems. 
Terminal track programs are designed 
for students who intend to move directly 
into the workforce after earning their two-
year degree. These programs—which 
often focus on programming, network and 
database administration, and technical 
support—have a higher concentration of 
courses in the technical discipline. The 
curriculum typically places less emphasis 
on concepts and theory than do transfer 
track programs, and greater emphasis on 
practical knowledge.
Wow - the college life!  College offers a whole new 
world of freedom not experienced in high school, 
but be prepared to take on a whole new level of 
studying and being organized for learning!

IT Certifi cate Programs at colleges
IT certifi cate programs offer a wide range 
of opportunities for potential and current IT 
workers to acquire, upgrade, and expand their 
IT skills. These programs — designed for 
introductory, intermediate, and advanced skill 
levels — are offered at community colleges 
and universities at both the undergraduate and 
graduate levels.
The adult continuing education programs 
typically specialize in providing in-depth 
teaching in some particular IT specialty, such 
as networking, e-commerce, or IT security; 
in a specifi c technical skill, such as Java or 
C++ programming; or in a particular vendor’s 
technology, such as Oracle databases. While 
IT certifi cate programs focus mainly on the 
provision of technical skills, some programs 
address knowledge and development 
in business skills and soft skills. These 
concentrated programs of study can add 
depth to an IT worker’s knowledge and skill 
in a particular specialized IT discipline or help 
the worker expand his or her skills into new 
discipline areas. While certifi cate programs 
can vary signifi cantly in length and cost, they 
are often less costly, faster, and more focused 
with more links to jobs and careers than 
advanced degree programs.
Variability in program content, length, and 
cost — even when certifi cates have the 
same name — means that IT workers and 
employers face challenges in understanding 
and considering their IT
certifi cate training options. Both IT 
workers and employers face a confusing 
maze of offerings and a credential—the 
certifi cate—that has no standard meaning 
of accomplishment across the academic 
enterprise. 
It takes a ‘team’ to succeed in today’s work setting. Even though 
you may train for one area of expertise, being a team player will 
most likely be required to get a job done. Above: A media team

The fi eld of computer engineering takes good math 
and computer skills and offers a good paycheck for 
both men and women. If you are math savvy, this 
may be a fi eld to explore. Left and below: Computer

Private, For-Profi t IT Education 
and Training Institutions
Private, for-profi t institutions offer a wide 
scope and varying levels of IT education 
and training to prospective and current IT 
workers. IT workers commented that programs 
at private IT schools often use the latest 
technologies and have industry instructors with 
current experience, but the programs are very 
expensive.
Approximately 300 IT certifi cations are 
sponsored by IT vendors and professional 
and industry associations. These 
certifi cations— awarded for passing 
exams—provide independent verifi cation of 
specifi c skills related to specifi c IT products. 
The certifi cations do not represent a 
multidimensional assessment of knowledge, 
soft and business skills, or experience. 
These credentials may help entry-level or 
inexperienced IT job seekers convince an 
employer to give them a try. They also can 
expand a current IT worker’s portfolio of 
credentials and may help an experienced 
IT worker move into a new IT discipline. 
Preparing for certifi cation can represent a 
large investment of time and money. 
Cisco Networking Academy Program
High School students interested in IT can take 
part in a high-school learning program called 
the Networking Academy, offered by Cisco. 
The company works with high schools across 
the United States to establish programs that 
let students from age 12 on get an early start 
on their IT education. Many high schools and 
educational community institutions in the Red 
River Basin participate in this program.
Here is the web address to locate the nearest 
academy: http://locators.netacad.net/cnams/

Recommended High 
School Courses
According to the Department of Education 
typical admissions requirements for four-year 
colleges include:
• 4 years of English (grammar and
 composition, American literature, English
 literature, world literature)
• 3–4 years of mathematics (algebra I and II,
 geometry, trigonometry, precalculus,
 calculus)
• 2–3 years of history and geography
• 3–4 years of laboratory science (biology,
 chemistry, physics)
• 2–3 years of foreign language
• 1 year of the visual and performing arts
• 1–3 years of appropriate electives
 (computer science) 
Higher levels of preparation in mathematics 
and laboratory sciences may aid in admission 
to some colleges’ IT bachelor’s programs [7].
Believe it or not, High School is the place to start planning for your 
future. Want to get ahead of the crowd? Then read below how to plan 
for your future while still in high school.
