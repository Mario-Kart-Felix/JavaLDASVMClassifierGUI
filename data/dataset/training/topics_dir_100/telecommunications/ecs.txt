software architecture and design, program testing, validation, and quality assurance. The Electrical Engineering program 
offers students an opportunity to acquire a solid foundation in the broad areas of electrical engineering and emphasizes 
advanced study in digital systems, telecommunications, and microelectronics.  The Telecommunications Engineering program 
is interdisciplinary. Telecommunications Engineering requires a blend of knowledge from the areas of Electrical Engineering, 
Computer Science, and Economics/Policy. The Electrical Engineering, Telecommunications Engineering, Software Engineering 
and Computer Science programs are based on a solid foundation of science and mathematics coursework. Students in these 
programs are given an opportunity to learn to extend their abilities to analyze and solve complex problems and to design 
new uses of technology to serve today's society.  The Engineering programs provide an integrated educational experience 
directed toward the development of the ability to apply pertinent knowledge to the identification and solution of practical 
problems in electrical and telecommunications engineering. These programs ensure that the design experience is developed 
and integrated throughout the curriculum in a sequential development leading to advanced work and includes both 
analytical and experimental studies. Established cooperative education programs with area industry further supplement 
design experiences. 
 
The University of Texas at Dallas is located at the heart of a high concentration of companies that specialize in the areas of 
microelectronics, telecommunications, signal processing and optics. The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer 
Science maintains close relationships with these companies and has established cooperative programs through which 
students can obtain industrial experience to complement their classroom instruction. Details of specific cooperative programs 
between Computer Science and Engineering students and local companies are available in the respective program offices.  
 
Industrial Practice Programs 
The Industrial Practice Programs (IP Programs or IPP) of the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science 
include the school’s Cooperative Education, Internship, and Curricular Practical Training Programs. These programs combine 
classroom learning with paid work experience. Qualified students are referred to participating employers seeking candidates 
for career-related, pre-professional work assignments. The programs enhance a student’s education and career preparation 
by integrating classroom theory with on-the-job performance, providing an understanding of work environments and 
professional requirements, testing career and professional goals, developing confidence, maturity and skills in human 
relations, and establishing contacts and interests. 
 
Students are expected to register with and follow the rules of the IP Programs when working in any position titled by the 
employer as an Internship or a Cooperative Education assignment.  Also, the Jonsson School offers one credit hour ECSC 
courses that may fill UTD free elective requirements and provide students the opportunity to evaluate their work experience.

The Electrical Engineering Department offers two engineering programs: Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications 
Engineering.  The Electrical Engineering program offers students an opportunity to acquire a solid foundation in the broad 
areas of electrical engineering and emphasizes advanced study in digital systems, telecommunications, and microelectronics. 
 
The Electrical Engineering program offers students a solid educational foundation in the areas of electrical networks, 
electronics, electromagnetics, computers, digital systems, and communications and is accredited by the Engineering 
Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Mastery of these areas 
provides students with the ability to adapt and maintain leadership roles in their post-baccalaureate pursuits through the 
application of fundamental principles to a rapidly changing and growing discipline. 
 
Students in the Electrical Engineering program take either the general program or specialize in microelectronics or 
telecommunications, and can take advanced courses in computer hardware and software; the analysis and design of analog 
and digital communication systems; analog and digital signal processing; the analysis, design, and fabrication of 
microelectronic components and systems; and guided and unguided wave propagation. A broad choice of electives (within 
and external to electrical engineering) allows students to broaden their education as well as develop expertise in areas of 
particular interest. In keeping with the role of a professional, students are expected to develop communication skills and an 
awareness of the relationship between technology and society. 
 
The Telecommunications Engineering program is interdisciplinary. Telecommunications Engineering requires a blend of 
knowledge from the areas of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Economics/Policy.   
 
The Electrical and Telecommunications Engineering programs are based on a solid foundation of science and mathematics 
coursework.  Students in these programs are given an opportunity to learn to extend their abilities to analyze and solve 
complex problems and to design new uses of technology to serve today's society.  The engineering programs provide an 
integrated educational experience directed toward the development of the ability to apply pertinent knowledge to the 
identification and solution of practical problems in electrical and telecommunications engineering.  These programs ensure 
that the design experience, which includes both analytical and experimental studies, is integrated throughout the curriculum 
in a sequential development leading to advanced work.  Design problems are frequently assigned in both lecture and 
laboratory courses.  Each student is required to complete a major design project during the senior year.  In addition, 
established cooperative education programs with area industry further supplement design experiences. 
 
Mission of the Electrical Engineering Program 
The focus of the Electrical Engineering degree is to provide excellent education in modern electrical engineering practice. Our 
graduates are uniquely qualified for rewarding and successful careers in materials, devices, circuits, digital systems, signal 
processing, and communications. In the spring of 2005 the EE faculty adopted a new set of Program Educational objectives 
which refined the prior objectives and established measurements and benchmarks to monitor progress. The ECS Office of 
Assessment developed a new Alumni Survey instrument to measure progress toward these objectives and conducted a 
preliminary survey to collect data. The results of this survey should be available in the fall of 2005. The Electrical Engineering 
faculty will set the thresholds for performance based on this survey in the fall of 2005. 
 
Specific Program Educational Objectives 
One broad goal for the Erik Jonsson School is an excellent education for our students. Our earlier Program Educational 
Objectives (PEOs) toward this goal are: 
 
• Preparation for a successful, long-lived, engineering career 
• Perform, review and assess sophisticated engineering design and manufacturing 
• Further the necessities of innovation, functionality, safety, and economy in engineering 
• Critical thinking, decision making and communicating 
• Ability to contribute and to lead engineering teams 
• Place engineering design and decision making in a market and societal context. 
 
Additional Program Educational Objectives for a high quality educational infrastructure include: 
 
• Growing and maintaining an outstanding faculty that remains motivated and empowers 
• Excellent facilities, including teaching laboratories, computing facilities and classrooms with advanced 
presentation capabilities. 
 
Our most recent set of Program Educational Objectives and the measurement associated with each is listed below: 
 
• A successful long-lived engineering career. Measurement: The percentage of our graduates still working as 
engineers five (5) years after graduation. 
• Meeting the needs of local industry. Measurement: The percentage of our graduates receiving job offers 
from the top twenty (20) local engineering firms. 
• Leading engineering teams. Measurement: The percentage of our graduates lead engineering design team 
supervising two or more engineers in a designing effort within five (5) years after graduation. 
• Actively use engineering skills to mentor and promote the engineering profession in populations 
still underrepresented in it. Measurement: The percentage of our graduates involved in such activities within 
five (5) years after graduation. 
• Actively pursuing life-long learning. Measurement: The percentage of our graduates either attending 
graduate school or taking additional college level course work to enhance their skills five (5) years after 
graduation. 
 
High School Preparation 
Engineering education requires a strong high school preparation. Pre-engineering students should have high school 
preparation of at least one-half year in trigonometry and at least one year each in elementary algebra, intermediate and 
advanced algebra, plane geometry, chemistry, and physics, thus developing their competencies to the highest possible levels 
and preparing to move immediately into demanding college courses in calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry for 
science majors. It is also essential that pre-engineering students have the competence to read rapidly and with 
comprehension, and to write clearly and correctly. 
 
Lower-Division Study 
All lower-division students in either Electrical Engineering or Telecommunications Engineering concentrate on mathematics, 
science and introductory engineering courses, building competence in these cornerstone areas for future application in 
upper-division engineering courses. The following requirements apply both to students seeking to transfer to U.T. Dallas from 
other institutions as well as to those currently enrolled at U.T. Dallas, whether in another school or in the Erik Jonsson School 
of Engineering and Computer Science.  
 
ABET Requirements 
All engineering degree plans must satisfy the requirements specified by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and 
Technology (ABET). The course work must include at least: 
1) One year (32 SCH) of an appropriate combination of mathematics and basic sciences, 
2) One-half year (16 SCH) of humanities and social sciences,  
3) One and one-half years (48 SCH) of engineering topics. 
Although the electrical engineering and telecommunications engineering curricula that follow have been designed to meet 
these criteria, students have the responsibility, in consultation with an advisor, to monitor their own choice of courses 
carefully to be certain that all academic requirements for graduation are being satisfied. Students are strongly encouraged to 
take courses in such subjects as accounting, industrial management, finance, personnel administration, and engineering 
economy.
