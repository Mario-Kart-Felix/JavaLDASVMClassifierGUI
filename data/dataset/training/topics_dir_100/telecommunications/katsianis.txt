Introduction
In this thesis we illustrate a complete methodology approach for the technoeconomic 
analysis of telecommunication networks that hereafter is implemented in specific 
detailed telecommunication case studies, wireless or wireline technologies. In the first 
part of this Thesis, following this methodology approach, a new tool for 
technoeconomic analysis has been developed.  This tool is analytically presented as 
well as the methods that have been followed. Within this tool analysis, the theoretical 
approach for the cost evolution of the telecommunication components, the 
methodology for the demand forecast for telecommunication services and products, 
the approach for calculating the operation, administration and maintenance cost of the 
telecommunication network as well as the integration of the risk analysis model that 
quantified the influence of the critical parameter of the problem have been 
analytically presented. In the second part of this thesis the methodology has been 
applied in case studies for 3G networks as well as fixed wireless and wireline access 
(including FTTx solutions). For these case studies the real option theory has been 
applied, in order to clearly define the uncertainty of the investment. In addition, a 
game theory approach for a competition model between an incumbent and a 
newcomer operator has been analyzed. Finally the technoeconomic tool has been 
used, for the definition of a viable approach, for the provision of broadband services

including in this paper).
Techno-economic methodology
The techno-economic evaluation of the case studies has been carried out using the 
methodology introduced and the tool presented hereafter. The TITAN project [1]
developed a model that predicts the cost evolution of the network components and is 
based on a combination of learning curves and logistic models. In addition, for each 
network component, the prediction uncertainties have been specified as a function of 
time. The learning curve model, which presents the cost of a component as a function 
of production volume, can be transferred to a model predicting the costs as a function 
of time, by the introduction of a logistic model. The original methodology and tool 
have been enhanced to be able to cope with complex multimedia service and network 
structures. Furthermore, the methodology has been improved especially in the 
definition of services and assessment of operations, administration and maintenance 
costs. As for the maintenance cost, it is defined separately and is automatically 
included in the model. The operation and administration cost of the Network elements 
are user-defined. The life-cycle cost (LCC) of the network is then produced by adding 
OA&M (Operation Administration & Maintenance) costs and IFCs (Installed First 
Costs). Finally, the overall financial budget is calculated for the various architectures 
by comparing the LCC to the overall revenue. This method has been followed by 
several telecommunication operators in Europe [2][3][4] (e.g. Deutsche Telecom, 
France Telecom, Telenor, Swisscom, Telecom Italia, KPN) affecting their investment 
policy for new services. 
Structure of the Tool for Techno-Economic Evaluations.
Fig. 1 analyses the main principles of the methodology used in this thesis [5]. The 
cost figures for the network components have been collected in an integrated cost 
database, which is the “heart” of the model. This database is frequently updated with 
data obtained from the major telecommunication operators, suppliers, standardization
bodies and other available sources. These data concerns the initial prices for the future 
commercial networks components as well as a projection for the future production 
volume of them. The cost evolution of the different components derives from the cost 
in a given reference year and a set of parameters which characterizes the basic 
principles of the component. For each component in the database, the cost evolution is 
estimated according to the model described in the next paragraph. In addition, 
estimations for the OA&M cost and the production volume of the component are 
incorporated in the database. As a next step in the network evaluation a services 
specification is needed which will be provided to the consumers. The network 
architectures for the selected set of services will be defined, and a geometrical model
or a radio model, will be used in order to calculate the length of the cables (or the 
number of the Radio stations) as well as the civil works for their installation (database 
data). The future market penetration of these services and the tariffs associated with 
them, according to each operator’s policy, will be used for the construction of the 
market evolution model. The operator tariff policy could be taken into account by 
modifying the tariff level in conjunction with the expected penetration of the offered 
services.  Results from statistics or surveys can be easily integrated into the tool when 
formulas measuring the impact of tariff level to the saturation of the services are 
available. 
By entering the data into a financial model we calculate the revenues, investments 
(and IFC) cash flows and profits (or other financial results) of the study network 
architectures for each year of a project’s study period. In the final evaluation of the 
techno-economic model, critical indexes are calculated in order to decide about the 
profitability of the investment.
This tool has been proved that is able to evaluate project of different scale as well as 
completely different and independent telecommunication technologies. The adoption 
of alternative financial (real options approach) and strategic methods (game theory) 
can be included in the tool as will be illustrated in this paper.

Cost Evolution Of The Network Components.
The cost prediction curve is dependent on a set of parameters such as reference cost at 
a given time, the learning curve coefficient that reflects the type of component, 
penetration at the starting time and penetration growth in the component’s market. 
The cost database contains estimation on these parameters for all components and 
generates cost predictions based on the extended learning curve. The forecast function 
for the evolution of the relative accumulated volume  t

where nr(0) is the relative accumulated volume in year 0. The value of nr(0) should be 
equal to 0.5 for components that exist in the market and their price is expected to be 
further reduced due to aging rather than due to the production volume (i.e. very old 
products-many years in the market). From estimations in industrial 
telecommunication network components, nr(0) could be 0.1 for mature products and 
0.01 for new components in the market. P(0) is the price in the reference year 0, T 
is the time for the accumulated volume to grow from 10 % to 90 %, and K is the 
learning curve coefficient. K is the factor that causes reduction in price when the 
production volume is doubled. The K factor can be obtained from the production 
industry, mainly the suppliers. For a component (with constant nr(0)=0.1) that the T 
is equal to 10 years and K is equal to 0.98, Eq. (2) gives almost 2% of reduction in the 
price of the component per year for the first 10 years. If T is 5 years, this reduction 
is almost 4% per year for the first 5 years. All the above described values have been 
extensively used for the evaluation of telecommunications investment projects.
OA&M Approach.
The Operation Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) approach is divided into 
three separate components as follows: 
1. The cost of repair parts
2. The cost of repair work 
3. The Operation and Administration cost for each service cross-related to the number 
of customers or to the number of critical network components.
The formula for calculating OA&M cost is given by:

where Vi is the equipment volume in year i, Pi is the price of cost item in year i, 
Rclass is the maintenance cost percentage for every cost component, Pl is the cost of a 
single working hour, MTTR is the mean time to repair and MTBR is the mean time 
between repairs for the cost item in question. The first term into the parenthesis 
represents the cost of repaired parts, the second term represents the cost of repair 
work, while OA represents the Operation and Administration cost. In order to 
implement the calculation of the OA&M cost, classes for MTTR and MTBR are 
defined in the database of the technoeconomic tool as well as values for Pl and Pi.
Market Analysis
The demand modelling and broadband forecasts are essential inputs to all business 
case analyses. Therefore, demand models and forecasts for different access 
technologies in the fixed and mobile network have been developed in this thesis. In 
addition, models have been developed for forecasting the total broadband penetration 
in Europe. Forecasts have been made based on a four-parameter logistic diffusion 
model [6] which is recommended for long-term forecasts as well as for new services 
[2]. The model and the values employed are based on a compilation.
The demand model is defined by the following expression:
ct bta
Y
))exp(1( 


(4)
where Yt is the demand forecasted at time t and M is the saturation level of the 
penetration which is estimated a-priori. The parameters a, b and c are be estimated by 
a stepwise procedure, attempting to value these parameters using non-linear 
regression and data from of external reports and market surveys.
Selected Cases Studies
In the second part of this thesis the methodology has been applied in case studies for 
3G networks as well as fixed wireless and wireline access (including FTTx solutions). 
For these case studies the real option theory has been applied, in order to clearly 
define the uncertainty of the investment. In addition, a game theory approach for a 
competition model between an incumbent and a newcomer operator has been 
analyzed. Finally the technoeconomic tool has been used, for the definition of a viable 
approach, for the provision of broadband services in less competitive areas in Greece, 
including sensitivity and risk analysis.
The financial perspective of the mobile networks in Europe
This case study presents a techno-economic evaluation of 3G roll-out scenarios in two 
“typical” European countries with contrasting profiles, analyzing both the incumbent 
and newcomers business cases. The analysis is based on the techno-economic 
methodology developed within this thesis. Market and tariff forecasts as well as the 
technological evolutionary paths are discussed and financial figures are analyzed. 
Sensitivity analysis follows these basic results in order to identify the impact of 
uncertainties and risks. The success of such an investment project is mainly depended 
on the regulatory framework, demand and tariff structure and the market share.
Fig. 2a illustrates these different evolution paths. While the intermediate steps are 
overlaid onto a GSM network, UMTS requires full buildout of the radio access 
subsystem. Incumbent operators may, however, re-use existing GSM sites. This is a 
major advantage for an incumbent operator in order to provide advanced multimedia 
mobile services.

to base value (4,961 M€) in case of large country both for Incumbent (I) and Greenfield (G) 
case [5]
The techno-economic prospects for a new entrant and especially for an incumbent 
operator planning to deploy the UMTS technology are found to be positive according 
to the base scenarios of this study. However, after investigating the sensitivity of NPV
(Fig. 2 b) to factors such as market share, tariffs, license costs, and base station costs, 
we draw the reader’s attention to potential pitfalls. Specifically, the following 
elements were identified to have major consequences on the profitability of this new 
business:
 Regulatory decision to promote competition: By deciding to open the UMTS 
market to at least four competing operators, regulators are hoping that the 
competitive dynamics will work to offer the widest range of services to the most 
customers possible at least cost. However, overcrowding leading to an end market 
share of 10% results in negative NPV for both the incumbent and greenfield 
operators. Conversely, NPV is improved by 1,200 M€ for a 5% increase in market 
share in 2009.
 Cost of licenses: License fee and therefore the license assignation mechanism 
(auction or comparative hearings) can seriously deteriorate the business case since 
the payback period can be delayed by more than a year, together with significantly 
decreasing NPV. License fee increasing from 10 to 150 €/inhabitant decreases the 
NPV by 66% for the incumbent. 
 Tariffing of voice and data services: The tariff level ranks first over service 
penetration and market share as the most significant factor for UMTS profitability.  
This result seems logical since, in NPV calculation, the tariff level directly impacts 
total revenues, whereas the other parameters affect the number of customers, and 
hence the costs. Nonetheless, it must not be construed that operators are free to 
hike tariffs as they wish to achieve a positive result. Indeed, the competitive 
context and dropping prices for fixed network services will severely limit their 
room to maneuver in this area.
 Investment schedule: Since operators deploy the radio network, using a coverage 
rather capacity approach (mainly due to license obligation) the cost of BTS 
equipment incurs a heavy financial burden. Although increased BTS cost has 
limited impact, it leads to larger investments in the pre-service year. 
In conclusion, UMTS operators will have not very much latitude to roll out their 
networks. Heavy investments are required early on in order to cover the most dense 
areas, and then once again for the suburban areas. Competitive pressure will keep 
tariff levels low, and operators will need to consolidate their market assumptions with 
extreme care in order to evaluate the payback period. Lastly, they must have enough 
financial resources to stay in debt for a long period of time.
Advanced Access Networks – Use of Real Options Approach
The following case is examined: an incumbent operator offering existing services 
over twisted copper pairs such as POTS, ISDN and dial-up based Internet service, 
starts offering wideband and broadband services in 2000 using his existing copper 
plant. At some future date, the operator may decide to install fibre closer to the 
customers and thereby be able to increase customer reach and offer more advanced 
services over VDSL. The investment problem is illustrated in Fig. 3a.

cases
The four selected strategies are: Dense Urban, FTTCab, Dense Urban, FTTC 
Suburban, FTTExch-FTTCab-FTTC (Suburban FTTC (i)) and Suburban, FTTN-
FTTC (Suburban FTTC (ii)) The calculated Cash flows of the four operator strategies 
are shown in Fig. 3b.
In a dense urban area, the initial coverage of high-speed ADSL and VDSL services is 
quite high due to the short average loop length compared to a suburban area. The 
difference between the investments for the FTTCab and FTTC strategy is balanced by 
the difference in revenues. The NPVs of the four rollout strategies, when using a 
traditional approach, are calculated as 13.1, 13.2, -0.1 and 1.6 MEURO respectively. 
The Suburban FTTC (i) would therefore be rejected. Moving to the discussion in the 
introduction, we now turn to the assessment of the alternatives using the methodology 
of Real Options. First, the cash flows and their constituencies (revenues, investments 
etc.) are divided into two phases as in explained in [7][8][9]: the cash flows that stem 
from the initial service offering and the cash flows that result directly from a fibre 
upgrade. These phases will be denoted Phase 1 and Phase 2 respectively in the 
following discussion. An adjusted NPV for Phase 2 (and therefore the whole project) 
that includes the value of the flexibility in timing of the upgrade and the time value of 
money is calculated by the use of Black-Scholes [8] formula for European call option 
as described in [10]. The total project NPV is then calculated as the sum of the NPV 
of Phase 1 and the adjusted NPV of Phase 2. In order to find the value of the option of 
investment deferral, five parameters are required. These five parameters which are 
normally used in the calculation of financial call options are summarized in Table 1
along with their “interpretation” in an investment context.

The Suburban FTTC (i) strategy was used for the example. As seen, the adjusted NPV 
is positive compared to the negative NPV obtained from the “traditional” NPV 
method! The decision not to go for the investment is therefore changed to: invest in 
FTTCab now – then wait a few years – and then invest in FTTC! Fig. 4 shows the 
traditional NPVs compared to adjusted NPVs with volatilities of 40% and 60% for the 
Suburban FTTC strategies:

In the FTTC (i) strategy, the decision is changed as already mentioned. For a 
volatility of 60% the NPV is 0.77 MEURO compared to the –0.1 MEURO using the 
traditional approach! In the FTTC (ii) strategy, the change in NPV is 22% and 55% 
respectively for the two values of volatility. If a traditional NPV methodology had 
been used, the broadband project would not have been initiated at all with the given 
assumptions because the NPV of Phase 1 is negative. The uncertainty, here described 
by the volatility, always has a “good” and a “bad” side. If for example the demand for 
new services turn out to grow faster than expected, equipment prices drop faster than 
expected etc., investment is considered. Otherwise, the investment decision is 
deferred. In cases where the sign is not changed when using Real Options, significant 
improvements in NPV can still be obtained due to value of the built in option. In the 
FTTC (ii) case with volatility of 60%, the built in option of this project (the value of 
the call option minus the traditional Phase 2 NPV) is even exceeding the traditional 
NPV of the whole project.
A Game Theory modeling approach for 3G Operators
This case study presents the technoeconomic evaluation of a 3G rollout scenario 
followed by the identification of the market conditions for two operators in a simple 
game theory model. The considered scenarios reflect the point of view of both 
dominant operators and new entrants. Technoeconomic results are presented in terms 
of net present value (NPV), acting like the pay-off function in the proposed 
theoretical Game Theory model.
The calculations were based on two main inputs from the TE model results (case 1 of 
this paper) and the hypothetical (empirical) market parameters. TE model served as 
the main root for calculating inputs of our calculations. So we accepted all the 
suppositions built into the TE model, and different models for “incumbent” and 
“newcomer” were prepared. We followed the 10-years time horizon, and naturally all 
the investments, costs and revenue figures. All the other basic parameters were set to 
illustrate an “average western European case”. 
To be able to calculate the pay-off, two important parameters were picked up, namely:
 The market share and
 the price
Within the Eurescom P901 (EURESCOM 2001) an improved model for the definition 
of the market behavior have been proposed. A general “S-like” curve was supposed, 
with three (3) sort of market behavior regarding price-reaction of customers. This 
kind of function stands for both companies, but with different parameters. In our 
calculation market function is built from the newcomer operator (player 2) point of 
view. All the parameters refer to the newcomer. The Market Share of the new comer 
is given by:

Fig. 5 Data Flow between TE Tool and Game Theory Tables.
For each point define by a specific tariff policy via the tariff multipliers exist one 
market share for each player (player1 – incumbent, player 2 – new comer). In the next 
step for each value of the tariff multiplier and market share one value of NPV per 
player can been calculated by the TE tool (NPVPL1 and NPVPL2). These NPVs values 
are stored in a cell, consist as a step for the players for Gambit Tool. The process 
continues until all cells completed with NPVs values, (last step [TMPL1, TMPL2]=[1.5, 
1.5]). These results are basically all the sensitivity results for all combinations. The 
process will be repeated for all defined market types Insensible-Small, Medium, 
High], [Average-Small, Medium, High] και [Sensible-Small, Medium, High], 9 times 
in total.
The following tables (in B€) show the results reached by calculating pay-off functions 
and in addition the Nash-equilibrium points are illustrated. Each cell contains two 
figures. The first column is the tariff multiplier of player 1 (PL1) and the first row 
belongs to player 2 (PL2). Each cell defined by the tariff multipliers contains two 
values. The first value is the NPV of Operator 1 (NPVPL1) and the second is the NPV 
of Operator 2 (NPVPL2) for a specific tariff policy. (i.e. First cell [0.5, 0.5] means 50% 
reduction in tariff compared to the base tariff for both players and NPVPL1=9.9B€, 
NPVPL2=2.2 B€.). The “position” of each player can be improved if its financial result 
is higher. The crossings of the vertical and horizontal colored differently cells show 
the Nash-equilibrium points. The Nash-equilibrium points are bordered differently 
and so do strategies of competitors bound to the equilibrium. In case of having 
solutions with mixed strategies probabilities of specific strategies, these are put at the 
end of rows or columns (i.e. Table 2 82% and 12% probability). Important to notice 
that these strategy combinations and equilibrium points should be seen as being Nash-
sense, and even if we might speak about strategy likely to be followed, the general 
meaning of this, is different from i.e. “dominant strategy”.

Having Nash-sense equilibrium practically means both competitors play their best 
strategy, related to the other strategies selected. This can be done only in such a way, 
that players know each other’s strategy in advance. Within limits, this could be a real 
situation. Formation of mixed strategies as solutions means that unambiguous or 
simple strategies do not exist in order to reach equilibrium. Of course, the reader 
might define other kind of equilibrium condition than Nash-sense, e.g. managers may 
be interested in strategy being “the best” independently of other players’ strategy-
selection, or what happens if all the other players work the ruin of the others. In the 
first case we can reach “dominant strategy” and in the second we would have in our 
hands “the safe strategy”, both being a kind of equilibrium. 
Falling back on our Nash-equilibrium points, and having mixed strategy solutions, the 
operators should play on a “statistical base”, and choose strategies relying on 
numerical possibilities. As this seems to be rather “unrealistic”, operators would 
likely follow a strategy of higher probability value. Quite independently of initial 
market share of the newcomer and type of market, newcomer has to have always 
smaller prices, as the market analyzer might feel that this is “natural”. In most of our 
results this offers quite small tariffs compared to the incumbent operator’s ones.
As initial market share of newcomer increases, both competitors should decrease their 
prices, but regarding our inelastic total market models, incumbent always has a 
chance of having “the highest” price, being viable at the same time (quite positive 
NPV). It is interesting that with increasing sensibility of the market the solutions exist 
only with mixed strategies. This means that the mutual impact of competitors on each 
other, assumes that players have investigated what the other player does, deeply into 
statistical decision making “process”.
Conclusions
Concluding, investments in telecommunication technology can develop a new market 
area and expand traditional options for new players. Any business modelling should 
be accompanied by technoeconomic evaluation in order to give readers insights into 
the financial perspective and viability of a telecommunication investment project. In 
addition real options approach should be a complement to existing capital-budgeting 
systems and NOT a substitute of them. Game theory should be followed in order to
have a better understanding of the competition as it effect on the financial perspective 
of the telecommunication projects.
