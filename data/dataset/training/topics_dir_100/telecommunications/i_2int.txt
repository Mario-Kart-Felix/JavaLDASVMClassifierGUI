Data Communication vs Networking
! Communication: Two Nodes. Mostly EE issues.
! Networking: Two or more nodes. More issues, e.g., 
routing

Distributed Systems vs Networks
! Distributed Systems: 
! Users are unaware of underlying structure. 
E.g., trn instead of \n\bone\0\trn
! Mostly operating systems issues.  
! Nodes are generally under one organization’s 
control.
! Networks: Users specify the location of resources. 
http:\\www.cse.wustl.edu\~jain\
! Nodes are autonomous.

! Modem is used to transmit/receive digital information 
over analog phone system

Types of Networks (Cont)
! Enterprise vs Telecom Networks
Ethernet is the most common interface in Enterprise
Frame relay and ATM are common in Telecom Networks
! Local Area Networks (LAN)  0-2 km, Single Ownership
Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) 2-50 km,  
Wide Area Networks (WAN) 50+ km
! Telecom Networks:
! Access: Between subscriber and the service provider
! Metro: Covering a city
! Core: Between cities

OSI vs TCP/IP
2-21
©2005 Raj JainCSE473sWashington University in St. Louis
OSI vs TCP Reference Models
! OSI introduced concept of services, interface, 
protocols. These were force-fitted to TCP later 
⇒ It is not easy to replace protocols in TCP. 
! In OSI, reference model was done before protocols.
In TCP, protocols were done before the model
! OSI: Standardize first, build later
TCP: Build first, standardize later
! OSI took too long to standardize. 
TCP/IP was already in wide use by the time.
! OSI became too complex.
! TCP/IP is not general. Ad hoc.
