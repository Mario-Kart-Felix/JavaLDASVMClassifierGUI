Welcome to IET Journals 2016
With its expanding coverage of engineering, science and technology content, IET Publishing continues to provide academics and practising engineers with a wealth of high-quality resources for their research and information. 
IET letters, research and open access journals comprehensively cover the disciplines of electrical engineering, and electronics, 
computing, control, biomedical, healthcare and communications technologies. A new venture with the Chinese Institute of 
Electronics sees the addition of the Chinese Journal of Electronics to our listing for the first time (read more on page 4).
As part of our continuing commitment to support the international engineering community, we continue to develop our 
author-care programme. By working with the likes of Editage and Kudos, the provision of author urls for the distribution of 
published work, and the imminent addition of ‘publication upon acceptance’, we are improving the publishing experience 
for the international researcher, and ensuring our journals remain relevant to the community. 
Our newest journal, Healthcare Technology Letters, has been fully accepted to PubMed Central, with 
content listing from September 2015.
What else is new?
Ever increasing quality
As a mark of the high quality of our journal content, most of them 
are already indexed by the likes of Scopus, Ei Compendex, Google 
Scholar, SCI, SCI-E and IET Inspec, to name a few. As a result, we are 
confident when we say that our journals should be an essential part 
of any serious academic library. 
The latest journals to be indexed include Healthcare Technology 
Letters, now in PubMed Central and, along with IET Networks, also 
indexed by Scopus. 
Thanks to the continuing efforts and support of our editorial boards, 
and the growing number of high-quality paper submissions, we have 
increased the frequency of some journals. 
Frequency increases:
 n IET Computer Vision now 8 issues – up from 6
 n IET Power Electronics now 15 issues – up from 12
 n IET Renewable Power Generation now 10 issues – up from 8
Impact Factors:
More than half of our journals increased their Impact Factors, with 
significant increases of over 25%, on the last year, for IET Computer 
Vision, IET Power Electronics, IET Science, Measurement and 
Technology and IET Signal Processing. In addition, IET Biometrics 
has its first Impact Factor of 0.857.
a growing collection of resources
We are continually building our resources 
for researchers, academics and practising 
engineers and in addition to an extensive 
programme of journals, books and 
magazine publishing we also have:
 n The Conference Collection: a broad 
range of technical content and 
conference proceedings, from events 
organised by the IET and other 
international organisations.
 n IET.tv: one of the world’s largest 
collections of authoritative and 
multidisciplinary video content covering 
a range of engineering topics and 
expertise. With more than 6,500 
presentations, lectures and training 
videos, this high quality resource is 
proving invaluable for researchers, 
lecturers and students.
 n Engineering & Technology reference 
(E&Tr): a new world-class collection of 
multidisciplinary technical articles and 
real-industry case studies.
