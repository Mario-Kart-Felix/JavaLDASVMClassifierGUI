Introduction
 Most modern telecommunication systems 
transfer information in digital format.
 3
Introduction (Continued)
 The information may consist of voice, video, 
computer data, etc.

Essential Components
 Essential components of a modern 
communication system include:
1. Computers (for information processing)
2. Input/output devices to send or receive data
 Input devices: keyboard, microphone, video camera, 
computer storage devices, etc.
 Output devices: display, printer, speakers, storage media
3. Communication channels: 
 telephone lines, coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, wireless 
links etc.

Essential Compâ€¦.(Continued)
4. Supporting hardware to connect heterogeneous 
subnetworks:
 Modems, multiplexers, routers, etc.
5. Communications software

Communication Channels
1. Twisted wires:
 The oldest transmission medium
 Low cost
 Relatively slow for data transmission
2. Coaxial Cable:
 Consists of thickly insulated copper wire
 Can transmit larger amount of data
 Faster than twisted wire
3. Fiber Optics Cables:
1. Consists of thousands of strands of clear glass 
fiber

Communication Channels (Continued)
2. Thickness of the glass fiber is as small as the 
thickness of a human hair
3. Data is transmitted into pulses of light
4. More suitable for providing high-speed backbone 
network
 Advantages:
1. Lighter and more durable that coaxial cable and twisted 
wire
2. Can handle a very large volume of data
 Disadvantages:
1. Difficult to work with
2. Relatively expensive
 8
Communication Channels (Continued)
1. Wireless links:
 Data (information) is transmitted through 
atmosphere via electro-magnetic waves

Network Topologies
 Star Topology:
 10
Network Topologies: Star
 All computers in a star network are connected to 
each other through a host computer
 Host computer directs the incoming messages to 
the correct destination computer
 If the host computer goes down it affects the 
operation of whole star network
 Individual computer can be brought down for 
maintenance or removed without affecting the rest 
of the star network
 11
Network Topologies (Continued)
 Bus network:
 12
Network Topologies: Bus 
 All computers are connected through a common 
line (could be a twisted wire, coaxial cable, fiber 
optics cable etc.)
 Each message is broadcasted in both directions 
to the entire network
 If a computer goes down, it does not affect the 
rest of the network
 Bus network handles one message at a time
 If two or more computers send messages 
simultaneously a collision occurs, the messages 
must be re-sent   
 13
Network Topologies (Continued)
 Token Ring Network:
 14
Network Topologies: Token Ring
 In a ring network, computers are connected via a 
closed loop wired connection
 Data is transmitted in one direction  
 A token is passed through the ring and any 
computer in need of transmitting the data holds 
the token and starts transmitting the message
 The computer with the delivery address receives 
the data
 When the message arrives at the source 
computer it signals the completion of the 
transmission
 15
Network Topologies: Token Ring
 The computer holding the token then passes the  
token to the next computer
 If the next computer needs to send the data it will 
hold the token and start transmitting the message; 
otherwise, it will pass the token to the next 
computer
 16
Local Area Network (LAN)
 Local area network covers a limited area such 
as a building or a few buildings in a close 
proximity
 17
LAN (Continued)
 LAN generally use Bus or Ring topology
 Usually connects computer and related equipment 
with in 2000 feet radius
 Often used to connect PCs/workstation to shared 
printers and file-servers etc.
 A special computer known as network gateway 
connects the LAN to other networks
 Both wired and wireless LAN technologies are 
available  
 Wide area networks (WAN) span a large 
geographical area and contain thousands of LANs 
and other heterogeneous networks in an entire 
continents
 18
Enterprise Networking
 An enterprise network connects PCs, workstations, 
NCs, LANs, and other organization-wide computing 
resources together as well as to Internet
