Introduction
Wireless technology has helped to simplify
networking by enabling multiple computer
users to simultaneously share resources 
in a home or business without additional or 
intrusive wiring. These resources might include
a broadband Internet connection, network
printers, data files, and even streaming audio
and video. This kind of resource sharing has
become more prevalent as computer users
have changed their habits from using single,
stand-alone computers to working on networks
with multiple computers, each with potentially
different operating systems and varying
peripheral hardware. U.S. Robotics wireless
networking products offer a variety of solutions
to seamlessly integrate computers, peripherals,
and data.
Wireless networking enables the same capabilities
and comparable speeds of a wired 10BASE-T
network without the difficulties associated with
laying wire, drilling into walls, or stringing
Ethernet cables throughout an office building
or home. Laptop users have the freedom to
roam anywhere in the office building or home
without having to hunt down a connector cable
or available jack. Every room in a wireless home
or office can be “connected” to the network, 
so adding more users and growing a network
can be as simple as installing a new wireless
network adapter. 
Reasons to choose wireless networking over
traditional wired networks include:
• Running additional wires or drilling new
holes in a home or office could be prohibited
(because of rental regulations), impractical
(infrastructure limitations), or too expensive
• Flexibility of location and data ports is required
• Roaming capability is desired; e.g., maintaining
connectivity from almost anywhere inside a
home or business
• Network access is desired outdoors; e.g.,
outside a home or office building
Wireless LANs in the Office
An 802.11 network is the ideal solution for a
network administrator in many respects. No
longer is it a requirement that every workstation
and conference room be wired up to hubs and
switches with cables in hard-to-reach areas.
Wireless networking allows for impromptu
meetings in cafeterias, hallways, courtyards, 
or wherever inspiration strikes while providing
real-time LAN connectivity for business 
applications such as sending e-mail, working
on spreadsheets on shared drives, and 
conducting market research.
Wireless LANs in the Home
Wireless networking has become commonplace,
and with prices reduced to a fraction of what
they were, it is no wonder that wireless 
networking products have transitioned from
the office and into the home. For the home
user, a wireless network provides freedom in
convenience and lifestyle to exchange words,
data, and music or video with any computer –
across the Internet, or around the world.
Home users can create a wireless network out
of an existing wired network and wirelessly
extend the reach of the Internet throughout
the home on multiple computers, making it
more convenient for everyone to get online.

Wireless LAN Networking 
White Paper
IEEE Wireless Networking
Specifications 
The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers) released the 802.11 specifications 
in June 1999. The initial specification, known
as 802.11, used the 2.4 GHz frequency and
supported a maximum data rate of 1 to 2 Mbps.
In late 1999, two new addenda were released.
The 802.11b specification increased the 
performance to 11 Mbps in the 2.4 GHz range
while the 802.11a specification utilized the 
5 GHz range and supported up to 54 Mbps. 
Unfortunately, the two new specifications 
were incompatible because they used different
frequencies. This means that 802.11a network
interface cards (NICs) and access points 
cannot communicate with 802.11b NICs and
access points. This incompatibility forced the
creation of the new draft standard known as
802.11g. 802.11g supports up to 54 Mbps and
is interoperable with 802.11b products on the
market today. The concern is that the 802.11g
specification is currently in development and
products will not be available until a later date.
802.11 Specifications
The 802.11 specifications were developed
specifically for Wireless Local Area Networks
(WLANs) by the IEEE and include four subsets
of Ethernet-based protocol standards: 802.11,
802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g.
802.11
802.11 operated in the 2.4 GHz range and was
the original specification of the 802.11 IEEE 
standard. This specification delivered 1 to 2 Mbps
using a technology known as phase-shift keying
(PSK) modulation. This specification is no longer
used and has largely been replaced by other
forms of the 802.11 standard.
802.11a
802.11a operates in the 5 - 6 GHz range with
data rates commonly in the 6 Mbps, 12 Mbps,
or 24 Mbps range. Because 802.11a uses the
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing
(OFDM) standard, data transfer rates can be 
as high as 54 Mbps. OFDM breaks up fast 
serial information signals into several slower
sub-signals that are transferred at the same
time via different frequencies, providing more
resistance to radio frequency interference. The
802.11a specification is also known as Wi-Fi5,
and though regionally deployed, it is not a
global standard like 802.11b. 
802.11b
The 802.11b standard (also known as Wi-Fi)
operates in the 2.4 GHz range with up to 
11 Mbps data rates and is backward compatible
with the 802.11 standard. 802.11b uses a 
technology known as complementary code
keying (CCK) modulation, which allows for
higher data rates with less chance of multi-path
propagation interference (duplicate signals
bouncing off walls). 
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps 802.11b
Recent developments to 802.11b have seen
numerous improvements to this well-established
and widely-deployed wireless standard. New
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps products are designed
to support Packet Binary Convolutional Coding
(PBCC) in addition to CCK modulation. This
not only increases performance but also 
maintains complete 802.11b compatibility with
both 11 Mbps and 22 Mbps products. The 
overall benefits include:
• Up to twice the data rate of conventional 
11 Mbps 802.11b standard products
• Greater WLAN coverage: up to 70% greater
than standard 11 Mbps 802.11b products
• Full interoperability with all 802.11b products:
works with 802.11b 11 Mbps, 802.11b 
22 Mbps, and upcoming 802.11g products
• Improved security over standard 802.11b:
256-bit WEP encryption and MAC address
authentication*
802.11g
802.11g is the most recent IEEE 802.11 draft
standard and operates in the 2.4 GHz range
with data rates as high as 54 Mbps over a limited
distance. It is also backward compatible with
802.11b and will work with both 11 and 22 Mbps
U.S. Robotics wireless networking products.
802.11g offers the best features of both 802.11a
and 802.11b, but as of the publication date of
this document, this standard has not yet been
certified, and therefore is unavailable. 
2
* MAC address authentication available with U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Access Point and 
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Router.
All four standards are based on the CSMA/CA
(Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Avoidance) Ethernet protocol for path sharing.
The most significant contribution of the 802.11
specification is that it allows for interoperability
among different vendors’ equipment. Thanks
to the Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance
(WECA), 802.11 standard equipment will 
work together interchangeably, regardless 
of the manufacturer.
Different WLAN Technologies
As various wireless networking technologies
have advanced over time, several WLAN 
technologies have emerged, including: 
narrowband, spread spectrum, frequency 
hopping spread spectrum, and direct 
sequence spread spectrum.
Narrowband 
As the name suggests, narrowband technology
uses a specific radio frequency (in the range
of 50 cps to 64 Kbps) for data transmission.
Spread Spectrum 
Originally developed for military use, spread
spectrum technology allows for greater 
bandwidth by continually altering the frequency
of the transmitted signal, thus spreading the
transmission across multiple frequencies.
Spread spectrum uses more bandwidth than
narrowband, but the transmission is more
secure, reliable, and easier to detect.
Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
(FHSS)
Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
technology synchronizes the changing frequency
of both the transmitter and receiver (using a
narrowband carrier) to, in effect, produce a 
single transmission signal. This frequency
“hopping” can occur as often as several times
a second; it is constantly changing from one
frequency to another, transmitting data for a
certain period of time before changing frequency
again. Like spread spectrum technology, FHSS
technology consumes additional bandwidth,
however, this is over the course of multiple 
carrier frequencies.
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum
(DSSS)
Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 
technology breaks down the transmitted
stream of data into small pieces across a 
frequency channel. A redundant bit pattern
(known as a chipping code) is generated for
each bit transmitted. Generally, the longer the
chipping code, the more likely it is that the
original transmitted data will be properly
received. DSSS technology uses more bandwidth
than FHSS, but DSSS is considered more reliable
and resists interference. Because of the chipping
code, data can still be recovered without
retransmission of the signal, even in the case
of damaged data bits. U.S. Robotics wireless
networking products utilize DSSS technology.
Wireless LAN Frequency Usage 
The 802.11b standard defines 14 frequency
channels for use with this technology. Depending
on the country a user lives in and where he or
she will be installing a WLAN, there are certain
governmental restrictions for companies offering
these products and consumers or businesses
deploying these products.
In North America, the FCC (Federal
Communications Commission) and IC
(Industry Canada) allow manufacturers and
users to use channels 1 through 11, per ETSI
approval (European Telecommunications
Standards Institute); most of Europe can use
channels 1 through 13, while in Japan, users
have all 14 channels available.

Even though there are 14 channel frequencies
available for use, it should be noted that the
actual channel frequency indicates the “center
frequency” used by the transmitter and receiver
for communication. An 802.11b radio signal
consumes approximately 30 MHz of frequency
spectrum, leaving a 5 MHz separation between
center frequencies. This means that the 
signal extends out 15 MHz of the center 
frequency spectrum. 
As a result, the bandwidth required for each
channel signal overlaps several adjacent 
frequencies. This leaves the typical U.S. user
with three channels available for use by access
points (channels 1, 6, and 11) that are within
radio range of adjacent access points. 
Ad Hoc (Peer-to-Peer) Mode vs.
Infrastructure Mode
The 802.11 specification defines two types 
of operational modes: ad hoc (peer-to-peer)
mode and infrastructure mode. In ad hoc
mode, the wireless network is relatively simple
and consists of 802.11 network interface cards
(NICs). The networked computers communicate
directly with one another without the use of an
access point. In infrastructure mode, the wireless
network is composed of a wireless access point(s)
and 802.11 network interface cards (NICs). The
access point acts as a base station in an 802.11
network and all communications from all of the
wireless clients go through the access point.
The access point also provides for increased
wireless range, growth of the number of 
wireless users, and additional network security.
Ad Hoc Mode
In ad hoc mode, also known as Independent
Basic Service Set (IBSS) or peer-to-peer mode,
all of the computers and workstations connected
with a wireless NIC card can communicate with
each other via radio waves without an access
point. Ad hoc mode is convenient for quickly
setting up a wireless network in a meeting
room, hotel conference center, or anywhere else
sufficient wired infrastructure does not exist.

Figure 4 – Ad hoc mode
Infrastructure Mode
In infrastructure mode, all mobile and wireless
client devices and computers communicate with
the access point, which provides the connection
from the wireless radio frequency world to 
the hard-wired LAN world. The access point
performs the conversion of 802.11 packets 
to 802.3 Ethernet LAN packets. Data packets
traveling from the LAN to a wireless client are
converted by the access point into radio signals
and transmitted out into the environment. All
wireless clients and devices within range can
receive the packets, but only those clients with
the appropriate destination address will receive
and process the packets. 
A basic wireless infrastructure with a single
access point is called a Basic Service Set (BSS).
When more than one access point is connected
to a network to form a single sub-network, it
is called an Extended Service Set (ESS).
The 802.11 specification includes roaming
capabilities that allow a client computer to
roam among multiple access points on different
channels. Thus, roaming client computers with
weak signals can associate themselves with
other access points with stronger signals.
Alternately, by setting up multiple access points
to cover the same geographic area and by
using different non-overlapping frequencies, 
client workstation networking loads can be
better balanced. A wireless LAN NIC may decide
to “reassociate” itself with another access point
within range because the load on its current
access point is too high for optimal performance.
These capabilities can have a positive impact on
overall network performance.

Wireless Network Components
Much like a traditional wired LAN, a WLAN 
is a grouping of computers and peripheral
devices that share a common communications
backbone. As is implied by the name, a WLAN
allows users to connect to the LAN wirelessly
via radio transmission. The following are the
most common components of a WLAN.
Access Point 
The access point is a device that links a 
wireless network to a wired LAN. It increases
the effective range of a wireless network and
provides additional network management and
security features. Wireless networks of three or
fewer PCs do not require an access point for
ad hoc networking. Access points are useful
for larger networks, and they are particularly
well-suited for adding wireless capability to an
existing wired network.
The U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Access
Point connects via an RJ-45 cable to a LAN
and can support up to 20 wireless users at 
an effective range of up to 1500 feet in open
spaces. It also enables additional security 
features such as MAC address authentication. 
PC Card
A wireless PC card enables laptop users to
connect wirelessly to the LAN. U.S. Robotics
22 Mbps Wireless PC Cards allow for ad 
hoc networking of up to three computers 
at an effective range of up to 1000 feet in 
open spaces 
PCI Adapter
Just as a wireless access PC card allows portable
and laptop computers access to the LAN, a 
wireless access PCI adapter allows desktop PC
users access to the LAN. U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps
Wireless PCI Adapters allow for ad hoc 
networking of up to three computers at an 
effective range of up to 1000 feet in open spaces.
Router
A router is a device used for sharing a single
Internet connection across multiple computers.
This is ideal in the home or office where 
multiple computers and devices can be online
at the same time with only a single Internet
connection. The U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps
Wireless Cable/DSL Router includes built-in
wireless access point capabilities.
Wireless networking users should keep the 
following in mind:
• One wireless PC card (U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps
Wireless PC Card, model 2210) is needed 
for each laptop and one wireless PCI adapter
(U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapter,
model 2215 or 2216) is needed for each 
desktop computer to be wirelessly networked.
• An ad hoc network of up to three computers
can be created with wireless PC cards or PCI
adapters. To connect more than three com-
puters, include an access point or router
(U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Access
Point, model 2249, or U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps
Wireless Cable/DSL Router, model 8022) in
the network design.
• Ad hoc wireless networks using U.S. Robotics
22 Mbps wireless networking products have
an effective range of up to 300 feet in any
direction, indoors or out, and even on different
levels of a building. As with any wireless
product, ad hoc networks work best when
closer together and in an open environment.
• Wireless networks that use either a 
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Access 
Point or a U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless
Cable/DSL Router have an effective 
range of up to 1500 feet, with the same 
considerations as ad hoc networks.
• Sharing Internet access among multiple 
computers or laptops requires a router. The
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL
Router is capable of supporting up to 253
clients (with additional hardware) for wired
and wireless Internet sharing.

WLAN Performance
Much the same way a cordless phone works
better when it is close to its base, wirelessly
networked computers function best when
located relatively close together and in open
sight of each other. The level of performance
of an 802.11 WLAN is dependent on a number
of important environmental and product-specific
factors. Access points will automatically negotiate
the appropriate signaling rate based upon
environmental conditions, such as:
• Distance between WLAN devices 
(AP and NICs)
• Transmission power levels
• Building and home materials
• Radio frequency interference
• Signal propagation
• Antenna type and location
Depending on environmental specifics, automatic
downshifting by the access point or client
allows compatibility adjustment to prevailing
radio frequency conditions. At any one
moment, an 802.11b network can be running
at 11 Mbps, 5.5 Mbps, 2 Mbps, or 1 Mbps 
22 Mbps wireless networking products). And
depending on where each wireless device is 
in a home or office, each of those devices can
be transmitting at any one of these speeds.
Typically, the software applications that ship
with an 802.11 NIC adapter are capable of
reporting current connection speeds and also
allow users to perform site surveys for the 
best location of an access point.
The diagram below shows how distance and
building materials can impact the performance
of an 802.11 network.

(Access Points and NICs)
Typically, published wireless range claims are
for line-of-sight or open area environments
such as cafeterias, auditoriums, or other areas
that lack interference-causing obstacles. The
following chart provides a quick comparison
of conventional 802.11b wireless products against
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps wireless products in 
a real-world application with typical levels 
of interference and common obstructions, 
such as walls and other physical barriers.
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps maximum sustainable
throughput is clearly superior to that of
standard 11 Mbps 802.11b. 
Products designed to work with the 802.11a
standard have a faster data rate, but the signal
is limited in distance and susceptible to 
environmental conditions like rain and fog.
Because of these limitations, 802.11a products
are more practical for indoor applications, will
most likely require additional access points for
proper area coverage, and will achieve lower
data rates than the maximum allowed.
Transmit Power Levels
Most WLAN devices have a power output of
only 30 mW, which is far less then a typical
cellular phone or walkie-talkie. 
Power Consumption Levels
Most 802.11b NICs allow the user to customize
the power modes in the software drivers in
order to optimize WLAN performance versus
battery life for a notebook system.
Building and Home
Materials/Signal Propagation
The contents of a home or office building can
have a dramatic impact on the quality of the
signal obtained with an 802.11 wireless network.
The wood, metal, and other building materials
have a direct impact on signal propagation
and absorption. Other factors include:
• Multi-path interference: This occurs when 
signal strength and timing are altered due to
the signal reflecting off walls, filing cabinets,
beams, and other objects. This results in a
device receiving two or more identical signals. 
• Fading: Fading is the reduced amplitude of 
a signal as a result of passing through radio-
transparent objects such as walls and ceilings.
• Dead zones: Locations where radio signals
never reach due to reflections, obstructions,
or other environmental conditions.
The new 22 Mbps line of U.S. Robotics 
wireless networking products are specifically
designed for optimal use in the home with
minimal degradation in signal quality due 
to environmental conditions; U.S. Robotics
wireless products are designed to work
through walls instead of around them. 
Radio Frequency Interference
Varying amounts of radio interference exist all
around us. A savvy wireless user can minimize
this interference to maximize the performance
of his or her WLAN. But before a user can
begin to minimize these points of interference,
he or she must begin to recognize the more
common causes. 
The 802.11b standard uses the unlicensed
radio spectrum that is commonly shared by 
a variety of consumer devices: baby monitors
and cameras, 2.4 GHz cordless phones,
microwave ovens, and Bluetooth-enabled
devices like cellular phones or personal digital
assistants (PDAs). These devices transmit in
the 2.4 GHz range and can impact WLAN 
performance. DSSS technology, as used in 
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps wireless networking
products, is very effective at minimizing 
these types of interference. 
A quick scan around a user’s home or 
business will tell if there are any potential
problems. Using products designed to work 
in the 900 MHz frequency can help minimize
any interference and maximize the 
performance of any WLAN.

~2 Mbps @ 300 ft ~6 Mbps @ 300 ft
~1 Mbps @ 325 ft ~4.25 Mbps @ 325 ft
N/A ~4 Mbps @ 350 ft
Antenna Type and Location
There are two general types of antennas 
used for 802.11: directional and omnidirectional.
A directional antenna concentrates energy in 
a narrow conic path when sending and rejects
signals outside a single direction when receiving.
An omnidirectional antenna transmits in a 360o
arc and is capable of receiving signals from
any direction. Most 802.11b devices implement
an omnidirectional antenna. The antenna type
and location are important factors when 
setting up a wireless network. Users should
experiment with several locations for their
access point and antenna in order to determine
the optimal location for maximum performance. 
Aggregating Bandwidth
For businesses looking to increase performance
and for supporting dozens of devices in close
proximity, it is possible to overlap access
points to provide an aggregate bandwidth to
all of the wireless clients. This can be achieved
by setting the access points to non-overlapping
frequencies for the covered area. 
Bluetooth vs. 802.11b
Those unfamiliar with wireless technology
commonly confuse 802.11b and Bluetooth
technologies. Both technologies use the 
2.4 GHz radio frequency for wireless 
communications; however, the goal, focus, 
and concept of Bluetooth is different from
802.11b wireless networking.
Bluetooth technology is focused on replacing
the short cables used to connect consumer
electronic devices such as keyboards, mouse
devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs),
computers, printers, and cellular phones. This
type of close proximity connectivity is often
referred to as a Wireless Personal Area
Network (WPAN). 
Bluetooth devices differ from 802.11b in a
number of ways. Bluetooth is not a “true 
networking” standard in the manner that 
Wi-Fi is, and its range is limited to approxi-
mately 10 to 30 feet (3 m to 9.1 m) with a 
raw data rate of 1 Mbps/723 Kbps available.
Bluetooth also limits the maximum number 
of separate 1 MHz simultaneous connections
(devices) to seven at a single time. 
Since Wi-Fi was designed for higher through-
put and a multi-user environment, the two
technologies have their own unique places 
in home and office environments. Technical
details about Bluetooth are beyond the scope
of this document, and additional information
can be found at http://www.bluetooth.com.
Wireless Security
Security is an obvious concern with any network,
wired or wireless. Because communication over
a traditionally wired network is, by its very
nature, over physical wires, security is often
built into the physical environment itself. WLANs
operate over radio signals, so the same security
measures cannot be assumed. For many wireless
users, the enabling of the built-in security
known as Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is
sufficient for their home or small to medium
office WLAN. WEP uses 64- and 128-bit
encryption and is the cipher scheme designated
for use in 802.11b networking. U.S. Robotics
22 Mbps wireless products include enhanced
256-bit WEP encryption that is not commonly

private networks), WEP can be very effective.
For business and enterprise users, network
and data security is of the utmost concern. To
address this, there are a number of common
precautions that a WLAN user can take to limit
a network to hacker attacks, vandalism, and
corporate espionage.
Change Common Passwords Frequently:
Most of the top manufacturers have default
passwords for all of their equipment. Users
should be diligent in changing any default
passwords and to change them on a regular
basis in order to avoid detection. 
Limit MAC Addresses: Some access points
allow users to specify exactly which Media
Access Control (MAC) addresses can communi-
cate with the network. A MAC address is a
hardware address that uniquely identifies each
node of a network. Every network adapter in
the world has a unique MAC address. By
strictly specifying only those MAC addresses
that can attach to a network, unauthorized
users can be denied access.
Disable DHCP: By default, some access 
points respond directly to Dynamic Host
Configuration Protocol (DHCP) requests or
allow the forwarding of DHCP requests from
clients. DHCP is a protocol for assigning IP
addresses dynamically on a network. However,
with DHCP enabled on a WLAN, and without
proper security measures enabled, a user can
connect automatically to the network. 
Change Subnet Default: Some access points
default to the IP subnet of 192.168.x.x. When
disabling DHCP and using static IP addresses,
users should also change their default IP 
subnet value. 
Move Access Point in Front of Firewalls or
DMZs: The best solution for keeping prying
eyes away from a corporate network is to
move the access point off of the corporate
LAN and in front of a firewall or on a DMZ
(demilitarized zone) port. With the access
point in front of a firewall, intruders will 
not have access to the corporate LAN. All 
corporate wireless users will require the 
installation and use of a virtual private network
(VPN) client to create a secure tunnel into the
corporate LAN. This may require additional
administrative support from IT personnel, but 
the extra security is well worth the effort.
In addition to offering standard 64- and 128-bit
WEP encryption, the U.S. Robotics family of 
22 Mbps wireless products also offers the added
security of 256-bit encryption for improved
security over conventional 11 Mbps wireless
products to protect against hackers while
maintaining maximum performance. The 
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Access Point 
and 22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Router also
include the added security of built-in MAC
address authentication for even more local 
network protection.

U.S. Robotics Wireless Solutions
With the world's number-one selling modem
brand, U.S. Robotics has the most recognized
product line in its category within the Internet
access industry. Millions of computer users
around the globe first connected to the Internet
with a U.S. Robotics analog modem. U.S. Robotics
has extended its reputation for providing quality,
reliability, and technically innovative products
to a new line of wireless networking solutions
for home and office networking applications.
These new products include a complete family
of 22 Mbps wireless networking products 
that provide faster speeds, greater range, and 
better area coverage than conventional 
11 Mbps products.
U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps wireless networking
products are fully compatible with all IEEE
802.11b 11 Mbps and 22 Mbps wireless products
and will automatically adjust to the fastest rate
possible: 11 Mbps or 22 Mbps. This means that
networks can easily incorporate a combination
of both 11 Mbps and 22 Mbps wireless products.
In fact, all U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps wireless net-
working products are forward compatible and
designed to work with the upcoming 802.11g
standard when it becomes available. So, whether
a wireless client is using the latest 22 Mbps 
gear, a combination of 11 Mbps and 22 Mbps, 
or plans on adding the next standard when it
becomes available, U.S. Robotics wireless 
networking solutions can continue to play 
an integral role in any network.
For simple ad hoc networking of up to three
computers, a user simply installs the software,
plugs a U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless PCI
Adapter (Model 2215 or 2216) into each desktop
PC or a U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless PC
Card (Model 2210) into each laptop’s available
PC card slot, and starts sharing Internet access,
files, and printers at speeds up to 22 Mbps.
U.S. Robotics adapters can support any 
combination of up to three 22 Mbps Wireless
PC Cards and 22 Mbps Wireless PCI Adapters
when in ad hoc mode. Security is maintained
through 64-, 128-, and 256-bit Wired Equivalent
Privacy (WEP) encryption for improved security
over 11 Mbps wireless products.
For larger networks (up to 20 computers for
an Access Point or Wireless Router) and for
enhanced security features like MAC address
authentication, a U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless
Access Point (Model 2249) or a U.S. Robotics 
22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Router (Model 8022)
with built-in wireless access point can be added
easily to an existing LAN – wired or wireless. 
To network more than 20 computers, include
multiple U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Access
Points or 22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL Routers.
These two products increase the effective range
of a wireless network from 1000 feet to 1500 feet
in any direction – even outside or on different
levels of a building.
The U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps Wireless Cable/DSL
Router not only includes the functionality of 
a 22 Mbps Wireless Access Point, but it also
includes router capabilities for sharing high-speed
Internet access among multiple users spread
throughout a household or office building.
All U.S. Robotics 22 Mbps wireless networking
products offer numerous benefits and 
conveniences that can be applied to SOHO
(Small Office/Home Office) users, computing
environments requiring flexibility, and even
existing legacy networks. The IEEE 802 standard
supports the same network configuration options
of legacy Ethernet LANs, which allows for a
variety of applications and solutions.
U.S. Robotics continues to develop solutions to
provide data access to both business professionals
and home users. U.S. Robotics wireless networking
solutions are built upon proven technology and
backed by an organization that is committed to
the highest standards of product quality and
