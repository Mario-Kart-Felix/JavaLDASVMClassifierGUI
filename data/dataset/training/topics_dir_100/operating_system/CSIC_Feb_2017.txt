Computer Operating Systems: 
From every palm to the entire cosmos in the 21st Century Lifestyle
 Subrata Ganguli
  Formerly Asst. Prof., Department of Biotechnology, MVJ College of Engineering, Channasandra, Bangaluru, Karnataka
The operating system software is ubiquitous as the part and parcel of every computer in the age of 
information technology. One needs the operating systems far out in the cosmos inside the communication 
equipments used by the NASA and the ISRO in their shuttles and spacecraft, as well as in the palmed 
mobile sets so near to us that had changed everyday life in this 21st Century. Operating systems are 
required in the department of defense in their submarines operating outside the territory of the home 
government, as well as in the department of atomic energy in their nuclear projects secured in a safe 
location. Whether present inside the computers required for meteorological forecast and computations 
or in the computers associated with the World Wide Web and the Human Genome projects or inside 
the cheapest possible tablets in each backpack, they are the master software required for the running 
of the computers, however large or small. The niche and the operating conditions of the operating 
system software are thus as diverse as the computers themselves. This article describes and refers to 
the well known operating systems running the desk top computers and mobile cellular phones, their 
market shares and some projections for the future directions, hinting that the non-US economies such 
as Russia, China and India would assume a more domineering role in the global market for information 
technology beyond the year 2020.
Key Words: Operating systems, mobile operating systems, market share of operating systems, future projections.
Introduction:
Advent of high speed computation 
and the associated phenomenal growth 
in mobile technologies had impacted 
our daily living enhancing our ability 
to communicate with another object 
or individual in unthought-of ways. 
Mobile platforms are also being 
encouraged in research to avail the 
benefits of Digital India projects. The 
authors group had explored possible 
use of distributed systems and mobile 
technologies in learning and research 
that could possibly reduce the load on 
hard copy printing and in- built memory 
storage(1), an amateurish approach that 
had been validated as ‘cloud computing’ 
by computer professionals . Goal of this 
article is to draw attention to the various 
mobile, desktop and other computer 
operating systems available and their 
respective market share, that being 
considered an indirect measure of 
changes in life style.
All computer programs and the 
computational environment depend on 
a functional operating system  (OS) that 
manages hardware, other software, 
services and the users. It is the software 
when loaded onto the hardware that 
runs the environment of the machine, 
without which both the computer and 
the users are rendered useless.  The 
operating system (OS)  also can be 
directly accessed by the user through 
a command line or a graphical user 
interface (GUI) whereas the other 
programs, called  applications or 
application programs,  can make use of 
the OS through an application program 
interface (API) designed for specific 
applications
Silberschatz, Galvin and Peter (2) 
had described the computers being 
made up of four components – namely 
the hardware, the operating system, the 
application software and the users. The 
authors defined the operating system as 
“A program that acts as an intermediary 
between a user of a computer and the 
computer hardware”. The goals of the 
operating systems, according to these 
authors in the year 2008, are to execute 
user programs, to make solving user 
problems easier, thirdly, to make the 
computer system more convenient to 
use and finally, to use the computer 
hardware in an efficient manner.  The 
vast majority of the OS programs are 
usually written in C and C++ languages 
by experienced system programmers. 
Some of the OS source codes are open 
access and free, others are proprietary 
information of the companies that 
market them. 
Degree level courses on computer 
science and information technology 
require familiarity in handling the 
OS programs. One can look into 
the curriculum of the established 
foreign institutions for example, the 
University of Illinois (https://www.
cs . u i c . e d u / ~ j b e l l / C o u rs e N o te s /
OperatingSystems/), the MIT (https://
ocw.mit .edu/courses/electr ical-
engineering-and-computer-science/6-
828-operating-system-engineering-
fall-2012/), the Imperial College 
(http://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing/

the Stanford University (http://www.scs.
stanford.edu/09wi-cs140/).
Types of OS Currently Popular: 
The various operating systems 
had been popularly named by the 
companies that developed them (e.g. 
Windows, Android etc.) During technical 
discussion, OS’s are also referred to 
pointing out the functional features, 
or the size, structure and architecture 
of the computers they are housed in. 
Windows are maintaining the lion’s 
share in the field of desk top operating 
systems, whereas majority of mobile 
handsets use Android as the OS. The 
details of various operating systems are 
discussed in this issue of the Computer 
Society of India Communications, and 
elsewhere (https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Operating_system). A succinct and 
comparative discussion on various types 
is available from the Wikipedia (https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_
operating_systems).
There are several ways of 
classifying the OS. They had been 
traditionally described as batch, time 
sharing, distributed, network and real 
time OS depending on the type of the 
computers and the tasks they perform. 
Services performed by an operating 
system include: multitasking, internal 
memory sharing, handling input and 
output devices, reporting system status 
and error messages, scheduling to 
offload batch jobs and also parallel 
processing  when the programs run on 
more than one processors. The name of 
the OS may also reflect the size of the 
computer e.g. main frame, handheld 
mobiles, personal computers, mini 
and microcomputers etc.. The three 
major desk top computer operating 
systems are Windows, Mac Os and 
Linux; with the Windows taking about 
85% of the market share in August 2016, 
Mac taking little over 6% and Linux 
about 2%. The popularity of handheld 
systems that changed our lives are 
referred to as mobile operating systems 
(MOS) running in smart phones, 
tablets and other similar devices.  The 
familiar brand names are Android, 
iOS, Blackberry, Windows phone etc. 
The day-to-day life in the digital age 
abounds with examples of embedded 
systems present in the ATM’s, cars, 
PoS, digital cameras etc. Interest in 
web-based computing environments 
also had developed the field of cloud 
computation (https://en.wikipedia.org/
wiki/Cloud_(operating_system)). The 
Table 1 shows a summary of the usage 
of various operating systems in terms of 
global market share. 
There had also been discussions 
on alternate or future OS programs like 
business operating systems, AMOGAO, 
HAIKU, SKYOS, MORPHOS, DEXOS 
etc. that have not been commercially 
as competitive as the few main 
brand names (http://royal.pingdom.
co m / 2 0 0 8 / 0 9 / 2 6 / 1 0 - a m a z i n g ly-
alternative-operating-systems-and-
what-they-could-mean-for-the-future/)
Non-Us Operating Systems:
Currently Windows for PC is 
overwhelming the market for OS. 
However several countries with large 
domestic markets (e.g. India, Russia, 
China etc.) had followed the approach 
to replace Windows software, and even 
hardware, to indigenize the computer 
industry and information technology. 
A few of the relevant examples are 
described below. The summary is 
presented in Table 2.
Russian OS:
The Moscow Times (https://
themoscowtimes.com/articles/russian-
operating-system-to-launch-in-next-
decade-50052  accessed on Dec 16, 
2016) quoted Russian Government 
sources informing the decision of the 
government to replace the Windows 
based software and even computer 
hardware with domestic Russian 
products, the target remaining to 
substitute Windows software at all 
government agencies and strategic 
enterprises by the period 2025--2030. 
Currently the Windows enjoy virtual 
monopoly in the PC systems; and 
among the mobiles 35% Apple iOS and 
27% Android OS software are in use. 
The Russian plan also aims at building 
its own hardware by that time replacing 
Microsoft and Apple products and the 
associated application software.
Currently Astra-linux and Phantom 
OS are being developed as the Russian 
substitute. The former is Linux- like 
that intends to meet the needs of the 
Russian defense industries (www.astra-
linux.com). It’s developed by RusBitTech 
available in English and Russian. The 
latter, the Phantom, is developed by 
the Russian programmers. It’s object-
oriented and not Unix-like; it is available 
through Digital Zone (www.dz.ru/en).
Amidst the indigenization drive 
for the mobile platforms, Russian 
company Open Mobile Platform is hiring 
developers to use Android and iOS 
compatible applications to adapt to the 
non-US MOS platforms. The Sailfish OS 
had been an independent alternative. 
The open source software is developed 
by the Finish mobile company Jolla Ltd. 
and Sailfish OS community (https://
sailfishos.org).
Chinese, German and Indian OS:
China had also made efforts to 
develop non-US operating systems. Its 
product Kylin (later versions named 
neo-kylin and Ubuntu kylin) is Unix-like 
and available in about 60 languages 
(www.kylinos.com.cn). The product had 
been developed in the National Univ.  Of 
Defence Technology.
Germany had developed the RTOS 
embedded system for the German 
Aerospace Center for applications 
that require high dependability. It is 
named  Rodos Operating System (Real 
time On board Dependable Operating 
System) written in C, C++ and assembly 
languages. (www.Dlr.de/rodos)
India had reported, originally on 
Jan 10, 2007,   the Bharat Operating 
System Solutions (BOSS) as an 
alternative operating system developed 
by the National Resource Centre for 
Free Open Source Software (NRCFOSS/
CDAC, India). It is Linux-like and with 
multilingual ability to work with at least 
18 languages and is boasting to replace 
Windows in India (www.bosslinux.in)
Japanese OS:
The home grown computer 
operating system from Japan, TRON, 
(http://web-japan.org/trends/science/
sci030522.html) is credited to the 
work by Professor Ken Sakamura of 
the University of Tokyo in 1984, who 
had advocated the idea of “ubiquitous 
computing,” in which tiny semiconductor 
chips are invariably embedded in every 
product. TRON stands for ‘The Real-
Time Operating System Nucleus’.  The 
features like free open access to the 
COvER STORY

C S I  C o m m u n I C a t I o n S  |  F E B R u a R Y  2 0 1 7
source code and very high speed of 
data processing had made TRON an 
attractive choice in cellular phones and 
a large number of domestic electronic 
goods. The Japanese business 
organizations mean to utilize TRON 
or Linux in all devices connected to 
internet (info-appliances). It had been 
once estimated that about half of all the 
embedded chips run on TRON.
Mobile Operating Systems (MOS):
In the rest of this article that 
follows, the author emphasizes more 
details on the mobile technology 
operating systems that have become 
part of daily routine in the past decade 
revolutionizing the way common 
people think of action at a distance and 
globalization. This topic is also timely 
when the emphasis is being laid on the 
Digital India projects.
The mobile systems were primarily 
meant for use in the telephonic 
conversations. Then they eventually 
started competing in the internet 
technology claiming its share in 
e-commerce, e-banking and e-learning. 
The trend became deciding after 2010. 
The major mobile operating 
systems include:
(i)  Android based on Linux kernel, 
is free open source introduced by 
Google. It had been popular in the 
smart phones and also in some 
desktops, 
(ii)  iOS is proprietary software from the 
Apple Inc.  and is based on MacOS;
(iii)  Windows Phone is a Windows 
10 (and earlier versions) based 
platform and is closed source 
proprietary software; 
(iv)  Blackberry is a product of 
BlackBerry Limited (formerly 
Research in Motion Limited) and 
is a closed source proprietary 
product.  
Other MOS known to the consumers, 
but not so popular now, include Bada 
from Samsung Electronics, Symbian 
from Nokia, Palm OS from Access 
Company Ltd. etc.. In Q1 of 2016 the 
total sale for smart phones was more 
than 1 billion world over; and the global 
market share was 84.1% for Android, 
14.8% for iOS, 0.7% for Windows phone 
and 0.2% for Blackberry. 
The Wikipedia article lists the 
links that guide the reader to the major 
literature related to the mobile operating 
systems (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Mobile_operating_system)
Changes in Lifestyle and Emerging 
Trends: 
The competition for capturing the 
market for internet technology on the 
mobile systems had been well studied 
by many marketing research agencies 
(see Table 3.). Appearance of the World 
Wide Web really turned the globe into 
a village within the reach of common 
people from the privacy of one’s own 
home. Though the World Wide Web is 
only about a quarter of a century old, 
its growth and impact in human life is 
undeniable. According to a survey about 
half a billion new users got connected 
to the web in 2014 alone, bringing the 
total number of surfers to 3 billion 
world wide.  In a review in January 
2015 (http://www.mobileindustryreview.
com/2015/01/3-b i l l ion- internet-
users-2015.html; accessed Dec 20, 
2016) more than 80% of the population 
in Western Europe and the USA had 
access to the internet compared to 
about 19% in South Asian population. 
According to one survey people were 
spending on an average almost 4.5 
hours daily in 2015 in comparison with 
the 2 hours they used to spend about 10 
years ago in this world that typified the 
change on lifestyle adjusting to the age 
of information technology. The number 
of mobile broadband  (3G and 4G) in UK 
is 89% of population while the same 
figure for India is merely 8% in the year 
2015. These figures only speak of the 
potential for the market of broad band 
internet (mobile) technology when India 
adjusts to the modern lifestyle after 
digital penetration, especially in the 
business sector. Average world wide 
speed of the internet was 3.8 Mbps in 
2013, whereas it had enhanced to 4.5 
Mbps in 2015 world over. In UK 27% 
of the web pages served to mobile 
devices. Smart phones accounted for 
38% of mobile connections worldwide, 
and 40% of the world mobiles are 
broadband enabled. New research 
from leading analysts finds that over 
1 billion mobile phone users will have 
used their devices for banking purposes 
by the end of this year. This global user 
base is forecast to reach 2 billion by 
2020, by which time it will represent 
37% of the global adult population. 
(https://www.juniperresearch.com/
press/press-releases/mobile-banking-
users-to-exceed-1-bn-this-year). The 
mobile technology scenario in UK 
is comparable to the USA in relative 
terms, but India is falling behind China. 
In essence the expansion in India is 
likely to be faster beyond the year 2016.
The American lifestyle is taken as a 
typical pattern of the rich and advanced 
country that had adjusted to the mobile 
and internet technology over a short 
period of time, utilizing its existing 
infrastructure of the PC, the main frame 
computers and the e-mail presence. 
According to a survey conducted during 
2014, 90% of American adults own a 
cell phone; 42% of American adults own 
a tablet computer; 32% of American 
adults own an e-reader. The utilization 
of the mobile time pattern had been 
described as follows: 81% of the cell 
owners send and receive text, 60% 
access internet, 52% receive e-mail, 
50% download Apps as part of their 
daily use (http://www.pewinternet.org/
fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-
sheet/)).
Another survey cites that the 
number of smart phone users 
worldwide will surpass 2 billion in 2016, 
(world population 7.4 billion in Aug 2016) 
representing over a quarter of the global 
population and that number is expected 
to grow to more than 2.56 billion people, 
or a third of the world’s population, in 
2018. The vast amount of growth in the 
use of smart phones will come from 
China, the global leader in the market for 
smart phone users. India is to become 
the second largest, surpassing the USA, 
in registered users of smart phone. 
Alongside Russia is likely to surpass 
Japan to become the fourth largest 
smart phone user population. The 
projected number of smart phone users 
in the UK is 46 millions in 2018, and one 
should compare this number with the 
US population of about 325 millions in 
December 2016 and the UK population 
of about 65 millions in December 2016. 
In conclusion the three countries, China, 
India and Russia, are going to dominate 
in the market capitalization of smart 
phones by 2018 and beyond.  (http://

Conclusion: 
The general discussion had 
been on the hundreds of handsets 
available from commercial vendors 
and the salient features of their in-
built operating systems [for example 
see Wikipedia page] The private 
communication in the 21st century 
information technology had opened 
up myriads of opportunities in day-to-
day dealing of data including images 
and voice. The upcoming technology 
with its various applications software 
running on the handsets has changed 
the financial budgetary patterns in 
many families and offices. Emphasis on 
online and e-governance and availability 
of such services on mobile systems can 
appropriately be called m-commerce, 
m-government and m-learning. In 
addition to the routine use of mobile 
platform to every customer, the author’s 
group had used such opportunities for 
furthering knowledge and research 
as described earlier.  This particular 
article reviews the salient features of 
the software behind that charming 
looks of ‘consumable’ handsets rightly 
called the ‘mobile operating system’, 
and the changes in the ‘mobile’ lifestyle. 
In addition the article distinguishes the 
emerging markets for the computer 
and mobile technology outside the USA 
to point out the fact that the Indian 
economy is likely to become a global 
decision maker beyond 2018.
No instruction is required to 
introduce the reader to the computer 
and the world; such habits are included 
and inculcated in every one of us in 
our daily routine. The purpose of this 
article is to make ordinary public and 
the corporate executives aware of the 
various systems commercially available 
and their trends so that the reader can 
form a well-informed opinion. Moreover 
the vast literature cited through the 
website links would be an added benefit 
to the students and teachers alike for 
the classroom exercises.

Blockchain : A Disruptive Innovation
 KVN Rajesh  KVN Ramesh
 M.Tech in Computer Science and Technology from Andhra University  M.E in Structural Engg. from Andhra University
Demonetisation in India in 
November-2016 has been the greatest 
disrupter to Status quo in terms of 
economy and finance in the history of 
Post Independent India. Taking queue 
from India, Venezuela too announced 
on 11-Dec-2016 that its 100-bolivar big 
note would cease to be legal tender 
within 72 hours of the announcement. 
There has been great discourse 
and debate between Government, 
Opposition and common public in 
India about the merits and de-merits 
of cash economy and the advantages 
of move to a cashless digital economy. 
Black money, fake currency, terrorism, 
tackling money laundering and move 
to cashless digital economy have been 
projected by the Government as the 
reasons for Demonetisation. The Indian 
Government in no uncertain terms has 
conveyed its intention that cashless or 
less cash Digital economy is the way 
forward and has announced a number 
of incentives to promote cashless digital 
transactions. The literacy rate in India 
is around 75% and digital literacy rate 
would be definitely much lower than 
that. With lower digital literacy among 
the population, the increase in digital 
financial transactions is likely to lead 
to increase in number of cyber financial 
crimes. Even large financial institutions 
with powerful and secure technical 
infrastructure are not immune to the 
attacks by hackers and cyber criminals. 
When financial infrastructure is 
concentrated and centralized in the 
hands of few institutions, they are always 
prone to attack from both inside and 
outside of the respective organizations. 
In this context, a technology which 
is immune to tampering is bound to 
be successful and find widespread 
application. Blockchain is precisely 
that kind of technology. The Blockchain 
is a big buzzword now-a-days and is 
being promoted as the next big thing 
after the Internet. The Blockchain is 
usually heard in conjunction with the 
cryptocurrency named Bitcoin, since 
Blockchain is the technology behind 
Bitcoin. The author of this article, 
K.V.N.Rajesh, had also written an 
article titled “BITCOIN - An Overview 
of the Popular Digital Cryptocurrency” 
back in March 2014 in the same CSI 
Communications. He commented in the 
conclusion of that article that whether 
Bitcoin will succeed or not, only time 
can tell, but the concept behind Bitcoin 
is here to stay. That has come exactly 
true and Blockchain technology is 
finding application at every place where 
transactions between two or more 
parties are involved. The terms like 
Internet of Transactions, Internet of 
Value and Internet of Trust are being 
used in the context of Blockchain. The 
objective of this article is to explain 
the Blockchain technology and its 
various applications. Since Bitcoin and 
Blockchain are tightly intertwined, we 
are at many times referring to Bitcoin in 
this article to explain about Blockchain.
Origin of Blockchain
A Blockchain is a shared, 
distributed, immutable, public ledger 
of continuously growing and updated 
list of transactions. A group of validated 
transactions are aggregated into a 
block and each block contains data 
about the previous block thus creating 
a chain of blocks in chronological order. 
The origin of Blockchain and Bitcoin 
is linked together. It all started with a 
post titled “Bitocin P2P e-cash paper” 
by an anonymous developer named 
Satoshi Nakamoto on 01-Nov-2008 on 
a cryptography mailing list at http://
www.metzdowd.com/mailman/listinfo/
cryptography. The original post is still 
available at http://www.mail-archive.
com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/
msg09959.html. The post contained 
summary details of Bitcoin and a 
link (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) to 
the nine-page technical paper titled 
“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic 
Cash System” authored by Satoshi 
Nakamoto. The announcement of 
the first release of the Bitcoin (v0.1) 
happened on 09-Jan-2009 on the same 
cryptography mailing list. The post 
is still available at http://www.mail-
archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.
c o m / m s g 1 0 1 4 2 . h t m l .  S a t o s h i 
Nakamoto also made a post titled 
“Bitcoin open source implementation of 
P2P currency” at http://p2pfoundation.
ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-
source on 11-Feb-2009 about the 
release of Bitcoin v0.1 at http://www.
bitcoin.org. The first transaction on 
the Bitcoin Blockchain happened on 
12-Jan-2009 when Satoshi Nakamoto 
sent 10 bitcoins as a test to another 
computer cryptographic programmer 
named Hal Finney. The record of this 
first Blockchain transaction in the Block 
#170 of the Bitcoin Blockchain can be 
seen at https://blockchain.info/block-
index/15019.
At the time of its release, Bitcoin 
consisted of thirty-one thousand lines 
of code. The latest executable version 
of Bitcoin Core is available for download 
at https://bitcoin.org/en/download 
and it is available as a free software 
project released under MIT License. 
The Bitcoin source code is available at 
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin. It 
can be seen in the source code that the 
programming language predominantly 
used is C++.
Understanding the concept of 
Blockchain
The world financial crisis in the 
late 2000s and systematic banking 
collapses such as that of Lehman 
Brothers, seems to be the motivation 
behind Satoshi Nakamoto’s coming up 
with the Bitcoin. The value of money in 
the existing financial system is based 
on the trust created by a third party 
and intermediaries like Governments, 
Central Banks and Financial systems. 
Satoshi Nakamoto created a system 
where the trust is based on non-
human entity which is the code and 
cryptography designed in such a way 
that it is almost impossible to tamper 
and manipulate. The design itself is

such that it is more profitable to be 
honest and play by the rules rather than 
be dishonest and try to manipulate the 
system. Any effort to beat the system 
by the use of large scale computing 
power is bound to be detected by 
the other honest participants since 
Blockchain is not centralized and is a 
global distributed ledger. The attempt 
is bound to fail and hence would lead 
to a loss of investment in the dishonest 
efforts. The same efforts when spent 
to play by the rules of the system may 
lead to the incentives and rewards given 
the system. Thus the motivation would 
be to play by the rules and be honest. 
The subsequent part of this section 
describes how the Blockchain has been 
designed to establish trust.
Everybody must have heard of a 
ledger. Ledger is a book or software 
for record keeping of transactions of 
companies, organizations, banks and 
any other institution. Institutions use 
many kinds of ledgers like Sales Ledger, 
Purchase Ledger and General Ledger. 
Blockchain is a software 
implementation of a distributed and 
shared ledger based on cryptographic 
concepts. A highly simplified 
explanation of the Blockchain is as 
follows. A diagrammatic representation 
of Blockchain is available in Fig 1 and 
Fig 2. Whenever a transaction happens 
between two parties, the transaction 
is broadcast to the entire Blockchain 
network. At intervals of time, the group 
of transactions that happened after the 
creation of last block are validated. Once 
the validation is complete, a new block is 
generated. The average interval of time 
between creation of two blocks is 10 
minutes. The new block is timestamped 
and made immutable to tampering by 
cryptographic and hashing algorithms. 
The validation of the block is carried 
out by people known as miners. Each 
of the miner competes to complete 
the validation faster than the others. In 
case of Bitcoin Blockchain, the miner 
who completes the validation first 
and leads to the generation of a new 
block receives the rewards in terms of 
Bitcoin. Each of the blocks is connected 
to its previous block by storing the hash 
of the header of previous block. This 
connection of one block to another 
forms a virtual chain similar to a linked 
list and thus the name Blockchain. This 
Blockchain is distributed and stored on 
all nodes of the Blockchain network. 
The header of the Block also contains 
something called a Merkle Tree which is 
the summary of all the transactions in 
the block. The Merkle Tree also called 
a Binary Hash Tree, acts as a digital 
fingerprint of all the transactions in the 
block. Merkle Trees in Blockchain use a 
cryptographic algorithm named double-
SHA256. SHA256 is the secure hash 
algorithm designed by National Security 
Agency. SHA256 is a set of cryptographic 
hash functions whose key characteristic 
is that no two different inputs can 
produce the same hash output. Even 
a slightly different input will produce a 
vastly different hash output. To illustrate 
this point, an online SHA256 generator 
at http://www.timestampgenerator.
com/tools/sha256-generator/ is used.
The SHA256 hash output 
for the  string “I am Rajesh” is 
751d34e6ade738e0e60e063b3dfa1b76a 
83f90af4e123b2c3e903c19e9c58fdd
Let us change the string a little bit 
by adding a period at the end of the string 
as “I am Rajesh.”. The SHA256 output 
for the same is vastly different and is 
f55ac225cc2442877d0fa51163c142c471 
f870531edd802b60deb85752e4ce18 
Any attempt to hack the Blockchain 
would involve not just tampering 
the current block but the history of 
transactions in all the previous blocks. 
Also, since this distributed ledger is 
stored on all the nodes of network, the 
tampering needs to be done on all the 
nodes at the same time else there will 
be disagreement between the nodes 
and the tampering would get detected 
and the block would not be validated 
and included in the Blockchain. With the 
day by day growth of the Blockchain and 
the number of nodes in the network, the 
level of difficulty of tampering would 
keep on increasing exponentially. This 
extreme resistance to tampering of 
Blockchain by the virtue of its design 
and code is the characteristic which 
brings trust in the system. That is 
the reason why Blockchain is finding 
many applications in various systems 
wherever transactions between various 
parties are involved.
One of the main problems 
associated with cryptocurrencies is 
the problem of Double-Spending. In 
normal cash transaction, when you 
give a note or a coin to another person, 
there is no way that you can give the 
same note or coin to another person 
since cash is a physical entity and 
cannot have  multiple presence by the 
laws of physics as we know now. But 
Double-Spending is a real problem 
for the cryptocurrencies since there is 
no physical entity involved. If you are 
able to spend the same currency even 
after giving it to another person, the 
currency system is bound to collapse 
within short time. The success of the 
Blockchain technology is largely due to 
it having solved this Double-Spending 
problem. Every transaction added to 
the block chain is verified to ensure that 
the inputs to the transaction have not 
already been spent. In other systems, 
a trusted third party validates the rules 
and confirms each transaction, but the 
whole premise on which Bitcoin and 
Blockchain is based, is not having a third 
party. In Bitcoin, the need for various 
nodes of the Blockchain network to 
be in consensus prevents the Double-
Spending problem.

variants of Blockchain
The two variants of Blockchain are 
Public Chain and Private Blockchain. 
Public Blockchains are the Blockchains 
in which anyone in the world can 
read, transact and participate in the 
consensus process. Permissionless 
Blockchains is another term frequently 
used with regards to Public Blockchains 
since anybody can use it and anybody 
can become a miner in it without any 
permission from any authority. Bitcoin 
Blockchain is an example of Public 
Blockchain. Private Blockchains are 
TECHNICAL TRENDS

C S I  C o m m u n I C a t I o n S  |  F E B R u a R Y  2 0 1 7
the Blockchains where the users who 
can read, transact and participate are 
restricted. Private Blockchains are the 
Blockchains which are of more interest 
to the Businesses since they get all the 
advantages of the Blockchain while 
retaining a tight control on who does 
what in the system. There are again 
variants like Consortium Blockchains 
and Fully Private Blockchains here. 
Private Blockchains are also known 
as Permissioned Blockchains since 
users need permission to access the 
Blockchain. One example of the Private 
Blockchain is the distributed consensus 
ledger system by a company named 
Ripple for the banking and Financial 
industry. 
Hyperledger is another open 
source collaborative project to advance 
cross-industry Blockchain technologies 
for various industries like Finance, 
Banking, Internet of Things and Supply 
Chain. 
Advantages and Applications of 
Blockchain
More than the Bitcoin, it is the other 
possible applications of Blockchain that 
is causing such hype and excitement 
about this technology. Lesser costs and 
unprecedented speed of transactions 
due to absence of intermediaries is being 
seen as one of the main advantages of 
usage of Blockchain; Technology. Other 
advantages that are being seen are 
the ease of conducting transactions, 
security, efficiency, transparency, 
neutrality and traceability. 
Any common man who has dealt in 
real estate or is buying land or plot knows 
how hard it is to trust about whether he 
is buying from the correct legal owner 
of the property and if the property has 
not already been sold to somebody else. 
Blockchain technology will bring great 
transparency when applied to Land 
Registry Systems. Sweden is conducting 
tests to implement Blockchain in 
its Land Registry and real estate 
transactions. Central American country 
named Honduras is taking help of a U.S. 
Blockchain technology company named 
Factom to apply Blockchain technology 
in building a permanent and secure 
land title record system. 
Smart and self-executing contracts 
are another area where Businesses 
are evincing great interest to apply 
and use Blockchain technology. Smart 
contracts are contracts where the 
contractual terms are written in special 
computer programming languages. 
In the current scenario, the contract 
funds are deposited with a third party 
escrow account. The third party does 
verification and then releases funds 
to the concerned party on completion 
of contractual agreements. The third 
party charges certain percentage of 
the contractual amount for its services. 
The Smart Contracts with Blockchain 
as the underlying technology can 
discard the Intermediary. The funds 
could be deposited to a virtual account 
and the Smart Contract Code can 
automatically release the funds to the 
concerned party on fulfillment of the 
contractual agreements listed in the 
computer language code. This would 
be more transparent and can save the 
money spent on the third party services. 
The decentralized platform named 
Ethereum developed by Ethereum 
Foundation is one of the solutions which 
runs smart contracts.
It is not uncommon to see the 
political parties raising the issue of 
vote tampering after elections. The 
application of Blockchain in voting 
in democracies is being visualized 
to prevent the possibility of vote 
tampering. This is to prevent rigging and 
to secure the votes by recording them 
in Blockchain database which is highly 
immune to tampering. In December 
2016, a Block chain voting project 
named Votebook by three New York 
University Students won the $10,000 
prize in a challenge from Kaspersky 
Lab.
Blockchain – Indian Perspective
Being at the forefront of Information 
technology industry, India and Indians 
are not the ones to be left behind on 
something as path-breaking and as 
disruptive as Blockchain. India’s top 
Business group Mahindra is partnering 
with IBM on applying Blockchain in the 
supply chain finance business. They are 
also working on integrating Blockchain 
and Internet of Things solutions for 
tracking truck movements and delivery 
times of goods. 
In June 2016, Reserve Bank 
of India expressed its intention to 
setup a committee to study usage of 
Blockchain to reduce use of Paper 
currency. The Sunrise State of Andhra 
Pradesh has introduced the Blockchain 
technologies to prevent cybercrimes. 
It introduced Blockchain in some of its 
departments to prevent its databases 
from being hacked. Andhra Pradesh 
is also planning to setup a Blockchain 
Technology Institute in the port city of

Visakhapatnam in collaboration with 
University of California, Berkeley.  
In October-2016, ICICI bank 
announced that it carried out India’s 
first Blockchain transactions for 
fund remittance between its Mumbai 
branch and Dubai branch of Emirates 
NBD Bank. ICICI bank also carried 
out a Blockchain network based pilot 
transaction involving a Mumbai firm 
and a supplier from Dubai for import 
of steel scrap. Two other Indian Banks 
named Kotak Mahindra and Axis Bank 
are conducting pilot transactions using 
Blockchain and are experimenting it in 
various Business segments. 
Kratos Innovation Labs, a Singapore 
based startup founded by two Indians 
named Satheesh Kumar Paddolker 
and Rajiv Kaushik, has developed two 
blockchain products named x-DeFraud 
and Smart Contracts as a Service 
(SCaaS). These products are related 
to detecting fraud in trade finance and 
customized Smart Contract solutions 
for financial institutions.
An Infosys subsidiary named 
EdgeVerve has released a Blockchain 
Framework for Financial Services, 
which is a shared distributed ledger 
solution for payments, trade finance, 
smart contracts and other transactions. 
TCS is also investing in Blockchain 
technology and is getting ready to 
launch a core banking software based 
on Blockchain. Cognizant entered into 
an agreement with Japan based Mizuho 
Financial Group to develop Blockchain 
solutions for its customers and group 
companies.
Learning Resources for Blockchain
As already mentioned, Bitcoin was 
the first purpose for which Blockchain 
technology was developed by Satoshi 
Nakamoto, so learning about Blockchain 
invariably involves understanding the 
implementation of Bitcoin Blockchain. 
To learn about Blockchain straight 
from the horse’s mouth, we can refer 
to Blockchain section of the bitcoin 
developer guide at https://bitcoin.org/
en/developer-guide#block-chain. This 
website https://bitcoin.org was originally 
registered by Satoshi Nakamoto and 
another developer named Martti 
Malmi. A host of other documentation 
is available at https://bitcoin.org/en/
developer-documentation.
The Bitcoin wiki at https://
en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Main_Page is another 
one-stop shop for all things related 
to Bitcoin and Blockchain. The main 
interest now in Blockchain is due 
to the various purposes other than 
Bitcoin for which it can be applied to.

Conclusion
In these times when the Government 
has declared war on corruption and 
people are demanding increasingly 
fast, efficient and transparent services 
from the Government and Businesses, 
the Block chain technology is bound 
to come into picture sooner than later. 
Blockchain based identity management 
and financial solutions can be used to 
accelerate the move towards cashless 
economy which the Government is 
aiming for. Blockchain technology 
can reduce the cost of cross-border 
remittances which is fueling the 
economies of many developing 
countries. More and more applications of 
Blockchain to various systems involving 
transactions are bound to be developed 
and implemented across the world. 
This is definitely going to have positive 
impact on the Global Economy and also 
going to provide a lot of opportunities to 
people and organizations skilled in the 
Blockchain technologies.

Customized Linux Distributions for 
Bioinformatics Applications

Introduction
The creation of this beautiful 
universe is the witness of the 
systemization of everything. To better 
understand this concept, we can have 
a look at our ‘Genome’. The genome is 
said to be the “Blueprint” of an organism 
since it is composed of the whole set 
of genes and gene products. It is the 
genome which is known to control and 
regulate the framework of an individual. 
Complex systems are defined as large 
numbers of interactions among various 
constituents. The genome is the janitor 
of the living organisms managing 
everything; very similarly, we have the 
operating system which is the most 
essential part of any computer system 
(Yan et al., 2010). The main purpose of an 
operating system is to provide a milieu 
where the user can interact and execute 
the programs in a very easy yet efficient 
manner. Due to rapid advancement and 
applications of computational biology 
and bioinformatics in biomedical and 
pharmaceutical industries, there 
has been a need for the creation 
of operating system which suites 
the requirements of computational 
biologists and medical scientists. This 
article focuses on operating system 
customized for computational biology 
and bioinformatics applications.
Advent of open source operating 
systems and Linux distributions
With the advent of free and open 
source software (FOSS), this movement 
has overtaken operating systems 
causing many of them to be made 
available. Since the source code is 
available freely under FOSS movement, 
the detailed study of operating systems 
became quite easy. Some of the 
examples of open source operating 
systems are Linux (1991), FreeBSD 
(1993), Ubuntu (2011), etc. The initial 
effort for the movement was started by 
Richard Stallman in 1983 under GNU 
Project and later in 1985 GNU Manifesto 
was published to outline the purpose 
and importance of free and open source 
software. The biggest breakthrough of 
open source operating system began 
with the development and release 
of Linux by a Finnish student Linux 
Torvalds in 1991; who developed a free 
kernel of the operating system and 
released it under GNU General Public 
Licence. Since then, there have been a 
large number of Linux distribution, a list 
of top 10 distributions is shown in Fig. 1.

Customized Linux for Bioinformatics & 
Computational Biology Applications
The advent of open source 
operating systems leads to the 
development of customized operating 
systems for various purposes 
including computational biology and 
bioinformatics applications (Årdal et 
al., 2011). Pharmaceuticals are an 
often mentioned application area for 
customized operating system for drug 
discovery. Open source utilization in 
the field of pharmaceuticals paving, or 
rather has already paved a way for the 
development of this prominent field 
known as Chemoinformatics. The WHO’s 
Consultative Expert Working Group for 
Research and Development Financing 
and Coordination has evaluated open 
source drug discovery (Årdal et al., 
2011). Pharmaceutical companies have 
contributed a lot to the discovery of 
drugs for many diseases. Few research 
based pharmaceutical industries have 
also made commendable efforts to 
discovery drugs for T.B. Some of the 
customized Linux for bioinformatics 
and computational biology applications 
are described as follows and depicted 
in Fig. 2. 
Fig. 2 : Five popular customized Linux 
tailored for bioinformatics applications
BioLinux: It is a free bioinformatics 
platform built on Ubuntu Linux LTS 
based, providing more than 250 
bioinformatics packages, 50 graphical 
applications, and hundreds of command 
line utilities. The recent Bio-Linux 
version 8.0 also incorporates Galaxy 
environment for browser-based data 
analysis. The Bio-Linux is created and 
maintained by NERC Environmental 
Bioinformatics Centre (NEBC). It is not 
only available for workstation but also 
on cloud architecture such as Amazon 
EC2 by using CloudBioLinux. It can also 
run directly from a DVD/USB without 
installing analysis (Field et al., 2006). 
BioSLAX: It is also a customized 
operating system for bioinformatics 
build on SLACKWARE flavour of the

Linux, comprises of more than 300 
bioinformatics tools. It directly runs 
from the DVD/USB without the need of 
installation, and let the user modularize 
applications and plug it into the system 
on the fly. It was first released by Life 
Sciences Institute (LSI), National 
University of Singapore in 2006. 
DNALinux: It is also a virtual 
machine based on SLAX having lots 
of bioinformatics tools including 
AutodockSuite, Biopython, BLAST, 
ClustalX, EMBOSS, NCBI Toolkit, and 
so on. Since its first release in 2007, 
there is subsequence releases (Bassi & 
Gonzalez, 2007). 
OSDDLinux: The main objective of 
Open Source Drug Discovery (OSSD) 
Linux is to create a novel open source 
computational and experimental 
platform for drug discovery. It allows 
universities, researchers, students, 
organizations and pharmaceutical 
industries world-wide on scientific 
projects to contribute for drug design 
and discovery. The OSDDLinux operating 
systems capability is not just restricted 
to drug designing, but encompasses 
various fields of bioinformatics analysis 
and computational biology as well. 
LXtoo: It is another customized 
Linux distribution for bioinformatics 
research community, where “LX” stands 
for LiangXian and “too” indicates that it 
is based on Gentoo. It is distributed as 
LiveCD/LiveUSB and run within VMware 
too for parallel execution with host 
operating system (Yu et al., 2012). 
Summary
The field of Bioinformatics has 
made commendable contributions in 
understanding the modern biology. 
Bioinformatics software and tools 
packaged with Linux Operating system 
to offer a better and cheaper way to 
set up an influential workbench for 
computational biologists. Today, Linux 
operating system comes with attractive 
desktop environments, which are easier 
to use without much training. Also, 
Linux is virtually resistant to Trojans and 
viruses, it is definitely a better choice 
for any life science researcher willing 
to perform biological computations. 
Today’s research is open to computer 
technology irrespective of the fact of 
what scientific background it belongs to. 
Bioinformatics tools are available freely 
for all scientific backgrounds. Many 
operating systems mentioned above

Cyber Threat Analysis with  
Memory Forensics
 Hardik Gohel  Himanshu Upadhyay
 Working in Cyber Security Research  Project Management Professional
Introduction
In today’s world, the dependency 
on computers is growing extensively. 
Government agencies and private 
companies are attempting to protect 
themselves from cyberattacks with 
digital defense techniques like 
encryption, firewalls and heuristic or 
signature scanning, etc. Meanwhile, 
the number of attacks that include 
infiltrating military data centers, 
targeting power grids and stealing trade 
secrets from both private and public 
organizations continues to increase. 
The detection, response and reporting 
of these kinds of intrusions as well 
as other incidents involving computer 
systems, are crucial for cyber security 
professionals.
As these attacks continue to 
expand and the sophistication of the 
adversaries grow, defenders must adapt 
in order to survive. If proof-of-damage 
is never written to secondary storage, 
there is no way to rely on disk forensics. 
On the other hand, memory has a high 
potential to carry malicious code from 
an infection, partially or completely, 
even though it’s never written to 
secondary storage (e.g., a hard drive). 
This is because the malicious code is 
loaded into the memory to execute. 
The random access memory of the 
victimized system also contains the 
proof of the system resources allocated 
by malicious code.
Just like that, if the data taken from 
the organizationis encrypted across the 
network,to determine which sensitive 
files were stolen and that won’t be 
recognized by traditional packet capture 
techniques. However, passwords and 
encrypted keys can often be recovered 
by memory forensics, or even the file’s 
plain-text contents before they were 
encrypted, providing information to 
understand the scope of an attack.

Memory Forensics
In the world of digital forensics, 
memory forensics is arguably the most 
interesting and fruitful realm. Memory 
forensics involves analyzing the data 
stored in the physical memory at 
operating system runtime. Its primary 
application is in the investigation of 
advanced computer attacks which 
are stealthy enough to avoid leaving 
data on the computer hard drive. 
Consequently, the memory (RAM) must 
be analyzed for forensic information. 
Each and every function performed 
by an application or operating system 
results in a special kind of change to 
the random access memory. These 
changes often stay for a long time after 
completion of the operation, crucially 
storing them. Furthermore, memory 
forensics provides unprecedented 
visibility into the runtime state of the 
system, such as which processes were 
running, open network connections, 
and recently executed commands. 
Individuals can perform an extraction 
of these artifacts that is totally 
independent of the machine being 
investigated. It also reduces the chance 
of rootkits or malware preventing the 
investigation process. Crucial data 
may exist exclusively in memory, such 
as unencrypted e-mail messages, 
disk encryption keys, non-cacheable 
internet history records, off-the-record 
chat messages and memory-resident 
injected code fragments.

Fig. 2 : Process of Memory Forensics
Memory forensics is about 
capturing the profile as well as 
the memory contents and can add 
an invaluable resource to incident 
response, malware analysis, and digital 
forensics capabilities. Even though 
inspection of network packet captures 
and hard disks can yield compelling 
verification, it is often the contents of 
the computer memory that enables 
the full reconstruction of events, 
allowing an individual to determine 
what has already happened, what is 
presently happening,and what would 
happen with further infection through 
malware or an intrusion by advanced 
threat actors. For example, a piece of 
evidence found in RAM could help to 
associate typical forensic artifacts that 
may appear different and allow for 
an integration which could otherwise 
remain unnoticed.
There are three reasons for 
gathering and analyzing the data 
contained in the physical memory. First, 
the physical memory contains real-time 
data related to the operating system 
environment, such as the currently-
mounted file system and the list of 
processes being operated. Second, 
even the encrypted data is generally 
decrypted when it is stored in the 
physical memory. Third, this method 
adapts well to the characteristics of 
embedded systems. Since an embedded 
system is rarely turned off, the data 
contained in the physical memory is 
mostly persistent. Therefore, significant 
information can be obtained if analysis 
is performed effectively on the physical 
memory.
The different types of information 
that can be extracted from memory 
include processes, dynamic link 
libraries (dll), process memory, image 
identification, kernel memory and 
objects, networking, registry, malware 
and rootkits.

system traverses random access 
memory, including processes and 
threads, rootkits and malware, IP 
addresses, network sockets, URLs, 
open files, passwords, catches, 
clipboards and other user generated 
content, encrypted keys, configurations 
of hardware and software and windows 
registry keys and event logs. 
The types of artifacts found in 
memory dumps share a common origin. 
They all starts out as an allocation. 
Why, when and how the regions of 
memory were allocated sets them 
apart, in addition to the actual data 
stored within and around them. As a 
part of memory forensics, the study 
of these behaviors could be helpful to 
make inferences about the allocation 
of the content, leading to the ability 
to find and label specific types of data 
throughout a large memory dump. 
Additionally, the knowledge of allocation 
and de-allocation of memory and their 
algorithms (i.e., First Fit, Best Fit, Next 
Fit and Buddy System) could aid in 
understanding the context of the data. 
For example, which block of memory is 
free or which one is allocated.

Forensics
Windows Forensics
Memory forensics for Windows 
involves finding and analyzing executive 
objects. Windows is written in C and 
the data as well as the attributes 
organization heavily use C structures. 
Out of those, several of structures 
are called executive objects. They are 
created, deleted and protected by the 
object manager of Windows. The object 
manager is a component of the kernel 
implemented by the NT module.
The major executive objects of 
Windows for memory forensics include 
file, process, symbolic link, token, 
window station, thread, desktop, mutant, 
types and keys. These executive objects 
are available with the corresponding 
name of the structure(e.g., file with 
_FILE_OBJECT structure). There is at 
least one Volatility plugin that analyzes 
each of the executive objects listed 
above.
Linux Forensics
In Linux memory forensics, the 
fundamental approach is to begin 
analyzing memory dumps of Linux. 
Specifically, one must be aware of 
traditional and modern memory 
acquisition techniques on Linux with 
their benefits and drawbacks. To 
perform Linux memory forensics, it 
is required to create Linux profiles, 
which are archives and contain useful 
information that Volatility needs to 
adequately find and intercept the data in 
memory dumps of Linux. Furthermore, 
one should be aware of the challenges 
to deploy Linux memory forensics in an 
enterprise environment, where critical 
servers may not even have compilers 
in C with other libraries which are 
found on workstations and desktops of 
standard Linux.
Mobile OS Memory Forensics
Various mobile operating system 
are currently in use,including Android, 
iOS, Windows 10 mobile, Tizen, Sailfish 
and Ubuntu touch. The most popular 
mobile OSs are Android and iOS. The 
rapid increase of systems running 
Android and Mac OS in both home and 
corporate environments has resulted in 
Android and Mac systems being a focus 
of targeted attacks. Because of these 
factors, cybersecurity experts have 
worked to develop tools for Android and 
iOS for robust investigative capabilities 
for Linux and Windows systems. To 
perform Android and Mac OS memory 
forensics, one has to create a Volatility 
profile for Android and Mac systems and 
can use one of the tools for acquisition 
of memory. Furthermore, some of the 
unique facets such as 64 bit addressing 
on 32 bit kernels, the typical userland 
and lay out of kernel address space, and 
the use of microkernel components are 
also major considerations. 
Tools of Memory Forensics
While there are multiple types 
of tools available to perform memory 
forensics, the Volatility framework and 
Linux Memory Extractor (LiME) are the 
most popular. 
LiME is one of the best memory 
dump tools. It is a Linux kernel module 
(LKM) released by ShmooCon, which 
performs memory dumps for the 
Linux system. It is the first tool that 
can perform entire memory dumps 
from Linux-based devices and from 
Android. LiME is a powerful device that 
can perform memory dumps by loading 
modules immediately after compiling 
without any other operations, such as a 
change in kernel settings. Particularly 
in the case of Android, one can dump a 
file directly into external memory after 
inputting a pre-compiled module file 
into the external memory and loading 
the module through the command line. 
LiME features provide full memory 
acquisition and acquisition over the 
network interface with a minimal 
process footprint.
The second popular memory 
forensic tool is the Volatility framework. 
It is a single, cohesive framework that 
analyzes RAM dumps from Linux, 32- 
and 64-bit windows, Mac, and Android 
systems. The modular design of Volatility 
allows it to easily support new operating 
systems and architectures as they are 
released. So, all devices are targets. It 
doesn’t limit the forensic capabilities to 
just Windows computers. Furthermore, 
it is an open source written in Python 
and has extensible and scriptable API 
with unparalleled feature sets and 
comprehensive coverage of file formats.
Benefits of Memory Forensics
The benefits of memory forensics 
include, but are not limited to:
  Memory forensics is an ideal 
analysis that includes physical 
memory data (from RAM) as well 
as Page File (or SWAP space) data
  Analysis of memory is the best 
place to identify malicious software 
activity 
  Memory forensics helps to analyze 
and track recent activities of the 
system in context with the user’s 
profile and activities of attackers.

  Malicious code is not yet conducting 
anti-forensics within random 
access memory.
  Memory forensics is the only way 
to collect evidence that cannotbe 
found anywhere else, such as 
chat threats, Internet activities, 
memory-only malware, etc.
  Every bit of data being created, 
viewed, or destroyed goes through 
RAM. This includes all web-
browsing activity, document edits, 
images, sending and receiving 
of network data, execution of 
applications, and essentially 
anything that appears on the 
monitor.
  RAM is effectively a “disk,” hence 
it is necessaryto preserve and 
investigate the memory in addition 
to the hard disk.
Challenges in Memory Forensics
There are many challenges to 
performing memory forensics, including 
the following. 
  Evaluating the diverse memory 
acquisition tools available, which 
perform differently depending 
on the operating system version, 
installed hardware and the 
configurations.
  If the termination character cannot 
be found. Consider the situation 
in which, analyzing the physical 
address space of a system that 
leverages paged virtual memory, a 
string is encountered that crosses 
a page boundary to a page that is 
no longer memory resident, which 
would require special processing 
or heuristics to determine the 
actual size of the string.
  The challenges faced during linked 
list analysis also apply with the 
analysis of memory trees.
  Memory evidence is often found 
on non-volatile media and comes 
in various shapes and sizes. As a 
cyber security expert, one must be 
aware of the different formats and 
the procedure of converting one 
format into another.
  When the system is powered off, 
the whole disk, individual partition, 
or virtual file-based containers 
are encrypted. This protection 
results in serious challenges for 
investigators, even if they gain 
access to the media
Research Directions & Conclusion
The major thrust area of operating 
system memory forensic is to perform 
Linux memory forensics. Government 
offices and business organizations are 
major Linux adopters. There are many 
security issues with the Linux operating 
system. The research direction should 
focus on applied operations of memory 
forensics in Linux machines and 
advanced data analysis using machine 
learning which will be very useful 
to the Linux cyber society. This will 
allow government agencies, business 
organizations and also small-scale 
industries to secure their system 
operations. Antiviruses, which are one 
of the alternatives, can prevent malware 
from entering the system; however, 
what if an antivirus becomes disabled by 
admin access through the rootkit? So, 
there is a need of research to provide 
models and algorithms to increase 
the security of the operating system 
resulting in the cyber protection of the 
users. Research focused on memory 
forensics using machine learning 
could be one of the key factor as it is 
rarely addressed by anti-virus products 
available in the market. In the cyber 
community, such research may provide 
the solution for many of the challenges.

Top Ten Alternative Operating Systems  
You Should Try Out
 Deepu Benson
 Amal Jyothi College of Engineering
There are hundreds of operating 
systems available in the market but 
sadly our quest for operating systems 
mostly end with Windows, Linux, 
macOS or a mobile operating system 
like Android.  I am sure 99 percentage 
of the people who read this article 
have only used one or more of these 
operating systems. If you are rich 
enough to pay a substantial amount 
for an operating system you mightbe 
having some version of Windows from 
Microsoft or macOS from Apple with 
you, if you are geek enough to work with 
Linux then some distribution of Linux 
like Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Debian etc. 
might be with you or if you have a smart 
phone then a mobile operating system 
like Android OS, iPhone OS, etc., might 
be familiar to you. And by now you might 
be wondering what else is remaining 
to try out other than these popular 
operating systems. In this article, I am 
discussing about ten operating systems 
you may not have used nevertheless 
very important. The final list is prepared 
after going through a lot of desktop, 
mobile operating systems and single 
board computer operating systems. 
Since the ultimate aim of this article is 
to persuade the readers to try out some 
of these operating systems I haven’t 
considered server operating systems 
like macOS Server or super computer 
operating systemslike CNK Operating 
System requiring costly hardware.  
UNIX
The very first operating system 
we have to try out is UNIX. Before 
discussing any further about UNIX I want 
to clarify one popular misconception. 
UNIX is not Linux. Linux distributions 
can be called Unix-like but there are 
many differences between UNIX and 
Linux. Linux is an open source software 
meaning you can freely get a copy, view 
the source code, and modify Linux the 
way you like. Unlike Linux, UNIX is not 
an open source software and is owned 
by a consortium called The Open Group. 
Only those operating systems licensed 
by The Open Group can be trade marked 
as UNIX. AIX from IBM, HP-UX from 
Hewlett Packard, Solaris from Sun 
Micro Systems etc. are examples for 
pure UNIX operating systems. 
Raspbian
Raspbian is a Debian Linux based 
operating system. If so why Raspbian 
operating system is included in this 
list? The first reason is that Raspbian 
is an operating system for Raspberry 
Pi, a single board computer provided 
by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. This 
single board computer is heavily 
used in Internet of Things (IoT) based 
applications. So, in the near future 
you definitely will come across a lot 
of systems working with Raspbian 
operating system. Raspberry Pi has an 
ARM processor which uses Reduced 
Instruction Set Computing (RISC) 
architecture. So, the instruction set 
implemented by Raspbian is RISC 
rather than CISC (Complex Instruction 
Set Computing),the instruction set 
implemented by operating systems like 
Windows, macOS etc. Thus, Raspbian 
being a RISC based operating system 
is the second reason for its inclusion 
in this list. Raspbian is an open source 
software freely available for installation. 
eComStation
eComStation is an operating 
system based on the OS/2 operating 
system. OS/2 is a very popular operating 
system developed and maintained by 
IBM. When IBM made the decision 
not to develop OS/2 any further the 
user community of OS/2 interfered 
with the development of OS/2. A 
community of users started developing 
this operating system with the brand 
name eComStation. eComStation is 
very important because it is the last 
functioning operating system belonging 
to the OS/2 family of operating systems. 
eComStation is a proprietary operating 
system with open source components.   
Chrome OS
Chrome OS is derived from the 
Linux Kernel developed by Google. The 
importance of Chrome OS lies in the 
fact that the principle user interface of 
the operating system is the Chrome web 
browser. So, in simple terms Chrome 
OS is a browser based operating system 
distinct from all the other operating 
systems included in this list. Chrome 
OS primarily supports web applications. 
Unlike the other web browser based 
operating system Firefox OS, Chrome 
OS is still operational and continually 
produces newer versions with the latest 
version released in 15th of December 
2016. Chrome OS itself is not an open 
source software but it has an open 
source equivalent called Chromium OS. 
ReactOS
We have heard the term Unix-like 
a number of times in this article, now 
it is time for us to discuss the term 
Windows-like. ReactOS is an open 
source software freely available for 
installation which imitates Microsoft 
Windows, just like Linux imitating UNIX. 
ReactOS is binary-compatible with 
computer programs and device drivers 
made for Windows. In simple terms, 
an executable file say program.exe 
produced for Windows can be executed 
in ReactOS. Remember the fact that you 
cannot execute a Windows executable 
file in Linux. The development started 
as the Windows 95 clone project and 
the latest clone available is for Windows 
2003 Server. Yes, currently ReactOS 
is far behind in development with 
Microsoft Windows 10 in the markets. 
But let us hope one day ReactOS will 
catch up with Windows.  
Tizen
Tizen is an operating system based 
on the Linux kernel and the Gnu C 
Library implementing the Linux API. 
If Tizen is yet another free and open 
source Linux clone what is so important 
about it? Well, Tizen is not a desktop 
operating system like most other 
operating systems included in this list. 
It is an operating system that works on a 
wide range of devices like smartphones, 
tablets, smart TVs, smart Cameras etc.

Tizen operating system is developed 
by the Tizen Association comprising 
of companies like Fujitsu, Huawei, 
Panasonic, Samsung, Vodafone etc. 
JNode
JNode is a simple operating system 
just like countless other operating 
systems available in the market. What 
makes it so special? Well, operating 
system development is a world 
dominated by C programming language 
and Assembly languages. But here is an 
operating system developed using Java. 
Yes, fully developed using Java. JNode 
is a simple to use and easy to install 
Java operating system for personal 
computers. JNode is an open source 
software freely available for installation. 
KolibriOS
Have you ever tried to download 
an operating system from the Internet? 
You might have waited for a long time to 
download the whole operating system. 
A typical operating system will have 
size in the range of a few Giga Bytes.
But here we have an operating system 
called KolibriOS of size around 1.44 MB. 
Yes, the whole operating system can 
be stored inside a floppy disc, if floppy 
discs were still available. KolibriOS has 
a Graphical User Interface (GUI) also. 
So, it’s safe to assume that KolibriOS 
is the smallest GUI operating system 
available in the world unless someone 
somewhere came up with an even 
smaller operating system, the chances 
of which looks very slim. KolibriOS is 
written entirely in Assembly language 
and this feature makes it extremely fast. 
Moreover, KolibriOS is an open source 
software freely available for installation. 
AmigaOS
Of all the operating systems 
discussed in this article AmigaOS is 
the one with the least probability of 
being used by a reader. There are many 
reasons for making such an assumption. 
AmigaOS being a proprietary software 
itself is a very good reason for many 
people to overlook it. The support and 
development of AmigaOS is about to 
finish in the near future and that is 
another reason for its relative obscurity. 
If so why is it included in this list? It is 
the native operating system of the Amiga 
and AmigaOne personal computers. 
And what is so special about these 
computers? Well, these computers 
support the PowerPC architecture 
and that makes AmigaOS one of the 
last surviving operating system that 
supports PowerPC architecture. 
visopsys
Finally, it is time to discuss 
Visopsys or Visual Operating System. It 
is a simple and fast operating system. 
But we have already seen KolibriOS one 
of the fastest available in the market. 
So, what makes Visopsys so special? 
When compared with most of the 
modern standard operating systems 
Visopsys don’t have many necessary 
features. But what makes Visopsys 
unique is the fact that it is developed 
by a single person. Yes, a hobbyist 
operating system developer called 
Andy McLaughlin developed the whole 
operating system all by himself. The 
development started in 1997 and though 
the operating system is functional by 
now even supported with a GUI Andy 
McLaughlin is still continuing with the 
development of Visopsys by adding 
more and more features. Frankly, it 
took me some time to believe that a 
single person can develop an operating 
system. It is like a single person building 
the whole of Taj Mahal all by himself. 
Yet, Andy McLaughlin did it and more 
over he was gracious enough to make 
Visopsys an open source software so 
that future generations will benefit from 
it.  
Now it is time to wind up this article. 
But before we part ways I request you 
to take the extra effort to download and 
use one of these operating systems 
mentioned in this article. I am sure 
the effort taken will not go in vain. By 
working with an operating system not 
related to Windows, Linux, or macOS 
your knowledge of computer science 
will grow exponentially and who knows 
who all are going to get benefitted by it.

Operating Systems
 Simran
Chandigarh Group of Colleges, Landran, Mohali
An Operating system is the heart of computer. From IBM’s IBM System/360 Operating System to 
Microsoft’s Windows 10 to Linux’s Fedora, there are lots of changes emerging in all the generations’ 
Operating Systems. There is always need of upgrading operating system from time to time so as to 
meet user requirements and trends growing in the technology. Using an Operating system, it is easy to 
use hardware resources, gaming, business applications, application programs and other development 
IDEs. Whether it is open-source or closed-source operating system, all have their own features and 
pros as well as some cons. It is necessary to use an operating system in an efficient and convenient 
way for proper utilization of computing resources and hardware. With latest technology trends, there 
is need to add some features like customizability, cloud services on one platform, ease of installation, 
cost-effective, security, reliable anti-viruses, 24*7 technical support for customers etc.
Introduction
An Operating system is an interface 
between the computer user, applications 
and computer hardware. An operating 
system provides the necessary platform 
to users for using different application 
programs, executable programs, 
system software and utilizing computer 
hardware efficiently. Operating systems 
change the way to use application 
softwares, networking, file sharing, user 
control, authorization and many more. 
An operating system in a computer 
manages all the softwares installed, 
applications, processes, memory and 
hardware. 
The most widely used operating 
systems are Microsoft Windows, Linux, 
Mac OS X and iOS, Android. As Windows, 
Linux and Mac OS X are desktop based 
operating systems, while iOS and 
android are smartphone operating 
systems. For desktop application 
more than 85% users use Windows as 
major operating system for running 
their applications, games etc. After 
windows, iOS and Mac OS X have large 
market share among all these. The 
open-source operating system, Linux 
is now widely being used by developers, 
programmers and individuals.
Each operating system come 
with their pros and cons. The widely 
and most spread operating systems 
like Windows, MacOS X and Linux 
are quite comparable to each other. 
The features that separate Windows 
from other operating systems include 
compatibility for every software-all 
kinds of applications, games, drivers, 
IDEs can run on Windows, One product 
for all, technical support for its users, 
various networking functions,  better 
GUI interface, file sharing, flexibility 
to use, more available software 
products, anti-viruses etc. Apart from 
all these huge number of advantages, 
it has some cons also. For example 
more hardware requirements due 
to installation of anti-viruses and 
malware, Lacking security system, 
expensive, less portability- cannot be 
used from one platform to another. 
Windows is a closed-source operating 
system, which means one cannot 
modify or add any tools or features to 
the operating system by their own. 
Windows based operating systems are 
less secure than open-source operating 
systems due to the reason that later 
ones do not have default administrator 
access or root access, whereas 
Windows provide Administration access 
to all the applications and programs 
downloaded. That’s why, windows is 
more unsafe or vulnerable to viruses, 
worms etc. Security features are also 
lacking somewhere. Windows is more 
vulnerable to cyber attacks, hacking 
also. Therefore, anti-viruses need to 
be installed and update from time to 
time. On the same point, installing 
antiviruses or malware takes computer 
memory, disk space, CPU. Windows is 
designed for general hardware such 
that you can purchase it for either 
32-bit processor or 64-bit processor. 
Also, one demerit is that windows is 
totally non-customizable. Almost every 
program designed, can be installed 
and run on windows. It does not use 
any ‘live’ boot system unlike Linux. 
You have to purchase the licensed 
product and install it with only technical 
knowledge for installation. Coming on 
Cost-windows is quite expensive than 
Linux. For large deployments, business 
uses, industry work and for desktop 
computing, Microsoft windows is best 
one to be chosen. 
The different versions of Windows 
that are use, are- Windows 9x family, 
Windows 2000 family, Windows XP, 
Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 
8.1 and current version Windows 
10. Each version incorporates with 
distinguishable features.
Adding Mac OS X as the desktop 
computing operating system, Mac OS 
X is going with the latest trends and 
other technologies. It was the first 
successful Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) before Windows. Putting light on 
some features of Mac OS X, we have 
no viruses unlike windows, better look 
than windows, extensions. Macintosh 
OS X is simple, powerful, advance and 
more secure than windows. Mac OS

X provides its hardware platform for 
users. It is more user friendly but not 
flexible. Being enough powerful, Mac 
OS X command line tools seems to be 
helpful in administrative tasks. As Mac 
OS X is based on Linux, that’s why Mac 
OS X is more secure than Windows. 
Mac OS X doesn’t provide 
portability. It is connected with the 
machine which it was using. Mac OS X is 
the most expensive Operating Systems, 
including hardware cost too. A normal 
user can easily get to know that there is 
no functioning delete key in it. Mac OS 
X’s Lion, home network, voiceover, video 
chat services, Airdrop are nowadays 
popular among users.
Linux is an Open-source operating 
system which means the source code 
of the operating system (kernel) can be 
downloaded, installed, analyzed, modify 
and used for creating applications by 
developers. They make changes in 
each new version of Linux operating 
system and update this version as a new 
version. Each version in Linux is called 
‘Distribution’. Many new and different 
distributions can be operated at no 
cost. About hundreds of Linux versions 
have been developed and thousands 
of developers work upon it. Linux is 
more secure than any other operating 
systems. It provides security by providing 
enough ‘privileges’ or ‘root’ access to 
the users. Another merit is that being 
open-source Linux is customizable and 
has full control under user. Apart from 
its less cost, another feature is ‘live boot 
system’, so no technical knowledge or 
more time is required for installation. 
Any new user will surely find Linux 
more interesting and customizable in 
his own way. There is less numbers of 
softwares which are available for Linux 
desktop. While the standard programs 
like searching the web, mail services, 
editing, printing of documents can also 
be easily done using Linux. 
The current distribution of Linux 
operating system is ‘fedora’ which 
takes fewer amounts of disk space 
and memory as compared to Windows 
and Mac OS X. The open-source nature 
of any operating systems makes it 
user-friendly, customizable and more 
secure from viruses. Linux is FREE 
to use that means we can download 
and alter it without paying any kind of 
charges. Except all these, Linux is still 
not a complete operating system, it 
is just kernel, so additional software 
are needed to be installed. This 
corresponds to very few market shares 
among laptop and desktop PCs. Leaving 
all its advantages back, Linux is much 
better in performance. There are many 
other operating systems that are used 
at low level among users.
Conclusion/Future Work
Among all these, which operating 
system has to be chosen? This decision 
solely depends on particular user’s 
choice. All operating systems are 
loaded with variety of features. For 
gaming, we can use Windows, for 
programmers and developers Linux and 
Mac OS X for graphics/video producers. 
But still, there are some requirements 
which need to be noted. For example, 
dealing with bugs in operating system 
and application softwares, to deal with 
viruses, worms etc. We could have 
extensions like one point access for 
applications and their tracking, checking 
apps performance, portability of 
applications on different environments. 
Maintaining backup for all applications 
is also necessary. Interchanging of data 
among different applications needs to 
facilitate. Moreover, an operating system 
distinguishes different platforms and 
focuses on bright future for innovation. 
Every operating system has some 
advantages and disadvantages, but 
using which one, this depends on user’s 
convenience. There is still innovative 
technology coming in the field of 
operating systems.

The battle for the Best Smartphone OS
 S. N. Kakarwal
 Professor in Department of Computer Science & Engineering of 
 P.E.S. College of Engineering, Aurangabad
Now a day’s rapidly emerging 
technology is wireless mobile phone 
technology in telecommunication zone. 
This mobile device has great impact on 
everyone’s life. Consequently, when we 
wanted to purchase a mobile device we 
consider two criteria before selecting 
a mobile device. Firstly, we study is the 
details of devices such as the appealing 
look of the device, its performance, 
hardware details such as camera type, 
its pixel resolution, etc. Secondarily, 
we study the type of  mobile operating 
system used by the device.
A mobile operating system 
is software stack used by mobile 
devices  such as smartphones, tablets, 
laptops to manage their resources 
and to run applications and programs. 
Mobile operating systems example 
includes Apple iOS, Google Android, 
BlackBerry OS, Nokia’s Symbian and 
Microsoft’s Windows Phone OS.
In this article, we make assessment 
of emerging mobile OS, Android OS and 
iPhone OS and finally compares the 
recent versions of them, viz., Android 
7.0 Nougat with Apple iOS 10.
Android OS
Android is open source OS which 
isgrounded on Linux kernel designed for 
mobile devices such as smart phones 
and tablet PCs. Android OS is owned by 
Google, Inc. in July 2005 and becomes a 
key for Google to jump into the wireless 
technology. Latest version of Android is 
Android 7 released in October 16.
Structural design of Android OS 
Four layers of Android OS are Linux 
Kernel, System libraries, Application 
framework and user interface layer 
(as in figure 1). At the bottom most 
layer of Android OS Architecture is the 
Linux kernel copes with virtual memory 
management, power management 
and networking management and 
basic communication management. 
System libraries integrated with SQLite 
framework which provides storage of 
data. System libraries include 2D and 
3Dgraphics API. SGL is 2D graphics 
engine and open GL/ES provides 3D 
graphics API. System libraries packaged 
with Webkit engine for rendering web 
pages in mobile browser. Android 
run time is rooted with Dalvik Virtual 
Machine (DVM), which gives power to the 
applications. The application framework 
includes android SDK which provides 
libraries for building applications. At top 
most layer of Android OS architecture is 
the User interface layer which provides 
contacts. Also Widgets are included 
to truly customize your home screen 
to your needs, by presenting live, 
continually updating information.
User Interface
Application Framework
Libraries
Linux Kernel
Fig. 1 : Android OS Architecture
Advantages of Android OS:
  Easy access for latest public 
standard like social media sites, 
Google search engines, etc.
  Enables the programmers to make 
changes in Linux kernel to modify 
original applications.
  Availability of More than 2.6 million 
Apps in play store.
  Easy access to best apps from play 
store.
  Supports execution of multiple 
applications concurrently.
  Supports reliable and enhanced 
storage of data (using SQLite 
framework).
  Supports Bluetooth connectivity.
Disadvantages of Android OS:
  Battery backup is poor since large 
number of daemon processes 
increases the usage of RAM.
  While updating applications some 
of applications might have bugs 
which can be misused by hackers.
iPhone OS
iOS is Apple’s closed (with open 
source components) operating system 
developed for iPhone, but later extended 
to support for iPad and Apple TV.   It is 
Unix based OS as iOS root comes from 
Mac OS. Latest version of iPhone is 
iPhone 10 released in June 16.
Structural design of iPhone OS 
Cocoa Touch
Media
Core Services
Core OS
Fig. 2 : iPhone OS Architecture
At the bottom most layer of iPhone 
OS architecture, there is Core OS 
layer. The Core OS layer copes with 
the file handling, low level networking, 
memory management, inter process 
communication and security 
management. Core services layer 
includes fundamental system services 
for apps as well as framework for 
networking. Media layer incorporates 
several frameworks to deal with 2D and 
3D graphics, audio, video functionality, 
and animations.  At the top most is the 
Cocoa Touch layer based on Cocoa API 
to develop graphical applications and 
used by application developer.
Advantages of iOS:
  Easy access for latest public

standard like social media sites, 
Google search engines, etc.
  Supports for cloud storage.
  Availability of More than 2.2 
millionApps in App Store.
  Easy access to best apps from App 
store.
  Reduces the risk of infection from 
malicious software since Apple 
does not allow people to load third-
party programs on the device.
  Beautifully designed desktop and 
app icons with the fabulous looks 
of Apple devices.
Disadvantages of iOS:
  Supports only Apple Hardware.
  Not an open source OS.
  Very costly Apps.
Comparative Study of Android OS and 
iOS
The table1 depicts the comparison 
table of Android OS and iOS
Apple and Google just released iOS 
10 and Android 7.0 Nougat, respectively. 
This is major news since most of the 
smartphones today either run on 
Android or iOS. 
Some notable features of  iOS 10 and 
Android 7.0 Nougat  
Notifications
  In iOS 10, 3D Touch is immersed, 
permitting to expand notifications 
and initiate quick responses and 
other actions. 
  Android Nougat’s notifications 
now take up more of the screen 
which, combined with a change of 
font, provides more information as 
standard. 
Messaging
  In iOS 10, your messages threads 
can be plastered with icons and 
animations. More ever, iMessage 
can implement its own type of 
third-party apps into it.
  Android Nougat came with 
WhatsApp-like messaging app 
known as Allo to incorporate search 
and machine learning technology.
Personal Assistants
  In iOS 10, Siri has greatly enhanced. 
Apart from getting, the personal 
assistant enhanced features, 
it is opened up to third-party 
developers so they can link into 
Siri—making her usefulness grows 
exponentially. 
  Siri’s big competitor on Android is 
Google Now. 
Though, Apple and Google have 
started with different ways to design 
their effective and efficient mobile OS, 
iOS 10 and Android Nougat have shown 
they are gradually uniting. Apple is 
attempting to close the gap on Google 
in terms of widgets and third-party 
app, while Google is attempting to 
implement app icon shortcuts and app 
notification groupings like Apple.In the 
battle of the OS, the winner will depend 
on your preference. Android is more 
customizable but Apple is more refined 
in terms of security and system.

Operating Systems :  
Mass transit for the future
 R. Gobi
 Faculty in Computer Applications, National Institute of Technology, Trichy
Operating system has been 
changing since every generation or era 
that we have had so far, and we can 
expect it to change even more in the 
near future to come. Mobile operating 
systems especially have never failed 
to surprise techies with the incredible 
features they provide. In the future, 
approximately in 10 years from now, we 
can expect a mobile or a smartphone 
capable of doing the unexpected. A 
mobile phone is now considered a part 
of every human being; every individual 
is observed owning a smartphone, 
and some even own more than one. 
The day begins with one checking out 
the notifications early in the morning, 
even before they get off their beds, 
and it ends with the same thing in the 
night, just before they go to sleep. In 
the future, this mobile phone is going 
to be more of a personal assistant to a 
particular owner. We are going to see 
significant innovation from developers 
in this space.
The operating system of the 
future would connect every device 
the user wants to connect to from 
their mobile phones– starting from 
personal computers at homes or 
offices, cameras, cars and even the 
home security systems. Everything can 
be controlled from any location just by 
one click on the mobile device. This is 
something that the current technology 
is already leading us to. In the years 
to come, we can expect the concept of 
Internet of Things to be a reality more 
than an idea or an experiment. The 
mobile OS of the future is going to be an 
implementation of the same.
In the future, we would not require 
a personal computer or a desktop as 
much as we do today; with the mobile 
operating system to arrive. Every task 
that can be done on a computer will 
be done on the mobile phone. It is 
going to be an integration of Artificial 
intelligence, networking and connecting 
to the society. The hand held devices 
will consist of an interface with the user 
in which, the smartphone can detect 
body temperature of the user holding 
the device, and from previously acquired 
data, it would recommend a doctor’s 
appointment if it found the temperature 
was not within the normal limits.
The operating system of the mobile 
device will identify if it is in the wrong 
hands, and this it will find out from 
usage statistics, pattern, and an in-built 
polygraph that would detect the user’s 
authenticity. If in any case it identifies 
any suspicious or abnormal use of the 
smart device, it will lock itself which 
could then only be unlocked externally 
by the original user, through a bio 
metric key.
The trend of the future is going to 
be of a wearable device. The mobile 
operating system would also consist of 
a system which connects to a wearable 
device like a watch, so one need not 
constantly remove their mobile phones 
to check for updates. The possibilities 
with devices that you wear on your body 
are endless. There will be a time in which 
people can receive calls on something 
known as a fingertip technology. A 
person would make and receive calls 
without touching the mobile phone. This 
can be done by a click on the wearable 
device and the voice signals will be 
transmitted through the person’s body, 
so one can listen to the other person, 
by just keeping the forefinger near his 
or her ear. A microphone fitted to the 
wearable device would complete the 
communication so that the person 
on the other side of the phone can 
hear you well. It would offer these and 
many other features keeping in mind, 
low battery consumption and efficient 
usage of the memory.
The mobile operating system of 
the future is going to be a wonderland 
in itself. It would offer a plethora of 
features. But, simultaneously, it would 
detect over use of the device. With the 
increasing amounts of complaints 
from the traditional Luddites and other 
rational thinkers who believe that 
technology is deteriorating people’s 
health, it would be taken care of in the 
operating system. The system would 
lock itself out for a particular amount of 
time or keep popping up a notification, 
where the user of the smartphone is 
expected to do some physical activity, 
or any other activity which does not 
involve use of the mobile phones. 
Every technology ages; the only thing 
that doesn’t get old is connecting with 
people.

RSOS: Reliable and Secure Operating System
 Ashutosh Saxena
 Adjunct Professor CS, Email: saxenaaj@gmail.com
Did you recollect when your 
landline phone got hanged, probably 
you do not remember either it really did 
not happened or you are using smart 
mobile phone for a long time. Then, 
did you remember when your elegant 
smart phone got hanged while you were 
running few applications? Probably 
last month!!. Let me extend the query: 
when was your TV stuck while you were 
watching favourate show or movie, in 
contrast, how many times your laptop 
got hanged while you were playing the 
DVD? All are electronics devices with 
processors, several interfaces, I/O 
ports and an operating system (OS) 
running for you to provide the desired 
functionality. It is the OS on computers/
smart phones that provides flexibility, 
where you can load, install and execute 
external software, whereas on the TV 
you may not enjoy that level of freedom, 
reason being a very small with focussed 
functionality OS is being embedded 
in TV sets which does not fall in prey 
hands.
The popular operating systems 
have two characteristics which makes 
them unreliable and insecure 1) they are 
very large in size and 2) they have very 
poor fault isolation. The Linux kernel 
has over 2.5 million lines of code and 
Windows XP is twice more than Linux. A 
study [1] of software reliability conveys 
it contains 6-16 bugs per 1000 lines 
of executable code while a different 
one [2] states that  the fault density at 
2-75 bugs per 1000 lines of executable 
code. To be on a conservative end one 
can estimate of 6 bugs per 1000 lines 
of code the Linux kernel probably has 
something like 15,000 bugs, Windows 
has as at least double, not sure mobile 
OS for smart phones!! Further, to 
make matters worse, typically about 
70% of the operating system consists 
of device drivers, and they have error 
rates 3 to 7 times higher than ordinary 
code [3]. It is also true that finding and 
correcting all these bugs is simply not 
always feasible, and bug fixes frequently 
introduce new bugs. Any modern 
operating system contains hundreds 
or thousands of procedures linked 
together as a single binary program 
running in kernel mode. Any one line 
from the millions of lines of kernel code 
can overwrite key data structures used 
by an unrelated component and crash 
the system which is difficult to detect. 
In addition, if a virus or worm manages 
to infect one kernel procedure, there 
is no way to keep it away from rapidly 
spreading to others and taking control 
of the whole machine. The challenge in 
developing operating systems security 
is to design security mechanisms that 
protect process execution and their 
generated data in an environment with 
such complex interactions. However, 
these mechanisms do not account or 
only partially account for the complexity 
of practical systems. The current state 
of operating systems security takes 
two forms: (1) constrained systems 
that can enforce security goals with 
a high degree of assurance and (2) 
general-purpose systems that can 
enforce limited security goals with a 
low to medium degree of assurance. An 
ideal secure operating system provides 
security mechanisms that ensure that 
the system’s security goals are enforced 
despite the threats faced by the system. 
Thus the basic security  mechanism 
improves the reliability of system 
software by protecting it from the most 
obvious source of unreliability; namely, 
user programming errors.
Reliability
Reliable software provides services 
that are adequate for the intended 
application with respect to being: 
usable, correct, and trustworthy.
Usable means that the user 
receives services that are effective 
for his application. Correct means 
that the software meets its functional 
specifications. If the specifications are 
incomplete, then correct software may 
not be usable. Trustworthy means that 
there is a minimum level of services 
that is provided correctly, and there is 
an effective way to evaluate or measure 
the performance of the software with 
respect to the minimum level of service. 
Software may be correct even if there 
is no effective way to demonstrate its 
correctness; however, trustworthy 
software must be structured so that 
testing, auditing, and/or proofs of 
correctness can be used to achieve a 
reasonable level of confidence in the 
software.
Security
Security goals describe how the 
system implements accesses to system 
resources that satisfy the following: 
secrecy, integrity, and availability. A 
system access is traditionally stated in 
terms of which subjects (e.g., processes 
and users) can perform which 
operations (e.g., read and write) on 
which objects (e.g., files and sockets). 
Secrecy requirements limit the objects 
that individual subjects can read 
because objects may contain secrets 
that not all subjects are permitted to 
know. Integrity requirements limit the 
objects that subjects can write because 
objects may contain information that 
other subjects depend on for their 
correct operation. Some subjects 
may not be trusted to modify those 
objects. Availability requirements 
limit the system resources (e.g., 
storage and CPU) that subjects may 
consume because they may exhaust 
these resources. Much of the focus in 
secure operating systems is on secrecy 
and integrity requirements, although 
availability may indirectly impact these 
goals as well.
In general, security provisions 
must be as simple and rigid as possible 
in order to minimize the danger 
of oversights and of human error. 
Nevertheless, for security in a computer 
operating system, the flexibility is 
desirable for the following reasons:
(1)  System security will be attacked 
at its weakest point. It makes little 
sense to build extremely rigorous

A R T I C L E
security barriers if there is a back 
door into the system that is left 
open. 
(2)  A serious danger to security arises 
whenever the need for flexible 
protection is underestimated. If 
protection mechanisms are so 
rigid that they prevent efficient 
processing of information, then the 
protection is usually circumvented. 
A single general protection 
mechanism that is used without 
exception is better than a rigid one 
that has many exceptions.
(3)  Flexible and efficient switching 
between protection domains makes 
it more feasible to build redundant 
security controls. As long as the 
basic protection mechanism itself 
is extremely reliable, redundant 
security checks incorporated in 
software can provide very rigorous 
security control. 
While security and reliability 
requirements vary greatly from one 
application to another, the protection 
mechanisms that are built into the 
hardware and basic software of the 
computer operating system cannot be 
redesigned to meet the needs of each 
application. Thus it is desirable to have 
a basic set of protection mechanisms 
that are versatile enough to meet the 
requirements of many diverse computer 
applications. Small protection domains 
are one of the most promising ways to 
achieve the goal of reliable and secure 
operating system in reducing the 
complexity of large system. As it is quite 
clear that it is far more difficult to build 
a 50,000 line program than it is to write 
1,000 programs that are each 50 lines 
long. This phenomenon leads to rapidly 
escalating costs for the development 
and maintenance of large software 
systems, and it leads to serious 
reliability problems due to the difficulty 
of adequately debugging and testing a 
large program. Both the reliability and 
the cost of software could be greatly 
improved if the complexity of large 
programs could be kept more in line 
with the size of the program. However, 
when a large system is decomposed into 
interacting subsystems, it is important 
to have limits on the interaction of the 
subsystems. These limits should not be 
dependent on the proper functioning 
of all of the subsystems. Othen, the 
subsystem interactions may change 
precisely when one of the subsystems 
fails, thus causing the whole system 
to crash. It is not feasible to eliminate 
all malfunctions from software 
subsystems. On a case-by-case basis, 
careful defensive programming can limit 
the effects of potential malfunctions. A 
more general solution is possible by 
introducing a protection mechanism 
which is distinct from the proper design 
and functionality of the subsystems. 
The role of the protection mechanism is 
precisely to prevent malfunctions from 
spreading beyond the subsystem where 
they occurred. To achieve the desired 
protection, almost every procedure 
should be run in protection domain that 
gives it access to exactly what it needs 
to accomplish its function and nothing 
more, on the principle of least privilege. 
A protection mechanism will not 
prevent every error from propagating 
outside of the erroneous module. Many 
erroneous results of a module will 
appear to be normal results, and the 
protection mechanism will have no way 
of distinguishing these from correct 
results. However, with good system 
design, erroneous results that look like 
expected results should not cause other 
modules to behave in unpredictable 
ways. As long as other modules continue 
to behave in predictable ways, there is a 
much better chance of finding the origin 
of the error. The protection mechanism 
will guard mostly against the errors that 
result from unexpected interactions of 
the modules and are usually the hardest 
to trace.
Trojan Horse Problem
Most access controls only 
guarantee that one user’s information 
is protected from access by other users. 
Unfortunately, it is often not realistic 
for a user to trust all the programs that 
execute as part of his own processing. 
Most users make calls to a large number 
of service routines and other programs 
that the user has not written· himself. 
On most systems, all these routines and 
programs execute with the full access 
privileges of the user. It is possible for 
these programs to perform completely 
unrelated actions e.g. they may access 
any file accessible, by the user, and on 
one or many systems and they can even 
give away access rights to these files. 
Daniel Edwards has given it the very 
descriptive name “Trojan Horse” as it 
involves a foreign or gift program that is 
brought within the walls of a protection 
domain. The gift program can then 
subvert the security of everything 
accessible from that protection domain. 
Programmers and systems personnel 
routinely try out new programs that 
play games, print pictures, or aid in 
the development of better programs. 
The most acute danger from the Trojan 
Horse problem occurs when someone 
executing with system privileges runs 
a program given to him by “a friend”. 
This includes support programs such 
as editors, compilers, and library 
routines. A user may choose to believe 
that programs supplied with the system 
are unlikely to act like a Trojan Horse-
-but this should be recognized as a 
calculated risk.
It might seem that the Trojan 
Horse problem should be solved by 
administrative controls. Systems 
personnel and anyone who has very 
sensitive data should never run a 
program in their protection environment 
unless they trust it. Unfortunately, this 
administrative solution is often not 
practical unless the system makes 
it easy to run untrusted programs in 
a restricted protection environment 
where they can do little harm. Finding 
a reasonable solution to the Trojan 
Horse problem is probably the most 
challenging aspect of developing an 
adequate set of system security controls.
Three distinct aspects of the Trojan 
Horse problem must be distinguished 
when a foreign or untrusted program is 
to be run on a system:
(1)  The foreign program is expected 
to modify sensitive data. In this 
case the foreign program must 
be thoroughly examined so that it 
can be trusted. If the program is to 
alter data, then it must be trusted 
with respect to that data.
(2)  The foreign program is expected 
to read sensitive data but not 
disclose its contents except to the 
calling program. This is called the 
confinement problem. It is difficult 
enough to prevent a program 
from hiding the information in 
a file or other form of storage;

however, it is even more difficult to 
prevent it from communicating the 
information via a covert channel. 
Covert communications channels 
can be created by encoding the 
information in the program’s 
resource utilization. For example, 
a program might communicate one 
bit to another program by using 
10 minutes of CPU time if the bit 
is 1, and only using a fraction of 
a second if the bit is 0. The other 
program has to be able to detect or 
estimate the execution time of the 
first program, possibly by simply 
observing the performance of the 
system. Much higher data rates 
can be achieved by encoding the 
information in paging rates, disk 
utilization, or in the locking and 
unlocking of files. 
(3)  The foreign program is run on 
behalf of a user who has access to 
sensitive data, but the untrusted 
program is not expected to access 
any sensitive data. This problem 
should be easy to solve; however, 
the solution is difficult to enforce 
with the protection mechanisms 
available on most existing 
computer systems.
If security depends in part on the 
compilers, then the compilers would 
also have to be validated for security. 
While it may be easier to validate a 
compiler than to validate an operating 
system, the validation of several 
compilers in addition to the validation 
of parts of the operating system would 
make security validation more difficult. If 
the operating system is written in a high 
level language, then the correctness 
of the compiler for that language is a 
security concern. 
Conclusion 
In an attempt to design OS that is 
reliable and support rigorous security, 
narrow and short term focus is not 
advisable. Many security controls might 
not be cost-effective if they were not 
needed to improve the reliability and 
the overall performance, in particular 
: 1) the complexity of most existing 
OS make it very difficult to achieve 
security. To guarantee security OS 
must be structured so that interactions 
between system modules are more 
clearly defined and closely controlled 
which will also ensure the reliability 
and may improve the performance. 2) 
the protection mechanisms needed for 
security can also be used to enforce 
s/w modularity. Such modularity would 
improve the reliability and correctness 
of the s/w. In particular, debugging 
and testing would be easier to the 
extent that the effects of an error can 
be confined within the module where 
the error occurs. Since the debugging 
and testing of the account for half 
of the project cost these protection 
mechanisms amy help in reducing the 
overall cost. It is an ambitious goal to 
design an OS that satisfies rigorous 
security requirements, supports 
reliable software and at the same time 
meets the performance, flexibility, 
sharing, and compatibility requirements 
that are needed to make a computer 
competitive in the marketplace. 
Decreasing hardware costs are making 
these goals much more feasible. The 
recent demonitarization in the country 
along with ever-growing connectivity 
and e-commerce over the Internet, 
application security is an ultimate 
goal for millions of merchants and 
consumers who turn their business 
and service electronic and to the public 
world of cyberspace. On the other 
hand, efforts to achieve total security 
of such systems continue to be based 
on the flawed promise that adequate 
security can be achieved in applications 
with the current security mechanisms 
of mainstream operating system [4]. 
The reality is that secure applications 
demand secure operating systems, and 
tackling application compromises at 
the OS level by kernel-enforced controls 
should probably be considered as an 
attractive and effective approach.

day of Computer Society of India (CSI) which took birth on 6th 
March, 1965 at DRDO campus Hyderabad. As part of this
