 
School of Computer Science
 
Carnegie Mellon's Computer Science
Program has established an interna-
tional reputation as a leading center
for computer science education and
research. Research is organized into
four primary areas: programming sys-
tems, computer systems, artificial
intelligence, and theoretical computer
science. The School includes approxi-
mately 80 faculty, 115 technical and
administrative staff members, 175
graduate students, and 10 visiting sci-
entists.
Numerous governmental and industri-
al organizations—including the DoD,
NSF, NIH, IBM, Digital Equipment,
Intel, Sun, MicroSoft and Apple Com-
puter—generously support our work.
 
Speech Research Laboratory
 
Since its inception over twenty years
ago, the Carnegie Mellon Speech
Research Laboratory has made major
contributions to the field. In 1972 we
developed the first connected-speech
understanding system, H
 
EARSAY
 
-I.
Work on the D
 
RAGON
 
 system (1975)
led to formulating the speech interpre-
tation problem as one of hidden Mark-
ov modeling. H
 
EARSAY
 
-II (1976)
introduced the “blackboard model” as
a problem-solving mechanism for sys-
tems having diverse, cooperating
knowledge sources.
Our H
 
ARPY
 
 system (1976) was the
first to use beam search for solving the
exponential graph-search problem.
The system was subsequently imple-
mented as a special-purpose architec-
ture with real-time performance: the
Harpy Machine (1979).
In 1982 we developed F
 
EATURE
 
, a
speaker-independent alphabet recogni-
tion system based on phonetic feature-
extraction. In 1987 we demonstrated
S
 
PHINX
 
—the first 1000-word, speaker-
independent, connected-speech recog-
nition system performing at better than
95% word accuracy. Based on S
 
PHINX
 
-
II and S
 
PHINX
 
-III, our current systems,
such as ATIS, consistently lead the
field in performance.
 
 Speech Consortium
 
To broaden the Speech Laboratory's
participation base and to facilitate rap-
id transfer of new technologies into
industry, the School has established the
Carnegie Mellon Speech Consortium.
The Consortium provides a compre-
hensive window into speech research,
enabling members to obtain state-of-
the-art information and to develop
technical expertise in automated
speech recognition. 
 
Opportunity
 
Corporations interested in applying
speech technology within their opera-
tions or products are invited to join the
Carnegie Mellon Speech Consortium.
Members receive the following direct
benefits:
• Eligibility to receive all non-pro-
prietary data and software on a 
non-exclusive, royalty-free basis. 
• The Portable Speech Library: soft-
ware that can aid a participant to 
quickly establish a state-of-the-art 
facility for speech recognition. 
The Library includes both discrete 
and semi-continuous recognition 
systems, plus training software for 
acoustic and language models and 
for spoken language parsing (the 
P
 
HOENIX
 
 system). We will update 
the Library regularly and encour-
age members to submit enhance-
ments. 
• Early notification of new develop-
ments and access to source code, 
to maximize opportunities for 
commercial advantage. 
• Direct contact with established 
leaders in speech recognition and 
opportunities to consult with 
members of the Speech Research 
Laboratory.
• Early acquaintance with graduate 
students who will lead future 
research in the field. 
Corporate membership in the Speech
Consortium is based on an initial con-
tribution of $250,000, renewable annu-
ally at $125,000.
It is possible to arrange for employees
of the Consortium member to join the
Speech Research Laboratory for a
period of up to a year, at a cost of
$65,000 per employee. Doing so cre-
ates the opportunity to train individu-
als and enhances the possibilities for
technology transfer.
