This study aims at developing a Japanese pronunciation training system, with special consideration to the 
learners’ speech with errors. To give appropriate instructions for non-native speakers of Japanese, we, 
firstly analyzed the collected learners’ speech and labeled all the errors into 39 categories. Secondly, to 
develop an original speech recognition system for learners’ speech which contains various kinds of errors, 
we constructed a phoneme model based on both native and learners database. Using this model, we 
developed a Japanese pronunciation training system which can recognize and evaluate the speech of 
different L1 learners. We tentatively evaluated the system with Vietnamese learners to ensure the 
effectiveness and usability of the system. 
 
 
1. Purpose 
With the increasing number of learners of 
Japanese as a second language, a supporting system 
for self-learning of Japanese pronunciation has 
become vital. The system needs to be easily 
accessible via WWW and available for the personal 
computers with simple and standard specification. 
Given this background, the purpose of this study is 
to develop a Japanese pronunciation training system, 
especially focusing on the phonemic segments, 
using speech recognition techniques, and to 
evaluate the system with the cooperation of 
Vietnamese learners and to ensure the effectiveness 
of the system as an L1-Specified supporting tool1.  
 
2. Methods & Procedures 
As a course ware for Japanese pronunciation 
practice, the learning process of this system can be 
                                                  
1 We have chosen the Vietnamese learners of Japanese 
as evaluators, firstly because the Vietnamese learner is 
often pointed out to be one of the most difficult learners 
with whom to correct the pronunciation, and secondly 
because the first author specializes in Vietnamese 
phonology and phonetics, so we have the background to 
make contrastive analysis of Japanese and Vietnamese 
phonological systems and phonetic features. 
described as Fig. 1. The learners’ input is evaluated 
to give appropriate feedback to the learners 
automatically. The feedback is provided from both 
articulatory and acoustic points of view. A listening 
practice menu is also provided for learners to 
practice to distinguish the minimal pairs of 
phonemes.

To make the system available for learners’ 
practice, we need to construct a phoneme model 
that is available for the recognition of learners’ 
speech. Firstly we have analyzed 956 speech data 
which contain the reading voices of the text book of 
Japanese by learners of Japanese with diverse L1, 
such as Chinese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, etc. 
Secondly we categorized the segmental errors into 
39 types and labeled all the segments in the data. 
And finally, we constructed the phoneme model, 
using both native and learners’ data, available for 
the learners’ speech recognition and error detection.  
Concerning the acquisition of learners’ data, we 
collected the speech data of phoneme-balanced 10 
sets of sentences quoted from the reading textbook 
of preliminary level, read by 965 learners in all at 
Naganuma School. Those learners contain 187 
learners from Taiwan, 180 from Korea, 123 from 
Thai, 114 from Vietnam, 75 from China, etc. To 
construct the error-tag set for data labeling, we 
surveyed the literature to make the preliminary 
version which contains 28 types. After carrying out 
the trial labeling, we have revised the tag set with 
39 types as Table 1. Based on the learners’ labeled 
data together with the native ones, we have 
constructed the phoneme model for learners’ speech

recognition, using the Japanese phoneme model for 
native speech already constructed by Advanced 
Media, Inc. 
As an evaluation process of the proto-type, we 
have conducted a one-week trial program to be used 
by 16 Vietnamese learners with pre- and post-tests 
to evaluate the effectiveness of learning as well as 
questionnaire to see user friendliness. 16 
Vietnamese learners contain 2 learners from Thai 
Binh province, 5 from Nam Dinh, 5 from Thanh 
Hoa, 3 from Da Nang, and 1 from Tien Giang. The 
results of pre- and post-tests were evaluated by 5 
teachers at Naganuma School as for the segments 
(in 176 moras) contained in the test sentences. 
Questionnaires of 5-level rating were also used to 
see users’ affective dimensions: Enjoyable? 
Usable? Easy to use? Like to use again? Useful? 
 
3. Results 
The proto type of the present system consists of 
the top page, input & evaluation portion, practice & 
instruction portion, intensive practice portion, and 
listening practice portion. 
On the top page, learners can jump to any menu 
as they like. However, a recommended course is 
shown: pronunciation check (input & evaluation) 
→ practice record → pronunciation practice 
(practice & instruction, intensive practice)/listening 
practice. 
In the input & evaluation menu, learners are 
required to input their speech through reading the 
given sentences shown on the top line of the page 
together with a prosody graph so that they can 
concentrate on the practice of phonemic segments. 
After the input process, learners can check the 
sounds, pitch contours, intensity, waveforms of 
both model and their own speech with the error 
detection of 5-level evaluation as shown in Fig. 2. 
  In practice & instruction menu, pronunciation 
practice contents generated automatically based on 
the results of input & evaluation menu are given. 
Here, some articulation figures are used as feedback 
 
 
Fig. 2. Input & evaluation menu 
for the errors concerning place and manner of 
articulation, such as error types of 05-14; 17-22; 
28-29; 31-36 and 38 in the error-tag set. Prosody 
graphs are used for the error types of 01-04; 15-16; 
27 and 37. Waveforms and prosody graphs are for 
24-26. 
  In the intensive practice menu, learners can check 
the acoustic feedback for their own speech which 
will supplement the articulatory feedback given in 
the instruction menu. Here, waveforms are also 
used for error types of 01-04; spectrograms for 
09-11; 17-18; 20; 31-32; 36 and 38; spectrograms 
& pitch contours for 05-06; vowel charts for 23; 
27-29; 33-34; and vowel charts & spectrograms for 
22 and 30 (see Fig. 3.).

  Learners can also conduct the listening practice 
menu right after the input & evaluation menu. After 
the sample practice, learners are required to select 
the pronounced one from the minimal pair of words 
within limited time as shown in Fig.4.

4. Evaluation  
The results of questionnaires about the users’ 
affective dimensions in general are shown in Fig.5., 
while those of questionnaires asking about 
usefulness of the main functions of the system is 
shown in Fig.6. 
  In pre- and post-tests, the trial users read 8 test 
sentences and 5 teachers of Naganuma School 
evaluated all the segments contained therein. We 
can see the rate of improvement and appearance of 
new errors. Table 2 shows the numbers of improved 
segments, remaining errors, and new errors in 
post-tests for every learner.

5. Conclusions and Future Directions 
We developed the proto-type of a pronunciation 
training system for Japanese phonemic segments 
using speech recognition techniques. We carried out 
a preliminary evaluation of the system through a 
trial use by Vietnamese learners. 
Results of the questionnaire show that the scores 
of the users’ affective dimensions were all at a 
higher level, 4~4.6 (the perfect score being 5), 
while scores regarding usefulness of each function 
of the system include some below 4, especially for 
the cases containing literal feedback in Japanese. 
Results of pre- and post-tests show that about 61% 
of the errors in the pre-test were improved, but new 
errors still occurred in post-test at the rate of 29% 
compared with the total amount in the pre-test. 
Especially, typical errors for Vietnamese learners, 
such as [j] > [z] (for the Northern Vietnamese), are 
well recognized and improved. 
As future directions, literal feedback in learners’ 
first language is highly required as shown in the 
questionnaires. And prosodic evaluating function is 
also required, because in case of Vietnamese 
learners, some segmental errors, such as long/short 
vowels, are closely related with the prosodic 
features (Shimizu 2007).
