I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Speech is the most common form of communication among the human beings. There are various languages in the 
world that are spoken by human beings for communication [1]. Researchers are trying to develop the system which can 
analyze and classify the speech signal [2]. The computers system which can understand the spoken language can be 
very useful in various areas like agriculture, health care and government sectors etc. Speech recognition refers to the 
ability of listening spoken words and identifies various sounds present in it, and recognizes them as words of some 
known language [3]. Speech signals are quasi-stationary signals. When speech signals are examined over a short period 
of time (5-100 msec), its characteristics are stationary; but, for a longer period of time the signal characteristics 
changes; it reflects to the different speech sounds being spoken. Features are extracted from the speech signals on the 
basis of short term amplitude spectrum (phonemes). Feature extraction is the most important phase in speech 
recognition system. There are some problems which are faced during the feature extraction process because of the 
variability of the speakers [4].  
This paper gives the comparative study of some of the mostly used feature extraction techniques for Speech 
Recognition system. The rest of the paper is divided as follows: section 2 describes what is meant by feature extraction, 
section 3 describes commonly used feature extraction techniques, and section 4 compares the feature extraction 
techniques. Conclusion is mentioned in Section 5. 
 
II. RELATED WORK 
 
Over the years a number of different methodologies have been proposed for isolated word and continuous speech 
recognition.  These can usually be grouped in two classes: speaker-dependent and speaker-independent. 
 
Speaker dependent methods usually involve training a system to recognize each of the vocabulary words uttered single 
or multiple times by a specific set of speakers [5, 6]  while for speaker independent systems such training methods are 
generally not applicable and words are recognized by analyzing their inherent acoustical properties [7,8]. Various 
features have been used singly or in combination with others to model the speech signals, ranging from Linear

Crossing with Peak Amplitude and Relative Spectra Filtering (RASTA).   
1. Linear Predictive Coding (LPC): 
Based on a highly simplified model for speech production, the linear prediction coding (LPC) algorithm is one of the 
earliest standardized coders, which works at low bit-rate inspired by observations of the basic properties of speech 
signals and represents an attempt to mimic the human speech production mechanism. 
Thiang et. al. Developed speech recognition system using LPC for controlling movement of mobile robot. He used LPC 
as a feature extracting method because it is powerful method for speech analysis; therefore, it is fast and simple, yet an 
effective method for estimating the main parameters of speech signal [9]. 
Omesh Wadhwani et.al. recognised the vernacular language speech for discrete word using  LPC technique. He used 
this method for better interpretation of spoken words [10]. 
Urmila Shrawankar et. al. stated that LPC is the most powerful and useful method for encoding quality speech at low 
bit rate. She stated, in LPC, a specific speech sample at current time can be approximated as linear combination of past 
speech sample. 
2. Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW): 
Maruti Limkar et.al. developed an ASR system for English letter (0-9) using DTW. He stated that DTW is used to 
detect the nearest recorded voice and to discriminate the speech data model into respective classes [11]. 
Ingyin Khaing is used DTW for developing continuous speech recognition system for Myanmar language. He used 
DTW for feature clustering [12]. 
3. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Co-efficient (MFCC): 
MFCC is one of the most powerful speech feature extraction technique and works on human auditory perception 
system. Vibha Tiwari developed text based speaker recognition system using MFCC [13]. 
Lindasalwa Muda et. al. is developed voice recognition system. He used MFCC as feature extraction technique [14]. 
4. Relative Spectra processing (RASTA): 
Hajer Rahali is used RASTA method to extract the relevant information from the audio signal. The main goal of the 
work is to improve the robustness of speech recognition system in additive noise and real time reverberant environment 
[15]. 
Hynek Hermansky et. al. discussed relationship with human auditory perception system and extend the original metho 
to the combination of additive noise and convolution noise. He used band pass filter of time trajectories of logarithmic 
parameter of speech [16]. 
5. Zero Crossing with Peak Amplitude (ZCPA):  
Young-Giu Jung et. al. is developed an optimal feature extraction for throat signal analysis using throat microphone. He 
used this technique to improve recognition rate of the system. This microphone is used to minimize the impact of 
environment noise [17]. 
Ying Sun developed an emotion speech recognition system using ZCPA. He proposed ZCPA for feature extraction by 
studying the length of frame and human auditory characteristics [18].   
 
III. FEATURE EXTRACTION 
 
Feature extraction is a basic and fundamental pre processing step to pattern recognition and machine learning problem. 
It's a special form of dimensionality reduction technique which is used to reduce the data which is very large to be 
processed by an algorithm. In feature extraction the provided input data is transformed into a set of features which 
provides the relevant information for performing a desired task without the need of the full size data but using the 
reduced set. The speech recognition technique is having a background of DSP i.e. Digital signal processing. DSP is the 
centre of progress in speech processing during the complete development of the speech processing and speech 
recognition systems [19].  
Feature Extraction is not only used in speech analysis, synthesis, coding, recognition and enhancement but also in voice 
modification, speaker recognition and language identification. Theoretically it is possible to recognize speech directly 
from the digital waveform of the speech. However, as speech is time varying the idea to perform some form of feature 
extraction came into existence which is used to reduce the variability of speech signal. In the context of Automatic 
speech recognition feature extraction is the process of retaining the useful information from the speech signal while the

unnecessary and unwanted information is removed which involves the speech signal analysis. However, while 
removing the unwanted information from the speech signal some useful information may also lose. 
The main objective of feature extraction is to untangle the speech signal into the different acoustically identifiable 
components and to obtain the set of feature with low rate of change in order to keep the computation feasible. The 
feature extraction for speech recognition can be divided in spectral analysis, parametric transformation and statistical 
modelling. This phenomenon is shown in the following fig.1. 
 
 
Fig.1 Feature Extraction Process [20] 
When speech is produced in the sense of time varying signal, its characteristics can be represented via parameterization 
of the spectral activity. There are six major classes of spectral analysis algorithms i.e. Digital filter bank (Power 
estimation), Fourier Transform (FT Derived Filter Bank Amplitudes, FT Derived Cepstral Coefficients), Linear 
Prediction (LP, LP Derived Filer Bank Amplitudes, LP Derived Cepstral Coefficients) used in speech recognition 
system. Signal parameters are generated from signal measurements through two fundamental operations: differentiation 
and concatenation. The output of this stage of processing is a parameter vector containing our raw estimates of the 
signal. 
The third step of the feature extraction process is Statistical Modeling. Here, it assumes that the signal parameters are 
generated from some underlying multivariate random process. To learn the nature of this process, it impose a model on 
the data, optimize (or run) the model, and then measure the quality of the approximation. The only information about 
the process is its observed outputs of the signal parameters that have been computed. For this reason, the parameter 
vector output from this stage of processing is often called the signal observations. A statistical analysis is to be 
performed on the vectors to determine if they are part of a spoken word or phrase or whether they are merely noise. 
 
IV. COMMONLY USED FEATURE EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES FOR SPEECH 
 
In speech recognition, the main goal of the feature extraction step is to compute a sequence of feature vectors providing 
a compact representation of the given input signal. Commonly LPC, MFCC, ZCPA, DTW and RASTA are used as 
feature extraction techniques for speech recognition system.  
 
1.  LINEAR PREDICTIVE CODING (LPC) 
The basic idea behind the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) analysis is that a speech sample can be approximated as 
linear combination of past speech samples.LPC is a frame based analysis of the speech signal which is performed to 
provide observation vectors of speech.LPC feature extraction process can be explained from following figure. The 
input speech signal digitized spectrally flatten speech signal is put through a low order digital system to make it less 
susceptible to finite precision effects later in the signal processing [21]. 
To compute LPC features, initially the speech signal is blocked into frames of N samples.  The output of the pre-
emphasizer network is related to the input to the network. After frame blocking, the next step is to window each 
individual frame so as to minimize the signal discontinuities at the beginning and end of each frame. Typical window is 
the Hamming window. 
The next step is to auto correlate each frame of windowed signal Where the highest autocorrelation value is the order of 
the LPC analysis. The next processing step is the LPC analysis, which converts each frame of autocorrelations into 
LPC parameter set by using Durbin’s method.LPC cepstral coefficients, is a very important LPC parameter set, which 
can be derived directly from the LPC coefficient set.

Fig.2: LPC Feature Extraction Process 
Linear prediction is a mathematical operation which provides an estimation of the current sample of a discrete signal as 
a linear combination of several previous samples. The prediction error i.e. the difference between the predicted and 
actual value is called the residual. If the current sample 𝑥𝑖  of the audio signal be predicted by the past p samples and 
𝑥𝑖
′  is the predicted value then we have: 
𝑥𝑖
′ = −𝑎2𝑥𝑖−1 − 𝑎3𝑥𝑖−2 − ⋯− 𝑎𝑝+1𝑥𝑖−𝑝  
Here {1,𝑎2,...,𝑎𝑝+1 } are the (p+1) filter coefficients. In this case the signal is passed through an LPC filter which 
generates a element feature vector and a scalar which represents the variance of the predicted signal [22]. 
 
2.  MEL-FREQUENCY CEPSTRUM CO-EFFICIENT (MFCC) 
The Mel-frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) technique is often used to create the fingerprint of the sound files. 
The MFCC are based on the known variation of the human ear’s critical bandwidth frequencies with filters spaced 
linearly at low frequencies and logarithmically at high frequencies used to capture the important characteristics of 
speech. The signal is divided into overlapping frames to compute MFCC coefficients. Let each frame consist of N 
samples and let adjacent frames be separated by M samples where M<N. Each frame is multiplied by a Hamming 
window where the Hamming window equation is given by: 
𝑊 𝑛 = 0.54 − 0.46 cos(
2𝜋𝑛
𝑁 − 1
) 
In the third step, the signal is converted from time domain to frequency domain by subjecting it to Fourier Transform. 
The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a signal is defined by the following: 
𝑋𝑘 =  𝑥𝑖𝑒
−
𝑗2𝜋𝑘𝑖
𝑁−1
𝑁−1
𝑖=0
 
In the next step the frequency domain signal is converted to Mel frequency scale, which is more appropriate for human 
hearing and perceptions. This is done by a set of triangular filters that are used to compute a weighted sum of spectral 
components so that the output of the process approximates a Mel scale. Each filter’s magnitude frequency response is 
triangular in shape and equal to unity at the centre frequency and decrease linearly to zero at centre frequency of two 
adjacent filters. The following equation is used to calculate the Mel for a given frequency: 
𝑀 = 2595𝑙𝑜𝑔10 (1 +
𝑓
700
) 
In the next step the log Mel scale spectrum is converted to time domain using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). DCT 
is defined by the following, where is a constant dependent on N: 
𝑋𝑘 = 𝛼  𝑥𝑖 cos  {
 2𝑖 + 1 𝜋𝑘
2𝑁
}
𝑁−1
𝑖=0
 
The result of the conversion is called Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient. The set of coefficients is called acoustic 
vectors. Therefore, each input utterance is transformed into a sequence of acoustic vectors. 
A block diagram of the MFCC processes is shown in Figure. Block diagram of MFCC The speech waveform is 
cropped to remove silence or acoustical interference that may be present in the beginning or end of the sound file. The 
windowing block minimizes the discontinuities of the signal by tapering the beginning and end of each frame to zero. 
The FFT block converts each frame from the time domain to the frequency domain. In the Mel-frequency wrapping 
block, the signal is plotted against the Mel spectrum to mimic human hearing. In the final step, the Cepstrum, the Mel-
spectrum scale is converted back to standard frequency scale. This spectrum provides a good representation of the 
spectral properties of the signal which is key for representing and recognizing characteristics of the speaker.

3.  ZERO CROSSINGS WITH PEAK AMPLITUDES (ZCPA) 
This feature extraction technique is based on Human Auditory System. It uses zero-crossing interval to represent signal 
frequency information and amplitude value to represent intensity information, finally frequency information and 
amplitude information is combined to form the complete feature output. The following figure shows ZCPA principle 
diagram for feature extraction. Block diagram consist of Band Pass Filters (BPF) block, zero-crossing detection block, 
peak detection block, non-linear amplitude compression block and the frequency receiver block [24]. 
 
 
Fig.4 Principle diagram of ZCPA for Feature Extraction Techniques 
The filters block is based on perception of human auditory system, containing 16 BPF, and covers the frequency range 
of 200-4000Hz. The original speech data pass the filter bank and are transformed to 16different data processing paths. 
Speech signal is divided into frames and each frame undergoes the upward going zero-crossing interval detection and 
peaks detections in each interval. The non-linear compression of peak value uses the equation. The equation is a 
monotony function; x represents a peak in the upward going zero-crossing interval. After it is compressed 
logarithmically the result is g(x). This process is to mimic the biological relationship between the hearing nerves 
stimulating intensity and the lock-up intensity. 
g(x) = log(1.0 + 20x) 
Frequency receiving block is to divide the frequency band into several sub-bands, each band is called a frequency bin. 
The 16 path outputs formed together the ZCPA feature. 
The frequency information and the intensity information are combined by the frequency receiver. Separate the 
frequency band of speech signal into several sub-bands by ERB-rate coordinate, and each sub-band is called a 
frequency bin. This paper uses 16 frequency bins, the frequency range is from 156Hz to 4055Hz. Convert the upward 
zero-crossing into the right frequency of frequency bins, and the frequency information can be known by looking up the 
number of the frequency bins[25]. 
In normalization of the time and amplitude section, it is necessary to normalize the time and the amplitude to satisfy the 
training and testing of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. The output feature vector can represent the pitch and 
intensity features of speech. Because pitch and intensity features are typical features of the expression in speech. 
4. DYNAMIC TIME WARPING (DTW) 
DTW algorithm is based on Dynamic Programming. This algorithm is used for measuring similarity between two time 
series which may vary in time or speed. This technique also used to find the optimal alignment between two times 
series if one time series may be “warped” non-linearly by stretching or shrinking it along its time axis. This warping 
between two time series can then be used to find corresponding regions between the two time series or to determine the

similarity between the two time series. To align two sequences using DTW, an n*m matrix where the (ith, jth) element 
of the matrix contains the distance d (qi, cj) between the two points qi and cj is constructed. Then, the absolute distance 
between the values of two sequences is calculated using the Euclidean distance computation as shown in equation: 
d (qi, cj) = 2*(qi - cj) 
Each matrix element (i, j) corresponds to the alignment between the points qi and cj. Then, accumulated distance is 
measured by equation. 
D (i, j) = min [D (i-1, j-1), D (i-1, j), D (i, j -1)] + d (i, j) 
This algorithm performs a piece wise linear mapping of the time axis to align both the signals. The best match or 
alignment between these two sequences is the path through the grid, which minimizes the total distance between them, 
which is termed as Global distance. The overall distance (Global distance) is calculated by finding and going through 
all the possible routes through the grid, each one compute the overall distance. The global distance is the minimum of 
the sum of the distances (Euclidean distance) between the individual elements on the path divided by the sum of the 
weighting function. For any considerably long sequences the number of possible paths through the grid will be very 
large.  Global distance measure is obtained using a recursive formula [26]. 
GDxy = LDxy + min (GDx-1 y-1, GDx-1 y, GDx y-1) 
Here, GD = Global Distance (overall distance),  
          LD = Local Distance (Euclidean distance). 
5. RELATIVE SPECTRAL PROCESSING (RASTA) 
Relative spectral processing [RASTA] based speech enhancement involves linear filtering of the trajectory of the short-
term power spectrum of noisy speech signal, as shown in Figure. The spectral values of input speech signal are 
compressed by a nonlinear compression rule (a=2/3) before performing the filtering operation and expanded after 
filtering (b=3/2). 
 
 
 
Fig.5 Block Diagram of RASTA Method  
To obtain better noise suppression for communication systems the fixed RASTA filters were replaced by abank of non-
causal FIR Wiener-like filters. For 256point FFT, 129 unique filters are required. The output ofeach filter is given as 
𝑆𝑖 𝑘 =  𝑤𝑖 𝑗 𝑌𝑖(𝑘 − 𝑗)
𝑀
𝑗=−𝑀
 
Here, 𝑆𝑖 𝑘 is estimate of clean speech in frequency bin “i” and frame-index “k”, 𝑌𝑖 𝑘 is noisy speech 
spectrum,𝑤𝑖 𝑗 are the weights of the filter and M is order of the filter. In this method the weights𝑤𝑖 𝑗  are obtained 
suchthat 𝑆𝑖 𝑘 is least square estimate of clean speech 𝑆𝑖 𝑘 or each frequency bin i. The order M = 10 corresponds to 21 
tap non-causal filters. The filters were designed based on optimization on 2 minutes of speech of a male speaker 
recorded at 8 kHz sampling over public analog cellular line from a relatively quiet library [13]. The published response 
of the filter corresponding to bins in the frequency range 300Hz to 2300 Hz is a band-pass filter, emphasizing 
modulation frequency around 6-8 Hz. Filters corresponding to the 150-250 Hz and 2700- 4000 Hz regions are low gain,

Table 1--Table for Different Speech Feature Extraction Techniques for Different Languages with Recognition Rate 
The above table shows developed speech recognition systems using different techniques with recognition rate for 
different languages. From table we can conclude that database developed for English language has more recognition 
rate compared to other language. The recognition rate for Automatic Speech Recognition System for English language 
is above 90% while for other language is in between 80-90%. During the study we observed that maximum work is 
done for isolated word recognition system while negligible amount of work is done for continuous speech recognition 
system.   
Linear predictive coding (LPC) is one of the most useful methods for encoding good quality speech at a low bit rate 
and provides extremely accurate estimates of speech parameters. LPC is generally used for speech analysis and 
synthesis. We observed from the study that LPC technique is commonly used in electrical and musical companies for 
making mobile robots, in telephone companies, tonal analysis of violins and other string musical instruments etc. 
Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient's (MFCC) is most commonly used features extraction technique in speech 
recognition systems. The reason for MFCC being most commonly used for extracting features is that it is most nearest 
to the actual human auditory speech perception. MFCC is used to recognize numbers automatically spoken into a 
telephone, airline reservation, voice recognition system for security purpose etc. Some researchers have proposed 
modifications to the basic MFCC algorithm to improve robustness, such as by raising the log-mel-amplitudes to a 
suitable power (around 2 or 3) before taking the DCT, which reduces the influence of low-energy components. 
Zero Crossing Peak Amplitude (ZCPA) is similar to MFCC and mostly used for development of automatic speech 
recognition in noisy environments, speaker identification, throat signal analysis, development of noise robust speech 
recognition system etc. ZCPA provides more accurate and clear description to speech signal, and it does not exhibit the 
information redundancy.

Dynamic Time Wrapping (DTW) has been applied to temporal sequences of video, audio, and graphic. DTW is 
commonly used for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences which may vary in time or speed. It is used 
to cope with different speaking speed, speaker recognition, online signature recognition, and generally used to solve 
time alignment problem, template matching etc. Also it is observed that it can be used in partial shape matching 
application. DTW is a method that can calculate an optimal match between two given sequences with certain 
restrictions. DTW is used to align the utterances properly and calculating the minimum distance between two utterances 
or samples. It is an efficient method to solve the time alignment problem. 
 
Relative Spectra Filtering (RASTA) was originally developed to reduce the sensitivity of recognizers to frequency 
characteristics of an operating environment. RASTA method is generally used for speech analysis in which speech 
signals are enhanced, to develop noise robust speech recognition system and etc. 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
 
In this paper we have studied few of the features extraction techniques used for the development of Automatic Speech 
Recognition System. During the study it was observed that technique has some limitation, sometimes reliability and 
performance of the system is affected. It was also observed that the maximum work in the area of Automatic Speech 
Recognition is for English language. Less work has been carried out for Indian languages. Even the recognition rate for 
the ASR is higher for English language than any other language. The recognition rate for the Indian language is very 
low due to the phonetic nature of Indian language. It was also observed that the researchers have tried single techniques 
for the recognition; there is a need to develop hybrid approach which may give better performance for the development 
of robust speech recognition area. This paper provides the comparative study of the commonly used feature extraction 
techniques for speech recognition. This paper will help the researchers willing to work in the area of speech recognition 
know the basic difference between the discussed feature extraction techniques.
