I. INTRODUCTION 
HE purpose of this paper is to present the illustration of 
different advancement in artificial intelligence, in the 
perspective of speech recognition. It has been established from 
the analysis of research, which was conducted by [5] that 
speech recognition is one of the most advanced concepts of 
electrical engineering and computer science. Basically, this 
approach deals with the conversion of the spoken words into 
text. Speech recognition is also referred as ASR (automatic 
speech recognition), STT (speech to text) or just computer 
speech recognition. On the contrary, it has been claimed by [8] 
that speech recognition can also be understood as the field of 
computer science, which deals with the designing and 
development of computer systems, in order to recognize the 
spoken words. In this regard, [14] has asserted that speech 
recognition or computer speech recognition or ASR is nothing 
more than the approach of converting a speech signal into the 
sequence of words, by the help of different algorithms and

techniques. It has been documented in the research, which was 
carried out by [6] that these approaches include artificial 
intelligence approach, pattern recognition approach, as well as 
acoustic phonetic approach. In accordance with the views and 
perceptions of [7], artificial intelligence is the most developing 
and effective techniques, which supports flawless and accurate 
speech recognition. It is because; artificial intelligence 
incorporates certain algorithmic approaches, which fosters 
coherent conversion and transformation of speech into 
readable patterns, and vice versa.  
This research will assist in understanding these concepts, 
which are associated with speech recognition. Amid all of 
these approaches, artificial intelligence is found to be the most 
effective and integrated approach, which has strengthened and 
improved speech recognition practices [15]. The proceeding 
manuscript will commendably help in illustrating the core 
concept of artificial intelligence, as well as the technological 
advances, which have been occurred in artificial intelligence. 
In addition to this, the paper will also assist in understanding 
and identifying the statistical models for speech recognition. 
II. SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS  
Speech recognition can be understood as an approach, 
which deals with the translation of spoken words into the text. 
It has been established by [4] that speech recognition can also 
be referred as ASR, as the technique offers to recognize the 
speech automatically. In accordance with the views and 
perceptions of [13], some of the speech recognition systems 
utilize speaker independent speech recognition. On the other 
hand, other speech recognition systems utilize training 
method, in which an indivuial speaker reads sections of text 
into the speech recognition system. It has been established by 
[9] that these speech recognition systems recognize the 
specific voice of a person and use it to modify the recognition 
of person’s speech; hence, resulting in more coherent and 
integrated transcription. It is significant to notice that systems, 
which use training, are referred as “speaker-dependent 
systems”. However, such systems, which do not use training, 
are known as “speaker-independent systems”. It has been 
claimed by [12] that speech recognition can be applied in 
different areas and sectors. Some of the most prominent 
applications of speech recognition include aircrafts (direct 
voice input), speech-to-text processing (emails or work 
processors), formulation of structured documents (radiology 
reports), simple data entry (credit card number entry), smart 
search (podcast), domestic appliance control, call routing, 
voice dialing, etc.  
According to [11], integrated and smooth performance of

speech recognition mainly depends on the utilization of 
appropriate statistical models. It is due to the fact that these 
statistical models convert speech into readable form and vice 
versa [6]. Thereby, the adoption and usage of inappropriate 
statistical model may affect the integrity of speech 
recognition. Proceeding section incorporates the analysis of 
different statistical models, which are being used in speech 
recognition. 
III. STATISTICAL MODELS OF SPEECH RECOGNITION  
A. Acoustic Model (AM)  
One of the most prominent and widely adopted models of 
speech recognition is acoustic model (AM). It has been 
established that acoustic models of speech recognition capture 
the characteristics of the basic recognition units. According to 
[14], the recognition units can be at the phoneme level, 
syllable level, and at the word level. Several inadequacies and 
constraints come into consideration with the selection of each 
of these units. Reference [7] has claimed that for LVCSR 
(large vocabulary continuous speech recognition) systems, 
phoneme is the most favorable unit. Hidden Markov models 
and neural networks (NN) are the widely adopted approaches, 
which are being utilized for the acoustic modeling of speech 
recognition systems.  
B. Language Model (LM)  
Language model is another most significant statistical 
model of speech recognition. One of the major objectives of 
language model is to convey or transmit the behavior of the 
language. It is due to the fact that it intends to forecast the 
existence of the specific word sequences within the target 
speech. According to [6], from the aspect of recognition 
engine, this statistical model of speech recognition assists in 
minimizing the search space for a reliable and credible 
combination of words. It is significant to notice that language 
model was developed by the help of CMU statistical LM 
toolkit.  
C. Lexicon Model  
It has been claimed by [10] that lexicon model provides the 
pronunciation of the words within the target speech, which has 
to be recognized. In accordance with the perceptions of [5], 
the lexicon model plays an inevitable and indispensable role in 
automatic speech recognition. It is due to the fact that the 
operations of lexical model are based on two parameters, i.e., 
whole-word access, and decomposition of entire speech into 
small chunks. This process eventually results in appropriate 
recognition of the speech. For instance, if speech recognition 
models are in native language, the lexicon model has to be 
formulated in the native languages, in order to acquire 
valuable and useful results. In this regard, artificial neutral 
network phoneme can be considered as one of the greatest 
approaches, as it assists in developing the native lexicon from 
the foreign lexicon; hence, resulting in mapping the phone of 
English to the phones of native languages [12]. It is important 
to notice that the entire process is conducted, while 
considering the contextual information.  
D. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) 
Reference [14] has affirmed that hidden Markov model is 
the most popular statistical tool, which is being used for the 
modeling of data. It has been analyzed that hidden Markov 
model has played a commendable role in reducing the issues 
of speech classification, which was one of the core issues, 
within the speech recognition approach. According to [11], 
hidden Markov model incorporated various issues, which used 
to affect the accuracy of speech recognition. In order to 
resolve those issues, subspace projection algorithm and 
weighted hidden Markov models were proposed [8]. 
Afterwards, this model has become the basis of modern 
HMM-based continuous speech recognition technology.  
IV. DISTINCTIVE DECODING METHODS OF SPEECH 
RECOGNITION  
It has been documented in the research, which was carried 
out by [6] that various different techniques of decoding can be 
used, in order to recognize the speech. Some of the most 
prominent and widely used methods include acoustic phonetic 
method, pattern recognition method, and artificial intelligence 
approach [10]. All of these methods are briefly illustrated in 
the proceeding section.  
A. Pattern Recognition  
Pattern recognition is found to be the most common and 
widely adopted techniques of speech recognition. This method 
mainly incorporates two important steps, including pattern 
comparison and pattern training. It has been established from 
the studies of [10] that the leading characteristic of this 
method is that it utilizes a well structured and integrated 
mathematical framework [5]. This mathematical framework 
assists in formulating consistent representations of speech 
patterns; hence result in the acquisition of more accurate 
results. Pattern recognition is further divided into two more 
approaches, i.e., stochastic approach and template approach.  
B. Acoustic Phonetic  
According to [14], the most primitive approaches of speech 
recognition were mainly based on the process of locating 
sounds and speeches. One of the major objectives of such 
activities was to provide adequate labels to the sample sounds, 
in order to recognize the patterns of the sound. It is significant 
to notice that such methods are found to be the foundation of 
the acoustic phonetic approach. As per the notion of acoustic 
phonetic approach, there exist phonemes (phonetic units) and 
finite units within spoken language. These units of acoustic 
phonetic approach are extensively categorized by the 
collection of acoustic properties that are usually evident in the 
speech signal.  
C. Artificial Intelligence  
According to [11], the approach of artificial intelligence is 
the most famous methods of speech recognition, which are 
being used for decoding. Artificial intelligence can be 
understood as the combination of the pattern recognition 
approach and acoustic phonetic approach. It is due to the fact

that it incorporates the concepts and ideas of pattern 
recognition methods and acoustic phonetic approach. It has 
been established that artificial intelligence is also referred as 
knowledge based approach and it utilizes the information, 
which is related to spectrogram, phonetic, and linguistic. 
According to [1], the approach of artificial intelligence plays 
an indispensable role in different activities of speech 
recognition, including designing of recognition algorithm, 
demonstration of speech units, and representation of suitable 
and appropriate inputs. It is significant to bring into the notice 
that, among all methods of speech recognition, artificial 
intelligence is the most credible and efficient methods.  
In general, artificial intelligence can be understood as the 
emerging and continually developing fields of computer 
science. It has been analyzed that artificial intelligence mainly 
emphasizes on the development of such machines, which are 
capable enough to get engage in the behaviors of human 
beings.  
It has been documented in the research, which was carried 
out by [14] that these artificial machines collects information 
from their respective environments and respond in an 
intelligent manner, calculating appropriate and adequate steps, 
formulating answers, and presents desired results. It has been 
recognized from the studies of [2]; [7], that artificial 
intelligence is widely used in different areas, including 
pedestrian signals and traffic lights, robotic household 
equipment, maintenance systems and home security, 
healthcare robotics, credit card transactions, cell phones (smart 
phones), and video games. Besides all of these applications, 
artificial intelligence is extensively used in speech recognition.  
V. APPLICATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN SPEECH 
RECOGNITION  
It has been observed from the evaluation of studies, which 
presented by [3] that artificial intelligence is currently being 
used in different fields of life, including scientific discovery, 
remote sensing, transportation, aviation, law, robot control, 
stock trading, medical diagnosis, and even toys. However, one 
of the most outstanding applications of artificial intelligence is 
speech recognition. Studies of [8]; [12] show that the approach 
of artificial is broadly utilized in answering machines of 
customer care centres and call centres. In this account, [10] 
claims that speech recognition software enable the computers 
to handle first level of natural language processing, text 
mining, and customer support, in order to foster enhanced and 
improved customer handling; hence results in customer 
satisfaction.  
Speech recognition is one of the difficult issues, as it needs 
to have highly integrated and considerate techniques. 
According to [12], in speech recognition, issues are often 
occurred due to the lack of ample vocabulary. In the current 
era, the approach of speech recognition has been used in 
different areas, including automated telephony systems, 
mobile phones, etc. However, the accomplishment of error-
free speech recognition, specifically for continuous speech, 
has remained an unsolved and difficult issue. Recent research, 
which was proposed by [3], shows that different contemporary 
technologies have been developed by the researchers, which 
have made it possible to attain reasonable accuracy of words. 
Precisely, emerging approaches and technological paradigms 
are playing a commendable role in steadily enhancing the 
integrity of speech recognition. On the contrary [7] has 
declared the fact that these technologies are not capable 
enough to compete with the accuracy of human listeners. 
Therefore, it is one of the most challenging tasks for the 
researchers to design and develop flawless and highly efficient 
speech recognition techniques. In such circumstances, the 
approach of artificial intelligence can be considered as one of 
the greatest opportunities, in terms of recognizing the patterns 
of speech, accurately. It is due to the fact that artificial 
intelligence incredibly transforms the speech into well-
structured algorithms, by appropriately following all stages 
[15]. Most important stages, which are involved in speech 
recognition through artificial intelligence includes 
representation of speech units, formulation and development 
of recognition algorithms, as well as demonstration of correct 
inputs (speech). 
VI. TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL 
INTELLIGENCE 
Artificial intelligence has gained tremendous boost in the 
past two decades, as it has been applied in extensive areas and 
fields of life. It has been revealed from the profound analysis 
of the research of [5] that the techniques of artificial 
intelligence have been advocated by several developers and 
researchers. Some of the most common and well-developed 
techniques of artificial intelligence includes data mining, 
fuzzy logic, neural networks, and knowledge based systems. 
One of the major objectives behind this activity was to 
enhance and improve the software development processes, in 
order to compete with today’s fast paced and volatile 
environment. According to [13], some of the most evident 
advancements in artificial intelligence include the 
development of artificial neural network systems, graphical 
user interfaces, object-oriented programming, natural language 
processing, fuzzy logic, rule based expert systems for aviation 
sector, speech recognition, text recognition, robot navigation, 
object recognition, intelligent transportation, as well as 
obstacle avoidance.  
VII. CONCLUSION 
From above discussion, it can be concluded that the 
applications of speech recognition are becoming extensively 
important and useful nowadays. After conducting this 
research, it has been established that speech recognition is the 
process of transforming the input signals (usually speech) into 
the well-structured sequences of words. It is significant to 
notice that these sequences are developed in the form of 
algorithms. Basically, these algorithms converts the speech 
into the words and vice versa; hence results in more coherent, 
accrete, and correct recognition of speech. It has been assessed 
that speech recognition has become one of the greatest 
challenges and several techniques and approaches have been

developed, to overcome this issue. Amid all of those 
paradigms and models, artificial intelligence is considered as 
one of the most reliable and adequate approaches. This 
research study has incorporated the in-depth evaluation of the 
core concept of artificial intelligence. In addition to this, the 
paper has also illustrated the speech recognition systems. 
Besides that different statistical models of speech recognition 
have also been encapsulated in the paper, including acoustic 
model (AM), language model (LM), lexicon model, and 
Hidden Markov models (HMM).  
These statistical models play a major role in designing the 
algorithms and patterns of speech, which has to be recognized. 
Additionally, it has also been analyzed that different decoding 
methods are also used for speech recognition. Some of the 
most common and extensively adopted methods include 
artificial intelligence, acoustic phonetic, and pattern 
recognition. Amid all of these approaches or methods, 
artificial intelligence can be considered as the most integrated 
and effective approaches, as this technique provides highly 
reliable and accurate results. The paper has also demonstrated 
the application of artificial intelligence in speech recognition, 
while assessing the technological advances in the field of 
artificial intelligence.
