Voice Recognition Technology 
 
A touch of the future in the Isle of Man 
 
Hon. Steve Rodan, in Douglas 
 
Speaker of the House of Keys the Hon Steve Rodan SHK explains how voice recognition 
technology is being deployed in the production of the Official Report in the Isle of Man. 
 
 
 
 
Mr Rodan is the Speaker of the 
House of Keys, the Manx 
lower House. A Pharmacist, he 
was first elected to the Keys in 
1995 and elected Speaker in 
2006. 
 
WHEN it was suggested that 
speech recognition technology 
might be able to produce 
“instant” text for the Official 
Report of Tynwald 1, the idea 
seemed as far-fetched as 
something out of a science 
fiction novel. However, after 
two and a half years of hard 
work, science fiction became 
reality in April 2008, when, 
thanks to the vision and 
perseverance of senior Hansard 
editor Ian Faulds, the Isle of 
Man became the first 
Parliament in the 
Commonwealth to enter the 
instant transcription age.  
 
However, as you might expect, 
it is a little more complex than 
that! In simple terms Members’ 
speech is digitally recorded and 
‘converted’, through individual 
voice profiles, into 
continuously scrolling text. 
This is immediately available 
to the Hansard editors at a 
remote location, so they can 
begin the process of ‘tidying 
up’ what Members have said 
within three or four minutes of 
the beginning of a 
parliamentary session. 
 
The immediate benefit of the 
system has been twofold: to 
increase the speed of Hansard 
delivery to Members and the 
wider public, at the same time 
reducing the cost of 
production. For those of us 
interested in connecting 
parliament to people these are 
important considerations. 
 
 
 
The downside 
There is, however, a caveat. 
Whilst the use of our speech 
recognition software has so far 
delivered up to 95% accuracy 
for automatic transcription of 
well spoken English, it has 
done rather less well for heavy 
accents, slurred speech, sore 
throats or lisps. Remarkably, it 
has coped well with Manx 
Gaelic when the relevant words 
have been given English 
phonetics. The fact that the 
resulting automatic 
transcription is not 100% 
accurate means that all 
speeches do need to be edited 
before being published! Even a 
small error, such as omitting 
the word “not”, could be of 
major importance when 
reviewing a debate! 
 
This has led to some light-
hearted moments, particularly 
during the early stages of 
development, when it quickly 
became apparent that editors 
needed to remain alert to what 
was really being said. Did, for 
example, the Member really 
say “a pig of a floating pouch 
penalty”? Not quite.  
Clicking on the audio button 
revealed they had said: “they 
pick up a £40 penalty”!   
 
The software 2, originally 
developed in Australia, relies 
on the use of individual voice 
profiles and these are 
“harvested” – to use a technical 
expression – by asking each 
Member to record a five-
minute pre-prepared passage. 
The resulting “profile” is then 
improved over a period of time 
by using the corrected audio 
from each session to adapt its 
acoustic and language elements 
– in other words, attempting to 
learn the Member’s speech 
patterns and use of language. 
We anticipate that this process 
will take approximately six 
months, but at the end of that 
period of “training”, we expect 
the voice profiles to produce a 
much more accurate 
transcription. Of course, for 
parliaments which sit more 
frequently, the “training” of 
Members’ voice profiles could 
be considerably faster… 
 
Context is an important 
element in speech recognition, 
as the computer does not work 
like the human ear. As part of 
the development process, we 
have created a substantial 
dictionary of Manx 
parliamentary phrases and 
expressions. In addition, as a 
matter of routine, we now input 
material from Order and 
Question Papers prior to 
debates taking place. All of this 
helps to create the framework 
of words within which the 
speech recognition engine can 
successfully navigate. 
 
 
 
The upside 
Although single user speech 
recognition has been available 
for many years, what is new 
about the Tynwald system is 
that it has successfully adapted 
the technology to include an 
infinite number of speakers on 
one audio channel. Each 
speaker has a separate 
microphone, and as he or she 
stands up to speak, the 
chamber editor uses a touch 
screen to switch in the correct 
voice profile, creating an 
“utterance” which is then 
automatically transcribed. 
 
Meanwhile, back in their 
offices, the other four full-time 
editors are already hard at 
work, correcting the text as it 
appears on their screens. 
Working consecutively, each 
editor takes an “utterance” and 
checks it against the audio, 
which can be played and 
replayed until he or she is 
satisfied with the result. From 
taking an average of five or six 
days to process and publish, we 
published our first same day 
Hansard on 15 April 2008 and 
now routinely achieve 
electronic publication within 
one or two days.  
 
Clearly, this has been a 
friendly revolution for the 
Office of the Official Report, 
all of whose staff are fully 
committed to improving their 
service to Members and the 
public. On a broader front, 
however, there has been a 
gradual but significant decrease 
in the number of self-employed 
home-workers who have, 
traditionally, provided the 
backbone of the parliamentary 
transcription service. From a 
peak of 20 home transcribers in 
2007, we expect to retain no 
more than 5 after completion of 
the transition to speech 
recognition in all three 
Chambers.  
 
The effect of these changes has 
already been felt, with 
transcription costs for the short 
summer sitting of Tynwald 
alone falling by more than 
£7,000. Once speech 
recognition has been 
introduced into the House of 
Keys3 and the Legislative 
Council4, annual savings are 
expected to exceed the total 
cost of the specialist software 
and associated hardware. 
 
Although working with the 
new software has made 
considerable demands on Mr 
Faulds and his editing team, 
who now work voluntary late 
nights and sometimes sit at 
their screens almost non-stop 
for up to a week, the end result 
has been well worthwhile – 
particularly as the team feels it 
has touched the future! After 
all, the concept of producing 
Hansard throughout the 
Commonwealth can never be 
quite the same again.
