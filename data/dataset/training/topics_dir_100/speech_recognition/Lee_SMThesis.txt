Abstract
A closed-loop auditory based speech feature extraction algorithm is presented to address
the problem of unseen noise for robust speech recognition. This closed-loop model is in-
spired by the possible role of the medial olivocochlear (MOC) efferent system of the human
auditory periphery, which has been suggested in [?, ?, ?] to be important for human speech
intelligibility in noisy environment. We propose that instead of using a fixed filter bank, the
filters used in a feature extraction algorithm should be more flexible to adapt dynamically
to different types of background noise. Therefore, in the closed-loop model, a feedback
mechanism is designed to regulate the operating points of filters in the filter bank based on
the background noise. The model is tested on a dataset created from TIDigits database. In
this dataset, five kinds of noise are added to synthesize noisy speech. Compared with the
standard MFCC extraction algorithm, the proposed closed-loop form of feature extraction
algorithm provides 9.7%, 9.1% and 11.4% absolute word error rate reduction on average
for three kinds of filter banks respectively.

Introduction
1.1 Overview of the Problem
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are usually vulnerable to noise, which has
made robust speech recognition a very challenging problem. Speech recognition accuracy
rates can degrade substantially due to the influence of noise because noise can contam-
inate speech signals so severely that informative speech features can be masked. More
specifically, the acoustic model in a speech recognition system is usually trained on feature
vectors extracted from speech signals, either noisy or clean, and the acoustic model then re-
flects the distribution of the feature vectors which represent different acoustic units. When
speech signals are contaminated by noise that is not seen during training, the feature repre-
sentations for each acoustic unit can be significantly altered by the noise, which results in a
distribution that is far different from the one generated by the training data. Consequently,
the speech recognition performance will mostly deteriorate as a consequence.
Noise-robust features are therefore critical to all ASR systems which operate in adverse
environments. Many efforts have examined the field of robust speech recognition, and
two major approaches have been used to improve recognition performance. One approach
is feature normalization; methods like cepstral mean normalization (CMN) [?], cepstral
mean variance normalization (CMVN) [?], and mean variance ARMA [?] are well studied
and have shown promising results. Alternatively, numerous feature extraction algorithms
have been proposed to provide noise-robust features. Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
13
(MFCCs), an auditory based speech feature representation, are widely used in many ASR
systems for their reasonable noise robustness [?]. Perceptual linear prediction (PLP) [?],
another popular feature, is also a technique for speech analysis that uses psycho-acoustic
concepts to estimate an auditory spectrum.
Even though much progress has been made in this area, there is still room for improve-
ment. Therefore, one of the goals of this thesis is to contribute solutions to the challenge of
robust speech recognition, particularly, for the problem of unseen noise.
1.2 Overview of Proposed Approach
This thesis attempts to solve the problem of degraded recognition performances caused by
mismatched noises contained in training and test data. This thesis approaches the problem
by developing a feature extraction algorithm, which is designed to be capable of generating
consistent speech representations, no matter what kind of noise is contained in the speech
signals, and, in turn, to reduce the effect made by the unseen noise on recognition perfor-
mance of ASR systems. The motivation of this feature extraction algorithm design and the
goal of this thesis are described in more detail in the following sections.
1.3 Motivation of Proposed Approach
In noisy environments, human performance in speech recognition degrades much more
gracefully than the performance of machines [?]. This seems to indicate that current fea-
ture extraction algorithms have not exploited all the advantages of the human auditory
system, which appears to be more resilient to all kinds of noise. In our research; therefore,
we explore auditory-inspired feature extraction, as we believe this approach remains only
partially understood and has much potential for development.
Recent speech intelligibility research [?, ?, ?] has examined the role of auditory feed-
back mechanisms of the human auditory system in perceiving speech signals. The results
have suggested that the feedback mechanism may help increase the robustness of speech
features. Particularly, [?, ?, ?] introduced the concept of closed-loop cochlear model.The
14
multi-band path non-linear (MBPNL) model, which was inspired by the medial olivo-
cochlear (MOC) efferents in the auditory periphery. The model was shown to have po-
tential for speech discrimination in noise and was capable of matching human confusions
in stationary noise.
Most feature extraction algorithms contain a cochlea-like module as a subroutine, for
example, the MFCC extraction procedure contains a filter bank which consists of an array
of overlapping triangle windows equally spaced on the Mel scale. These modules are used
to approximate human auditory response and to model human cochlea. However, these
filter banks always remain static during the entire feature extraction procedure, which is
against the observations in the human cochlea. The human cochlea changes its operating
points dynamically according to the information sent from the efferent feedback system,
which depends on the background noise [?].
Motivated by this evidence we decided to apply the concept of the feedback mechanism,
observed in the human auditory periphery system, to a standard speech feature extraction
procedure to form a closed-loop auditory-based feature extraction algorithm. This proposed
feature extraction algorithm mimics the behavior of the human cochlea and allows the filter
bank, which is usually included in a standard speech representation extraction procedure,
to adjust its operating point according to the intensity of the background noise. With the
ability to adapt to the background environment, the proposed feature extraction algorithm
is capable of generating consistent speech features for speech signals embedded in different
kinds of noises.
1.4 Goals of the Thesis
This thesis aims at the following two main goals: Developing a closed-loop auditory-based
feature extraction algorithm for robust speech recognition and examining the potential use
of the MBPNL model for robust speech recognition.
15
1.4.1 Developing a Closed-loop Auditory-based Feature Extraction Al-
gorithm for Robust Speech Recognition
First, we apply the concept of efferent feedback mechanism introduced in [?, ?, ?] to de-
velop a closed-loop feature extraction algorithm, using each of the three filter banks, a
Mel-scale frequency filter bank, a gammatone filter bank and an MBPNL filter bank, as a
cochlear model. Based on observations of the human auditory system, we design a pro-
cedure, which determines the operating point of the cochlear model to allow the cochlear
model to adapt dynamically to the background noise. In order to show that the feedback
mechanism can improve robustness and address the problem of unseen noise in training
data, we specify the experimental environment based on the TIDigits [?] database and test
the proposed algorithm on the database.
1.4.2 Examining the Potential Use of the MBPNL Model for Robust
Speech Recognition
In [?, ?, ?], the MBPNL model [?] was included in a speech information extraction pro-
cedure for diagnostic rhyme tests (DRTs), and it has shown that the ability of the MBPNL
model to more precisely model the human cochlea enhances speech intelligibility. The
MBPNL model has not been integrated into any feature extraction procedures for continu-
ous speech recognition tasks. In this thesis, we want to not only include the MBPNL model
into the proposed feature extraction algorithm, but also analyze the model systematically
to demonstrate its potential use in robust speech recognition.
1.5 Overview of the Thesis
This thesis starts with an overview of the problem that we aim to contribute to, and we
describe the proposed solution in this thesis in brevity. Following the overview of the
proposed method, the motivation of the method and the goals of this thesis are presented.
The rest of the thesis discusses how we approach the problem and how we achieve the goals
of the thesis in more detail.
16
Chapter 2: Related Work
The proposed feature extraction algorithm is based on observations of the human auditory
system. In order to establish an understanding of the design logic behind the proposed
method, several components of the human auditory periphery that are related to the feature
extraction algorithm are described. Also, a review of the state of the art in the field of robust
speech recognition is discussed.
Chapter 3: The Closed-loop Feature Extraction Algorithm
The framework of the closed-loop feature extraction algorithm is presented, and each of
the components contained in the algorithm is discussed in detail. More importantly, we
describe how to integrate the efferent feedback system into the feature extraction procedure
and how we determine the operating point of the filter bank included in the algorithm.
Chapter 4: Linear Filter Bank
Two linear filter banks, the gammatone filter bank and the Mel-scale frequency filter bank,
are applied to the feature extraction procedure. We describe the two filter banks in detail
and show how to integrate the two filter banks into the proposed closed-loop algorithm. We
also visualize the difference between features extracted by algorithms with and without the
efferent feedback system.
Chapter 5: Multi-Band Path Non-Linear Model
The MBPNL model is introduced to the speech feature extraction procedure designed in
this thesis for a continuous speech recognition task. We analyze the MBPNL model care-
fully and show its ability to increase the instantaneous SNRs of a weak signal, which has
potentially beneficial application for robust speech recognition. We also explain how to
combine the MBPNL model with the feedback mechanism to form a closed-loop auditory-
based feature extraction algorithm.
17
Chapter 6: Experiment Setup and Results
In order to test the proposed method, a data set is created based on the TIDigits database.
Noises used in the Aurora2 [?] database as well as three common noises are applied to
create noisy speech signals for this data set. Experiment results for all the models discussed
in this thesis are presented and analyzed in detail.
Chapter 7: Conclusions and Potential Work
We summarize the contributions of this thesis, examine the goals we set for this thesis and
suggest potential research directions.

Chapter 2
Background
The feature extraction algorithm design of this thesis is based on the human auditory pe-
riphery. In order to establish a good understanding of the design logic behind the proposed
feature extraction procedure, a brief description of mammalian periphery auditory system
is presented in this chapter. A review of the state of the art in robust speech recognition is
discussed in this chapter as well.
2.1 The Human Peripheral Auditory System
The outer part of the human periphery auditory system consists of three parts; namely, the
outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The feature extraction algorithm proposed in
this thesis focuses on modeling behaviors of the inner ear and the olivocochlear efferent
system, originated in the superior olivary complex. Particularly, the components of the
inner ear that are related to this thesis work are the cochlea, the outer and inner hair cells
and the medial olivocochlear bundle. Each of the components is described in the following
sections. (Most descriptions of the models of the inner ear are cited from [?].)
2.1.1 The Cochlea
The cochlea is a fluid filled chamber inside the ear surrounded by bony rigid walls. The
length of the cochlea is roughly 35 mm in humans and it is coiled up like a snail shell
19
around the 8th cranial nerve. It is divided along its length by two membranes, Reissnerâs
membrane and the basilar membrane, and contains two types of hair cells, inner hair cells
and outer hair cells.
When sound waves travel through the fluid compartment of the cochlea, they cause
motion on the basilar membrane. The part of the cochlea near the oval window is referred
to as the base or basal end and the part farthest from the oval window is the apex or apical
end. The base of the basilar membrane is relatively narrow and stiff while the apex is wider
and much less stiff. As a result, high frequency sounds produce a maximum displacement
of the basilar membrane near the basal end which decays abruptly. Low frequency sounds
produce a maximum displacement closer to the apical end of the membrane [?]. Hence the
basilar membrane can be thought of a tonotopically organized hydromechanical frequency
analyzer, and can be modeled as a bank of overlapping band-pass filters.
The inner ear behaves nonlinearly. The basilar membrane vibration response does not
grow proportionally to the magnitude of the input [?, ?, ?]. Instead, as the level of a
sound input decreases, the basilar membrane vibration gain function becomes increasingly
sharper. The gain increases in the vicinity of the characteristic frequency (CF), and is
independent of level for frequencies less than an octave below the CF. Hence the response
reflects a band-limited nonlinearity around the CF [?]. In sum, the gain is greatest for
stimuli near threshold and gradually decreases with larger inputs, which exhibits a level
dependence.
2.1.2 The Inner Hair Cells
As stated in Section 2.1.1, there are two populations of hair cells, inner hair cells (IHCs)
and outer hair cells (OHCs). These cells have flat apical surfaces that are crowned with
ciliary, or sensory hair, bundles that are typically arranged in a W, V, or U shape.
Innervating the hair cells are two types of neurons: afferent neurons and efferent neu-
rons. Afferent neurons carry information from the cochlea to higher levels of the auditory
system. The great majority of afferent neurons, 90-95% of the total population [?], connect
to inner hair cells, and each inner hair cell is contacted by about 20 neurons [?]. Hence it is
20
believed that most, if not all, of the information about sounds is conveyed via the inner hair
cells. Direct measurements of the cochlear afferent fibers that innervate the IHCs in mam-
mals [?, ?], have shown a phenomenon known as phase-locking: in response to a pure tone,
the nerve firings tend to be phase locked or synchronized to the stimulating waveform. A
given nerve fiber does not necessarily fire on every cycle of the stimulus but, when firings
do occur, they occur at roughly the same phase of the waveform each time. It has been
shown [?] that phase-locking begins to decline at about 600 Hz and is no longer detectable
above 3.5-5 kHz. It is suggested that the cause of this decline is the low-pass filtering of the
a.c. component by the hair-cell membrane [?]. Both efferent and afferent nerves exhibit a
spontaneous firing rate and also a saturation firing rate; no matter how stimulated a nerve
becomes, it can not fire faster than the saturation rate.
Efferent neurons have spikes that travel towards the cochlea, and thus carry information
from the higher levels of the auditory system, specifically the superior olivary complex,
back to the cochlea. Lateral olivocochlear efferents terminate on the afferent dendrites
coming from the IHCs. Medial olivocochlear efferents terminate in granulated endings that
dominate the neural pole of the OHCs. More discussion on the role of the MOC efferents
is included in the next section.
2.1.3 The Medial Olivocochlea Efferents
Detailed morphological and neurophysiological description of the medial olivocochlear
(MOC) efferent feedback system is provided in [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]. MOC efferents originate
from neurons that are medial, ventral or anterior to the medial superior olivary nucleus, have
myelinated axons, and terminate directly on OHCs. Medial efferents project predominantly
to the contralateral cochlea with the crossed innervation biased toward the base compared to
the uncrossed innervation [?]. Roughly two-thirds of medial efferents respond to ipslateral
sound, i.e. one-third to contralateral sound, and a small fraction to sound in either ear.
Medial efferents have tuning curves that are similar to, or slightly wider than, those of
auditory nerve fibers, and they project to different places along the cochlear partition in a
tonotopical manner. Finally, medial efferents have longer latencies and group delays than
21
auditory nerve fibers.
Current understanding of the functional role of the MOC efferent feedback mechanism
is incomplete. However, one speculated role, which is of particular interest for this thesis,
is a dynamic regulation of the cochlear operating point depending on background acous-
tic stimulation, resulting in robust human performance in perceiving speech in a noisy
background [?]. Several neurophysiological studies support this role. Using anesthetized
cats with noisy acoustic stimuli, [?] showed that by stimulating the MOC nerve bundle
electrically, the dynamic range of discharge rate at the auditory nerve is partly recovered.
Measuring neural responses of awake cats to noisy acoustic stimuli, [?] showed that the
dynamic range of discharge rate at the auditory nerve level is only moderately affected by
changes in levels of background noise. Both studies indicate that MOC efferent stimulation
plays a role of regulating the auditory nerve fiber response in the presence of noise.
2.1.4 Links to Thesis Work
Based on physiological data in support of the role of MOC efferents in dynamically regulat-
ing the operating point of cochlea and, in turn, enhancing signal properties at the auditory
nerve level, particularly when the signal is contaminated by noise, a closed-loop speech
feature extraction algorithm is developed in this thesis. The goal of the closed-loop algo-
rithm is to model the effect of MOC efferents on the mechanical properties of the cochlea
by computing feedback information and adjusting the cochlea model accordingly. Based
on the observation that the human cochlea reacts nonlinearly to signal levels, a nonlinear
filter, multi-band path nonlinear (MBPNL) model, is integrated in the speech feature extrac-
tion algorithm for the purpose of modeling human cochlea more precisely. The proposed
closed-loop algorithm is described in Chapter 3, and the MBPNL model is introduced in
more detail in Chapter ??.
2.2 Related Work
This section presents the research literature related to this thesis work. It starts with re-
search that inspired the development of the closed-loop speech representation algorithm,
22
and it discusses auditory-based feature extraction algorithms, nonlinear filter bank designs,
and finally, other non-auditory based approaches for robust speech recognition.
2.2.1 Closed-loop Auditory Model
A closed-loop auditory speech processing model has been proposed in [?], which explores
the role of the medial olivocochlear efferent pathway in the human auditory periphery. The
MOC component provides feedback from the brain stem to the peripheral auditory system,
which is modeled by a closed-loop feedback mechanism in the model. The advantage of
the feedback mechanism proved to be in adjusting the gain and the bandwidth of the filters
in the filter bank to different kinds of noise levels, which is promising for producing robust
speech representations.
The model was tested on speech signals containing three different levels of additive
speech-shaped noise, and the recognition task was an energy-based template-matching and
time-aligned Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT). Specifically, the recognition was mostly done
on a synthetic database which was composed of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) words,
where the initial consonant to vowel transition region for each word was time aligned to
200 ms and DRT word pairs were synthesized so that the formantsâ final target values of
the vowel in a given word pair were identical past 400 ms into the file, restricting stimulus
differences to the initial diphones. Noise was added to each word to obtain test tokens at
various presentation levels and SNR: 70 dB, 60 dB and 50 dB SPL and 10 dB, 5 dB, 0 dB
SNR.
There are two DRT template matching operations: two template comparisons and multi-
ple template tokens. In the DRT template matching operation of two template comparisons,
the DRT task was accomplished by having the computer compute the mean-square-error
(MSE) distance between the presented diphone and the two possible diphone templates,
corresponding to each possible diphone in the test pair. Templates were selected from a
single SPL and SNR condition and used for each MSE computation. The test stimuli were
the same diphone tokens in different noise intensity levels and different values of SNR.
For a given test token, the template with the smaller MSE distance from the test token was
23
selected as the simulated DRT response of the computer. For the case of multiple template
tokens, the MSE distance metric was computed for each template condition. The final tem-
plate token was selected by picking the template resulting in the smallest distance to the
test tokens.
The results show that the model is able to mimic human performance in the consonant
discrimination task, and the best performance of the system exceeded that of humans on the
presentational levels and SNRs evaluated. Based on these results, a closed-loop auditory-
based speech representation algorithm is proposed in this thesis. However, instead of using
only one type of noise, multiple kinds of noises, both stationary and non-stationary are
tested in the thesis. In addition, the recognition task done in this thesis is an HMM-based
continuous digit recognition task rather than a time-aligned template matching task. Over-
all, the problem to be solved in this thesis is more difficult and challenging.
2.2.2 General Auditory Models
Much effort also has been put in seeking signal processing techniques motivated by hu-
man auditory physiology and perception. A number of signal processing schemes have
been designed to mimic various aspects of the human auditory system. For example, in
[?], an auditory model that simulates, in considerable detail, the outer parts of the audi-
tory periphery up through the auditory nerve level is described. The model consists of 190
cochlear channels, distributed from 200 Hz to 7 kHz, according to the frequency-position
relation suggested by [?]. Each channel comprises Goldsteinâs nonlinear model of the hu-
man cochlea [?], followed by an array of five level-crossing detectors that simulate the
auditory nerve fibers innervating on inner hair cells. The simulated auditory nerve firing
patterns are processed, according to observed properties of actual auditory nerve response,
to form speech representations. The representation used in [?] is ensemble interval his-
togram (EIH), which is a measure of the spatial extent of coherent activity across the simu-
lated auditory nerve. The performance of this model was tested on a DRT suggested by [?],
and it concluded that the performance was improved by replacing a conventional speech
representation by the auditory model, but was still short of achieving human performance.
24
A variant of the EIH model was proposed in [?]. The proposed zero-crossings with
peak amplitudes (ZCPA) model is composed of cochlear band-pass filters and a nonlin-
ear stage at the output of each band-pass filter. The bank of band-pass filters simulates
frequency selectivity of the basilar membrane in the cochlea, and the nonlinear stage mod-
els the auditory nerve fibers, which fire in synchrony with the stimulation. The nonlinear
stage consists of a zero-crossing detector, a peak detector, and a compressive nonlinearity.
Frequency information is obtained by the zero-crossing detector, and intensity information
is also incorporated by the peak detector followed by the compressive nonlinearity. It is
shown analytically that the variance of the level-crossing interval perturbation increases
as the level value increases in the presence of additive noise. Thus, the zero-crossing is
more robust to noise than the level-crossing, and it offers the motivation for utilizing zero-
crossings for robust speech recognition in noisy environments. The zero-crossing with
peak amplitudes model is computationally efficient and free from many unknown param-
eters compared with other auditory models. Experimental comparisons showed that the
ZCPA method demonstrated greatly improved robustness especially in noisy environments
corrupted by white Gaussian noise. In this thesis, zero-crossing rate information is not
utilized; therefore, it could be interesting to incorporate zero-crossing information into the
closed-loop algorithm and see whether the combined model can generate even more robust
speech representations.
Other examples of auditory-based speech representations, including the standard MFCC
feature extraction algorithm [?], and the gammatone filter bank based feature extraction
procedure [?], usually contain a high-pass filter which represents the middle ear in human
auditory system, and a filter bank which mimics the frequency selectivity phenomena in
the human cochlear. In this thesis the mel-scale frequency filter bank and the gammatone
filter bank are both applied to the closed-loop model and their performances are analyzed.
The nonlinear auditory model used in this thesis for the purpose of modeling the hu-
man cochlea more precisely is the multi-band path nonlinear (MBPNL) model designed
by Goldstein [?]. The MBPNL model represents and generalizes measurements of basilar-
membrane mechanical responses in terms of a rapid nonlinear mixing at each place of an
insensitive, linear-like low-pass filter with a sensitive, compressive band-pass filter. The
25
dual filters are associated with the tails and tips of cochlear frequency tuning curves. The
MBPNL model is utilized in the thesis because [?, ?] have shown promising experimental
results using the MBPNL model in their feature extraction methods.
Another example of nonlinear filter bank design for mimicking the human cochlea is
shown in [?]. This research produces a functional model of the auditory nerve response of
the guinea-pig that reproduces a wide range of important responses to auditory stimulation.
A dual-resonance nonlinear filter architecture is used to reproduce the mechanical tuning
of the cochlea.
Another nonlinear cochlea filter bank is presented in [?]. In that article, the authors
point out that some cochlear filter banks are nonlinear but are fitted to animal basilar mem-
brane responses. Others, like the gammatone, are based on human psychophysical data,
but are linear. A human nonlinear filter bank is constructed by adapting a computational
model of animal basilar membrane physiology to simulate human basilar membrane non-
linearity as measured by psychophysical pulsation-threshold experiments. The approach is
based on a dual-resonance nonlinear type of filter whose basic structure was modeled using
animal observations. The filter is fitted at a discrete number of best frequencies for which
psychophysical data are available for a single listener, and for an average response of six
listeners. The filter bank is then created by linear regression of the resulting parameters to
intermediate best frequencies.
2.2.3 Feature Normalization Algorithms
Numerous studies have addressed feature normalization for robust speech recognition.
Methods such as cepstral mean normalization (CMN) [?] and cepstral mean variance nor-
malization (CMVN) [?] aim at removing the speech signal variation caused by the varying
characteristics of transmission channels. The normalization algorithm can be easily imple-
mented in any speech recognition system and the recognition performance can be improved
by normalizing the speech representation with these methods.
More advanced feature normalization techniques include histogram equalization (HEQ)
[?] and mean subtraction, variance normalization, and auto-regression moving-average fil-
26
tering (MVA) [?]. HEQ proposes generalizing the normalization by transforming the fea-
ture vector probability density function to a reference probability density function for each
component of the feature vectors representing the speech signal. Such transformations
can compensate for the distortion the noise produces over the different components of the
feature vector. The MVA approach integrates CMN, CMVN and time sequence filtering
into a post-processing technique; specifically, it applies an auto-regression moving-average
(ARMA) filter in the cepstral domain. Both HEQ and MVA produce promising robust
speech recognition performance for low SNR speech signals. Also, both techniques have
been applied to the Aurora2 [?] database and tested on unseen noises. The MVA post-
processing algorithm has shown to achieve an error rate reduction of 65% on mismatched
tasks. However, both of the approaches require off-line computation; on the contrary, the
proposed closed-loop feature in this thesis is capable of normalizing speech signals on the
fly.

Chapter 3
The Closed-loop Feedback Model
Since the MOC feedback mechanism in the human auditory periphery system has shown
promising potential in speech intelligibility, we would like to explore ways to integrate the
feedback mechanism into a feature extraction algorithm for robust speech recognition. We
call the procedure with feedback closed-loop feature extraction. In this chapter, we briefly
review the MOC feedback mechanism of the auditory periphery, and we will describe the
structure of the closed-loop algorithm, and show how to apply the concept to the standard
feature extraction procedure, and how this closed-loop model reduces the effects of noise.
3.1 Feedback in the Human Auditory System
Previous papers [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] have suggested that the MOC efferent feedback system
may play an important role in robustness of the human auditory periphery in the presence
of background noise. Under noisy conditions, the MOC efferent system sends feedback
signals that depend on the background noise to the cochlea, which accordingly regulates
its operating points in all critical bands. This regulation also affects the inner hair cell
(IHC) response in the presence of noise. The feedback mechanism seems to enable the
human auditory system to generate a more consistent speech representation under various
noise conditions. Even though we still do not have a complete, clear picture of the way
the MOC works to enhance robustness, studies e.g. [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?] consistently show
that the feedback in the MOC may be the key to robust performance of the human auditory
29
system, and we are motivated to apply this concept to create a closed-loop feature extraction
algorithm for speech recognition.
3.2 Closed-loop Feature Extraction Overview
We construct a closed-loop feature extraction algorithm by including a feedback mecha-
nism in the loop. The structure of the closed-loop model is shown in Figure ??. The upper
path of the figure consists of several auditory-based components and reflects partially how
the human auditory periphery works. First, the filter bank models the processing of the
human cochlea, and an inner hair cell module (IHC) is included to mimic the behavior of
the human IHC. The IHC module is then followed by a dynamic range window (DRW),
which corresponds to the observation of the instantaneous rates of firing auditory nerves.
We then smooth the output signals of the DRW module to capture temporal information,
which is sent to a nonlinearity transformer. Finally, we perform a discrete cosine trans-
form to convert signals to a final speech representation that will be passed to the automatic
speech recognizer (ASR). The lower path computes the energy of the speech signal. The
outputs of the upper path and the lower path in the model are combined together to form
the final representation, r(i), for ASR. We explain each component in the model in more
detail and then focus on the feedback mechanism in following sections.
3.3 Filter bank
The purpose of the filter bank is to model the processing of cochlea; in general, all auditory-
based filter banks which model the human cochlea could be used as an filter bank module
in the closed-loop algorithm. In this thesis, we begin by applying the feedback concept to
the Mel-scale frequency filter bank and create a closed-loop model to extract new features,
and then we extend the framework to use a linear gammatone filter bank, and the multi-
band path non-linear (MBPNL) filter bank as the cochlear model in the feature extraction
procedure. Each of these filter banks will be described in more detail in the next two
chapters.

Figure 3-1: The closed-loop model for feature extraction. Note that the filter bank module
could be replaced by any auditory-based filter banks. The upper path consists of several
auditory-based components and reflects partially how human auditory periphery works.
The filter bank models the processing of human cochlea, and an inner hair cell module
(IHC) is included to mimic the behavior of human IHC. The IHC module is followed by a
dynamic range window (DRW), which corresponds to the observation of the instantaneous
rates of auditory nerves. The output signals of the DRW module are smoothed to capture
the temporal information, which is sent to a nonlinearity transformer. The discrete cosine
transform is applied to convert signals to speech representations. The lower path computes
the energy of speech signals. The outputs of the upper path and the lower path in the model
are combined together to form the final representation for speech signals.
One thing that should be pointed out is that instead of using an FFT-based power spec-
trum analysis, we use bandpasss filters to implement the auditory filter bank in the closed-
loop model. Therefore, we filter an entire utterance through the filter bank, so that the input
signal is transformed into an array of output signals indicated by the multiple parallel lines
connecting blocks in Figure ??, each representing an individual signal within the corre-
sponding frequency band. In order to distinguish the FFT-based approach and the bandpass
filter-based approach, for the rest of the thesis, we refer to the FFT-based extraction algo-
rithm as FFT-based baseline (FFT baseline) and the one implemented with real filters as
the filter bank baseline (FB baseline).
3.4 Inner Hair Cell Module
After the filter bank, the signals are sent into an IHC model, which is composed of a
half-wave rectifier and a Johnson lowpass filter with poles at 600 Hz and 3000 Hz [?, ?,
?]. The half-wave rectifier transforms input waveforms of a cochlear channel into a nerve
31
firing response. According to [?], as the center frequency of a cochlear filter increases,
the bandwidth of the cochlear filter increases and information on the fine structure of the
waveform is lost. The phenomenon is modeled by a Johnson filter in the IHC module. A
more concrete example of how the IHC module works is illustrated in figures ?? and ??.
The input signal is a vowel filtered by a gammatone filter centered at 1 kHz. We can see the
effect of passing the signal through the half-wave rectifier in the IHC module from Figure
?? and also loss of the fine structure in the signal after the signal goes through the Johnson
lowpass filter in Figure ??. All of the designs are based on observations of the human
auditory periphery.

the effect of passing the signal through the half-wave rectifier.
3.5 Dynamic Range Window
The IHC module is followed by the DRW module. The DRW is motivated by the dynamic
range observed in the firing rates of auditory nerves; therefore, the DRW is modeled as
a hard limiter with a lower and an upper bound, representing spontaneous and saturation
firing rate, respectively. Specifically, the relation of the input and the output signal values

can be described by the following function, where LB represents the lower bound of the
DRW module and UB represents the upper bound of the DRW module. The DRW module
is depicted in Figure ??. Figure ?? illustrates how the DRW module works by showing

3.6 Smoothing
In order to extract the temporal information of signals, the DRW output signal is analyzed
on a frame-by-frame basis. In our implementation, the length of each frame is 25 ms long,
and the analysis rate is 10 ms per frame. Including 25 ms of information in one frame

is a standard approach for speech recognition; however, according to [?], the length of
each frame has great influence on the performance of its back-end system, i.e. the ASR.
Therefore, we suggest further investigations on the influence of the length of each frame
34
on the recognition performance as potential future work.
In each frame, we sum the absolute value of the signal and calculate the logarithmic
value of the sum to simulate the nonlinear response of the basilar membrane. When sum-
ming up the absolute value of signals within one frame, we apply the window shown in
Figure ?? to each frame [?]. The window has two 3 ms cosine square ramps at both ends
and 19 ms flat region between the ends of the window. The d-dimensional vectors become
the input to the discrete cosine transform (DCT) component, where d is the number of
filters in the filter bank.

Figure 3-6: The 25 ms window has two 3 ms cosine square ramps at its two ends and a 19
ms flat region between the two ends. When signals are segmented into overlapping frames,
the window is applied to the signals to compute the sum of the absolute value of signals
within each frame.
3.7 Discrete Cosine Transform
The DCT module is used to reduce the dimensionality of vectors generated by passing
signals through all previous modules. More specifically, in our experiment setup, the DCT
module transforms each of the d-dimension vectors into a 13-dimension vector, where d
is the number of filters in the filter bank used in the feature extraction procedure. Even
35
though the DCT is widely used in standard speech feature extraction algorithms such as
MFCCs, whether or not the DCT module is suitable for the closed-loop feature extraction
algorithm is still questionable. More discussions on this issue will be presented in Chapter
??. Finally, the log frame energy (lower path of the model in Figure ?? ) along with the
13-dimension vector for each frame form the speech feature generated by the closed-loop
model.
3.8 The Feedback Mechanism
Two major differences between the closed-loop model and an open-loop procedure can be
distinguished: namely, the dynamic range window (DRW) and the gain control. In fact, the
DRW and the gain controller in Figure ?? work together to form the feedback mechanism.
We now focus on explaining how the lower bound of the DRW and the gain profile are
determined.
3.8.1 Dynamic Range Window
As mentioned in Section ??, the lower bound of the DRW module represents the spon-
taneous firing rate of the auditory nerve. Therefore, we first analyze the response of the
open-loop model to some background noises and treat the responses of the IHC module
as the spontaneous firing rate of the auditory nerves. We then decide an appropriate lower
bound for the DRW based on the observations. Specifically, in order to set the lower bound
of the DRW, we pass pure noises of different levels through the open-loop model. These
pure noise signals are theoretically easy to collect for real-world ASR systems, since we
can keep the recognizer continuously listening in the background. We calculate the average
energy level of the noise signals at the output of the IHC module, and we then set the lower
DRW bound of all channels to one parameter, which is larger than the average energy level
of the noise signals for all channels. This constant represents the spontaneous firing rate
of auditory nerves. Once determined, the DRW lower bounds remain fixed. Examples of
energy distribution of different noises and the setup of the lower bound of DRW are shown
in Figure ??.

train and subway. The closed-model has a Mel-scale frequency filter bank. The lower
bound of the DRW that was set for this case is indicated by the magenta line in the figure.
3.8.2 Gain Controller
In contrast to the fixed DRW lower bound, the gain per frequency channel is slowly chang-
ing, following long-term changes in the noise spectral distribution. To estimate the gain
profile we assume a long enough time-window that is signal free (i.e. which contains only
noise) which can be estimated from background noise. We pass the noise signal through
the open-loop model with the DRW lower bound fixed, and adjust the gain until the level
of the average noise energy at the output above the lower bound of DRW is of a prescribed
value. More specifically, suppose Gi is the gain for the ith filter in the filter bank, and XGi
is the noise energy we observe at the output of the ith channel after the filter is multiplied
with Gi. Let the lower bound of DRW be Y . Then we select Gâi , the gain for the i
th filter
in the gain profile, to be the value that satisfies the following equation:
Gâi = arg
Gi
|XGi â Y | <  (dB) (3.2)
In order to make the concept more clear, an example of gain profiles for each of the
37
noise types shown in Figure ?? tuned according to the pre-set DRW lower bound is shown
in Figure ??. The filter bank used in this example is the Mel-scale frequency filter bank. As
shown in the example, the larger the average energy of one channels, the smaller the gain
for that channel is.

Figure 3-8: Examples of the gain profile for different noise signals under the closed-loop
model with a Mel-scale frequency filter bank. The five gain profiles are for the five noise
signals whose energy distribution across all frequencies are shown in Figure ??. Notice
that the higher the sound pressure level of the noise at a given frequency, the smaller the
values of its gain profile are.
After the lower bound of the DRW is set and the gain profile found, the feedback mech-
anism is formed, and we can generate speech representations for each utterance with the
closed-loop model.
In summary, the combination of the gain controller and the DRW lower bound forms
the feedback mechanism for our auditory model. This feedback mechanism ensures the
energy level of noise contained at the output of the DRW is within a prescribed value,
independent of noise type. With this function inherited in it, the closed-loop model can
generate a more consistent representation of the speech signal, embedded in the noise, even
if the background noise varies. More visual comparisons between closed-loop and open-
38
loop model generated speech representations will be shown in the following two chapters,
where we will describe the filter banks used in this thesis in more detail.

Chapter 4
Linear Filter Bank
As Chapter 3 points out, we can incorporate any design of auditory filters in the closed-
loop filter bank module. In this chapter, we explore properties of two linear filter banks, the
gammatone filter bank and the Mel-scale frequency filter bank, and inter grate these two
linear filter banks into the closed-loop algorithm as the role of human cochlea. Further, we
also plot spectrograms generated by these two filter banks in both open-loop and close-loop
cases to see how effective the closed-loop algorithm is able to reduce the differences among
speech contaminated by different types of noise.
4.1 Mel-Scale Frequency Filter Bank
The Mel-scale frequency filter bank we use in this research consists of 23 filters placed
along the frequency axis. The center frequencies are equally distributed along the Mel-
scale, inspired by psychophysical findings in auditory perception. The filters are triangle
shaped, and the adjacent filters overlap 50%. This filter bank is used in the standard MFCCs
feature extraction algorithm [?], where the center frequency of each channel is defined as
follows:
Mel(x) = 2595Ã log10(1 +
x
700
) (4.1)
The entire Mel-scale frequency filter bank used in this thesis is shown in Figure ??. The
41
lowest frequency covered by the filter bank is 64 Hz and the highest frequency is half of
the sampling rate (i.e. 8 kHz).

Figure 4-1: The frequency response of the Mel-scale frequency filter bank. The filter
bank is composed of 23 filters placed along the frequency axis. The center frequencies are
equally distributed along the Mel-scale. Also, the filters are triangle shaped, and adjacent
filters are half-overlapping. The lowest frequency covered by this filter bank is 64 Hz and
the highest covered frequency is half the sampling rate (i.e. 8 kHz).
As shown in Figure ??, the amplitude of the filters at high frequency is roughly the
same as that of filters at low frequency. Indeed, this design may over-emphasize the high
frequency components of speech signals; however, the filter bank design is used in the
standard MFCCs feature extraction algorithm, which has been shown to be an effective
feature extraction procedure for continuous digit sequence task. Therefore, we leave it as
what it was in our implementation of the Mel-scale frequency filter bank.
42
4.1.1 Closed-loop Model with Mel-scale Frequency Filter Bank
In order to construct a closed-loop model with the Mel-scale frequency filter bank, we inte-
grate the Mel-scale frequency filter bank described in Section ?? into the feature extraction
procedure described in Chapter 3. The resulting closed-loop model is shown in Figure ??.
Figure 4-2: The closed-loop model with Mel-scale frequency filter bank for feature extrac-
tion.
The lower bound of the DRW module and the gain profile, G, in Figure ?? are tuned
according to Section ??. Once the parameters are found, the input signal then goes through
each of the components in Figure ?? sequentially and then, finally, are converted to a
closed-loop speech representation for the input signal. In Section ??, we show visual com-
parisons between the open-loop and the closed-loop models with Mel-scale frequency filter
bank for one utterance embedded in several types of background noises.
4.1.2 Spectrograms of Mel-Scale Frequency Filter Bank
In this section, we visualize the differences between the speech representations generated
by the open-loop model and the closed-loop model with the Mel-scale frequency filter bank.
The utterance used in this comparison is a sequence of digits, 8936233. In order to see how
consistent the speech representations generated by the two models for different noises are,
the utterance is embedded in five different kinds of noise; namely, speech-shaped, white,
pink [?], train station and subway station noise [?]. Notice that the noise signals embedded
in the speech are of the same energy level, and the noisy speech signals are of the same
signal to noise ratio (SNR). The goal is to see if the closed-loop model is more capable of
producing a more robust speech representation for various types of noise than the open-
43
loop model. Before showing the spectrograms, we show the segmented spectrums of these
five types of noise in Figure ?? to see how different these five noises are. The spectrums
are computed using a hamming window and a 512-point FFT window length.

512-point FFT window length.

As shown in Figure ??, different types of noise may have very different enery distribu-
tions, which make robust speech recognition difficult.

tions have a more consistent background appearance even though there is some loss of low
intensity speech information.
4.2 Gammatone Filter Bank
Recalling that the Mel-scale is rooted in a psychophysical origin (pitch perception), we
would like to use a filter bank related to cochlear mechanics. In our study, in the category
of linear filters, we use the gammatone filter bank. The center frequency distribution of the
gammatone filter bank is according to the equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) scale
[?].
The gammatone filter bank used in this research project was designed by Malcom
Slaney [?]. The gammatone filter bank consists of 112 overlapping linear gammatone fil-
ters; the bandwidth of each filter increases proportionally with center frequency, and the
ERB of the filter bank matches psychoacoustic data. The impulse response of the gamma-
tone filters can be described as [?]:
Y (t) = atnâ1eâ2Ïbt cos(2Ïfct+ Ï), t > 0 (4.2)
The parameter b controls the duration of the impulse response. We set b = 1.019 Ã
ERB(fc), ERB(fc) is the equivalent rectangular bandwidth of the filter with center fre-
quency fc. The ERB(fc) function is described as:
ERB(fc) = 24.7 + 0.108Ã fc (4.3)
The parameter n in equation ?? determines the slope of the skirts of the filter; in our
experiment, we set n = 4. Lastly, the parameter a in equation ?? is a normalization
constant. The frequency response of the filter with center frequency at 766 Hz designed by
Slaney is shown in the following figure.
With both equation ?? and equation ??, we can expect that the bandwidth of the filters
in the gammatone filter bank will be proportional to their center frequencies. Figure ??

4.2.1 Closed-loop Model with Gammatone Filter Bank
In order to construct a closed-loop model with the gammatone filter bank, we integrate
the gammatone filter bank described in Section ?? into the feature extraction procedure
described in Chapter 3. The resulting closed-loop model is shown in Figure ??.
The lower bound of the DRW module and the gain profile, G, in Figure ?? are tuned
according to Section ??. Once the parameters are found, the input signal then goes through
each of the components in Figure ?? sequentially and then, finally, are converted to a
closed-loop speech representation for the input signal. In Section ??, we show visual com-
parisons between the open-loop and the closed-loop models with gammatone filter bank
for one utterance embedded in several types of background noises.

In this section, we visualize the speech representations generated by both the open-loop
model and the closed-loop model with the gammatone filter bank. We then compare the
differences between the two representations and discuss the strengths and weakness of each
model. The utterance and the noise signals are the same as those used in Section ??. Figure
?? and Figure ?? show the visual comparisons.
As pointed out in Section ??, the closed-loop representations have a more consistent
background appearance. This consistency is helpful for robust speech recognition for dif-
ferent types of noise. However, as noticeable in the case of white noise for the closed-loop
model, some speech signals are lost at high frequencies. The loss of speech information
happens because the energy levels of white noise at high frequencies are relatively high;
therefore, the gains found for these high frequency channels are small. As a result, when
49

speech signals go through these filters, signals within those sub-bands are amplified rel-
atively less than other channels. Consequently, the energy of speech in those channels
appears weaker than others. Therefore, there is a trade-off between production of a more
consistent background appearance and loss of speech information when the gain is small.
We discuss the trade-off and present the effects the two issues have on speech recognition
results in Chapter ??. Furthermore, we introduce the multi-band path non-linear model in
next chapter and explain how the MBPNL model can balance the trade-off better.

Multi-Band Path Non-Linear Model
One of the noticeable characteristics of the human cochlea is its non-linear mechanics.
However, neither the Mel-scale frequency filter bank nor the gammatone filter bank are
capable of modeling the non-linearities even though the design of these filters is based on
psychophysical findings. Therefore, inspired by [?], we apply the Multi-Band Path Non-
Linear (MBPNL) model to our feature extraction procedure to mimic the non-linearities
of the human cochlea [?]. More specifically, the MBPNL model changes its bandwidth
and gain according to the input intensity, which matches physiological and psychophysical
observations of the cochlea.
In this chapter, we describe and analyze the characteristics of the MBPNL model. Fur-
ther, we show the potential beneficial use of the MBPNL model for speech recognition by
comparing it with a linear filter bank. Finally, we explain how to construct a closed-loop
feature extraction procedure with the MBPNL model and show speech representations gen-
erated by the model.
5.1 MBPNL Model Description
The MBPNL model, depicted in Figure ??, operates in the time domain, and is composed
of two paths: The upper path is a linear filter, which represents the insensitive, broadband
linear tail response of basilar-membrane tuning curves. The lower path is a compressive
non-linear filter, which represents the sensitive, narrow-band compressive nonlinearity at
53
the tip of the basilar membrane tuning curves [?].
The GAIN component controls the gain of the tip of the basilar membrane tuning
curves, which models the inhibitory efferent-induced response in the presence of noise.
In order to understand the MBPNL model better, we examine the frequency responses of
the MBPNL model in next section.
Figure 5-1: The Multi-Bank Path Non-Linear filter [?]. The upper path is a linear filter
that represents the broadband linear tail response of basilar-membrane tuning curves, and
the lower path is a compressive non-linear filter that models the narrow-band compressive
nonlinearity of the basilar membrane tuning curves. The parameter Gain controls the gain
of the tip of the basilar membrane tuning curves. The gain is controlled by the efferent
feedback mechanism.
5.2 Characteristics of the MBPNL Model
In order to observe the non-linear mechanics of the MBPNL model, we create chirp signals
of different amplitudes and pass the signals through the model to see how the bandwidth
and the gain of the model change with input intensity. Another parameter, the GAIN com-
ponent, mainly affects the operating point of the model; therefore, we also set up the model
with different values for the GAIN component and measure the MBPNL model output for
each setting.
The chirp signals are s(t) = Asin(w0t), with its amplitude, A, varying from 0 dBSPL
54
to 120 dBSPL. The GAIN component is set to 10 dB and goes up to 40 dB with a gap of
10 dB between adjacent settings. The frequency respose of the MBPNL with the center
frequency at 1820 Hz for different input intensities and setup for the GAIN component is
show in both Figure ??.

Figure 5-2: The frequency response for the MBPNL model, with the center frequency
at 1820 Hz, for different input intensities (20-100 dB) and different values for the GAIN
component. From left to right, the first row is for GAIN = 40 and 30 dB, and the second
row is for GAIN = 20 and 10 dB.
There are two important non-linear characteristics of the MBPNL model that should be
pointed out from Figure ??. First of all, when the value of GAIN is fixed, say, 40 dB, which
55
refers to the upper-left sub-graph in Figure ??, the gain of the filter increases when the input
intensity decreases. This feature is helpful for reducing the dynamic range of the output
signal of the model. Second, the bandwidth of the model decreases as the input intensity
becomes smaller. The variable bandwidth has beneficial use in increasing the instantaneous
signal to noise ratio (SNR), which is elaborated in Section ??. Also, the GAIN component
influences the range of gain that the MBPNL model has for different input intensities. We
can see from the upper-left and lower-right sub-graphs, where GAIN equals to 40 dB and
10 dB respectively, in Figure ?? that the range of gain of the MBPNL when GAIN is 40 dB
is larger than that when GAIN is set to 10 dB. The way to find an appropriate value for the
GAIN component of each channel is described in Section ??.
5.3 Enhancement of Instantaneous Signal-to-Noise Ratio
As pointed out in Section ??, the property of variable bandwidth of the MBPNL model has
a beneficial use in increasing the instantaneous SNR. In this section, we explain how the
enhancement of instantaneous SNR happens theoretically, and give concrete examples to
illustrate the idea.
5.3.1 Theoretical Analysis
Figure ?? shows the composition of two noisy signals which are synthesized by adding a
white noise filtered by a gammatone filter centered at 1820 Hz, depicted in Figure ??. The
noise is added to two sine waves of f = 1820Hz with different amplitudes:
si(t) = A sin(2Ïft), where A =

synthesizing the noisy signal analyzed in Section ??.

E[N ]gamma
(5.2)
57
SNRgamma,II =
E[S]gamma,II

(5.3)
E[S]gamma,i is the energy of the sine wave of signal i, i = I or II, and E[N ]gamma is the
energy of the white noise. The noise energy added to the two signals is the same because
length of the two signals is the same.
Instantaneous SNR for MBPNL Filter Bank
The instantaneous SNR for the two signals after both of them go through an MBPNL model
centered at 1820 Hz, depicted in Figure ??, is analyzed in the following paragraphs.
As the two signals go through the MBPNL model sequentially, the filter changes its
behavior as the input intensity changes. More specifically, when signal I goes through the
filter, the filter behaves as a narrow bandpass filter with a large gain, see filter I in Figure
??, because of the weak intensity. On the other hand, signal II goes through the filter, the
filter behaves as a wide bandpass filter for its stronger intensity. A conceptual illustration
is shown in Figure ??, in which we represent the noisy signal in frequency domain. As
it shows in Figure ??, the second noisy signal is filtered by a wide bandpass filter, which
almost covers the entire bandwidth of the signal. On the contrary, the first noisy signal
is filtered by a much narrower bandpass filter, which filters out most of the noise signal.
Therefore, the instantaneous SNR of the two signals filtered by the MBPNL model can be
described as follows:
SNRMBPNL,I =
E[S]MBPNL,I
E[N ]MBPNL,I
(5.4)
SNRMBPNL,II =
E[S]MBPNL,II
E[N ]MBPNL,II
(5.5)

SNR. The noisy signals are represented in frequency domain imposed with the filters of the

first signal is filtered by a narrow bandpass filter that only allows partial noise signal to go
through, which, in turn, increases the instantaneous SNR of the first part of the signal.

GI and GII are the gain of filter I and filter II in Figure ?? respectively. K is the ratio

??.
The analysis shows that, under the condition of stable background noise level, when the
SNR of an input signal is high, the SNRs for signals filtered by the MBPNL model and a
linear model are roughly the same. On the contrary, if the SNR for the input signal is low,
which indicates a weaker signal intensity, then the MBPNL model is capable of enhancing
the SNR because the non-linear mechanic of the MBPNL model allows a narrow bandpass
filter to operate on the signal, which filters out most of the noise signal.
5.3.2 SNR-grams Comparison
In order to demonstrate the strength of the MBPNL model, we generate by the SNR-grams,
a graph shows the instantaneous SNRs of an utterance on a frame-by-frame and channel-by-
channel basis. We compare the SNR-grams of the MBPNL model and a linear model, i.e.
the gammatone filter bank for this discussion. Both of the models used in this discussion are
open-loop models. The GAIN profile for the open-loop MBPNL is described in [?], which
was chosen to best mimic psychophysical tuning curves of a healthy cochlea in quiet.
The utterance is a TIMIT utterance embedded in a speech-shaped noise, which is de-
scribed in more detail in Section ??. The SNRs for the entire tested utterances are 20 and
10 dBSNR. We synthesize the signal by fixing the background noise level and adjusting the
amplitude of the clean speech to achieve the required SNRs, and then sum the noise and
speech signals together. In the following two sections, we describe how we simulate the
instantaneous SNR for the gammatone filter bank and the MBPNL model respectively.
60
Instantaneous SNR for Gammatone Filter Bank
Because the gammatone filter bank is linear, we are allowed to simulate the instantaneous
SNR by filtering the noise and clean speech signals separately through the filter bank, and
compute the energy of the clean speech and the noise signal within each frame for each
channel independently. The final instantaneous SNR for each frame and each channel can
be calculated by dividing the energy of the clean speech by the energy of the noise signal.
The frame rate and the frame length used in the calculation is the same as those in Section
??. In other words, for a particular frame i and channel c, the instantaneous SNR can be
computed as follows:
SNRi,c =
E[S]i,c
E[N ]i,c
(5.8)
E[S]i,c is the energy of the clean speech signal within frame i of channel c, and E[N ]i,c
is the counterpart element for the noise signal. E[S]i,c and E[N ]i,c can be computed by fil-
tering the clean speech and the noise signal through the filter bank separately. Specifically,
let s(t)c and n(t)c be the output signals by filtering the speech signal and the noise signal
through the c-th filter in the filter bank.
E[S]i,c =

t
sc(t)
2 for t within frame i (5.9)
N [S]i,c =
â
t
nc(t)
2 for t within frame i (5.10)
Instantaneous SNR for MBPNL model
Since the MBPNL model is non-linear, we cannot use same method that was applied to the
gammatone filter bank to compute the instantaneous SNR for the MBPNL model; i.e, filter-
ing the speech and noise signals separately and calculate the energy for both of them inde-
pendently. Instead, we need to bound the instantaneous SNR at the output of the MBPNL
model by using SNR values that we are able to compute precisely.
From the composition of the MBPNL model shown in Figure ??, we know the SNR
61
of the output signal is the same as the SNR of the signals at the output of the compressor,
which will be refereed as SNRMBPNL, since H2 is a wide bandpass filter. Also notice that
the input to the compressor is the sum of the upper path signal, s(t)upper and the lower path
s(t)lower signal. Therefore, we bound the SNRMBPNL according to the following three
cases.
First, when s(t)upper  s(t)lower, the upper path signal dominates the addition. As a
result, we can ignore the lower path and view the over all model as a linear filter because the
upper path contains an expandor which cancels out the effect of the compressor. Therefore,
in this case, SNRMBPNL ' SNRH3 , where SNRH3 is the SNR of output signals of the
linear filter in the upper path, H3.
Second, when s(t)lower  s(t)upper, then the lower path signal dominates the addition.
Again, we can omit the upper path and view the over all model as if it contains only the
lower path. We then bound SNRMBPNL by SNRH1 , the SNR value of the output signal
of H1. Finally, when s(t)lower ' s(t)upper, we bound SNRMBPNL by the minimum of
SNRH1 and SNRH3 . Because H1 and H3 are both linear filters, we can compute SNRH3
and SNRH1 by following the procedure we use for the gammatone filter bank. The in-
stantaneous SNR of the MBPNL model for each frame for each channel can be defined as
follows:
SNRMBPNL,i,c '
ï£±ï£´ï£´ï£´ï£´ï£´ï£²ï£´ï£´ï£´ï£´ï£´ï£³
SNRH3,i,c if s(t)H3,i,c  s(t)H1,i,c
SNRH1,i,c if s(t)H1,i,c  s(t)H3,i,c
min(SNRH3,i,c, SNRH1,i,c) if s(t)H1,i,c ' s(t)H3,i,c
(5.11)
With the analysis, we generate SNR-grams for both the gammatone filter bank and
the MBPNL model for a TIMIT utterance, âbiologists use radioactive isotopes to study
microorganismsâ, embedded in a speech-shaped noise. The entire SNRs for the tested
utterance are 20 and 10 dBSNR relatively. The SNR-grams as well as a spectrogram are
presented in Figure ?? and Figure ??. The spectrogram is generated by using a 256-point
FFT window, a 256-point Hamming window with a 78% overlapping rate between adjacent
62
frames.
The differences between the SNR-gram for the gammatone filter bank and that for the
MBPNL model are not very clear for the 20 dBSNR utterance. However, for the 10 dB-
SNR utterance, as highlighted by the squares in Figure ??, the MBPNL model enhances
the instantaneous SNR of frames for both consonants and vowels. The capability of in-
creasing instantaneous SNR for utterances when the input intensity is relatively low should
be beneficial for robust speech recognition.
5.4 Integration of MBPNL Filter Bank to Speech Feature
Extraction Procedure
Inspired by [?, ?, ?] and the analysis in Section ??, we are motivated to incorporate the
MBPNL model in the feature extraction algorithm. This is done by inserting the MBPNL
filter bank in the filter bank module in Figure ??. The lowest frequency covered by the
implementation of the MBPNL model used in the thesis is 100 Hz, and the highest covered
frequency is half of the sampling rate of input signals. Further, a closed-loop MBPNL
model is formed by setting up the DRW module and the gain profile according to the
procedure described in Section ??. The closed-loop MBPNL model is depicted in Figure
??.
5.4.1 Spectrograms of MBPNL Model
One visualization of the speech representations generated by the closed-loop MBPNL
model for an utterance embedded in five types of noises shown in Figure ??. As the rep-
resentations produced by the closed-loop models described in Chapter ??, the closed-loop
MBPNL model is capable of generating consistent background representation. In addition,
the non-linear mechanics of the MBPNL model are shown to be helpful for increasing the
instantaneous SNR for weak signals; therefore, the MBPNL may have the potential for
solving the problem of loss of speech information which occurs in the closed-loop linear ,
i.e. the gammatone filter bank and Mel-scale frequency filter bank, models. We set up an

non-linear mechanics of the MBPNL model shown in Section ??, the MBPNL model has
the potential for solving the problem of loss of speech information which happens to the
closed-loop linear models.

Experiment Setup and Results
This chapter describes the experiment conducted to show one of the goals of the thesis: the
strength of the closed-loop feature extraction algorithm for mismatched noise conditions.
It begins with describing the experimental setup. Then, it presents and analyzes the recog-
nition results of models discussed in the thesis; namely, the FFT-based open-loop mel-scale
frequency filter model, the closed-loop model with the Mel-scale frequency filter bank, the
gammatone filter bank, and the MBPNL filter bank.
6.1 Data Setup
This section describes the development of the noisy speech dataset used for this research.
It describes the clean speech dataset and the noise dataset first, and then it explains the
synthesis process used to create the noisy speech.
6.1.1 TIDigits Database
We use utterances from the TIDigits database as the clean speech for the automatic speech
recognition (ASR) experiment. TIDigits is a database for speaker independent digit recog-
nition; specifically, each utterance consists of a sequence of digits spoken in a quiet envi-
ronment. In our experiments, 6,752 utterances are chosen for the training set, and 1,001 ut-
terances are used for the test set. All the speech data are re-sampled at a sampling frequency
69
of 8 kHz. For the purpose of comparison, the Aurora Project Database 2.0 (Aurora2) also
uses utterances from the TIDigits in its development of dataset [?].
6.1.2 Noise Dataset
The speech-shaped noise used in [?] is included in the noise dataset. The speech-shaped
noise, though stationary, is challenging, since it has a similar effect to the masking produced
by a number of other speakers speaking at the same time (i.e. babble noise). In addition,
two more stationary noises, white noise and pink noise [?], are also included to broaden
the variety of the dataset. Furthermore, for the purpose of proving the robustness of closed-
loop models, two non-stationary noises, subway noise and train noise, are picked from
the noise database of Aurora2. Therefore, the models are tested on both stationary and
non-stationary noises.
6.1.3 Data Synthesis
Five training sets are created for the experiments, and each of them consists of noisy speech
synthesized by adding one of the five noises described in Section ?? with the 6,762 chosen
clean speech from the TIDigits. For each training set, the 6,752 sentences are evenly di-
vided into four subsets, and each of the four subsets contains 1,688 noisy speech files of 5
dBSNR, 10 dBSNR, 15 dBSNR and 20 dBSNR, respectively. We adjust the amplitude of
noise signals to create noises at an energy level of 70 dBSPL, and then adjust the amplitude
of clean speech so that when it is added to the noise signals, it creates noisy speech of one
of the SNR values described above. In the synthesis process, we apply the ITU software
[?] to determine noise energy levels and SNRs. The energy distribution of the five noises
we use in this experiment is presented in Figure ??. It should be noted that instead of fixing
the speech signals and adjusting the amplitude of noise signals, we fix the noise signals and
adjust the amplitude of speech signals to form noisy data at different SNRs.
Five test sets are set up, and each one of the five test sets consists of noisy speech data
synthesized by adding one of the noise types listed above to the 1,001 chosen test utterances
from the TIDigits database. The procedure used to generate the test data sets is the same as
70
that used for creating the training set. All the noisy speech in the test dataset has an SNR
value of 20 dB. No overlap occurs between any training and testing utterances.
For closed-loop models, the gain profile which adjusts the operating point of the filter
bank should be determined before the speech signals are processed. In fact, the gain profile
is designed to respond to background noise on a real-time basis, so that the filter bank can
adapt to a new environment rapidly. Therefore, in order to enable the real-time computation
for the gain file, for each utterance, we add 300 ms of noise at the beginning of the signal.
As a result, when the speech signal goes through the closed-loop form of feature extraction
procedure, the first 300 ms of noise is used to compute the gain profile for the filter bank.
When the speech part of the signal comes in, the filter bank is already regulated to a proper
operating point to process the speech signal.
6.2 Mismatched Noise Experiments
This section describes the experimental setup and explains how the performance of differ-
ent models are compared. Also, it depicts the recognizer used in the experiments. At the
end, it presents the recognition performance of all the models discussed in this thesis and
analyzes the experiment results.
6.2.1 Setup
One strength of the closed-loop models is their capability of generating consistent speech
representations even if the background noise varies. In order to validate that the closed-
loop model generates a useful speech representation, we conduct speech recognition exper-
iments for mismatched training and test noise conditions.
Six models are compared in the thesis; namely, 1) the FFT baseline model, 2) the FFT
baseline model with noise normalization, 3) the FFT baseline model with speech normal-
ization and 4) the closed-loop models with the mel-scale filter bank, 5) the gammatone
filter bank and 6) the MBPNL filter bank. We use the software in the Aurora2 database [?]
as our FFT baseline model implementation. For the FFT baseline with normalized speech
signals, the speech data are scaled to a fixed maximum value. The FFT baseline with noise
71
normalization utilizes the first 300 ms of noise at the beginning of each utterance to ac-
complish the normalization task. Specifically, it computes the total energy of the noise and
finds a gain such that after being multiplied with the gain, the energy of the noise at the
beginning of each utterance will be a fixed level. After the gain is found, we then scale the
entire speech signal with that gain. The FFT baseline therefore can be viewed as a simpli-
fied version of the closed-loop model which has only one universal gain for all channels.
For each model and each type of noise described previously, the recognizer is trained by
the speech features generated by the model and tested on speech data contaminated by all
of the five kinds of noise. Therefore, for each model, there are twenty five training and test
combinations. All experiments use a 42-dimensional feature vector, including energy and
13 cepstral coefficients and their first- and second-order time derivatives.
6.2.2 Recognizer
An HMM based recognizer is specified in the Aurora2 database [?], based on the HTK
software package. The recognizer is utilized for the digit recognition task in the thesis.
More specifically, the digits are modeled as a whole word HMM with 16 states, and each
state is a mixture of 3 diagonal Gaussian mixtures. Two pause models are defined. One
is the âsilâ model, which models the silence at the beginning and the end of an utterance,
consisting of 3 states and 6 diagonal Gaussians in each state; the other is the âspâ model,
which models the pauses between words, consisting of a single state. In the recognition
phase, each utterance can be modeled as a sequence of digits with the possibility of âsilâ at
the beginning and the end of one utterance and âspâ between words [?].
6.2.3 Results
This section presents the recognition results of six models described in the thesis. For each
model, the recognizer is trained by speech data of one type of noise, and the recognizer
is tested on all of the five kinds of noise described in Section ??. Therefore, for each
model, there are twenty five training and test conditions; five of them correspond to matched
training and test noise conditions and twenty of them represent mismatched conditions. The
72
results for the six models discussed in the thesis are shown from Table ?? to Table ??

6.3 Results Analysis
From the recognition performances shown in Table ?? to Table ??, it can be seen that the
performance of the open-loop models degrade severely when the training and test noises are
mismatched. On the contrary, the closed-loop models are able to generate more consistent
recognition performances across all training and test conditions. In this section, we analyze
the results in more detail and discuss the performances of the six models for both matched
and mismatched training and test conditions.
6.3.1 Matched Conditions
Figure ?? shows the recognition word accuracy rates of the six feature extraction proce-
dures for the five matched training and test conditions. The recognizer was trained on
features generated by one of the six algorithms described above from speech contained one
of the five noises; namely, speech-shaped, white, pink, train and subway noises, and then it
was tested on speech contaminated by the same noise. From Figure ??, it can be seen that
the recognition word accuracy rates of FFT baseline for the five matched training and test
cases are better than those of the closed-loop models by 1.4% on average. However, even
though the performances of the closed-loop models degrade slightly by a small percentage
compared with the FFT baseline, the recognition performances of the closed-loop models
are consistent. More details are shown in Table ??.
Table 6.7: The table shows the average recognition word accuracy rates and the variances of
the recognition performance of the six feature extraction algorithms across the five matched
training and test conditions. Some notations: FFT/Noise stands for the algorithm of the FFT
baseline with noise normalization, FFT/Speech stands for the FFT baseline with speech
normalization.

Figure 6-1: The figure shows the recognition word accuracy rates for the six feature ex-
traction algorithms for five matched training and test conditions. The six feature extraction
algorithms are FFT baseline, FFT baseline with noise normalization, FFT baseline with
speech normalization, closed-loop model with Mel-scale frequecy filter bank, closed-loop
model with gammatone filter bank and closed-loop model with MBPNL filter bank. The
five noises are speech-shaped, white, pink, train and subway noises. The recognizer was
trained on features generated by one of the six extraction procedures from speech contained
one of the five noises and tested on speech embedded in the same noise type. It shows that
the performance of the FFT baseline is slightly better than the closed-loop models; how-
ever, the performances of the FFT baseline and the performances of the closed-loop models
are consistent.
The numbers shown in Table ?? are computed from raw data which have a higher
precision than numbers shown in Table ?? to Table ??. It lists the average recognition word
accuracy rates and the variances of the recognition performance of the six feature extraction
algorithms across the five matched training and test conditions. According to the table, we
can see that the performances of the closed-loop models are quite consistent for all of the
five training and test sets because the variances of the recognition rates for the closed-loop
models are small.
6.3.2 Mismatched Conditions
We discuss the performance of the six feature extraction procedures for mismatched train-
ing and test conditions. Specifically, the recognizer was trained on feature representations
generated by one of the six algorithms for speech containing one type of noise in the noise
77
data set, and tested on speech embedded in the four kinds of remaining noises. For each
feature extraction algorithm, there are twenty mismatched training and test conditions. Ta-
ble ?? shows the average word accuracy rates for the six models for the twenty mismatched
training and test conditions. We used raw data to compute the numbers in Table ??; there-
fore, the numbers shown in this table have a higher precision. Figure ?? visualizes the data
shown in Table ??, where the x-axis represents the variance of the performances for one
feature extraction algorithm, and the y-axis represents the average word recognition accu-
racy rate across all the mismatched conditions. The more upper-left the point locates in the
figure, the better the performance of the model represented by the point is.
Table 6.8: The table shows the average recognition word accuracy rates and the variances of
the recognition performance of the six feature extraction algorithms across the twenty mis-
matched training and test conditions. Some notations: FFT/Noise stands for the algorithm
of the FFT baseline with noise normalization, FFT/Speech stands for the FFT baseline with
speech normalization.

As Figure ?? shows, the closed-loop models tend to have higher average word accuracy
rates and the performances of the closed-loop models are more consistent across all training
and test conditions than the FFT baseline models.
6.3.3 Overall Performances
From the analysis shown in the previous two sections, we can see that even though the
FFT baseline model generated slightly better recognition results for matched training and
test conditions, its performance degraded severely and varied substantially for mismatched
training and test conditions. In contrast, even though the closed-loop models performed
slightly worse than the FFT baseline model by 1.4% on average for matched training and

matched training and test conditions, performances of the six feature extraction procedures
discussed in this thesis. The x-axis and y-axis represent the average recognition word ac-
curacy rate and the variance recognition word accuracy rate respectively.
Figure ?? shows that for all of the twenty five training and test conditions, the closed-
loop models reached higher average recognition accuracy rates and performed more con-
sistently than the FFT baseline models. Among the closed-loop models, the one with the
MBPNL filter bank performed the best. The better performance that the closed-loop model
with the MBPNL filter bank obtained could attribute to several reasons. First, as shown in
Section ??, the nonlinearities of the MBPNL model potentially increase the instantaneous
SNR values for the weak part of a signal, which should be helpful in enhancing the speech
recognition performance. Second, the MBPNL filter bank contains 112 filters spreading
through the entire bandwidth of the speech signals, i.e. from 100 Hz to half of the sampling
rate. Compared with the Mel-scale frequency filter bank which consists of only twenty

Conclusions and Potential Work
After analyzing the experimental results, we reached various conclusions from this thesis
work. In the following sections, we summarize the main findings for the proposed closed-
loop auditory-based algorithm and point out the contributions of the thesis. In addition,
the idea of integrating a feedback mechanism with speech feature extraction algorithms
is examined in this thesis; however, the concept of exploiting a feedback mechanism to
regulate the operation points of filters in a feature extraction algorithm has not yet been
widely explored yet. An auditory-based approach to determine the operating points has
been proposed in this thesis; nevertheless, there are other potential approaches to uncov-
ering appropriate feedback information. These additional potential approaches as well as
directions for future work are discussed at the end of this chapter.
7.1 Conclusions
A new feedback mechanism is added to the standard feature extraction method to form a
closed-loop model to address the problem of unseen noise for robust speech recognition.
The feedback mechanism is motivated by the MOC efferent system, which consistent ev-
idence suggests is critical to the robust performance of the human auditory periphery. In
order to show that the closed-loop model produces consistent output, we created a database
based on TIDigits, in which five kinds of noise are added to the speech at different signal
to noise ratios (SNRs) and a constant sound pressure level (SPL). The closed-loop model
81
is constructed with the Mel-scale filter bank, the gammatone filter bank, and the MBPNL
filter bank. The closed-loop method shows an average of absolute reduction of 9.7%, 9.1%
and 11.4% in word error rate, respectively, compared with the standard MFCC method
when the noise in the training data and the test data are mismatched.
In addition, the MBPNL model [?, ?] is introduced to the speech feature extraction
algorithm. The nonlinear behavior of the MBPNL model is analyzed and shown to be
helpful in increasing the instantaneous SNR of a signal if the intensity of the signal is
relatively weak. This feature may have more potentially beneficial applications to robust
speech recognition.
7.1.1 Contributions
In summary, the thesis makes two major contributions.
1) Integrating a Feedback Mechanism for ASR Feature Extraction
First, we apply the concept of the efferent feedback mechanism introduced in [?, ?, ?] to de-
velop a closed-loop feature extraction algorithm, which allows the filter bank to adapt to the
background environment dynamically. In Chapter ??, the feedback information was shown
to have the potential to address the problem of unseen noise for robust speech recognition.
2) Analysis of the Non-linear Behavior of the MBPNL Model
Secondly, we analyzed the MBPNL model further and systematically demonstrated its ca-
pability of increasing the instantaneous SNR of weak noisy signals.
7.2 Potential Future Work
This section discusses the potential future research directions, focusing specifically on the
two main directions, modifications of the feedback mechanism and applications of the
MBPNL model to robust speech recognition tasks.
82
7.2.1 Setup of DRW and Gain Profile
In this thesis, the procedure applied to set up the lower bound of the DRW and to determine
the gain profile of the filter bank in a closed-loop model is inspired by observations of the
human auditory periphery. Based on the idea of the spontaneous firing rate of the auditory
nerves, the gain profile, in particular, one major component of the closed-loop model, is
tuned such that when one noise signal goes through the filter bank, the energy of the noise
signal at each channel is just below the lower bound of the DRW. This method is just one
means of configuring the gain profile; other ways may exist. For example, the gain profile
can also be adjusted based on other feedback information, such as recognition confidence
scores, just as the gain profile can be adjusted iteratively until the confidence score on a
certain set of test data is high enough. Seeking out an efficient algorithm by which to
achieve fast convergence of the gain profile based on confidence scores may be a research
area worthy of exploration.
7.2.2 Alternatives to DCT
In this thesis, the output signals of the filter bank are converted to input vectors for the rec-
ognizer via the discrete cosine transformation (DCT). The discrete cosine transformation
has proven itself to be an efficient way to reduce the complexity of the output signals of
a filter bank for open-loop models, such as the FFT baseline model. However, whether
nor not DCT is the best complexity reduction technique that can be applied to the output
signals of a closed-loop model has yet to be examined. In particular, the closed-loop model
changes the energy distribution of the output signals, thereby resulting in a very different
distribution than that of open-loop models. As a result, even though DCT has been shown
to be an effective complexity reduction method for open-loop models, it is not necessar-
ily as effective for closed-loop models. Furthermore, DCT was used in this research to
transform d-dimensional vectors to 13-dimensional vectors, where d represents the number
of filters. The decision to utilize thirteen dimensions was based on the procedure of ex-
tracting MFCCs for speech signals; this number may not actually be the optimal option for
closed-loop models.
83
Investigating both the optimal complexity reduction technique and the optimal dimen-
sion choice for the final speech representation of closed-loop models should prove interest-
ing in future research.
7.2.3 Application of MBPNL model to Robust Speech Recognition
The nonlinear mechanics of the MBPNL model is further examined in this thesis, and it
shows that the nonlinearity of the MBPNL model is shown to be helpful with increasing
instantaneous SNR of speech signals. This is a powerful feature of the MBPNL model;
however, we believe that this powerful feature of the MBPNL model has not been exploited
to the fullest extent. The challenge that remains is to design a feature extraction system
with components that can maximize the use of the feature and leverage the strength of the
MBPNL model for robust speech recognition.
