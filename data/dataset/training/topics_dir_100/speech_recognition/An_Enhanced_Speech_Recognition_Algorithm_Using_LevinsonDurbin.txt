ABSTRACT 
 
In this paper, we applied techniques such as Levinson-Durbin, DTW and maximum likelihood classification to achieve an 
enhanced speech recognition algorithm. Speech recognition has been adversely affected by noise and some other impairments 
factors making speech difficult to be recognized. Speech is distorted by a background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics.  
We used the combinatorial approach of Levinson-Durbin, DTW and maximum likelihood classification to develop a system for 
speech recognition. The system compares the speech with phonetics lattice and database of enrolled speeches from different 
speakers and output the enrolled speech with the recognition Id and name of the identified speech if it found a match. Otherwise 
error of unknown is returned to show speech mismatch. The system is able to distinguish two different speakers at any point in 
time using speech identity and phonetic pattern analysis. 
 
Keywords: Levinson-Durbin, DTW and maximum likelihood.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Accents, regional dialects, sex, age, speech impediments, 
emotional state and other factors cause people to pronounce 
the same word in different ways. Automatic Speech 
Recognition (ASR) is an important task in digital signal 
processing related applications. It is the process of 
automatically converting the spoken words into written text by 
the computer system [3]. Research on Speech recognition 
system has been on-going for over 80 years and quite a 
sizeable number of progresses have been attained. One of the 
major problems of all the system designed over the years is 
ability to still recognize a voice even if it has been affected by 
illness or some under uncontrollable circumstance. Speech 
recognition has been accomplished by combining various 
algorithms drawn from different disciplines such as statistical 
pattern recognition, signal processing and linguistics etc [1].  
 
In this paper, we have combined three algorithms: Levinson-
Durbin, DTW and maximum likelihood classification to 
develop an enhanced system for speech recognition. Each of 
these algorithms has outstanding performance in various 
aspect of speech recognition. We have successfully classified 
speech recognition processes into 3 categories and we have 
used an algorithm each of these aspects.  
 
 
The three aspects of speech recognition identified in this work 
include: 
• Speech feature extraction 
•  Pattern matching techniques 
•  Dynamic Programming- 
 
Dynamic features are generally helpful in capturing temporal 
information. Features are extracted before template matching 
takes place. Firstly, the dynamic programming techniques 
have been proposed for spoken word recognition based on 
template matching approach.  
 
We can use the Maximum Likelihood classification for 
matching a given utterance against a predefined vocabulary 
represented by DTW. 
 
Linear prediction analysis of these features is done based on 
Levinson-Durbin Recursion. Because of the variability in a 
speech signal, it is better to perform feature extraction in short 
term interval that would reduce these variability. LP analysis 
is performed based on Levinson-Durbin recursion algorithm.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW  
 
Data is the raw information which needs to be processed, they 
are entered into the system as input and processed, and the 
result of the processed data is referred to as the output. The 
data to be processed here is a sound signal recoded as a wave 
file generated from microphone connected to the system. The 
signals collected contain acoustic information which is process 
into a vector format and modeled appropriately for word 
recognition. Vimala and Radha [3] divided signal into smaller 
frames where the useful feature vectors were extracted. Then, 
these feature vectors are divided into training and testing 
features. Speech feature extraction is the signal processing 
frontend which converts the speech waveform into some 
useful parametric representation. These parameters are then 
used for further analysis in various speech related applications 
such as speech recognition, speaker recognition, speech 
synthesis and speech coding. It plays an important role to 
separate speech patterns from one another [2] [5][6]. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.1 Analysis Of Input 
Early attempts to design systems for automatic speech 
recognition were mostly guided by the theory of acoustic-
phonetics, which describes the phonetic elements of speech 
(the basic sounds of the language) and tries to explain how 
they are acoustically realized in a spoken utterance. 
 
These elements include the phonemes and the corresponding 
place and manner of articulation used to produce the sound in 
various phonetic contexts. For example, in order to produce a 
steady vowel sound, the vocal cords need to vibrate (to excite 
the vocal tract), and the air that propagates through the vocal 
tract results in sound with natural modes of resonance similar 
to what occurs in an acoustic tube. These natural modes of 
resonance, called the formants or formant frequencies, are 
manifested as major regions of energy concentration in the 
speech power spectrum. In 1952, Davis, Biddulph, and 
Balashek of Bell Laboratories built a system for isolated digit 
recognition for a single speaker, using the formant frequencies 
measured (or estimated) during vowel regions of each digit. 
The Figure 1 below shows a block diagram of the digit 
recognizer developed by Daviset al., and Figure 2 shows plots 
of the formant trajectories along the dimensions of the first 
and the second formant frequencies for each of the ten digits, 
one-nine and oh, respectively. These trajectories served as the 
“reference pattern” for determining the identity of an unknown 
digit utterance as the best matching digit.[7]

2.2 Maximum Likelihood classification 
This paper work had been able to show the principles of the 
algorithms used for simple speech recognition tasks like the 
recognition of connected digits. It also shows how we can use 
the Maximum Likelihood classification for matching a given 
utterance against a predefined vocabulary represented by 
DTW. The algorithms used were quite straightforward and had 
a very regular structure. Saul and Rahim (2000) worked on 
maximum likelihood classification. According to them factor 
analysis uses a small number of parameters to model the 
covariance structure of high dimensional data. These 
parameters can be chosen in two ways: (1) to maximize the 
likelihood of observed speech signals, or (2) to minimize the 
number of classification errors. We derive an expectation-
maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood 
estimation and a gradient descent algorithm for improved class 
discrimination. Speech recognizers are evaluated on two tasks, 
one small-sized vocabulary (connected alpha-digits) and one 
medium-sized vocabulary.  
 
(New Jersey town names). We find that modeling feature 
correlations by factor analysis leads to significantly increased 
likelihoods and word accuracies. Saul and Rahim (2000). In 
their work, Saul and Rahim (2000) used factor analysis to 
model correlations between cepstra, delta-cepstra, and delta-
delta-cepstra. It is worth emphasizing, however that the 
method applies to arbitrary features. Indeed, the ability to, 
model correlations efficiently should enable researchers to 
consider other features besides ceptra.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
While cepstra have the advantage of being only weakly 
correlated, it may be that other features (e.g., narrow-band 
statistics) actually convey more information about the speech 
signal. Saul and Rahim (2000) 
 
2.3 Dynamic Programming / Dynamic Time Warping 
Dynamic time warping (DTW) is a well-known technique to 
find an optimal alignment between two given (time-
dependent) sequences under certain restrictions. DTW 
technique is used for feature matching in speaker recognition. 
Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a non linear fashion to 
match each other. Originally, DTW has been used to compare 
different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition. In 
fields such as data mining and information retrieval, DTW has 
been successfully applied to automatically cope with time 
deformations and different speeds associated with time-
dependent data. Muller,M (2007).  
 
The time alignment of different utterances is the core problem 
for distance measurement in speech recognition. A small shift 
leads to incorrect identification. Dynamic Time Warping is an 
efficient method to solve the time alignment problem. DTW 
algorithm aims at aligning two sequences of feature vectors by 
warping the time axis repetitively until an optimal match 
between the two sequences is found. This algorithm performs 
a piece wise linear mapping of the time axis to align both the 
signals. Shivanker , Geeta and, Poonam (2013) 
 
The procedure we defined to compare two sequences of 
vectors is also known as Dynamic Programming (DP) or as 
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). In another words, Dynamic 
time warping is an algorithm for measuring similarity between 
two sequences that may vary in time or speed.

3. DESIGN METHODOLOGY 
 
Data Flow Diagram (DFD) Of The System 
 
 
Figure 4: Data Flow Diagram 
 
 
The algorithms are combined and put into use here. Each of 
the algorithm performs various tasks at each stage of the 
system. The system accepts input in form of speech. Features 
extraction is performed on the speech input and this is further 
broken into vectors that can be worked on. Phonetic 
recognition also known as matching is done. This is done 
through the template matching. Phonetic lattice are extracted 
and combined and word recognition is eventually done.  
 
4. IMPLEMENTATION, RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  
 
The Speech Recognition algorithm is implemented here using 
Visual Basic 2008 programming language. The feature 
extraction process here is applied using the Levinson and  
 
 
 
Durbins LPC algorithm and the Dynamic Time Warping for 
the matching. This software is expected to prompt the user for 
input which is the user utterance, it capture it search the inbuilt 
vocabularies using (Dynamic Time Wrap) DTW and compare 
the captured sound with the inbuilt sound using levinson - 
durbin algorithm. It give out the sound captured inform of text 
as the output after all the processing. Thus, identifying the 
enrolled speech through the speech Id that identifies distinct 
speakers. The testing here was done with varieties of 
utterances from people with different speed of talking and 
accent. The other testing done here was carried out where we 
have some sound distortion like background and a desired 
output was generated.

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS 
 
This project covered the basics of speech recognition up to the 
principles of connected word recognition and matching. We 
also pointed out the disadvantages of these primitive 
algorithms. However, the algorithm was able to handle 
isolated word recognition (IWR) and continuous speech 
recognition (CSR) process it by looking (searching) for the 
best match from the inbuilt vocabularies. 
 
6. RECOMMENDATIONS 
 
There are challenges facing these algorithms. Like other 
supervised learning algorithms. Speech recognition (by a 
machine) is a very complex problem. Vocalizations vary in 
terms of accent, pronunciation, articulation, roughness, 
nasality, pitch, volume, and speed. Speech is distorted by a 
background noise and echoes, electrical characteristics. 
Accuracy of speech recognition varies with the following: 
• Vocabulary size and confusability 
• Speaker dependence vs. independence 
• Isolated, discontinuous, or continuous speech 
• Task and language constraints 
• Read vs. spontaneous speech 
• Adverse conditions 
So there is a need for improvement or more efficient 
algorithm.
