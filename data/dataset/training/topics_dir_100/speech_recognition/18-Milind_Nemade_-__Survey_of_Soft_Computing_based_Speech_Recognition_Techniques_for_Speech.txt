I. INTRODUCTION 
Speech is the fundamental, most effective, reliable and 
common medium to communicate in real time systems.  In 
market due to advancement in technology many speech 
communication applications based devices is available, they 
are cheaper and easily available. However, undesired noises 
in environment cause undesired effects in real time speech 
processing systems. Human communications and intelligent 
machines are suffers from the degraded performance in 
which they takes decision based on what it receives as a 
speech.   
Earlier many researchers investigated and developed 
various approaches for noise reduction and speech 
enhancements. The speech enhancement is useful for storage 
and transmission of speech data, also it improves speech 
recognition based system performance where accurate 
identification of words and sentences can provide 
automation in most of the human-machine or machine-
machine based interface. Speech enhancement can boost up 
the performance of speech recognition systems by keeping 
low word error rate (WER). 
There are number of speech recognition systems exists, 
some of them integrated into task specific applications. In 
practical applications a robust Mandarin Speech Recognition 
system using neural networks applied to multimedia 
interfaces performs better [5]. The speech recognition used 
in a multimedia speech therapy system for different 
problems and different ages. In addition to recording the 
voice and analysing the recorded spoken signal, speech 
recognition performs identification of speech irregularities 
and tracking the patient progress using time frequency 
analysis and neural network techniques [6]. 
The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: 
In next section II, schematic diagram of speech recognition 
system is explained. Section III explains existing work 
related to the speech recognition techniques. Section IV 
explains literature survey of beamforming based speech 
enhancement technique. Section V explains review of soft 
computing techniques used for speech recognition. Section 
VI explains commonly used performance measuring 
parameters for speech recognition.  Finally, paper is 
concluded in section VII. 
II. SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
The Speech recognition methods were first attempted in 
1952 at Bell Laboratories, Davis, Biddulph and Balashek 
developed an isolated digit recognition system for a single 
speaker [1]. There are two task of speech identification, 
closed set or open set. Closed set identification involved 
identification of speech which already exists in the database 
otherwise it is open set speech identification task. Isolated 
word speech recognition required each utterance to have 
silence on both sides of the word while it is difficult to 
recognize speech in continuous word recognition [2]. Speech 
recognition system is used as intelligence home in personal

communication applications. It is also used in banking 
systems [3, 4]. Fig.1 shows the schematic diagram of speech 
recognition system for human being. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of speech recognition system 
 
L. Rabiner, B.H. Juang and B. Yegnanarayana presented 
the approach of simple speech recognition system [7]. It 
consists of four main building blocks speech analysis, 
feature extraction, language translation and message 
understanding. Speech analysis stage consists of noise 
removal, silence removal and end point detection. End point 
detection and removal of noise, silence is required to 
improve the performance of speech recognition system. 
Noisy speech processes along the basilar membrane in the 
inner ear, which provides spectrum analysis of noisy speech. 
The speech analysis also deals with suitable frame size for 
segmenting speech signal for further analysis using 
segmentation, sub segmental and supra segmental analysis 
techniques [8]. 
Feature extraction and coding stage reduces the 
dimensionality of the input vector and maintain 
discriminating power of the signal. We need feature 
extraction because the number of training and test vector 
needed for the classification problem grows with the 
dimension of the given input. Linear Predictive Coding 
(LPC) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are 
the most widely used methods for feature extraction. MFCC 
preferred over LPC because it is less prone to noise. The 
spectral signal output of speech analysis converted to 
activity signals on the auditory nerve using neural 
transduction method. Then activity signal converted into a 
language code within the brain, and finally message 
understanding is achieved. 
III. SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES 
Speech recognition techniques classified into three main 
categories as Temporal, Artificial Neural Network and 
Stochastic techniques. Temporal speech recognition 
classified as Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Vector 
Quantization (VQ), while stochastic modelling as Hidden 
Markov Model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Model 
(GMM) and Artificial Neural Network based speech 
recognition classified as Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). 
DTW allows computer to find optimal match between two 
given speech sequences with certain restrictions. The 
decision to be taken is based on the global distance measures 
between two speech patterns [9]. For DTW there exists trade 
off between the recognition accuracy and the computational 
efficiency. In DTW optimization process is performed using 
dynamic programming. VQ is useful for speech coder and 
often applied to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). It 
uses compact codebooks for reference models. VQ used with 
DTW/HMM results in reduction of storage and 
computational time [10].  MLP is neural network technique 
based on back propagation (BP) algorithm used as a 
classifier in which nodes are connected in adjacent layer by 
weights. Performance of MLP degrades in the noisy 
environments. 
Stochastic is probabilistic model deal with uncertain 
information and more suitable to speech recognition.HMM 
is popular stochastic approach characterized by finite state 
markov model and a set of output distributions [11].  GMM 
is text independent speech recognition modelling technique. 
In GMM each speaker has the independent GMM model and 
output of GMM is passed through maximum likelihood 
sequence detector to determine the usable speech. 
IV. SPEECH RECOGNITION TECHNIQUES 
There are various types of advanced speech enhancement 
algorithms and they can be classified in main three 
categories, namely; filtering/estimation based noise 
reduction, beam forming and active noise cancellation 
(ANC) techniques. In beam-forming, based speech 
enhancement more than one speech channels (microphones) 
are used to process the speech. Speech signals are received 
simultaneously by all microphones and outputs of these 
sensors are then processed to estimate the clean speech 
signal. In adaptive beamforming, an array of antennas is 
exploited to achieve maximum reception in a specified 
direction by estimating the signal arrival from a desired 
direction (in the presence of noise) while signals of the same 
frequency from other directions are rejected. This is 
achieved by varying the weights of each of the sensors 
(antennas) used in the array. This kind of speech 
enhancement techniques can give better performance of the 
speech applications like automatic speech recognition (ASR) 
than signal channel processing. Only disadvantage with this 
class of methods is higher cost of hardware, which can put 
restriction on using these methods in some speech 
applications.  The basic block diagram of beamformer is 
shown in Fig.2.

Fig. 2 Beamformer: An Adaptive array system 
Frost [12] has suggested constrained minimum power 
adaptive beamforming, which deals with the problem of a 
broadband signal received by an array, where pure delay 
relates each pair of source and sensor. Each sensor signal is 
processed by a tap delay line filter after applying a proper 
time delay compensation to form delay-and-sum 
beamformer. The algorithm is capable of satisfying some 
desired frequency response in the look direction while 
minimizing the output noise power by using constrained 
minimization of the total output power. This minimization is 
realized by adjusting the taps of the filters under the desired 
constraint using constrained LMS-type algorithm. Griffiths 
and Jim [13] reconsidered Frost’s algorithm and introduced 
the generalized side-lobe canceller (GSC) solution. The GSC 
algorithm is comprised of three building blocks. The first is 
a fixed beamformer, which satisfies the desired constraint. 
The second is a blocking matrix, which produces noise-only 
reference signals by blocking the desired signal (e.g., by 
subtracting pairs of time-aligned signals). The third is an 
unconstrained LMS-type algorithm that attempts to cancel 
the noise in the fixed beamformer output.  For the 
application of hands-free speech recognition, one of the 
works [14] uses sequence of features to be used for speech 
recognition itself, to optimize a filter-and-sum beamformer 
instead of separating the beamformer, to be used for speech 
enhancement, from speech recognition system.  In this work, 
they used frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and 
applied to the HMM based classifier for speech recognition. 
Hong [15] presented the approach to improve the noisy 
speech recognition accuracy using noise spectral subtraction 
and the delay and sum beamformer based microphone array 
processing techniques. 
V. SOFT COMPUTING TECHNIQUES 
Soft computing is the collection of computational 
techniques in engineering disciplines which attempt to study, 
model and analyse very complex problems, where 
conventional methods fails to provide low cost solutions. 
The major components of soft computing are Neural 
Network, Fuzzy Logic and Evolutionary Computation 
(Genetic Algorithm). 
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information 
processing model that is inspired by the way biological 
nervous systems. It consist of large number of highly 
interconnected processing elements (neurons) working in 
accord to solve specific problems. ANN widely used for real 
time operation because ANN computations carried out in 
parallel. Fuzzy logic (FL) is problem solving control system 
methodology envisage by Lotfi Zadef. It deals with 
imprecise data and the data are considered as fuzzy sets. FL 
used in many control system applications since it mimics 
human control logic. Genetic Algorithms (GA’s) are 
adaptive computational procedures modelled on the 
mechanics of natural genetic systems. They executed on a 
set of coded solutions (population) with 
selection/reproduction, crossover and mutation parameters 
[16]. 
In [17] authors have presented the implementation and 
comparison of HMM and ANN techniques for speech 
recognition on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) 
chip. To obtain more precise and optimal solution authors 
used GA to train ANN. Results shows recognition rate for 
HMM is slightly better than for ANN while speed of speech 
recognition is much faster for ANN than HMM. 
Traditionally LBG algorithm is used for codebook design of 
vector quantization. One interesting research paper [18] 
presented approach based on GA-L (GA and LBG) 
algorithm, which improve quality of codebook for vector 
quantization in speech recognition systems. It is more 
effective than traditional LBG algorithm. One research paper 
[19] presented the fuzzy logic recognition approach based on 
power distribution pattern of a segment of a speech in real 
time systems. In this paper pattern generation and pattern 
matching process is used for real time speech processing.  In 
application point of view delay and sum and adaptive 
beamforming algorithm [20] was used inside the noisy 
automobile environment, for the digital cellular phone 
application. In this paper performance criteria as signal to 
noise ratio and speech recognition error rate have been 
evaluated for the processed speech and result shows 
microphone array performs better than a single microphone 
system. In [21] it is shown that beamforming based speech 
enhancement technique improve the performance of speech 
recognition in multi-microphone environment. In this the 
performance of speech recognition against the filter-bank 
parameters; filter length and number of subbands was 
analysed by evaluating percentage of recognition accuracy 
and results obtained proved the speech enhancement 
capability of the beam forming technique in multi-
microphone network. techniques.

are two main terms to measure performance of speech 
recognition system. Speech recognition accuracy is

measured in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) and speech 
recognition time is measured in terms of computation time.  
WER is a common metric of the performance of speech 
recognition. Here the common problem is that the 
recognized word sequence can have a different length from 
the reference word sequence. 
Word error rate can then be calculated as: 
𝑊𝐸𝑅 =
𝑆𝑈𝐵 + 𝐷𝐸𝐿 + 𝐼𝑁𝑆
𝑁
 
Or 
𝑊𝐸𝑅 =
𝑆𝑈𝐵 + 𝐷𝐸𝐿 + 𝐼𝑁𝑆
𝑆𝑈𝐵 + 𝐷𝐸𝐿 + 𝐶𝑂𝑅
 
Where 
 SUB is the number of substitutions, 
 DEL is the number of deletions, 
 INS is the number of insertions, 
 COR is the number of the corrects, 
 N is the number of words in the reference 
(N=SUB+DEL+COR) 
When reporting the performance of a speech recognition 
system, sometimes word accuracy (WAcc) is used instead: 
𝑊𝐴𝑐𝑐 = 1 −𝑊𝐸𝑅 =
𝑁 − 𝑆𝑈𝐵 − 𝐷𝐸𝐿 − 𝐼𝑁𝑆
𝑁
=
𝐻 − 𝐼𝑁𝑆
𝑁
 
Where 
H is N-(SUB+DEL), the number of correctly recognized 
words. 
Sometimes recognition accuracy calculated as: 
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜.𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦 =
𝐶𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑙𝑦 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑠
× 100 
The Real Time Factor (RTF) is a common metric of 
measuring the speed of an automatic speech recognition 
system. It can also be used in other context where an audio 
or video signal is processed at nearly constant rate (e.g. 
reading music from a CD). It is calculated as: 
If it takes time Tp to process an input of duration Dr then 
𝑅𝑇𝐹 =
𝑇𝑝
𝐷𝑟
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
Speech is the fundamental, most effective, reliable and 
common medium to communicate in real time systems. 
There are so many applications of speech still to be far from 
reality just because of lack of efficient and reliable noise 
removal mechanism and techniques for preserving or 
improving the intelligibility for the speech signals. In this 
paper attempt has been stepped towards surveying the 
methodologies for soft computing based speech recognition 
techniques for speech enhancement in multimedia 
applications. Through this review it is found that 
beamforming technique used widely for performance 
improvement of speech recognition in multimedia 
applications. Also we can conclude that further to improve 
the performance of beamforming based speech recognition 
system, evolutionary computational algorithm (GA) 
optimization can be used in multimedia applications. 
Essentially, we also discussed the commonly used 
performance measuring parameters for speech recognition.
