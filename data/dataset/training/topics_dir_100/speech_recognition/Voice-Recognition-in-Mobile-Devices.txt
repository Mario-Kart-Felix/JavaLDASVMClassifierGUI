Voice Recognition and Commands - Background 
• Speech recognition (SR) is the translation of spoken words into text. It is also 
known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), computer speech recognition , 
speech to text (STT) 
 
• Speech recognition applications include voice user interfaces such as voice 
dialing, call routing (hands free communication), domotic appliance control, 
search (find a podcast where particular words were spoken), data entry 
(transcription), preparation of structured documents (radiology report), speech-
to-text processing (word processors or emails), and aircraft (Direct Voice 
Input) 
 
• Speech recognition systems made more than 10 years ago also faced a 
choice between discrete and continuous speech. It is much easier for the 
program to understand words when we speak them separately, with a distinct 
pause between each one. However, most users prefer to speak in a normal, 
conversational speed. Most modern systems are capable of understanding 
continuous speech. 
 
• This report looks at the patenting activity around voice control of mobile devices 
and also captures key litigations and NPE’s operating in this area. 
 
Search Strategy 
Using PatSeer as our database, we used the following search query to create our patent set. We searched within the US 
collection and restricted the search to Mobile Devices and to last 20 years.
