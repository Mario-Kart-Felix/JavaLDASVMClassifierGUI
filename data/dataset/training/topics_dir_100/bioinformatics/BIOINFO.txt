 
Bioinformatics Major 
www.biology.pitt.edu/undergraduate/academic-programs or http://cs.pitt.edu/undergrads/bioinformatics 
Revised: 09/2016 
 
Bioinformatics is the theory, application and development of computing tools to solve problems and create hypotheses in 
all areas of biological sciences. Biology in the post-genome world has and continues to be transformed from a largely 
laboratory-based science to one integrating experimental and information science. Bioinformatics provides biological 
tools that handle datasets too large and/or complex for manual analysis. Examples of some of these tools include 
assembly of DNA sequences of entire genomes, gene finding algorithms, microarray expression analysis, molecular 
system modeling, and biomarker discovery from mass spectra. Computational tools are central to the organization, 
analysis, and harvesting of biological data at the level of macromolecules, cells, and systems. Consequently, there is a 
growing need for trained professionals who understand the languages of both biology and computer science. 
 
The Bioinformatics major is operated jointly by the departments of biological sciences and computer science. This 
program offers training that builds a solid foundation in chemistry, biology, computer science, mathematics, and statistics. 
The training will enable students to communicate fluently with experts across these disciplines and to have the skills 
necessary to apply computing tools to address contemporary problems in biology and medicine. It will enhance the 
professional opportunities for undergraduates to pursue careers in pure or applied research in academia, government, 
pharmaceutical, medical, or biotechnology sectors.

* Taken as variable credits over multiple terms as early as 
sophomore year. Research must be approved by Kirk 
Pruhs or Paula Grabowski. 
Approved Elective courses (12 credits) 
Twelve credits chosen in statistics, chemistry, biological 
sciences, and/or computer science from the following 
courses. Students may take electives in other departments 
with approval. 
 
Biological Sciences 
Students may take as an elective: BIOSC 0370; BIOSC 
0390; or any 1000-level BIOSC course as an elective, 
excluding: BIOSC 1010; BIOSC 1690; BIOSC 1901; BIOSC 
1903; BIOSC 1904; BIOSC 1905; BOSC 1906; and BIOSC 
1907. 
 
BIOSC 1903 and BISOC 1904 count only toward the four 
research credits. They do not count as elective credits. 
 
If a BIOSC upper-level lab is used as ane elective, the 
prerequisite labs (BIOSC 005X and BIOSC 006X) will be 
counted for up to three credits. 
 
Chemistry 
CHEM 0250 Introduction to Analytical Chemistry 
CHEM 1410 Physical Chemistry 1 
CHEM 1420 Physical Chemistry 2 
CHEM 1460 Computational Drug Discovery 
 
Computer Science 
Any CS course at the 1500- or 1600-level 
 
Statistics 
STAT 1301 Statistical Packages 
STAT 1311 Applied Multivariate Analysis 
STAT 1321 Applied Time Series 
 
 
Course requirements 
 
Writing (W) requirement: Students must complete at 
least one W-course in the major. CS 1501 and CS 1510 are 
approved writing-intensive courses. 
 
Capstone experience: BIOSC 1640 and CS 1640 
satisfy the bioinformatics major capstone experience 
requirements for graduation. Capstone request must be 
made to Kirk Pruhs. 
 
Restrictions: Bioinformatics majors who have completed 
CS 0401 may not enroll in CS 0004, CS 0007 or CS 0110. 
BIOSC 1000 cannot be substituted for BIOSC 1810. CHEM 
1810 can only be substituted for BIOSC 1810 if it is not 
possible for the student to schedule BIOSC 1810. 
 
 
Grade requirements  
 
BIOSC courses: A grade of C (not C-) or better is 
required in each of the core and upper level courses that 
are to count toward the major. The elective courses for the 
major must also be completed with a grade of C or better. A 
minimum GPA of 2.0 in all departmental courses taken is 
required for graduation. If a C- or lower is earned in an 
elective course for the major but is not repeated, the course 
will be used to calculate the overall GPA but will not be 
counted toward the 32 credits required for the major. 
 
Co-Requisite courses: Students must also earn a 
minimum GPA of 2.0 in the co-requisite Chemistry and 
Mathematics courses.  
 
Related area: Due to its interdisciplinary nature, the 
Bioinformatics major does not require a related area. 
 
Satisfactory/No Credit option: No Bioinformatics 
major courses may be taken on an S/NC basis. 
 
Advising: Bioinformatics advising is available in both the 
Department of Biology and the Department of Computer 
Science. Bioinformatics majors must select an official 
advisor from either Computer Science or Biological 
Sciences.
