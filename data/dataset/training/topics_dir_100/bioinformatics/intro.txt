Introductory material
• What is Bioinformatics & why study it
• Brief overview of Bioinformatics
• Current hot topics
• Resources
(c) David Gilbert 2008 Bioinformatics module - Introduction 4
Why study this module?
• The course is about the application of techniques from
computer science to solve problems in molecular biology.
• An exciting area & relatively young field
• Pace of research driven by the large & rapidly increasing
amount of data being produced from the life sciences.
• Bioinformatics is not number-crunching for molecular
biologists, but is about the application of techniques from
computer science such as data abstraction, modelling,
simulation, machine learning and text mining to analyse
biological data.
• The applications include sequence analysis, the prediction
and analysis of protein structure and function, and the
simulation and analysis of biochemical systems.
(c) David Gilbert 2008 Bioinformatics module - Introduction 5
Why study this module?
• Includes the latest hot topics in the field, the focus of very exciting
research programmes in the University of Glasgow
• Systems Biology studies the relationships and interactions between
various parts of a biological system in order to understand how the
whole system functions.
•  Synthetic Biology  -  the structured engineering of biological systems
for useful purposes. We will look at the work of Glasgow's
undergraduate team which won the Environment and Sensor prize in
last summer's iGEM competition (head-to-head with MIT and Brown
University).
(c) David Gilbert 2008 Bioinformatics module - Introduction 6
Prior knowledge
• The course will focus on computing techniques - design of algorithms and
use of programmes and databases used to analyse, organise and display
biological data, rather than on biology.
• Specially designed for students who do not have training in the Life
Sciences: You do not need to have a biological background to do the
module - the course will give you the specific knowledge required.
• It will be supported by members of the Bioinformatics Research Centre,
who have backgrounds in biology, bioinformatics and computer science.
(c) David Gilbert 2008 Bioinformatics module - Introduction 7
Fun!
• A very practical course, where you will be able to put
your programming skills to practical use!
• Exploitation of parallelism: students will have access to
the Bioinformatics Computing Cluster which comprises
45 Sun X2200 servers each with 2 dual core processors
giving 180 CPU cores
(c) David Gilbert 2008 Bioinformatics module - Introduction 8
Module contents
• An introduction to the biological background to molecular
biology.
• Sequence analysis: algorithms, tools, techniques and
databases
• Basic probability theory for bioinformatics.
• Basic concepts of evolutionary theory and phylogenetic
analysis.
• Text mining and Information Retrieval for bioinformatics
• Some techniques for the representation and modelling
biochemical networks.
• Databases for bioinformatics
• Systems biology & Synthetic biology

How can we analyse the flood of data ?
Data: don't just store it, analyse it ! By comparing
sequences, one can find out about things like
• How organisms are related
& evolution
• How proteins function
• Population variability
• How diseases occur
(c) David Gilbert 2008 Bioinformatics module - Introduction 15
Bioinformatics (Computational Biology - USA)
• Bio - Molecular Biology
• Informatics - Computer Science
• Bioinformatics - the study of the application of
– molecular biology, computer science, artificial intelligence,
statistics and mathematics
– to model, organise, understand and discover interesting
information associated with the large scale molecular biology
databases,
– to guide assays for biological experiments.
• Systems Biology: modelling & analysis of biological systems
(“putting it all together…”)
