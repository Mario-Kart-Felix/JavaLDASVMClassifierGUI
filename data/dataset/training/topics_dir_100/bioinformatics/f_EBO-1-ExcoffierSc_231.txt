Introduction  
Most genetic studies on non-model organisms require a description of the pattern of diversity within and be-
tween populations, based on a variety of markers often including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences and 
microsatellites. The genetic data are processed to extract information on the mating system, the extent of popu-
lation subdivision, the past demography of the population, or on departure from selective neutrality at some 
loci. A series of computer packages have been developed in the last 10 years to assist researchers in performing 
basic population genetics analyses like Arlequin2 (Schneider et al. 2000), DNASP (Rozas et al. 2003), FSTAT 
(Goudet 1995), GENEPOP (Raymond and Rousset 1995b), or GENETIX (Belkhir et al. 2004). These programs 
have been widely used in the molecular ecology and conservation genetics community (Labate 2000; Luikart 
and England 1999; Schnabel et al. 1998). Among these, Arlequin is a very versatile (though not universal) pro-
gram, and complements the other programs listed above. It can handle several data types like RFLPs, DNA se-
quences, microsatellite data, allele frequencies, or standard multi-locus genotypes, while allowing the user to 
carry out the same types of analyses irrespective of the data types.  
We present here the version 3 of Arlequin with additional methods extending its capacities for the handling 
of unphased multi-locus genotypes and for the estimation of parameters of a spatial expansion. Note that these 
new developments are mainly implementations of new methodologies developed in our lab. We believe these 
methods will be useful to the research community, but we do not claim that alternative methods implemented 
by other groups in other programs are inadequate. A new graphical interface has been developed to provide a 
better integration of the different analyses into a common framework, and an easier exploration of the data by 
performing a wide variety of analyses with different settings. The tight coupling of Arlequin with the simula-
tion programs SIMCOAL2 (Laval and Excoffier 2004) and SPLATCHE (Currat et al. 2004) should also make 
it useful to describe patterns of genetic diversity under complex evolutionary scenarios.  
Methods implemented in Arlequin  
Arlequin provides methods to analyse patterns of genetic diversity within and between population samples.  
Intra-population methods

Abstract: Arlequin ver 3.0 is a software package integrating several basic and advanced methods for population genetics data analy-
sis, like the computation of standard genetic diversity indices, the estimation of allele and haplotype frequencies, tests of departure 
from linkage equilibrium, departure from selective neutrality and demographic equilibrium, estimation or parameters from past popu-
lation expansions, and thorough analyses of population subdivision under the AMOVA framework. Arlequin 3 introduces a com-
pletely new graphical interface written in C++, a more robust semantic analysis of input files, and two new methods: a Bayesian esti-
mation of gametic phase from multi-locus genotypes, and an estimation of the parameters of an instantaneous spatial expansion from 
DNA sequence polymorphism. Arlequin can handle several data types like DNA sequences, microsatellite data, or standard multi-
locus genotypes. A Windows version of the software is freely available on http://cmpg.unibe.ch/software/arlequin3.

ferent alleles, the heterozygosity, the base 
composition of DNA sequences, gene diver-
sity, or the population effective size Ne scaled 
by the mutation rate μ as θ=4Neu.  
• Maximum-likelihood estimation of allele and 
haplotype frequencies via the EM algorithm 
(Excoffier and Slatkin 1995).  
• Estimation of the gametic phase from multi-
locus genotypes via the Excoffier-Laval-
Balding (ELB) algorithm (Excoffier et al. 
2003).  
• Estimation of the parameters of a demographic 
(Rogers and Harpending 1992; Schneider and 
Excoffier 1999) or a spatial (Excoffier 2004; 
Ray et al. 2003) expansion, from the mismatch 
distribution computed on DNA sequences.  
• Calculation of several measures of linkage dis-
equilibrium (LD) like D, D', or r2 (Hedrick 
1987), and test of non-random association of 
alleles at different loci when the gametic phase 
is known (Weir 1996) or unknown (Slatkin 
and Excoffier 1996).  
• Exact test of departure from Hardy-Weinberg 
equilibrium (Guo and Thompson 1992).  
• Computation of Tajima’s D (Tajima 1989) and 
Fu's FS (Fu 1997) statistics, and test of their 
significance by coalescent simulations 
(Hudson 1990; Nordborg 2003) under the infi-
nite-site model.  
• Tests of selective neutrality under the infinite-
alleles model, like the Ewens-Watterson test 
(Slatkin 1996; Watterson 1978), and Chak-
raborty’s amalgamation test (Chakraborty 
1990).  
Inter-population methods 
• Search for shared haplotypes between popula-
tions  
• Analysis of population subdivision under the 
AMOVA framework (Excoffier 2003; Excof-
fier et al. 1992), with three hierarchical levels: 
genes within individuals, individuals within 
demes, demes within groups of demes. Com-
putation of F-statistics like the local inbreed-
ing coefficient FIS or the index of population 
differentiation FST.  
• Computation of genetic distances between 
populations related to the pairwise FST index 
(Gaggiotti and Excoffier 2000; Reynolds et al. 
1983; Slatkin 1995).  
• Exact test of population differentiation 
(Goudet et al. 1996; Raymond and Rousset 
1995a).  
• A simple assignment test of individual geno-
types to populations according to their likeli-
hood (Paetkau et al. 1997).  
• Computation of correlations or partial correla-
tions between a set of 2 or 3 distance matrices 
(Mantel test: Smouse et al. 1986)  
New features in Arlequin 3  
• Version 3 of Arlequin integrates the core com-
putational routines and the interface in a single 
program written in C++ for the Windows envi-
ronment. The interface has been entirely redes-
igned to provide better usability.  
• Incorporation of two new methods to estimate 
gametic phase and haplotype frequencies:  
◊ The ELB algorithm (Excoffier et al. 
2003) is a pseudo-Bayesian approach 
aiming at reconstructing the gametic 
phase of multi-locus genotypes, and the 
estimation of the haplotype frequencies 
are a by-product of this process. Phase 
updates are made on the basis of a win-
dow of neighbouring loci, and the win-
dow size varies according to the local 
level of linkage disequilibrium.  
◊ The EM zipper algorithm, which is an 
extension of the EM algorithm for esti-
mating haplotype frequencies (Excoffier 
and Slatkin 1995), aims at estimating the 
haplotype frequencies in unphased 
multi-locus genotypes. The estimation of 
the gametic phases are a by-product of 
this process. It proceeds by adding loci 
one at a time and progressively extend-
ing the length of the reconstructed haplo-

types. With this method, Arlequin does 
not need to build all possible genotypes 
for each individual like in the conven-
tional EM algorithm, but it only consid-
ers the genotypes whose sub-haplotypes 
have non-null estimated frequencies. It 
can thus handle a much larger number of 
polymorphic sites than the strict EM al-
gorithm. It also gives final haplotype fre-
quencies that often have a higher likeli-
hood than those estimated under the 
strict EM algorithm, due to the difficulty 
in exploring the space of all possible 
genotypes when the number of polymor-
phic loci in the sample is large. Note that 
this version of the EM algorithm is 
equivalent to that implemented in the 
SNPHAP program by David Clayton 
fully described on http://www-
gene.cimr.cam.ac.uk/clayton/software/sn
phap.txt, and whose efficiency for infer-
ring gametic phase has been favorably 
evaluated (Adkins 2004).  
• Estimation of the parameters of a spatial ex-
pansion (age of the expansion and deme size 
scaled by the mutation rate, as well as the 
number of migrants exchanged between 
neighbouring demes) from the patterns of 
polymorphism in a sample of DNA sequences. 
The estimation is based on a simple model of 
instantaneous and infinite range expansion, 
where some time ago, a single deme instanta-
neously colonized an infinite number of demes 
subsequently interconnected by migration (as 
under an infinite-island model) (Excoffier 
2004). The parameters are obtained by a least-
square approach maximizing the fit between 
the observed and expected distribution of pair-
wise differences (the mismatch distribution) 
computed on DNA sequences. Confidence in-
tervals of the estimates are obtained under a 
parametric bootstrap approach involving the 
simulation of an instantaneous expansion un-
der a coalescent framework.  
• Estimation of confidence intervals for F-
statistics estimated under the AMOVA frame-
work by bootstrapping over loci for multi-
locus data. A minimum of 8 loci are necessary 
for the computation of these confidence inter-
vals.  
• A completely rewritten and more robust input 
file parsing procedure, giving more precise 
information on the location of potential syntax 
and format errors in input files.  
• Use of the ELB algorithm described above to 
generate samples of phased multi-locus geno-
types, which allows one to analyse unphased 
multi-locus genotype data as if the phase was 
known. The phased data sets are output in Ar-
lequin projects that can be analysed in a batch 
mode to obtain the distribution of statistics 
taking phase uncertainty into account.  
• New output files fully compatible with modern 
web browsers.
