Study Plan for Postgraduate Program in Computer Science and Engineering 
 
The study plan was confirmed by the Faculty Board of IT University 2008-03-11.  
  
1. Subject Matter and Goals 
The aim of postgraduate education in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering is to 
give the student fundamental understanding of the various areas of computer science and 
engineering, and a broad understanding of current research issues and practical applications, with 
in-depth insight into one or more fields, and skills in research methodology. The licentiate 
program aims to make the student capable of independent participation in research and 
development work. The PhD program aims to make the student capable of critically and 
independently planning, carrying out, and presenting work in research and development.  
 
1.1 Fields of Specialisation 
The Graduate Education can be in Computer Science and Engineering with one of the following 
optional specialisations: 
 
• Bioinformatics 
• Computer Engineering 
• Computing Science 
  
• Language Technology 
• Software Engineering 
• Telecommunication 
 
2. Prerequisite Qualifications and Knowledge 
The basic qualification for admission to our postgraduate programs is a master's degree in 
computer science or engineering or in a related subject (“filosofie magister” or "civilingenjör”) 
including the master thesis, 15 higher education credits.  Equivalent knowledge acquired by other 
means will also count as qualification.  
 
3. Organization and Structure 
The PhD program comprises 240 higher education credits, and the licentiate program 120 higher 
education credits. These correspond to 4 years and 2 years respectively of full time study. Both 
programs consist of: 
• preparatory courses (if necessary) 
• general courses  
• individual study  
• participation in research seminars and guest lectures 
• research or development leading to a scientific dissertation 
Teaching is by supervision, lectures, and seminars. Lectures are offered mainly as part of the basic 
courses. The student participates in scientific activities through attendance at seminars and guest 
lectures even if these are not directly related to any part of the formal course. 
 
4. Courses 
 
4.1. Preparatory Courses 
These courses ensure a solid background in fundamental areas of computing science and help the 
student choose an area of specialization for the dissertation. If equivalent knowledge was acquired 
during undergraduate studies, then these courses are not necessary. Which courses to take, and 
how many, is determined by the student together with the supervisor and examiner. The credits 
earned in these courses are not part of the mandatory course points for a licentiate (30 higher 
education credits), respectively, for a PhD (60 higher education credits). 
 
4.2. General Courses 
The student must complete at least 12 higher education credits through regular graduate courses 
for a licentiate and at least 24 higher education credits for a PhD. Graduate courses offered by 
other departments at Gothenburg University may be counted towards this requirement, provided 
that they cover topics relevant to Computer Science and Engineering.  
 
4.3. Individual Study 
The examiner and the supervisor together with the graduate student determine individual study 
courses amounting to at least 12 higher education credits for the licentiate and and to at least 30 
higher education credits for a PhD. These courses may include graduate courses given at 
University of Gothenburg or elsewhere. Undergraduate courses may also be taken provided that 
 2(4)  
the examiner approves. To take an undergraduate course, the graduate student must apply to the 
responsible teacher before the course begins.  
4.4. Overview of Course Requirements 
The course requirements of the previous subsections summarized in tabular form: 
 
 Lic PhD
General Courses 12 24
Individual Study 18 36
Total Course Requirements 30 60
 
 
5. Dissertation 
5.1. Licentiate Thesis 
For the licentiate degree, the student must carry out independent work, write a thesis describing 
this work, and present the thesis at a seminar. The thesis is graded Passed ("Godkänd") or Not 
passed ("Underkänd"). 
 
5.2. Doctoral Dissertation 
For the PhD degree the student must write a scientific (doctoral) dissertation, and defend it at a 
public examination. The dissertation should have the quality required for publication in its entirety 
or in summary in a scientific journal of high reputation. It is graded Passed ("Godkänd") or Not 
passed ("Underkänd"). The grade takes into account the content as well as the defence of the 
dissertation. 
 
6. Requirements for the Degree 
6.1. Licentiate Degree 
The requirements for the licentiate degree comprise 120 higher education credits, of which 30-45 
higher education credits are acquired in postgraduate courses and 75-90 higher education credits in 
the licentiate thesis.  
 
6.2. Doctoral Degree 
The requirements for the doctoral degree comprise 240 higher education credits, of which 60-90 
higher education credits are acquired in postgraduate courses, and 150-180 higher education 
credits in the PhD thesis.  
 
7. Supervision 
Postgraduate students are entitled to supervision: full time students to four years of supervision for 
the doctoral degree, and to two years for the licentiate degree; part time students obtain the same 
amount distributed over a proportionally longer time period. The prefect of the department 
appoints an examiner who, together with the supervisor, determines the individual study courses. 
The examiner fixes the grade at the examination. It should be avoided that examiner and 
supervisor are the same person whenever there are enough active researchers in the subject of the 
thesis. In the beginning of the studies, the examiner, the supervisor, and the student together work 
out an individual study plan for the student's path of education. Each student has a follow-up 
group which comprises in addition to the supervisor at least two further persons, usually within the 
subject of the dissertation. This committee meets the student at least once per year to discuss 
progress towards the degree. After each follow-up meeting, an annual progress report signed by 
the student and supervisor is handed to the director of graduate studies. 
 3(4)  
8. Examination of Knowledge 
Courses are followed by written and/or oral examinations; the student's performance is graded 
Passed ("Godkänd") or Not passed ("Underkänd"). A licentiate thesis is graded by the examiner. A 
doctoral dissertation is graded by a committee, which is specially appointed for each thesis 
defence. Three months before the planned date of defence a draft of the dissertation must be given 
to the department’s vice prefect for Postgraduate education and to the members of the student's 
advisory committee.  
9. Further Directives 
With full time study, a doctoral degree is normally calculated to take four years, and a licentiate 
degree two years. The student must present his or her study results and future plans regularly.
