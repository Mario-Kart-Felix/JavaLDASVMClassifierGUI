DAVID bioinformatics resources consists of an integrated biological knowledgebase and analytic tools aimed at systematically
extracting biological meaning from large gene/protein lists. This protocol explains how to use DAVID, a high-throughput and
integrated data-mining environment, to analyze gene lists derived from high-throughput genomic experiments. The procedure first
requires uploading a gene list containing any number of common gene identifiers followed by analysis using one or more text and
pathway-mining tools such as gene functional classification, functional annotation chart or clustering and functional annotation
table. By following this protocol, investigators are able to gain an in-depth understanding of the biological themes in lists of genes
that are enriched in genome-scale studies.
INTRODUCTION
High-throughput genomic, proteomic and bioinformatics
scanning approaches, such as expression microarray, promoter micro-
array, proteomic data and ChIP-on-CHIPs, provide significant
capabilities to study a large variety of biological mechanisms,
including associations with diseases. These technologies usually
result in a large ‘interesting’ gene list (ranging in size from hundreds
to thousands of genes) involved in studied biological conditions.
Data analysis of the large gene lists is a very important downstream
task following the above example of high-throughput technologies
to understand the biological meaning of the output gene lists. The
data analysis of such highly complex and large volume data sets is a
challenging task, which requires support from special bioinfor-
matics software packages. In this protocol, we introduce DAVID
(the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discov-
ery) bioinformatics resources1,2, which is able to extract biological
features/meaning associated with large gene lists. DAVID is able to
handle any type of gene list, no matter which genomic platform or
software package generated them.
DAVID, released in 2003 (refs. 2,3), as well as a number of other
similar publicly available tools, including, but not limited to,
GoMiner4, GOstat5, Onto-express6, GoToolBox7, FatiGO8, GFIN-
Der9, GOBar10 and GSEA11 (see Supplementary Data 1 for a
complete list), address various aspects of the challenge of function-
ally analyzing large gene lists. Although each tool has distinct
features and strengths, as reviewed by Khatri et al.12, they all
adopt a common core strategy to systematically map a large
number of interesting genes in a list to the associated biological
annotation (e.g., gene ontology terms), and then statistically high-
light the most overrepresented (enriched) biological annotation
out of thousands of linked terms and contents. Enrichment analysis
is a promising strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators
to identify biological processes most pertinent to the biological
phenomena under study.
The analysis of large gene lists is indeed more of an exploratory,
computational procedure rather than a purely statistical solution.
As compared with other similar services, DAVID provides some
unique features and capabilities, such as an integrated and
expanded back-end annotation database13, advanced modular
enrichment algorithms14 and powerful exploratory ability in an
integrated data-mining environment1. Even though users can learn
more in-depth information about DAVID algorithms in our
original publications1–3,13–15, we now briefly summarize the ratio-
nale regarding the key DAVID modules, as well as the analytic
limitations (see Table 1 for comparisons of DAVID’s analytical
modules), so that readers may be able to quickly follow the
protocol.
Large gene lists ready for functional analysis by DAVID
In this protocol, we use a previously published gene list16 (Supple-
mentary Data 2) as an example to illustrate the results obtained
from the various DAVID analytic modules. To obtain this list,
freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were treated
with an HIV envelope protein (gp120) and genome-wide gene
expression changes were observed using Affymetrix U95A micro-
array chips16. The aim of the experiment was to investigate cellular
responses to viral envelope protein infection, which may help in
understanding the mechanisms for HIV replication in resting or
suboptimally activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
The quality of large gene lists derived from high-throughput
biological studies is one of the most important foundations that
directly influence the success of the following functional analysis in
DAVID. Owing to the complexity of the data-mining situations
involved in biological studies, there is no good systematic way, at
present, to quantitatively estimate the quality of the gene list ahead
of time (i.e., before the gene functional analysis). However, on the
basis of real-life data analysis experiences during the past several
years, a ‘good’ gene list may exhibit most, if not all, of the following
characteristics:
(1) Contains many important genes (marker genes) as expected
for given study (e.g., IL8, CCL4 and TNFSF8 from the example
gene list in Supplementary Data 2).
(2) Reasonable number of genes ranging from hundreds to thou-
sands (e.g., 100–2,000 genes), not extremely low or high.
(3) Most of the genes significantly pass the statistical threshold for
selection (e.g., selecting genes by comparing gene expression
between control and experimental cells with t-test statistics:

fold changes Z2 and P-values r0.05). Importantly, statistical
thresholds do not have to be sacrificed (e.g., fold changes Z1.1
and P-value r0.2) to reach a comfortable gene size.
(4) Notable portion of up- or downregulated genes are involved in
certain interesting biological processes, rather than being
randomly spread throughout all possible biological processes.

PROTOCOL
(5) A ‘good’ gene list should consistently contain more enriched
biology than that of a random list in the same size range during
analysis in DAVID (see Supplementary Data 3 for detailed
discussions).
(6) High reproducibility (e.g., by independent experiments under
the same conditions or by leave-one-out statistical test) to
generate a similar gene list under the same conditions.
(7) The high quality of the high-throughput data can be confirmed
by other independent wet lab tests or experiments.
Some of these points (2, 3, 6 and 7) come from upstream analysis,
whereas DAVID may help in examining others (1, 4 and 5).
Moreover, for enrichment analysis, in general, a larger gene list
can have higher statistical power resulting in a higher sensitivity
(more significant P-values) to slightly enriched terms, as well as to
more specific terms. Otherwise, the sensitivity is decreased toward
largely enriched terms and broader/general terms. Although the
size of the gene list influences (in a nonlinear way) the absolute
enrichment P-values, which makes it difficult to directly compare
the absolute enrichment P-values across gene lists, the enrichment
P-values are fairly comparable within the same or same size of gene
list. In addition, when different sizes of gene lists are generated from
the same data set with different threshold stringencies (within a
reasonable range), the absolute enrichment P-values may vary from
list to list. However, the relative rank/order of the enriched terms
may remain fairly stable, which will lead to consistent global
conclusions of functional annotations across the different sizes of
gene lists derived from the same data set (data not shown). This
kind of reproducibility and consistency should be expected using
DAVID tools if the underlying high-throughput biological studies
are robust.
Interestingly, we found that many gene lists input to DAVID are
in the size range of 1–10 genes. The enrichment statistic’s power
will be very limited in such extreme cases. However, the unique
exploratory capability of DAVID could still be very powerful for
analyzing such small gene lists. As the analysis is most likely in a
very focused and small scope, analysts may take advantage of the
unique exploratory capability of DAVID to navigate through all of
the well-organized heterogeneous annotation contents around the
focused genes regardless of the statistics.
Submission of user’s gene identifiers to DAVID
Comprehensively mapping of a user’s gene identifiers (gene IDs) to
the relevant biological annotation in the DAVID database is an
essential foundation for the success of any high-throughput gene
functional analysis. Gene IDs and biological annotations are highly
redundant within the vast array of public databases. The DAVID
knowledgebase13 was designed to collect and integrate diverse gene
identifiers as well as more than 40 well-known publicly available
annotation categories (Supplementary Data 4), which are then
centralized by internal DAVID identifiers in a nonredundant
manner. The wide range of biological annotation coverage and
the nonredundant integration of gene IDs in the DAVID know-
ledgebase enables a user’s gene ID to be mapped across the entire
database, thus providing comprehensive coverage of gene-asso-
ciated annotation. If a significant portion (Z20%) of input gene
IDs fail to be mapped to an internal DAVID ID, a specially designed
module, the DAVID Gene ID Conversion Tool15, will start up to
help map such IDs.
Principle of ‘gene population background’ in enrichment
analysis
The principle foundation of enrichment analysis is that if a
biological process is abnormal in a given study, the co-functioning
genes should have a higher potential (enriched) to be selected as a
relevant group by the high-throughput screening technologies. To
decide the degree of enrichment, a certain background must be set
up to perform the comparison (also see Step 1 in Table 2). For
example, 10% of the user’s genes are kinases versus 1% of the genes
in the human genome (this is the gene population background)
that are kinases. The enrichment can therefore be quantitatively
measured by some common and well-known statistical methods,
including w2, Fisher’s exact test, Binomial probability and Hyper-
geometric distribution. Thus, a conclusion may be obtained for the
particular example, that is, kinases are enriched in the user’s study,
and therefore have important functions in the study. However, we
cannot make such a conclusion with 10% alone, without compar-
ing it with the background information (i.e., 1%).
In this sense, the background is one of the critical factors that
impact the conclusion to a certain degree, particularly when two
ratios are close. There are many ways to set the backgrounds, e.g., all
genome genes; genes on an Affymetrix chip; and a subset of genome
genes that the user used in their study. In general, larger back-
grounds, e.g., the total genes in the genome as a population
background, intend to give more significant P-values, as compared
with a narrowed-down set of genes as a population background,
such as genes existing only on a microarray. Even though there is no
gold standard for the population background, a general guideline is
to set up the population background as the pool of genes that have
a chance to be selected for the studied annotation category in the
scope of the users’ particular study.
One of the advantages of DAVID is its flexibility of setting
different population backgrounds to meet different situations.
DAVID has an automatic procedure to ‘guess’ the background as
the global set of genes in the genome on the basis of the user’s
uploaded gene list. Thus, in a regular situation, users do not have to
set up a population background by themselves. We found that it
works generally well just because most of the studies analyzed by
DAVID are genome-wide or close to genome-wide studies. More-
over, other options are also available for user’s choices, including all
genes in the studied genome, genes in various microarray chips and
most importantly any gene set that users define and upload. The
last feature requires significant computational power so that it is
rarely found in similar Web-based applications. In summary,
various settings and options for population backgrounds can
meet the range of needs of general users to those of power users.
DAVID gene name batch viewer
Gene IDs, such as Entrez Gene 3558, typically do not convey
biological meaning in and of itself. The gene name batch viewer1
is able to quickly attach meaning to a list of gene IDs by rapidly
translating them into their corresponding gene names (Fig. 1, and
see slide 4 of Supplementary Data 5 for more detail). Thus,
before proceeding to analysis with other more comprehensive
analytic tools, investigators can quickly glance at the gene
names to further gain insight about their study and to answer
questions such as, ‘Does my gene list contain important
genes relevant to the study?’. In addition, a set of hyperlinks

1 Submission of
User’s Gene IDs
Background genes (or called
population genes)
To decide the degree of enrichment, a
certain background must be set up to be
compared with the user’s gene list. For
example, 10% of user’s genes are kinases
versus 1% of genes in human genome (this
is population background) are kinases.
Thus, the conclusion is obvious in the
particular example that the user’s study is
highly related to kinase. However, 10%
itself alone cannot provide such a con-
clusion without comparing it with the
background information
A general guideline is to set up the reference
background as the pool of genes that have a
chance to be selected for the studied annotation
category under the scope of users’ particular
study
Default background is the entire genome-wide
genes of the species matching the user’s input
IDs. Prebuilt backgrounds, such as genes in
Affymetrix chips and so on, are available for the
user’s choice
In principle, a larger gene background tends to
give smaller P-values. As most of the high-
throughput studies are, or at least are close to,
genome-wide scope, the default background is
good for regular cases in general
4 Gene Functional
Classification1,14
Classification stringency To control the behavior of DAVID Fuzzy
clustering
A general guideline is to choose higher strin-
gency settings for tight, clean and smaller
numbers of clusters; otherwise, lower for loose,
broader and larger numbers of clusters
Default setting is medium
Five predefined levels from lowest to highest for
user’s choices
Users may want to play with different stringency
for more satisfactory results
Enrichment score (for each
group)
To rank overall importance (enrichment) of
gene groups. It is the geometric mean of
all the enrichment P-values (EASE scores)
for each annotation term associated with
the gene members in the group. To
emphasize that the geometric mean is
a relative score instead of an absolute
P-value, minus log transformation is
applied on the average P-values
A higher score for a group indicates that the gene
members in the group are involved in more
important (enriched) terms in a given study;
therefore, more attention should go to them
Enrichment score of 1.3 is equivalent to non-log
scale 0.05. Thus, more attention should be given
to groups with scores Z1.3
However, the gene groups with lower scores
could be potentially interesting and should be
explored as well, if possible
6 Functional Anno-
tation Chart1,2
P-value (or called EASE score) To examine the significance of gene–term
enrichment with a modified Fisher’s exact
test (EASE score). For example, 10% of
user’s genes are kinases versus 1% of genes
in human genome (this is population
background) are kinases. Thus, the EASE
score is o0.05, which suggests that
kinases are significantly more enriched
than random chance in the study for this
particular example
The smaller the P-values, the more significant
they are
Default cutoff is 0.1
Users could set different levels of cutoff through
option panel on the top of result page.
Owing to the complexity of biological data
mining of this type, P-values are suggested to be
treated as score systems, i.e., suggesting roles
rather than decision-making roles. Users them-
selves should play critical roles in judging ‘are
the results making sense or not for expected
biology’
Benjamini To globally correct enrichment P-values to
control family-wide false discovery rate
under certain rate (e.g., r0.05). It is one
of the multiple testing correction techni-
ques (Bonferroni, Benjamini and FDR)
provided by DAVID
More terms examined, more conservative the
corrections are. As a result, all the P-values get
larger
It is great if the interesting terms have signifi-
cant P-values after the corrections. But as the
multiple testing correction techniques are
known as conservative approaches, it could hurt
the sensitivity of discovery if overemphasizing
them. Users’ judgment could be critical as dis-

explore additional functional information about each gene.
DAVID gene functional classification
As the analysis proceeds, gene functional classification14 provides
the distinct ability for investigators to explore and view functionally
related genes together, as a unit, to concentrate on the larger
biological network rather than at the level of an individual gene.
In fact, the majority of cofunctioning genes may have diversified
names so that genes cannot be simply classified into functional
groups according to their names. However, gene functional classi-

Fold enrichment To measure the magnitude of enrichment.
For example, 10% of user’s genes are
kinases versus 1% of genes in human
genome (this is population background)
are kinases. Thus, the fold enrichment is
tenfold. Fold enrichment along with EASE
score could rank the enriched terms in a
more comprehensive way
Fold enrichment 1.5 and above are suggested to
be considered as interesting
Fold enrichment and EASE score should always be
examined side by side. Terms with larger fold
enrichments and smaller may be interesting
Caution should be taken when big fold enrich-
ments are obtained from a small number of genes
(e.g., r3). This situation often happens to the
terms with a few genes (more specific terms) or
of smaller size (e.g., o100) of user’s input gene
list. In this case, the reliability is not as much as
those fold enrichment scores obtained from
larger numbers of genes
% Number of genes involved in given term is
divided by the total number of user’s input
genes, i.e., percentage of user’s input gene
hitting a given term. For example, 10% of
user’s genes hit ‘kinase activity’
It gives overall idea of gene distributions among
the terms
The higher percentage does not necessarily have
a good EASE score because it also depends on the
percentage of background genes as discussed in
the EASE score in Functional Annotation Chart

Classification stringency To control the behavior of DAVID Fuzzy

Default setting is medium
Five predefined levels from lowest to highest for

Users may want to play with different stringency
to obtain more satisfactory results
Enrichment score
(for each group)
To rank overall importance (enrichment) of
annotation term groups. It is the geo-
metric mean of all the enrichment P-values
(EASE scores) of each annotation term in
the group. To emphasize that the geo-
metric mean is a relative score instead of
an absolute P-value, minus log transfor-
mation is applied on the average P-values
A higher score for a group indicates that anno-
tation term members in the group are playing
more important (enriched) roles in given study;
therefore, pay more attention toward them
Enrichment score 1.3 is equivalent to non-log
scale 0.05. Thus, more attention should be given
to groups with scores Z1.3
However, the annotation groups with lower
scores could be potentially interesting, and
should be explored as well if possible
P-value (or called EASE score)
(for individual term members)
To examine the significance of gene–term

techniques, is able to classify input genes
into functionally related gene groups (or
classes) on the basis of their annotation
term co-occurrence rather than on gene
names. Condensing large gene lists into
biologically meaningful modules greatly
improves one’s ability to assimilate large
amounts of information and thus switches
functional annotation analysis from a gene-
centric analysis to a biological module-cen-
tric analysis (Fig. 2, and see slides 5 and 6 of
Supplementary Data 5 for more details).
Taken together with the ‘drill-down’ func-
tion associated with each biological module
and visualizations to view the relationships
between the many-genes-to-many-terms
associations, investigators are able to more
comprehensively understand how genes are
associated with each other and with the
functional annotation.
DAVID functional annotation chart
Functional annotation chart1–3 provides
typical gene–term enrichment (overrepre-
sented) analysis, which is also provided by
other similar tools, to identify the most
relevant (overrepresented) biological terms
associated with a given gene list (Fig. 3, and see slide 8 of
Supplementary Data 5 for more detail). Compared with other
similar enrichment analysis tools, the notable difference of this
function provided by DAVID is its extended annotation coverage13,
increasing from only GO in the original version of DAVID to
presently over 40 annotation categories, including GO terms,
protein–protein interactions, protein functional domains, disease
associations, bio-pathways, sequence features, homology, gene
functional summaries, gene tissue expres-
sion and literature (Supplementary Data
4). The annotation categories can be flex-
ibly included or excluded from the analysis
on the basis of a user’s choices (see slide 7 of
Supplementary Data 5). The enhanced
annotation coverage alone increases the
analytic power by allowing investigators to
analyze their genes from many different
biological aspects in a single space. In addi-
tion, to take full advantage of the well-
known KEGG and BioCarta pathways,
DAVID pathway viewer, which is accessed
by clicking on pathway links within the
chart report, can display genes from a
user’s list on pathway maps to facilitate
biological interpretation in a network
context (see slide 9 of Supplementary
Data 5). Finally, the choice of prebuilt or

PROTOCOL
user-defined gene population backgrounds
provides the user with the ability to tailor
the enrichment analysis to meet the user’s
specific analytic situation.
DAVID functional annotation clustering
Functional annotation clustering14 uses a
similar fuzzy clustering concept as functional
classification by measuring relationships
among the annotation terms on the basis of
the degree of their coassociation with genes
within the user’s list to cluster somewhat
heterogeneous, yet highly similar annotation
into functional annotation groups (Fig. 4, see
slide 10 of Supplementary Data 5 for more
detail). This reduces the burden of associat-
ing different terms associated with the similar
biological process, thus allowing the biologi-
cal interpretation to be more focused at the
‘biological module’ level. The 2D view tool is
also provided for examining the internal
relationships among the clustered terms
and genes (see slide 6 of Supplementary
Data 5). This type of grouping of functional annotation is able to
give a more insightful view of the relationships between annotation
categories and terms compared with the traditional linear list of
enriched terms, as highly related/redundant annotation terms may be
dispersed among hundreds, if not thousands, of other terms.
DAVID functional annotation table
Functional annotation table1,2 is a query engine for the DAVID
knowledgebase, without statistical calculations (Fig. 5, see slide 11
of Supplementary Data 5 for further details). For a given gene list,
the tool can quickly query corresponding annotation for each gene
and present them in a table format. Thus, users are able to explore
annotation in a gene-by-gene manner. This is a useful analytic
module particularly when users want to closely look at the
annotation of highly interesting genes.
Summary
Collectively, all of the DAVID analytic modules aim to extract
biological meaning from the given gene list from different biological
angles with highly consistent and expected results for a given study.
Integration of the results from the different analytic modules (Fig. 6)
will take advantage of the different focus and strength of each module,
to make the overall biological picture assembled on the basis of the
gene list, more comprehensive and detailed. For a given gene list,
DAVID bioinformatics resources is able to
help users to (Fig. 6b):

This article will mainly describe the proto-
col of how to use each DAVID analytic
module in a logical, sequential order, as
well as how to switch among the analytic
modules (Fig. 6). The example gene list
used in this protocol (also available as
demo list 2 on DAVID website) allows
new users to quickly test and experience
various functions provided by DAVID. The
protocol provides a routine analytic flow
for new users to begin, as well as the
flexibility for experienced users to use, the
modules in different combinations to bal-
ance the different focuses and strengths of
each module to better meet specific analy-
tical questions (Fig. 6). Moreover, Table 2
lists major statistical methods and filtering
parameters that may influence the DAVID
analysis and result interpretation in certain
ways, for users to quickly look up specific
statistical topics according to their interests.
MATERIALS
EQUIPMENT
A computer with high-speed Internet access and a Web browser.
EQUIPMENT SETUP
Hardware requirements and computer configurations DAVID is a Web-
based tool designed so that a computer with a standard Web browser using
default settings should work well. There is no need for special configuration
and installation. Although DAVID was tested with several combinations of
Internet browsers and operating systems, MS Internet Explorer or
Firefox in a Window XP operating system is recommended to obtain the most
satisfactory usability.
Input data A list of gene identifiers is the only required input for all DAVID
analytic modules or tools. The gene list may be derived from any type of high-
throughput genomic, computational or proteomic study, such as DNA expression
microarray, proteomics, CHIP-on-CHIP, SNP array, CHIP-sequence and so on.
The format of the gene list to be uploaded is described throughout the website and
is either one gene ID per line or a list of comma-delimited gene IDs in one line
(Supplementary Data 6). DAVID supports most common public gene identi-
fiers13 (see Supplementary Data 4). In addition, after the gene list is submitted to
DAVID, all DAVID analytic modules can access the present list from the gene list
manager so that there is no need to resubmit the gene list for each DAVID tool.

PROTOCOL
An example gene list derived from an HIV microarray study16 is used in this
protocol, as well as available as demo_list2 on DAVID website. The HIV
microarray study is briefly described in INTRODUCTION. More detail can
be found in the original publication16.
Result download All results derived from DAVID may be explored and visualized
on the Web browser. Moreover, all results generated by DAVID can be downloaded
in simple flat text formats, thereafter to be edited or plotted by other graphic tools,
e.g., MS Excel, for publication purposes as well as for archive purposes.
PROCEDURE
Submission of user’s gene IDs to DAVID
1| Submit a gene list to DAVID (Fig. 7, and see slide 2 of Supplementary Data 5 for further details). To do this, go to
http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov or http://david.niaid.nih.gov and click on ‘Start Analysis’ on the header. Use the gene list manager
panel that appears on the left side of the page (Fig. 7) and perform the following steps:
(A) Copy and paste a list of gene IDs into box A or load a text file containing gene IDs to box B (see more details regarding
format requirements in EQUIPMENT SETUP, and also see Supplementary Data 6).
(B) Select the appropriate gene identifier type for your input gene IDs (see more details of supported ID types in EQUIPMENT
SETUP).
(C) Indicate the list to be submitted as a gene list (i.e., genes to be analyzed) or as background genes (i.e., gene population
background).
(D) Click the ‘Submit List’ button.
! CAUTION It takes B30 s for a typical submission of B1,000 gene IDs; the progress bar, below the header, will disap-
pear after a successful submission and a gene list name should appear in the list manager box; if Z20% input gene IDs
cannot be recognized, the submission will be redirected to the DAVID Gene ID Conversion Tool15 for further diagnosis. By
default, the background is automatically set up as the genome-wide set of genes for the species that is found to have the
majority of genes in the user’s input list. However, it is always a good practice to double-check the default, or select a
more appropriate prebuilt background through the ‘background’ tab on top of the list manager.

? TROUBLESHOOTING
 TIMING
The total analysis time varies, ranging from several minutes to hours, and is dependent on the analytical questions being
addressed, the number of genes in the list being analyzed and the familiarity with the tools. It is not uncommon to make
several visits to focus on different questions regarding a gene list of interest. Indeed, computational time is only a small
portion of the total time, whereas exploring, interpreting and re-exploring both within DAVID and external to DAVID tends to
dominate most of the time. We used a PC computer with the Windows XP operating system, 2-GB memory, 2.0 GHz CPU and
1-Mbps Internet connection for the data analysis of a gene list consisting of B400 Affymetrix IDs (Supplementary Data 2)
derived from an HIV study16 (presented in ANTICIPATED RESULTS). During the analysis course, for regular functional calls, each
result was typically returned in B10 s. For the most computationally intensive functions, such as gene functional classification,
results were typically returned within B30 s; otherwise, never longer than 1 min.

your analysis by resubmitting your gene list
The size of the gene list is too small Enrichment or clustering algorithms are based on the

ANTICIPATED RESULTS
We use submission of the example gene list (B400 genes derived from an HIV microarray study16) to DAVID to illustrate the
results obtained from various DAVID analytic modules. More detailed information and the availability regarding the gene list can
be found in the Materials and Introduction sections of this protocol. Moreover, Supplementary Data 5 provides screen shots of
each major step of the following analysis.
Submission of user’s gene IDs to DAVID
A successful submission of the gene list to DAVID is shown in Figure 7 (also see slides 2 and 3 of Supplementary Data 5).
Users should see the progress bar under the header move through submission and disappear upon completion of the submission.
The gene list manager panel on the left side thereafter displays the list name (e.g., Upload_list_1) and corresponding species
information (Homo sapiens (391)). The number (i.e., 391) appended after the species information is the number of genes that
are recognized by DAVID. A set of hyperlinks on the right-side page lists the analytic modules available in the DAVID analytic
pipeline. Users may follow the order of the pipeline to conduct analysis or jointly use analytic modules in varying combinations
to meet the user’s specific needs (Fig. 6). Most importantly, the page serves as a central page (Fig. 7) for users to choose
analytic modules. Users may go back to this page at any time by clicking the ‘Start Analysis’ button on the header to switch
back and forth among analytic modules as needed.
Gene name batch viewer
The corresponding gene names of input gene IDs are displayed as shown in Figure 1 and slide 4 of Supplementary Data 5.
Users may explore the gene names to examine whether there are any interesting study or marker genes in the list. Many
immune-related genes, containing names like ‘interleukin’, ‘chemokine’, ‘kinase’ and ‘tumor necrosis factor’ can be found in the
example list, which are consistent with that reported in the publicaton16. A set of hyperlinks provided for each gene can further
lead to more detailed information about a given gene. In addition, by clicking on the ‘RG’ (related genes) search function
beside a gene name, e.g., ‘interleukin 8’, all other functionally related chemokine genes (e.g., cxcl 1, 2, 3, 4, 20) will be listed
so that users will be able to see other functionally similar genes in the list based on the bait gene.
Gene functional classification
The tool classified the example gene list (B400 genes) into ten functional groups in an easily readable tabular format. An
example output is illustrated in Figure 2 as well as in slide 5 of Supplementary Data 5. Gene groups (with significant
enrichment scores Z1), such as cytokines/chemokines (group 1: 3.39), kinases (group 2: 2.21), clathrin membrane fusion
genes (group 3: 1.86), transcription factors (group 6: 1.39) and so on, can easily be identified. All of these gene groups are
highly relevant to an HIV study and are therefore expected biological results16. Organizing the large gene list into gene groups
allows investigators to quickly focus on the overall major common biology associated with a gene group rather than one gene
at a time, thereby avoiding dilution of focus during the analysis due to too many single genes. Furthermore, the ‘2D View’
function associated with each group is able to display all related terms and genes in detail in one picture, to examine their
interrelationships. For example, for the kinase group (group 2), a user who is not familiar with kinases may explore the terms of
kinase activity, transferase activity, ATP-binding, nucleotide binding, protein metabolism, tyrosine specificity, serine/threonine
specificity, regulation of G protein signaling, signal transduction and so on in one view at the same time (slide 6 of
Supplementary Data 5). Therefore, we can quickly learn the biology for the kinase group, with the above-mentioned related
terms in a single view and also identify the fine differences among them. For example, there are two G-protein-coupled receptor
kinases, three protein tyrosine kinases and six kinases involved in cell surface receptor-linked signal transduction among the
23 kinases within the group. The fine details may be very important for pinpointing the key biology associated with a study.
Functional annotation chart
Over 500 enriched (overrepresented) biological terms were reported (Fig. 3, and slide 8 of Supplementary Data 5). Many of
them are highly immune related, such as response to pathogenic bacteria, chemokine activity, cell migration, clathrin-coated
vesicle membrane, kinase activity, RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity, cell communication. This is consistent with
observations identified earlier by the other analytic modules, as well as meeting the expectation for the HIV study16. The report
offers a lot of redundant details regarding the enriched biology associated with the gene list, which certainly helps the
interpretation of the biology, but also may dilute the focus. Moreover, a set of hyperlinks provided for each term will lead to
more details about each term, such as in-depth description, associated genes, other related terms, directed acyclic graph (DAG)
of GO and so on. Notably, the pathway viewer module offers visualization of users’ genes on enriched pathways. For example,
‘IL-10 Anti-inflammatory Signaling Pathway’ was reported in the output. We can observe that IL10 was activated as an upstream
immune regulator and was then further regulated by HO-1. As a result, the IL1/TNFa/IL6 complex was activated leading to
further downstream inflammatory responses (Fig. 8, and slide 9 of Supplementary Data 5). Thus, the interrelationship of input
genes was examined on the pathway in a network context.

Functional annotation clustering
The tool condensed the input gene list into smaller, much
more organized biological annotation modules in a similar
format (Fig. 4, and see slide 10 of Supplementary Data 5)
as that of gene annotation clustering, but in a term-centric
manner. Similarly, it allows investigators to focus on the
annotation group level by quickly organizing many redundant/
similar/hierarchical terms within the group. Annotation
clusters, such as immune response, transcriptional regulation,
chemokine activity, cytokine activity, kinase acitivity,
signaling transduction, cell death and so on, could be
found on the top of the output as expected for this study16.
The highly organized and simplified annotation results allow
users to quickly focus on the major biology at an annotation
cluster level instead of trying to derive the same conclusions
by putting together pieces that are scattered throughout a
list of hundreds of terms in a typical term-enrichment
analysis. In addition, the ‘G’ (genes) link provided for each
cluster can comprehensively pool all related genes from
different terms within the cluster. For example, each of the
seven terms within cluster 2 (inflammatory response cluster)
associates with both overlapping as well as differing
genes. Therefore, a pooled gene list brought together by cluster 2 regarding inflammatory response may be much more
comprehensive, compared with the genes selected from one or a few individual terms.

Figure 8 | Pathway map viewer. The red star indicates the associations
between pathway genes and the user’s input genes. Following the pathway flow,
IL10 was activated as an upstream immune stimulator. Then, the middle stream
gene, HO-1, was involved. IL-1/INFa/IL-6, as downstream regulator, was finally
activated. Thus, the user’s genes may be analyzed in a network context.
