As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses to their analysis, the issue of effective
genome annotation display becomes critical. A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested
portion of the genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is provided at
http://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag
alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms,
sequence-tagged sites, radiation hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text
and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of specific interest. Secondary links
from individual features lead to sequence details and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the
annotation tracks are computed at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence
data; collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom tracks to the browser for
educational or research purposes. The conceptual and technical framework of the browser, its underlying
MYSQL database, and overall use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to
over 3000 different users.
We are fortunate to live in a time when the vast majority of
the human genome has been sequenced, is freely available,
and where work proceeds rapidly to fill in the remaining gaps.
The public mapping and sequencing efforts have spanned a
decade and involved thousands of people (Consortium 2001;
McPherson et al. 2001). The end result of the sequencing ef-
forts will be three billion A’s, Cs, Gs, and Ts in a particular
order that somehow contains instructions for building a hu-
man body. Over 2.7 billion bases are in the public databases
today.
Finding which of the 2.7 billion bases are relevant to a
particular aspect of biology or medicine can be a challenge.
For the most part, researchers would prefer to view the ge-
nome at a higher level—at the level of an exon, a gene, a
chromosome band, or a biochemical pathway. The base-by-
base view is best reserved for preparing primers for experi-
ments or looking for DNA motifs associated with particular
functions. Interactive computer programs that can search and
display a genome at various levels are very useful tools, and a
number of these programs exist.
One of the earliest-such programs was a Caenorhabdi-
tis elegans database (ACEDB) (Eeckman and Durbin
1995; Kelley 2000). ACEDB began as a database to keep track of
C. elegans strains and information from genetic crosses (J. Thi-
erry-Mieg, pers. comm.). Soon ACEDB could display genetic
maps. ACEDB was adopted by the C. elegans sequencing
project at the Sanger Centre and Washington University
(Consortium 1998). As cosmid and then sequence maps of C.
elegans became available, these were added to ACEDB. ACEDB is
a very flexible program and has been used in many other
sequencing projects as well, including Arabidopsis and parts of
the human genome project. Because of its use of the middle
and right mouse buttons and other X-windows user interface
features, ACEDB works best on a Unix or Linux system. The
WormBase project (Stein et al. 2001) is actively adapting parts
of ACEDB for use in their web-based display.
The Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) at http://
genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/ was designed
with the web in mind. At SGD, it is possible to search for a
gene either by name or by sequence, browse neighboring
genes, retrieve the full sequence for a gene, look up functional
summaries of most genes, and link into the literature all with
a few clicks in a web browser. SGD was first described in 1998
(Cherry et al. 1998) and currently receives over 50,000 hits per
week from biomedical researchers.
There are currently at least three sites that attempt to
provide a similar service for the public working draft of the
human genome. The open source Ensembl project at www.
ensembl.org has been online since the very early days of the
working draft (Birney et al. 2001). Ensembl was conceived
before there were assemblies available of the draft human ge-
nome. Because the average size of the sequence contigs before
assembly was considerably smaller than the average size of a
human gene, initially Ensembl focused on identifying exons.
Ensembl ran the Genscan program (Burge and Karlin 1997) to
find genes in finished and draft clones. The contigs inside of
draft clones were ordered when possible by mRNA informa-
tion, but no attempt was made to merge overlapping clones.
Genscan is a sensitive program but has a relatively high false
rate of positive predictions. The putative exons Genscan
identified were translated into protein, and when homolo-
gous proteins could be found in the EMBL database, the exons
were marked as confirmed. When possible, exons were

grouped together into genes. Ensembl produced a web-based
display of their gene predictions and supporting evidence.
When the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) ge-
nome assemblies (Consortium 2001; Kent and Haussler 2001)
became available, Ensembl quickly shifted to them and over
time has added many additional annotations including Ge-
newise gene predictions (Birney and Durbin 1997), homology
with other species, positions of single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) (Sachidanandam et al. 2001), and so forth. En-
sembl recently has started to annotate the mouse genome as
well.
The National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) from the beginning has hosted the human genome as
part of the BLAST-searchable GenBank (Benson et al. 1999).
Inside GenBank, the genome is present as many separate re-
cords, mainly in records associated with bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) clones. NCBI made their own assembly of
the public human genome data available recently. Their as-
sembly can be BLAST searched, and the relative positions of
various features can be viewed on their map viewer. A page
with links to NCBI’s human genome-specific resources is at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/human/. These
resources include the RefSeq set of nonredundant mRNA se-
quences (Maglott et al. 2000; Pruitt and Maglott 2001). Func-
tional descriptions of many of the RefSeq genes are available
in the associated LocusLink and OMIM (Maglott et al. 2000;
Pruitt and Maglott 2001) databases.
A third site that serves the human genome is the focus of
this paper. The distinguishing features of the UCSC browser
are the breadth of annotations, speed, stability, extensibility,
and consistency of user interface. We actively seek data from
third parties to display. Each set of annotations is shown
graphically as a horizontal “track” over the genome sequence.
Currently, one-half of the 31 annotation tracks in the browser
are computed at UCSC while the other half are generated by
collaborators worldwide. The browser is highly integrated
with the BLAT sequence search tool (Kent 2002).
The UCSC browser had humble origins. The code origi-
nated with a small script in the C programming language,
which displayed a splicing diagram for a gene prediction from
the nematode C. elegans (Kent and Zahler 2000). This web-
based splicing display later acquired tracks for mRNA align-
ments and for homology with the related nematode Cae-
norhabditis briggsae. This was published as the tracks display at
http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/∼kent/intronerator (Kent and Zahler
2000a,b). It would have been difficult to move this browser to
the human genome before the draft assembly because of the
fragmented and redundant nature of the “Working Draft.”
Because the human genome is 30 times larger than the C.
elegans genome, even after the assembly, the software re-
quired substantial revision. In the end, we were able to main-
tain the same interactive response time we had on the worm
on the vastly larger human data set via a series of algorithmic
improvements, via use of the MySQL database, via a set of
Linux pentium-class machines acting as web servers, and via
systems tuning by our systems administrators. The result is a
site that has become very popular with biologists. Currently,
the UCSC Human Genome Browser at http://genome.
ucsc.edu receives >50,000 hits per working day, from more
than 3000 different users. In this paper, we describe the over-
all conceptual framework behind the browser and its use. We
explain some of the algorithmic tricks behind the browser,
demonstrate how to add your own tracks, and provide details
on how some of the tracks were generated at UCSC.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Using the Browser
To start a browser session, follow the “browser” link at http://
genome.ucsc.edu. This will take you to a page where you can
search for a gene by name, author, keyword, and so forth, or
directly specify the region to view as either a chromosome
band or a chromosome and range of bases. You can also enter
the browser via a search for homologous regions to a DNA or
protein sequence using the “BLAT” link. The BLAT search typi-
cally only takes a few seconds. The main browser display (Fig.
1) contains three main parts. On top is a series of controls for
searching and for zooming and scrolling across a chromo-
some. In the middle is a dynamically generated picture that
graphically displays genome annotations. On the bottom is
another series of controls that fine-tune the graphic display.
The browser represents annotations as a series of hori-
zontal tracks laid out over the genome. Each track displays a
particular type of annotation, such as Genscan gene predic-
tions, mRNA alignments, or interspersed repeats. Each track
can be displayed in dense mode, fully expanded, or can be
hidden. By default most tracks are displayed in dense mode
where they take up a single line. Clicking on a dense track
opens it up to a full mode, where there is a separate line for
each item. Clicking on an item brings up detailed information
on that item. Some particularly important tracks, such as the
track for known genes, are fully open by default. The track
display is useful at many scales, from a view of an entire chro-
mosome down to the alternative splicing patterns of a single
gene (Figs. 2–5). The notion of a track is important in the
underlying database as well as in the browser itself. The tracks
are relatively independent of each other both in the user in-
terface and the underlying programming. As a consequence,
it is very easy to add another track when new annotations
become available. The tracks relate to each other simply by all
being synchronized to the same underlying sequence. The
user can see many lines of evidence in a single screen and on
that basis quickly is able to make informed judgments about
the biology of a particular region.
The graphic display of the browser is invaluable for get-
ting a quick overview of a particular region in the genome and
for visually correlating various types of features. However,
there is a limit to what can be displayed in a single window.
As mentioned above, clicking on an individual item in a fully
opened track brings up further information on the track as a
whole and on the specific item. In many cases, this includes
links to other databases such as those at NCBI and Ensembl.
Figure 6 shows the details page for the known gene VLDLR
(the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor). It’s possible to re-
trieve the mRNA and protein sequence for this gene from this
page, as well as the genomic sequence with exons in upper
case.
At times, the user might want a list of features in a par-
ticular section of the genome in a text rather than a graphical
format. The Table Browser, which is accessible from the
“tables” link, extracts information in a tab-delimited format
suitable for import into text editors, spreadsheets, or your
own databases. The database behind both the graphical and
table browsers is described further in a later section.
Correlations Between Tracks
A common use of the browser is to look for evidence of pre-
viously unidentified genes. The EST, cross-species homology,

and ab initio gene prediction tracks in particular are very use-
ful for this purpose. Table 1A provides a summary of how well
these various tracks correlate with the RefSeq-based Known
Gene tracks across the entire genome and Table 1B provides a
summary of how well the various tracks correlate with the
Sanger Centre gene annotations on chromosome 22 (Dun-
ham et al. 1999). The Exofish track, based on homology with
the pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis (Roest Crollius et al. 2000)

quick access to BLAT searches, the DNA sequence, the annotations as text tables, earlier or later assemblies the genome, the corresponding NCBI
and Ensembl views, and the user’s guide. The controls directly beneath position the browser over a specific region in the genome. The large white
picture in the middle displays various annotations. At the bottom are controls for fine-tuning the display and for the individual tracks. Only the first
15 of 31 available tracks are shown here.
This region contains three known genes that are all transcribed on the reverse strand as indicated by the arrowheads in the introns. Note the
alternative splicing of HOXA1 in the Human RNA track. The Spliced EST track indicates that there is active transcription of a region between HOXA1
and HOXA2. Expressed sequence tag evidence for the presence of additional nonannotated genes in well studied regions like this often can be
found using the UCSC browser. The Mouse Blat track indicated a high level of conservation between mouse and human in this region. Both the
Mouse Blat and the Exofish ecores are based on translated alignments, but in highly conserved regions such as this it is not unusual for even
translated alignments to paint conserved noncoding regions. The noncoding regions have diverged considerably more between human and
pufferfish than between human and mouse.

is exceedingly specific, but covers less than half of bases in
known coding regions. This coverage will increase somewhat
as more pufferfish sequence is added. The Genscan track, on
the other hand, covers well over three-quarters of bases in
known coding regions, but has only moderate specificity. The
Ensembl, Fgenesh++ (Salamov and Solovyev 2000) and Genie
(Kulp et al. 1996, 1997) gene prediction tracks available in
some versions of the browser integrate ab initio gene-finding
techniques with homology evidence. Currently, there is no
gene prediction tool that integrates all of the evidence dis-
played in the browser into a definitive track. The genome
assembly and annotations found on the April 2001 version of
the browser were used for these tables.
Tracks Based on Human mRNA
There are several tracks based on alignments of human mRNA
sequences with the genome. All human mRNAs from the pri-
mate database in GenBank are used to make the Human
mRNA track. All human ESTs from dbEST in GenBank are
used to make the Human EST and Spliced EST tracks. In all
cases, the alignment is done with the BLAT program (Kent
2002) using the default nucleotide alignment parameters.
In many cases, a single mRNA will align in multiple
places in the draft human genome. This can be a result of
psuedogenes, genes that share a common domain, recent du-
plication events in the human genome, and assembly errors
in the draft. We filter the alignments to help focus on the
genes rather than the psuedogenes and paralogs. The first
filter is based on percentage identity. For ESTs, the threshold
is 93%. For mRNAs, the threshold is 96%. These thresholds
were chosen to be ∼2% below the mean error rate observed in
the first large-scale cDNA sequencing projects in the 1990s.
Because the error rate of modern cDNA projects is consider-
ably less, we are considering increasing these thresholds in
the future. Note that because exons frequently are missing
from the draft genome, the percentage identity is only calcu-
lated within the blocks that do align. The second filter is a
“near best in genome” filter. A score based largely on percent
identity is assigned to each alignment. The best-scoring align-
ment for each base of the mRNA sequence is recorded. Align-
ments that do not score within 1% of the best score for at least
20 bases in a row are filtered out. The combination of filters
reduces the number of alignments by fivefold to tenfold,
however most of the alignments eliminated are quite short
Figure 3 Chromosome 17 band q21.32. This region spans several million bases and is covered by a mix of finished and draft clones. The large
blocks in the gap track indicate gaps between clones, while the small ticks indicate gaps within draft clones. Where there is evidence for the relative
order and orientation of the contigs on either side of a gap, a white line is drawn though the gap. Most of the contigs in this region are ordered.
At this scale, it is possible to resolve most individual genes but not necessarily individual exons.
Figure 2 All of chromosome 17. Generally, people work at smaller scales than this, but the browser is capable of displaying all of the annotations
on a chromosome in a reasonable time. The centromere is depicted in red in the chromosome band track. The coverage track shows finished
regions in black and draft regions in various shades of gray depending on the depth of coverage. There are two large gene deserts in chromosome
bands q22 and q24.3. Tracks based on mRNAs, ESTs, and homology with Tetraodon all are quite sparse in these regions, though there is still quite
a bit of mouse homology.

involving repeat elements and short conserved motifs. Occa-
sionally, a nearly full-length alignment to a paralogous gene
also will be eliminated by these filters. The EST alignments
then are analyzed for signs of splicing, specifically for gaps of
at least 32 bases that have ends matching the GT/AG intron
consensus. These EST alignments then are selected to make
the spliced EST track.
Known Genes
The known gene track is created from human RefSeq mRNAs.
These are aligned with BLAT as above, but with more stringent
filtering. Because RefSeq mRNA sequences tend to be quite
clean, they are required to match at 98% identity, and the
near best in genome filter is set to pass only those within 0.2%
of the best alignment. The alignment then is turned into a
gene prediction by mapping the protein coding (CDS) portion
of the mRNA to the genome, and merging blocks in the align-
ment separated by gaps of five bases or less into exons. The
HUGO gene name, if any, is mapped to the gene prediction by
way of tables downloaded from NCBI. These same tables pro-
vide us with the raw materials to make hyperlinks into the
OMIM, RefSeq, and LocusLink (http://www.ncbi.nih.gov).
Tracks Based on Homology with Other Species
The browser has a number of tracks that show homology with
other species. Some of these are generated by third parties, as
detailed in the Acknowledgments section. The Mouse Blat,
Nonhuman mRNA, and Nonhuman EST are all generated at
Figure 5 A known gene and an unknown gene or two. ITGB3, the integrin  chain,  3 precursor is on the left. To the right is a relatively small
gene, C17001176, predicted by the Fgenesh++ program, which is supported by mouse and fish homology. Between ITGB3 and C17001176 is
a region quite likely to contain another gene judging by the EST and mouse homology evidence.
Figure 4 One million bases in the middle of 17q21.32. This is a scale frequently used when trying to positionally clone a gene. Many of the genes
in this region are already known, but the EST, mouse, and fish homology evidence suggest the presence of additional genes as well, particularly
between ITGB3 and NPEPPS.

UCSC using the BLAT program in translated mode using the
default score settings. The human genome was run through
RepeatMasker (Smit 1999; Jurka 2000) and Tandem Repeat
Finder (Benson 1999) before the alignments. The current
version of the Mouse Blat track is based on random whole
genome shotgun reads deposited in the NCBI/EBI trace ar-
chive by the Mouse Sequencing Consortium. There are ∼13
million of these reads covering the mouse genome to an
∼2.5 depth. The Nonhuman mRNA and ESTs are taken from
GenBank.
Gene Expression Tracks
In addition to the extensive nucleotide annotation available
in the browser, two new tracks present information about the
experimental behavior of mRNA transcripts as determined by
Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) and DNA microar-
rays.
The track incorporating SAGE data is the SAGE/UniGene
track, which presents data indicating the transcriptional level
of different UniGene clusters (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
UniGene/) from the SAGEMap project at the NCBI (Lal et al.
1999; Lash et al. 2000). In the browser window, the UniGene
clusters are represented by the alignment of the longest se-
quence in the cluster to the draft sequence using BLAT. The
clusters are colored by the average expression level of that
cluster over the different SAGE experiments. Clicking on a
UniGene cluster presents a summary table for individual
SAGE experimental results for each of the clusters in the cur-
rent browser window. From the details page, it is also possible
to view the SAGE results as a graph or to go directly to the
SAGEMap’s virtual northern page for that cluster.
The first tracks incorporating DNA microarray data are
the Rosetta tracks, which contain DNA probes for every pre-
dicted and confirmed exon on chromosome 22 as previously
described (Shoemaker et al. 2001). The predicted and con-
firmed exons are represented by separate tracks in the
browser. The same sequences that were used to select probes
are aligned to the draft genome using BLAT. In full mode,
these tracks present both the location of the exons in the
genome and a red and green banding pattern that corre-
sponds to the log ratio of expression in the 69 experiments
used. Clicking on an individual exon presents a more detailed
view of all of the exons present in the current browser win-
dow over all of the experiments. For each exon in each ex-
periment, the average log ratio of all of the probes in a par-
ticular experiment is presented as a red and green false color
display. If the actual intensities are of interest for a particular
experiment, these can be displayed graphically for each probe
in each exon in the browser window by filling out the form
presented.
Tracks Based on Genome-Wide Maps
High-level maps of the human genome existed for many years
prior to the existence of sequence-based maps (Caspersson et
al. 1968; Hudson et al. 1995; Dib et al. 1996; Broman et al.
1998; Deloukas et al. 1998; http://shgc-www.stanford.edu/
Mapping/TNGMAPS/). We have a Chromosome Band track
and a Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Clones track
that display information related to the cytogenetic map
(Trask 1999). There is also a Sequence-Tagged Site (STS) Mark-
ers track with data from genetic, radiation hybridization (RH),
and yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) maps.
The BAC Resource Consortium has identified the posi-
tions of several thousand BAC clones on the cytogenetic map
using FISH experiments (Cheung et al. 2001). We have deter-
mined the locations of these clones on the sequence assembly
in one of several ways. If the clone is fully sequenced and is
used in the construction of the assembled draft genome, its
location simply can be looked up. If both the BAC end se-
quences are known, they are aligned using BLAT and again
the position of the full extent of the clone can be determined.
For the remaining clones, if an STS is known to be contained
within the sequence or at least one of the end sequences is
available, the locations of these determined by BLAT are used
to approximate the location of the clone without giving the
exact boundaries. These clones and more information about
them can be seen on the FISH Clones track.
The locations of the FISH-mapped clones on the cytoge-
netic map and the sequence assembly are used to approximate
the boundaries of the chromosome bands at the 800-band
resolution. A dynamic programming algorithm developed at
UCSC determines these boundary locations by maximizing
the concordance between the chromosome band or bands
assigned by FISH experiments and that assigned to the region
of the sequence assembly where the clone has been placed.
Clones placed at NCI are weighted slightly more because of
the higher resolution FISH experiments being performed (Kir-
sch et al. 2000). Constraints have been implemented to en-
sure that the length of the predicted bands do not deviate too
substantially from the standard percentage lengths as set
forth by the International System for Human Cytogenetic No-
menclature (ISCN) (Mitelman 1995).
The STS Markers track displays the positions of markers
used in constructing the Genethon genetic map (Dib et al.
1996), Marshfield genetic map (Broman et al. 1998), White-
head Institute YAC map (Hudson et al. 1995), GeneMap99,
GB4, and G3 RH maps (Deloukas et al. 1998), Stanford TNG
RH map (http://shgc-www.stanford.edu/Mapping/

 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on June 29, 2017 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from 
al. 1995). Additional markers contained in the Homo sapiens
portion of the UniSTS database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/genome/sts/index.html) at NCBI also are contained in
this track. For many of these STS markers, the full sequence is
known, and we use BLAT to determine a location in the se-
quence assembly. For others, only the 3 and 5 primer se-
quences are known. In previous versions, we employed Greg
Schuler’s e-PCR program (Schuler 1998) to determine loca-
tions. We are now using BLAT for these placements as well.
Many markers are mapped to multiple locations equally well,
and only those with three or less placements are shown in the
browser. The details page for an individual marker on this
track gives additional information such as aliases, primer se-
quences, and locations on the maps mentioned above, as well
as links to UniSTS, GenBank, and GDB.
BAC End Sequence Pairs
BAC end sequences available from GenBank’s dbGSS division
are aligned to the genome sequence assembly using BLAT. The
alignments are searched for pairs that constitute the 5 and 3
end sequences for a single BAC clone. Those pairs for which
the end sequences are oriented correctly and that are at least
50 Kb but no more than 600 Kb apart are considered valid
pairs. These are displayed as the BAC End Pairs track. In the
full view, the orientation of the corresponding clone is shown
by arrows between the sequence pairs. The details page pro-
vides the accessions of the end sequences with links to Gen-
Bank and information on the alignment of the end sequences
to the assembly sequence.
Adding and Publishing Your Own Tracks
Since August 2001, it has become possible for users to upload
their own annotations for display in the browser. These an-
notations can be in the standard GFF format (http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/formats/GFF), or in some formats
designed specifically for the human genome project including
GTF, PSL, and BED. The formats are described in detail in the
web page http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/
customTrack.html. Note that the GFF and GTF files must be
tab delimited rather than space delimited. Uploaded annota-
tions can be seen only on the machine from which they were
uploaded and are only kept for 8 h after the last time they
were accessed.
It is possible to make custom tracks in a more permanent
and public fashion as well. To do this, the track provider puts
a file in one of the supported formats onto a web site. The URL
for this file can be pasted into the browser’s custom track
control. It also is possible to construct links from your own
web pages into the browser in such a way that the custom
track is automatically included. The following is an example
of such a link:

B—Chromosome 22 using Sanger Centre Annotations
The Covers column shows the percentage of the genome (A) or chromosome 22 (B) covered by a particular track. The Yield Tx column
describes the percentage of bases in the annotated gene transcripts (from known genes in RefSeq in A and the Sanger Centre annotated genes
in B) covered by the track, while the Yield Co column describes the percentage of the annotated protein coding regions covered. The Enrich
Tx and Enrich Co columns show how many times enriched the track is for transcribed and coding regions compared to the genome as a whole.
The yield columns correspond directly to sensitivity of the feature for detecting genes. Because the annotations, particularly the whole-genome
annotations, are incomplete, it is not possible to do traditional specificity calculations. However, the enrichment columns allow one to compare
the relative specificity of the tracks. The rows for the tracks RefSeq Tx (transcribed regions in RefSeq), RefSeq Co (coding regions in RefSeq),
Sanger Tx (transcribed regions for Sanger annotated genes), and Sanger Co (coding regions from Sanger annotated genes) are included to
show the maximum possible yields and enrichments for transcript and coding tracks.

The position specifies where the browser should open. The db
variable specifies the database version. It is always of the form
hgN, where N is incremented for each version. For the August
2001 version, the db variable is “hg8”. The customText con-
tains the URL for the custom track file. Tracks produced in
this method are not as fast as tracks loaded into the database
at UCSC, but if the size of the track file is less than 1 or 2 Mb,
the performance is usually very good.
The Challenge of Change—Keeping Up
with the Working Draft
One of the challenges of annotating the human genome is
that there are so many versions of it. At UCSC, we try to
assemble a new version approximately every three months to
incorporate new sequence. The chromosomal coordinates of
genes and other features change with each version. Occasion-
ally, a chunk of sequence will even get moved from one chro-
mosome to another as the map is refined. We have recently
put in a feature to help jump between the most recent three
versions. This feature is available from the “convert” button at
the top of the browser. It works by performing a BLAT search
on the first 1000, last 1000, and middle 1000 bases in the
current window. If all three searches land uniquely in the
same order on the other version, the program announces a
successful conversion. If the search results are not so straight-
forward, the user is given various options to find the corre-
sponding sequence. Frequently, if the feature the user is look-
ing for is tied to an mRNA, it is simplest just to BLAT the
mRNA.
The Database
The genome.ucsc.edu database is built on top of MySQL (ww-
w.mysql.com). We initially chose this database to be compat-
ible with the Ensembl project. MySQL has turned out to be
very well suited to our purposes. It is extremely efficient at
retrieving data from indexed files. We use MySQL as a “read-
mostly” database. We load the database in large batches and
the rest of the time treat it as read-only. Each of our seven web
servers has a copy of the database on local disk.
To create the graphical display, the browser queries
MySQL track by track, asking for data that overlaps the dis-
play window. The SQL query to fetch these data for the cpg-
Island track on a window covering from base 10,000 to base
20,000 on chromosome 3 is as follows:
select * from cpgIsland where chrom = “chr3” and chromStart
<20000 and chromEnd >10000
We created indices on chrom,chromStart and chrom,chro-
mEnd for this table. The query went reasonably fast for small
tables, such as the 29,005-item cpgIsland table. Even for rela-
tively small tables, sorting the data by chrom,chromStart be-
fore loading the database turned out to be critical for perfor-
mance. If the indices are small enough to fit into RAM, this
presorting reduces the number of disk seeks needed to load
the data from one track to a very small number, often to a
single seek.
For larger tables, such as the 4.2-million-item EST align-
ment table, more complicated schemes were needed for good
interactive performance. As a first step, we split such tables
between chromosomes so that the basic query becomes some-
thing like this:
select * from chr2_est where chromStart <20000 and chromEnd
>10000
This reduced the size of the indices by eliminating the need to
index the chromosome field, making it more likely for the
indices to fit into RAM. In general, the database had to scan
the index for half of the chromosome when the query was
formulated in this fashion. As a consequence, the browser was
slower on large chromosomes than on smaller ones. The per-
formance was still tolerable we felt (response time was typi-
cally <5 sec even on the largest chromosome), but as we added
more data, the performance degraded. When the large mouse
homology tables were added, it was clear that we needed a
more intelligent scheme.
We settled on a binning scheme suggested by Lincoln
Stein and Richard Durbin. A simple version of this scheme is
shown in Figure 7. In the browser itself, we use five different
sizes of bins: 128 kb, 1 Mb, 8 Mb, 64 Mb, and 512 Mb.
The query in the previous paragraph using this binning
scheme becomes:
select * from chr2_est where chromStart <20000 and chromEnd
>10000 and (bin = 1 or bin = 2 or bin = 10 or bin = 74 or
bin = 586)
Though the query itself is more complex than before, it ex-
ecutes much faster. Typically, almost all features are in the
smaller bins, and in the most common usage scenarios only
the contents of a few of these smaller bins need to be exam-
ined. This binning scheme is relatively simple to implement
and seems to have sufficient performance to meet our needs
indefinitely. A modest improvement we have yet to imple-
ment would be to stagger the bin boundaries so that small
features that happen to span the point at 64 Mb do not nec-
essarily end up in the largest bin, and similarly for other bin
boundaries that occur at multiple levels.
In addition to the tables that contain positional infor-
mation and that may be split between chromosomes and/or
binned as described above, there are nonpositional tables.
These contain auxiliary information that is not needed for the
graphical display, but which may be useful when examining
a particular feature in the details page. Some examples of non-
positional tables include the DNA sequence, author, cell type,
and library name of ESTs. At the time we designed the data-
base, file sizes on Linux machines were limited to 2
gigabases. Largely for this reason, most of the actual DNA data
are stored in external files. The external files are still indexed
through the database.
A detailed table-by-table and field-by-field description of
the database is at http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/
Figure 7 Binning scheme for optimizing database accesses for ge-
nomic annotations that cover a particular region of the genome. This
diagram shows bins of three different sizes. Features are put in the
smallest bin in which they fit. A feature covering the range indicated
by line A would go in bin 1. Similarly, line B goes in bin 4 and line C
in bin 20. When the browser needs to access features in a region, it
must look in bins of all different sizes. To access all the features that
overlapped or were enclosed by line A, the browser looks in bins 1, 2,
3, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. For B the browser looks in bins 1, 4, 14, 15, 16,
17. For C, the browser looks in bins 1, 5, and 20.
UCSC Human Genome Browser
Genome Research 1003
www.genome.org
 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press on June 29, 2017 - Published by genome.cshlp.orgDownloaded from 
gbdDescriptions.html. The entire database is dumped weekly
into tab-delimited files that can be downloaded either a table
at a time or as a single large zip file at genome.ucsc.edu. With
the Table Browser at http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/
hgText.html, it is possible to extract subsets of the database,
in many cases eliminating the need to set up your own copy
of the MySQL database.
Enhanced functions are provided for downloading DNA
sequence data itself. At any point while browsing, the user can
use the “DNA” link at the top of the browser to download the
genome sequence for the region currently being viewed. Basic
options include reverse complementation, upper/lower case,
and masking of repeats by RepeatMasker (Smit 1999; Jurka
2000), possibly using lower case. Here, the output is a simple
text file. Advanced options produce an HTML file containing
the sequence. These options allow users to use a variety of
combinations of case, underlining, bold, italic, and color to
represent one or more kinds of annotation on the genome
sequence. Any track of annotation that is available on the
browser can be represented in the sequence using any com-
bination of these representation modes. Multiple tracks of
annotation can be represented simultaneously in the se-
quence by choosing a different mode or combination of
modes for each track.
The Programming Interface Between the Database
and the Browser
There is a natural tension between how an object is repre-
sented in the database and in computer programs such as the
scripts that make up the browser. A program in the C lan-
guage typically will represent an object as a “struct” of some
sort and have a family of functions that operate on this struc-
ture. An object in a relational database may be represented as
a row in a table, as an entire table, or even as an abstract entity
spanning multiple tables that are joined together by an ap-
propriate SQL query at run time. Some programmers have
even resorted to converting their objects to some sort of com-
plex text format such as XML, and storing the object as a
“blob” in the database. A disadvantage of this last approach is
that it becomes difficult to index the fields of the object sepa-
rately.
In the browser database, we found a pragmatic compro-
mise that works very well for us. We have a program,
autoSql, which takes a data definition as an input. From this
definition, autoSql creates a C structure, a C function to load
the structure from an array of strings (which is how a MySQL
query returns a row in a table), a C function to save the struc-
ture as a line in a tab-separated file (which can be used to load
the database), a C function to free up the dynamic memory
used by the structure, and a SQL create statement. There is
thus a one-to-one correspondence between a structure in
memory and a row in a table on disk, and likewise a one-to-
one correspondence between the fields in structure in
memory and the fields in a row. The autoSql definitions can
include arrays and substructures. The arrays are represented in
the database as comma-separated lists stored as blobs. While
autoSql is capable of generating code to handle substruc-
tures, these also end up stored in blobs. Because blobs are
difficult to index, we have not actually used this feature in the
genome.ucsc.edu database, though arrays are fairly common.
See http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/∼kent/exe/doc/autoSql.doc for
more information on autoSql.
Most of the browser database also can be accessed via the
Distributed Annotation Service (DAS) protocol (Dowell et al.
2001). DAS is a rapidly evolving open source standard for
distributing genomic annotations over the web. It is similar in
function to the publishing-your-own tracks system we de-
scribe here, but the data is transmitted in an XML rather than
a tab-separated format. Further information on DAS can be
found at http://www.biodas.org. The web address of our DAS
server is http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/das. Because of the
large size of the annotations, particularly when represented in
DAS-GFF XML format, for best results, enable compression on
the DAS clients when accessing our DAS server.
Other Features
The UCSC browser is linked with the Ensembl human ge-
nome browser at http://www.ensembl.org in such a way that
users viewing any region of the genome at UCSC can switch
easily to viewing the same region in the Ensembl browser and
vice versa. Like the facility for user-published tracks described
above, this is another way the power of the web can be ex-
ploited to enrich the variety of information about a gene or
region of interest that is rapidly accessible to a user. Mirrors of
the UCSC browser in Europe and Asia provide faster access to
the information contained in the browser and its database to
researchers in these parts of the world and serve as redundant
sites for all users on occasions where a power outage or some
other exceptional condition puts genome.ucsc.edu tempo-
rarily off line. Because the browser runs on Linux with a
MySQL database, we are able to help academic and nonprofit
institutions set up mirror sites at no cost to the mirroring
institution. Finally, help and frequently-asked-questions
pages are available to assist users with features of the browser
and database that are not evident from self-exploration. This
information is supplemented by a moderated and archived
e-mail discussion group.
Conclusion
The web site at http://genome.ucsc.edu is a valuable tool for
exploring the human genome. It provides fast sequence and
text-based search facilities. The graphical display is relatively
simple to use yet quite powerful and is able to handle huge
annotation sets such as those describing human repeats or
human/mouse homologies smoothly. The underlying data-
base has a relatively simple yet robust design and can be ac-
cessed by many methods. It is possible for visitors to incor-
porate custom annotations in the context of the annotations
built into the browser either in a public or a private fashion.
In the coming years, we plan to continue adding to this site
and to adapt it to other genomes. We have already adapted it
to the mouse genome.
