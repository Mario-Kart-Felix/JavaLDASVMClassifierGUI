ABSTRACT
Motivation: DnaSP is a software package for a comprehensive
analysis of DNA polymorphism data. Version 5 implements a number
of new features and analytical methods allowing extensive DNA
polymorphism analyses on large datasets. Among other features,
the newly implemented methods allow for: (i) analyses on multiple
data files; (ii) haplotype phasing; (iii) analyses on insertion/deletion
polymorphism data; (iv) visualizing sliding window results integrated
with available genome annotations in the UCSC browser.

1 INTRODUCTION
The analysis of DNA polymorphisms is a powerful approach to
understand the evolutionary process and to establish the functional
significance of particular genomic regions (Begun et al., 2007;
Nielsen, 2005; Rosenberg and Nordborg, 2002). In this context,
estimating the impact of natural selection (both positive and
negative) is of major interest. Furthermore, DNA polymorphisms
are relevant as a tool for a broad range of life science disciplines.
Consequently, many high-throughput sequencing, genotyping and
polymorphism detection systems have been developed and are
currently publicly available (Shendure and Ji, 2008). These new
technologies are generating massive amounts of data that need to be
processed, analyzed and transformed effectively into knowledge.
These technological advances have largely stimulated the
development of both analytical methods and computer applications.
Population genetic methods, and particularly those based on
coalescent theory (Hudson, 1990; Wakeley, 2009), are used at
an increasing rate, but need to be adapted to the particularities
of the data (massive amounts of data, missing data, genotypes,
insertion/deletion (indels) polymorphisms, etc.). Furthermore, new
computer applications and algorithms need to be developed for
processing massive datasets (Excoffier and Heckel, 2006), and more
specifically computer visualization tools for the representation of
DNA variation patterns. DnaSP (DNA Sequence Polymorphism) is
a software package that allows for extensive DNA polymorphism
analyses using a friendly graphical user interface (GUI) (Rozas et al.,
2003). Version 5 extends the capabilities of the software, allowing

comprehensive DNA polymorphism analyses on multiple data files
and on large datasets. Altogether, the present version of DnaSP has
the appropriate features for exhaustive exploratory analyses using
high-throughput DNA polymorphism data.
2 FEATURES
DnaSP v5 incorporates major improvements. The new version
currently allows for the handling and analysis of multiple data files
in batch, and implements new algorithms and methods; among other
things (see below) includes a new module to identify conserved DNA
regions, this feature might be useful for phylogenetic footprinting-
based analyses (Vingron et al., 2009). DnaSP provides a convenient
GUI facilitating all data management and analytical tasks; the
results can be visualized graphically as well as in a text report.
DnaSP accepts multiple DNA sequence alignment file formats
(Rozas et al., 2003), including NEXUS (Maddison et al., 1997),
and HapMap3 files with phased haplotypes (The International
HapMap Consortium, 2003). The software allows exhaustive DNA
polymorphism analyses, including those based on coalescent theory
(Rozas et al., 2003; Wakeley, 2009).
2.1 Haplotype reconstruction
Haplotype reconstruction aims at resolving haplotype phase given
genotypic information. DnaSP implements statistical methods to
infer haplotype phase, and prepares adequately the phased data
for subsequent analyses. The input data (unphased genotype data)
are required in FASTA format using IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity
codes to represent heterozygous sites. DnaSP reconstructs the
phase by applying various algorithms (PHASE v2.1, fastPHASE
v1.1 and HAPAR) differing in the underlying population genetic
assumptions. PHASE (Stephens and Donnelly, 2003; Stephens et al.,
2001) assumes Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and uses a coalescent-
based Bayesian method to infer haplotypes. fastPHASE (Scheet and
Stephens, 2006) implements a modification of the PHASE algorithm
taking into account the patterns of linkage disequilibrium and its
gradual decline with physical distance. This algorithm is faster and
allows for the handling of larger datasets than PHASE, while being
slightly less accurate. HAPAR (Wang and Xu, 2003) infers haplotype
phase by maximum parsimony, i.e. attempts to find the minimum
number of haplotypes explaining the genotype sample.

2.2 Deletion/insertion polymorphisms
Deletion/insertion polymorphisms (DIPs) analysis can provide
insights into the evolutionary forces acting on DNA. This
information, however, has been rarely used. One obstacle has
been the difficulty of defining clearly homologous states (Young
and Healy, 2003). DnaSP incorporates an algorithm for treating
indels related to the ‘simple indel coding’ method of Simmons and
Ochoterena (2000). Specifically, only indels with the same 5′ and 3′
termini are considered homologous (resulted from a single event),
and indels of different lengths (even in the same position of the
alignment) are treated as different events. DnaSP, nevertheless, uses
a slightly different method for coding completely overlapping gaps,
and allows the user to choose the level of overlap to be coded.
Subsequently, DnaSP estimates a number of DIP summary statistics,
such as the average indel length, indel diversity, as well as Tajima’s
D (Tajima, 1989) based on indel information. Additionally, it exports
the recoded data in the NEXUS format file.
2.3 Analysis of multiple data files
DnaSP can automatically read and analyze multiple data files
sequentially (in batch mode). These data files may contain a varying
number of sequences (from within one species, or from one species
as well as one outgroup), or represent diverse genomic regions.
The program estimates the most common DNA polymorphism
and divergence summary statistics (such as the nucleotide and
haplotype diversity, the population mutation parameter, the number
of nucleotide substitutions per site, etc.), and neutrality tests (such
as Tajima’s, Fu and Li’s and Fu’s tests).
2.4 Sliding window results visualization
The sliding window technique is a useful tool for exploratory DNA
polymorphism data analysis (Hutter et al., 2006; Rozas et al.,
2003; Vilella et al., 2005). The current version of DnaSP permits
visualizing results of the sliding window (for example, nucleotide
diversity or Tajima’s D values along the DNA sequence) integrating
available genome annotations in the UCSC browser (Kent et al.,
2002). This feature can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the
results; for instance, it is possible to identify the relevant genome
annotations (genes, intergenic regions, conserved regions, etc.),
which are adjacent to regions with atypical patterns of nucleotide
variation.
3 IMPLEMENTATION
DnaSP version 5 has been developed in Microsoft Visual Basic
v6.0, C and C++, and it runs under Microsoft Windows operating
systems (2000/XP/Vista). With the use of Windows emulators,
DnaSP can also run on Apple Macintosh platforms, Linux and Unix-
based operating systems. The software has been tested in all three
platforms.
