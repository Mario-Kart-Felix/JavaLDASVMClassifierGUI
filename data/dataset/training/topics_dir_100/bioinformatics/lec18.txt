How can computers help cure cancer?
(computational biology and 
bioinforamtics)
Molecular biology 101 
or 
“why bother?”
Cells are 
fundamental 
working units 
of all 
organisms
Common descent of organisms implies 
that they will share many “basic 
technologies.”
Development of new adaptations in 
response to environmental 
pressure can lead to “specialized 
technologies.”
More recent divergence implies more 
shared technologies between 
species.
All of biology is about two things: 
understanding shared or 
unshared features.
Evolution is key!
Yeast are unicellular organisms
Humans are multi-cellular organisms
Understanding how a cell works is critical to understanding 
how the organism functions
Because of evolutionary similarities – we can use yeast and 
other small organisms to study human biology and disease!
Biological macromolecules
What are the main players in 
molecular biology?
What is DNA, RNA, protein, lipid?
Lipids
• Each lipid consists of 
a hydrophilic (water 
loving) and 
hydrophobic fragment
• Spontaneously form 
lipid bilayers => 
membranes
DNA
• Uses alphabet of 4 
letters {ATCG}, called 
bases
• Encodes genetic 
information in triplet 
code
• Structure: a double 
helix
Proteins
• A sequence of amino 
acids (alphabet of 20)
• Each amino acid 
encoded by 3 DNA 
bases
• Perform most of the 
actual work in the cell
• Fold into complex 3D 
structure

How does a cell function?
The “Central Dogma” of biology
How are proteins made?
What are translation & transcription?
How does a cell function?
Courtesy U.S. Department of Energy Genomes to Life program 
DNA is a sequence of 
bases {A, T, C, G}
TAT-CGT-AGT
Proteins consist of 
amino acids, whose 
sequence is encoded 
in DNA
Tyr-Arg-Ser
Each 3 bases of DNA 
encode 1 amino acid
So what con computer science do 
to help study biology?
Case study 1: 
sequencing the human genome
How is the genome sequenced?
We have a sequence – now what?
Where are the genes?
*start with “atg”
*go in triplets
*end with “act”
So how do we find them?
P53
how 
would 
you 
find 
this?
Where is this gene in the genome?
• Human genome is 3 billion bases long
• TP53 is on:
– Chromosone 17
– Small arm
– Position 17.3
– Around base 9.5 mil in chromosome 17 
(Human chromosomes range in length from 
51 million to 245 million base pairs )
• Could you find this by hand?
Need large databases for all the information!
So what con computer science do 
to help study biology?
Case study 2: 
so what do these genes do?
Common descent of 
organisms implies that 
they will share many 
“basic technologies.”
Thus, can use yeast to 
understand what 
proteins do in humans!
Remember – evolution 
can help!
Human hereditary colon cancer 
similar to MSH2 gene in yeas
gene was found by looking for a gene 
t (these genes are 65% similar)!
So what’s next?  
Genomics is a collaborative discipline 
• To study WHAT proteins DO, HOW 
they INTERACT, and HOW they 
are REGULATED, need data 
beyond genomic sequence
• Genomics/Bioinformatics is 
fundamentally a COLLABORATIVE 
and MULTIDISCIPLINARY effort
Car parts
Automobiles
Blueprints of 
automobile parts
DNA
People
Gene Expression
Now we are trying to understand how small 
differences in DNA lead to large differences in 
phenotypes
Proteins
Proteins
The answer is probably in regulation
“Gene Regulatory Circuits”
• Genes  =? wires
• Motifs =? gates
A B Make DC
If C then D
If B then NOT D
If A and B then D D
Make BD
If D then B
C
gene B
gene D
Regulatory Networks
Any questions?
What is genomics all about?
The “omes” in biology.
Why bioinformatics?
What is “systems biology”?
The “omes”
• Genome – organism’s complete set of DNA
– Relatively stable through an organism’s lifetime
– Size: from 600,000 to several billion bases
– Gene is a basic unit of heredity (only 2% of the 
human genome)
• Proteome – organism’s complete set of proteins
– Dynamic – changes minute to minute
– Proteins actually perform most cellular functions, they 
are encoded by genes (not a 1-to-1 relationship)
– Protein function and structure form molecular basis 
for disease
Beyond the “omes” – systems 
biology
• Understanding the function and regulation of 
cellular machinery, as well as cell-to-cell 
communication on the molecular level
• Why?  Because most important biological 
problems are fundamentally systems-level 
problems
– Systems-level understanding of disease (e.g. cancer)
– Molecular medicine
– Gene therapy
Systems-level challenges
• Gene function annotation – what does a gene do
– ~30,000 genes in the human genome => systems-level approaches 
necessary
– A modern human microarray experiment produces ~500,000 data points 
=> computational analysis & visualization necessary
– Many high-throughput functional technologies => computational 
methods necessary to integrate the data
• Biological networks – how do proteins interact
– Large amounts of high-throughput data => computation necessary to 
store and analyze it
– Data has variable specificity => computational approaches necessary to 
separate reliable conclusions from random coincidences
• Comparative genomics – comparing data between organisms
– Need to map concepts across organisms on a large scale => practically 
impossible to do by hand
– High amount of variable quality data => computational methods needed 
for integration, visualization, and analysis
– Data often distributed in databases across the globe, with variable 
schemas etc => data storage and consolidation methods needed
Function 
• To study WHAT proteins DO, HOW 
they INTERACT, and HOW they 
are REGULATED, need data 
beyond genomic sequence
• Genomics/Bioinformatics is 
fundamentally a COLLABORATIVE 
and MULTIDISCIPLINARY effort
Biological networks
• Interaction maps (no directions)
• Pathway models (dynamic or static)
• Metabolic networks
• Genetic regulatory networks

Gene expression microarrays
– one type of high-throughput 
functional data
Why microarray analysis: the 
questions
• Large-scale study of biological processes
• What is going on in the cell at a certain 
point in time?
• On the large-scale genetic level, what 
accounts for differences between 
phenotypes?
• Sequence important, but genes have 
effect through expression

What does it study?
Where do we get the data?
Computational Molecular Biology
• In order to gather insight into the ways in which genes and 
gene products (proteins) function, we:
• 1.  Analyze DNA and protein sequences, searching for 
clues about structure, function, and control. 
SEQUENCE ANALYSIS
• 2.  Analyze biological structures, searching for clues about 
sequence,  function and control.
STRUCTURE ANALYSIS
• 3.  Understand how cellular components function in living 
systems. 
FUNCTION ANALYSIS
What are functions of genes?
• Signal transduction: sensing a physical 
signal and turning into a chemical signal
• Structural support: creating the shape 
and pliability of a cell or set of cells
• Enzymatic catalysis: accelerating 
chemical transformations otherwise too 
slow.
• Transport: getting things into and out of 
separated compartments
What are the functions of 
genes?
• Movement:  contracting in order to pull 
things together or push things apart.
• Transcription control: deciding when other 
genes should be turned ON/OFF
• Trafficking: affecting where different 
elements end up inside the cell
Biology and Medicine are 
fundamentally information sciences.
