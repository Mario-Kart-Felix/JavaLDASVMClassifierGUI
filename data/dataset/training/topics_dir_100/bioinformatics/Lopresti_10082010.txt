Motivation
“Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on.”  
Donald Knuth (Stanford Professor & famous computer scientist)
By developing techniques for analyzing sequence data and related 
structures, we can attempt to understand molecular basis of life.

Data Explosion
To first approximation, DNA is 
a language over a four character 
alphabet, {A, C, G, T}. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/genbankstats.html

(1)  Adenine,
(2)  Cytosine,
(3)  Guanine,
(4)  Thymine.
Our genetic identity is
encoded in long molecules 
made up of four basic units,
the nucleic acids:

Algorithms are Central
Conduct experimental evaluations (perhaps iterate above steps).
An algorithm is a precisely-specified series of steps to solve a 
particular problem of interest.
Develop model(s) for task at hand.
Study inherent computational complexity:
Can task be phrased as an optimization problem?
If so, can it be solved efficiently?  Speed, memory, etc.
If we can't find a good algorithm, can we prove task is “hard”?
If known to be hard, is there approximation algorithm (one that 
works at least some of the time or comes close to optimal)?

Reading DNA
http://www.apelex.fr/anglais/applications/sommaire2/sanger.htm
http://www.iupui.edu/~wellsctr/MMIA/htm/animations.htm
In general, DNA molecules 
with similar lengths will 
migrate same distance.
Make DNA fragments that 
end at each base:  A, C, G, T. 
Then run gel and read off 
sequence:  ATCGTG ...
Gel electrophoresis is 
process of separating a 
mixture of molecules in a 
gel media by application of 
an electric field.
This is known as sequencing.

Sequencing a Genome
Most genomes are enormous (e.g., 1010 base pairs in case of 
human).  Current sequencing technology, on the other hand, only 
allows biologists to determine ~103 base pairs at a time.
This leads to some very interesting problems in bioinformatics ...

Genomes can also be determined using a technique known as 
shotgun sequencing.

Computer scientists have 
played an important role in 
developing algorithms for 
assembling such data.
It's kind of like putting 
together a jigsaw puzzle with 
millions of pieces (a lot of 
which are “blue sky”).

Sequence Comparison
Given new DNA or protein sequence, biologist will want to search 
databases of known sequences to look for anything similar.
Sequence similarity can provide clues about function and 
evolutionary relationships.
Databases such as GenBank are far too large to search manually.
To search them efficiently, we need an algorithm.
What's the problem?  Google for biologists ...
Shouldn't expect exact matches (so it's not really like google):
Genomes aren't static:  mutations, insertions, deletions.
Human (and machine) error in reading sequencing gels.

The Human Factor
In addition, errors can arise during the sequencing process:
“...the error rate is generally less than 1% over the first 650
bases and then rises significantly over the remaining sequence.”

Why not just line up sequences and count matches?
Doesn't work well in case of deletions or insertions:
One missing symbol at start of 
sequence leads to large difference!

Sequence Comparison
Model allows three basic operations:  delete a single symbol, 
insert a single symbol, substitute one symbol for another.
Goal:  given two sequences, find the shortest series of
operations needed to transform one into the other.

A G C T G T A
A G C T A T A
Delete T
Substitute G for A
Instead, we'll use a technique known as dynamic programming.

Sequence Comparison
Approach is to build up longer solutions from previously 
computed shorter solutions.
Say we want to compute solution at index i in first sequence 
and index j in second sequence:
Sequence 1 i Sequence 2 jvs.
Assume that we already know the best way to compare:
Sequence 1 i Sequence 2vs.
Sequence 1 Sequence 2 jvs.
Sequence 1 Sequence 2vs.
How can we determine optimal series of operations?

So, best way to do this comparison:
Sequence 1 i Sequence 2 jvs.
Is best choice from following three cases:
Sequence 1 i Sequence 2vs. + inserting j
Sequence 1 Sequence 2 jvs. + deleting i
Sequence 1 Sequence 2vs.
+ substituting 
for i

99% of mouse genes have homologues in human genome.
96% of mouse genes are in same relative location to one another. 
Mouse genome can be broken up into 300 synteny blocks which, 
when rearranged, yield human genome.
Provides a way to think about evolutionary relationships.

by pigmentary dysphasia.

but not clear where it was located.
“Splotch” mice:
A breed of mice (with splotch gene) had similar symptoms.
Scientists succeeded in identifying location of gene in mice.
This gave clues as to where same gene is located in humans.

DNA Microarrays
Given set of n data points and an integer k.
We want to find set of k points that minimizes the mean-squared 
distance from each data point to its nearest cluster center.
K-means clustering is one way to organize this data:
Choose k initial center points randomly and cluster data.
Calculate new centers for each cluster using points in cluster.
Re-cluster all data using new center points.
Repeat second two steps until no data points are moved from one 
cluster to another or some other convergence criterion is met.
