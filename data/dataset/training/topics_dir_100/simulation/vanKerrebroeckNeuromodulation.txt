Purpose: This 5-year, prospective, multicenter trial evaluated the long-term safety and efficacy of sacral neuromodulation
in patients with refractory urge incontinence, urgency frequency and retention.
Materials and Methods: A total of 17 centers worldwide enrolled 163 patients (87% female). Following test stimulation 11
patients declined implantation and 152 underwent implantation using InterStim®. Of those treated with implantation 96 (63.2%)
had urge incontinence, 25 (16.4%) had urgency frequency and 31 (20.4%) had retention. Voiding diaries were collected annually for
5 years. Clinical success was defined as 50% or greater improvement from baseline in primary voiding diary variable(s).
Results: Data for all implanted cases were reported. For patients with urge incontinence mean leaking episodes per day
decreased from 9.6  6.0 to 3.9  4.0 at 5 years. For patients with urgency frequency mean voids per day decreased from
19.3  7.0 to 14.8  7.6, and mean volume voided per void increased from 92.3  52.8 to 165.2  147.7 ml. For patients with
retention the mean volume per catheterization decreased from 379.9  183.8 to 109.2  184.3 ml, and the mean number of
catheterizations decreased from 5.3  2.8 to 1.9  2.8. All changes were statistically significant (p 0.001). No life
threatening or irreversible adverse events occurred. In 102 patients 279 device or therapy related adverse events were
observed. At 5 years after implantation 68% of patients with urge incontinence, 56% with urgency frequency and 71% with
retention had successful outcomes.
Conclusions: This long-term study demonstrates that InterStim therapy is safe and effective for restoring voiding in
appropriately selected cases refractory to other forms of treatment.

SACRAL NEUROMODULATION FOR VOIDING DYSFUNCTION2030nence and idiopathic constipation but these indications are
not approved in the United States. Many patients treated
with SNM experience an immediate clinical benefit that is
sustained during long-term followup. Several authors have
published their results with SNM, reporting on various fol-
lowup periods and success rates. As new techniques, devices,
and components emerge, analysis of long-term data, partic-
ularly those gathered from the original patient groups en-
rolled in FDA approved studies, is important to advance our
knowledge of SNM. This study, one of the earliest and larg-
est prospective, multicenter clinical trials of SNM therapy,
has concluded after 5 years of followup. We report here the
long-term results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This PAS was a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter,
followup study initiated after FDA approval of InterStim
therapy. Most of the enrolled patients (129) were already
implanted with InterStim system for treatment of UI, UF
and nonobstructive urinary retention as part of the multi-
center, randomized controlled study (MDT-103) and were
consecutively crossed over to the long-term followup study.
All 17 ethical committees approved the long-term PAS pro-
tocol and each patient signed informed consent before study
participation. Of the 23 centers participating in the original
randomized study (MDT-103) 6 declined to participate in the
PAS and those patients were excluded from further fol-
lowup.1,2 No significant differences between patients from
the declined and participating centers could be identified.
Patient Selection and Evaluation
The PAS study enrolled a total of 163 patients. Demographic
data for 1 patient were not available. The mean age was
44.7  11.2 years with 21 males (13%) and 141 females
(87%). By indication 103 patients (64%) had UI, 28 (17%)
had UF and 31 (19%) had complete or incomplete urinary
retention. A total of 129 patients crossed over from the
MDT-103 study and 34 were enrolled under the new PAS
protocol. Of those 34 patients, 23 were implanted with the
InterStim system and 11 declined permanent implantation
despite a positive response to test stimulation. The 5-year
results for all 152 implanted cases are reported.
The PAS study used a patient followup protocol similar to
the original MDT-103 study.12,13 Compared to the MDT-103
study, the PAS required annual followup visits, and used
more advanced devices (eg test stimulation leads, implant-
able neurostimulators) and new techniques (eg neurostimu-
lator implantation in the buttock). The majority of patients
had the INS implanted in the abdomen (121) and only 31
patients who were enrolled later on, had the INS implanted
in the buttock. The criteria for rating clinical success based
on patient voiding diaries and methods for reporting and
analyzing AEs remained unchanged. The required data at
annual followup visits for all patients who underwent im-
plantation included a voiding diary completed for a mini-
mum of 3 days, and simple uroflow and quality of life ques-
tionnaires. The Short Form-36 and the Beck Depression
Inventory were used. Detailed data were also collected on
any concomitant treatment for the urological condition and
on any therapy or patient related complications.
The voiding dysfunction indications (UI, UF and reten-
tion) were represented by unique primary voiding diaryvariables on which therapy outcome was measured. For
patients with UI these diary variables include number of
leaking episodes daily, number of heavy leaking episodes
daily and number of pads used daily. For patients with UF
the variables included number of voids daily, volume voided
per void and degree of urgency experienced before void. For
patients with retention the variables included catheterized
volume per catheterization and number of catheterizations
daily. InterStim therapy was considered successful if 50% or
more improvement occurred in any of primary voiding diary
variables compared with baseline. Safety data were reported
for all implanted cases. Descriptive summaries were pro-
vided for device or therapy related AEs and also those re-
quiring surgical intervention.
Patient Disposition
In this long-term followup study patients were followed for up
for 5 years. Due to the long followup period, some scheduled
followup visits were missed and not all patients provided a
voiding diary at each followup visit. Table 1 provides a break-
down of the followup elements by patient group (ie number of
visits, diaries and explants) at each followup period.
A total of 138 patients completed 1-year followup and 121
patients completed the 1-year voiding diary. At 5 years a total
of 105 patients completed followup and 87 completed the void-
ing diary. There were 47 patients who did not have 5-year data,
and 16 of them had the system explanted and withdrew due to
lack of efficacy or complications. The last followup visit with
diary data occurred on average at 49.3 months  15.9 (range
11 to 60) following implantation for the 145 patients with at
least 1 followup diary past 12 months.
Statistical Analysis
For each of the primary voiding diary parameters relevant
for measurement of UI, UF and retention, statistical com-
parisons were made between baseline and postimplantation
using a repeated measure analysis. A clinical success rate (ie
percent of patients with 50% or more improvement in the
voiding diary variable) at each visit was calculated for each
primary voiding diary variable. Patients who exited the
study due to an adverse event or lack of efficacy were con-
sidered unsuccessful and were assumed to return to their

SACRAL NEUROMODULATION FOR VOIDING DYSFUNCTION 2031baseline. For patients who missed a study visit or failed to
provide the voiding diary at a scheduled visit for other
reasons, the last observation carried forward was used to
impute missing data. A sensitivity analysis based on all
implanted cases with valid followup and diary data were
also performed to assess the robustness of the results.
RESULTS
Efficacy for Urge Incontinence
The average number of leaking episodes per day at baseline
for patients with UI was 9.6  6.0. This decreased to 4.7 
4.9 at 1-year followup and the reduction was maintained
throughout followup with an average of 3.9  4.0 at 5 years
after implantation (part A of figure). The number of heavy
leaks per day decreased from 2.6  3.3 at baseline to 1.2 
2.7 at 1-year followup, and to 0.8  1.7 at 5 years after
implantation. Patients with urge incontinence also showed a
decrease in the number of pads used per day from more than
5 at baseline to 1.8 at 5 years after implantation. A clinical
success rate of 58% was observed in number of leaks per day,
68% in number of heavy leaks per day and 61% in number of
pads used per day at 5-year followup (table 2).
Efficacy for Urgency Frequency
The average number of voids per day decreased from
19.3  7.0 at baseline to 13.0  7.9 at 1-year followup for
patients with UF. The reduction was maintained through-
out followup with a slight increase to 14.8  7.6 at 5 years
after implantation (part B of figure). The average voided
volume increased from 92.3  52.8 ml at baseline to 169.9 
118.2 ml 1 year after implantation and effectiveness was
maintained throughout the long-term followup period with
an average of 165.2  147.7 at 5 years after implantation.
Patients with urgency/frequency reported a decrease in de-
gree of urgency per day from 2.3  0.6 at baseline to 1.9 
0.8 at 1-year followup and to 2.1  0.7 at 5-year followup.
A clinical success rate of 40% was observed in number of
voids per day, and 56% in degree of urgency per day at 5
years after implantation for patients with UF, and 56%
experienced a 50% or more increase in the average volume
voided per void. Of the patients with a successful clinical
outcome after 1 year implant 71% remained successful at
5-year followup (table 2).
Efficacy for Urinary Retention
The average number of catheterizations per day decreased
from 5.3  2.8 at baseline to 1.9  2.8, and 58% clinical
success rate was observed at 5 years after implantation. The
average catheterized volume per catheterization decreased
from 379.9  183.8 ml at baseline to 109.2  184.3 ml, and
clinical success rate of 71% was observed at 5 years after
implantation (part C of figure, table 2).
Of those patients with an unsuccessful therapy outcome,
the therapy failure period ranged from 6 to 60 months after
implantation with a mean failure period of 24 months for all
indications. To assess the robustness of reported results,
sensitivity analysis was performed based on all evaluable
patients with valid visits and diary data. Consistent results
were obtained and, thus, not presented. The quality of life
scores (Short Form-36 and Beck Depression Inventory)
showed some improvement but this was not statisticallysignificant. Interpretation of these data is limited because of
the generic nature of the selected questionnaires which were
the only methods available at the time the study was de-
signed.
Safety
The safety data were reported based on all implanted cases.
There were 102 (67%) patients who had at least 1 device or
therapy related adverse event. A total of 221 AEs were re-
corded and most (96%) were resolved by the time the data were
analyzed. A total of 110 adverse events required surgery in 60
patients. There were 92 patients analyzed who underwent
implantation and did not have adverse events requiring surgi-
cal intervention. Overall the system was explanted from 16

SACRAL NEUROMODULATION FOR VOIDING DYSFUNCTION2032Of the adverse events in 102 patients 31 were device
related (24 patients, 15.8%) and 240 were therapy related
(97 patients, 63.8%) (table 3). Among the therapy related
events the most frequently reported event was new pain or
undesirable change in stimulation, which occurred 60 times
in 41 patients (27.0% of all patients). Pain at PNE or the
implant site related to the INS was the second most com-
monly reported event, occurring 40 times in 30 patients
(19.7% of all patients). Of all device related adverse events,
the most frequently reported were suspected device prob-
lems (5.3%) and suspected lead migration (3.3%) (table 3).
Throughout the 5-year followup surgical intervention
was required to resolve adverse events in 60 patients (110
events). Device exchange, which included replacement of a
lead, extension or INS, was the most common intervention,
resulting from 52 adverse events in 36 patients (23.7%). The
types of surgical interventions performed are shown in
table 4, including the percentage of patients who experi-
enced an adverse event requiring those interventions. These
figures include a group of patients who had an INS exchange
because of battery depletion. A total of 60 (39.5%) patients
experienced adverse event requiring surgical intervention
with 36 (23.7%) requiring device exchange. Of the 152 pa-
tients treated with implantation 92 (60.5%) did not have an
adverse event requiring surgical intervention.
DISCUSSION
This long-term, prospective, multicenter, FDA regulated study
represents the most comprehensive followup study of sacral
neuromodulation therapy with the largest patient population
to be analyzed or published to date. The efficacy data confirm
sustained clinical benefit of sacral neuromodulation that has

cannot assess new therapeutic advancements that occur after
the study begins, which may potentially affect patient selec-
tion, procedure techniques, devices used and overall patient
outcomes. Another disadvantage of this study is the missing
data due to patients not attending at scheduled visits or be-
coming lost to followup. Therefore, clinical implication from
this study should be interpreted with caution although a sen-
sitivity analysis was performed based on all evaluable data.
Nonetheless, this long-term study demonstrates that approxi-
mately 70% of the treated patients continued to experience
therapeutic benefit after 5 years of the treatment. The approx-
imately 30% of the patients who did not benefit from the
treatment between 6 and 24 months of followup is consistent
with previously published literature.10
Many possible explanations exist for treatment failure,
including potential placebo effect of test stimulation, insuf-
ficient test stimulation sensitivity before implantation and
inadequate patient selection (eg severe disease state at
study enrollment, presence of specific mental conditions and
previous sociomedical history). For instance Weil et al, re-
porting on their long-term results in 36 patients, found a
striking correlation between secondary loss of therapeutic
effect and the presence of preexisting psychiatric disorders
in the medical history.9 However, the effect of psychiatric
disorders on the efficacy of neuromodulation has not been
established.
An important finding in this study is the high correlation
between 1 and 5-year success rates for treated patients.

SACRAL NEUROMODULATION FOR VOIDING DYSFUNCTION 20331-year followup and continued to have a successful outcome
at 5 years after implantation.
SNM has proved to be safe therapy that does not preclude
any other treatment options. The midterm safety profile of
SNM was established in the original MDT-103 study with
219 implanted cases.12 No reports of any life threatening or
irreversible adverse events have been made in this or any
previous studies of neuromodulation for urinary conditions.
Of the 271 reported adverse events 110 required surgery in
60 patients. The most common surgical interventions were
device exchange or device repositioning, which are generally
considered minor surgical procedures. Pain at PNE or im-
plant site necessitating surgical intervention was the most
common indication occurring in 11.8% of implanted cases
throughout the course of the study. The second and third
most common indications requiring surgical intervention
were suspected lead migration and new pain or undesirable
change in stimulation. As 12 of the 14 patients experiencing
these adverse events had undergone implantation with an
older Itrel II® INS, which has been superseded by the new
InterStim INS, the midterm and long-term number of device
related surgical interventions is expected to decrease. INS
exchange due to battery depletion will continue to occur on
average every 8 years. (InterStim Therapy [package insert],
Minneapolis, Minnesota: Medtronic, Inc. 1997, 1999.) How-
ever, this is a minor intervention performed on an outpa-
tient basis with the patient under local anesthesia.
In 1999 the placement of the INS was changed from the
abdomen to the buttock because buttock placement resulted
in less pain and fewer infections postoperatively, which min-
imized the need for INS repositioning, and reduced operat-
ing time.15 Despite lack of randomized controlled trials on
effect of buttock vs abdominal placement and its impact on
the rate of surgical reoperation, clinical data seems to con-
firm a convincingly reduced rate of INS related complaints.
Analysis of the occurrence of surgically corrected adverse
events in both treatment groups in our study revealed that
the reoperation rate due to pain at the INS site decreased in
cases of buttock placement. The difference was not statisti-
cally significant due to the relatively small number of pa-
tients who were enrolled in the study with the buttock
neurostimulator implant.
At 1-year followup 19.9% of the patients had adverse
event resulting in surgical intervention, which increased to
42.1% by 5-year followup. Of 152 implanted cases 92 did not

Any adverse event 60 (39.5) 110have an adverse event requiring surgical intervention. Al-though this is a relatively high number we emphasize that
this was the first study in which SNM therapy was offered to
quite severely affected patients and with a steep learning
curve.
It should also be noted that patients who experienced loss
of therapeutic effect often underwent revision surgery be-
cause it was believed at the time that new lead placement or
switching to the contralateral side would restore benefit.
Revision surgeries were performed and repeated on each
patient when a technical problem occurred, the device had to
be replaced, or when pain complaints indicated a problem. A
later study demonstrated that loss of therapeutic effect often
cannot be resolved with revision surgery.14
Patient selection and the SNM operating technique in-
volved a steep learning curve. Some of the devices and sur-
gical techniques used early in the study have been replaced
by major advancements within the last 3 years. For exam-
ple, the technique has become minimally invasive with use
of a percutaneous tined lead placement with the patient
under local anesthesia that allows patient participation to
help determine sensory responses.
Reported adverse event rates from recent literature are
between 11% and 22%. Specifically for surgical revision, the
rates range from 7% to 18% with followup from 7 to 24
months.16–18 This clearly demonstrates a reduction in the
adverse event rate with the new technology (minimally in-
vasive technique and use of the tined lead and upper buttock
INS placement).
Much has been learned at each center regarding the
requirements for success, including the need for experienced
personnel and appropriate hospital setup for optimal ther-
apy delivery. These improvements are now being practiced
in all centers providing SNM therapy.
CONCLUSIONS
This long-term study dramatically advanced overall knowl-
edge of sacral neuromodulation therapy for urinary dysfunc-
tion. The results show that sacral neuromodulation safely
and effectively provides long-term relief for appropriately
selected patients with refractory UI, UF and urinary reten-
tion. SNM is a safe, reversible, minimally invasive method
that may be an appropriate alternative to more invasive
techniques for well selected patients. Although much has
been learned, methods can still be optimized. Further re-
search is warranted to elicit the mechanism of action, to
improve patient selection and the sensitivity of percutane-
ous test stimulation, and to avoid adverse events after im-
plantation.
